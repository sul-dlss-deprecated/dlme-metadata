Caravans passing, but safety doubtful. 2. Kerman-Yezd. Caravans passing ; comparatively safe. 3. Ahwaz—Ispahan. 8afe, althoughBakhtiari predict raids by Kuhgeluis, who, as reported in my telegram No. 141, have been withdrawn from Bakhtiari’ control. Persian Oovernment have failed to induce Gfovernor-Gfeneral of Pars to give governor ship of Behbehan, which includes the control of the Ivuhgeluis, to someone friendly to Bakhtiari. Disorders on road are therefore likely. 4. Ispahan-Kum. Very unsafe south of Kashan. Four British subjects robbed since 1st January. o. Bushire—Ispahan, to which I presume complaints of the Manchester firms particularly apply. These firms must be under a misapprehension. There has, according to reports from His Majesty’s consuls at Bushire and Shiraz, been a considerable improvement since last year. On Bushire-Shiraz section no robbery has been reported for a considerable time. Since December there has been none in which British goods were involved. The tribal migration took place without the usual damage to telegraph line. Merchants complain, however, that transport is scarce, consequently few caravans are passing. On Shiraz-Ispahan section there has recently been a good deal of raiding by .Kuhgeluis near Kumisheh, but the last robbery involving British goods occurred on 1st April, and caravans are now passing fairly freely. No doubt chance of a continuation of this improvement, which is not due to any increased authority of the central Government and must largely depend on Soulet’s good-will, is very precarious, but ,the moment has certainly not come to insist on our scheme. Even were things worse than they are it would only be with exireme reluctance that I would recommend pressing for our scheme, which would greatly embarrass Persian Government, whose equilibrium is already none too stable. Moreover, I very much doubt whether insistence, unless we are prepared to under take the measures necessary to compel acceptance and execution of our scheme, which would probably involve temporary occupation of the roads, would have any useful result. It is not for me to judge at what moment complaints of Manchester firms may render it necessary for His Majesty’s Government to face unpleasant possibilities indicated above, but I would point out that most recently published customs statistics, those for the ten months ending 21st January last, show an increase of 12 per cent, over previous years in the southern receipts, the increase in the Mohammerah and Bunder Abbas receipts more than counterbalancing the decrease at Bushire, and Mohammerah receipts are independent of oil company’s imports, which do not pay duty. (Last two paragraphs repeated to Bushire and Shiraz.) [453—366 rACONFIDENTIAL. A / * 1 -&gt; Sir Edward Grey to Sir G. Barclay (Tehran). (No. 167.) Foreign Office, May 24, 1911, 6 p.m. MANCHESTER firms again complain of insecurity on southern roads, condition of which, according to them, so far from having improved, is now worse than ever. I should be glad to learn by telegraph whether this is so. If facts are as stated, do you consider that measures undertaken by Persian Government may now be considered to have definitely failed after fair trial, and that it is time to insist on our scheme as only means of restoring order and saving British trade ? It is difficult longer to combat arguments of firms interested in favour of this course. [453—336Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received February 6 ) (No. 2.) * ’’ ^ r ’ T TTKATjr i . , .

I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. Enclosure in No. 1. Sir G. Barclay to Mohteshem-es-Saltaneh. M. le Ministre, January 21, 1911. 1 DID not fail to communicate to my Government the Vazir Zadeh’s note of the 28th December, and I have been instructed to inform your Excellency that His Majesty’s Government have learned with satisfaction that the Persian Government is taking special measures to restore order on the southern roads. Reports from His Majesty’s consular officers show, however, that the diminution of robberies on the main route from Bushire to Shiraz which has characterised the past few weeks is due not so much to any arrangements so far made by Soulet-ed-Dowleh for the guarding of the road, as to the unusual severity of the weather. Until therefore the execution of the measures decided upon by the Persian Government has made more progress, His Majesty s Government are unable to judge whether these measures are likely to form an acceptable substitute for the scheme outlined in my note of the 14th October. Meanwhile, however, His Majesty’s Government recognise in the Persian Govern ment’s decision to take these measures evidence that it is determined to do its utmost to restore order on the southern trade routes, and are therefore disposed to defer pressing their scheme on the Persian Government pending the results of the further development of the measures in question. I am to state, however, that it must be clearly understood that His Majesty’s Government will reconsider this expectant attitude in the event of a recrudescence of disorders on the Bushire-Ispahan road, and that they reserve the right to insist on the engagement of British-Indian officers at any moment should His Majesty’s Government perceive that the measures taken by the Persian Government are not likely to suffice for the prompt re-establishment of security. With regard to the proposed customs surcharge, I am instructed to point out to your Excellency that the surcharge would be virtually a tax on British trade. His Majesty’s Government consider the imposition of this additional burden, in the circum stances, justifiable as a temporary expedient if British officers are responsible to the Persian Government for the organisation of the force, the cost of which the surcharge was designed to meet. They cannot, however, consent to it merely as a means of enabling the Persian Government to attempt to perform a duty which ought to be a fixed charge on the ordinary Persian revenues, without any guarantee that the attempt will be successful.

Trade routes in southern Persia. The road from Bushire as far as Shiraz is fairly passable, but this is partly due to the fact that there is still much snow about, and partly to the fact that the Governor General is halted halfway. These aids to security will not however long pre vail. The Bunder Abbas-Kerman, Bunder Abbas-Lar and Shiraz- Ispahan routes are all most insecure and reports have lately been received of heavy robberies. The new Governor General does not seem to be making any serious progress, while as regards Fars and the south generally, the reports of Consuls at Kerman, Shiraz, Bunder Abbas and Lingah are most pessimistic. The probability of our having to make good the British note seems therefore to be by no means remote. Hitherto when the only question has been as to the choice of alternative mule tracks between Bushire and Shiraz I have consistently pressed for adherence to Kazerun route; it is not only shorter but possesses advantages in caravan serais and telegraph line; but it is admittedly out of the question as alignment for a railway or motor transport service. I have just received from Mr. Chick a memorandum on the road question in which he urges that if it becomes necessary for us to participate in policing a route to Shiraz, it should be one which could be adapted for motor transport, and with that idea he invites attention to the Firozabad ro&amp;d. If this route affords a feasible alignment for motor transport at all, the journey would be performed in four days at the outside when once the track is in work inging oilier, bad the task of policing, if necessary at all, would not present great difficulty. Moreover, differing in this respect from the Kazeruu route, the Firozshad road irould have the advantage of lying mainly in the sphere of one trihe, the Kashgais, whose chiefs are well-disposed towards us, and being alive to their own interests might be expected to co-operate. Mr. Chick has gone into figures, prifflajkgcia, these indicate that a motor transport service by this route would be commercially lucrative. Before, however, we could be sufficiently sure of this to ;u: tirv our recommending the project to any British or Anglo-Persian syndicate, the road would require to be examined by an expert in hill roads and railways, who could form an opinion on the alignment and give an approximate estimate of cost per mile. The matter seems to be one of immediate interest, since it might even be worth while to make grant of a concession for a transport project on the Firosabad road, a condition of our abstain ing from placing British officers on the laserun route, I' ' r ' c ' tsarina cion of route is not carried out this spring it will not be possible to take it in hand till the autumn. Could the Government of India possibly spare the services of Captain L. Hopkins, R.I., who surveyed the Ahwaz-Shiraz route in 1903, or failing him some other engineer expert ? It would be necessary for him to arrive here by the end of March. The Soulet ed Dowleh would be starting up the road about that time and the engineer officer would then have the advanetge of Soulfcfc's pres ence. I could send one of my staff with him. If the idea ig - i - faci - ? c °Mds itself to Government of India and His Majesty's Minister, and if engineer officer can be red immediately, I beg to be informed as early as possible so that I may invite Goulet ed Dowleh to delay hlS :tart to allow of officers accompanying him.

Shiraz-Ispahan Road: trs. memo, of Mr. Moir with observations. I have the honour to transmit herewith a memorandum kindly furnished me by Mr. Moir, local Manager of Messrs. Ziegler, regarding the Shiraz-Ispahan road. Mr. Moir, who is the first Western traveller to pass along this road since last May, reached Shiraz on January 22nd. Mr. Moir’s description of the road agrees with my information and the accounts I have from time to time given you. I cannot lay too much stress on ? the fact that the Persian Government have as yet taken no special measures to ensure a reasonable amount of continuous security upon the Ispahan-Shiraz road. The Bushire road has been entrusted to Sowlet-ed-Dowleh, whdse willing- 1 ness or ability to protect that route permanently has yet to be proved. The re-establishment of order along the Bushire-Ispahan road is, therefore, as yet quite problematical. The immediate future of the road will depend largely on Nizam-es' Sultaneh and the measures he is able to take for its effective policing. Probably the only measure which could ensure a certain amount of durable security on the Ispahan-Shiraz road would be to entrust that section to some powerful magnate, such as Nasr-ed-Dowleh, in the same manner as the Bushire road has been entrusted to Sowlet-ed-Dowleh. As I have reported, the Persian Government have been negotiating on the subject with Nasr-ed-Dowleh but these negotiations have hitherto been abortive owing to the failure of the Persian Government to make any arrangements for the financing of the scheme. I would also lay stress on the fact that the opening of the Ispahan road is i at present the essential requirement. Different roads between Shiraz and Bushire have been open, with brief interruption, for an entire year, while the Ispahan road has been closed to regular traffic during the whole of that period. Shiraz is mainly a distributing centre, and the opening of the Bushire road is commercially almost valueless, unless a road is also opened to the north. I have frequently referred to the deplorable condition of the northern postal service, which is practically moribund. In fact, letters for Tehran are now generally sent via Bushire and Baghdad. Caravans only proceed fitfully along the Ispahan road and can only get through safely by taking special guards and by paying blackmail, often extortionate, to the brigands on the way. No mer chants, who can afford to hold their hand, are forwarding to Ispahan. With reference to the Kurdshulis mentioned by Mr. Moir, these people were until last summer peaceful, well-behaved villagers. Their village, Kurdshul, near Tang-i-Bulaki, was completely plundered by the Arabs of Feza Kuli Khan last September (see my diary of September 10th last) and the unfortunate villagers, being quite ruined, have taken to brigandage for a liveli hood. I have on several occasions reported their activity, especially last October in connection with the damage done to the northern telegraph wires. Tke\ have for the last three months been blocking the Tang-i-Bulaki levying blackmail onthe caravans which occasionally pass. The case of tunately far from being unique, and one of r^nTCTrihal ihr anarchy ill Pars is the way m which peaceful villagers, ruined oy i depredations are taking to brigandage as the only means of earning a mng. is credibly reckoned that in the last two years more than one quarter of the total corn-land rf Pars has gone out of cultivation. It is only the marvellous fertility of TVs which has hitherto saved the province from fa “® e n ^ ”dtm rities doubt whether a famine can be eventually averted, unless the dlS0ld . e are nerceptibly diminished. The various tribal chiefs are everywhere levym 0 taxes on their own account, and the authority of the G^^enUs no^ recog nised at all, even as a matter of form, in the greater part of the pi ovine . I venture to invite your attention to Mr. Moir’s remarks on the subject o Sowlet-ed-Dowleh’s behaviour towards Ibrahim Khan of Surmeh. I am su that all European travellers who have enjoyed Ibrahim Khan s courteous hospitality and P protection, will equally regret that the only capable honest official engaged in the policing of the road should be subjected to such t ment by the brigand who is, apparently to the complete satisfaction of the Persian Government, masquerading as the Warden of the Road^. These incidents are occurring everywhere and are due partly to Sowlet s msatia 3 avarice and partly, perhaps, to his natural hostility towards all partisans ot order. Eor instance, on the Bushire road, Mulla Khurshid of Kamarij has consistently kept order in his district, treated travellers with honour, paid is taxes and governed his dependents with rude justice. Sowlet-ed-Dowleh has for the last two years being doing his best to bring about the rum of Khurshi and is now inciting Nizam-es-Sultaneh to attack Kamarij. It is hardly to be wondered that the most law-abiding persons are, in despair, taking to brigand age which alone ensures them respect and peace. £ Enclosure in Mr. Smart's despatch No. 6 of 3rd February 1911. Ispahan-Shiraz Road. I left Ispahan on 3rd January. I found the road to Koomisheh in good order and undisturbed, but I was struck by the change in Mayar which seven years ago, when I last travelled on this road, was a prosperous village and is now practically deserted. Prom Koomisheh onwards my own charvadars and those of another small caravan which accompanied mine seemed to be living in perpetual dread of an attack by robbers, and I have no doubt that the fact that we got through to Shiraz safely is due solely to the intensely cold weather which prevailed and to the very deep snow lying in the passes wffiere an attack might have been expected. ^ ^ Between Koomisheh and Abadeh traces of the devastation worked by the Kuhgelus and the Boir Ahmedis last year were very apparent. The village of Maqsud Beg, Aminabad and Shulgistan seemed to have been deserted by the greater part of the villagers: even the doors of the caravansarais, as also those of the caravansarai at Yesdikhast, had been torn down and presumably burnt by the robbers. Blocks were scarce and no crops had been sown, ^ the villagers, with whom I spoke, telling me that they saw no object in keeping flocks and sowing crops for the robbers to carry off. The same conditions prevail between Abadeh and Sivend although not to such a marked extent, and with the almost entire absence of caravans along the road during the past year, the condition of the villagers is one of great destitution. Guards are very few and far between, and the few that one can obtain in various places would certainly be of no use in the case of an attack by robbers. In fact I am convinced that they would refuse to accompany me if there were any danger of an attack. As a case in point, at Dehbid I managed to raise three sowars and five tofangchis to accompany me, but as there were rumours of the presence of robbers at Khaneh Kergoon, probably inhabitants of that place—my guards absolutely refused to go by that road and I was compelled to go to a place called Abbasabad—quite off the beaten track—and thence to Dih Koh—a very much longer road. On my remarking that it is the duty of road guards to go for any robbers they had news of, my guards apparently concludedthat I was a little madder than other Firanghis they had had dealings with At Dili Noh, where it is even more essential than elsewhere to obtain guards in order to get through the famous Tang-i-Bulak, I could only raise three Koor- shoolis, notorious robbers. On my enquiring whether three of them were suffi cient to see me througli such a dangerous place they replied quite candidly &lt;£ Sahib, our own people are the robbers of this district, one of us is sufficient to see a caravan through if we wish. ” Why they should have wished to see me safely through rather than loot my caravan is a mystery. As it was they would have exacted a very large sum from the small caravan which accom panied mine if I had’nt intervened and beaten down their demands. lam certain that if I had not been present, and the charvadars had not been able to stump up the amount demanded, the caravan would have been looted par tially at least. The fact is as I learned on the road—that charvadars are almost as alarmed at the sight of a so-called road guard as of an undisguised robber. In Abadeh I learned that the visit of the Soulet-ed-Douleh to that place last summer had been very unwelcome. The Kashgais got out of hand and appa rently looted the people almost as badly as the KuhgeJus and Boir Ahmedis did later in the year. The only local headman who appeared to be making any serious attempt to keep his district in order was Ibrahim Khan of Surmeh, and one is forced to conjecture that this was the pogeon which led Soulet to summon him to Abadeh and keep him in chains there until he had jaid some thousands of tomans. . conclusion I would say that I found not the slightest trace of any steps ‘ having been taken by the Persian Government to restore and maintain order on the road. The road will no doubt be temporarily secure for a month or so owing to the severe weather and the presence of Fath-u-Mulk’s troops. But when these troops reach Shiraz (I cannot learn that they are to be distributed among vari ous stations on the road) and the tribes commence trekking to their Sarhad quarters there is not the slightest reason to hope that the road will be in any ft better condition than last year. In my opinion, the only method to maintain order and to keep the road open is to have sowars patrolling the road and to have small bodies of efficient, well armed and disciplined men posted at each stage on the road. By “ disciplined ” I mean more particularly men who will be content with their pay and will not harass charvadars in the manner of the old type of road guard. That such men can be found in Persia or that the Persian Government—even given the necessary money—would pay them well and regularly are aims which appear to have little prospect of attainment. Shiraz ; The 2nd February 1911. ION MOIR.No. 479, dated Bushire, the 26th February ( received 7th March ) 1911. ( Confidential.) From—Lieutenant-Colonel P. Z. Cox, C.S.I., C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. In continuation of my letter No. 242, dated 29th January 1911, I have the honour to forward, for the information of the Government of India, copies of “ Shiraz News ” for the weeks ending 21st and 28th of January and 3rd Febru ary, together with a copy of a despatch ( No. 5 dated 27th January ) addressed by Mr. Smart to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran urging the inadvisability bf increasing the already excessive number of sarbaz in Shiraz who in their destitute condition are already a danger to the community. Enclosure 1. Shiraz News. Nizam-es-Sultaneh telegraphed to Nasr-ed-Dowleh to send a regiment of infantry and some sowars to Bushire, where His Excellency would wait for these troops. Nasr-ed-Dowleh telegraphed that 4,000 tomans were necessary to despatch the troops. Nizam repdied that he had no money and asked Nasr-ed- Dowleh to fork out. Nasr-ed-Dowleh refused on the ground that he had already spent 30,000 tomans of his own money on the troops and was stony broke. Nasr-ed-Dowleh is so hard up that he is selling one of his town houses. Nizam’s attitude has strengthened the almost universal belief, general even among Sowlet’s adherents, that his mission is doomed to failure. The spectacle of Sowlet at Bushire, owingithe Government 400,000 tomans Maliyat, and Nizam hung up there for a paltry 4,000 tomans, is not an edifying one for the Shirazis, quick to see the ridiculous side of things. Sowlet has grown enormously rich on the disorders; the Kawamis have been ruined thereby. Sowlet has never helped the Government pecuniarily; the Kawamis during the last two years have consistently^ shelled out for the Government. And yet Nizam tries to bleed the Kawamis. On January 17th Sowlet telegraphed from Bushire to Nasir-ul-Mulk, asking what appointment in the south the latter would like from the ^Governor Gene ral. Nasir-ul-Mulk replied that, in spite of his love for the life retired, he would be pleased to accept the Governorship of the Gulf Ports. He added : “ Don’t forget Beha-es-Sultaneh. ” Sowlet seems convinced that he has got Nizam in his pocket, and this belief is generally shared by people here. The most curious feature of the situation is the apathy of the Kawamis, who, in spite of the jubilation of Sowlet’s partisans at Nizam’s pro-Sowlet attitude, have hitherto refrained from any sort of agitation. I am inclined to think that this inaction is due to the wisdom acquired of bitter experience, that the Kawamis have now become more prudent in stirring up disorders, that they are waiting. Many, however, think that the Kawamis, ruined financially and mortally weakened among the Arabs by the Sipahdar, Zafar-es-Sultaneh regime, have lost hope. Nasr-ed-Dowleh has repeatedly asked leave to go to Europe, but Eirman Eirma has definitely replied that, as long as he is Minister of War, he will not let Nasr-ed-Dowleh leave Ears. Unless the Kawami brothers are sent right out of the country, I see no hope in this pro-Sowlet Government. But, if the Kawamis go, the Govern ment will be without any protection against Sowlet, when he begins to play the fool. Nature seems to be doing her best for Persia at this juncture. Nobody seems to remember snow as heavy as we have had during the past week. The whole country is deep in snow and the roads momentarily^deserted by brigands. Ali Khan, Zaigbam’s full brother, has come into Shiraz with 100 Kashkai horsemen, whom he should take to Yezd. Azizullah Khan, the Ispahan postal contractor, has proposed that the post should go from Shiraz to Ispahan via Yezd, thus changing the double into a single service, much to the pecuniary advantage of the Post Office. The public,J V I who would of course suffer by this arrangement, are apparently not considered. It is true that, in view of the moribund state of the northern postal service, the public, who mostly send their northern letters ma Bushire, probably contem plate Azizullah’s proposal with complete indifference. With reference to the negotiations between the Persian Grovemment and the Nasr-ed-Dowleh regarding the Ispahan road (see News of 10th December last), the Persian Government suddenly telegraphed to Nasr-ed-Dowleh that he was responsible for that road. He replied, m astonishment, that he had received no answer to his conditions and had consequently taken no steps m the matter. The Persian Government fatuously replied by curtly reaffirming his responsibility. Kawam then telegraphed asking the Persian Government whether they were mad and what arrangements they had made regarding JN asr- ed-Dowleh’s conditions. The Persian Government replied that the necessary arrangements would be made after the arrival of the Governor-General, Inshallah, “ but this does not relieve Nasr-ed-Dowleh of responsibility for the road now.” Nasr-ed-Dowleh continues to protest that he has nothing to do with the road. The Ispahan road still in same forlorn state—no post from the north for over a fortnight. The Kazeroun road is normal. Sowlet continues to exact his 1,000 tomans a month from the muleteers. One of his agents here telegraphed to him that he had better telegraph to Tehran and deny the report that he was still levying tolls. Sowlet will no doubt have no objection to telegraphing another lie. Shiraz : 21st January 1911. 1 W. A. SMART. Enclosure 2. Shiraz News. In last week’s news I forgot to report the murder on 15th January of two .Jewish pedlars by sarbaz. Eight sarbaz and a woman, their common mistress, have been arrested and the murderers are apparently among them, but hitherto the investigation has failed in singling out the guilty. The motive of the murder was robbery. The Jews brought the corpses to the Consulate and deposited them in front of my bedroom window, whence they were removed after considerable persuasion. I made private representations on the subject to the local authorities. More heavy snow. The Kazeroun road has been blocked. The posts both ways have been hung up for over a week. Mr. Knox with the reliefs of the Shiraz detachment and Consular escort is held up at Kazeroun. ' An accumulation of 6 posts from the north arrived here on 22nd January, with letters from Ispahan dated 22nd December and letters from Tehran dated 6th December. As a result of my complaints about the northern postal service, the Postmaster called on me this morning to make his apologia. He read me telegraphic correspondence with the Minister of Posts, showing that the Postmaster had strongly represented the deplorable state of the Shiraz-Ispahan service and urged, as the only means of its resuscitation, the acceptance of the Postal Contractor’s terms, i.e., that the Persian Government should give satis factory guarantees that compensation will be immediately paid for every horse hereafter robbed. Asadullah Mirza, entirely ignoring the main question, replied perhaps facetiously, that as the Governor-General “ has arrived ” at the seat of his Government with ample forces, the Postmaster had no further excuse for irregularities in the postal service ! The kasid question is getting serious on the northern road. No kasid does the journey more than once: after enduring the hardships of a journey on foot through the snow and amidst dangers from brigands, the kasids decline to return. Thus, only from time to time is somebody found, often quite from out’ side the administration to take the bags. Then he hangs himself on to caravans proceeding with special guards and generally takes three weeks between Shiraz and Abadeh. miV al ' 8 ' 'y,™ ^ Senerany Delieyed to be working for a reconciliation between Sowlet and the Kawamis. It has been rumoured for some time that Nizam, at the instigation of Sow- let, is contemplating hostilities with Mullah Khurshid of Kamarii. Khurshid keeps his district m perfect order, has never rebelled against the Government pays his Mahyat regularly. It is therefore fitting that he should he harried by the Government which whimsically rewards rebellion and discourages loyalty. Of course, if Khurshid resists, Nizam acd Sowlet will have their work cut out to get into Kamanj. But resistance would brand the unfortunate Khurshid as a rebel. Sowlet is much disturbed by the reported resignation of his friend Ain-ed- IJowleh, and ° n Januar y 2 7th be telegraphed from BojSasiun to the Pars deputies that, if a new Minister were appointed every day, he would cease co-operating in the interests of order and retire to his tribe. On the same day Hap Muhammad Kerim Khan telegraphed to Sowlet that some “ Innelabian ' had been going for Haji Agka (Pars deputy and Sowlet’s paid supporter in the Mejhs), and that Sowlet should at once send a strong protest. It almost looks as if the see-saw at Tehran was again inclining towards the Kawamis. In view of the collapse of the northern postal service, the Assistant Super intendent of the Indo-European Telegraph Department is experimenting with a departmental kasid system. The trial telegraph ghulam leaves tomorrow with letters for Abadeh, whence they will be forwarded by ordinary post. I am, therefore, closing my weekly diary today instead of tomorrow. The Boir Ahmedi have captured the town of Behbehan and taken over the Arsenal, Government buildings, etc. Some reports state that they have completely sacked the town, others assert that they have behaved with com parative moderation. The Bushire road is still blocked by snow, neither cara- vansjjor posts passing. Mr. Knox cut his way though on foot, with a Persian ghulam of the Indo-European Telegraph Department from Mian Kotal to Khan- i-Ziniyan, where he arrived today. This feat, which must have entailed some danger and considerable endurance, has excited much admiring astonishment among the Shirazis.

On January 28th Nizam, following Sowlet s example (see last week’s News) telegraphed to Tehran that he would resign, if Am-e - Dowleh’s resignation were accepted. The retirement of Am-ed-Dowleh, he said would mean that the “ Chiefs of the South ” would withdraw their co operation, and disastrous results would ensue. The “ Chiefs of the South are of course only Sowlet, who undoubtedly dictated the above telegram to Nizam. This incident is not very flattering for Nizam s political^ prudence and seems to show that he is really merely Sowlet’s creature. His imprudent threat does not appear to have had much effect. He is unlikely to resign before he has got in his rents. Nizam is evidently apprehensive that intrigues are on foot at Tehran with a view to sacking him. Sowlet left Borasjun for his tribe on January 30th. Fatih* ul-Mulk with the Tehran army has reached Abadeh. The Karguzar has been olfered and has accepted his old post of C(m s yd“ General for India. This is a disaster of the first magnitude for the British Consulate at Shiraz. He is the best Persian official I have ever met. Irom some obscure telegrams, I rather suspect that Nizam had something to do with this appointment. Probably Sowlet, who hates Movagger-ed-Dowleh, persuaded Nizam to urge Tehran to remove the best of Karguzars. The'Behbehan force (see last week’s News) has been delayed by the snow hut reached Khan-i-Ziniyan today. It has two guns with it. It is reported from Kazeroun that Muhammad Ali Khan Kashkuli has had a fight with the Mamasenni robbers who perpetrated the robberies on the Bushire°road last November and December. He is said to have recovered 40 loads of loot but it is not clear from which lot. W. A. SMART. Shiraz : 3rd February 1911. Enclosure 4. No. 5, dated Shiraz, the 27th January 1911. Erom—W. A. Smart, Esq., To—His Majesty's Minister at Tehran. I venture Jb bring to your notice the question of the Shiraz garrison and the dangers involved in its increase. There are now about 2,300 infantry soldiers (sarbaz) in Shiraz. These soldiers are in tjafe state of pitiful destitution owing to the non-payment of their wages. To save themselves from starvation, they are compelled to beg, to steal, to cut down for firewood the trees around Shiraz, and, on one occasion, actually to plunder a whole quarter of the town. Their wood-cutting exploits have excited much alarm among the Shirazis, who view with despair the prospect of the fairest valley in Persia being denuded of the trees which constituted its chief beauty and are almost a necessity against the burning sun of a ^Shiraz summer. The local authorities have made feeble attempts to restrain the soldiers, but with 100 Cossacks and a few local sowars it is impossible to control 2,300 starving soldiers.The above is a moderate description of the position resulting from the S? £ f actual garrison at Shiraz. Moreover, it must be remeTbered ° f the pres , en * garrison has been to some extent mitigated by the fact that its command has been vested in Nasr-ed-Dowleh This impetuous young man has many faults, but his worst enemies cannot 'accuse him of lack of generosity In the early part of his administration he paid out of his own pocket not ess than 25,000 tomans to maintain the garrison entrusted to his care It is extremely unlikely that any other Commander-in- Chief will make similar sacrifices. 1 have frequency expressed my apprehensions on the subject to the local authorities and have suggested the advisability of dismissing a part of this use less, pernicious soldiery. They have always replied that the Central Govern ment wifi not sanction this measure. Kawa^ul-Mulk has often privately expressed to me the anxiety which the soldiery cause him, and onlv a week ago he told me that he had solemnly warned the Persian Government by telegraph that, unless the troops were paid or dismissed, serious disorders were not unlikely. I understand that the Persian Government are now sending to Shiraz a large force, the greater part consisting of the usual infantry regiments. I do not entirely share the view of those who maintain that the sarbaz are absolutely useless. A moderate number is, in my opinion,uCseful, if only to serve as a nucleus for expeditions, the mam strength of which must consist in sowars. The presence of sarbaz is sometimes invaluable to convince waverers among rebellious tribes, etc., that the expedition is really a Government undertaking • the sarbaz have thus often helped to form a large army on the snowball system. The sarbaz are often useful in the town against timid citizens who may at times give trouble. The present garrison, however, is more than sufficient for these purposes. I view with apprehension the prospect of further increases involving the presence of some four thousand sarbaz at Shiraz • Kawam-ul-Mulk, in reply to an enquiry from me, said that presumably the Persian Government would not send such a large force without arranging for its pay. I wish I could share this moderate optimism. Personally, I anticipate that the whole garison of 4,000 sarbaz will have to live in the usual hand-to- mouth manner, receiving occasional pittances on account of arrears of pay. It is not impossible that Mzam-es-Sultaneh, like so many of his predecessors, may, after a brief reign, disappear ingloriously from Pars. Some impotent Deputy Governor will be left in charge during a long interregnum with 4,000 hungry, unpaid sarbaz. Then it will be a matter for congratulation if the soldiery contents itself with merely plundering the Jewish quarter, . ^ ma y be said that the troops were just as badly paid in the past without serious results. According to the local authorities, however, the recent military reforms have modified very disadvantageously the position of the sarbaz. Formerly ^ e y received regularly rations in kind from the Government and their “ Xhanehvari ” from their villages. Their infinitesimal wages of a few tomans yearly were rarely paid. The new Government with its usual mania of putting the cart before the horse, has suppressed the rations and taken over the “ Khanehvari” for itself, fixing in return the soldier’s pay at one Kran a day. The villagers knowing that the “ Khanehvari ” would no longer go to their comrades serving with the colours and realising the importance of the Govern ment to collect it for the Treasury, have generally refrained altogether from paying this tax. The result is that the unfortunate soldier has nothing to live on except occasional doles on account of his arrears of pay. All Persians with whom I have discussed the matter have always agreed that it would be much better for the Persian Government to equip properly and pay regularly 1,000 efficient troops instead of wasting money on this large and useless garrison. The Persian Government may have reasons for per sisting in this curious policy of importing into Pars herds of inefficient, unpaid soldiers. 1 only wish to bring to your notice the danger which the accumula tion of this rabble in Shiraz may occasion, unless some satisfactory arrange ments are made for its more or less regular pay. You may, perhaps, think it advisable to warn the competent authorities at Tehran of the danger, so that, in the event of any future disaster, the Persian Government may not be able to plead that they were taken by surprise.India Office, London, 17th March 1911.

With reference to previous correspondence ending with your letter of 8th July, on the subject or the compensation to be claimed from the Persian Government for the death of two Indian sowars killed in the course of the attack on Mr. Bill, 1 am directed by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to transmit to you, for submission to the Earl of Crewe, the enclosed copy of a Despatch on the subject from His Majesty’s Minister at Teheran, No. 194, 29th October, from which it appears that the Persian Government, while declining to admit the principle of responsibility, might be willing to discuss in a friendly way the question of making a compassionate grant of 4,000 tomans to the families of the two sowars. I am directed by Sir E. Grey to enquire whether Lord Crewe considers that a compromise on these lines should be accepted. I am, &amp;c., The Under Secretary of State Louis Mallet. for India. Annex 1.

When sending me his note the Minister for Foreign Affairs intimated to me that the Persian Government, while declining to admit the principle of responsibility, would be prepared to discuss in a friendly way the question of a compassionate grant to the families of the two sowars, and he has since stated the sum of 4,000 tomans in all as the maximum that the Persian Government might be prepared to grant. I presume that we are precluded from accepting these terms, both because to do so would involve the waiving of an important principle, and also because we could hardly accept less than Russia has demanded in similar circumstances, but I have felt bound to submit Hussein Kuli Khan’s proposal as it seems to offer the only chance of obtaining any satisfaction at an early date. I should mention that the Persian Government though they have admitted their liability in the case of the attack on Mi. Passek have persistently refused to pay the compensation demanded of them, though I understand that the Russian Legation have managed to recover 5 000 tomans by writing it off against money owed to the Persian Government by the Legation.

Note from the Persian Government, dated 13th October 1910. In reply to Your Excellency’s note of 23rd September last respecting the murder of two Indian sowars between Shiraz and Isfahan, mve the honour to state that according to reports received from the Govern o of Abadeh, when Mr. Bill was starting from that place, he had especially told him that, owing to the unrest amongst the tribes he should postpone his journey for a day so that he may prepare lor him a sufficient number of guards, but Mr. Bill did not agree, and even refused to put his journey off for two hours enabling the Governor to prepare a sufficient number of guards. The latter, however, sent with him 80 road guards who were ready on the spot, and they got safely to Shulgistan. T next day, when there was every possibility of fresh disorders on that portion of the road, Mr. Bill, without giving information to the local authorities, finding out the condition of the road, and asking for guaids, returns to Abadeh. , , , In view of the above facts, Your Excellency will admit that the local authorities had not failed in their duties, and that the incident had been the result of Mr. Bill’s carelessness and haste. Ihe Governor had urged him to postpone his journey and wait for guards because he was anticipating such incidents. While expressing my deepest regret for this incident, I have now the honour to point out to h our Excellency that Mr. Bill’s haste and refusal to take notice of the local Governors earnest pressure had led to this incident, and have entirely removed the responsibility of the local Governor. 1 avail, &lt;xc., Hussein Kuu. Annex 3. Note to the Persian Government, dated Tehran, 18th October 1910. I am in receipt of Your Excellency’s note of the 13th instant with respect to the attack on Mr. Bill and the killing of two Indian sowais on the Shiraz-Isfahan road on 15th April last, in which you endeavour to exonerate the Deputy Governor of Abadeh of all icsponsibilit} foi this incident, on the ground that he endeavoured to induce Mi\ Bill _ to postpone his departure for a day or two in order that he should provide a sufficient number of guards to ensure his safety. Mr. Bill, in reporting the circumstances to His Majesty’s Legation, stated that the Deputy Governor had not the slightest idea how to procure the proposed reinforcements, and it ’would have been imprac ticable for Mr. Bill to remain indefinitely at Abadeh. Moreover^ Mr. Bill was actually accompanied from Abadeh by 12 local “ sowars,” 25 local “ tufangchis,” and three extra Persian cossacks, in addition to his own escort, consisting of 13 Indian “ sowars ” and four Persian cossacks. It will, therefore be seen that Mr. Bill’s escort consisted of 57 armed men. I am, however, in no way concerned as to the question whether or not the Deputy Governor was responsible. The fact remains that one of His Majesty's Consular Officers, while travelling on the high road in Persia, was attacked and two of his consular escort killed. The Persian Government is obviously responsible for the security of its roads, and I must request that reparation for this outrage on a British Consular Officer and the killing of two of his escort may no longer be delayed. I avail, &amp;c., His Excellency, G. Barclay. Hussein Kuli Khan.Sir Enclosure No. 2. India Office to Foreign Office. India Office, l am directed by the Secretary of State for India to acknowledge the receipt of your letter ho. 42,252, of 25th November, regarding the refusal of the Persian Government to accept liability for the death of two sowars ol Mr. Bill’s escort in an affray with robbers in April last In reply I am to say that it appears to the Earl of Crewe that it will be yeiy difficult to extract from the Persian Government, an admission of the point of principle, and that such an admission would be of little pi actical \alue, if extracted. Moreover, it may be remembered that Mi. Bill was not a Consular Officer travelling in the discharge of his duties, but a private individual travelling for pleasure; and though that fact does not lessen the responsibility of the Persian Government for his safety, it enables His Majesty’s Government to take a less serious view of the outrage without sacrifice of prestige. In these circumstances the Secretary of State for India would prefer to regard the Persian Govern ment’s offer as in itself a sufficient acceptance of their responsibility, provided that they express their regret for the incident, and that the money is immediately paid. If, howevei, neither condition is likely to be fulfilled, Lord Crewe would suggest that the Persian Government should be informed that His Majesty’s Government must continue to hold them fully responsible, and that they cannot abate their claim for compensation. And it might be added that the mere fact that a gentleman of Mr. Bill’s position, with an escort of 12 Indian cavalry and four Persian cossacks, cannot travel in safety on one of the main roads, and that the Persian Government disclaim responsibility, sufficiently justifies His Majesty’s Government in the demand they have recently made for the restoration of order, and in insisting rigorously on its satisfaction.

To this he demurred urging that the amount ought to depend on the size of the families of the murdered men. . I cannot therefore say that Hussein Kuli Khan was committed to any precise sum, and when I broached the matter to his successor, Mohtashem es Saltaneh, the latter adhered to the figure of tomans 2,000. After some discussion I agreed to accept the sum of tomans 3,000, if paid within a week. As you aware the late Minister for Foreign Affairs expressed his deepest regret for the occurrence in his Note of 13th October last. I ought to mention that since I agreed on a settlement on the basis of tomans 3,000 the Russian Minister has received in full the payment of his claim on account of the attack on Monsieur Passek. The two cases are, however, not altogether on all fours, and the Persian Government had admitted its liability in the case of the attack on Monsieur Passek, whereas it has always refused to do so in the case of the attack on Mr. Bill.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 221 of the 30th ultimo, I have the honour to transmit a memorandum compiled by Major Stokes from despatches and telegrams from His Majesty’s acting consul at Shiraz on the negotiations between the Persian Government and Soulet-ed-Dowleh for the opening of the main route from Bushire to Shiraz, and on the state of this road and of the road from Shiraz to Ispahan during the past few weeks. It will be seen that since Soulet announced that the main Bushire-Shiraz route was opened his measures for its protection have not sufficed to prevent robberies or to secure the recovery of the stolen property, and that certain British traders hesitate to use the road pending assurances from me that the Persian Government will be held responsible for losses, assurances which, in the face of the official notification of last spring as to the opening of the Jirreh road, I do not see my way to give until I can obtain from the Persian Government an official announcement that the main route is now open. So far I have not been able to extract this announcement. Nevertheless it will be noticed that caravans are passing along this road and also along the road from Shiraz to Ispahan, and no robberies have been reported from any part of the road since the 5th December. This improvement is due, no doubt, more to the cold weather than to the measures taken for the security of the road, and Colonel Cox, in a despatch copy of which I enclose, gives reasons for thinking that Soulet-ed-Dowleh’s co-operation with the Persian Government for the protection of the main Bushire-Shiraz route will not be of long duration. But, however Soulet-ed-Dowleh’s attitude may develop, Nizam-es- Sultaneh, the new Governor-General of Pars, if the Persian Government perseveres in its efforts to support him with troops and obtains the means of doing so by accepting the Imperial Bank of Persia’s loan, should before the end of the winter have behind him a force which should give him a fair chance of coping with the situation without Soulet-ed-Dowleh’s aid. In any case I think that while immunity from robberies on the Bushire-Ispahan road, which has now lasted for three weeks, continues it would hardly be desirable that we should begin to insist on the acceptance of our scheme for the policing of the road. I have been totally unable to induce the Minister for Foreign Affairs to entertain the idea of spontaneously applying for our officers. He no doubt realises that British Indian officers are specially suited to the work we propose should be entrusted to them, but the apprehension that their engagement would provoke a demand from Russia for analogous arrangements on some of the northern roads is so general that a proposal for an application in the sense desired could have no chance of passing the Medjliss, nor do I think that the Persian Government could be induced to accept our scheme by the ordinary methods of diplomatic pressure. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Memorandum by Major Stokes. EARLY in November Soulet-ed-Dowleh arrived at Kazeroun at the request of the Minister of the Interior, and negotiations by telegraph were immediately begun with him for the opening up of the Kazeroun road to Bushire. While the negotiations were proceeding, on the 14th November a very serious robbery by Boir Ahmadis (100 on loot and 10 mounted) took place at Ak-Chashmeh, the point at which the Kazeroun [1845 /—3]and Firuzabad roads meet, some 12 miles from Shiraz. Over 100 mules and 100 loads were carried off, half the plundered goods being the property of British merchants. This robbery, occurring when it did, could only be harmful to Soulet-ed-Dowleh s interests. From this fact it is to be inferred that the Boir Ahmadi, instigated m th^^ past to plunder caravans in Soulet-ed-Dowleh’s interests, are now continuing to plunder to his detriment. In reply to telegrams from His Majesty s acting consul and from the Shiraz merchants he stated that he had sent a force to recover the goods. So far none of the stolen property has been restored. Meanwhile negotiations for the opening of the Kazeroun road continued. Soulet- ed-Dowleh was most reluctant to open the road because of the pecuniary loss entailed to him by the closing of the Jirreh road, and because once the Kazeroun road is opened the central Government can gradually take over the policing of it themselves. If they do this, he loses control of the main trade route, which is the chief cause of his power. On the oilier hand, as his representatives at Tehran pointed out to him, the Persian Government must, in view of the British note of the 14th October, open the Kazeroun road, and if, therefore, he would not agree to do it, they would be compelled to use force against him. Soulet-ed-Dowleh, well aware of his inability to hold his own if force were used against him, agreed to open the road. The Government on their part undertook to pay for any number of guards he might find necessary to keep the road open. In addition, he was promised the support of the Government and, it is said, the governorships of Kamarij and Mamasenni. The Kazeroun road was accordingly opened, and of 400 guards, for which it was arranged the Government should pay, 200 were placed on the section Kazeroun- Shiraz. Relying on Soulet-ed-Douleh’s declaration that the road was safe, over 3,000 mules left Shiraz for Bushire during the last week of November. On the 27th November a strong force of robbers, said to be the Boir Ahmadis and Kashgais, attacked these caravans at Pul-i-Karakach and carried off 184 loads, 260 animals, and two pilgrims (women). There were no British goods in these caravans. This robbery caused a panic among the merchants in Shiraz, and did much harm to Soulet-ed-Dowleh’s renascent popularity. It has been variously suggested that this robbery was due to— 1 . Soulet-ed-Dowleh’s desire to force the traffic back to the Jirreh road, or to compel the Government to give him more governorships and an increased allowance for guards. 2. His maintaining an inadequate number of guards, and pocketing the allowance for guards. 3. To his having lost control of his tribes, the robbery being the work of those of his own tribe who are opposed to him. In any case the responsibility lies with Soulet-ed-Dowleh. Towards the end of November there was some lighting amongst the Kashgais near Kazeroun as a result of Soulet-ed-Dowleh’s attempts to chastise the Farsismadan tribe, which was apparently chiefly responsible for the damage done to the telegraph lines last October. Some twenty men were killed on both sides. A third robbery occurred on the 5th December some 40 miles from Shiraz, when a caravan accompanied by troops was attacked by a mixed band of Kashgais and Lurs. No details are to hand of the extent of the robbery. What seems clear is that the widespread disaffection against him in his own tribe is making the task of safeguarding the Kazeroun road a difficult one for Soulet-ed-Dowleh. He has so far failed either to afford effective protection to caravans or to recover plundered goods. Caravans on the main route are, however, reaching Bushire in safety, and the majority of the local merchants are dispatching goods, though certain British firms hesitate to do so pending assurances from His Majesty’s Legation that the Persian Government will be held responsible for losses. The first results of the British note of the 14th October were to make Soulet-ed- Dowleh for the moment supreme, and to force him to open the Kazeroun road. Three months were all too short a time for the Persian Government to get a new Governor- General to Shiraz and to open the road themselves. Consequently they had to offer Soulet-ed-Dowleh the choice between opening the road and being treated as a rebel. He chose the former. The Shiraz-Ispahan road is being used by caravans with safety. This safety is to be attributed in great measure to the arrival of winter, and failing the presence of astrong governor with troops, the spring, when the tribes more be a period of danger. begin to migrate, will once C.

With reference to the doubt expressed by me in paragraph 3 of my last com munication as to whether the central Government would attempt to pacify Fars and restore secuiity for caravan traffic by the suppression of the Soulet-ed-Dowleh, Kashgai, or through his instrumentality, it will be seen from the first entry in Mr. Smart’s news sheet for the week ending the 12 th November that the trend of probabilities seems to be m the direction of the latter alternative, and the news entry derives corroboration here from a telegram leceived by certain Persian merchants from their Shiraz agents to the effect that the task of providing security for caravans on the Kazeroun route has been, or is to be, entrusted to the Soulet. 3. In view of the above information, I think we are warranted in assuming for the moment that the means which the central Government intend to emplov—I may say are driven by force of circumstances to employ—in order to effect a degree of security on the Bushire-Ispahan route sufficient to satisfy the demands of the British note will be the delegation of the task to the Kashgai Ilkhani. • The primary object of our ultimatum is no doubt to ensure that something specific shall be done to save our commerce entering Southern Persia by Bushire and Bunder Abbas from complete annihilation, and I have before expressed the view that we had best leave the central Government to make the foriorn attempt in their own way and not be identified with their probable failure, but now that it is tolerably clear how they propose to set about it we may advisedly consider the outlook from the point of view provided. The necessities of our commerce may indeed be met for a time, for it will probably suit the Soulet’s personal aims to maintain security, also for a time, on the Kazeroun route—the only route of which we should take cognisance—but it will remain secure not at the will of the central Government, but at the independent pleasure or caprice of the Kashgai chief. It is thus the more unfortunate that the Soulet’s own financial interests are altogether inconsistent with a permanent reversion to the Kazeroun route, and lie in the use of the Firozabad or Jirreh alternatives, since the latter, passing through his personal estates and the sphere of Kashgai migration, afford him and his 1910* ShiraZ new8 ’ November 5; ditt0 ’ November 12; Minister to Consul, Shiraz, Telegraphic, November 23,4 -c -rvioVi-nrr n Ifirp'p iiicoinG out of passing traffic, by tllG tribesmen every opportunity for ^ uit t rates 0 f tbeir own fixing.

YYI1H refei ence to my telegram No. 513 of the 29th instant, I have the honour to transmit herewith a translation of the note which the Persian Government have addressed in reply to my note of the 17th ultimo respecting the insecurity on the southern roads. v J * / I shall have the honour to send you by telegraph before this despatch reaches you such comments as I desire to make on the document in question. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. Enclosure in No. 1 . Vazir Zadeh to Sir G. Barclay. (Translation.) Your Excellency, Tehran, 25 Zilhejjeh, 1328 {December 26, 1910). IN reply to your answering note of the 17th November, I have the honour to say regarding your idea that the effects of the stay of foreign troops on Persian soil are not r£ygllQ»t, that as your sense of the importance of things will testify, there can be no doubt that the presence of foreign troops in the interior of a country naturally engages the attention of the Government and causes its prestige to suffer, and for this cause the good intentions of the Government for complete good order as desirable are unproductive of result, but as this matter was fully dealt with in my note of the 21st October, I do not think it necessary to repeat myself on this occasion. Regarding communications between Bushire and Shiraz to which you referred, your Excellency is not unaware that the Persian Government, which has always borne in mind the necessity to uphold commercial relations, has appointed Sowlet-ed-Dowleh to maintain order on the Bushire-Shiraz road. Besides this, the Persian Government have taken preliminary steps for the further maintenance of order, which I now communicate to your Excellency :— 1. A competent governor-general, with necessary instructions, has been appointed and sent to Ears, and will shortly arrive at his post. After his arrival he will take fundamental measures for the completion of entire order in those parts. 2 . The responsibility for the protection of security on the Kazeroun road has been entrusted to Sowlet-ed-Dowleh. At present he has placed 380 mounted and unmounted guards on that road, and they are patrolling it, and according to reliable reports the Kazeroun road is in perfect security. 3. A force composed of mounted and unmounted men as well as artillery is being sent; of these 700 men and three guns sent from Tehran have passed Kum, two regiments from Hamadan, and the Jelali regiment will join the force at Ispahan. This force is over and above the garrison at present in Ears. 4. A considerable sum out of the loan which is about to be concluded will be laid aside for the perfection of security, and the Government is engaged in elaborating a system by which the expenditure necessary for this purpose will be properly laid down and its control properly carried out. 5. Besides the appointment to Ears of one of the European military officers serving under the Persian Government, very shortly a number of men will be employed and will arrive from abroad for the prompt organisation of the gendarmerie. I have no doubt whatever that in view of these measures the project of the Persian Government for the perfection of order will be fully carried out, and that your Excellency’s anxieties will be dispelled.

M. le Mimstre, Tehran, November 17, 1910. 1 DAVE the honour to acknowledge your Excellency’s note of the 21st ultimo . ,, In re P I y m S ‘his communication I do not deal with your Excellency’s references o the presence of foreign troops in Persia, as I consider these references Jbe irrelevan to the matter with which I am now specially concerned, viz., the outrages and depredations of tribesmen on the southern trade routes. 1909 ZT^'r^r 1148 t0 th j in . c [ ea , se m the total volume of Persian trade for v n 1 ° ( - lakh 1 a gh o ; nl ) as compared with the year 1908-9, and to the further increase which has marked the first five months of the current year, but I must point out that tortenTof ob ® ervakle ™ 1909-10 applied, as can be seen from the customs returns, to the north and not to the south. In particular it will be seen that the Bushire customs receipts for las year were much lower than 1908-9, just as in 1908-9 they were much lower than m the preceding year. J in + fi S rega Y^ s t ^ ie i ncrea se during the first five months of the current year it is true mat ^the southern customs share in this increase, but it should be remembered that this years harvest has been exceptionally abundant, and that the first five months of last year with which comparison is made included the period during which Bushire was in the power oi Seyyid Murteza and his tangistanis, and I would draw your Excellency s attention to the fact that notwithstanding this the Bushire receipts only show an increase of some 12 per cent. y } But whatever may be the statistics of trade for the past months, it cannot be denied that certain of the southern roads are practically impassable. This especially refers to the mam southern trade route connecting Bushire with Ispahan, the district on the confines of the provinces of Ears and Ispahan being in a state of indescribable disorder, and though traffic between Bushire and Shiraz has not latterly been entirely stopped, it has only been able to pass by an inconvenient and circuitous route where merchandise is subjected to extortionate and illegal fees, and only by the sufferance o a tribal chief^ who is not under full control of the Government. There can, indeed, be no hope of any lasting revival of trade so long as the present anarchy continues on these southern roads, and it was with a view to securing for this deplorable state of things a remedy to be applied if possible by the Persian Government, but if necessary with the assistance of British officers lent from the Indian armv to the Persian Government, that I have addressed your Excellency on the subject. It could not be^ contended that the above measures would constitute any infringement of the sovereign rights of Persia, as the officers lent from the Indian army would take service under the Persian Government. [1805 t-2 A rp^ards the 10 per cent, surcharge on the import duties on goods passing through hf southern customs, I am to state that His Majesty s Government can only agree to this charge on condition that the proceeds are spent effectively on securing the safety of the southern trade routes.

An anonymous circular was widely distributed, calling on all true patriots to meet on the 17th November in the Artillery Square to demonstrate against the continued presence of Russian troops, and against the British note respecting the condition of the South. At the appointed time a few hundred persons having assembled, the principal mujtehed declared the proceedings opened, and several speakers proceeded to address the audience on the subject of Persia’s alleged wrongs. The action of England and Russia was characterised by the various speakers as directed towards the termination of Persia’s independence, and the convic tion was expressed that the attitude adopted by His Majesty’s Government towards this country by no means affected the sympathetic feelings of the British nation towards Persia.^ The meeting, however, did not evoke much patriotic enthusiasm among the somewhat indifferent gathering, and though the local press has endeavoured to make much of it as a great popular demonstration, it seems to have been a complete failure. There seems little doubt that the whole thing was organised by the local journalistic leaders, perhaps encouraged by the militant Nationalist element in the Assembly, as they have been extremely noisy of late in their attacks on Russia and England, especially since the publication of my note of the 14th October, respecting the southern roads. The suggestions which have been made, not only in the German press but in such papers as the “ Daily News,” the “ Daily Graphic,” and the “ Manchester Guardian,” as to the recent note being the forerunner of the partition of Persia by Great Britain and Russia have not fallen unheeded in this country. The articles have been trans lated and published in full, while the comments thereon have, in some cases, been even more exaggerated than those which appeared in the English papers above-mentioned. As a natural corollary to the anti-British and anti-Russian clamour now prevailing, the local press contains frequent references to the possibility of inducing Germany, by the grant of concessions or other means, to take a greater interest in Persia. An open letter has also appeared in the local press from the chief priests of Nejef to the foreign representatives at Tehran, in which a fervent appeal is made to justice and honour against the supposed aggressive aims of Great Britain and Russia. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY, P.S. November 23.—Since I wrote the above, my note of the 17th instant has been communicated by the Minister of Foreign Affairs to the press, which has been quick to notice its milder tone, which it ascribes to His Majesty’s Government being obliged, owing to the unanswerable considerations urged in the note from the Persian Government, to realise its error and abate its severity.

Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received December 19.) (No. 221.) ' ^ Tehran, November 30, 1910. SINCE my note of the 14th October regarding the disorders on the southern trade routes was presented there has been every indication that the Persian Govern ment at length realise the necessity of opening the main southern road. The first essential steps to this end—the appointment of a really competent Governor-General of Ears and of one who can be induced to take up the post—has already been taken. At first, as you are aware, it was proposed to bring the Zil-es- Sultan back to Persia to fill this post. Indeed, the Cabinet telegraphed on the 3rd instant offering His Imperial Highness the appointment, which it was known he was prepared to accept. But Sardar Assad, when he heard of this step, used such forcible language to the Prime Minister regarding the proposed appointment that the latter induced Jellal-ed-Dowleh, the Zibs son, to telegraph to his father advising him not to accept it. It is unfortunate, in view of the Zil’s great prestige in Ears, that Sardar Assad could not sink his personal animosity, but the Persian Government have now, I think, made as good a choice as was possible under the circumstances. They have appointed Nizam-es-Sultaneh, who has recently done good work as Governor of Kermanshah. He has extensive property between Bushire and Shiraz, and some [ influence in the province of Ears. His Majesty’s consul at Kermanshah reports that he is on the point of leaving for his new post, and will travel via Bushire. But without the backing of a strong force there can be little hope that even an efficient Governor will be able to deal with the situation. The Minister of War has undertaken to dispatch a force of between 2,000 and 3,000 men to Shiraz, and now that the Persian Government seem about to accept the offer of financial assistance from the Imperial Bank there seems a good prospect of Nizam-es-Sultaneh’s receiving the promised support. Meanwhile, it is announced that Sowlet-ed-Dowleh has guaranteed the safety of the main route from Bushire to Shiraz. Unfortunately, the value of this guarantee is largely discounted by the news which reaches me at the moment of writing that the first caravan to abandon the circuitous routes recently followed and to trust to Sowlet’s guarantee has been looted between Shiraz and Kazeroun.

As you will notice, Mr. Smart’s recommendations are based on the assumption that my note of the 14th October regarding the southern roads accurately described the intentions of His Majesty’s Government in regard to the policing of the Bashire-Ispahan road—a misapprehension which I have since corrected. But though Mr. Smart s despatch was written under a misapprehension, I venture to forward it, as it contains an interesting exposition of the present situation in Bars, from the pen of one who believes that the best course for the Persian Government would be to remove Soulet-ed-Dowleh from his position as Ilkhani of the Kashgais, a view which, though held by Sardar Assad, is not shared by the Persian Government. I have informed Mr. Smart, in reply to this despatch, that in the circumstances I do not propose to interfere in the Persian Government’s relations with Soulet. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. Enclosure in No. 1. Acting Consul Smart to Sir G. Barclay. (No. 45.) ^ Shiraz, October 25, 1910. WITH reference to my despatch No. 34 of the 25th July last and previous correspondence regarding our attitude in the question of Soulet-ed-Dowleh, I venture to suggest, for the consideration of yourself and Colonel Cox, that the moment has now come when we can, with advantage, depart from our policy of neutrality in Ears politics. I understand from your telegram No. 72 of the 15th instant that His Majesty’s Government are now prepared to take effective measures to ensure a reasonable amount of security on the telegraph route from Bush ire to Ispahan, should the Persian Govern ment fail to restore order along that route within three months. That being the case, the main reason, as far as the interior of Ears is concerned, for our refraining from throwing our moral influence openly into the scale against Soulet-ed-Dowleh would seem no longer to exist. I have hitherto deprecated our declaring ourselves openly against him for the obvious reason that, if, after we had done so, the Persian Government had not suppressed him, our position in Ears would have been extremely awkward, even dangerous. If, however, we are ready, in case of necessity, to take adequate measures to ensure security along the the highway of our trade for rhe conveyance of our merchandise, for the passage of our travellers, and for the employes and wires of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, we can, it would seem, view with equanimity the hostility of Soulet-ed-Dowleh, as far as the interior of Ears is concerned. I have long ago expressed my opinion that the suppression of Soulet-ed-Dowleh is imperative for the restoration of order in Ears. Time has only strengthened me in this belief, and I venture now to offer a few observations on the general situation, with a view to emphasising the incompatibility of order in Ears generally, and on the Bushire- Ispahan telegraph route particularly, with the maintenance of Soulet-ed-Dowleh. The root of the evil in Ears is the enmity existing between the Kawamis and the Ilkhani of the Kashgais. It is this enmity which has caused both parties to incite their respective followers to create disturbances at different times and at different places, with the object of damaging each others position. Having once ordered their tribesmen to plunder for particular objects, it became very difficult to prevent them from plundering indiscriminately. Hence the present situation with the tribes no longer under the control of their chiefs, who, from fear of each other, dared not take energetic measures to chastise their rebellious followers. The interests of the two parties are so conflicting [1805 *—3] B 3o' I that a practical reconciliation is, I fear, now impossible. Last May by reducing Soulef ed-Dowleh to a position of absolute subordinacy, -and by assuring the Kawamis tha the Government was on their side, it might have been possible to retain and compel both parties to co-operate with the Government for the restoration of order. however, the conflict between the interests of the two part.es has been so much^ aggravated that it can only be satisfactorily settled by the suppression of one or the If this vital problem of the strife between the Kawamis and the Ilkhani of the Kashgais is solved in a sense favourable to the authority of the Government the question of the Kuhgelus and the many other turbulent marauders can be settled without considerable difficulty. . • i • As you are aware, I came to Ears strongly prejudiced against Kawamis and in favour of Soulet-ed-Dowleh. Local study of the situation, however, convinced me that the views I had brought with me from Tehran were erroneous. I came to the conclusion that the interests of Soulet-ed-Dowleh were directly opposed to the re-establishment ol the Government’s authority in Fars, and that the inteiests o t e awamis, on t e contrary were at present identical with those of the Government, the Kawamis are townsmen, and the authority they exercised oyer the Khamseh tribes was m the nature of a governorship rather than of a chieftainship. Indeed, the official title of the head of the Khamseh tribes is “hakim” (governor), not “ ilkham’ (chief of tribe), as m the case of the head of the Kashgais. The authority of the Kawamis over their tribes, therefore, generally increased or declined with the strength or weakness ot the Government. The position of the Soulet-ed-Dowleh is quite the reverse. He is a tribesman, and his power increases with the weakness of the Government and declines , with its strength. The above explanations will perhaps suffice to show why the Kawamis must be in favour of, and Soulet must object to, a strong Government in Fars. In other words, disorders in Fars suit the latter, and are very detrimental to the former. _ . . Turning from these general considerations to the particular question of the secunty of the Bushire-Ispahan telegraph route, it is again evident that the interests of boulet- ed-Dowleh are directly opposed to the restoration of order on that road. His net revenues from tolls levied on caravans, and from the difference between the amount realised by the sale of his cereals under normal conditions, ynd the increased amount realised by their advantageous sale on the spot to muleteers using the Firuzabad, Jirreh, and Sarhad routes during the year cannot be less than 100,000 tomans annually. Ihis sum represents his net prohts ; the guards are not paid by him, but collect their perquisites separately from the muleteers. It would require a very wise man to forgo, without compulsion, this large revenue in the interests of general order and the develop ment of trade. Soulet-ed-Dowleh has shown that he is not such a man, and the present state of the telegraph route from Bushire to Shirez, and from Abadeh to Aminabad, is directly due to him ; in fact, it is probable that some of the disorder prevailing on the telegraph route between Shiraz and Abadeh may be traced to his instigation. In short, it is to Soulet-ed-Dowleh’s interest that the telegraph route from Bushire to Shiraz should be always unsafe, and that the telegraph route from Shiraz to Ispahan should be unsafe during the summer months, in order that caravans should bo forced to use the Firuzabad, Jirreh, and Sarhad routes according to the season. For instance, the attack on Mr. Passek was almost certainly instigated by Soulet-ed-Dowleh for the achievement of the above objects. It is now necessary to consider the chances of a restoration of order in Jars by the Persian Government with reference to the question of Soulet ed-Dowleh. I came to Shiraz last March, believing that the situation in Fars was practically desperate. Local study of the situation convinced me that this was not yet the case. I saw that there were in Fars various elements which could be successfully utilised by a strong, astute governor-general for the restoration of order. In appreciation of local situations in Persia, we are perhaps apt to overlook the inherent divisions which disunite the elements of disorder and often enable a weak Government to re-assert its authority. The hosts of Kashgai sowars, the bands of hardy Boir Ahmedi riflemen, the many thousands of other armed and rebellious tribesmen—all these are frequently cited to demonstrate the impossibility of order being re-established by a Government which possesses no efficient army. These conditions, however, have existed for years and years; the only new factor is the debilitation of the Government owing to its financial difficulties and the blow struck at authority by a revolutionary movement. In other words, the Government is much weaker than formerly, but the divisions among the elements opposed to it are as acute as ever. It w T as mainly this fact which made methink last April that the situation still admitted of a native settlement. I venture to think that subsequent events justified my qualified optimism. By the end of May the situation had suddenly changed for the better, and the Government were in a winning position. ^ Unfortunately, the removal of Sardar Assad from the Ministry of the Interior at the critical moment; the reversal, mainly owing to reasons unconnected with Fars, by Sipahdar of his predecessor’s wise policy, and the incredible incompetence of Zafar- es-Sultaneh, not only wantonly lost the Government all the ground they had gained, but so increased the strength and audacity of the elements opposed to the Government, so weakened and disoigamsed the elements available for support of the Government, so discredited the already waning authority of the Government, that the situation has now become almost desperate. Last May it would have been quite easy to overthrow Soulet-ed-Dowleh ; it will now be much more difficult. Last May, after overthrowing Soulet-ed-Dowleh, the Government could have brought about a general restoration of order in Fars without great difficulty. Now, even if Soulet-ed-Dowleh be overthrown, the Government will experience considerable trouble in bringing about a general restoration of order, for the reason that the Kashgais are no longer under the control of their chiefs, and the little authority still possessed last May over the Khamseh tribes by the Kfawamis, has been almost destroyed. Nevertheless, although I fear I am almost alone among Europeans to hold this belief, I still think that, in spite of the weakness of the Government and the aggravation of the situation during the last six months of suicidal madness, there is just a chance of a native settlement. That settlement, however, can, in my opinion, only be satisfactorily effected by the overthrow of Soulet-ed-Dowleh. I can think of no combination or combinations by which the Persian Government could now retain Soulet-ed-Dowleh and yet bring about a general restoration of order in Fars as an integrant part of the Persian Empire. Even if the Persian Government, in desperation, decided to hand over Fars altogether to the tender mercies of this Turkish nomad and content itself with a vague suzerainty over the province, which is the home of the Persian race and language, I doubt whether Soulet-ed-Dowleh, even if he had the wisdom to rest satisfied with this local domination, which is more than doubtful, could restore order and govern Fars beneficially. The chiefs of the Kashgais are very ignorant men ; they have not even the veneer of civilisation and statecraft which has enabled some of the Bakhtiari khans to occupy important administrative, posts without discredit. Of course, ignorant tribesmen in Persia have in the past often shown themselves capable even of founding empires, but Soulet is certainly not such a man. He has disappointed his staunchest partisans ; although he started with the majority of the population of Shiraz on his side, he has now not a single respectable friend in the town, i Perhaps his youth and the novelty of his grandeur are responsible to some extent for his lack of wisdom and statesmanship. Experience might improve him, but I doubt it. He is, on the admission of his own partisans, avaricious, devoid of the power of attraction, deficient in courage and enterprise. Lacking all the qualities of a ruler of men, he is not, I think, capable of prudently protecting his interests in co-operation with the Government or of plaving satisfactorily the part of a semi-independent potentate in Fars. He had not the wisdom to co-operate with Saham-ed-Dowleh, whose enlightened administration he wrecked by stirring up disorders. Zafar-es-Sultaneh gave him more than he asked for, supported him consistently, and the result is the present aggravated situation. It is impo-sible to have any conhdence in his promises. In return for our valuable support at the critical moment in the summer of 1909 he assured Mr. Bill that Ala-ed-Dowleh was the only governor he objected to, and that he would co-operate with “ any dog ” who might be named in the place of Ala-ed- Dowleh. Last May, under the influence of fear, he promised, in return for the governorships of Abadeh. Kazeroun, Dashti, and Dashtistan, with an annual reduction of 1*2,000 tomans in his maliyat, to open up the Kazeroun road. Subsequent events tell their own story, and I need not insist further on the untrustworthiness ot Soulet-ed-Dowleh. In my opinion, he has been weighed in the balance and found wanting ; the sooner he goes, the better for Fars. ^ . ' Taking it for granted that the suppression of Soulet-ed-Dowleh is a si/ie qua non for the restoration of order in Fars by the Persian Government, we have now to considei the chances of success in an attempt to overthrow him.^ Soulet s power has been largely built up by bluff and the exaggerated respect paid to him by the ignorant central Government. The Kashgais are more influenced by the attitude of thei Government towards their chief than most tribes in Persia. Unfortunately the Persian uuwditxa i, - j +hiq advantage. It is perhaps not Government have never recognised or uti pintF hnt it is remarkable that surprising that Tehran should have been dece.ved by his bluff but t is ^markable that neonle in Shiraz should so long have taken it seriously. Last April 1 hard y _ y one whether Persian or European, who did not believe implicitly in the invincibility of Souiet I Of course except the Kawamis, whose views on this subject, being prejudiced, could not te taken into much account. Zaigam’s appearance on the scene showed that the feet of the colossus were made of clay and now no one believes m the -mcibtoy of Sonlet though his position is now much stronger than in last April, btill, c,oulet, mainly 1; bluff has created a special position for himself, and his overthrow is a delicate matter ' Y He can only be overthrown by using his three b ™ tlier * to seduce a al g e portion of the Kashgais from their allegiance to him. Last May these three brothels had for certain on their side, among the larger Kashgai tribes, all the Shishbulou s, ad the Darashoolis and three quarters of the Kashkoohs. A large part of the Kas gais wouU have taken no part at all in the struggle, and accepted with indifference the victor as Ilkhani. Soulet-ed-Dowleh could then have hardly relied on the support of more than miscellaneous bands from various tribes, which would only have stuck to jnm as long he paid them heavily. Unfortunately, the Persian Government missed their chance 8 andwe can now only take stock of their losses. The heaviest loss ,s undoubtedly the Shisbuloukis, the most powerful and homogeneous of the Kashgai tubes. Half this tribe will now undoubtedly fight t 2 Souiet, who, after the defection of then chief Ahmed Khan to Zaigam, appointed as chief one Bagher Beg and thus bound to hs cause, by self-interest, half the Shishbulookis. As the triumph of Zaigam-ed-Dowleh would involve the reinstatement of his father-in-law, Ahmed Khan, Bagher Beg and his partisans are bound to support Soulet vigorously. # With regard to the other tribes, I have no certain proofs to go on, and cannot give any details. Warned by the example of last May, the khans are unlikely to betray their sympathies until the Government is actually in the field against boulet, UndoubtedIv, many, who last May would have fought for Zaigam, will now either fight for Souiet or‘'remain neutral. Still, even now, the Government, if they ant with energy and skill, can assuredly count on considerable defections from Souiet. I he Kashgais are a rich, commercial, and agricultural tribe, and their khans, who are always ready for freebooting expeditions, are not at all partial to an open and sustained rebellion against the Government. They all have rich properties and other valuable wordly possessions. They are distrustful one of another and fear that by rebellion they may give their fellow-khans the chance of despoiling them with the help of the Government. I do not think they have any decided political ambitions ; the idea that, jealous of the Bakhtiari success, they were anxious to emulate their rivals and play an important part outside of their own restricted held in bars, has, I think, been much exaggerated. They are very happy in Lars, laying up riches by trading and robbing, and could probably only be incited to wider action, and then only fitfully, by heavy pecuniary considerations. Soulet’s wealth, of course, gives him a great advantage in preserving the loyalty of ',the Kashgais. However, his avarice and hardness have made him personally unpopular with his tribesmen, and he is deficient m courage and enterprise. On the other hand, Zaigam, although apparently rather unsteady, has the reputation of a dashing leader. In the fighting three years ago for the chieftainship, Zaigam compared very favourably with Souiet, and his resolution last May created a great impression. While, of course, it is impossible to express a certain opinion, I think that, if the Persian Government officially proclaim Soulet’s dismissal and Zaigam’s appointment at the first opportune moment, and then act with vigour and skill, they could still win away from Souiet a large enough portion of the tribe to give a fair chance of success. # If Souiet were overthrown, the task of the Government would be much simplified. The numerous bandits, who, at Soulet’s instigation or with his connivance, have been pillaging everywhere, from the powerful Kuhgelus to the insignificant Surkhis, would get a wholesome fright and temporarily moderate their exuberance. The Government could sequester much of Soulet’s wealth and thus obtain invaluable cash for further enterprises. For, at least, a year or two, both the Kawamis and Zaigam would have their hands too full to be able to work against the Government, who would have breathing space to organise its strength in order to prevent either party from acquiring a preponderant position to the detriment of the Government. Moreover, both Zaigam and the Kawamis, being in need of Government support at the beginning, could be used, with great effect for the restoration of order. . . Zaigam, with Government support and with the co-operation of the Kawamis mcase of need, could reduce the Kasbgais who are now~ out of hand. He is-related, by the maniage of his fuli brother Ali Khan, to the Bakhtiari khans, with whom he is on friendly terms. He could he successfully used to chastise, with Bakhtiari co-operation, the Kuhgelus. I he Government could not with safety give Soulet enough support to enable him to reduce the refractory Kashgais, even if the Kawamis refrained from embarrassing him in his task. Soulet would and could not chastise the Kuhgelus. The Government would presumably give the Khamseh tribes to Nasr-ed-Dowleh^whoj by the prestige of his family’s former domination, could, with Government support and the co-operation of Zaigam in case of need, reduce these now rebellious tribes. No one but a Kawami could reduce these tribes except with a force larger than any the Persian Government can at present dispose of. The Kawamis, whose large estates in Bar, Uarab, and Sabah have been ruined by the disorders, could be successfully used to restore order in those regions. No one else could restore order there except with a force larger than any the Persian Government can at present dispose of, Kawam-ul- Mulk could be reappointed to the governorship of Kerman. With a Bakhtiari governor in Yezd the governors of, the three provinces of Pars, Kerman, and Yezd, together with the chief of the Khamseh tribes, could co-operate to control these migratory tribes, which are continually crossing from one of these provinces into the other. The combinations, by which the Government could, even without an efficient army or large money supplies, work for a general restoration of order, are of the greatest variety. It may be said that this is an ideal prospect and that the Persian authorities are unlikely to show the statesmanship requisite to make the most of their advantages. I am fully alive to this fact, and am sure that incapacity, corruption, and intrigues will make the Government miss most of their chances. Still, order can, in my opinion, only be restored in Pars by the Persian Government along the broad lines indicated above. The combination of Ain-ed-Dowleh, who has the name with the experience, and Saham-ed-Dowleh, who has the energy and capacity, in which the former is perhaps deficient, seems to be almost the best conceivable for Pars. It is not impossible that these two men, if they ever actually come to Pars, may be able to utilise some of the advantages accruing from the overthrow of Soulet-ed-Dowleh. I foresee two objections, which will at once be raised by some people to the policy outlined above. Firstly, it will he said that Zaigam and the Kawamis may unite and constitute a power dangerous to the Government. I think this is unlikely, as their interests are sure to diverge soon after the attainment of their mutual object, i.e., the overthrow of Soulet-ed-Dowleh. However, even granting the existence of this danger, it is evidently much less serious than the danger of Soulet’s succeeding in forming a combination hostile to the central Government. Secondly, it will be asked what guarantee there is that the Kawamis, having recovered their strength, will not create disorders as they have done in the past. Disorders have been created by the Kawamis in the past for three reasons : They have created disorders with the object of discrediting and overthrowing the Ilkhani of the Kashgais (Soulet-ed-Dowleh), who was damaging their material intertsts After Soulet’s overthrow this reason would not exist, at any rate not for several years, by which time the Government would have had leisure to re-establish its authority sufficiently to control the conflicting elements in Pars. The Kawamis also created disorders at the instigation of the ex-Shah, the then recognised head of the Government, with which the Kawamis’ interests are bound up. Muhammed Ali Mirza’s object was of course to discredit the Medjiiss. This reason now no longer exists for the Kawamis The third reason for which the Kawamis have created disorders in the past was to obtain the removal of a governor who was damaging their interests, to secure some minor object refused them by the Government, &amp;c. This reason is of course likely to recur in the future. However, the disorders created by the Kawamis for this last reason were of a restricted nature and never assumed the form of a rebellion or even formidable proportions. They were, therefore, much less serious than the more permanent and wider disorders created by Soulet for wider and more permanent objects. Moreover, the Kawamis have learnt a bitter lesson, as, unlike Soulet, they have suffered heavily from the disorders which they created. In future, they will probably be much more chary of stirring up disorders which must recoil on themselves. Anyhow, I submit that, at the worst, the Persian Government have only a choice of evils and that the Kawami evil is undoubtedly preferable to that of Soulet. There is another objection which may be raised, namely, that the success of this policy will mean an immense strengthening of the Bakhtiari domination in Persia. It is not for me to express an opinion as to whether this is or is not desirable. This [1805 t—2&gt; | 06 question is a very large one, and, as it is beyond my competence, I can only touch on it lightly^ ^ m treated thig difficu l t question from the point of view of the possibility of a native settlement, which, I presume, His Majesty s Government would much prefer to a settlement brought about by our active intervention It may perhaps be ar-rued that, as we are prepared to intervene to protect our interests, it is not worth our while to middle with the complicated native interests in conflict in Furs It will be said that the Persian authorities are disorganised, corrupt, with the virtue well- nitrh gone out of them, and that it is useless to try to guide them towards any policy, as°they will be unable to see where their interests lie, or, if they do see, will be unable to show the capacity requisite for success. I frankly admit that there is something m. this-argument. W hat I have seen of the eccentricities of the Persian Government as regards Pars since the departure of Sardar Assad from the Ministry of the Interior does not encourage me to believe that tlm Persian Government are likely to show the ability necessary to deal successfully with the delicate problem of Fars. While admitting all this, I venture to think that, precisely in view of the possibility o our eventual intervention, there are strong reasons why we should lose no chance, however slight of working for Soulet’s overthrow by the Persian Government. It we are compelled to intervene actively, our task would be much simplified by the disappearance of Soulet-ed-Dowleh. I am presuming that His Majesty’s Government, m the event of our intervening, wish that intervention to be as limited as possible, it would be useless to shut our eyes to the fact that the assumption on our P a ff ^lie task of policing a road running through districts swarming with armed and lawless Hibes^ is likely to involve us in still wider interventions. The local levies, raised by British officers, may be attacked; such attacks would necessitate punitive expeditions to prevent the recurrence ol similar incidents, the policing of the road might even gradually and almost imperceptibly develop into a general occupation. These dangers would be much lessened by the overthrow of Soulet-ed-Dowleh. After his suppression there would remain no one element of disorder strong enough to incite effectively and widely the lesser elements of disorder. Ihen w 7 e should generally have to fear only genuine freebooting raids on the road, and not raids instigated tor ultenoi motives. If the Persian Government will not or cannot suppress Souiet-ed-Dowdeh, I fear that, in the end, we may be forced to do it ourselves in order to ensure permanent security along the Bushire-Ispahan telegraph route. It would, therefore, seem to our advantage to spare no effort to induce the Persian Government to undertake this task themselves, and thus spare us future complications should w T e be forced eventually to intervene. In terminating the arguments, wdiich, in my opinion, make the overthrow of Soulet-ed-Dowleh imperative, I cannot omit one important consideration. As long as Souiet remains in power, it will be almost impossible to apprehend and punish the assailants of Messrs. Bill and Passek. If only for the safety of Europeans in Pars the attainment of this object would seem to be of vital importance. If the Persian Government fail to give effect to our representations against Soulet-ed-Dowdeh, I do not see how we should be any worse off than now. Souiet s friendship has been proved to be absolutely worthless, and, once we are secure from the attacks of his malignity, we can, it would seem, afford to treat his hostility with contempt. While adhering generally to the policy of non-intervention in Persia, we have always considered ourselves justified in offering advice to the Persian Government m the interests of order. In the past we have, by representations to the Persian Government, greatly helped Souiet. Our attitude in this respect has even caused some bitterness here. In fact I should not be at all surprised if, in the event of our intervening, the Nationalist press were to cite this support of Sonlet us typical of England’s Machiavellian policy and as part of her perfidious plan to prolong the disorders in Southern Persia, in order to justify her intervention. By precedent, therefore, we would seem to. be justified in making representations to the Persian Government against Soulet-ed-Douleh, especially as we are now contemplating the possibility of active intervention in the internal affairs of Persia. Moreover, such action on our part would be popular here. I may mention, in this connection, that after the news of our warning to the Persian Government got known in Shiraz, several respectable Persians asked me why, if we intended intervening, we did not attack the root of the evil, and, by threats or force, remove Soulet-ed-Dowleh from Persia. If. after consultation with Colonel Cox, you should think it advisable to abandon our attitude of neutrality in the sense I have proposed, 1 would suggest the following procedure. We should, in Tehran, point out to the Persian Government the desirebility, in the interests of order and the unity of Persia, of overthrowing Soulet-ed- Dowleh and replacing him by his brother, Zaigam-ed-Dowleh, as soon as circumstances permit. Simultaneously, I should be authorised in Shiraz to declare myself openly as suitable occasions occurred, in favour of the above policy. Locally, my partisanship in this sense might, coupled with the knowledge that we are, in certain eventualities, prepaied to intervene actively to protect our interests on the Bush ire—Ispahan telegraph route, produce considerable effect. If it became known among the Kashgais, many wayerers might rally to Zaigam’s banner, and the overthrow of Soulet might be made easier. 0 For the sake of convenience, I will briefly recapitulate the main arguments of this lengthy despatch :— The overthrow of Soulet-ed-Dowleh is the only chance of a native settlement. His disappearance will greatly lessen the difficulties, and tend to circumscribe the scope of our intervention, if eventually necessary. Our declaring ourselves openly against Sowlet will increase the chances of success in the enterprise against him. If this enterprise is not attempted, or fails, we have nothing to fear from Soulet, since we are prepared, in case of necessity, to intervene effectively to protect our interests on the Bushire-Ispahan telegraph route. By the time this despatch reaches you I earnestly hope the new Governor-General will be on his way to Bars. The moment will therefore be propitious for our taking action in the sense I have suggested should you consider it advisable. I shall therefore be grateful for the favour of telegraphic instructions. I have forwarded a copy of this despatch to Colonel C 03 ;, who, with his greater experience of Fars, and in view of the interests entrusted to his care outside of Fars, may see in the course which I have suggested objections not apparent to me. In conclusion, I must apologise for the inordinate length of this despatch. I gather that in the past, by excessive compression and by presuming a too great familiarity with local conditions on the part of people far away from the scene of action, 1 have been guilty of obscurity. I therefore thought it advisable, even at the risk of being tedious, to sacrifice brevity to clearness. I have, &amp;c. W. A.

The latter however- sent with him 80 road guards who were ready on the spot and they got safely to Shulgistan. The next day, when there was every possibility of fresh disorders on that portion of the road Mr. Bill, without giving information to the local authorities, finding out the condition of the road, and asking for guards returns to Abadeh. In view of the above facts Your Excellency will ad mitIt admit that the local authorities had not failed in their duties and that the incident had been the result of Mr. Bill's carelessness and haste. The ‘ governor had urged him to postpone his journey and wait for guards because he was anticipating such in- cidents. While expressing my deepest regret for this incident I have now the honour to point out to Your Excellency that Mr. Bill's haste and refusal to I take notice of the local Governor's earnest pressure have led to this incident and have entirely removed the responsibility of the local governor.

Mr. Bill, in reporting the circumstances to His Majesty's Legation, stated that the Deputy Governor had not the slightest idea how to procure the proposed reinforcements and it would have been impracticable for Mr. Bill to remain indefinitely at Abac eh. More over Mr. Bill was actually accompanied from Abadeh by 12 local 'Sowars', 25 local 'tufangchis' and 3 extra Persian Cossacks, in addition to his own escort con sisting of 13 Indian 'Sowars' and 4 Persian Cossacks. It His Excellency Hussein Kuli Khan.It will therefore he seen that Mr. Bill’s escort consisted of 57 armed men. I am, however, in no way concerned as to the question whether or not the Deputy Governor was res ponsible. The fact remains that one of His Majesty’s Consular Officers while travelling on the high road in Persia was attacked and two of his Consular es cort killed. The Persian Government is obviously responsible for the security of its roads and I must request that reparation for this outrage on a British Consular Officer and the killing of two of his es cort may no longer be delayed.

He made no allusion to question of retention of troops, and I therefore thought it better to refrain from commenting on his reference to that subject on 15th November. His Excellency said that two months would be ample for the Russian conversion negotiations if the Persians were sincerely willing to arrive at a settlement, but, owing to violent hostility of the Minister for Foreign Affairs to Russia, he feared that Persian Government would prove obstructive, knowing they would obtain their loan in any case. I said it would be strange if the two representatives could not bring Persian Government to a settlement.

You should explain to Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs that the line which I have been following in conjunction with Russian Government is to place the Persian Government in a position to establish their authority and secure order in Persia. But I have regarded it as one condition of this policy that Russian vested interests must not be prejudiced, and British Minister at Tehran has therefore been instructed to support his Russian colleague. For the same reason I have not demurred to measures which Russian Government considered necessary in north of Persia for protecting Russian interests, though it has been difficult at times to reconcile the continued presence of all the Russian troops in Persia, more especially the force at Kazvin, with conditions which Russian Government themselves stated would govern presence of Russian troops in Persia. Meanwhile I am much pressed by commercial firms as to obstruction, danger, and disorder of southern trade routes, which must continue till Persian Government have money. Russian trade has, it is understood, not suffered to same extent, and to expect us to use all our influence to prevent Persian Government obtaining means necessary to restore order, which is essential to our trade, is to place us in an invidious and impossible x&gt;osition. Acting Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs will, I am sure, appreciate consistent support which we have given to Russian Minister at Tehran, and that it has been given relying upon equal consideration for British interests being forthcoming when occasion required. (Confidential.) Comment upon reference to troops would be that indefinite stay of Russian troops in full strength when or where not required to protect life and property, especially when combined with refusal or prevention of all financial help to Persian Government, would not be consistent with maintenance of a native Government in Persia at all.

The troops would have to remain in North Persia for years, which would, he supposed, be as unpleasant for the British as it would be to the Russian Government. I said that I could not understand how an operation giving Persian Government some 300,000Z. could really have an unfavourable influence on the Russian conversion negotiations. His Excellency replied that the fact remained, Persians being what they were, that it did so ; and he showed me a telegram from the Russian Minister stating that the cash advance made by the bank seemed already to have unfavourably disposed the Persian Government in regard to the conversion.

I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. Enclosure in No. 1. Hussein Kuli Khan to Sir G. Barclay. (Translation.) 1 our Excellency. Tehran, October , 1910. NOTE has been taken of the purport of your Excellency’s communication of the 10th Shavval, 1328 (a.h.) (14th October, 1910), respecting the southern roads, and I now have the honour to say that His Majesty’s Government, being well aware (of the fact), should therefore admit in what (a deplorable) condition the country was in when, after the decline of the former disturbances, the Persian Government last year took up the reins of Government, seeing that all the affairs and Government administrations—especially the finances—were in complete disorder, and that the foundations of security and public contentment were completely disturbed. Though (the Government were) daily confronted with obstacles, such as the stay of bodies of foreign troops in the interior of the country—which causes public uneasiness, and is the pretext for incitement and intrigue on the part of persons who profited by the former disturbances—as well as other incidents, such as those at Karachidagh, Ardebil, Zenjan, Veramin, &amp;c., which constantly occupied the Government forces at several points ; from that date to this the affairs of the country have, in many instances, improved and are improving. But unfortunately, in certain places, the intrigues of persons who, for their own profit, wish that the country should remain in the state of disturbance of the former regime, are still going on, as explained below, and have not entirely ceased. For instance, certain persons, after being guilty of sedition and intrigue, take refuge in various legations, and, availing themselves of the protection afforded to them, consider themselves exempt from exile, which is customary in the case of such refugees, and intrigue within and without the precincts of the legation. Others again, by methods the illegality of the majority of which has never been contested, such as proteges, considering themselves immune, do not recoil from any kind of incitement or sedition. In the same way others who pass among the people as Persian subjects, but in reality, relying on their foreign nationality, commit crimes with audacity and in complete confidence, and afterwards, declaring themselves to be foreign subjects, evade the jurisdiction of the Government. And also persons, undoubted Persian subjects, who by illegal means pretend they are foreign subjects, and then commit various kinds of sedition. These conditions, which cause the utmost trouble to the Government, provoking disturbances in the country, and, furthermore, the continued stay of bodies of foreign troops, have encouraged some persons to treasonable consideration of a return of the former regime and give them unfounded hopes. Apart from the fact that the Government’s attention and time is thereby, to an extraordinary degree, directed to considerations and necessities relating to home affairs, this matter is naturally a cause of regret and sorrow, as a prolongation of this state of affairs might possibly cause a blow to and injure trade between Persian and British subjects in the southern provinces. [2968 x-1] ( !\ ' f/W 4The Persian Government is of opinion that c+ntP of affairs apart from the reasons above stated, is the unlortunate impression cause AftShay of bodies of foreign troops and the financial straits and embarrass- ment of the Government, which is one of the consequences of the mismanagement and carelessness of the former regime. ^ •, i -1 t +1,^ forops af*' If these unfortunate impressions and financial stiaits did not exist, the iorces ai nresent at the Government disposal would be sufficient for the maintenance of order, and the maintenance of order on the southern roads would present no difficulty m itSel But as mentioned above, it is because of financial straits and embarrassments that the Government has not been able to fulfil its principal aim, which is that of increasing security. ^ of Foreign Affai of the 2 6th Eabbi-ul-Avvel (a.h ) (7th April, 1910) it was brought to your Excellency’s notice that he new Government, as soon as formed, had laid it down in the programme which they presented o the Mediliss that a portion of the advance and loan which they had in view should he devoted to the increase of security on the roads. Consequently the Minister of hinance and Foreign Affairs of that day entered into negotiations with youi Excellency regarding “ ad The C note d orthe 5th Sefer, 1323 (a.h.) (16th February, 1910', in answer to the efforts of the Persian Government, contained conditions laid down by tie nis Government for that small advance, the acceptance of which would have been contrary to the independence of the kingdom, the maintenance of which is the primary duty of every Government. In view of these circumstances the Persian Government sought for other means of procuring funds. In the meantime, your Excellency s note of the 3rd Rabbi-ul-Avvel, 1328 (a.h.) (16th March, 1910), regarding the international syndicate, brought about discussions and exchanges of notes which caused delay in the obtaining of the fund necessary for the purpose of increasing security on t ie roads. At the same time, besides the fact that the discussions and exchange o notes above mentioned created results which preoccupied the Persian Government, they brought about ideas among the public, the result of which m course of time has led o the situation referred to in your Excellency’s recent note. . Under these circumstances, your Excellency’s sense of justice will cause you to admit that if the new Government had not at the outset been confronted with these difficulties in obtaining money, the maintenance of complete security would have been much easier for the Government than it is at present. . . , . In spite of this the Persian Government have not for an instant swerved Irom their purpose, and, with the accomplishment of this object in view, they are considering the following means of obtaining funds :— . , They are in process of negotiation with a group regarding their recognise (consolidated) debt to the Imperial Bank with lower interest, and the Persian Government is of opinion that in this manner a sum of money will be available wJ TCh will enable them quickly to put an entire stop to sedition and incitement. I he guarantee which the Persian Government propose to offer for this loan is the same guarantee which was given for their recognised (consolidated) debt to the Imperial Bank, on account of the revenues of the southern customs.* lor this reason the guarantees of Persia’s other loans will in no way suffer. ^ _ » Ih view of the Persian Government’s anxiety respecting the immediate security ol the commercial highways, they consider it very appropriate that the greater part of the expenditure now necessary for increasing the security of the roads should he met by the funds obtained by this transaction, and they assure His Majesty’s Government that the Indian loan of 1904 will in no way be adversely affected by this financial measure. In these circumstances, the Persian Government are quite confident that Pis Majesty’s Government, in view of their anxiety respecting the development o commerce, will look favourably upon this transaction, which the Persian Government have in view chiefly on this account. ? , At the same time, I think it necessary to draw your Excellency’s attention to tne fact that as the Persian Government cannot every year, by successive loans, meet its requirements, they must find a source of revenue to meet each requirement; and tne best source of revenue obtainable at the present time, under the present conditions o Persia, which could furnish a portion of the sum required for the gendarmerie, is t a very suggestion contained in your Excellency’s last note regarding an increase o 10 per cent, on the customs revenues. * The part italicised does not appear in the French translation.—G. P. C.But as the proposal contained in the above-mentioned note is contrary to the undoubted independence of the Persian Government, the friendly relations and the ami y w ic up ti 1 now nave existed between the two Governments, the Persian Government can never under any circumstances consent to it. But as, on the other hand, the 1 ersian Government take particular note of the anxiety of His Maiesty’s Government respecting the commercial highways, and as the Persian Government consequently regard the maintenance of their own independence and the removal of His Majesty s Government’s anxieties on this score as identical, they consider it desirable that this 10 per cent, tax should be levied on the customs by the Persian Government themselves and be expended on the necessary increase of security. Persian Government therefore request His Majesty’s Government, through the medium of your Excellency, that they should give their support to the accomplish ment of this aim , and as this request of the Persian Government is made with the object of developing commerce, and the Persian Government consider its fulfilment necessaiy for the maintenance of the very same security which you mentioned, its acceptance should be hastened. Before concluding this note I consider it necessary, in order to prove that commerce has not suffered, to draw the attention of His Majesty’s Government to the extraordinary increase of the customs receipts from the south. Without, however, entirely denying that in recent times there have been any kind of troubles and obstacles in the way of means of commerce between Persia and England, I consider that it is shown by the statistics of customs revenue that no real commercial losses have been sustained by British subjects, while, on the other hand, the increase of 100,000 tomans in the Arabistan customs receipts in the year “ Takagoui-il ” (1909-10), as compared to the previous year, and the extraordinary increase during the present year, conclusively proves that southern commerce has only been temporarily diverted from its former channel. Furthermore, the whole of Persia’s commercial imports during last year showed an increase of about 19 per cent, over those of the year “Pichi-il” (1908-9), and during the five months of the present year an increase of 20 per cent, is shown. In view of the facts above stated, the Persian Government are of opinion that foreign subjects have no cause of complaint regarding commerce with Persia. (Usual ending omitted.) (L.S.)

Goschen to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received November 7.) Berlin, November 2, 1910 THE German newspapers, with very few exceptions, are at present working hard to place every word and every action of His Majesty’s Government in Persia in the worst possible light, and to persuade their readers that the first steps towards the division of Persia between England and Russia have been made, and that the assurances given by His Majesty’s Government on this point are not worth the paper they are The ‘ 4 Hamburger Nachrichten,” never a very friendly paper to England, leads the van in this campaign against our Persian policy, while the Kreuz ” is not far behind. I have not as yet thought it necessary to trouble you with many press opinions upon the Persian policy of His Majesty’s Government, but the latest article in the 44 Hamburger Nachrichten ” is worth quoting, if only to show to what lengths misrepresentation can be carried by a German newspaper when it gives its mind to it. The article begins by saying that the tendency of the semi-official organs is to belittle the importance of the 44 British ultimatum,” and more especially of the landing of British sailors in Persian territory, and to contest the accuracy of the supposition that these proceedings are the first step in the direction of the partition of Persia. It adds that the people who hold these ideas consider the assurances given by His Majesty’s Government, with regard to the maintenance of Persian independence, to be of such a binding nature as to leave no doubt of their sincerity, and they regard the landing of British 44 troops ” as a mere local affair necessitated by the circumstances of the case, and entirely justified by the unique position which Great Britain holds in the Persian Gulf. After thus stating the case of the defenders of British policy the article continues :— 44 We, ourselves, consider this view as optimistic, and are of the firm opinion that neither the British nor the Russian troops will ever be withdrawn from Persia. We hold that the marauding expedition, which was the ostensible ground for the landing of British troops, has every appearance of being 4 a put-up job ’ ( 4 eine bestellte Arbeit ’). It will be remembered that the British ultimatum stated that British troops would be called in unless within three months the Persian Government restored order in Southern Persia. It is quite possible that subsequently the British Government thought fit, for some reason or other, to shorten the period laid down by the ultimatum, and, with this intent, manufactured a reason for intervention. The Persian Government naturally demanded the immediate withdrawal of the British sailors, but that, of course, will not help them much. The English Minister gave the laconic answer that the force would be withdrawn 4 as soon as circumstances permitted.’ That answer requires no comment. The British troops in Egypt were to be withdrawn 4 as soon as circumstances permitted.’ They are still there.” After calling attention to the fact that, as matters now stand, both British, Russian, and Turkish troops are standing in readiness to fall upon Persia, the writer of the article gives his opinion that Germany should carefully abstain from any interference in Persian affairs beyond that which is necessary for the defence of her commercial interests. 44 The Turks,” he says, “ are endeavouring to urge us in a contrary direction, and are doing all they can to persuade us that Germany, in her own interests and for the sake of her prestige in Turkey, must take the leading part in the Persian question. They point out that Germany must do one of two things : either she must, like Turkey, show in an unmistakable manner that she is determined to have her say in Persian affairs, cr she must sacrifice her trade interests in that country and hand them over to England and Russia. We have sufficient confidence in the directors of our foreign policy to feel assured that no more attention will be paid to these suggestions than was given to the telegram from the Perso-Turkish league in Constantinople. ’ | 296$ g —21_ ~| n . i • i q Kripf* reference to the hiffh-handed. manner in which tXZfAZZ Ministers extracted from the Persian Government the Sr hn^n, Count Reventlow, m the Tageszeitung also has an^ar tm ^ ^ ^ hi ^ calls attention to the activity o o' 1 ;; ., ssurance s given by His Majesty’s Government readers against putting any ai , . . j f show how little assurances from that no partition of Persia is contemp ated and to show ho that that source are to be credited, points out . of a P e Jan official, the the landing of troops at Lmgeh was carried out at the t Count Keventlow Persian Government is protesting agan English sphere of influence, makes a great deal of the fact that ^ / e routeS) which and points out, moreover, that tne greater pomo s Great Britain proposes to protect with Indian officers ^troops,^le ^ a^Twr-opS,: wbi* “if Grfaf Britein’f St-rejwated^eclaration, that Z 3' ,,*» w*.. —h- ^ * ■ i~» m ■ »** inroad into Persia. th;s ; s the keynote of most of the articles written here on the IPeraianJuestion —how the Russians will relish the British conception of a n^S f- U he observes that they will speedily realise that fhrJrifiri form, but JvtlopTdTn thflffi^s which Great Britain finds most adV Tfr ^ ““ndi^f the Czar he reminds his readers that His Majesty once said to Prince Hohenlohe, who had spoken to lum about the mtention 1“ SK»T£23U 'w= p »“» £ —* Engiisn are happy ^ from these newspapers in order tha^munwy have Britain and Russia.

In commenting upon this paragraph the paper which publishes it says ^that i in this very correct statement of German policy due emphasis is placed on the mu of the last sentence, it is of the highest importance for German commercial cir to know what steps will be taken by the Imperial Government to secure the nece i y guarantees that the principle of the open door will be effectively and abso ) upheld.

Another rumour put about .7 r ln 'P s 18 dat the whole incident was the result of a British intrigue to put t 111 an embarr assing position, and damage German prestige by their unavoidable failure to respond to the appeal. An important local organ, the “Sabah,” has published a couple of historical and reasoned articles on the subject from the pen of an influential Armenian, and it must be remembered that the Armenians have never forgiven William II for his speech at Damascus and his friendly visit to Abdul Hamid shortly after the massacres. One of ese articles shows that _ the Morocco agreement resulting from the Emperor’s dramatic visit to Tangier did not obtain for the Moroccans any better terms than those already secured to the Persians by the Anglo-Russian Agreement of 1907. It is perhaps noticeable that the Persian Minister in Berlin is about to be transferred to Constantinople, and, as pointed out before, it is not improbable that the Hermans may be advising the Young Turks to reply to the British action, should the necessity for the latter arise, by some further advance in West Persia. Such an advance must, however, almost necessarily be confined to the northern or Russian sphere, and it is difficult to see how the Turks are to go beyond the area alreadv under their influence without compromising the existence of Persia. Despatches from Van point to their consolidating their position by the appointment of military officers as kaimakams at Ushun and Mawana, and four Turkish battalions are said to be scattered through the “annexed” districts. I have reminded the Porte that the status of Kotur was settled by the Treaty of Berlin, and thus became international. 1 have, &amp;c. GERARD LOWTHER. [2988 &lt;7-1] COPY ID* INDIA /S...

Pheie can he little doubt that this article emanates from the Vienna Press Bureau, and as such is worthy of some attention. The writer falls into the error based on too hasty assumptions that the note inevitably prepares the way for the occupation and division of Persia by Great Britain and Russia. It is not, perhaps, surprising that the Vienna writer should do so, seeing that, according to telegrams in the press here, certain papers in England have at once jumped to the same conclusion, though, so far as I am aware, the “Times” has not, as stated in this article, “declared with praiseworthy frankness that the partition of Persia is the inevitable condition for granting a loan to that country.” Be this statement true or not, the interesting part of the article lies in the fact that the writer infers that Russia and Great Britain are agreed to occupy and divide Persia, and that this policy formed part of the Anglo-Russian entente from its inception, that it is merely the opposition of Persian patriots struggling to be free which has, so to speak, forced the pace of the two Governments in the matter, that the Berlin Cabinet, despite its hitherto calm and moderate attitude, will be forced by public opinion in Germany to interfere to protect German interests, and lastly that this policy, aiming at the partition of Persia by Great Britain and Russia, will greatly damage Turkish prestige, on account of the blow it will inflict on Islam, and that the Young Turks will now really be convinced that Triple Entente Powers are their enemies. It means for the Young Turks, so says the writer, but “another painful experience that would strengthen them in the conviction as to the little real value they can place on THE writer states that the “ Times ” has declared with praiseworthy frankness that the partition of Persia is the inevitable condition for the granting a loan to that country, the peaceful development of which was to have been secured by the treaty of the 31st August, 1907. The organ of the city, he contimies, proceeds to sketch out the programme for Anglo-Russian intervention. The British Government, according to this paraphrase of the “ Times ” article, has been regretfully forced to military action on account of the prolonged disorders in South Persia, and the harmony Continuing to write, presumably on his own inspiration and not quoting the “ Times,” the author of the article goes on, “ the treaty of 1907 was the documentary preparation for an Anglo-Russian occupation, although this was obstinately denied up to quite recently.” If Persia had shown herself a little more subservient to Anglo- Russian demands, Persian independence might have been allowed to subsist for a short time longer. But as the Persian patriots made use of every single opportunity to light against a scarcely disguised protectorate, they have lost, in the opinion of their PERSIA. [October 31.] CONFIDENTIAL.

It is always possible that the London and St. Petershurgh Cabinets might have been glad to put oft action a little longer, but the fear of surprises brought about by the opposition of the I ersian Government has caused them to act with speed. In Tehran hopes were entertained oh. the intervention of some third party, and the opportunities foi sue _ m eivention as regards both the loan question and other matters had been often pointed out. It is possible, says the article, that anxiety is felt in London and St. Petersburgh that these efforts might some day be crowned with success, whereby the guardianship of Persia would be seriously endangered. Perhaps it is also thought m those cities that complications with other Powers are most easily avoided by establishing a fait Q;CC01TIT)Lz* Last summer, when there was much irritation in Berlin o\er the Anglo-Russian treatment of the loan question, which irritation was increased by an insolent article in the u Novoe Vremya, ,&gt; the u Rossia n poured oil on the troubled waters. _German optimists then believed that England and Russia aimed at loyal co-operation with Germany which would give reasonable satisfaction to German intei ests. ^Sceptics, however, warned them that this attempt at conciliation on the part of the Rossia was no more than by-play. Now both these two camps will no doubt demand that the Imperial Government should take energetic action. ^ ft he moderation of German statesmen will certainly prevent them from being hurried into action by the pressure of public opinion ; but it is undeniable that the Cabinet of Berlin stands face to face with a new and serious situation, if the threats of England, and Russia are carried out. It has hitherto always recognised that England and Russia have a privileged political position in Persia, but it would not allovr Germany to be cut off from the economic exploitation (“ Exploitierung ”) of Persia. A guarantee that she would not be so cut off, would be hardly obtainable after a division of Persia had actually taken place. It is precisely the moderation and coolness with which the development of events in Persia has been treated up to now at Berlin, which justify the assumption that strong measures of intervention will be taken there if the German sphere of interest, which, for the sake of dear peace, has been rather narrowly circumscribed, appears to be threatened. ft.'he interest of 'Turkey would also be threatened in more than one direction by a division of Persia. The Young Turk Government has enforced by military measures its claim to consideration as a neighbouring Power, and they would lose in prestige, if a foreign yoke were imposed on Persia without any protection of those rights. Mohammedan solidarity is a pillar of support for the Young Turks as regards both their nationality and their future policy. For this reason alone they are^ bound to consider the subjugation of Persia by England and Russia as an attack on their prestige in the Mussulman world. Another painful experience would strengthen them in the conviction as to the little real value they can place on the assurances—so often pathetically repeated—of benevolence on the part of the Triple Entente. The realisation of the plans of England and Russia is likely to start active unrest both in the Near and the Far East and to make antagonisms, which are already acute enough, still more acute.

October 29th, 1910 1 III Sir: I have the honour to forward herewith, as narked in the margin, an extract from the'TaBvir-i-Efkyar' of the 26th instant, on the subject of the so-called 'partition' of Persia. A member of this Enbassy, who recently had an Interview with the writer of this article, took the opportunity of commenting in a friendly way on the distorted views to which expression is given therein. I have, &amp;c., (Signed) His Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.h ( 7 ®&gt; ! • I Octotier 26 th, 1910. Yesterday's Tasv.tr-1-Efkyar has a leading article by Ebuzzia Tewflk Bey, entitled 'What Is to become of Persia?'. The following Is a full paraphrase Lord Salisbury Is credited with the dicta that on I the day when England comes to an agreement v/ith Russia she must he understood to have despaired of the Ottoman * Enpire, and that when she achieves an entente with Russia she will leave Russia to do as It pleases in the East. Said Pasha's memoirs contain a remark similar In sense to the first of these propositions. Lord Salisbury's dictum has now been fulfilled, in principle, by the Anglo-Russian agreement of August 31st, 1907, for the delimitation of spheree of influence in Persia, and partially in actual fact at the present time hy the partition of Persia. It is not for us to say whether it is or is not advisable for England to undertake V. Joint action in Persian affairs, hut what v/e see to day illustrates in a curious fashion a paragraph in the celebrated letter written hy the Enir Abdurrahman to the Viceroy of India in 1867, when he asked the reasonwhy England, which had undertaken two expeditions and taken so much anxious trouble to repel an unassisted kim i nr i attack by the Persian Shah on Herat, locked on so calmly ■ » : ^ ^ ^ 1 ' imprevidently at Russia preparing to pour troops down as far as Chian, with all Persia in the position of auxiliaries and as many warlike peoples under vassalage to the Tsar. Why is England on her guard against Persia? The majority of Indian Moslems are Shiites, and it is be cause there is no bond between Christians and Shiites | that England attaches more importance to Persian than to , fifi~ Russian aggressions, as was illustrated by her action i sixty years ago. Indeed her regard for the Afghans is due to their being Sunni and serving as a buffer between r. t Persia and India. The starting point of British policy in Asia is India, and its aim is the safeguarding of India. Russia's policy is to cultivate understandings with every Power having opposed interests, with a view to impairing the integrity of the Ottoman Sultanate. The Power v/hich England must fear in Asia is Russia. Now in the Persians,(|(J) of Shiites, end for this reason the Persians will form the first line in Russian attacks on India. What can he the value of the forty or fifty thousand men whom England will send from Afghanistan or Beluchistan or march from Herat against the deluge of Russian cossacks and the Turcoman savages infatuated hy hearsay from their hirth with the wealth of India? This it was that made England think. She realised that one day she would have to meet an unforeseen attack of this kind from Russia, and then goodbye to India. Hav ing no further concern with the Eastern question she has considered a policy of connivance or non-interfer- ence in questions relating to the Ottoman Hnpire as the basis of an entente with Russia, just as by giving Prance a free hand in Morocco she set up a barrier to any French opposition in connection with Egypt. And now by engaging in a friendly partition of Persia she fehows that she has promised to connive at independent action as regards the Turkish Unpire, or, as Lord Salisbury said, throw that Qnpire over. This change in the situation in Asia is not to be compared with the conquest of comparatively unimportant places like Bokhara, Khiva and Kashgar. Dilapidated asas it is, Persia has still a settled population of nine millions and a nomad of two millions more, while the f i \ 11 country is capable of every kind of development, adjoins I | Mesopotamia and is a kind of granary for corn going by the Persian Gulf to India. With modern methods of cultivation and transport the country might recover all it has lost owing to its former maladinini strati on and regain its former prosperity. This rich country it is which is falling a prey to two rapacious Powers. Can Turkey connive at this? In our opinion a State whose traditions go hack three or four thousand years and which numbers twelve or fourteen millions of inhabitants cannot, even in Asia, be wiped off the map of the world. An Austrian paper says that the Ottomans, who have manifested a new prestige to the world, will not consent to see the Persian waters of the Persian Gulf turned into a British sea, and English and Russian soldiers in occupation of Persian Irak. It is true that this partition of Persia is specially disastrous for Turkey. The English, after securing the south-western part of the Gulf, will obtain control from the Persian side of the estuary of the Tigris and Euphrates and will then over-run Mesopotamia. WhateverWhatever happens, the Turkish Government is interested in this matter on grounds of neighbourhood, of policy, and of Islamisnn It is a political necessity and a religious obligation to secure at once those places which adjoin important points on the frontier and in case of need to hasten to the aid of our oppressed brethren. It is not improbable that the excitement aroused by this event in India may have grave consequences. As it is not likely that Shiite soldiers will be chosen to be despatched from India against Persia, it cannot be as easy as is supposed to get the Moslems to eye indifferently the troops of other persuasions who will be sent. In short it is clear to those who know Indian conditions that England, with a hundred million Moslem subjects, mostly Shiite, may find herself involved in inextricable complications on account of this partition of Persia. The writer appends a translation of the principal articles relating to Persia in the Anglo-Russian agree ment of August 31st, 1907.Sir Edward Grey to Sir G. Barclay (Tehran). (No. o28.) ^ , Foreign Office, November 7, 1910, 5*5 p.^i. YOUR despatch No. 192 [of 15th October: southern roads]. One passage in the note seems to go farther than was intended bv me. I assumed, on receipt of your telegram No. 406 of 14th October that you had limited the terms of your note to the measures mentioned in that telegram, which corresponded with the arrangement which had been made with you in July last, and which formed the subject of correspondence between this Office and the India Office, copies of which are in your possession. The proposed measures were also communicated in writing to the Russian Government (see Mr. O’Beirne’s despatch No. 355 [of 24th August]). These measures were that, if in three months order was not restored, His Majesty’s Government would feel obliged to insist on the formation of a force of 1,000 or 1,200 men levied and officered by eight or ten officers from the Indian army. My telegram No. 289 [of 1st October] to you and the despatch to Sir A. Nicolson, No. 219 [of 8th August], to which you refer do not go so far as the concluding passage in paragraph 4 in your note of 14th October. On the contrary, telegram No.' 289 does not refer to the point in question, while my despatch No. 219 shows that I desired to avoid committing His Majesty’s Government to a policy of active intervention. When, therefore, reports appeared in the public press that intervention was threatened by His Majesty’s Government, a prompt denial was officially given. It must be clearly understood that, while His Alajesty’s Government reserve to themselves the right to take any measures which the protection of British subjects or trade renders necessary, they are not committed to a decision to send a British force to police roads extending far into the interior of Persia. &gt; COPY TO l K, n^ // f &amp; SEGiU i A f i i y-5 :| 755—272]1] [2968 PERSIA.

WITH reference to my telegram No. 400 of yesterday’s elate, I have the honour to transmit herewith copy of a note which I yesterday addressed to the Persian Govern ment, warning them that unless within three months order is restored to the satisfaction of His Majesty’s Government upon the Bushire-Ispahan road, His Majesty’s Government will themselves undertake to perform this duty. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. Enclosure in No. 1. Sir G. Barclay to Persian Government. M. le Ministre, Tehran, October 14, 1910. I HAVE repeatedly drawn the attention of the Persian Government to the deplorable insecurity of the roads in Southern Persia. Unfortunately my representations have produced no result. So far from there being any improvement, the state of these roads is w r orse to-day than at any time since the commencement of my mission in Persia. Robberies and outrages have become more and more frequent, and the principal channels through which British trade used to pass to the interior of the country are now practically closed by the depredations of tribesmen, who appear to be completely beyond the control of the central Government. I postpone for the moment dealing with the numerous claims presented by this legation and His Majesty’s consulates to the Persian Government and the local authorities on account of outrages to British subjects and robberies of British goods on the roads in question. Such claims, of which hardly one has been settled since I took up my post as His Majesty’s Minister to Tehran, will, of course, as occasion offers, continue to be pressed upon the Persian Government and the local authorities, and their settlement will be exacted in due course. I am now, however, principally concerned with the measures to be taken with a view to remedying a state of things which has at last become intolerable to His Majesty’s Government, and I am instructed by His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to inform you that, unless by three months from now order has been restored to the satisfaction of His Majesty’s Government upon the roads from Bushire to Shiraz, and from Shiraz to Ispahan, which are the^ routes which have been marked by the most flagrant outrages and disorders, His Majesty’s Government will be reluctantly comp elled themselves to take such steps as may be necessary to secure the proper policing of these roads. 1 may add that the measures contemplated in the first^ instance by His Majesty s Government, in the event of the Persian Government’s failing to restore order within the period named, involves the organisation for the policing of the roads in question of a local force of some 1,000 to 1,200 mem levied and commanded by a number of British officers from the Indian army. The expenses of this force would be met in part by a surcharge of 10 per cent, on the customs duties on all goods imported at the southern ports, and in part from the revenues of the province of Ears, a sufficient portion of which would have to be paid over with the above-mentioned surcharge on the customs duties to the officer commanding the force. I trust that this matter will receive the most earnest attention of the Persian Cabinet. While thus warning the Persian Government of the consequence of a continuance of the present deplorable situation on the southern roads, I avail, &amp;c. 1 F G.

(No. 289.) Sir, Berlin, October 20, 1910. THERE has not yet been any sign of inspired comment in the German press on the subject of the British note which has just been presented to the Persian Government. Several of the more independent newspapers, however, discuss the subject. The trend of their observations is in each case the same, and is to the effect that England and Russia have come to an agreement for the partition of Persia. The “ Kreuz-Zeitung ” hails the British note as the end of the policy of non-intervention in Persia. It says that England, having failed to persuade Russia to withdraw from Persia, has seen herself compelled to come to a definite agreement with her friend for a joint liquidation of the Persian question. The “Kolnische Zeitung ” regards the British note as the result of a scheme which has been carefully prepared by England and Russia, and adds that the two Powers are now confident of having reached the goal at which they have long been aiming. The “ Miinchener Neueste Nachrichten” thinks that the present situation in Persia is one which demands the closest attention of Germany, whose commercial interests it regards as threatened by a possible Russo- British intervention. It expresses the opinion that the commercial expansion of Germany in Persia had been completely checked by the Anglo-Russian agreement, and condemns a jealousy which would aim at excluding all other Powers except England and Russia from the exercise of any.political or financial influence in Persian affairs. The “ Vossische Zeitung” is particularly severe on the subject of the British note, which it describes as a threat to occupy the south of Persia, “ Russia refuses to evacuate the north of Persia; therefore England, with great regret of course, sees no other alternative but to take possession of the south.” The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed one of _ my colleagues that as far as he could judge at present he saw no cause for anxiety m the British communication to the Persian Government. He was comparatively indifferent to what took place, as long as the open door was maintained and German commercial and financial interests were not ignored. I have, &amp;c. W. E.

Following is text of proposed note :— “ Excellency, “ I have the honour to acknowledge your Excellency’s note of 21st October. “ In replying to this communication I do not deal with your Excellency’s reference to the presence in Persia of foreign troops and to protection afforded to bastis by foreign legations, as I consider these references to be irrelevant to the matter with which 1 am now specially concerned, viz., the outrages and depredations of tribesmen on southern trade routes. “Your Excellency points to increase in total volume of Persian trade for 1909-1910 as compared with year 1908-1909, and to further increase which has marked first five months of the current year, but I must point out that increase observable in 1909-1910 applied, as can be seen from customs returns, to north and not to south. In particular it will be seen on referring to published customs statistics that Bushire customs receipts for last year were much lower than in 1908-1909, just as in that year they had been very much lower than in 1907-1908. As regards increase during first five months of the current year, it should be remembered that this year’s harvest has been exceptionally abundant, and that first five months of last year, with which comparison is made, included period during which Bushire was in power of Seyyid Murtza and his Tangistanis, and I would draw your Excellency’s attention to the fact that, this notwithstanding, Bushire receipts only showed increase of 12^ per cent. “ But whatever may be statistics of trade for past months, it cannot be denied that certain of the roads are practically impassable. This especially refers to main southern trade rocte connecting Bushire and Ispahan—district on the confines of provinces of Ears and Ispahan being in a state of indescribable disorder, and although traffic between Bushire and Shiraz has not been latterly entirely stopped, it has only been able to pass by an inconvenient and circuitous route where merchandise is subject to drastic extortion and illegal fees, and only by sufferance of a tribal chief who is not under full control of the Government. “ There can, indeed, be no hope of any lasting revival so long as present anarchy continues on these southern roads, and it is with a view for securing for this deplorable state of things a remedy to be applied, if possible, by Persian Government, but if necessary/ by; British officers lent from Indian Army to Persian Government, that I have addressed your Excellency on the subject.^ “ As regards 10 per cent, surcharge on import duties on goods passing through southern customs, I am to state that Elis Majesty’s Government can only agree to this charge on condition that proceeds are spent effectively on securing safety of southern trade routes. The scheme foreshadowed in my note for organisation of a Persian force' with British officers would satisfy this condition.” 2I3J COPY TO iOHlACONFIDENTIAL. 28 OCT 1910 - A i nr t&gt; /f ^7 1 &gt; (No. 428.)

I further transmit copy of a letter to the India Office,! which will make clear to your Excellency the reasons for which, while entirely concurring in Mr. Marling’s view as to the necessity of a representation, I am reluctant to commit His Majesty’s Government to a policy of intervention on the scale proposed, but prefer, as suggested by Sir G.

Finally, I enclose copy of the reply of the India Office,f showing that that department concur in this latter proposal, and are willing, on certain financial conditions, to lend to the Persian Government officers of the Indian army should their services be required for the organisation of this force.

I have received French text of Persian Government’s note. Reuter telegram,. Tehran, of 22nd October, which please see, is a good summary. After consultation with the Russian Minister I would propose, subject to your approval, to reply pointing out that what is said about the presence of foreign troops and the abuse of bast at the foreign legations (Russian and Turkish) is irrelevant to the matter in hand, viz., depredations by tribesmen on southern roads ; that statistics showing increased customs receipts apply to the north rather than to the south, and that though it is true that for the last live months the southern customs show a considerable revival (Mohammerah customs, indeed, show a big increase) as compared with the same period last year, it must be remembered that the first months of last year were marked by the Tangistam troubles in Bushire, and m any case it cannot be denied that main southern road is practically impassable, owing to disorders, and so long as these continue there can be no lasting revival. I would make it clear that we could not allow surcharge on southern import duties except as part of our scheme, as we could have no confidence that the proceeds would be properlv used, and that however reluctant we may be to find ourselves compelled^ to take measures contemplated, which involve a minimum of interference in Peisian internal affairs, we intend to see them through if order is not restored in time allowed. I would also state in my reply that His Majesty’s Government will not view unfavourably any loan contracted with a good British house so long as it does not violate conditions laid down in joint note of the 7th April. (End of R.) (Very ConfidentiaL) I cannot deny that there is force in what the Persian Government say about abuse of bast and the presence of foreign troops, but I presume that in deference to Russia we are bound to treat these matters as irrelevant.

I have had version circulated in local press here and at Bagdad, but it is unlikely to overtake previous distorted account of our intended occupation of all South Persia, which forms the subject of a violent anti-British campaign in the local organs. At a crowded meeting held in a theatre here yesterday, and largely attended by officers, fierce speeches were made against England as the enemy of Islamic world in collusion with I ranee and Russia, while Germany, her Emperor, and her allies were called to protect Persia by intervention such as that “ which saved Morocco from the Anglo- French betrayer [sic]. The speakers, including a Smyrna deputy who visited England last year, naturally ignored Turkey’s wholesale absorption of Western Persia during recent year. One speaker denounced the brutality of our methods in giving the Persian Government and the world previous notice of our “contemplated usurpation” in contrast with more “ delicate methods ” of the Russians, who acted without such warning. The holding of such a public political meeting under the existing state of siege is significant. The Turkish Ambassador at Berlin arrived here suddenly yesterday, and has had conferences with members of the Government, assisted by Acting Minister of War. It is rumoured that this has reference to proposed concerted action of Germany and Turkey with regard to Persia.

In spite of repeated assurances no improvement has been made, and if the present situation continues the Gulf trade will be permanently affected. After full consultation with the Russian Government, and in complete accord with them, His Majesty’s Government decided to inform the Persian Government that unless order was restored on the Bushire-Ispahan road within three months’ time they must insist on the organisation of a local Persian force, officered by eight or ten British officers of the Indian army, for the protection of the road.

How does question of representations stand ? — [754—62]PERSIAN FINANCE. THE ATTITUDE OF RUSSIA. J'- (FROM OTJR CORRESPONDENT.) TEHERAN, Oct. 14 . The news that arrangements are being made with the Imperial Bank of Persia for the issue in London of a loan for the purpose of convert- ing the Consolidated Debt into a 5 per cent, sterling loan has brought Persian finance again under the limelight. By this operation the Persian Government will obtain a sum deemed sufficient to secure the restoration of order in the Southern proA'inces and on the English trade routes. It may be said immediately that there is no reason to suppose that the proposal has hitherto been the cause of any divergence of view between the Governments of Great Britain and Russia, as no Russian interests are involved and there is no ground to anticipate that Russia will urge any objection to a mere rearrangement of existing British securities on the Customs at the Gulf ports. Any such action is precluded by the recognizedly special position of England in the Persian Gulf as clearly defined by Sir Edward Grey in the Note covering the Anglo- Russian Convention. It is argued in some quarters that to consult Russia would be discourteous unless her views are to carry weight. On the other hand, if consulted, Russia would thereby be conceded a position in matters concerning the Gulf. This is a dilemma which needs considering. Grave interests are involved which the well-known sensitiveness of the public on everything affecting our supremacy in the Persian Gulf is unlikely to overlook. Kinglake’s Englishman, straining to hold his loved Lidia, is a permanent type, as the reverberations produced on a famous occasion by the wmrd “ Baghdad ” can testify. Nothing is known here concerning the attitude of the Indian Government. Russia, doubtless, fully appreciates the difficulty in Avhich the British Government would be placed regarding any representation to Persia concerning the state of the South, if any caveat were entered against the legitimate financial measures to betaken by Persia for the restoration of order. The Crown Jewels. It must be said that great restiveness is shown in English banking and commercial circles in Teheran, reflected apparently in the city, at the attitude Russia has hitherto adopted regarding financial assistance to Persia. A British bank was recently prepared to enable the Govern ment to realize money on the Crown jewels, but at the instance of the Russian Government the project was abandoned. Die same fate befell the Loan proposal in the Spring. The success of the two financial achievements of the year, the consolidation of bank debts and the organization of the Mint, is ascribed to the fact that as the British Government felt it its duty to communicate to Russia all the information it received, it was not considered necessary to keep it au courcmt ivith each stage of the negotia tions. The Russian troops are now prepared to go into winter quarters at Kazvin. staSmJnTS' ^ h “ ^ «* M^ng Recently published reports give an entirelv erroneous impression of the Note winch has been addressed to the Persian Government by his Majesty s Minister at Teheran on the condition of the southern trade routes.

But before we do so I ought to inform you that I have gathered from conversation with my Russian colleague that our scheme for the policing of the southern roads may lead to a similar demand from Russia for northern roads.

Lynch had approached the Anglo-Persian Oil Company with a view to obtain their assistance in the construction of the load, and that the Imperial Bank of Persia were ready to participate^ _ ^ tt- Mr. Mallet expressed his satisfaction at this intelligence^ and ^ said that liis Majesty’s Government would welcome any amalgamation of British interests in this matter. He enquired where it was proposed to begin remmdec Colonel Picot that the concession expired in 1912, and that His Majesty s Government would not be able to ask for an extension of the concession, in so far as the part of the road within the Russian sphere was concerned, without previously obtaining the concurrence of the Russian Government. He asked whether it would not be possible within the next two years to complete that part of the road. . , , Colonel Picot stated that it had been intended to begin work from the south, but that he would consider the point Mr. Mallet had mentioned about the part of the road within the Russian sphere. He said, however, that that section was particu ai y difficult, and that Messrs. Lynch would prefer to complete the road between Ivum and Ispahan, which would not require more than improvement. He added that the difficulty was that the Persian post had been making this tract, x am, occ. E. GREY. * Sir G. Mackenzie, April 11; June 25, 1910. [2824 Z—3] f To Sir G.

IN an aide-memoire dated the 16th (29th) July, 1910, His Majesty’s Embassy communicated to the Imperial Ministry of Foreign Affairs the substance of information received from His Majesty’s charge! d’affaires at Tehran relative to the insecurity prevailing on the trade routes of Persia, more particularly in the southern districts His Majesty s Embassy proposed that the two representatives at Tehran should be instructed to make a strong joint representation to the Persian Government on the subject. A despatch has now been received from His Majesty’s charge d’affaires, of which an extract is enclosed,'® giving particulars respecting the increasing disorders on the southern and other roads in Persia. In this despatch Mr. Marling suggested that the Persian Government should be informed that if order on the southern roads was not restored by the end of September His Majesty’s Government would themselves undertake to perform that duty. His Majesty’s Government, while fully appreciating the importance of the prompt lestoration of order, consider that the policy of active intervention suggested by Mr. Marling is open to objection. On the other hand, they have adopted a suggestion put forward by His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, who has recently been in London on leave of absence. Sir George Barclay suggested that the Persian Government should be informed that if they fail to restore order on the southern trade routes by the end of September His Majesty’s Government will feel obliged to insist on the formation of a force of 1,000 or 1,200 men, analogous to the Cossack Brigade, for the protection of the roads. This force would be levied and officered by eight or ten officers of the Indian army, lent for the purpose by the Government of India. * Mr. Marling, No. 114, July 2, paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, down to “ unsafe.” [ 2854 /- 15 ] / 7 X ^ ^[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s _ ^ ivernment.J PERSIA. ^CONFIDENTIAL.

REFERRING to the letter which the Manchester Chamber of Commerce forwarded to you on the 28th July'dealing with the highly unsatisfactory state of the roads in Southern Persia, we beg to address you again on this subject, as it is of the utmost importance to us and to all merchants trading with the Persian Gulf that a remedy be speedily found to put an end to the existing state of chaos on the trade routes. _ We have for some years past been struggling under the most adverse conditions to do all in our power to maintain our trade in South Persia, buoyed up by the hope that with the advent of the new regime effective measures would be taken to ensure a return to more normal conditions. We are of course aware of the measures which were proposed last year with a view to bringing about an amelioration of the position, such as the patrolling of the roads and the payment of an additional import duty to contribute towards the necessary funds, but nothing came of all these proposals, and, far from there being any improve ment in the situation, it is an indisputable fact that matters have simply gone from bad to worse. . . _ ^ -n • The very important export trade which we formerly carried on to Northern Persia has already been entirely extinguished by the Russian advance in Azerbaijan, and we fear that, although from a different cause, the same fate will overtake British trade in South Persia unless a remedy be speedily found, security restored, and quicker and regular transport ensured on the main trade artery, the Bushire-Shiraz-Ispahan route. # . . Instead of being able to do a remunerative business as m former years, we now find ourselves confronted year after year with such formidable losses that the time has come when we have seriously to consider whether it will be possible for us to continue doing business there at all or be compelled to retire entirely from the market. The extreme gravity of the position with which we are now confronted—the seriousness of which we have in no wise overstated impels us again to appea to 3 /Ou for assistance, in the hope that some measures may even yet be taken of a nature calculated to restore confidence and revive enterprise.

Having found that notes to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and verbal representations to the Minister of Interior or Minister of War are equally useless the former being merely referred to the Medjliss Committee for Foreign Affairs and the latter met With unfulfilled promises, it seemed to me necessary to take some other means oi forcing the attention of the Government to the necessity of restoring order and I therefore, as reported in my telegram No. 281 of the 8 th July, instructed Abbas Lull Lhan, Nawab, to gam admittance to the next council of Ministers and give them clearly to understand that His Majesty’s Government could not much longer t A 0 |® rat( L tl I?

I enclose a memorandum by Abbas Null Ivhan of his interview with the Ministers, at which Musteshar-ed-Dowleh the president of the Medjhss, was also present. Abbas Kuli Khan appears to have carried out his mission with great tact, for without himself making any mention of the possibility of our sending troops, he succeeded in leaving behind him the impression that His Majestys Government may be compelled to take that course; and he did so without arousing any resentment. I have some hopes that, although it seems practically certain that the present Government will fall, the good impression will not be lost on their successors. But except under very strong pressure I am convinced that the Persian Government, whatever it may be, will do nothing. It is not that its members could not do something; if they would employ the old-fashioned means the task is not one beyond their powers, but the general sense of the Medjliss is against that course, and is even more averse from the appointment of the men whose experience, acquired under the old regime, would ensure the success of those means Even these objections might be surmounted if the Cabinet were in earnest. But unfortunately the Cabinet is much too occupied with its own internal squabbles and intrigues to look to the interests of the country, and until it receives a warning so serious that it cannot be disregarded, the same indifference to our protests 'and representations will continue. On the morning of the 10th I received a report by telegraph from Mr. Grahame the substance of which I forwarded to you in my telegram No. 282 of the same day’ that the presence of 200 to 300 Kashgais in the town and the intended departure of the governor and a considerable quantity of the troops at his disposal gave rise to some anxiety. As the Cabinet had once more tendered its resignation, I at once sent telegraphic messages to the under-secretaries at the Department of the Interior and for_ Foreign Affairs requesting that energetic measures should be taken for the maintenance of tranquillity in Ispahan; and having occasion the same afternoon to call on Musteshar-ed-Dowleh, who, though he has just resigned the presidency of the Medjliss, is certain to take some office in the new Cabinet, I spoke to him very earnestly on the deplorable state of the southern provinces, and he promised to use his influence to restore security. BY Mr. Marling s instruction I proceeded to town yesterday to speak to the Cabinet about the increasing insecurity on the roads in Southern Persia I found [2854 6—2] I have, &amp;c. CHARLES M. MARLING. Enclosure in No. 1 . Memorandum by Abbas Kidi Khan.tliG Grand Vizier in tlie Parliament building. I informed bis Excellency that I had come on the part of His Majesty’s charge d’affaires to put certain matters before the Cabinet. His Excellency ushered me into the adjacent room where all the Ministers were sitting. After the usual exchange of compliments, I asked leave to read out to them the three notes which Has Majesty’s charge d affaires had written to the Persian Foreign Office about the deplorable situation in Southern Persia. Notwithstanding their protest that they had already seen the notes, I proceeded with the reading out o^. the last note of Mr. Marling’s, dated the 6 th July. The Grand Vizier replied that if . the present state in the northern provinces were to be compared with that of last year, it would be seen how much improvement was made, but m spite of that, the Russian and British Legations were always complaining at the slightest quarrel even between two individuals. I remarked that whatever might be the state of the northern provinces, the condition of the south was such that I did not believe that it could t)e tolerated ’much longer by His Majesty’s Government, who are constantly approached by the firms and traders doing business with Persia complaining of the increased insecurity in Southern Persia. What would be the ultimate result? I enquired. Sardar Assad, Minister of War, at once replied that the Persian Government highly appreciates the friendliness hitherto shown by His Majesty’s Government in avoiding to make a military demonstration in the country. Of course, his Excellency said, 200 Indian sepoys would have restored order in Southern Persia. To show their gratitude, I said, the Persian Government should take some steps to relieve His Majesty’s Government of their anxiety by restoring order on the trade routes. Sardar Assad replied that, with regard to the Kashgai brigands near Ispahan, the Bakhtiaris have been ordered to pursue and punish them, but with regard to the disorder in Ears, a racial change in the administration of that province is indispensable, and that the Cabinet is now engaged in discussing the matter, the result of which would be communicated to His Majesty’s Legation in the form of a reply to its notes addressed to the Foreign Office on the subject. The Sardar added that when I spoke to him some time ago in support of the Soulet-ed-Dowleh he did not fail to point out to me that the Soulet was unworthy. I replied that His Majesty’s Legation has never supported Soulet or any other person, but I, in accordance with my instructions, only urged upon the Persian Government in a private and friendly manner the necessity of avoiding any conflict between the Soulet and his brother, the Zaigham-ed-Dowleh, which might lead to serious complications in the south. I may add that in the course of conversation the Grand Vizier referred to the force at the disposal of the Governor-General of Ears for the purpose of keeping order in his province. I could not help remarking that governors did not always use the force at their disposal in the right way, but sometimes for their personal interest, and that the Cabinet was, no doubt, a better judge as to whether that was the case with the present Governor-General of Ears. With regard to the trouble in the neighbourhood of Kermanshah, the Cabinet informed me that Daoud Khan had already telegraphed his allegiance to the Persian Government, and that there was no ground for any anxiety as to the safety of foreigners in that town.

In view of the serious losses incurred by British and British Indian trade in consequence of this con dition of affairs and of the inability of the Persian Government to take any effective steps to restore order, Mr. Marling proposes that he should be author ised to inform them that if by the end of September a degree of security has not been established as *yJULirl0 permit ordinary caravan traffic; to be resumed. Majesty's Government will take the duty in hand lie Under Secretary of State, India Office. themselves( 25923 / 10 ) themselves. Since this despatch was written Mr. Marling, hy his telegram No.293 of the 18th instant, copy of which has already heen forwarded to you for your in- formation, has suggested that he should he furnished with instructions to make this communication to the Persian Government immediately. I am to state that Sir E. Grey is far from under rating the importance of ensuring the prompt restora tion of order and security on the trade routes of Southern Persia, and the force of the considerations urged hy Mr. Marling in favour of the course which he proposes to take, hut that he cannot, at the same time, lose sight of the objections to v/hich a step of this kind would he open. It is clear that were His Majesty’s Government to embark on a policy of active intervention in Southern Persia and to land troops in the country not only might their withdrawal he exceedingly diffi cult, hut their presence might lead to serious politi cal(25925/1°) political complications. It would bs contain in any case greatly to retard the evacuation of Northern Persia by the Russian troops now occupying Tabriz and Kazvin even if it did not result in a virtual or actual partition of the country. I am to state that His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran who } as Viscount Morley is aware, is at present on leave of absence in this country, has been consult ed with regard to the measure proposed by Mr. Marling. Sir G. Barclay has expressed his complete con currence in the latter’s view that a strong represent ation to the Persian Government is necessary in the circumstances, but has suggested that, in view of the grave objections to which intervention on the proposed scale is open, the Persian Government should be in formed that, if they fail to restore order on the southern trade routes by the end of September, His ■ Majesty's Government will feel obliged, to insist on the formation of a force of One thousand or One thous and two hundred men, analogous to the Cossack Brigade, for( 25923 / 10 ) for the protection of the roads. This force would he levied and officered by eight or ten officers of the Indian Army,lent for the purpose by the Government of India. Sir G. Barclay calculates that this scheme could be effectively worked at a cost of about Forty thousand pounds a year, and suggests that, if the Persian Government have not by then obtained an ad vance of money from His Majesty's and the Bussian Governments or from some other source approved by them part of this sum could be provided out of the surtax of ten per cent on goods imported through the ports of the Persian Gulf which lias not yet been applied but to which the assent of the Board of Trade has already been obtained, while the Persian Government would be informed that they would be expected to furnish the remainder from the revenues of the province of Fare, which, he considers, are sufficient to support the burden which would thus be imposed on them. It appears to Sir E. Grey that the scheme here outlined( 25923 / 10 ) outlined is free from the objections which might he urged against the more drastic propose! of Mr. Marling and is, indeed, no more than a slight development of the project for the organisation of a body of road- guards originally drawn up by Mr. Bill while acting Consul at Shiraz and subsequently amplified by Sir G. Barclay himself, the only essential difference being that the force would be controlled by British military officers instead of by British telegraph officials. Mr. Bill's scheme as modified by Sir G. Barclay, :Jc’ while providing adequate protection for trade in the conditions prevailing at the time when it was drawn up is no longer fitted to cope with the more serious situ ation which has since arisen, and I am accordingly to state that Sir E. Grey would he glad to receive Lord Moriey’s observations on the more complete project now suggested. I am. Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servant,AT' A .

[25923] Mr. Marlinq to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received July 18.) (No. 114.) Sir, Gulaheh, July 2, 1910. THE number of jobberies on the high roads during the last few days point to an alarming increase in the insecurity of Persia. The European post-cart was attacked and looted at Buinek, some 20 miles from Kazvin, on the Resht road, and two cases of the same kind have been reported to me as having taken place near Kum, in one the mail from Sultanabad, and in the other the mail from Ispahan having been looted. Besides this, the Ispahan-Tehran road is rendered dangerous by the outrages committed by the notorious Naib Hussein, whose exploits, first at Kashan and now near Kum, the Government appear to be powerless to arrest, and a violent assault and robbery by armed men on some employes of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, about 7 miles east of Tehran, three days ago shows that lawlessness prevails at the very gates of the capital. Three of four cases of robbery, one of them on a caravan on the Ahwaz route, have occurred in the immediate neighbourhood of Ispahan. Of the condition of the roads between Ispahan and Shiraz and Shiraz and Bushire you are only too well aware, and the slight improvement which I was able to report appears to have been a mere pause to allow the marauding tribesmen to see whether the arrival of Zaffer-es-Sultaneh, the new Governor-General, at Shiraz meant that serious measures were about to be taken to restore order. I regret to have to report, however, that Mr. Acting Consul Smart describes his Highness as utterly incompetent, and bent only on filling his pockets, in accordance with the worst traditions of provincial rule in Persia. Mr. Consul- General Grahame’s reports of the Governor-General of Ispahan are scarcely more complimentary. Kermanshah, as I reported yesterday by telegraph, is threatened by the formidable Lur tribe of the Kalhurs, under Daoud Khan, and Nizam-es-Sultaneh, who is considered to be one of the most capable governors that Persia possesses, was so mistrustful of his ability to crush the revolt that he applied to the British and Russian consulates to endeavour to dissuade Daoud Khan from attacking the town. The state of the Yezd-Tabbas-Meshed road, on which a large British Indian caravan of over 200 camels was captured by a force of 300 Arab robbers about a month ago, is deplorable ; while, 60 or 70 miles west of Kuh-i-Malik-Siah, Afghan gun-runners are continually breaking up the Indo-European Telegraph Department’s central Persian line, and have made it necessary for the English employes on the line to fly for safety to Robat. Thus, practically all the chief routes used by British trade are more or less unsafe. I have lost no opportunity of urging on the Persian Government, both verbaily and in writing, the paramount importance of taking energetic measures to put an end to this state of affairs, and I propose to bring it to the notice of the president of the Medjliss. I fear, however, that representations will be useless. The Government is quite alive to the situation, but it has neither money nor men. Under the old system a provincial governor kept order on the roads by putting each section under the care of a local headman, who was held responsible for its security, and if a case of robbery occurred the governor sent a handful of his retainers to exact a fine from the negligent official, and by this rough and ready system an energetic governor maintained security without much expense. But these primitive measures were displeasing to the Medjliss, and have been abolished in favour of a regularly organised force of road guards. Unfortunately, however, the road guards do not exist, or, in the few places where there is a pretence of such a force, the men afe unpaid, and naturally, in those circumstances, nothing efficient can be expected. The Treasury seems to be in desperate straits, so much so that, when the Minister of the Court applied for 20,000 tomans to allow him to pay some of the arrears due to [2824 s—l]the household, so as to induce them to face the extra expense of moving into the country with the Shah, only 10,000 tomans was promised, and it is probable that His Imperial Majesty will he obliged to spend the whole of the summer in Tehran. I am told that the deficit for the last two years is estimated by the Minister of f inance at 17 crores of tomans, or rather more than. 1,500,000L To a great extent, the disorders in the provinces are only the counterpart of the chaos that exists in the Government at Tehran. The Cabinet itself is hopelessly divided ; intrigue is as rampant as ever; Ministers interfere in each other’s depart ments, and in the departments themselves there is no organisation or system, and the feeble efforts that are occasionally made to reform them are constemtly thwarted by self-interest and ignorance ; the Medjliss complains that the Ministers disregard its wishes, and the Ministers that the Medjliss hampers their work, and both that the maleficent influence of the clergy is the root of half the trouble. The prospect of obtaining money in the near future is small. A necessary preliminary to any financial operation—except with the two Powers is, of course, the conclusion of an agreement for the consolidation and service of the Government’s debts to the Russian Bank, and the Persian Government are showing little disposition to push forward the negotiations for this purpose. But, supposing that this difficulty is surmounted, there still remains the question of security for an advance, whether from the two Powers or from other sources. For an advance of so small an amount as 400,000L security can be found, but there will be considerable haggling before any arrangement is reached, for, thanks to the ill-considered offers made by such persons as Mr. Cohen, Mr. Osborne, and Mr. Moore, the Persian Government have the most inflated ideas of the country’s credit. There is, of course, the possibility that the projected internal loan will meet with a measure of success, but no one who is acquainted with the country has any faith in it, and the present state of insecurity is not calculated to reassure the native public. In such conditions the probability of the restoration of order on the southern roads in a reasonable period is slight, and I venture to suggest that the time has come when it is necessary to intimate clearly to the Persian Government that the prolonged interruption of British trade is intolerable, and that His Majesty’s Government will have to consider what measures they can take themselves to put a stop to it. The circumstances not only warrant, but demand, extremely plain speaking, if we are to bring it home to the ruling classes in Persia that they must put their house in order. For this purpose I would propose that the Persian Government should be informed that if, by the end of September, such a degree of security has not been established on the main trade routes in the south as to permit ordinary caravan traffic to be resumed, His Majesty’s Government will take the duty in hand themselves. I am quite aware that a threat of this kind has less significance when coming from us than when made by Russia, for the simple reason that the Persians are quite certain that our troops would be withdrawn as soon as their work was accomplished. On the other hand, it w r ould, for just the same reason, be proportionately less resented. It would serve to bring the Persians to a sense of the deplorable failure which has hitherto attended the experiment of self-government. It would stimulate the few who realise that, until European assistance, in the shape of advisers and instructors, is enlisted, no progress towards reform and reorganisation is possible to enforce their views ; it would bring the Government and Medjliss face to face with their desperate financial position, to wdiich at present they appear resolved to shut their eyes It is quite possible that, under pressure of a threat of this kind, the Persian Government will find means to restore order. The successful efforts of Yeprim in Azerbaijan show wdiat can be achieved when sufficient pressure is applied, and, now that Teprim has arrived in Tehran, his services might be used with equally good effect in Fars.

In the matter ot keeping in intimate touch with this Consulate General,Mr Bill tully maintained the pol icy tor the institution and pursuit or whicft I and my predecessor always had so much reason to he grateful to Mr George Grahame,and his periodical communications to me as regards Pars affairs showed,to my mind,that he had / acquired a sound grip of the politilual problems affecting the Pars Province and our interests In Southern Persia generally. As regards the performance of his practical Consular duties,the many expressions of regret which have reached me in connection with his departure from Shiraz themake it clear that he has earned an excellent reputation with the British mercantile community with which he has been thrown,as a thoroughly efficient Consular Officer who has looked after their commercial interests and rights as .British subjects in a vigourous and persevering manner of which all speak appreciatively. Since handing over his duties at Shiraz,Hr Bill has shown by his bearing during his encounter with Kuhgelu robbers on the way to Isfahan,that he can be depended upon to render a good account of himself in directions apart from the ordinary routine duties of a Consular post. As far as I am in a position to judge,therefore, I think Hr Bill's record at Shiraz has been a most cred itable one and have litule doubt that His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires,to whom I am forwarding a copy of this com- municationjWill b© disposed to agree with me, I have the honour to be, &amp;c, (signed) Fj Z, Cox.

I should be reluctant to send cavalry to Shiraz at the present moment, when we are urging withdrawal of Russian troops. You should inform the Persian Government that we cannot tolerate a continuance of outrages on European officials, and claim compensation of 5,000 tomans each for the murder of the two sowars. You should point out that, as they have refused the advance, they cannot plead want of funds for properly policing the roads, and that we shall expect them to make immediate arrangements to that end. Sardar Assad has disclaimed any hostility to Soulet-ed-Dowleh, and, as I gather that he could be of great assistance, you should insist on the Government giving him wide powers. In the meantime British consular officers should travel as little as possible, and when it is unavoidable that they should do so, they should take as large an escort as can be spared.

Barclay’s telegram No. 176. Consuls agree that, short of occupation of roads, no measure we can take will prevent absolutely repetition of such cases. I doubt whether Persian Government can take effective action to restore security on the roads except by giving wide powers to Soulet, a course which Sardar Assad’s animosity to him renders extremely improbable. In any case we cannot tolerate this second outrage on a European official without taking some overt action, and I would recommend the proposal made b} Cox, viz., that a squadron of cavalry with British officers be stationed at Shiraz, which he thinks would suffice to give reasonable protection to our officials. Or the force might be stationed half at Shiraz and half at Ispahan. I would further suggest that to stimulate the Persian Government I be authorised to state that, unless security of the roads is established within six weeks, His Majesty’s Government will have to consider whether they themselves must undertake the task. As regards compensation, I submit that we can scarcely make a less claim than did the Russian Government for the two Cossacks killed in the Passek outrage, viz., 5,000 tomans each.

He fed been forced to take this step as the Central Government had quite failed to support him, and his position had become a mere sinecure. They had also ordered him to dismiss most of his officials as they could not, afford to pay them, Soulet-ed-Douleh (the chief of the Qashgai) had also defied him in his official capacity as Governor General, and avoided transacting business through him with the object of establishing direct communication with the Centra] Government, As the Governor hid no troops he could rfo nothing and the authorities at Teheran did nothing to support him. On the 20th January the Governor Genera] had a talk with the Teheran authorities over the telegraph and again tendered his resignation. This was again refused. On the 21st (the eve of ’‘Qat]” one of the greatest of Shi Muhammadan festivals) several of the local Mullahs and others sent a telegram to the Centra] Government urging them to accept the Governor General’s resignation and representing that the populace were so incensed against him that if he remained there would certainly be sanguinary riots The * T ■ {) : // JA The Central Governinent thereupon ^ave In to them, and telegraphed acceptir^g Sahanned-Douleh’s resignation, and appointed iokhateb-ed-Douleh the telegraph-mster (who was one of the signatories to the telegram) Deputy Governor. Saham-ed-Douleh the late Governor General has not yet left for Teheran but does so in the oourse of a few days. Up to the present a new Governor General has not been appointed, and it is probable that they will hive the greatest difficulty in filling up the post. For the present the town is quiet. A mob, under the pretext of a religious procession, went round the town after the resignation hid been accepted and pulled down the gallows which had been erected by the late Governor-General (and used with marked effect) and compelled the release of three suspected murderers. Mails from Bushire are coming in very irregularly, the two which came in yesterday are the first for some weeks, and letters received by them for the detachment are those despatched from London dated December 23rd whilst those of December 16th from London have not yet been received.

Sir, at * * * Your memorandumdated Bombay 16th Oeoember only arrived here on the 8th instant, this bein^ the first mail we have received for over a fortnight. Mails and paravans are coming in very irregularly. From the 24th November (when the caravan of the Russian Consul-General was attacked) until about a fortnight ago Shitaz was entirely cut off from Bushire by road, robbers, of the Boir Ahmedi tribe, having taken up a strong position, prevented any caravans attempting to come through. This state of affairs only terminated by severe rain and snow storms driving the robbers off the road. The snow, however, made the pass over Mian Kotal impossible for some days, consequently several caravans which made a dash from Kazarun to try and get through to Shiraz when they heard that storms had driven the robbers off the road, could not get beyond Mian Kotal and as the locality is very bad it is presumed that they returned to Kazarun. Information, however, on tne subject is very scarce and untrustworthy. Very heavy rain and snow storms have been exper ienced here since the beginning of the year. On January 4-5th rain fell continuously for 27 hours registering over 3i inches. On January 5th the river, which was dry at 9.0 a.m. was in full flood by 1 ;.3Q a.m., and burst its banks, flooding the place and turning the Bushire road between thethe Consulate and the town into a swirt flowing river. Several houses and walls were washed down and much valuable property ruined, all crops in the neighbourhood of the breach were entirely washed away. The only casualties reported so far are two men drowned. The state of affairs here is quite unsettled. Trade is at a stand still. The (lOvernmsnt for want of money is absolutely unable to cope with the situation and the Governor General of Pars is reported to be giving up office owing to the Central Government being unable to give him any support. If, and when, this happens, the situation may again become critical. x * * s x Signed GEORGE H.LANG, Lieutenant, Royal Navy. le Commanding Officer, H.M.S. “Sphinx 1 ', BOMBAY.Immediate and Confidential. \ y v w .no'.alOIS The Under - Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs presents his compliments to the Under-Secret ary of State for India, and is directed by the Secretary of State to transmit the accompanying copies of ex telegram , as marked in the margin.

[8503] No. 1. Board of Trade to Foreign Office.—(Received March 11.) Sir, Board of Trade, Whitehall, March 9, 1910. I AM directed by the Board of Trade to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th February with further reference to the question of the provision of guards for the protection of trade on the roads in Southern Persia. In reply, I am to point out that there appears to be some misconception as to the views of the Board as indicated in their letter of the 14th February. It was not suggested in that letter that a surtax of 10 per cent, on the duties at Bushire alone would suffice to cover more than the cost of carrying out the scheme of Mr. Acting Consul Bill, and the statement made in paragraph 3 of the Board’s earlier letter of the 28th December last was expressly based upon that scheme. Since Sir E. Grey regards Mr. Bill’s scheme as superseded by the [proposals contained in Sir G. Barclay’s telegram of the 6th November last, the Board recognise that the cost of carrying out these proposals could not be met by the imposition of the surtax at Bushire alone, and they concur in Sir E. Grey’s view that it would be necessary to arrange for the imposition of the surtax at all the ports in Southern Persia in order to provide the requisite funds for the adoption of these wider proposals. As therefore Sir E. Grey is of opinion that under all the circumstances Sir G. Barclay’s proposals are preferable to the more limited scheme to which the Board’s previous letters have referred, they will not press further their objections to the imposition of the surtax at'all the ports. I am to add that, as intimated in the Board’s letter of the 14th February, they are inclined to doubt whether any useful purpose would be served by further discussion with interested firms, from whom continued opposition is to be anticipated.

I AM dir6cted by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to acknowledge tbe receipt of your letter of tbe l M4th instant, on the subject of the provision of guards for the protection of trade on the roads of Southern Persia. I am to observe that Sir E. Grey regards the scheme suggested by the British acting consul at Shiraz, to which reference is made in the second paragraph of your j \ letter, as superseded by the proposals contained in the telegram from His Majesty’s lof&gt;i Minister at Tehran, Nof t 772 of the 6th November last, communicated to you in Sir F. Campbell’s letter of the 16th November, which, as you will have observed, are, in the opinion of Sir G. Barclay himself, and also in that of His Majesty’s consul- general at Bushire, and of the local representative of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, less open to objection than Mr. Bill’s project. The annual cost of working the later scheme is calculated at about 15,00(P., and the figures in Sir E. Grey’s possession show, as already stated, that the imposition of a surtax of 10 per cent, at Bushire alone would not produce a sum sufficient to defray this expense. 1 ^ „ ... In this connection I am to refer you to the letter of the 13th October last iiom this Office, enclosing copy of a despatch from Sir G Barclay, which gives a comparative &gt;A statement of the customs receipts from the Southern Persian ports for the financial ^ 'years 1907-8 and 1908-9, and for the first six months of the financial year 1909-10 ^ (the 21st March-21st September, 1909). It will be seen that for the financial year 1908-9 the total customs receipts irom all these ports amounted to 8,231,563*55 krans (about 164,631/.) and those from Bushire alone to 5,094,019*85 krans (about 101,880/.) If these figures be taken as the basis of calculation, the surtax on the customs at all the ports would suflice to meet the estimated cost of the scheme of protection, while that at Bushire alone W0Ul The°figures for the first six months of 1909-10, however, show a considerable decrease from those realised in former years, and if they are used as a 110 evei ^ the yield of the surtax at all the ports would meet the object with which it is propose It would not, in Sir E. Grey’s opinion, be safe to assume that, m the continued absence of any system of protection for trade, this decrease will be checked, and it is indeed more likely to be increased. If, however, such a system is promptly put in working order, a sufficient degree of improvement may be expecte o mam es i se to allow the expense involved to be met by the surtax if applied a a P 01 I am to state that Sir E.

[5355] No. 1. Board of Trade to Foreign Office.—{Received February 15.) Sir, ’ Board of Trade, February 14, 1910. WITH reference to your letter of the 28th January and to previous correspon dence on the subject of the provision of road-guards in Southern Persia, I am directed hy the Board of Trade to state, for the information of Sir E. Grey, that the Board will have no objection to approaching interested British firms in the manner suggested in the last paragraph of your letter under reply. They doubt, however, whether they are likely to be successful in removing the objections indicated in the letter from this department of the 28th December, unless they are able to place those firms in posses sion of some new facts bearing upon the matter with which at present the Board are not acquainted. The Board are unable to reconcile the figures in their possession with the view stated in your letter to be held by Sir G. Barclay and Major Cox, to the effect that the imposition of a surtax of 10 per cent, at Bushire alone would be insufficient to provide the necessary funds for the provision of the suggested road-guards, unless they are to understand that a limited scheme such as that suggested by Mr. Acting Consul Bill in his despatch of the 1st September is now considered to be out of the question. The Board would have been disposed to expect, on the one hand, that the improved security of the roads from Bushire would counterbalance the cost of the small increase of duty on goods imported through that port, and so would prevent any diversion of trade; and, on the other, that the improvement of facilities solely at Bushire out of the proceeds of a tax levied on imports at all South Persian ports would tend to divert trade from the other ports to Bushire. In view, however, of the fact that their knowdedge of local conditions is necessarily imperfect, the Board do not desire to press their objection to the surtax being levied at all the South Persian ports, should Sir E. Grey think it desirable, on the balance of considerations, to give his consent. In that event, however, it seems to be a question whether it would not be advisable for such consent to be given without any renewal of a discussion with the interested firms, from whom continued opposition may be anticipated. 1 am, &amp;e.

The Board of Trade are aware, from the letter of the 5th November from this Office, that on the 23rd September last His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, under instruc tions from Sir E. Grey, made renewed representations to the Persian Government on this subject, which, however, owing to the impotence of the administration, have produced no useful result. It appears to Sir E. Grey that, as the Persian Government are still quite unable to take any effective steps to put a stop to these exactions, which are, of course, entirely illegal, nothing is to be gained by making a renewed protest against them at this moment, and that the present situation must continue till the proposed force of guards for the protection of trade on these roads has been formed and is in working order.

Whitworth House, Princess Street, Manchester, Sir, January 24, 1910. WE have just received from Persia a press copy of a statement furnished by them [sic] to the British residency in Bushire. This statement shows the amounts that are being exacted from muleteers carrying British goods, in the shape of tolls. The Tufangchees are road guards, and the tolls are paid them for guarding the roads, which they do not do. Our object in sending this to you is to point out that these road guards, who are not paid any wages by the Persian Government, are already taking from muleteers more than it is proposed to charge under the new system of road patrols suggested to us recently, when your Mr. Hooper called upon us. Although these tolls are paid by the muleteers, it is needless to say that they are added to the rate of mule-hire, and the British importer has to pay them. We have, &amp;c. H. C. DIXON and Co.

WITH reference to previous correspondence relative to the formation of a body of guards for the protection of the roads in Southern Persia ending with my letter of the 11 th instant, I am directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to inform you that the proposal of the Board of Trade that the surcharge of 10 per cent, on import duties, which is to provide the sum necessary to defray the expenses of putting the scheme into execution, should be levied at the port of Bushire only, has been carefully con sidered in this Department in communication with His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, and that it appears to him to be open to serious objections. In the first place, the sum derived from the imposition of this charge on Bushire alone would, in the opinion of Sir G. Barclay and of His Majesty’s consul-general at Bushire, who is now on leave in this country, be insufficient for the purpose for which it is intended. Sir G. Barclay has even expressed the view that to obtain the necessary sum at Bushire the charge would have to be doubled. In these circumstances, if the charge were levied as proposed, trade would at once he diverted from Bushire to other ports where it was not imposed, with the result that the trade of Bushire would be, temporarily at any rate, destroyed, and that the port would soon cease to produce any money to defray the expenses connected with the guards. Sir E. Grey is well aware that the extension of the charge to all the ports in the Persian Gulf would be likely to be strenuously opposed by British firms who have commercial interests in those regions. He is nevertheless of opinion that a serious effort should be made to overcome that opposition, and he would suggest that it might be pointed out to objectors that it is worth their while to make the sacrifice involved in agreement to the universal application of the charge, since such a course could not fail to produce a great and immediate improvement in the trade done by British and British-Indian firms in Southern Persia, whereas its rejection must result before long in the total extinction of that branch of commerce.

WITH reference to Mr. Hooper’s visit, the undersigned have heard with much satisfaction that serious proposals are now being discussed between the Persian Government and His Majesty’s Government for the formation of an efficient patrol for the Bushire-Ispahan road ; they hereby express their willingness to submit to a surtax of 10 per cent, on the present duties for a period of three years on the under standing that the revenue so raised shall be under the control of, and administered by, His Majesty’s resident and consul-general in Bushire. and be used solely for the purpose of maintaining order on this road ; and the surtax shall be removed as soon as its object of securing safety and order has been achieved. We would further direct the attention of His Majesty’s Government to the fact that, in recent years, caravan robberies on a very large scale have taken place, and certain tribes have made a regular and profitable business of stopping and lobbing caravans, and they have now Manchester bales stored in their forts sufficient for theii use for several years to come. _ _ r j -u tj- Claims for the losses so incurred have from time to time been put forward by His Majesty’s Legation in Tehran, but probably for want of funds have so far not been met by the Persian Government. Now that a new loan is being negotiated it is hoped that immediate payment of these claims will be insisted upon, and we would also suggest that the Persian Government should be encouraged and urged to dispatch one or more punitive expeditions against the offending tribes with the view of exacting restitution of the stolen property, and damages and indemnities, and of destroying the strong holds. The moral effect of such action would be of immense value. It would make the question of restitution by other offending tribes a comparatively easy matter, won greatly facilitate the work of the road-guards, and probably make an end, once lor ail, of a system that has most seriously hampered trade and greatly injured traders interests for a long time past. . . It will be apparent that if the robber tribes find that, as opportunity occurs, they can plunder caravans and retire to their strongholds to enjoy undisturbed the Irmts ot their robberies, the new road-guards to be instituted will be continually open o a ac s on the part of these brigands ; but if it is known that punishment will overtake tkem (even though delayed), then we feel sure that the work of the road-guards will be made much lighter. , , ^ We earnestly hope that this matter will be very strongly urged upon the attention of the Persian Government, and that all the necessary assistance will be accorded to it.

The Assembly .—The Ministerial programme, which was presented to the Medjliss on the 30th November, was formally agreed to at the sitting of the 7 th December, when all the Cabinet Ministers attended. The Assembly, however, availed itself of the \ opportunity to remind the Ministers of their obligation to consult Parliament in all matters of finance. After considerable discussion, the Assembly, on the 15th instant, decided by a vote of the majority to allow the Government mint to make contracts for the minting of silver to the value of 400,000L During the past month the Assembly has been chiefly occupied preparing new internal regulations, ’which were read for the third time on the 28th instant. Secret sittings of the House have been very frequent, and it is understood that the subject discussed at these meetings has been principally concerning the pay to be allotted to the deputies. It is stated that the deputies are to receive 100 tomans (20Z.) a-month each, and that they have in fact already drawn one month’s pay. _ The Press. —The Tehran press continues to attack the Russians at every available opportunity. Financial Difficulties. —The Government applied on the 13th instant to the British and Russian Legations for a joint advance of 500,000Z., and is still awaiting a reply. G. P. CHURCHILL. Tabreez, 1. His Majesty’s acting consul-general returned to Tabreez from Soujboulak on the 18th December. 2. Tabreez has remained undisturbed, but fighting has taken place near Sarah between a force of tribesmen under the son of Rahim Khan and the Government troops under Sardar Assad’s son and Yefraim, in wdiich the latter are reported to have been successful. Astarabad. 1. Our agent reports that Salar Moktader,. Ilkhani, who was with the Ilghi Turko mans, was, in the middle of November, summoned by the Governor of Astarabad. He sent a message to the Russian consul asking for assurances for himself. The latter replied that he could not give assurances until he had seen the governor, but if he then failed to give them, Salar Moktader should either go to Russia or collect the Turko mans and plunder the country, in which case he would receive his (the consul’s) support. A later report states that Salar Moktader died on his way to Tehran. [2582 r—4]2. Towards the end of November two Russian officers, with Russian flags, visited the Turkoman tribes and encouraged them to plunder. The Government reported the matter to Tehran. Meshed. 1. Major Sykes returned from a tour to Nishapur, Turshiz, and Turbat on the 29th November^oung p ersians » f rom Tehran reached Meshed early in December, three of them being appointed assistant governor-general, chef de cabinet, and head of the police respectively. They at first decided on a policy of sweeping reforms, including the dismissal of the governor-general, but later they modified their views, and, adopting a moderate policy, are doing good work. In Major Sykes opinion, if the machinery can be kept working without fresh crises for^ the next few months, the situation will undoubtedly improve, but it appears that Prince Dabija is determined to prevent all reforms. 3. Munsur-ul-Mulk has been dismissed from the governorship of Daragez and Nusrat-ul-Mamalik appointed in his place. The Russian consul-general has informed the governor-general that this appointment does not meet with his approval nor with that of the authorities in Transcaspia. 4. A municipal octroi has been started. A notice was sent to both consulates, in which it was announced that this was being levied as at flehran. His Majesty s consul-general contented himself with asking whether this octroi was exactly the same in every respect as that at Tehran, but his Russian colleague gave a veiy harsh reply to the effect that if levied on Russian subjects he would stop it by force. Major Sykes says it is hopeless for the Russian Government to expect the Persians to view their acts with anything but mistrust and dislike so long as they continue to be represented by such officials as Prince Dabija. Turbat-i-HaidarL 1. The following movements of Russian Cossacks are reported :— On the 13th November seven arrived from Bunder Abbas for Russia ; six of the local consular escort left on the 16th November for Pul-i-Khatun; on the 25th November six arrived from Birjand and twenty from Seistan for Russia. 2. Captain Skourratt, the Russian military attache at Meshed, arrived here on the 3rd December. Seistan. 1 . The chief difficulty in Seistan seems to be over the revenue question. The local Foreign Office agent and the deputy-governor are pressing the Baluch sardars for last year’s arrears as well as this year’s dues, and the sardars are doing all they can to delay full settlement. Purdil Khan and Khudadad Khan both spoke to Major O’Connor on the subject and used threatening language with reference to the Persian officials. Major O’Connor urged them to give their loyal support to the new Government, and pointed out that the demand for revenue was just and reasonable. Major O’Connor thinks that there is no present prospect of their attempting to create any serious trouble. 2. During October 1,783 patients were treated by the hospital assistant in the hospital at Birjand. Ispahan. 1 . The town has continued quiet. The party of Kuhgeluis reported in last summary to be holding a position commanding the road at Orchini withdrew on the 3rd December, but returned on the 7th, and a band of them was engaged in indiscriminate plundering round Kumisheh. Repeated representations to Samsam-es- Sultaneh by the British and Russian consuls drew replies that forces would be sent, but there is good reason to believe that no force is likely to go, it being hoped that when snow falls the tribesmen will withdraw. On the 12th December they were still at Orchini. On the Tehran road the post was robbed 6 miles north of Kum by Shahsavan tribesmen, all valuable parcels being carried off. A robbery was reported on the Sultanabad road. The AKwaz road is reported safe.2. Samsam-es-Sultaneh left Ispahan for Tehran on the 23rd December and reached Tehran on the 29th. Mnntazem-ed-Dowleh officiates as governor during his absence. ^ Yezd, The town continues quiet. The governor is stated to have amassed a large sum of money since his arrival, many offenders escaping punishment by the payment of money. The Kerman road continues safe, but there are still robbers on the Nain road. The Parsees, though not receiving much assistance from the governor, dread his probable departure in March, when they fear their persecution may recommence. Trade is recovering slowly from its extended period of depression. Taxes, rather more excessive than before, are being collected, and are coming in freely. Sultanabad. Mr. Vice-Consul Strauss reports that on the 6 th November an influential resident of Ravendge, in the Mahallat district, named Aga Sadr, was murdered, as was his twelve year old son, by order of the governor. Both were shot in their house by a Caucasian, Mehdi Khan, who was accompanied by Karim Khan, the old enemy of Messrs. Ziegler’s murdered agent, Ali Khan, and six of the governor’s escort. Kermanshah. The state of the town is far from satisfactory, robberies being of frequent occurrence, Zahir-ed-Dowleh resigned the governorship at the end of November, and Nizan-es-Sultaneh was appointed in his stead, but has not yet assumed the governorship. The Bagdad road has been fairly safe, but on all other roads numerous robberies are reported. The telegraph line has been repeatedly interrupted, several miles of line having been destroyed, and much material carried away by marauding Kakawend tribesmen. Latest advices, however, show that the roads from Kermanshah are now clear. Ramadan. 1 2 3 1. The agent of the Russian Bank has been appointed vice-consul, and flies the flag on his house daily. 2. Five Jews, being pressed for 16,000/. due by them to certain Turkish merchants of Bagdad, took refuge with the Russian agent, who sent two Cossacks to tell the local authorities that they had no business to interfere with persons under Russian protection. All five men were Persian subjects. 3. The governor of Hamadan was dismissed about the 15th December. The district was then reported quiet. Kerman. 1. M. Petroff arrived on the 11th November with six Cossacks to relieve M. Adamoff as Russian vice-consul. The latter left on the 30th November for xezd. 2. The town and district have remained quiet. The governor has organised a force which keeps order and has also recovered a certain amount of goods plundered from caravans. The Baluchis, who were thought to intend raiding the Narmashir district, have made no move. Shiraz. The governor-general maintains his authority with considerable difficuhy, while the attitude of Soulet-ed-Dowleh is defiant. The Central Government has authorised the governor-general to keep part of the local revenue for the purpose of maintaining order. The roads continue disturbed. Persian Gulf. Bushire. 1.

Herr Wassmuss, the German vice-consul at Bushire, left Nasiri to visit the oil-fields without informing the Oil Company’s agent, and after repeatedly assuring His Majesty’s consul and other persons in Mohammerah that he had no intention of visiting the fields. He arrived at the oil-fields one morning, and met with a very cold reception from the oil-field’s staff, who had been previously warned by special messenger; he was asked to show his introduction from the managing agents and his card, but was in possession of neither. He remained about three hours, saw one workshop, but no oil-wells, and eventually returned by the same route as he had come by looking very disconsolate.” C. B. STOKES, Major, Military Attache. 1.

A You will have seen from my telegrams Nos. 803 and 813 of the 5th and 16th instant respectively that, although when we made representations m the sense desired by the two consuls, the Persian Government expressed their entire agreement, they have evidently thought it better to temporise with this powerful chief; and however little this course may recommend itself to Mr. Bill and M.

BARCLAY. Enclosure in No. 1. Memorandum by Acting Consul Bill respecting Shiraz News for week ending December 1, 1909. THE week has been a very eventful one. At 6 p m. on the 24 th a telephone message was received from the telegraph gholam at Dastarjm to the 1 *hole caravans accompanying the Russian consul-general had / en t A wtar aAollm of party carried off. While Mr. Bill was writing this new s to g ’ Tinian the Russian consulate arrived, together with a Persian Cossack from Khaneh /in with a pencilled note from M. Passek, and a letter from the five stated that he had had a sharp fight with robbers, an a on , , pj e as k er | for men wounded. (This was a slip ; the number of wounded was three^) He asked ior medical assistance. After arranging with Dr. Woollatt to AlYh“e escort should be provided, Mr. Bill went to see the governor g issued for all the news, asking at the same time that orders should be immediate^ ^ued^toral^the available Cossacks to accompany him and the doctor to Khaneh Zi [2582 c—4]was at once arranged, and the Governor also telegraphed to Kazerun directing that a force of 300 tufangchis from there, 300 from Kamanj, 300 from Khist and bhabancara, and 200 soldiers of Mansur-es-Sultaneh’s and the Mamasenni detachment should collected at once to surround the robbers. The party escorting the doctor left abol!. - midnight, with the object of reaching Khaneh Ziman as soon as it should be light enough to approach the place with proper precautions. It consisted of His Majestys consul, Dr. Woollatt, a volunteer in the person of Mr. Livingstone, twelve sowars of the consular escort, and twenty Persian Cossacks under two officers. The behaviour of the sowars through this trying and extremely cold march was excellent. At Khaneh Zinian (6,300 feet) the cold was so severe that a running rivulet outside the caravanserai was frozen over, but the men continued scouting eneigetically all the way. The behaviour of the Persian Cossacks also was good, but they complained a good deal of the cold and were inclined to lag a little. No sign of robbers was seen on the road, and on arrival at Khaneh Zinian it was found that they had gone^ apparently straight off with their booty. The caravanserai was full of pilgrims, wailing ovei their losses, and cursing the Persian Government and the local authorities. They surrounded Mr. Bill, begging him to get their goods back, and several asked why we did not take the road into our own hands and make it, as one traveller observed, “ like Bombay.” . .. The wounded were found able to travel, after surgical attention, and a telephone message was sent to Shiraz for tc kajawahs” and everything necessary. _ The whole party was brought m on the 26th, the march being made with great caution and the country well scouted. No sign of robbers was seen. 4 The scene of the attack was a section of the road lying in the wide and stony bed of the Kara Agatch Biver, about 2 miles from Khaneh Zinian. The caravan was a very large one, estimated by M. Passek to contain 200 mules. There was a good deal of merchandise—chiefly carpets, tragacanth, and opium—and a large crowd of pilgrims, who had been waiting the opportunity to travel, as they thought, m safety. At the moment of the first attack the head of the caravan had nearly reached the point where the road leaves the river bed, about 4 miles from Khaneh Zinian, and the extreme rear, which was brought up by the Bussian party, was jnst reaching the bridge, about 2 miles out. The whole of the intervening space was crowded with mules, donkeys, and travellers on foot. r ihe first volley was fired by concealed robbers at the head of the caravan, which was guarded by Haji Khairullah, the kadkhuda of Khaneh Zinian, with fifteen tufangchis and six Persian infantry soldiers. Haji Khairullah was well known for courage, and it was the evident object of the robbers to get him out of the way at the first discharge. They were successful, for he fell at the first shot, and his tufangchis took no further part in the fighting. The next object was to cut off the Bussian party in the rear and prevent them from coming to the assistance of the caravan. The robbers consequently concentrated their fire on M. Passek’s party, bring on them from both sides of the river. For several minutes they were under a very hot fire and were forced to take cover under the overhanging bank of the actual watercourse of the Kara Agatch. Abandoning the road, they worked their way gradually back to Khaneh Zinian, under fire all the time. Two horses were killed on the road, and one man killed and one wounded as they were descending into the river. At the time of the first attack a pilgrim said, in the hearing of the Bussian consulate gholam, that he saw Mohamed Ali Khan Kashguli. The four Persian Cossacks fell back on the Bussian party fighting bravely; two of them were wounded close by the bridge. The Cossacks were sent out after everything became quiet and brought in the dead body. No satisfactory evidence of the perpetrators was obtainable in Khaneh Zinian. The villagers declared unanimously that the robbers were Boir Ahmadi, but this is discounted by the fact that this tribe is a distant one, and the tribe itself is of much less importance than the Kashgai. The governor-general’s opinion is that the robbers came from various tribes, including the Kashguli. The force summoned by the governor-general amounted at the end of the week to about 200 men and one gun, collected at Mian Khotal, and urgently demanding money and instructions. One body, from Kamarij, was starting when they had to divert their attention to one of their own villages, which was attacked by Kashgai. Latest news states that their leader, Mullah Khursid, is besieged by Kashgai in Kamarij. In any case, there can be no doubt that if Soulet-ed-Dowleh did not actively instigate the affair, it had his sympathy and support owing to the friendship of Nasr-ed-Dowleh with the Bussians.The body of the Russian Cossack was buried on the 27th at the Armenian church with full military honours. M. Passek entrusted the organisation of the procession ^ to lieutenant Lang, R.N., who made admirable arrangements. The whole of the British detachment formed an escort round the gun carriage, and the whole Persian garrison was in attendance. The coffin was carried through the narrow street by British marines and Russian Cossacks, and the firing party over the grave consisted of three marines, five Russian Cossacks, and four Persian Cossacks, the whole under the British sergeant. The governor-general accompanied the cortege half-way to the church, a proceeding by which he has incurred some odium among the more fanatical portion of the population, and the karguzar was present throughout the ceremony. The Russian consul-general entertained the native troops of the British detachment on their return from the ceremony, and the Cossacks entertained the marines on the following day, the marines returning the compliment at the consulate on the 1 st. Two attempts to disturb the peace of the town were made during the week. On the 27 th the pilgrims robbed in the Russian caravan came in a crowd to the Govern ment House and obstructed the governor-general, who was starting for the funeral of the Russian Cossack. They surrounded his Excellency, demanding the return of their goods, and asking why he accepted the post if he was not able to carry out his duties. Eventually they abused him in most improper terms, and an attempt to raise a riot seems to have been made, the crowds running through the streets near the Ark with cries of “Ya Ali,” &amp;c. There was no great response, and the crowd gradually On the same evening a crowd came to the palace accompanying the body of a man who had just been shot near the Kazerun Gate. They declared that he was shot improperly by a policeman. The enquiry was postponed to the following day. _ Next morning a large armed crowd gradually collected round the body, which was m the inner courtyard, near the governor-general’s private apartments. They loudly deman ed the immediate execution of the alleged culprit. The governor-general replied that he could execute no man without proof, and referred them to the bhara Court Ihey refused to take the order, and a scene of great confusion ensued during which, after several shots had been fired, the governor escaped from the palace. Ihe karguzar and Nasr-ed-Dowleh went on foot to the latter’s quarter to collect men After a short interval, during which the governor-general’s private apartments were plundered e mob. Saham-ed-Dowleh re-entered the palace, a few shots were fired into the air by the Cossacks from a tower commanding the courtyard, and the whole crowffi bolted like rabbits, even abandoning the corpse. ,. , A HisMaiesty’s consul, on the sound of firing, went to the Russian consulate and discussed the situation with M. Passek, with special reference to the safety of Russian subjects in the town. M. Kadloubovsky had already left to investigate the position and Mr. Bill followed him, accompanied by Lieutenant Lang. He found everything at the Government House perfectly normal and the governor-genera jus ms mg 11110 • He made light of the whole affair, declaring that he could have put an end to the whole business whenever he pleased, as he had the Cossacks within cal, but that he saw that the object of the affair was to make him fire on the crowd and give a pretext for a general riot. This is very probably true, but there can be no doubt a volley fared in the air, as soon as theNowd assumed a threatening attitude, would have dispersed them without trouble and without the heavy loss of prestige which governo general has undoubtedly suffered. For the moment the a air is m a eyan PP ^ Because Nasr-ed-Dowleh has warned the relatives of the deceased not to lenphemsel es to agitators, and has backed his warning with money and threats But the afta clearly demonstrated the helplessness of the present a minis ra 10 . „ prolonged discussion on the situation between the governor-genera an i , Lwleh in Mr. Bill’s presence, as a result of which a strong telegram to Tehran was M, IWk, M, Bin M.

Meanwhile, they were prepared to send a joint telegram to Tehran, in support of whatever demands the governor-general might make which should appear to them reasonable. In all this their action was purely unofficial and they requested his Excellency to take note that as long as circumstances were comparatively normal, they had refrained from even discussing internal affairs with him, and as soon as things should return to their normal course they would naturally confine themselves to their proper sphere. In reply, the governor-general made a little speech, expressing his gratitude to the two representatives for their consistent support. ^ He then showed them the reply received from the Ministers of War and the Interior to his telegram of the 28th. It was, as he said, profoundly unsatisfactory, and contained nothing but vague promises. That telegram, he said, showed that he could expect no help from head-quarters. Eocally, he was working day and night, was making nothing for himself, and was risking his reputation in a hopeless task. He was, consequently, determined to resign, and he asked the consuls whether they would not do the same in his place. He declared that Soulet-ed-Dowleh s attitude was nothing new, and was part of the general conspiracy against Sardar Assad, in which Zeigham-es-Sultaneh, Bakhtiari, and several others of the Sardar s enemies had taken part. He was sure Soulet would never co-operate loyally as long as Sardar Assad remained in power, and, consequently, the Central Government must either give him force enough to coerce Soulet, or accept his resignation. After consultation with M. Kadloubovsky, jVIr. Bill replied that he could not contest his Excellency^ argument, but it was possible that the position was still not thoroughly understood in Tehran, and he hoped that his Excellency would postpone his decision to resign until one more effort had been made. He asked for the minimum conditions on which his Excellency would consent to remain in office. The substance of the reply is contained in our joint telegram of the 2 nd. It is clear that this is an exceptional crisis in the affairs of Southern Persia. Saham-ed-Dowleh is a most exceptional man, and has done wonders with no force at all. Naturally, the experiment is now failing, and no one could hope to do as much in his place, especially as no one could hope to receive satisfactory support from the Central Government. The local members of the Persian Parliament left with considerable ceremony for Tehran on the 29th. One man was led through the bazars with a string through his nose on the same date. On the same date a telegram from the mullahs of Nejef to the Parliament was publicly read, by which Mullah Gurhan Ali of Zinjan is formally outlawed, and his blood made lawful to all Mussulmans. Another telegram was read at the same time from the Minister of the Interior announcing an approaching census. J. H.

We would further direct the attention of His Majesty’s Government to the tact that, in recent years, caravan robberies on a very large scale have taken place, and certain tribes have made a regular and profitable business of stopping and robbing caravans, and they have now Manchester bales stored in their forts sufficient for their | use for several years to come. # . j tj* Claims for the losses so incurred have from time to time been put forward by xiis Majesty’s Legation in Tehran, but probably for want of funds have so far not been met by the Persian Government. Now that a new loan is being negotiated it is hoped that immediate payment of these claims will be insisted upon, and we would also suggest that the Persian Government should be encouraged and urged to dispatch one or more punitive expeditions against the offending tribes with the view of exacting restitution of the stolen property, and damages and indemnities, and of destroying the strong holds. The moral effect of such action would be of immense value. It would make the question of restitution by other offending tribes a comparatively easy matter, won greatly facilitate the work of the road-guards, and probably make an end, o^e tor all, of a system that has most seriously hampered trade and greatly injure racers interests for a long time past. . ,1 It will be apparent that if the robber tribes find that, as opportum } occurs, ey can plunder caravans and retire to their strongholds to enjoy undistur e re 11 [ 1 s 0 their robberies, the new road-guards to be instituted will be continual y open 0 a ac ^s on the part of these brigands ; but if it is known that punishment \n over a e eui (even though delayed), then we feel sure that the work of the road-guards will be made much lighter. , .1 ,. . • We earnestly hope that this matter will be very strongly urged upon the attention of the Persian Government, and that all the necessary assistance wi e accor e We have, &amp;c.

T'/' ' ' ~ Sir A. Nicolson to Sir Edward Grey .— (Received January 17.) (No. 24.) Sir, St. Petersburg/!, January 12, 1910. M. IS VOLSKY handed to me to-day a memorandum, of which I have the honour to enclose a translation, in regard to the establishment of road guards to maintain order in the south of Persia. The consent of the Eussian Government to establishing such guards, according to my reading of the memorandum, gives us a free hand as to the time at which w T e should communicate the proposal to the Persian Government, and as to the mode in which we should present it. There is nothing in the memorandum, as I take it, which would indicate that the Eussian Government would raise any objection to Sir G. Barclay proceeding in the manner mentioned in his telegram No. 772 of the 6th November, should His Majesty’s Government so' desire. The only conditions in respect to road guards relate to the disposal of the surtax of 10 per cent. As the Russian Government do not intend to raise for the present the question of road guards in the north of Persia, the matter is considerably simplified. I may mention that 1 informed M. Isvolsky, in a private letter of the 29th December, in pursuance of the instructions in your telegram No. 1371 of the 28th December, that it would be desirable not to connect the question of British instructors organising the road guards with that of a money advance to the Persian Government, and that it wmuld be preferable to leave the choice of such instructors to the Persian Government, subject to our approval. As the memorandum does not refer to the instructors at all, it may be assumed that we can deal with that point in the manner which may appear most desirable. At the same time, having regard to the observations in the memorandum in respect to the objection to instructors, other than British or Eussian, being employed in the future “ gen darmerie,” or Persian army, it would seem to be advisable not to give the Persian Government any latitude in the selection of instructors for the road guards. As I hope that the Eussian Government may consent to the money advance being made to the Persian Government independently of any conditions at all, beyond some system of control over the expenditure, I would submit that the road guards should be treated as a question entirely apart from any advance or loan, and simply as a measure of a more or less temporary character for the immediate restoration of security on certain trade routes. In respect to the wider question of a “ gendarmerie ” and the organisation of the Persian army, the Eussian Government in their memorandum are explicit, and evidently intend to insist with all strenuousness on the employment of British and Eussian officers as instructors, and to make this point an essential condition to a loan. The reinforce ment of the Cossack brigade as a preliminary measure seems, as far as can be judged,; not necessarily to entail an increase in the number of Eussian officers, but to be adopted by means of and with the assistance of the native element among the officers. This is a point on which further explanation might be requested. I have, &amp;c. A. NICOLSON. Enclosure in No. 1. Memorandum communicated to Sir A. Nicolson by M. Isvolsky. (Confidential.) (Translation.) # THE Imperial Government fully share the opinion of the British Government respecting the expediency of forming road guards in Southern Persia for the purpose of securing the free and safe movement of trade caravans along the various routes. ^ It agrees also to a temporary increase of 10 per cent, of the import dues m the Persian Gulf for a period not exceeding three years, on the condition that this supplementary revenue shall be devoted to the maintenance of the above-mentioned guards. [2582 r—10]2 -mmmmmmez. ilHMimil—lirrni i - In view of the fact that the proposed measure mostly concerns the routes passing through the neutral zone, it appears desirable that the expenditure of the monies assigned for its realisation should be under the practical control of the local Russian and- British consular representatives. Within the limits of the British sphere of mfluem such control of course would be reserved exclusively to the Bntisn consuls. The aforesaid increase of customs dues could be arranged by means of an exchange of notes with the Persian Government, in which stipulation would be made for the payment of the above mentioned increase in full into the Russian or English banks, and also for placing its expenditure under the control specified. On its part, the Imperial Government at present has not any intention of raising the question of establishing similar guards on the northern roads. The Imperial Government does not connect the question of road guards with the questions of establishing a corps of gendarmerie and the reorganisation of the Persian army in general. The latter questions are very complicated, and w ill probably require some considerable time for their realisation. From information to hand, the Persian Government proposes to form a gendarmerie numbering approximately 6,000 men, and an army numbering from 25,000 to 30,000 men, and proposes to carry out recruiting for this purpose only in the spring Meanwhile, it is impossible not to fear serious disorders precisely when spring commences in Persia. As is known, during winter all life in that country is at a standstill, especially in those localities inhabited by the nomad tribes, but as soon as the weather becomes a little warmer increased restlessness is usually noticeable among the more turbulent elements. For this reason the Persian Govern ment in the spring should be already prepared for all eventualities. The Imperial Government is deeply convinced that there is only one way by which to realise this aim, namely, the immediate strengthening of the sole properly organised mditary force in Persia—the Shah’s Cossack brigade. This force presents in itself a ready-made cadre of native officers, non-commissioned officers, and men, with the assistance of which the brigade could easily be expanded into a division or more. The necessary weapons and military supplies could be given on credit by the Russian Government, in accordance with a request of the Shah’s Government received already some time ago. The Imperial Government propose in this respect that both the Powers interested in averting any grave complications in Persia should exercise serious pressure on the Persian Government in the sense indicated. As regards the question of foreign instructors for the future Persian gendarmerie and army, the Imperial Government, fearing intrigue and foreign influences, consider it to be unquestionably desirable that the instruction of the Persian forces should be entrusted only to Russian and English officers, not only in their respective spheres of influence, but also in the neutral zone, and it proposes that in this matter both Powers should use all thwr influence and exhaust all means at their disposal before entering on any concessions. The most powerful lever in this connection is the question of money assistance on the part of both Powers, which is indispensable to the Persian Government. This advantageous position for Russia and England must certainly be made use of in a proper manner, since a similar favourable occasion perhaps will not quickly present itself. In the last resort, it would be possible to agree only to the admission into the Persian army of subaltern officers of other nationalities, subject in every instance to the previous assent of Russia and England, and on the condition that the chief guidance of the Persian military forces should remain in the hands of Russian and English instructors. In the opinion of the Imperial Government this principle should be upheld also in the question of road guards, which should preferably be under English instructors in the south, as was originally the wish of the British Government. The Imperial Government is desirous of ascertaining the opinion of the London Cabinet on the proposals embodied above.

In fact I think they would he prepared to make an advance of 100,000/. without any conditions at all except some control over the expenditure. I might, with your permission, ask them this.

Minister for Foreign Affairs handed me a memorandum to-day on the subject. Russian Government agree as to the necessity of instituting road guards, and they also agree as to an increase of 10 per cent, on customs revenues for a period not exceeding three years, on condition that the proceeds of the surtax be devoted to payment of guards. In view of fact that projected measure principally applies to roads in central zone, it would appear desirable that expenditure of sums be under practical control of the Russian and British consular representatives in that zone. As regards British sphere, such control would be exclusively in hands of British consuls. Increase of customs revenues could be effected by an exchange of notes with the Persian Govern ment, in which it should be laid down that surtax should be paid into Russian British banks. Russian Government do not require road guards on their roads in the north. Minister for Foreign Affairs explained verbally that they already existed, and, moreover, roads were guarded by Russian troops. _ . . . Russian Government consider that this question of road guards is quite distinct from general question of organising a gendarmerie and reorganising the Persian army. This question is a complicated one which will take a long time to workout. In the meantime, as disorders usually occur in the spring, it is necessary for the l eisian Government to make preparations for eventualities. Only measure would be immediate reinforcement of Cossack brigade, which, by help of its native officers and native non-commissioned officers, could be expanded into a division, or more. Russian Government would be ready to supply guns and military supplies on credit to Persian Government in accordance with a request made some time ago by the 1 ersian Government. Russian Government are of opinion that it would be advisable to exert serious pressure on the Persian Government m the above-mentioned sense as to foreign instructors for gendarmerie and army. Russian Government, in view of possible intrigues and foreign influence consider it to be unquestionably desirable that instruction should be entrusted solely to Russian and British ofticeis and they propose that both Governments should use all their influence an d exhaust all means at their disposal before making any concessions on that point. The lina ^l aid desired by Persian Government affords the most powerful !®Y er ^ ^ Persian and this should be utilised. In last resort it would be possible to permit Persian -Government to employ only subaltern officers of a foreign nationality other t an Russian or British, and only after preliminary agreement with Russia and Gieat Britain. Chief supervision must always remain m British and Russian hands. I will send a translation of memorandum by messenger to-morrow.

With reference to your letter (No.40876) of the 16th November, and to previous correspondence on the subject of the provision of Road Guards in Southern Persia, I am directed by the Board of Trade to state, for the information of Sir E. Grey, that they have caused enquiries to be made of the principal firms en gaged in the Persian trade with regard to the proposed surcharge on imported goods. As a result of these inquiries, the Board have ascertained that it is probable that consxderable ob jection would be taken, by some at least of the firms Interested, to the levy at all the ports of the proposed surcharge in order to provide funds for the protection of the route inland from one port alone. The Board gather The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office. copy. C. 9041. (47u86) Sir:--■Am'VSt f gather^ however, that there would not he the same objec tion to the imposition of such a surcharge if levied solely on goods entering at Bushire: the road inland from Bushire being the only one proposed to be patrolled, It would further seem that if the estimate of the cost of a modified scheme given by Acting Consul Bill in his despatch of 1st September last be accepted as approximately correct, a 10 per cent surcharge at Bushire would, so far as can be judged from statistics available, be sufficient to provide the funds necessary for the adoption of that scheme. In view of these considerations, the Board are strongly of opinion that it would be desirable that the proposal to be made to the Persian Government should have in view a surcharge of 10 per cent on the import duties, collected at Bushire only, the proceeds to be devoted, in the manner suggested, for the security of the routes inland from that port. If the scheme be approved by that Government, it will of course be necessary to arrange for the proceeds of the surcharge to be paid over direct to the representatives of the Indo( 1 Indo-European Telegraph Department by the Customs Authorities at Bushire, to stipulate that the surcharge shall not continue in force beyond a definitely limited period (say three years) without the consent of His Majesty’s Government and to provide for the issue of all necessary directions to the Hoad Guard officers that their primary duty is to ensure the security of the roads as trade routes and only incidentally the security of the telegraph plant.

[43584] [November 29.] Section 1, Sir A. Nicolson to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received November 29.) (No. 625.) g- r St. Petersburgh, November 26, 1909. I HAVE the honour to report that the attack by Persian brigands on M. Passek, Russian consul-general at Bushire, on his journey from Shiraz forms the subject of a leading article in the &lt;£ Novoe Vremya ” of to-day. The jouroal observes that this incident confirms, in an unpleasantly realistic manner, the comments made in its columns a day or two ago as to the extremely curious statement made in the Shah’s Speech from the Throne to the effect that the Persian population were filled with grief and alarm at the presence of foreign troops on Persian territory. As a matter of fact order is guaranteed and safety of life ensured only in those places where there are a sufficient number of Russian soldiers. The troops of the Governor-General of Azerbaijan who were dispatched against Rahim Khan are returning to Tabreez after having remained a whole month at Serab doing nothing. The notorious Sattar Khan has fled from Ardebil, leaving the inhabitants to their fate. Persian and Russian merchants put all their hopes in the Russian troops at Ardebil and Tabreez for keeping the trade routes open. Such, then, is the sorrow of the Persian people over the “ foreign invasion.” Six trading caravans, belonging to those very Persians who (in the words of the Speech from the Throne) are so grievously dismayed by the presence of Russian troops in Persian territory, had attached themselves to the weakly guarded Russian transport column. After giving the details of the attack as reported by the telegraphic agency, the “ Novoe Vremya” continues : “ Such is the order existing m p ers i a —i n one of the quietest districts of Persia. Bands of robbers numbering hundreds of persons muster there and give regular battle to travellers without let or hindiance. Where, then, are the Persian authorities ? The ‘ serious representations made by the Russian Minister at Tehran will evoke an equally serious reply from the Persian, Government, which has just shown in the Speech from the Throne how thoroughly it understands the gravity of tbie situation. But the most serious of diplomatic documents will not frighten brigands ; swords and bullets must be employed in dealing with them, not pourparlers. And this is the very respect m which the Persian Government is incompetent. The force they sent to Ardebil achieved nothing in the course of a mont except to frighten the peaceful inhabitants. Sattar Khan, the most famous o eisian military leaders, has proved his ability by a hurried flight from the place of danger. What, then, is the use of the 4 most serious’ representations made by M. Poklewski. Are they not rather likely to prove a laughing-stock ? The Persian Government knows how to compose a Speech from the Throne, but is absolutely mcapab e o pieseivmg general order or even of safeguarding foreign diplomatic representatives in these circumstances, if the Russian Minister feels that he is indeed the represen a rve o a Great Power and not merelv a diplomatic clerk, he should take other s eps on us own responsibility.

[42615] No. 1. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received November 22.) (No. 201.) Tehran, October BO, 1909. SINCE my last review of the situation disturbances have broken out in eastern Azerbaijan, where Rahim Khan and the Shahsevans are seriously threatening Ardebil. Rahim Khan is stated to have given out that he is acting in the interest of Mohammed Ali, but his previous record tends rather to the supposition that it is a looting rather than a political movement. However this may be, the Persian Government are con centrating all their efforts to deal with this brigand chief. Mukhber-es-Sultaneh has sent from Tabreez reinforcements to the number of 1,500 for Sattar Khan, who has with him a force of 1,000, and a further force of 1,500 is being dispatched from Tehran. These latter troops should be a good fighting force, as they comprise, amongst others, a number of Persian Cossacks and of Bakhtiari, as well as some 300 Mujaheddin (nationalist volunteers who fought under Sipahdar at the time of the revolution) commanded by Yprim, who was the leading spirit in Sipahdar s force, and has since been doing excellent work as chief of police in the capital. What is perhaps more to be desired, however, than the dispatch of troops is a clear understanding on the part of the Shahsevans and Rahim Khan’s men that Rahim Khan does not enjoy Russian sympathy, and that, in the event of Russian intervention being necessary, he will be made to bear the consequences of his misdeeds. Some two months ago, as I have reported by telegraph, a small Russian force was sent to his district from Tabreez, accompanied by a consular officer, with the object of exacting compensation for injury to Russian interests. This object was achieved, but that the expedition should have been followed shortly after by Rahim Khan’s active rebellion has given rise to the suspicion that the purpose of the expedition was other than the recovery of plunder. Such a suspicion was perhaps inevitable among a people always ready to attribute their troubles to Russian intrigue, but the Russian acting consul-general would have^ done better to avoid intercourse of any kind with Rahim Khan. The mission to this brigand chief was imprudent, to say the least of it, as was also the dispatch of the doctor of the Russian consulate-general a little later in order to treat him for an attack of paralysis, for however absurd the suspicion that Russia is inciting Rahim Khan to disorder may be, his intercourse with the Russian consulate-general may easily be made by him to appear as an indication of Russian sympathy. The Russian doctor w^as instructed to urge him to keep quiet, but, as a member of the Government said to my Russian colleague, Rahim Khan probably gave out amongst his followers that he broug t messages of good-will from the Russian consulate-general. Since then M. Miller has been instructed to convey to him a warning that he will be held personal y responsi e for any injury to Russian interests wrought by his tribesmen or the Shahsevans. ^ is to be hoped that this message will facilitate the task of Reshid-ul-Mulk, who, as reported in my telegram No. 761, has been sent by Mukhber-es-Sultane to nego la e with a view to a peaceful settlement. ,, Except for Ardebil, my information shows that the state of public order m t e provinces is relatively satisfactory. Seyyid Hussein Lari has been summone o Tehran, and I have heard no more of Lingah’s being exposed to danger from this turbulent seyyid. The Yezdikasht district, on the border of the provinces of bars and Ispahan, is suffering from the depredations of the Kuhgeluis, and a ns pom in c is held up on the Shiraz-Ispahan road, but, apart from this, the sta e o ie sou lern roads shows some improvement. The roads from Tezd to Ispahan an ^ eiman are now open to traffic, and it is reported that caravans have recommenced running on e 10 a from Bushire to Shiraz, though I learn this morning that the Kas igais are oc mg e road between Kazerun and Shiraz. - ^ 1 m ^ moc In Tehran there is no sign of any trouble, and the Resht roa seems o safe than it always has been. Early in the period under review there was [2491 ?/—2] *2 discontent amongst a number of the Mujaheddin. The meetings of some sixty or seventy of these to protest against the alleged misappropriation of funds by Sipahdar gave occasion for alarmist rumours, but the movement was entirely pacific, and there ^ was never any ground for apprehending trouble. Sipahdar, the Prime Minister, visited' one of their meetings and apparently satisfied the malcontents, for there have been no more of these miniature demonstrations. The situation of the Government remains apparently what it was four weeks ago. On the surface the advanced Nationalists seem to be co-operating with the Government, and indeed one of them, Yussuk-ed-Dowleh, has joined the Cabinet as Minister of Justice in the place of Farman Farma, who is said to have resigned in the hope of getting a better post in the next Ministry. Nevertheless, the opinion is general that when the Medjliss meets a determined attempt will be made to upset the Ministry. More than sixty deputies are said to be now in Tehran. A quorum for the meeting of the Medjliss is sixty-one, but it will not open until there is sufficient margin ; taking into account the possibility of some of the elections being found to have been irregular, a fortnight may therefore elapse before the Assembly meets. I am happy to say that my Russian colleague has recommended the withdrawal of the bulk of the Russian troops from Fazvin. It is to be hoped that the Russian Government will be guided by his advice. I feel that it may well be a case of now or never,” for if the Medjliss meets before the force at Kazvin has been reduced, I regard as inevitable an anti-Russian agitation which would make it very difficult for Russia to withdraw her troops. The good impression which the reduction of her force at Tabreez was expected to produce has been, if noticeable at all, merely momentary, and there is already a good deal of clamour in the press. The agitation, however, has not yet assumed such proportions as to make a withdrawal of the troops from Kazvin difficult for Russia’s amour-propre, and there is still time for her to take this step with a good grace. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. P.S. October 31.—Since writing the above I have learned from my Russian colleague that his Government have decided to withdraw the bulk of the Kazvin force. Sixty men are to be left at Kazvin, and between 400 and 500 are to remain for the moment at Resht and Enzeli. At the same time that M. Poklewsky gave me this information I received Sir A.

IN accordance with the instructions conveyed to me in your telegram No. lk 1328 of the 13th instant, I explained to M. Isvolsky the substance of Sir G. Barclay’s proposals relative to the measures which might be taken for establishing order and security on the Bushire—Ispahan road, and I left with his Excellency an aide-me'move on the subject, of which I have the honour to enclose a copy. This afternoon M. Isvolsky said that the Russian Government would raise no objections to the scheme, but that he thought that the two Governments should take combined action both in regard to the norihern and the southern roads. I am afraid that this suggestion, if acted upon, may not be very welcome to the Persian Government, and may perhaps render them less disposed to view the British project with favour. I did not inform his Excellency of the procedure which Sir G. Barclay proposes to adopt in laying the matter before the Persian Government, as it seemed to me unnecessary to do so at this stage of the question, and 1 thought that it would be well to await the decision of His Majesty’s Government on the project, and also to defer any observations which you may wish me to offer until I receive the reply of M. Isvolsky in writing. I merely said to him this afternoon that His Majesty’s Government were examining the project of Sir G. Barclay. I have, &amp;c. A. NICOLSON. Inclosure in No. 1. / Aide-memoire communicated to M. Isvolsky by Sir A. Nicolson. •Nl) main for it ave me I r of wlicll THE question of maintaining security on the Bushire-Ispahan roads has become an urgent one, and the British Government have now under their consideration certain proposals which have been submitted to them by the British Minister at Tehran. Sir G. Barclay is of opinion that the most effective means of ensuring the suppression of the continued depredations and brigandage which have rendered the above-mentioned trade route so unsafe would be the establishment of an efficienc corps of road guards. He proposes that a force of 600 road guards should be raised locally, who would patrol the road by sections. These road guards would be organised and superintended by six officers, who would be lent by the Indo-European Telegraph Department. The force would be placed under the Ministry of the Interior, and not under the Ministry of Whr. It is estimated that the total cost ought not to exceed 15,000/. a-year, and this expenditure might be met for a given period—say, for three years—by a surcharge of 10 per cent, on the import and export duties at the Persian ports of the Gulf. The traders interested in the matter would hardly object to this surcharge, as the present illegal levies and enhanced transport rates would cease as soon as the road guards were in a position to perform their duties effectively. ^ His Majesty’s Embassy desires to inform the Imperial Ministry for Foreign Affairs of the above project, which the British Government are at present examining. His Majesty’s Embassy has learnt that the Persian Government-, have applied to the Imperial Russian Government for the sale of a number of rifles and ammunition, and it is earnestly hoped that any conditions which the Imperial Russian Government may deem it desirable to impose on the sale of arms will not hamper any action which the British Government might desire to take in the way of creating road guards, who in reality will be merely a local police force. His Majesty’s Embassy desires to expiess the confident hope that the Imperial Russian Government will view favourably the measures to which the British Government may wish to secure the consent of the Persian Government, in order that order and security may be re-established on an important trade route, as it is a matter of very urgent necessity that the present unsatisfactory condition of the southern roads should be remedied as soon as possible.

Whether the European merchants who do business m the Gulf are likely to object to such a surcharge the President of the Board of Trade wdl he better able to inform Sir E. Grey than is Lord Morley. But his Lordship assumes that Sir George Barclay has satisfied^ himself that a more modest scheme (perhaps on the scale suggested by Mr. Bill in his letter of the 1st September last), the cost of which could be met by a charge on the trade of Bushire alone, would not be likely to be effective. , , j -n ^ -p™. Subject to this remark, Lord Morley approves the scheme, and will arrange loi the loan of six officers from the Indo-European Telegraph Department, if required.

Tehran, November 11, 1909, 2*45 p.m. MY Russian colleague tells me that the Persian Government has asked the Russian Government to sell them 10,000 rifles and 2,500,000 cartridges, to be paid for later. There is talk of the establishment of a large force of gendarmerie, and the Russian Minister, who suspects that the Persian Government are contemplating inviting German instructors, is suggesting to his Government that if the rifles [? ordered] are supplied it should be on the condition that the Persian Government should undertake to employ none but Russian instructors for any armed force. I had already told him about my proposal for Bushire-Ispahan route, to which he made no demur at the time, and he seems still to think that, being a local police force, it is not incompatible with the general undertaking he desires to obtain. I presume that the Russian Government will ask you for^tiy support to obtain the undertaking. If so, and if the proposal in my telegram No. 772 is approved, it would he well to make the necessary reserve [? referred to] regarding the proposed police force on Bushire-Ispahan road. (St. Petersburgh informed.)The only question raised in Sir G.Barclay’s telegram, which appears to affect the Telegraph Department, is whether the Department can lend the services of six suitable officers to raise locally, organise, and superin tend a force of 600 road guards to patrol the roads. These officers, it is proposed to second for a period apparently of three years, I have little doubt that six suitable officers can be found, who would volunteer for the proposed duty. As I have pointed out before the lately established direct and very efficient system of telegraph working betv/een London and Karachi has relieved the Departmental telegraph offices in Persia,, more especially Teheran, of much signalling work that had previously to be carried out. This allows of some reduction of staff in these offices, and the men that could, oe spared it was my intention to send to the Meshed-Seistan line to replace the Indian Telegraph Department’s telegraphists now employed there. If however six men are removed from the Department for the road control work there may oe some delay in finding other men for the Meshed-Seistan line. The Indo-European Telegraph Company has asked me if I cared to take over any of their men at Teheran, whose services can be spared by the Company, owing to the diiect London Karachi transmission of telegrams. There v;ill therefore be no difficulty in providing sufficient sig nalling staff should six men be removed under the present proposals,and any delay ^n replacing the Indian Telegraphists A by this Department’s men appears to be of secondary importance. 8 t]i November 1909.In any further communica tion on this subject, please quote No.40876 and address— ^ The Under-Secretary of State, | i Foreign Office, London.

I have the honour to place before you a Memorandum on the prevailing condition of the trade routes within the sphere of my post—more especially of the Bushire-Shiraz route—drawn up for me by His Majesty’s Vice-Consul. I am well aware that His Majesty’s Government are generally cognizant of the deplorable condition of insecurity into which all the main arteries of traffic in Southern Persia have been thrown by the chronic state of chaos and anarchy under which the country has been labouring for the past three years. The subject was one of those specially commended to attention in my letter No. 1726-1727 to the address of the Government of India and His Majesty’s Minister, dated 6th June 1908 ; since then we have taken the opportunity afford ed by the visit of Mr. Charles Akers to the Persian Gulf to report upon commercial matters to the Foreign Office and the Board of Trade, to urge him to represent at Tehran, and if possible in London, how fundamentally the prospects of our commerce in this region are bound up with and depend upon the question of security on the main caravan routes leading from the coast of the Persian Gulf to the chief trading centres of the interior. The situation in the Capital has now reached a well-marked stage at which it seems possible that an opening may at any time offer itself for some definite action or form of co-operation on our part with the Central Government, in what ever form it may now be, for the restoration of order or the financing of reforms. I trust, therefore, that the present moment may not prove inopportune for the submission of the accompanying note on the commercial outlook. It may. I think be taken for granted from the variety of suggestions and schemes which have been put forward by different officers of Government for policing the trade routes, that there are several methods by which a reasonable measure of security could be provided ; but it is difficult to offer useful comment in regard to the details or relative advantages of individual schemes until His Majesty’s Government feel in a position to give their representatives some idea of the extent and general lines of co-operation of disguised intervention which their present policy renders feasible. Pending that time I can do little more than urge upon them the pressing necessity which appears to me from the local point of view to exist for the inauguration of some reasonably effective measure for rescuing the several impor tant British firms engaged in the trade to Southern Persia via the Gulf Ports from the veritable slough of despond into which they are slowly sinking. Failing some early step on the part of Government in this direction one cannot but feel convinced that they will be forced to resign themselves to retire ment from the field, an ominous contingency which I should witness with great regret and dismay. A copy of this despatch is being submitted to His Majesty’s Minister. G. C. B. P., Sim'a.-No C037F.D.—11-8 09—44—G. E. D.Disorders on the Trade Routes of Southern' Persia, The state of trade in Southern Persia is, at the present time, most seriously affecting British interests. This is especially true of Pars. The result of two years’ fighting amongst the Kashgai, Lur and Arab tribes in the neighbourhood of Shiraz and along the caravan routes leading to that trade centre was, in the first place, to render the despatch of goods into the districts normally fed by Shiraz quite unsafe, and in consequence to cause an overflooding and congestion of goods in Shiraz itself. This market like that of Bushire has subsisted for years almost entirely on British credit; during the current period of unrest Bills have had to be met, and to find money goods have had to be disposed of, usually at a heavy loss. On the other hand the British firms have found outstandings ever harder and harder to get in, and at the best their accounts are often only partially settled. In addition to the insecurity prevailing round Shiraz and along the Ispahan road and the outlying buying centres, bad harvests and the political troubles have further undermined the position of all trade in Southern Persia. Two and a half years of this state of affairs have damaged the stability of most Persian traders ; there has been no chance of making losses good : many bankruptcies have occurred in Bushire and enquiries at which I have been present have brought home to me the heavy losses incurred by some British firms and the jeopardy into which the capital, which all Arms have outstanding, is already thrown. A British Indian Firm of Bombay established for more than fifty years in Basrah and Bushire is closing up its Bushire branch. Messrs. David Sassoon and Company, Limited, had, so I understood, some time ago more than ^50,000 outstanding from their Bushire office, though this has since been considerably' reduced ; and we were informed at one time that this very old house in Persia were threatening to withdraw altogether unless something was done to help British trade over the Shiraz route. Messrs. Dixon and Company have large sums outstanding due to their Bushire office alone, and their affairs in Ispahan are said to be in an unsatis factory position. Messrs. Livingstone, Zeytoon and Company, Limited, anew firm, have found their venture so far quite unprofitable. Messrs. Gray Paul and Company have practically ceased dealing in merchandise and confine themselves to the work of a Shipping Agency. Piece-goods have not been coming forward in any quantity for the past three months. The year March 1908-1909 has seen the import of Manchester goods alone into Bushire reduced from ^439,9^7 to ^318,375 : the year 1909-1910 promises to be infinitely worse, the first quarter’s figures being only ^41,585. It cannot be denied that the commercial supremacy of Great Britain in Southern Persia and the districts bordering the Gulf has gained greatly in importance owing to recent developments of the political situation. It therefore seems all the more necessary for us to come to the assistance of existing British commercial institutions and enable them to tide over the present critical period of anarchy in Southern Persia. This cannot be done unless some definite commercial policy is adopted by the British authorities and early action taken to give effect to it. The question on which everything primarily hinges is the safety of the caravan routes. Ihe importance of this has been repeatedly pressed by one officer after another even when the province of pars was in relatively good order, and the matter is far more urgent now.The proclamation, or even the inception of a constitution does notin itself offer any probability of the slightest improvement in the safety of the Bushire- Shiraz and the Bunder Abbas-Kerman routes. It must take years to bring Pars back to a condition of reasonable security and prosperity. It is evident that the continuance of disturbance along those arteries of trade, while diminishing trade in goods of Danger of encroachment by Russian trade. British origin, tends to open markets like Yezd, Shiraz, Kerman, Ispahan to the descent of Russian trade from the north’: and His Majesty’s Consul at Kerman has recently complained that Russian cotton-goods have been displacing British because of the insecurity on the Bunder Abbas route. The local chieftains along the 180 miles of the Bushire-Shiraz road have become independent of the Governor- Extortion by Khans along roads. General of Pars and are in a constant state of warfare with each other. The posts are tampered with and robbed every few weeks. Despite the specific engagement entered into by the Persian Government in the Commercial Convention of U03, Article 4, “ Rahdari ” is extorted by armed tribesmen along the route in ever increasing amounts. A statement of these exactions is appended. A sum of one kran is even^ extracted by the Kalantar at the gate of Bushire, and when protest was made in 1907 the Local Governor simply replied that he was powerless as the Minister of Finance still included this item in the schedule of revenue which the Governors of Bushire have to make good : if the Persian Government would erase the item from the schedule, he, the Governor, would cause the levy to be discontinued. Caravans are liable to be molested at all points and on every route leading from Bushire. The deviation by Shitf, situated 9 miles from Bushire by sea, has been alluded to in all recent trade reports. It is shunned by all British and the principal Persian merchants on account of its many inconveniences and reputation for pilferages. The Khan of Angali, desirous of the caravan route passing through his territory, the exclusive right of which he has for three years past tried to obtain by large bribes offered to the local Governor, loses no opportunity which fortune or a weak Governor may place in his way of coercing muleteers by imposts or by detention of mules into using the Shief-Daliki road. Only lately he exact ed a fine of 50 tomans (approximately ^10) besides “rahdari” dues from an unprotected caravan of 70 mules, which was approaching Bushire by the main route which borders on his land. The “ Imperial ” road, passing through Borazjun, Daliki and up the t mountains to Kazerun, now in use for many years past, has been blocked for the last two months by the great feud which has joined the Khan of Kamarij and the headman of Daliki and the Khan of Borazjun. Report says that disputes about the passage of caravans have been the origin of the feud. Fighting has been heavy, and the narrow passes in the hands of the combatants. The dangers of the present situation are shown by the recent firing on the Russian Acting Consul-General, although he w r as travelling with an escort of Cossacks. The telegraph office at Konartakhteh has been a centre for operations. In 1908 the unrest was focussed a little further on between Kumarij and Kazerun: 1907 was marked by troubles in the Kashgai tribe between Kazerun and Shiraz and by a series of postal robberies. The main route being so hampered for traffic native merchants in Shiraz have been of late endeavouring to arrange with the Kashgai Ilkhani for the transport of caravans by the Firuzabad route, which in its course to Bushire traverses Dashti territory, a district inhabited by a very lawless population and Tangistan. The absence of the telegraph on this route and the likelihood of robbery occurring without the slightest chance of compensation being obtained, and other difficulties in the shape of dearth of forage, provisions, and caravan accommodation make British merchants very chary of trusting their goods to it.3 Another serious feature ha^ been the dearth of mule transport which has arisen. Muleteers have been so ill-treated and so Dearth of transport. plagued by robbers and “ roadguards ” during the past two years that a very large number have forsaken the route altogether and gone to the Yezd road or even more north still to the Resht road. The result is that even when a short spell of comparative tranquillity does occur merchants cannot depend on being able to get transport. Whereas in 1905 from 5,000 to 7,000 mules are stated to have been con stantly engaged between Bushire and Shiraz, now in 1909 a British forwarding agency and Persian mule-brokers estimate them at between 2,000 and 3,000. Some 1,500 Shiraz mules are stated to have forsaken the Bushire road for the Resht and Kermanshah routes (which are not in the British sphere of influence). No large caravan had come down from Shiraz to Bushire from March to June 1909, and then only via Firuzabad. The price of transport has risen to such an extent that it has become a burden on trade. The following figures Price of transport. show clearly the rise from the normal since the period of anarchy commenced :— 1900 per 737 lbs., 185 miles, Krans 90 - 80 - 60 . 1901 1902 1 9°4 i9°5 March 1906-07 ,, 1907-08 „ 1908-09 „ 1909-10 (or a rise from app. £ 1-9 to £ 5 - 3 .) A further proof of the straits to which commerce has been reduced along the Shiraz road is shown in the premium insurance. rates of insurance companies in England. Formerly 15 shillings per £\oo was accepted by most underwriters for cotton bales from Manchester to Shiraz and Ispahan and included risk of robbery. In 1907 the rate was 30 shillings, I think, while in 1908 the long list of robberies had sent the rate up to 40 shillings, and very few companies could be found to accent the risk. Bv April iqoq practically all insurance to Shiraz was refused in England, war risks being asked, which means £5 to £10 per £100. The result is that the risk of robbery between Bushire and Shiraz falls on the British exporter, not on the insurance company as hitherto, nor on the Persian buyer. Recovery of claims was, up till I9°6&gt; frequently effected from the Fars Government but during the last 18 months Recovery of claims. claims for British merchandise stolen on the Bushire-Shiraz road with a value of 3,810 tomans (app. ^620) have been left unsettled and unattended to by the Persian authorities. These claims were advanced by British agencies alone. Lawlessness is so far advanced on the Bushire-Shiraz route that it is doubt ful if any Governor-General of bars will Prospects of order being restored. necessar y influence and troops tO restore order. Persians concerned in the forwarding business to the interior appear to look to the British authorities alone for the necessary power to replace the road on a secure footing and repress illegal exactions. A Seyyid, one of the two principal Persian merchants in Bushire, told me a few days ago that in his belief matters would become even worse than what they I ;' I , u )) )t 1) 95-80-IOO-UO ’i 1* » »&gt; )&gt; 80 V &gt;» J&gt; i) 80-90. &gt;s » n 85 - 95 - 75 * 95-110 !&gt; » &gt;i I50-220-140-150 !&gt; » &gt;1 » &gt;&gt; l6o-I20-110-90-140 »* »• &gt;&gt; M 140-160-170-220 »&gt; )&gt; &gt;} J&gt; »&gt; 200-250-3OO •4 Bm 1 ’ fX/HI i Hi . : were, and that possibility besides entailing grave political results would certainly mean the ruination of Persian traders on a large scale with the resultant effects on the British capital employed. Further, the prevailing disorders on the two southern roads have had the effect of depreciating the receipts of the Southern Customs to an amount which quite fails to suffice for the interest due towards the British loan and the interest pledged on the customs to the Imperial Bank of Persia. It is proposed to draw attention elsewhere to the disastrous effect which wholesale smuggling is having on the stability of many traders, but it is indirectly connected with theroau question. The first stage towards restoring security for trade in the South is the proper Policing of the road. P? lic j n g of ^ ™ atls n and . ever y, European who knows Southern Persia at the present time despairs of this, unless it is done under foreign supervision. Several suggestions have been put forward, such as the formation of a trans port company, which would furnish its own guards ; the enlistment of a corps of Persian guards controlled by officers with a leaven of non-commissioned officers and men of the Indian army ; or the temporary employment of an Indian Pioneer regiment on the road, who would busy themselves with removing the physical difficulties of the road, and fixing upon a possible alignment for a future route for railed traffic, while guarding the transport of caravans. Finally, in emphasising the especial interest which British commerce and interest and importancb attached to Bushire British policy have in the Bushire-Shiraz road ’ route, one point deserves mention. There appears to be some apprehension that it is desired to promote the diver sion of traffic from the Gulf to Ispahan to the Ahwaz-Ispahan route (Lynch’s con cession) in preference to the Bushire road, as more important to British interests. It is true that a certain amount of cargo destined for transport vtd Shiraz has, owing to the recent perilous condition of the latter road, had to be reshipped to Ahwaz, but on the whole the relative importance of the two routes for the trans port of British goods and the spread of British trade is not to be compared. The Ahwaz-Ispahan route is hampered by snow for a considerable period during the winter season ; it possesses no caravanserais, nor telegraph facilities ; and, more particularly, it passes through no large trading centres or trading popula tions on its course to Ispahan. The Bushire road, on the other hand, traverses Borazjun and Kazerun, an agricultural centre, on its way to Shiraz and north of Shiraz it proceeds vid Abadeh and Kumeshah to Ispahan. To some extent the Yezd market is also dependent on this route. For some generations past the trading instincts along this road have been encouraged, and there are now flourishing native commercial communities with great interdependence of intereets in Bushire, Shiraz and Ispahan, of which the forwarding system is not the least. • • u u he prosperity of all three towns is largely British credit with which business is carried on, and were the normal transport of merchandise to spahan by the Bushire road to be transferred permanently or for any length of time to the Ahwaz route, British trade and capital in Shiraz and Bushire must in my judgment inevitably suffer. H. G. CHICK.6 The abov epoints to an increase of Krans i r3Q per mule since 1907, and it may be noted that it shows “ rahdari ” and other illegal taxes exacted as far as Kazerun only, i.e., 100 miles of the journey.

Gulhek, 15th June 1909. No. 122. ' Sir, With reference to your despatch No. 219 of 24th December last enclosing copies of correspondence with Messrs. Dixon in regard to the insecurity of trade routes in Southern Persia, I have the honour to report that Messrs. Dixon at the same time instructed their representative at Isfahan to discuss with His Majesty’s Consul-General a proposal for policing the roads similar to that sub mitted to you, but with the difference that the firm suggested the enployment of telegraph gholams for the purpose instead of that of Indian soldiers. His Majesty’s Consul at Shiraz to whom Mr. Grahame forwarded copies of Messrs. Dixon’s letter to their agent and of his own covering despatch to me, has now approached me urging the pressing necessity for introducing some adequate measures of policing the roads. Mr. Bill, who is in agreement with Mr. Grahame as to the urgency of finding some means of allaying the growing sense of uneasiness among British and British Indian traders in regard to the trade routes of Southern Persia, puts forward a scheme, based on Messrs. Dixon’s suggestion, that gholams of the Indo-European Telegraph Depart ment should be employed as road guards. He suggests the gradual establish ment by the Department of a staff of well mounted and armed gholams, whose primary object would of course be the care of the telegraph line, but whose presence on the road would, in his opinion, go far to prevent the frequent robberies and to ensure the good conduct of the tribes. He further suggests that small parties of these gholams should accompany caravans travelling on the road at a charge to be paid by the merchants interested. The Director of the Telegraph Department, to whom I have submitted Mr. Bill’s despatch for his observations, points out however the many objec tions to which the scheme is open. He argues that apart from the initial cost of such an undertaking the maintenance of such a force would entail an annual extra expenditure of from £6,000 to 7 } 000 a year which it is unlikely would be covered by charges made on traders claiming protection^ for their caravans, though Mr. Bill is sanguine that the scheme, when once m working order, could become self-supporting. Mr. Barker adds that, as by its convention with the Persian Government, the Department is entitled to protection from the Persian Government, were the policing of the southern road entrusted to its staff, it would to some extent abrogate its right to be protected. As stated in another despatch I hope to discuss with Major Cox, in the course of his approaching visit to Tehran, the question of the insecurity of the southern roads, and I shall then have the honour to address you again on the subject.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 162 of the 22nd August, 1909, I have the honour to forward a provisional scheme, prepared by Mr. Acting Consul Bill and Mr. J. C. Smith, of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, for the policing of the Bushire-Ispahan road by means of telegraph gholams. I make no attempt to comment on the details of this scheme, as time is of importance, and I wish to send Mr. Bill’s despatch by to-day’s post in order that it may, if possible, reach you while Major Cox is still in England, so that you may have the opportunity of discussing it with him. Major Cox is better able than I to judge whether the proposed scheme would be likely to prove more effective than a grant of subsidies to the local chiefs. I notice Mr. Bill does not favour the latter, and, indeed, if the tribes are as free from the control of their chiefs as Mr. Bill describes them as being, a system of subsidies might prove ineffective; still it would have the advantage of being easier of acceptance for the Persian Government, and it would not have the disadvantage of arousing the antagonism of the local chiefs towards the Telegraph Department. I notice that Mr. Bill estimates the cost of the working of his scheme at something under 8,000/. a-year, a sum which I imagine would, if used in subsidies dependent on results, suffice as an effective inducement to the local chiefs to do their utmost to maintain order and to prevent illegal exactions. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. Inclosure 1 in No. 1. Actinq Consul Bill to Sir G. Barclay. (No. 36.) gi r Shiraz, September 1, 1 909. IN accordance with instructions contained in your telegram No. 76, dated the 25th August, 1909, I have the honour to forward a provisional scheme prepared by myself, in concert with Mr. J. G. Smith, assistant superintendent, Indo-Euiopean Telegraph Department, Shiraz, to whom in especial the estimates for buildings are entirely due, while his long experience and thorough knowledge of the local conditions have been of the greatest value in the preparation of the scheme generally. On the assumption that if the scheme as sketched meets with your approval it will reach the Foreign Office before the departure from London of His Majesty s resident in the Persian Gulf, I have not sent a copy to Bushire. I have, &amp;c. J. H. BILL, I.C.S. Inclosure 2 in No. 1. Provisional Scheme prepared by Acting Consul Bill, in co-operation with Mr. Smith. 1. Preliminary. BEFORE entering upon the numerical and financial details of the proposed 'orce it is desirable to set out clearly its task, its character, and its limitations. Its task is to keep the telegraph line from being constantly bulleted by casual narksmen, to keep the caravan road clear of casual marauders, o I’ 1 ^' e &gt;f illegal dues of every kind, to obtain information of intended raids, and in the lattei [2451 y—1]case to hold up caravans till, under the orders of the inspector, a sufficient furce has -been assembled to drive off the anticipated raiders. The obstacles in the way consist of (a) the local khans and (b) the nomads. Of these, the former are important factors at the southern end of the road, from Bushire to Kazeroon, the latter, slightly overlapping, from Konartakhteh to Ispaha^ The former would be strongly opposed to the new force, less on account of its inter ference with direct depredation than on account of its prohibition of the innumerable illegal exactions which they now levy upon the trade. The success of the scheme would, in fact, effect an enormous reduction in the income of each of the chiefs. The principal men concerned are the Khans of Chahkutah and Angali in the maritime plain, the Zabit of Borasjoon, Nur Muhammad Beg of Daliki, and Haider Khan of Kamarij. They are, however, far too deeply divided by intestine quarrels to unite even against a common menace of this character. The nomad chiefs, on the other hand, would be less fundamentally affected, as the new force would merely prevent their followers from using the telegraph insulators as targets, and would stop the direct robberies, which do not form an essential source of any chiefs income, though no doubt the percentage of stolen property which falls to the chiefs lot is an attractive windfall. They would, however, have a natural objection to anything smacking of law and order. By far the most effective method of dealing with these gentry would of course be the employment of military force adequate not only to provide the every-day police of the road, but also to punish by its own strength any village or tribe infringing the &lt;c Pax Perso-Britannica ” which it is intended to establish. Such a force does not exist in Pars, and there are no signs that it is to be found anywhere in Persia. If it is to be employed it must come from outside, i.e., from India. It cannot be too emphatically stated that, for the immediate object in view, the direct employment of British troops is in every way preferable. It would cut at the root of the evil of which the present scheme does not pretend to be more than a palliative. It is only if the employment of British troops is judged impracticable for political reasons that the scheme set out below is worthy of examination as a pis aller. It results from the above that the proposed force is not a military, nor even a military police, force. _ It will confine its operations strictly to the actual route which it has to guard, and its numbers are as insufficient as its organisation is unsuited for anything in the nature of a punitive expedition, even on the most modest scale. All that it could do would be to force marauders to work on such a scale as to make the responsibility of the chiefs concerned not only clear but conspicuous, and it would then be for the Persian Government to deal with them as best it could. It is obvious that the weak point of the scheme lies just here. At the present moment the Khamsah tribes, under the nominal control of Kawam-ul-Mulk, are absolutely out of hand, and obey no one at all but their own headmen, and’that imperfectly. The Kashgai for the moment yield a fairly general obedience to Soulet- ed-Dowleh, but he has many enemies, both within the tribe and at Tehran, and the appointment of his brother, Zeigham-ed-Dowleh, would suffice to break up the tribe into sections and reduce them to the same condition of lawlessness as the Khamsah. i 6 ^ ave obeyed and will obey no one at all, not even their own chiefs. Anc t re village chiefs of the south habitually treat the Pars Government with open contempt. r \ Under these circumstances, little support can be looked for from the Persian Government just where it is most needed, namely, to prevent concerted action against the new force, which, if undertaken by any considerable khan or tribe, would be quite irresistible by the force as provided in the scheme. There is only one remedy for this difficulty, and it is one which may perhaps be considered to go far to diminish the political advantage of the scheme over the direct em Ji, °y ine ] n ^ 0 0 ice. Tliat remedy is for the local British consular authorities to be aut orised to explain verbally to the chiefs concerned that the British Government means to see this road put in order, that the new scheme is an attempt to do this by ^ eisian a g enc y&gt; which it is to the interest of the local chiefs to favour, but that ! ^ 'g em ? 18 brought to nothing by the incorrigible misbehaviour of the inhabitants it will be replaced by a British force capable of enforcing the maintenance of order by punitive expeditions and arrest and punishment of the guilty parties. T ,. eie is a certain temptation to propose a system of allowances as practised on the n lan frontier, but I am strongly of opinion 'tFiat such a proposal is to be deprecated. I he Persian is not a Pathan ; he is easily frightened by a resolute attitude, and quick ' fue m® er ^imagine j|f capable ( jmsioii h ti tftk tbe 1 gwr; but fes on a r mdcircu se tbe neci it be unden taferof me i«l tribes.

Web, On tbe n bould, bon Vntontl Azdikbast Jj pW of the 19 4e entire %ty’s con kestrel3 to recover confidence on any symptoms of weakness; and it is, in my opinion, of great importance to establish at the start the fundamental principle that all forms of impost on internal trade are and must remain absolutely abolished. The only form of pecuniary advantage which might properly be offered to the local khans and nomad chiefs is a percentage—say 5 per cent.—on the pay of the gholams recruited by their means. By an adroit use of this bait the recruiting officers might contrive to attract to the support of the force a sufficient proportion of the chiefs to make a strong hostile coalition impossible. But the only solid foundation for the scheme, which will certainly be unpopular at the start, is fear; and as there is nothing in Persia for the tribes to be afraid of, it must be fear of the British Government. The numerical and financial proposals set out below must be considered in the light of the above statement. They represent the lowest estimate upon which it can reasonably be hoped that the task, as above limited, can be performed, at any rate at the outset; but it will probably be admitted that an annual expenditure of 7,0001. on the protection of a trade of an annual value of over 1,000,00(B. over a route 490 miles in length is exceedingly moderate, and admits of considerable expansion before rejecting it on the exclusive ground of.cost. On this point, however, a caveat should be entered; it must not be imagined that a force of this character, by mere numerical expansion, can be made capable of undertaking tasks for which its organisation does not fit it. Any expansion in the cadre as proposed should be directed to enabling the force more completely to fulfil the limited functions assigned to it above, and no increase ot strength would enable it to undertake punitive expeditions or the policing of the district as distinct from that of the telegraph line and road. It is very doubtful whether the former task could be satisfactorily performed by any Persian force whatever; but if it is to be attempted it must be by a force organised by military officers on a military basis. That is another proposal which might, if required, be elaborated; the object at present is to make clear that the scheme at present proposed is not of a military but essentially of a civil character. The proposals must of course be taken as absolutely experimental, and based on the broad circumstances of the road. It is probable that experiment would speedily prove the necessity for numerous modifications on points of detail. Moreover, as the conditions on different sections of the road differ radically according to the season, it must be understood that the fullest latitude would have to be practised in the temporary transfer of men from one section or post to another according to the position of the nomad tribes. The reasons for the suggested distribution will be found in the following detailed examination of the conditions of the road from north to south: 2. Distribution. ' (This is shown in tabular form in Table 1 ). Section 1.—Ispahan-Khaneh Khurreh—175 miles; seventy men; head-quarters Abadeh On the northern, or Irak, portion of this section I am not competent to repoit. It would, however, appear from the Ispahan diaries that serious robberies aie not very frequent on this part of the road ; but it is likely that energetic patrolling from Abadeh to Yezdikhast might divert the attention of the Boir Ahmadi marauders to the Irak portion of the road, and for this reason alone it would be necessaiy to apply the scheme to the entire route. How far twenty men at Kumisheh would suffice for this His Majesty’s consul-general at Ispahan will be in a position to estimate. The stretch from Yezdikhast to Abadeh is the most directly dangerous part or the whole road. It is the happy hunting-ground of the Boir Ahmadi tribe, have been entirely beyond control for many years. They have no recognised chief, the last two having been killed by members of the tribe, and no connection with Shnaz, so t at there is no means whatever except force of putting pressure on them. reir win er rendezvous, and market, is Behbehan, which is seldom or nevei undei e e ec ive control of the Persian authorities. They are a small tribe, but enjoy a giea repu a- tion for bravery and marksmanship among the arrant cowards w o compose, wi ew exceptions, the rest of the population of Pars. In October 1908 a party of them waylaid a caravan guarded by Khusrau Khan, Kalantar of^ Surme , wo was e on y headman in that neighbourhood who had shown any capacity foi lesis mg ie _ 10 e . rs ^ and after prolonged rifle-fire killed Khusrau himself and two o iers, an came off a caravan of some sixty mules. They might thus be expec 6 0 0 61 1 ° I K a d llse resistance to the establishment of the new r force, and fifty men e ween ^ a e ai j c Yezdikhast would be none too many to hold them in check. In tact, fifty men wouldbe clearly insufficient were it not for the fact that the twenty men at Kumisheh and the fifty men of the second section could be drawn upon by telephone in case °^ ne No provision has been made for permanent posts between Afcadeh and Dehbid, as this portion of the road is usually quiet, but if found necessary men could be stationec f either at Surmeh or Khaneh Khurreh. Section 2—Khaneh Khurreh-Shiraz—head-quarters bivend ; 137 miles; fifty The governing factor on this section would be the migratory Khamsah tribes. Their firs? appearance north of Shiraz generally takes place about the end of March, at which time it would be necessary to mass the fifty men allotted to this section in the southern portion of it, to proceed gradually northwards to Uehbid as the migration develops. The same course would be followed with the autumn migration. During winter this tract is almost deserted, and thirty at least of the men would be available to reinforce the other sections in case of need. The strength has been fixed as low as possible, and it would depend on the attitude of the tribes how far it would be sufficient, especially as the spring and autumn would also be a time of pressure on the third section, owing to the simultaneous migration of the Kashgai. The_ Khamsah tribes have, however, never given any proof of daring or enterprise, and it is probable that a stern warning to the kalantars that this scheme was intended to be successful, with a hint that, in the event of its failure, other and mere effective means, involving severe penalties for themselves, would be employed, would suffice to prevent anything in the nature of an organised resistance, while fifty men skilfully employed should suffice to provide against the casual marauder, or the marksman choosing a telegraph insulator for his target. Section 3.—Shiraz-Bushire—seventy men ; head-quarters Kazeroon ; 178 miles. The governing factor on this section would be the attitude of the Kashgai, which it is quite impossible to forecast. In the presence of a strong ilkhani, who could be worked upon by means of* the same language as has been suggested above in the case of the Arab kalantars, the Kashgai could probably be trusted to behave themselves, and ninety men would be ample to keep the road protected against the local village thief. Indeed, most of the robberies of late years are traceable to the road-guards themselves. It must be admitted, however, that, in the event of the Kashgais, or several sections of them, being beyond the control of their ilkhani, the force proposed would in itself be quite insufficient to withstand them, but in that case the support of some at least of the headmen and chiefs on the road might be confidently relied on, as these men are in a constant state of feud with the Kashgai. In the extreme south the opposition, open or secret, of the Khan of Borasjoon might be confidently expected, and it would be necessary to warn him plainly that if he proved himself an obstacle to the success of a scheme to be worked by Persians he would be removed if necessary by the employment of a British force. This threat would of course open the door to much talk of concealed intervention, but I regard it as an absolute necessity if the force as constituted is to have any chance of success. The same language would have to be used to the Tangistan chiefs, and the only question on which there may reasonably be some doubt is whether a fourth section under a British officer may not have to be constituted, stretching from Bushire to Daliki bridge, with head-quarters at Borasjoon. 3. Organisation. (A.) Officers .—One European inspector on 400 rupees; two European inspectors on 350 rupees (3,520 tomans). It is clear that the success or failure of the scheme must depend mainly on the qualities of the three European inspectors. As already indicated, the scheme as sketched is not intended to be a military scheme; on the contrary, it is expressly intended as the last and only alternative to the adoption of military measures. This being so, it would be the duty of these officers to know the conditions of their sections thoroughly, to be well acquainted with and respected by the individual chiefs and headmen—to work, in fact, more by diplomacy than by force. In view of the absolute veto on all forms of toll suggested above, their main means of influencing the chiefs would lie in the proposed percentage of 5 per cent, on the pay of the recruits accepted from their village or tribe. This would probably be necessary to prevent the chiefs from putting a veto on recruitment from the outset, and would provide a weapon in the hands of the inspectors, who would be authorised to•■'■.i; .MU 1.1.,-, Jap 5 make deductions from the sum thus raised in the case of misconduct by the headmen concerned. For inspectors a good knowledge of colloquial Persian, experience of Persian ways, &lt; illent bodily health, and great energy would be required. From one point of view the principal enemies of the force would be the gholams themselves, who would naturally be quite unable to understand at first that petty exactions from muleteers constituted a crime punishable by instant dismissal. The inspector would have to be constantly in motion and extremely vigilant. It is clear that such men would require very careful selection, and nothing but pure Europeans of picked quality would be any use. (B.) Armenian Clerks .—Two on 150 rupees, two on 100 rupees (1,120 tomans). These would be necessary as telegraphists and centres of information. They are intended to occupy the offices (at present in telephonic communication only) at Kumisheh, Sivend, Dashtarjin, and Konartakhteh, and would no doubt deal with a certain amount of local traffic. They would also assist the inspector in the clerical work of accounts, &amp;c., which in the case of a force of seventy men would not be inconsiderable, and ought not to be allowed to distract the inspector from his primary duty of constant inspection. (C.) Gholams .—The pay, 12 tomans, includes provision and keep of a horse, these being the terms on which the present gholams are recruited. The senior gholam at each post would be placed in charge and given an allowance of 3 tomans per mensem. They would be recruited by the inspector in their districts. The gholambashis must be able to do all the work of the present gholams in the direction of repairs, &amp;c., and it would probably be possible to make this a condition for the entire force after it had been in existence a few years. The duties of the gholams would be— 1. Constant patrolling of the line and high-road in groups of two or four, according to circumstances. 2. Escorting caravans under the inspector’s orders in case of anticipated robbery. 3. Collection of information relative to intended raids. No drill would be expected of them, but a certain allowance of practice ammunition would be supplied to be fired under the immediate supervision of the inspector. The men would be in uniform and would supply their own horses. 4. Equipment. The only equipment necessary would be rifles, bandoliers, and ammunition. Two telescopes or field glasses per post, to be in charge of the gholambashi, might be allowed. Rifle-racks and ammunition-chests would also be required in each post, with a field telephone. 5. Accommodation. The proposed distribution being avowedly experimental, it would be ad\ isabie to spend as little on buildings as possible until experience has shown where they v ou be mainly required. There can, however, be little doubt as to the suitability of the proposed head-quarters, Abadeh, Sivend, and Kazeroon, at each of which places some building would be necessary. At the other proposed posts there are large buo in many cases ruinous public caravanserais, in which, under present arrangements, a room is usually reserved for the use of the officers of the department. It wou ^. u .^ hardship on the travelling public, but, on the contrary, a consideia _e a. \aimage, i i entailed a certain amount of repairs, for several rooms to be similarly reserved for the use of the new force. ^ The buildings proposed need little explanation. At Abadeh, the head-quarters of a European officer with thirty men, both a house and gholams pprar^ers vou e necessary ; at Sivend there is already ample accommodation for t le o cei. ant a a would be required would be quarters for the men ; while at Kazeroon it is proposed to begin by constructing quarters for the officer and housing the men a m one 0 , . numerous large caravanserais existing in the town.

I am to inform you, in reply, that the suggestion made by the principal houses t Manchester which are interested in Persian trade, as set forth m their letter to your chamber will be carefully considered by His Majesty’s Government m conjunction wit™ the' various proposals now under discussion for putting an end to the present state of insecurity in those regions. ^ ^ 'p. A. CAMPBELL. [2412 —4]iThis Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government,] dated the 18th August. The question of the appointment of road guards for the security of trade, which the Secretary of State regards as encompassed with difficulties, the principal one being that of expense, has again been considered by the board in conjunction with the merchants principally concerned. The enclosed letter, signed by the principal houses in the Persia trade, states their views on this particular point and suggests a method of meeting it which is approved by the board. The directors think it probable that if the means suggested, viz., a toll or charge for the use of the roads, proportionate to the distance travelled—with the specific object of meeting the expense of guarding—were adopted, it would remove the main objection of the Persian authorities, and might indeed be welcomed by them as indicating a means for restoring, as soon as possible, ordinary peaceful and commercial avocations. I am to express the hope that this proposal commends itself to the Secretary of State and that he will be able to give it his support. WE are greatly obliged by your sending us the copy of the reply to the petition on the state of affairs in mid and southern Persia, and are gratified to learn that this matter is having the serious attention of His Majesty s Government. We note that the chief difficulty in the way of establishing a system of road guards to protect the trade routes is the raising of funds for the payment of these men s wages. We are well aware, from conversations with His Majesty’s consuls m Persia, that it has been very definitely laid down that in no manner whatever or undei any name at all are the octroi duties formerly in force in Persia to be re-established. However, we do not think there can be any objection to the establishment of a system o to s at various stations along the caravan routes on the principle that the goods s ou pay tolls according to the distance travelled; thus, goods destined for Shiraz or instance, would pay less than goods destined for Tehran. We ieel convince ia an arrangement of this sort would present no insuperable difficulties, anc ^ we now as a result of many conversations with native Persian merchants m various parts of Persia that they would gladly pay these tolls if they weie guaian ee t e sa e PERSIA.

[34173] No. 1. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received September 13.) (No. 162.) Sir, Gulahek, August 24, 1909. I HAAE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your despatch No.^lO of the 24th ultimo. My Russian colleague informs me that his Government maintain no guards on the Julfa-Tabreez and Resht-Tehran roads, but I need hardly point out that the condition of these roads is very different from that of those in the south. So far as my experience goes, the Resht-Tehran road has always been perfectly safe, and in normal times the same may be said of the road from Julfa to Tabreez. I had hoped before this to have the advantage of discussing with His Majesty’s consul-general at Bushire the question of the better protection of trade on the southern roads, but Major Cox who had intended to pass through Tehran in July on his way home has been obliged to postpone his leave until now, and as he desires to be in England as soon as possible, I have concurred in his proposal that he should proceed direct to England, and that he should defer his visit to Tehran until his return j journey in November. You will thus have an opportunity of seeing him before I shall, J and as you may wish to discuss with him the proposal mentioned in my despatch No.^122, I transmit papers regarding it. Since my despatch above mentioned, I have again talked over this scheme with Mr. Barker, who, while quite ready to co-operate, thinks it would be unwise for his department, which has hitherto adopted a non-militant attitude, to play the militant part it is proposed by Mr. Bill to allot to it, and is very doubtful if such a proposal will meet with the approval of the head of his department. Apart from the question of the cost, which, of course, need not necessarily fall on the department, but could be met by funds specially set aside for the purpose, there must always remain the serious objection that the police work would provoke the hostility of the tribesmen with whom it is obviously to the department’s interest to keep on good terms. In case, however, the Indo-European Telegraph Department should look with favour on the proposal, I have requested Mr. Bill, as suggested by him, to sketch the details of a scheme in consultation with the telegraph assistant superintendent at Shiraz. Not having had the advantage of considering the matter with the assistance of Major Cox, I feel some diffidence in expressing an opinion, but I am inclined to think that, failing the organisation of a force of road guards under British officers which would certainly be the most effective plan, the best—as it certainly would be the most expeditious—remedy for the present situation would be to interest the tribes in the maintenance of order. Subsidies to the tribal chiefs and payment of the tribesmen employed, provided regularity of payment were ensured, would, I think, have most beneficial results. The experience of the Bakhtiari road, which on account of its relative security is now absorbing much of the traffic of the Bushire—Ispahan road, is all in favour of such a scheme. I take it the Persian Government could designate without difficulty the various tribes which could best be entrusted with the work. Regularity of payment is, of course, a condition precedent of efficiency, and this could be best secured by entrusting the work of paying the chiefs and the tribesmen employed to the officers of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, who being stationed along the roads most in need of guards are conveniently placed for the work. Even if the objections of the Russian Government could be overcome to the introduc tion of British military officers for the organisation of a force of road guards and it must be remembered that the road most in need of improvement, i.c., the Bushire— Ispahan route, lies entirely in the neutral zone—I presume that we should have some difficulty in persuading the Persian Government to consent to it. On the other, the utilisation for the purpose indicated of British telegraph officers who are^ already in the country, and who from the nature of their service and from their distribution throughout the country are peculiarly suited for dealing with the tribes could hardly be open to objection from either country. [2412 n—] B x/ \ BOf the methods suggested by Mr. Bill of raising the funds for defraying the cost of the maintenance of order, a surcharge on the customs would, if it be negotiated, clearly be the easier, but should there be insuperable objections to this course, we might insist on the assignment of the receipts of one of the southern ports for thef^ purpose. Without some fund specially allocated the necessary regularity of payment could not be assured, but even were this done it would be some time before it could produce funds for inaugurating any seheme, and whatever plan His Majesty’s Government decide to urge upon the Persian Government, it would probably be desirable to make the cost of starting its working a first charge on any loan to he made to the Persian Government. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. Inclosure 1 in No. 1. Consul-General Grahame to Sir G. Barclay. (No. 23.) Sir, Ispahan, March 10, 1909. I HAVE the honour to submit for your consideration a copy of a letter addressed under date of the 17th October, 1908, by Messrs. H. C. Dixon, of Manchester, to their representative in Ispahan, Mr. Kay, by whom it was brought to my attention a few days ago. Messrs. Dixon suggest that patrols—preferably of telegraph gholams—might with advantage be employed to go up and down the Bushire road, not so much with a view to themselves arresting robbers as of giving notice by means of field telephones of the presence and number of robbers, thus facilitating the dispatch of soldiers. In my conversation with Mr. Kay I pointed out the many and obvious difficulties attaching to the execution of any project of the nature of that suggested by .Messrs. Dixon. I also mentioned that some time ago I made proposals for certain measures to be taken by His Majesty’s Government for the better security of the Bushire road, but that these have been unfavourably viewed both by His Majesty’s Minister (Sir C. Spring-Rice) and by the Foreign Office. I undertook, however, to bring Messrs. Dixon’s suggestions under your con sideration. It may not be out of place here to mention that 1 have noted in the course of the last few years an increasing feeling among British mercantile men in Persia that the steps hitherto taken with regard to the robberies of British merchandise on the Bushire road have ceased to be adequate, and that the increasing frequency of these and the inability or unwillingness of the Persian Government to bring the culprits to justice would, in their opinion, make it desirable that His Majesty’s Government should consider what other measures it might be prepared to take in the interests of British trade in Persia. 1 am now addressing a copy of this despatch and inclosure to His Maiesty’s consul at Shiraz. J J I have, &amp;c. G. GRAHAME. Inclosure 2 in No. 1 . (N 18 ) Acting Consul Bill to Sir G. Barclay. r Shiraz / 4 nrif 21 1909 _ WITH reference to my despatch No. 23, dated the 10 th MarchA 909, from His ajesty s consul-general at Ispahan to your address, a copy of which was forwarded to me,^ ave the honour to offer for your consideration the following observations on this subject, with a suggestion towards a remedy. I must, in the first place, emphatically endorse the statement made by Mr. Grahame in the letter above quoted, in relation to the increasing feeling among British firms that the steps taken with regard to the robbery of British goods on the Bushire road have ceased to be adequate, and that it has consequently become desirable that His Majesty’s Government should consider what other steps it might be prepared to take in the interests of British trade in Persia. In this connection, I have the honour to forward3 for your information a copy of my reply to Mr. Grahame, and to invite a reference to my despatch No. 88 , dated the 19th December, 1908. It appears to me to be a matter of urgent importance that His Majesty’s Government should be fully aware that under ^resent circumstances there appears to be no prospect whatever of any considerable or jrmanent improvement in the present conditions of transport from Bushire to Ispahan, and that to all appearances a volume of British and British Indian trade, which reached in the year 1907-1908 a total value of 1,200,000/., will continue to be exposed not only to direct depredation, but also to increasingly oppressive charges arising out of the exactions and misconduct of the headmen and roadguards who prey every year more severely on this commerce. A point which might, I think, be emphasised with advantage is that, although no doubt this road has always been exposed in some degree to these evils, the situation in the past year or two has changed in a very important particular. Formerly outbursts of lawlessness upon this road were the outcome either of local feuds or of intrigue by some powerful personages designed to discredit someone or other of the local authorities, and such outbursts tended to subside on the removal of the exciting cause. The present state of things is, in my diagnosis at least, widely different: it is simply due to the fact that the individual nomads, and to a less degree the villagers, have realised the almost complete incapacity of the Imperial authority to inflict any punishment for either robberies or illegal exactions; and it is obvious enough that this fact renders the solution of the problem far more difficult, and wholly beyond the capacity of any authority which the Persian Government has it in its power to establish. In saying this I have not overlooked the possibility that the success of the constitutional movement may induce some of the nomad chiefs to exert themselves to maintain order within their sphere; but a genuine amelioration of the conditions of transport by this means appears to me in the last degree improbable, and in a matter of such vital importance it is incumbent, I think, upon British consular authorities not only to prepare His Majesty’s Government for the failure of such attempts, but to lay before them concrete proposals for a remedy. I imagine that a few months now will be sufficient to demonstrate clearly the truth of the opinion which Mr. Grahame and I have already expressed, namely, that the employment of some form of special force, organised and paid under foreign supervision, is absolutely the only alternative to the perpetuation and aggravation of existing disorders. With this in view, it may perhaps be held that Messrs. Dixon’s suggestion, in itself impracticable, contains the germ of a more effective system. The annual losses of the Indo-European Telegraph Department by wilful damage to the line have increased very considerably in the last few years, and this sum, amounting as I am informed to some 16,000 krans in Fars alone for the year 1908, has to be provided by the Persian Government. It is probable, therefore, that the latter would not look with disfavour upon a scheme which, while in no way interfering with its sovereign rights, would it the same time relieve it from this annually increasing expenditure, and would also satisfy the clamorous demands of Persian merchants for the security of their merchandise. Such a scheme might be begun in a tentative manner by the gradual establishment, as part of the ordinary staff* of the telegraph department, of a force of well-armed and well-mounted gholams. Parties of these would be continually on the move between the various telegraph stations, and being provided with portable telephones would be able to summon reinforcements with the least possible delay. Their primary object would, of course, be the protection of the telegraph line, and their mere presence, in sufficient force to resist any ordinary party of marauders, would probably have a very considerable deterrent effect on the robbers. _ But they might further be empowered to take charge of caravans in a fixed proportion of mu es pei man of the escort, some due being fixed, half of which would be collected at the point of departure and half at the point of arrival by the European officials of the ^ I have' not discussed any such proposals with any members of the department, and it is possible any system of the kind might be considered to he too far beyond the proper sphere of their activities ; but if you should consider the idea worth following up I should be quite prepared, in consultation with the assistant supeiintendent, Shnaz (of course with the permission of the director), to elaborate the details of such a scheme. It would probably necessitate the employment of one or two additional European officers, at ? any rate for the first few years, but I fancy it could be made to a arge extent, if not entirely, self-supporting, and I believe that no other system wo combine in the same degree the efllcient protection of the road with a due respect for [2412 n—41 132the internal independence of Persia, to the maintenance of which His Majesty’s Government is so firmly pledged. At all events I have felt it my^ duty to lay the alternatives clearly before you, in the hope that it may be found possible, either by the adoption of some such scheme as that sketched above or by some other means, to give to a branch of British trade, which even under present conditions is far fro/^ unimportant, that minimum of ordinary security which alone is required to ensure its prosperous development. I am forwarding a copy of this despatch to His Majesty s resident at Bushire and consul-general, Ispahan. I have, &amp;c. J. H. BILL. Inclosure 3 in No. 1. Acting Consul Bill to Consul-General Grahame. (No. 6 .) Sir, Shiraz, March 24, 1909. I HAVE the honour to acknowledge with thanks receipt of your despatch No. 3, dated the 10 th March, 1909, and to enclose in reply a copy of my despatch No. 88 , dated the 19th December, 1908, to the address of His Majesty’s Legation. 2 . From this you will see that I have already been obliged to renew the recommendations made by yourself during your tenure of this post, and I continue of opinion that no other method offers much chance of permanent success. One drawback to Messrs. Dixon’s proposal, which has probably occurred to you, would be that the tribesmen already understand the meaning of a field telephone, and even under present conditions do not always respect the persons of the telegraph gholams; and if they once understand that the gholams had standing orders to report their misdeeds the service of the latter would become so dangerous that men would not be found willing to undertake it. Unless, therefore, the proposed system were adopted merely as an unobtrusive method of 'introducing the regular employment of a force of road guards as already recommended by yourself, I fear it would be neither acceptable to the telegraph department nor effective in the suppression of road robberies. 1 fear, therefore, that unless the revolutionary movement in Shiraz would have the effect of inducing the nomad chiefs to charge themselves effectively with the protection of the road, there is no alternative to the present disastrous condition of affairs but to press on the adoption of your original proposals. I have, &amp;c. J. H. BILL. Inclosure 4 in No. 1 . V Memorandum on despatch No. 18 of 1909 from Acting Consul Bill to Sir G. Barclay. THE proposal made by His Britannic Majesty’s consul at Shiraz, that the Indo- European Telegraph Department shall engage in policing the Bushire-Ispahan road is one in which a good many factors have to be considered. To begin with, under article 2 of the convention between Great Britain and Persia, dated the 2 nd December, 1872, the employes of the department are placed under the special protection of the Persian Government. If, therefore, the department reverses this obligation and takes to protecting, it will go far to abrogate its right to be protected, a right which, however ineffective now, is one which should not be lightly given up. Another consideration is the financing of the scheme. To be strong enough to protect the travellers on 500 miles of road a very large increment to the existing staff will be required—there are at present some twenty gholams on the section in question ; to be in any way effective that number must at the lowest computation be multiplied by ten, commanded by additional European officers. It seems hardly likely that merchants will submit to the imposition of dues which would cover the cost of so large an establishment. After Nasr-ed-Din Shah’s death in 1896 the country from Ispahan to Bushire was as disturbed as it is now, but it settled down to comparative quiet in a short time. The same may occur again, and the services of a special police be no longer required. The department would then find itself with a staff much beyond its necessities, and no dueswoUxd be coming in to cover the extra cost. To reduce the staff to normal dimensions would prove difficult, and a considerable sum might have to be disbursed from British and Indian revenues in the way of compensation or in gratuities. /■•-'n Apart from petty damages, the lines have been allowed to stand through the oubles of the past two or three years. This immunitv from serious damage is as much a matter of astonishment to the departmental officers as it is to everyone else, and proves that the country generally has no quarrel with the department. If the departmental attitude changes it is possible such change may operate adversely, and the regard now shown for it may be turned into resentment, and lead to tbe wholesale destruction of portions of the lines. Other points to which attention may be drawn are— (1.) That there will be more risk of injury to employes, European and native, than there is at present is obvious ; those exposed to such risks will therefore require extra pay to cover the cost of insurance &amp;c., before they undertake them. (2.) So large an increase of the personnel will throw much extra work on the direction, consequently additional office establishment will be required to cope with it. (3.) The department recovers sooner or later the cost of petty damages to the line, therefore the advantage to it claimed in the proposal is not of much account. It is calculated that the scheme would cost at the lowest computation 3,000 tomans a month, viz.:— Tomans. Two .Europeans, at (say) 125 tomans .. .. .. .. .. 250 Horse allowance, at (say) 12 tomans .. .. .. .. .. 24 Two hundred men, at (say) 6 tomans .. .. .. .. .. 1,200 Two hundred horse allowances, at (say) 12 tomans .. .. .. 1,200 Contingencies .. .. .. .. .. .. .. 326 3,000 Sav between £6,000 and £7,000 a-year, according to the rate of exchange. J B, C. BARKER. Inclosure 5 in No. 1. Acting Consul Bill to Sir G. Barclay (No. 29.) +ij 7 H q g* r ^ Shiraz, July 7, 1909. ’ WITH reference to your despatch No. 122 , dated the 15th June, 1909, to the address of His Majesty’s Secretary of State, of which I have been favoured with a copy, I venture to offer a few remarks on the position which I understand the director of the telegraph department has taken up on the subject. In the first place I fully accept Mr. Barker’s estimate of the annual^ extra expenditure which is very much the same as that which I. had myself anticipated. I would, however, observe that the Persian merchants of Shiraz have already agreed to pay Soulet-ed-Dowleh 17,000 tomans per annum (3,400/.) for a very unsatisfactory undertaking to police the Firuzabad route from Shiraz to Bushire. It is not therefore, probable that they would raise any objections to paying, roughly double the sum for an efficient police system over the entire route from Ispahan. Such a sum, I may add, would amount to a total charge of little over i per cent, on the total average trade of Bushire for the last three years, and a little over 1 per cent, if charged on the imports only. It should also be noted that the cost of the existing gholams and the annual charge for wilful damage should also be deducted from the total estimated cost 2. The proposal is, however, open to one very serious criticism on «ie administra tive side. The idea originally suggested m my despatch No. 18, dated the 21st April 1909, was that the muleteers should place themselves under te pro ec ion of the gholams, and that the dues should be paid either by them or by the consignees of the goods. Even setting aside the difficulty of obtaining cash payments _ from sdhtrcr s tfc : I would suggest' that provisionally at least the cost of the scheme should be covered6 by a single impost to be charged on imports alone at the port of Bushire. It might even with the consent of the Powers interested be levied as a general surtax on the existing customs duty and paid directly by the Customs to the telegraph department. This suggestion would, of course, entail a certain amount of negotiation, but it would at the same time place the system upon a thoroughly sound financial basis whil^ avoiding an enormous number of difficulties in detail. 3. The exemption of export trade, while not perhaps theoretically justifiable, would have the advantage of putting a slight premium on exports, the encouragement of which is so eminently desirable in the interests of trade; but should objections be raised there would be no particular difficulty in realising the charge on arrival at Bushire either at a special barrier or at the custom-house itself. 4. In conclusion, I venture to repeat the principal theses of my former despatch, viz. : («) the discovery and application of some effective remedy is a matter of very urgent necessity in the interests of the British and Persian Governments equally; (b) no remedy is likely to be efficient which does not include constant and competent European supervision; and (c) under no other system could such supervision be provided with less disturbance of existing conditions and greater respect for the sovereignty of the Persian Government. I have, &amp;c. J. H. BILL.notf; on the state of the bushire+shiraz road, August 1909. A fact about the present condition (of insecurity) of the Bushi re~Kazerun-Shiraz road which seems to call for more attention than it has yet received was pointed out to me by Mr. Mackerdich at Borasjun * He told me that for some time past men of the villages on the road have been realising all their available capital in order to buy a rifle, they then adopt the profession of tofangchi and prey on the kafilas using the road. Their livelihood depends on the road being used as a trade route, but their numbers and their extortions and thefts tend to make commerce impossible * Soulet-ed-Douleh*s recent action with regard to the Firouzabad route has resulted in all the traffic being deviated from the Kazerun route, and the tofangchis on the latter road are now reduced to desperate straits, and in order to bring the kafilas bacjp to their own road they are moving over in bands to rob on the Firouzabad route so as to make the latter even more hazardous than the former. The important point is thqt there are now about 2000 men on the Bushire~Kazerun road who have sunk thei ' all in the purchase of a rifle and have no possible means of earning a living save by extorting money from charvadars and by petty thefts of merchandise, and it would seem that they will have to be taken into consideration when any scheme for the policing or protection of the road is being formulated. On my journey donn from Shiraz accompanied by 5 sowarsijmsi 'S&gt; sowars of the 12th Cavalry, when passing through Deris near Kazeran I was surrounded by a party of about 20 t ofang chi s d&amp;nandmg money* When I refused to pay anything f one tofangchi covered me with his rifle and I have no doubt my caravan would have been robbed but for the presence of the sowars. Mr. Macherdich says that the tofangchis will continue to live by plunder and extortion until the import of cartridges into Southern Persia is stopped* The reinforcement marching to Shiraz was the first caravan to use the road for four months, and charvadars in Shiraz refused to use the route unless escorted, the brutality of the tofangchis being dreaded by them as much as extortion.

(No. 7. Commercial.) Sir, Bushirje.July 18, 1909. I HAVE the honour to place before you a memorandum on theffjvailing condition of the trade routes within the sphere of my post, more especially of the Bushire-Shiraz route, drawn up for me by His Majesty’s vice-consul. I am well aware that His Majesty’s Government are generally cognisant of the deplorable condition of insecurity into which all the main arteries of traffic in Southern Persia have been thrown by the chronic state of chaos and anarchy under which the country has been labouring for the past three years. The subject was one of those specially commended to attention in my letter to the address of the Government of India and His Majesty’s Minister dated the 6th June, 1908 ; since then we have taken the opportunity afforded by the visit of Mr. Charles Akers to the Persian Gulf, to report upon commercial matters to the Foreign Office and the Board of Trade, to urge him to represent at Tehran, and if possile in London, how fundamentally the prospects of our commerce in this region are bound up with and depend upon the question of security on the main caravan routes leading from the coast of the Persian Gulf to the chief trading centres of the interior. The situation in the capital has now reached a well-marked stage, at which it seems possible that an opening may at any time offer itself for some definite action or form of co-operation on our part with the central Government, in whatever form it may- now be, for the restoration of order or the financing of reforms. I trust, therefore, that the present moment may not prove inopportune for the submission of the present note on the commercial outlook. It may, I think, be taken for granted, from the variety of suggestions and schemes which have been put forward by different officers of Government for policing the trade routes, that there are several methods by which a reasonable measure of security could be provided ; but it is difficult to offer useful comment in regard to the details or relative advantages of individual schemes, until His Majesty’s Government feel in a position to give their representatives some idea of the extent and general lines of co-operation or disguised intervention which their present policy renders feasible. Pending that time I can do little more than urge upon them the pressing necessity which appears to me, from the local point of view, to exist for the inauguration of some reasonably effective measure for rescuing the several important British firms engaged in the trade to Southern Persia, via the Gulf ports, from the veritable slough of despond into which they are slowly sinking. Failing some early step on the part of Government in this direction, one cannot but feel convinced that they will be forced to resign themselves to retirement from the field—an ominous contingency, which I should witness with great regret and dismay. A copy of this despatch is being submitted to His Majesty’s Minister. I have, &amp;c. P. Z. COX, Major, British Resident in the Persian Gulf, and His Britannic Majesty's Consul-General for Ears, fyc. CONFIDENTIAL. [29933] Consul- Inclosure in No. 1. Memorandum respecting the Disorders on the Trade Routes of Southern Persia. THE state of trade in Southern Persia is at the present time most seriously affecting British interests. This is especially true of Ears. The result of two years fighting amongst the Kashgai, Lur, and Arab tribes in the neighbourhood of Shiraz, and along the caravan routes leading to that trade centre ivas, in the irst p ace, to [2377 7—111 arender the dispatch of goods into the districts normally fed by Shiraz quite unsafe ''and, in consequence, to cause an overflooding and congestion of goods in Shiraz itself This market, like that of Bushire, has subsisted for years almost entirely on British credit; during the current period of unrest bills have had to be met, and to find money goods have had to be disposed of, usually at a heavy loss. On the.otb/^ hand, the British firms have found outstandings ever harder and harder to get in, anu at the best their accounts are often only partially settled. In addition to the insecurity prevailing round Shiraz and along the Ispahan road and the outlying buying centres,“bad harvests and the political troubles have further undermined the position of all trade in Southern Persia. , Two-and-a-half years of this state of affairs have damaged' the stability of most Persian tinders ; there has been no chance of making losses good ; many bankruptcies have occurred in Bushire, and enquiries at which I have been present have brought home to me the heavy losses incurred by some British firms, and the jeopardy into which the capital, which all firms have outstanding, is already thrown. A British Indian firm of Bombay, established for more than fifty years in Bussorah and Bushire, is closing up its Bushire branch. Messrs. David Sassoon and Co. (Limited) had, so I understood, some time ago more than 50,COOL outstanding from their Bushire office, though this has since been considerably reduced ; and we were informed at one time that this very old house in Persia were threatening to withdraw altogether unless something was done to help British trade over the Shiraz route. Messrs. Dixon and Co. have large sums outstanding due to their Bushire office alone, and their affairs in Ispahan are said to be in an unsatisfactory position. Messrs. Livingstone, Zeytoon, and Co. (Limited), a new firm, have found their venture so far quite unprofitable. Messrs. Gray, Paul, and Co. have practically ceased dealing in merchandise, and confine themselves to the work of a shipping agency. Piece-goods have not been coming forward in any quantity for the past three months. The year March 1908-9 has seen the import of Manchester goods alone into Butdme ieduced from 439,9o il. to 318,375L ; the year 1909—10 promises to be infinitely worse, the first quarter’s figures being only 41,585h It cannot be denied that the commercial supremacy of Great Britain in Southern Persia and the districts bordering the Gulf has gained greatly in importance owing to recent developments of the political situation. It therefore seems all the more necessary for us to come to the assistance of existing British commercial institutions, ^ and enable them to tide over the present critical period of anarchy, in Southern Persia. . . 1 his cannot be done, unless some definite commercial policy is adopted by the British authorities, and early action taken to give effect to it. The question on which everything primarily hinges is the safety of the caravan routes. I he importance of this has been repeatedly pressed by one officer after another even when the province of Pars was in relatively good order, and the matter is tar more urgent now. The proclamation, or even the inception, of a constitution does not in itself offer any probability of the slightest improvement in the safety of the Bushire-Shiraz and the bunder Abbas-Kerman routes. It must take years to bring Ears back to a condition ot reasonable security and prosperity. Banger of Encroachment by Russian Trade. vi fhM the continuance of disturbance along those arteries of trade, o-i- 1 G j? lmis m g e P 1 g 0 °ds of British origin, tends to open markets like Yezd, naz, } erman, and Ispahan to the descent of Russian trade from the north; and His ajes ^ s cons at verman has recently complained that Russian cotton-goods have been displacing British because of the insecurity on the Bunder Abbas route. Extortion by Ehans along Roads. ind lc c aI chieftains along the 180 miles of the'Bushire-Shiraz road have become epen en o e governor-general of Pars, and are in a constant state of warfare eac o er. ne posts are tampered with and robbed every few weeks. Despite the specific engagement entered into by the Persian Government in the convention of 1903, article 4, rahdari is extorted by armed tribesmen 0n ^i i 6 1C J U e m e y er - m creasing amounts. A statement of these exactions is PP en ° ! * ' sum of 1 bran is even extracted by the Kalantar at the gate of Bushire,3 and when protest was made in 1907 the local governor simply replied that he was powerless, as the Minister of I inance still included this item in the schedule of revenue which the governors of Bushire have to make good ; if the Persian Government would erase the item from the schedule, he, the governor, would cause the levy to be Continued. Caravans are liable to be molested at all points and on every route leading from Bushire. The deviation from Shief, situated 9 miles from Bushire by sea, has been alluded to in all recent trade reports. It is shunned by all British and the principal Persian merchants on account of its many inconveniences and reputation for pilferages. The khan of Angoli, desirous of the caravan route passing through his territory—the exclu sive right of which lie has for three years past tried to obtain by large bribes offered to local governors—loses no opportunity which fortune or a weak governor may place in his way of coercing muleteers, by imposts or by detention of mules, into using the Shief-Daliki road. ^ Only lately he exacted a fine of 50 tomans (approximately 10Z.) besides “ rahdari dues from an unprotected caravan of 70 mules, which was approaching Bushire by the main route, which borders on his land. State of the Main Route. The u Imperial ” road, passing through Borazjun, Daliki, and up the mountains to Kazerun, now in use for many years past, has been blocked for the last two months by the great feud which has joined the khan of Kumarij and the headman of Daliki and the khan of Borazjun. Report says that disputes about the passage of caravans have been the origin of the feud. Fighting has been heavy, and the narrow passes in the hands of the combatants. The dangers of the present situation are shown by the recent firing on the Russian acting consul-general, although he was travelling with an escort of Cossacks. The telegraph office at Konar Takhte has been a centre for opera tions. In 1908 the unrest was focussed a little further on, between Kumarij and Kazerun; 1907 was marked by troubles in the Kashgai tribe between Kazerun and Shiraz and by a series of postal robberies. The main route being so hampered for traffic, native merchants in Shiraz have been of late endeavouring to arrange with the Kashgai Bkhani for the transport of caravans by the Firuzabad route, which, in its course to Bushire, traverses Dashti territory, a district inhabited by a very lawless population, and Tangistan. The absence of the telegraph on this route and the likelihood of robbery occurring without the slightest chance of compensation being obtained, and other difficulties in the shape of dearth of forage, provisions, and caravan accommodatiou make British merchants very chary of trusting their goods to it. Dearth of Transport. Another serious feature has been the dearth of mule transport which has arisen. Muleteers have been so ill-treated and so plagued by robbers and “ roadguards ” during the past two years that a very large number have forsaken the route altogether and gone to the Yezd road or even more north still, to the Resht road. The result is that even when a short spell of comparative tranquillity does occur, merchants cannot depend upon being able to get transport. Whereas in 1905 from 5,000 to 7,000 mules are stated to have been constantly; engaged between Bushire and Shiraz, now in 1909 a British forwarding agency and Persian mule-brokers estimate them at between 2,000 and 3,000. Some 1,500 Shiraz mules are stated to have forsaken the Bushire road for the Resht and Kermanshah routes (which are not in the British sphere of influence). No large caravan had come down from Shiraz to Bushire from March to June 1909, and then only via Firuzabad. Price of Transport. The price of transport has risen to such an extent that it has become a burden on trade. [2377 i—11] B 2The following figures show clearly the rise from the normal since the period of anarchy commenced * Krans. per 737 lb., 185 miles .. .. .. 90, 80, 60 95-80-100-110 1900 1901 1902 1904 1905 March 1906-7 „ 1907-8 „ 1908-9 „ 1909-10 (Or a rise from, approximately, 1/. 9s. to 5/. 3s.) 80 80-90 85-95-75-95-110 150-220-140-150 160-120-110-90-140 140-160-170-220 200-250-300 Insurance. A further proof oi the straits to which _ commerce has been reduced along the bhiraz load is shown in the premium rates of insurance companies in England. Formerly 15s. per 100Z. was accepted by most underwriters for cotton bales from Manchester to Shiraz and Ispahan, and included risk of robbery. In 1907 the rate was dOs., I think; while in 1908 the long list of robberies had sent the rate up to 40s and very tew companies could be found to accept the risk. By April 1909 practically all insurance to Shiraz was refused in England, war risks being asked, which means 5Z. to 10Z. per 100Z. The result is that the risk of robbery between Bushire and Shiraz falls on the British exporter, not on the insurance company as hitherto, nor on the Persian buyer. Recovery of Claims. Recovery of claims was, up till 1906, frequently effected from the Pars Government, Dut during the last eighteen months claims for British merchandise stolen on the ushirc Shiraz road, with a value of 3,810 tomans (approximately 6201.), have been adtinc ThA v d n UnaMe “ de 1 t0 by the Persian authorities.

Interest and Importance attached to Bushire Road. Finally, in emphasising the especial interest which British commerce and British policy have in the Bushire-Shiraz route, one point deserves mention. There appears to be some apprehension that it is desired to promote the diversion of traffic from the Gulf to Ispahan to the Ahwaz-Ispahan route (Lynch’s concession) m preference to the Bushire road, as more important; to British interests. It is true that a certain amount of cargo destined for transport via Shiraz has, owing to the recent perilous condition of the latter road, had to be reshipped to Ahwaz, but, on the whole, the relative importance of the two routes for the transport of British goods and the spread of British trade is not to be compared. The Ahwaz-Ispahan route is hampered by snow for a considerable period during the winter season, it possesses no caravanserais nor telegraph facilities, and, more particularly, it passes through no large trading centres or trading populations on its course to Ispahan. the Bushire load, on the other hand, traverses Borazjun and Kazerun, an agricultural centre, on its way to Shiraz, and’ north of Shiraz it proceeds via Abadeh and Kumeshah to Ispahan. To some extent the Yezd market is also dependent on this route. For some generations past the trading instincts along this road have been encouraged, and there are now flourishing native commercial communities, with great interdependence of interests, in Bushire, Shiraz, and Ispahan, of which the forwarding system is not the least. ^ n , , t-&gt; -u ur But the basis of the prosperity of all three towns is largely British credit, witn which business is carried on, and, were the normal transport of merchandise to Ispahan by the Bushire road to be transferred permanently, or for any length of time, to the Ahwaz route, British trade and capital in Shiraz and Bushire must, m my judgment, inevitably suffer.

The above points to an increase of 11-30 krans per mnle since 1907, and it may be noted that it shows rahdari and other illegal taxes exacted as far as Kazernn only i.e., 100 miles of the jonrney. The sum of 15 krans per mule over this distance is equivalent to 5s. 2&gt;d. for considerably less than 3 cwt. A further system of robbery resorted to by the village chieftains along the route is to prohibit muleteers from buying fodder for any one else than themselves, and then to charge them double the market price.

I have the honour to place before you a Memorandum on the prevailing condition of the trade routes within the sphere of my post—more especially of the Bushire-Shiraz route—drawn up for me by His Majesty’s Vice-Consul. I am well aware that His Majesty’s Government are generally cognizant of the deplorable condition of insecurity into which all the main arteries of traffic in Southern Persia have been thrown by the chronic state of chaos and anarchy under which the country has been labouring for the past three years. The subject was one of those specially commended to attention in my letter No. 1726-1727 to the address of the Government of India and His Majesty’s Minister, dated 6th June 1908 ; since then we have taken the opportunity afford ed by the visit of Mr. Charles Akers to the Persian Gulf to report upon commercial matters to the Foreign Office and the Board of Trade, to urge him to represent at Tehran, and if possible in London, how fundamentally the prospects of our commerce in this region are bound up with and depend upon the question of security on the main caravan routes leading from the coast of the Persian Gulf to the chief trading centres of the interior. The situation in the Capital has now reached a well-marked stage at which it seems possible that an opening may at any time offer itself for some definite action or form of co-operation on our part with the Central Government, in what ever form it may now be, for the restoration of order or the financing of reforms. I trust, therefore, that the present moment may not prove inopportune for the submission of the accompanying note on the commercial outlook. It may, I think be taken for granted from the variety of suggestions and schemes which have been put forward by different officers of Government for policing the trade routes, that there are several methods by which a reasonable measure of security could be provided ; but it is difficult to offer useful comment in regard to the details or relative advantages of individual schemes until His Maiesty’s Government feel in a position to give their representatives some idea of the extent and general lines of co-operation of disguised intervention which their present policy renders feasible. Pending that time I can do little more than urge upon them the pressing necessity which appears to me from the local point of view to exist for the inauguration of some reasonably effective measure for rescuing the several impor tant British firms engaged in the trade to Southern Persia v,a the Gulf Ports from the veritable slough of despond into which they are slowly sinking. Failing some early step on the part of Gavernment in this direction one cannot but feel convinced that they will be forced to resign themselves to retire ment from the field, an ominous contingency which I should witness with great regret and dismay. . _ .. .

I HAVE received your despatch No. 122 of the 15th ultimo, discussing a proposal for the provision of adequate protection for trade in the roads of Southern Persia, a subject also treated in your despatch No. 13, Commercial, of the 16th May last. I consider the proposal to he in itself an excellent one, but it is clear that, before steps can be taken to give practical effect to it, it must become the subject of an exchange of views with the Russian Government. Before, however, submitting it to their consideration, I have thought it well to obtain the opinion of His Majesty’s Ambassador at St. Petersburgh, at present on leave of absence in this country, as to the attitude which they are likely to adopt towards it. Sir A. Nicolson has now informed me that he does not anticipate that the Russian Government will raise any objections to the scheme as far as the British zone is concerned, but his Excellency considers that, before broaching the subject at St, Petersburgh, it would be well to ascertain whether the Russian Government themselves maintain any guards on the Julfa-Tabreez and Resht-Tehran roads, and, if so, how they are organised and paid. I have accordingly to request you to endeavour to obtain this information and forward it to me in due course. As regards the neutral zone, the Russian Government w^ould no doubt wish to be consulted,'while, in Sir A. Nicolson’s opinion, the Persian Government might raise objections to any scheme involving the employment of road guards under British officers. I am, &amp;c. E.

WITH reference to your despatch No. 219 of the 24th December last, inclosing copies of Correspondence with Messrs. Dixon in regard to the insecurity of trade routes in Southern Persia, I have the honour to report that Messrs. Dixon at the same time instructed their representative at Ispahan to discuss with His Majesty’s consul-general a proposal for policing the roads similar to that submitted to you, but with the difference that the firm suggested the employment of telegraph gholams for the purpose instead of that of India soldiers. . His Majesty’s consul at Shiraz, to whom Mr. Grahame forwarded copies o± Messrs. Dixon’s letter, and to their agent, and of his own covering despatch to me, has now approached me urging the pressing necessity for introducing some adequate measures of policing the roads. Mr. Bill, who is in agreement with Mr. Grahame as to the urgency of finding some means of allaying the growing sense of uneasiness among British and British-Indian traders in regard to the trade routes of Southern 1 ersia, puts forward a scheme, based on Messrs. Dixon’s suggestion, that gholams of the Indo- European Telegraph Department should be employed as road guards. He suggests the gradual establishment by the department of a staff of well mounted and armed gholams, whose primary object would, of course, be the care of the telegraph line, m whose presence on the road would, in his opinion, go far to prevent the present frequen robberies and to ensure the good conduct of the tribes. He further suggests that small parties of these gholams should accompany caravans travelling on the road at a cliaige to be paid by the merchants interested. , . q M -n-ii’ The director of the Telegraph Department, to whom 1 have submitted Mr. Bill s despatch for his observations, points out, however, the many objections to which t e scheme is open. He argues that, apart from the initial cost of such an undertaking, the maintenance of such a force would entail an annual extra expenditure of fioi 6 000/ to 7 000/ a-year, which it is unlikely would be covered by charges made on traders claiming protection for then- caravans, though Mr. Bill is sanguine that the scheme, when once in working order, could become self-supporting. , Mr. Barker adds that, as by its convention with the Persian Government the denartment is entitled to protection from the Persian Government, were the policing o the 1 soufhemfomls entrusted to its staff, it would to some extent abrogate its right to be protected^ated in another despatch&gt; J hope to discuss with Major Cox in die course of his approaching visit to Tehran, the question of the insecurity of the southern roads, and I shall then have the honour to address you again on th q s ' l ^ t &amp;o _ G.

Repeated to Bir.A.Nioolnon.Reference Paper. Political and Secret Department. Letter No. Rec. 19 Referred to t/lA I lA day of 19 The question discussed in Major Cox’s despatch is whether the services of the line patrols of the Indo-European Telegraph Department could be utilized to provide some measure of security for caravans travelling from and to Eushire, Bunder Abbas, and the interior. There are no telegraph lines from Bunder Abbas into the interior, so that the Depart ment could do nothing on this route. Therefore the question, as far as it applies to the Bushire route only, remains for consideration. Major Cox explains in para. | 3 of his despatch how it is that the employes in Persia i of the Indo-European Telegraph Department are treated 1 with so much good will by the inhabitants, and why in such a lawless country they are but seldom molested in the performance of their duties. He then goes on to ask how this desirable state of affairs could be main tained^, if the Departmental staff became actively identified with the protection of the road and the safe conduct of caravans. I have no doubt that if such duties were undertaken by the Department, there would be an end to the amicable relations that generally I exist between the country people and the staff maintain- ■ ing the telegraph lines. We have a good example of this on the Mekran coast where the assistance of the / Department \ 5609. I. 723. 1000.-4/1909.*4. 5th July, 1909. Department with regard to the prevention of the arms traffic has resulted in the Assistant Superintendent of Telegraphs having to travel with a much larger guard It is true that in this case it was mainly Afghan gun — runners 'who were likely to give trouble, but here the Department only collected information about their move ments, whereas on the bush ire route it appears to be desired that the line patrols should, if necessary, attack parties of marauders. I think that if the line staff of the Department becomes a kind of military police force along the telegraph lines it will be with disastrous consequences to the Department in its relations with the people of the country, and I should regret very much if any such arrangement v r as sanctioned,Out • v u ' ^ t 'l ;J09 n No. 1212 (Confidential), dated Bushire, the 23rd (received 31st) May 1909. From^ Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—S. H Butler, Esq., C.S.I., C.I E., Secretary to the Government of India in the roreign Department, Simla. I have the honour to forward, for the information of the Government of India a copy of a despatch No. dated 21st April 1909, which His Majesty s Consul at Shiraz has addressed to Sir George Barclay on the subject of the insecurity prevailing between Bushire and Ispahan and of oossible means of mitigating it. 1 2. In my telegrams of 16th instant from Fao I have already stated that I see no prospect of any improvement in the present depressins? commercial outlook unless we take steps in some form to police the trade routes from Bushire and Bunder Abbas to the interior. Mr. Bill now discusses a suggestion recently made by Messrs Dixon and company of Manchester, one of the chief British exporters to Southern Persia, that the services of the line patrols of the Telegraph Department should be made use of for the speedy communication, by portable telephone, ot news regarding molestation of caravans or the presence of robber gangs on the roads. 3. From a political point of view a scheme calculated to provide some measure of security for caravans through the instrumentality of the Telegraph Department and thus to avoid any ostensible intrenchment upon Persian indepen- C ^ advantages ; it remains to be seen how far the Depart ment concerned will see its way to co-operate in the matter. The great measure of good will and immunity from molestation which its employes have enjoyed in the past is doubtless due to the well-understood fact that they are servants of a Department which works for the convenience of the public and does not concern itself with trade or politics, and also because most of the peasant community are glad at some time or another of the help or friendly offices of the officials of the Department at the various centres. * How far this desirable state of things could be maintained if the personnel became actively identified with the protection of the road and the safe con duct of caravans is a problem which will no doubt occupy the careful considera tion of the Directorate concerned. In any case it is clear that to make any scheme in the direction suggested effective, the enrolment of a considerable body of ghulams would be necessary, for it would be obviously useless for the indivi duals on line patrol duty to telephone news to the nearest station, if there were no body of men ready there to take the necessary action on receipt of it. The strengthening of numbers, however, is a mere question of expense and adjustment, which could no doubt be satisfactorily arranged between the Depart ment and his Majesty’s Government ; the chief issue will doubtless be found to turn on the question of the extra risks likely to be involved by the identification of the personnel of the Telegraph Department with measures taken for maintaining the security of caravans; and until their views have been expressed, it is prema ture to discuss the scheme in greater detail.

With reference to the despatch No. 28, dated 10th March 1909, from His Majesty’s Consul-General, Ispahan, to your address, a copy of which was for warded to me, I have the honour to offer for your consideration, the following observations on this subject, with a suggestion towards a remedy. i *J8t_ appearance a volume of British the year 1907-08, a total value not only to direct depredation of the exactions prey every year think, be empha- has always been arising guards out who I must, in the first place, emphatically endorse the statement made by Mr. Grahame in the letter above quoted, in relation to the increasing feeling among British firms that the steps taken with regard to the robbery of British goods on the Bushire road have ceased to be adequate, and that it has conse- quently become desirable that His Majesty’s Government should consider what other steps it might be prepared to take in the interests of British trade in Persia. In this connection, I have the honour to forward for your information a copy of my reply to Mr. Grahame and to invite a reference to my despatch No. 88-M., dated 19th December 1908. It appears to me to be a matter of urgent importance that His Majesty’s Government should be fully aware that under present circumstances there appears to be no prospect whatever of any considerable or permanent improvement in the present conditions of transport from Bushire to Isfahan and that to all and British Indian trade which reached in of £ i ,200,000, will continue to be exposed but also to increasingly oppressive charges and misconduct of the headmen and road more severely on this commerce. A point which might, I sised with advantage, is that, although no doubt this road exposed in some degree to these evils, the situation in the past year or two has changed in a very important particular. Formerly, outbursts of lawlessness upon this road were the outcome either of local feuds, or of intrigue by some powerful personages designed to discredit some one or other of the local authorities, and such outbursts tended^ to subside on the removal of the exciting cause.' The present state of things is, in my diagnosis at least, widely different; it is simply due to the fact that the individual nomads, and to a less degree the villagers, have realised the almost complete incapacity of the Imperial authority to inflict any punishment whatever for either robberies or illegal exactions ; and it is obvious enough that this fact renders the solution of the problem far more difficult and wholly beyond the capacity of any authority which the Persian Government has it in its power to establish. In saying this, I have not overlooked the possibility that the success of thft Constitutional movement may induce some of the nomad chiefs to exert them selves to maintain order within their sphere; but a genuine amelioration of the conditions of transport by this means appears to me in the last degree improbable and in a matter of such vital importance it is imcumbent, I think, upon British Consular authorities not only to prepare His Majesty’s Government for the auure of such attempts, but to lay before them concrete proposals for a remedy, imagine that a few months, now, will be sufficient to demonstrate clearly the truth of the opinion which Mr. Grahame and I have already expressed, namely that the employment of some form of special force, organised and paid under foreign supervision, is absolutely the only alternative to the perpetration and aggravation of existing disorders. With this in view, it may perhaps be held that Messrs. Dixon’s suggestion, in itself impracticable, contains the germ of a more effective system The annual losses of the Indo-European Telegraph Department by wilful damage to the line have increased very considerably in the last few years, and this sum tITo8 n i! ing l a l am ''f-rd.t 0 some Krans 16,000 in Ears alone for the year 1W ,° be P r ?y ided , by the Persian Government. It is probable, therefore, that the latter would not look with disfavour upon a scheme which, while in no ., .y ,n er erln S w it its sovereign rights, would at the same time relieve it from this annually increasing expenditure and would also satisfy the clamorous demands of Persian merchants for the security of their merchandise.

I have not discussed any such proposals with any members of the Depart* ment, and it is possible that any system of the kind might be considered to lie too far beyond the proper sphere of their activities ; but if you should consider the idea worth following up, I should be quite prepared, in consultation with the Assistant Superintendent, Shiraz, (of course with the permission of the Director), to elaborate the details of such a scheme. It would probably necessitate the employment of one or two additional European officers, at any rate for the first few years, but I fancy it could be made to a large extent, if not entirely, self- supporting, and I believe that no other system would combine in the same degree the efficient protection of the road with a due respect for that internal independ ence of Persia, to the maintenance of which His Majesty’s Government is so firmly pledged. At all events l have felt it my duty to lay the alternatives clearly before you, in the hope that it may be found possible, either by the adop tion of some such scheme as that sketched above or by some other means, to give to a branch of British trade, which even under present conditions is far from unimportant, that minimum of ordinary security which alone is required to ensure its prosperous development.

Whitworth House, Princess Street, Manchester, Sir, • December 16, 1908. WE have the honour to address you in connection with the state of trade conditions in Persia. No doubt you are aware that owing to the political situation in Persia British trade is practically at a standstill. The chief factor which operates against trade is the insecurity of the roads, and, owing to the very frequent and serious robberies that have been taking place now for very many months, the Insurance Companies in England are in many cases declining to insure goods in Persia at all, or else insuring them at a rate that is prohibitive. This applies to British firms, but even when the goods have reached the trade centres the large native dealers are themselves unable to distribute them in the outlying districts for fear of robbery. Another very serious matter is that, owing to the exactions of the local Khans along the trade routes, who take heavy tolls from the muleteers as they pass along, rates of mule hire are rising to an exorbitant figure, and the muleteers themselves are deserting the roads, so that not only is transport excessively expensive, but it is becoming daily more scarce and difficult to obtain. Under these circumstances we feel that it is not out of place for us to respectfully suggest that road patrols, possibly Indian soldiers, accompany each large caravan of goods. The presence of Indian soldiers, lent to the Persian authorities for convoying large caravans of goods, would not have in the slightest degree a political character, as they would be there purely to safeguard British property or Persian property with the authority of the Shah. We earnestly beg to urge upon you the extreme necessity of some action of this kind, and beg to tender our thanks for the assistance we have had in the past and for the help and protection you will be able to extend at the present time.

(Confidential.) 26th August 1908. Foreign Office, I am directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to transmit to you herewith copy of a Despatch from His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Tehran, forwarding copy of a report addressed to the Government of India by His Majesty’s Consul-General at Bushire, reviewing the general political situation in the Persian Gulf. I am to state that Sir E. Grey would be glad to receive any obser vations which A iscount Morley may have to offer on this report in general, and in particular with regard to the following questions treated therein:— 10. The appointment of a British Vice-Consul at Lingah. It will be observed that this measure is strongly recommended by Mr. Marling, and Sir E. Grey is anxious to learn the view taken of the proposal by Lord Morley. 11. Major Cox inquires whether His Majesty’s Government have finally decided not to embark on any scheme for the policing of the Bushire-Shiraz and Bunder Abbas-Kerman trade routes, unless compelled to do so in order to save the lives of British subjects. 14. Major Cox submits that, in view of the present political situation in Persia, the existing arrangement whereby three of His Majesty’s ships are subsidised for service in the Persian Gulf, is no longer adequate as a support to himself in the defence of British interests in that region. Should Lord Morley concur in this view, it would become necessary to approach the proper Departments with a view to the revision of the arrangement at present in force. I am to add, with reference to Section 1 of Major Cox’s report, that the question of instructing Mr. Barclay, His Majesty’s newly-appointed Minister at Tehran, to proceed to his post by way of the Persian Gulf, has been considered, but that the difficulty and inconvenience attendant upon such a journey, as well as the delay which it w r ould necessarily entail, appear to outweigh any advantage to be gained from undertaking it, and that Mr. Barclay will, therefore, follow the ordinary route. Mr. Barclay might 'be able to visit the Gulf later on, or it might be advisable to adopt the alternative plan for which Mr. Marling appears to express a preference, and to instruct Major Cox to visit lehran at the earliest opportunity after Mr. Barclay’s arrival there. With regard to Section 9, I am to state that a copy of Mr. Marling’s despatch will be forwarded to His Majesty’s Ambassador at St. Peters burg, with instructions to use his discretion in taking an opportunity, if he should think it advisable, of approaching the Russian Government with regard to the withdrawal of the Russian Consulate at Bunder Abbas, after certain changes which are to be introduced into the personnel of the Russian establishments in Persia have taken place.

I have the honour to transmit herewith a copy of a despatch addressed by Major Cox to the Government of India giving a most interesting review of the general political situation in the Persian Gulf. Major Cox despatch so exactly represents my own opinions on such questions as lie within my purview that I need do no more than offer a few observations on one or two special points. I am more particularly in agreement in his advocacy of a personal discussion of Gulf questions between His Majesty’s Representative in Tehran and the Resident in the Gulf. So far as I can see, however, theie is but little prospect that the state of affairs in the capital will enable the former to leave his post for some time to come, and the only alternative would seem to be that the Resident in the Gulf should come to Tehran. I am not, indeed, prepared to say that the latter is not the preferable alternative ; the Legation is, indeed, kept so well informed of Gulf questions, both individual and general, by Major Cox’s admirable and exhaustive despatches that I doubt whether the short visit which a Minister could pay to Bushire would add very much to his effective knowledge. The Resident, on the other hand, is in the nature of things less well supplied with information on the political conditions at Tehran, or at all events obtains such information only after considerable delay’ and I am disposed to believe that a visit of the Resident to Tehran would on the whole produce better results than would a hasty tour in the Gulf by the Minister. I express this opinion with the greater confidence after reading Major Cox’s present despatch, in which there is scarcely a single sentence on purely Persian questions, and but few on , ma ^ 1 ers outside the jurisdiction of the Legation, which might not well have been written from Tehran instead of Bushire. As regards the inimical attitude towards us of some of the Russian Consular officers m the Gulf, on which Major Cox lays some stress, I must confess that 1 have not found it easy, in the absence of definite charges, to approach the Russian Minister on the question. I have, however on one or two occasions towards the end of last year mentioned to him that the Residency Agent at Lingah frequently found that Sadeed-es- feultaneh was using his influence as Russian Consular officer to our detriment. M. de Hartwig promised to send, and I make no question did send, instructions to the Sadeed to cease from activity of the kind complained of, but, speaking from memory, I gather from his language ^ G he had not much hope that his injunctions would produce much effect as Sadeed-es-Sultaneh was rather inclined to be independent 1 +r e neVe -' m ? ntl( ? ned M - Ovseenko’s attitude to M. de Hartwig, as - 1.1 om fh© occasional references he has made to that gentleman I have seTLe7 n,hffhh erth ff h&lt; iP/ 3 ve y h y h °P inion of his capacity and sen ices, and that m default of some definite charge I have felt that no good would result from doing so.

Major Cox to Government of India. (Confidential.) • Bushire, 6th June 1908. I have the honour to state that when Sir Cecil Spring-Rice, His Majesty s late Minister at Tehran, left his post on short leave in the autumn, I wrote to urge him to return, if possible, via the Persian Gulf. Subsequently, on learning that he would not resume his appointment in Persia, I ventured to express to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs the hope that it might be found practicable for Sir Cecil Spring-Rice’s successor to join his post by this route. It would, I feel confident, have been greatly in the public interest and to the advantage of the work between His Majesty’s Legation and this Residency had the new T Minister been able in my company to examine on the spot various aspects of the political and commercial outlook in the south, recently modified as it has been by the conclusion of the Anglo- Russian Convention, the activity of Germany and the effect of the national movement in Persia upon the economic condition of the country. In the hope that this meeting might take shape, I deferred addressing any special representations to the Government of India on the existing situation, but the travelling season has now passed, and I can no longer look forward to the privilege of discussing it in person with His Majesty’s Representative in the first instance. I am therefore constrained to lay the following independent observations before the Government of India :— 2. During the past eighteen months the situation has been very considerably affected, as far as our interests in the sphere of my appointment are concerned, by the three forces or events above quoted. I will touch upon their several effects in turn. 3 3. Our Reconciliation with Russia. —M. Passak, during the four years in which he represented Russian interests in Fars and the Gulf, appeared to me to work against us in every direction in which useful openings could be gained for so doing, and he apparently evinced the same disposition when transferred to the Russian Legation at Tehran. Of M. Andre Miller, who succeeded him, I have never had any cause for complaint. During the progress of the negotiations leading up to the Convention his attitude was correct and cordial, and since its conclusion our relations have increased in frankness, and I have every reason to hope and believe that the Russian Consulate-General at Bushire has ceased working to our prejudice. The same cannot yet be said of their Consulate at Bunder Abbas, which M. Ovseenko still fills. Deprived by the conclusion of the Con vention and probably by specific instructions from his Legation of any legitimate excuse for direct or overt opposition, he seems unable to divesthimself of habits and bias of long-standing, and continues to be a con siderable source of inconvenience to our Consulate and interests through the instrumentality of several Persian agents whom he employs on missions of espionage and intrigue. I may mention two who are chiefly prominent; firstly, the Sadood-es-Sultaneh, a drunken, but clever, little Persian with whom, when Foreign Office Agent at Bushire a few vears ago, the Residency refused to hold communication owing to his undesir able character and his obstructive attitude towards British interests; secondly, one Abdul Kassim, at one time a Munchi in the British Residency, but discharged as an undesirable character. AVhenever any strings exist which can be pulled to our prejudice, those persons and others like them are there to pull them, either by newspaper articles or by the encouragement of local Medjliss and Persian “ patriots ” in pro moting the new doctrine of “ Persia for the Persians and away with foreign influence.” Foreign influence, so far as they and the Gulf are concerned, is a synonym for British influence, and it is to the efforts of such persons and others of their kidney that the frequent difficulties which we now experience in effecting the protection of Bahreinis and subjects of the Trucial Coast are primarily due. 4. It is of interest to note here that whereas I have always prohibited the Pei sian employes of the Residency from joining the numerous mushroom Societies which the national movement has generated, and from identifying themselves with party politics, the representatives of other I owe is appear to place no such restrictions on their men, who, in the case of Bunder Abbas, seem to be actively encouraged thereto by -^b Ovseenko. But it is difficult to formulate definite charges m such matters, which could be_ fully substantiated if necessity arose, and I can only hope that the evil is a temporary one which, in view of our altered relations with Russia, will disappear with AL Ovseenko s departure on leave or elsewhere, or perhaps with the relinquishment altogether of the Russian Consulate at Bunder Abbas for which there is now no serious justification. With the above exception, Russian competition in the Gulf, whether commercial or political, may, I think, be regarded for the present as giving us little or no cause for anxiety. 5. The attitude of Germany—Until comparatively lately the German Lonsuiate at Bushire may be said to have been merely a post of obser- yation, but since the inception of the Hamburg-Amerika steamer service to the Gulf and the conclusion of the Anglo-Russian Convention, it can no longer be regarded m that light. In May 1907 Dr. Listemann, the incumbent of the German Consulate, was translated to his Legation for the summer, and since his return after six months under the influence of Herr von Richthofen, his bearing has altogether altered. Whereas formerly he used to mix freely with the rest of the Bushire community socially, he is nowadays seldom seen anywhere and keeps much to himself. Officially, though outwardly fi lendly, he shows himself m many little ways more prone to worry than y or f.’ an ^ at PA e ® ent the question of Gulf quarantine seems to be the direction in vrhich, apart from the Abu Musa case, his energies are c lefly directed. But though it will no doubt assume more of a political aspect as time goes on, the present Anglo-German question in the Gulf and Southern Persia is essentially commercial, and it is to that aspect of it that we now need chiefly to direct our energies. In this connection I may mention that Messrs. Wonckhaus’ agency at Lingah is being worked with great activity under Air. Brown, who has sometimes two, at other times three, German assistants with him, and they appear to be usin- u gah wheie, owing to the absence of serious competition from our owS tionals, they can practically do as they like, as a training-ground for their newly-arrived assistants and as the head-quarters of their Gulf operations, as distinct from their Bussorah-Bagdad branch. MoreoverMr. Brown, except for his own assistants, being the only European now in Lmgah, is identifying himself closely with local politics, and endeavouring to constitute himself a power in the place in a way which is likely to prove of considerable inconvenience to us. Q- I'l 16 'effect of the recent national and constitutional movement upon the administrative and economic conditions in Fars and on the Persian Gulf Littoral. Much might be written regarding the general results of the past eighteen months’ working of the movement; but Government must be generally familiar with its life history from the diaries and repoits of their officers in Southern Persia, and I will therefore curtail my remarks as far as practicable. I he national development is obviously one which any British Govern ment would be, primd facie, disposed, on principle, to watch with sympathetic interest, and I think it may be presumed that it has been watched by their local representatives in that spirit, in its earlier stages at all events. But even in the north, where the standard of civilisation is much more advanced and the people are more ripe for regeneration, His Majesty’s Legation must, I think, be beginning to despair at the continued prevalence of administrative chaos and the absence of all effective government. In the south I confess I have seen no result from the^ national movement and the attempt at constitutional government which has been otherwise than subversive of law and order, and generally paralyzing both to the administration and to commerce. Ihus the authority of local Governors has been altogether undermined by it. Provided as they now are with altogether inadequate pav, they are obliged to resort to all sorts of devices to obtain funds, and there has consequently been no cessation of corrupt methods of government, the only apparent difference being that the local official now lacks the practical personal authority to govern which he possessed before. Under the old regime, so long as he paid the revenue assessment regularly and complaints from his province were not too overwhelming, no questions were asked, and he was left to drive his own coach. Under the new conditions, including the existence of a free press and the right of public meeting, whenever a local Governor attempts to assert his authority in an effective and deterrent manner, some individual with a private grudge or an axe to grind, or one of the numerous Societies which have sprung up forthwith, dispatches a telegram to the Parliament or inspires a scurrilous article in the vernacular press, and a day or two later the Governor receives a telegram from Tehran asking for informa tion and report. Our present Persian Representative at Bushire, the Derya Begi, who on the whole has proved the most effective and conciliatory Governor we have had, has repeatedly of late expressed his exasperation at the humiliating position to which he has been reduced, and at the impossibility of exercising effective authority under existing conditions. The result is that the province of Fars and Persian Baluchistan (and Kermanshah for that matter) are in a state of lawlessness and adminis trative chaos which has not been equalled for generations, and under present conditions it is difficult to conceive how things can be righted or prevented from going from bad to worse except by foreign intervention in some form. Our commercial interests are most immediately affected in the matter of communications. Brigandage has been rife on the chief trade routes, i.e., Bushire-Shiraz and Bunder Abbas-Kerman for two years past. The forwarding of goods has been repeatedly stopped altogether and trade with the interior brought to a standstill. Trade has, in fact, been paralyzed, and cases of bankruptcy among the native merchants in trading relations with British firms have been of almost daily occurrence. As regards the Shiraz route some little hope has, indeed, been inspired by the appointment of the Zil-es-Suftan, but conditions on the Iverman route are still as bad as they can be.7. There is one other direction in which the changed conditions of government in Tehran have affected our interests adversely, namely, in their bearing upon the administration of the customs. When the Tariff of 1903 and the Belgian Administration were first inaugurated the Government of India will remember that for a long time afterwards a good deal of difficulty was experienced by political officers owing to the aggressive attitude of some of the inexperienced Belgians with whom they had to deal. As time progressed, however, a working modus vivendi was gradually arrived at, by concessions made on both sides, and, within the sphere of my post at all events, relations with the Belgian regime had much improved at the epoch at which the intro duction of Parliamentary government took place. From the first, however, the attitude of the popular party was most hostile to M. Naus and his Belgian staff, and the position of the latter has since been a difficult and precarious one in consequence. On the one hand, while under M. Naus’ regime the local Directors were allowed to engage Bagdadis, Chaldeans, and Armenians as clerks or subordinates, and found that they were better served by these than by Persians, they are now under orders to entertain Persians wherever possible. Persians are being employed also in the higher grades, such as the Directorship of Lingah. The type of Persian which the Depart ment gets, especially those sent from the north, is of the partially or somethnes highly educated newspaper-reading class, which has been most influenced by the nationalist propaganda preached therein and most intrinsically hostile to the presence of foreigners in any Department of the Persian Government. These men naturally work against their Belgian superiors, and the position of the latter has become so unpalatable that resignations and departures on leave pending retirement have been rife during the past year, and include the men who have been most conciliatory in their relations with us. The truth is that under the old regime if they wanted a reasonably quiet time they had to curry favour with the Russians or ourselves ; now they have to conciliate the Medjliss and vernacular papers, which lose no opportunity of making thino-s uncomfortable for them. ° On the other hand, owing to the great financial straits to which the Central Government is reduced, the Customs Directors are constantly being pressed to submit more copious funds to the capital, and in order to increase their receipts and meet such demands, they have had recourse to the strict application of many items of the Reglement which they have before allowed to become a dead letter or had interpreted liberally after earning by experience that they were unsuited to the peculiar conditions of commerce m the harbourless Gulf ports. We now seem to be gradually drifting back to the unpleasant relations of three years ao- 0 and at present the British trader has not only to contend with every conceivable difficulty and risk which the insecurity of the trade routes and the uncontrolled licence of tufangchis can provide, but is being daily harassed at the ports by some harsh decision or the new or revived interpretation of some catchpenny clause in the Reglement. 8. Having in the foregoing paragraphs placed before Government in . lg + l 1 t wlll fh it presents itself to me the general situation existing within the sphere of my post, I now have the honour with much respect to suggest means which, short of armed intervention for the protection of our interests, seem likely in my judgment to strengthen our hands. 1 will record them m the same order as the subjects above indicated with which they are connected. 9. The possible withdrawal of the Russian Consulate, Bunder Abbas.— remember right His Majesty’s Legation, before the conclusion of the Tpo 8 p7n 1 n US f a \r A ^ eemei i lt ’’ dl 5 1 draw tlie attention of the Russian -Legaaon to M. Ovseenko s demeanour towards our Consulate and mteiests, and Sir Cecil Spring-Rice expressed to me incidentally theor hope that the Czar s Government could hardly retain him at Bunder Ahbas after the conclusion of the negotiations. Nevertheless, he still retains his post. I am aware, however, that it would be difficult to formulate specific charges against him which could, if necessary, be substantiated by direct proof, but perhaps His Majesty’s Government would consider the feasibility of sounding the Russian Ambassador as to whether his Government intend to maintain their present arrangements at Bunder Abbas, wffiere their interests are now exiguous. 10. Appointment of a British T ice-Consul at Ling ah. —Owing in a great measure to the supineness and excessive caution of our ow r n merchants it will be seen that Messrs. Wonckhaus, through their energetic employe, Mr. Brown, have acquired a very firm footing in Lingah. Moreover, they are already, I believe, doing a good deal of business wdth the Trucial Coast, through their friend, Haji Hassan-bin-Ali Samaiyeh; the latter being agent for the Bombay Persian Steam Navigation Company, whose steamers ply there with more or less regularity. I have done my best to induce Messrs. Gray Paul to improve their representation at Lingah, wffiere they have hitherto entrusted their interests to a useless native agent, and they now assure me that they will endeavour to make some better arrangement. I do not, however, expect much from them, and in my view it is important that Government should appoint a British officer as Vice-Consul at that port who would lay himself out both to work up the trade of the port and at the same time to counteract the personal influence of Messrs. Wonckhaus’ representative wdio now has the field to himself. Our present Residency Agent, Khan Saheb Agha Bedr, who is an excellent specimen of his class and the best native agent we have had, looks after British subjects and protected persons with much zeal and energy, but he cannot be of much service in regard to trade questions. He only receives a salary of 50 rupees per mensem, and I recommend that he be maintained wffiere he is as native assistant to the Consular officer, who could employ him most usefully to work up influence in the Lar and Bastak districts, which are supplied from Lingah, and to wffiich the Germans will certainly turn their attention if they have not already. The appointment of a British officer might be considered tentative for two or three years. Regarding the mother o’ pearl trade from Lingah, wffiich has proved the making of the German firm, I am addressing Government separately. 11. The Policing of the Trade Routes.—Has it been finally decided by His Majesty’s Government that, except the step be forced on them, in order to save the lives of Englishmen in Persia, they wdll not embark on anv scheme for the policing of the Bushire-Shiraz and Bunder Abbas- Kerman routes, either that advocated by Mr. Grahame or any modification of it ? 12. Revision of Customs Tariff and “Reglement” of 1903.—The fundamental condition on wffiich this flanff was accepted was that all other transit dues and imposts should be abolished, but it is now upwards of four vears since the Tariff was introduced, and yet rahdari m one form or another, and other illegal imposts are persistently levied. It is not only a fact that the Central Government has no practical power to stop them but they still include the income from various illegal taxes m the official schedule of revenue which they call upon local Governors to COll The continual representations of this Residency and His Majesty’s Legation have no result, a levy is merely taken off to-day and impose Then again, the heavy duty imposed on certain classes of goods, such as tea, coffee, has created a colossal system of organized smuggling throughout the Persian littoral, wdth which the Persian Government areentirely unable to cope, and which nothing but a reversion to a reason able all-round ad valorem tariff or an organized system of coastguard will stop. 1 his smuggling industry is obviously extremely damaging to the interests of legitimate trade. An honest trader at the ports naturally cannot do business when the wares tn which he deals can be bought for 10 or 15 per cent, less a few miles outside the port if not actually in it. I respectfully ask if it is necessary that we continue indefinitely to allow our traders to be increasingly oppressed at the ports by the harsh application of an inflated tariff only accepted on specific terms, which the Persian Government make no attempt to fulfil, and could not if they would. Novv that wo have settled our differences with Russia, would it not be possible to get them to agree to its abrogation in favour of an all- round 71 or b per cent, ad valorem duty, a change which would render smuggling a useless risk and increase the revenue at the same time ? 7 • 13 /&lt; examination of the Arrangement under which His Majesty s ships Sphinx, Lapwing,” and “Redbreast” are subsidised for Service in the l ersian Gulf. We have now had nearly four years’ experience of the working of this arrangement, and while cordially appreciating the complete co-operation and support which I have received from His Excellency Sir George Warrender and his predecessor Sir Edmund Poe, , ., r . . lse ^hat the Naval Commander-in-Chief cannot perform impossi bilities, and am of opinion that if present conditions are to continue, as it seems likely that they will, the requirements of the Gulf of Oman, the Persian Gulf proper, and the Shatt-el-Arab cannot be adequately met by three vessels now subsidised. Even at normal times, taking into account en minimum periods of absence for necessary service purposes such as recommissioning, redocking and fitting and occasional and very necessary changes of air and scene for the officers and crews 1 r + n c eai ^ ve E hard for three ships to do the work required 0 them without undue strain ; and if the concentration of ships on the Mekran coast in the winter months in connection with the arms traffic is to continue, the needs of the northern part of the Gulf will suffer greatly At the present time, moreover, owing to tfm absence of any settled or effective Government in Tehran His majesty s Legation is perforce not in a position in connection with incidents arising m the Gulf to obtain satisfaction in Tehran by ordinary i’LTiumWn 118 !’ t ’ nd a i Hl i S f a J est y’ s Government, for reasons which 1 well understand have decided to retrain for the present from taking any drastic steps for asserting our position, it follows that, as in the depend chie^ ^or^^P 6 ' 1 ° f a ]iaIlreini at Lin S ah . 1 shall have to , - v '' maintaining our interests and good name in these Sle^It il ‘ ^ b6 !° Cally With the “ ordinarily tion 6 B would a be n a ^ 1 rTW 0 h ° Pe ’ recei ving favourable Considera tion. it would be a great advantage to connect up Lingah at the same easy'reaeh o' Sh ^ ^ being whh“n sy reach of Lmgah It would seem important also that His Maiestv’s subsidized ships should be fitted with wireless as soon as possible.' ^ r Illl P rove d Representation on the Trucial GW*.—-The experience these\actwafd 0 Sheikh W' 8 me , doilbt Aether it is safe to leave mese backward bheikhs longer m the charge of a native ao-ent X shod shoitly address Government a separate communication on the subject.I have, &amp;c.

His Majesty’s Government understand that the Russian Government intend shortly to transfer the present Russian Minister at Tehran to another post, and, if you should think it advisable, an opportunity might be taken after M. D. Haft wig has left Persia of calling the attention of M. Isvolsky to the point raised by Major Cox. I leave the time and manner of taking this step entirely to your Excellency’s discretion.

I have bad the bonour to receive your Despatch No. 266, Con fidential, of the 26th ultimo, relative tp the abolition of the Russian Consulate at Bunder Abbas. I am of opinion that M. Isvolsky would not be indisposed to effect some considerable changes among the various Russian officials employed at Tehran and elsewhere in Persia, but he would expect that some corresponding measures would be taken by His Majesty’s Government in regard to British officials. It is no doubt true that we have perfectly sound reasons for desiring the transfer of certain Russian officials, whose activity at their present posts is inconvenient and unfortunate ; but the Russian Government imagine that to insure the smooth working of the Convention it would be most desirable that some British officials should also be moved to other spheres. The question is one which will have to be discussed sooner or later, and I should, of course, be perfectly ready to speak with M. Isvolsky on the subject, but I am sure that it would be to no purpose to select one individual Russian employe for special and solitary treatment. Moreover, I doubt whether it would be wise to ask for the abolition of the Russian Consulate at Bunder Abbas. Such a request might lead to proposals from the other side that we shoidd abolish a post or two in the Russian sphere ; and with this w r e might be disinclined to agree. I would suggest limiting our proposals to a change of individuals. As M. Isvolsky is visiting London next month, the question as to a reorganisation of the respective staffs might perhaps be opened up with him on that occasion, and the detailed discussions continued here when he returns. I would wish to take this opportunity of mentioning that I doubt if M. de Hartwig will be transferred as soon as was anticipated. It is considered but just that another post should be found for him, and at present there is no suitable one vacant. The Right Hon. Sir E. Grey, Bart., M.P., &amp;c., &amp;c. I have, Ac., A.

Letter from Board of Trade, dated 25th September 1908 British commercial interests in the Persian Gulf. regardingAnnex 1. Board of Trade to Foreign Office. Sir, No. 33,749. Board of Trade, (Commercial Department), 7, Whitehall Gardens, London, S.W., 25th September 1908. 1 am directed by the Board of Trade to acknowledge the receipt of youi letter of^ the 13th August (No. 26,812) enclosing print of a despatch from His Majesty’s Representative at Tehran with accom- panymg report to the Government of India by the British Resident in the Persian Gulf dealing with various matters affecting British com mercial interests in that region. M ith reference thereto, I am to say that the Board are disposed to concur in Major Cox’s suggestion as to the desirability of establishing a Vice-Consulate at Lingah, especially in view of German commercial activity in that vicinity. It will be seen from the accompanying table that as a consequence of the transference of a large portion of the pearl and shell trade to the neighbourhood of Bahrein the trade of the port has considerably declined during the last 10 years, and with it the Anglo-Indian share. It is still considerable, however, and the entrances and clearances of shipping (mostly British) tend to increase. The Board assume that any appointment which may be decided upon will be made in concert with the Indian Government. I am also to suggest, for the consideration of Sir E. Grey, whether a consular officer at Debai, to which much of the trade formerly done at Lingah has been transferred, and also whether the Political Resident at Bahrein, might be assisted by a paid vice-consul. With regard to Major Cox’s observations respecting the Persian Treaty Tariff I am to refer to the fact that this tariff is, in the main, that which was appended to the Russo-Persian Treaty, this having been adopted as the basis of the tariff side of the negotiations leading up to the existing Anglo-Persian Treaty. In view, therefore, of the present understanding with Russia regarding Persia, the Board think that His Majesty’s Government would probably hesitate to make advances to Persia in the direction of embarking upon a new negotiation, however desirable it may be to secure some alteration of the tariff provisions, without first coming to an agreement with Russia upon the matter. The question whether circumstances are ripe for such action is one for the consideration of Sir E. Grey. , I have, &amp;c., The Under Secretary of State, Arthur Wilson Fox. Foreign Office.Government of India on the suggestions made by His Majesty’s Consul- General at Bushire in his letter of the 6th June 1908, regarding the general political situation in the Persian Gulf. Viscount Morley concurs generally in the views expressed by the Government of India. As regards the various points raised in the correspondence, he desires to make the following observations :— (1.) Visit of Major Cox to Tehran .—Lord Morley considers that a meeting between Sir G. Barclay and Major Cox would be advantageous, and, subject to Sir E. Grey’s approval, he is prepared to instruct the Government of India to authorise Major Cox, as soon as a suitable opportunity occurs for leaving the Gulf, to proceed to Tehran. (2.) British and Russian Consular Establishments .—-The views of the Government of India on this subject are in substantial agreement with those expressed by His Majesty’s Ambassador at St. Petersburgh in his despatch of the 7th September last, No. 400. Pending the consideration, in connection with the despatch promised by the Govern ment of India, of the question of our own establishments, the most that can be done is presumably to propose to the Russian Government a change of individuals, as suggested by Sir A. Nicolson, should a favourable occasion present itself. (3.) The immediate appointment of a British Vice-Consul at Lingah .—On a full consideration of the reasons given by Mr. Marling in his despatch of the 14th July last, No. 167, the Secretary of State in Council would be prepared, if Sir E. Grey agrees, that a case for immediate action has been made out, to accept a moiety of the cost of the appointment of a Vice-Consulate at Lingah as a charge upon Indian revenues, the other half being defrayed by the Imperial Exchequer. If a suitable officer of the Levant Consular Service were available for the post the cost would be less than if an officer of the Indian Political Department were appointed. It is observed that the Board of Trade are in favour of the creation of the appointment. (4.) Policing the trade routes .—The proposals formulated by the Government of India in their Despatch No. 33, dated the 15th March 1906, w r ere communicated to the Foreign Office with my letter of the 1st May 1906. But the consideration of the subject was postponed owing to the decision of the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury that an examination of the whole question of the scale of British expenditure in Persia was necessary before sanction could be given to the payment from British revenues of half the cost of any measures other than those that had actually been carried into effect. Sir E. Gorst’s letter of the 15th February 1907, in which the Secretary of State in Council was informed of this decision, stated that, in Sir E. Grey’s opinion, while certain of the proposals that had been made might form the subject of further consideration, “ the question of policing the southern trade routes “ and of affording proper protection to British trade interests in that part “ of Persia is one of immediate importance.” Lord Morley concurs entirely in the view of the Government of India that, in the present condition of Persia, it is undesirable to take any action in the matter. (5.) Customs Administration.—On this point, also, Lord Morley agrees with the Government of India that no action should be taken pending developments of the financial position in Persia, when the matter will have to be considered m connection with the international question, referred to by the Board of Trade. (6.) Inadequacy of the present Naval Arrangements in the Gulf— Lord Morley is fully aware of the strain imposed upon His Majesty’s ships by the necessity for dealing with the arms traffic on the Mekran coast. He agrees with the Government of India that the question mayIje postponed until the results of the Brussels Conference, and of the negotiations respecting the importation of arms'into Muskat, have been ascertained. (7.) Extension of Cable Communication and introduction of Wireless 1 clccji aphy. This subject will be dealt with in a separate communication* (&lt;S.) frucial Coast. Lord Morley will await the recommendations of the Government of India on the further report expected from Major Cox. In conclusion, I am to say that Lord Morley concurs entirely in the view indicated in the last sentence of the Viceroy’s telegram, that His Majesty’s Government, in dealing with questions of Persian policy, should bear in mind the effect likely to be produced by any action they may take, not only in Afghanistan, but in all countries subject to a Muhammadan government.

E Further representations from Major Cox are still awaited with regard to arrangements on trucial coast. We desire to make it clear, in recording our opinions, that they are formed with reference to the present state of finances and politics of Persia, and, in view of the fact that the bringing about of substantial reforms appears to be hopeless. As developments in Persia are being closely watched by the Afghans, it is also important that, for the present, no action should be taken by which the status quo would be materially altered in Persia. I am directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 11th ultimo, respecting the suggestions made by His Majesty’s Consul-General at Bushire in his Despatch of 6th June 1908, regarding the general political situation in the Persian Gulf. 1. J isit of Major Cox to Tehran. —Sir E. Grey concurs in the proposal that Major Cox should be authorised, as soon as a suitable opportunity occurs for leaving the Gulf, to proceed to Tehran. 2. British and Russian Consular Establishments. —Sir E. Grey concurs in the view that consideration of this subject in general should be deferred as proposed ; he is, however, not disposed to take any action in regard to the transfer of M. Ovseenko for the present. 3. The immediate appointment of a British Vice-Consul at Lingah .— Sir E. Grey concurs that an such appointment is desirable, and he is of the Treasury. 4. Policing the trade routes. —Sir E. Grey concurs in the views of Lord Morley. 5. Customs Administration. —Sir E. Grey agrees that no action is at present called for. 6 6. Inadequacy of the present naval arrangements in the Gulf. —Sir E. Grey considers that it would be expedient to await, as proposed, the results of the Brussels Conference on the Arms Traffic and of the negotiations with France in regard to Muscat. Enclosure No. 6. Foreign Office to India Office. No. 39,454. Foreign Office, 1st December 1908. Sir, about to have the matter brought before the Lords Commissioners I am, &amp;c., The Under Secretary of State for India. W. Langley.Enclosure x No. 7. India Office to Foreign Office. India Office, gi r 8th- January 1909. With reference to your letter No. 39,454, dated the 1st December 1908, as to the situation in the Persian Gulf, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to enclose copy of a despatch which he has addressed to the Government of India on the subject. In connection with what is said in your letter under the heading of “ British and Russian Consular Establishments,” Viscount Morley would invite the attention of Secretary Sir E. Grey to the statements contained in recent Political Diaries of the Bushire Residency, that M. Ovseenko, the Russian Consul, left Bunder Abbas on leave on the 16th October last, and that M. Mathiew, his Assistant, was also proposing to go on leave. The opportunity might be taken, if circumstances are favourable, for suggesting to the Russian Government the appointment of some other officer to Bunder Abbas. I have, &amp;c., The Under Secretary of State, A. Godley. Foreign Office. Enclosure No. 8. India Office to Foreign Office. India Office, Sir, 28th October 1908. With reference to my letter of the 5th August, I am directed by Viscount Morley to transmit herewith, to be laid before the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, copy of correspondence with the Admiralty respecting the proposal of the Commanding Officer of His Majesty’s ship Sphinx that the vessels employed in the Persian Gulf should be fitted with wireless telegraphy. As regards the question of land stations for wireless telegraphy on the coast of the Persian Gulf, which is raised in the Viceroy’s telegram of the 21st September, a further communication will be made to you on receipt of a reply from the Government of India to Lord Morley’s despatch of the 10th July last, a copy of which was inclosed with my letter of the 5th August. I am &amp;c., The Under Secretary of State, A. Godley. Foreign Office. Enclosure No. 9. India Office to Admiralty. India Office, Sir, 28th October 1908. With reference to your Secret letter dated the 3rd August 1908, in which the views of the Secretary of State for India were solicited on a proposal that the vessels employed in the Persian Gulf should be fitted with wireless telegraphy, I am directed by Viscount Morley to transmit herewith, to be laid before the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, copy of telegraphic correspondence with the Government of India on the subject.Lord Morley agrees with, the Government of India that the installation of wireless telegraphy on the three subsidized vessels would be of great advantage both for the suppression of the arms traffic and for general police work in the Gulf. But he would prefer that this proposal should be considered separately, without reference to the further question raised by the Government of India of the establishment of land stations for wireless telegraphy on the Persian Gulf littoral, as to which it is proposed to take no action pending the receipt of a reply from the Government of India to Lord Morley’s despatch of the 10th July 1908, a copy of which is inclosed herewith. As regards the financial effect of the proposal, it appears to Lord Morley that the cost of the installation on the three vessels, which is estimated at 1,533L initial, and 196L per annum recurring, should be regarded as incidental to their proper equipment according to modern standards, and should be defrayed from naval funds. I am, &amp;c., The Secretary, Admiralty. A- Godley.

A further cause of insecurity relating to this is referred to in a note (ff 335-336) by the 2nd Assistant Resident, Bushire, J S Crosthwaite, who describes how tribesmen had invested their money in rifles and could only earn their living by robbing the caravans of commercial travellers.Correspondence discusses how this culminated in an attack upon J H Bill, Acting British Consul, Shiraz, in which two horsemen or '
                           sowars' were killed, as he travelled along a caravan route. Correspondence discusses measures to be taken as a result of this attack, including a claim for compensation from the Persian Government, a punitive expedition against the Kashgais tribe and the role of Soulet et-Dowle, Governor General, Fars. Measures discussed include using the guards (
                           gholam) of the Indo-European Telegraph Department paid for by a surcharge on customs duty levied by the British at Bushire; implications for relations with the Persian Government and the Russian Government are also discussed.Included in the volume is a 'Memorandum respecting the Disorders on the Trade Routes of Southern Persia' by H G Trick, Vice-Consul for Fars.The principal correspondents in the volume include Sir Edward Grey, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs; Viscount Morley of Blackburn, Secretary of State for India; Percy Zachariah Cox, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; and Sir George Head Barclay, Minister at Tehran.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Persian Governor-General of Fars Province</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Foreign Secretary</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Boir Ahmadi (Tribe)</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Shiraz</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Kazerun</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Bushire</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Diplomacy</topic></subject><subject><topic>Highway robbery</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x000038#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
