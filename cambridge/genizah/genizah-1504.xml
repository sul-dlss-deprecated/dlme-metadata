                  <summary>Letter from David Maimonides to his brother Moses in 1170 CE. David had
                     intended to travel to the Sudanese port of ʿAyḏāb by caravan to trade with
                     merchants there, but missed the caravan and decided to travel to ʿAyḏāb in a
                     small group (an extremely dangerous undertaking). Upon arrival in ʿAyḏāb, David
                     and his companions found out that the caravan they had intended to join had
                     been robbed and many people had died. He felt very fortunate indeed to have not
                     been among them. He writes to Moses to explain his fortune, but also to say
                     that because his journey had taken longer than expected, the traders had left
                     ʿAyḏāb and, against the express wishes of Moses, David has decided to continue
                     on to India to trade there. He sends greetings to many family members, writing
                     ‘God will replace your losses and bring me back to you’. Unfortunately David
                     died on this sea voyage after his ship sank, and this is the last letter to his
                     family.</summary>

            <p> To my beloved brother R. Mos[es, son of R.] Maimon – the memory of the righteous be
               blessed!</p>
            <p>David, your brother who is longing for you – may God unite me with you under the most
               happy circumstances in his grace.</p>
            <p>I am writing this letter from ‘Aydhab. I am well, but my mind is very much troubled,
               so that I walk around in the bazaar and do not know – by our religion – where I
               [am...], nor how it is that I did not imagine how much you must worry [about m]e.</p>
            <p>This is my story: I reached Qus and after Passover I booked for ‘Aydhab in a caravan.
               [...]</p>
            <p>So we travelled alone out of fear of him. No one has ever dared to embark on such a
               disastrous undertaking. I did it only because of my complete ignorance. But God
               [saved] us after many frightful encounters, to describe which would lead me too far
               afield. When we were in the desert, we regretted what we had done, but the matter had
               gone out of our hands. Yet God had willed that we should be saved. We arrived in
               ‘Aydhab safely with our entire baggage. We were unloading our things at the city
               gate, when the caravans arrived. Their passengers had been robbed and wounded and
               some had died of thirst. Among them was Ibn al-Rashidi, but he was unharmed. [...] We
               preceded him only slightly and there was only a small distance between us and those
               who were robbed. We were saved only because we had taken upon ourselves those
               frightful experiences. All day long I imagine how you must feel when you hear about
               ‘Ata’ Allah Ibn al-Rashidi, how he was robbed, and you believe that I was in his
               company. Then God comes between me and my reason.</p>
            <p>To cut a long story short: I arrived in ‘Aydhab and found that no imports had come
               here [...] at all. I found nothing to buy except indigo. So I thought about what I
               had endured in the [des]ert [...]; then it appeared a simple matter for me to embark
               on a sea voyage. I took Mansur as my travel companion, but not Ma‘ani... for all my
               troubles came [only from him; you know] the man and how he behaves (2 Kings 9:11).
               Sometime, if God wills it, I shall tell you [all that happened between us] on our way
               from Fustat to ‘Aydhab.</p>
            <p>My company in the Mala[bar] sea will be [...], Salim, the son of the broker and his
               brother's son, Makarim al-Hariri and his b[rother], and the brother of Sitt Ghazal.
               But Ma`ani embarked, together with Ibn al-Kuwayyis on another ship, and Bu 'l-`Ala
               remains in Dahlak, since the ship in which he travelled foundered, but he was saved
               and absolutely nothing of his baggage was lost. Ibn `Atiyya, however, was in another
               boat, together with Ibn al-Maqdisi. Their boat foundered and only their din[ars]
               remained with them.</p>
            <p>Now, despite all of this, do not [worry]. He who saved me from the desert with its
               [...] will save me while on sea. [...] And, please, calm the heart of the little one
               and her sister; do not frighten them and let them not despair, for crying to God for
               what has passed is a vain prayer (M. Berakhot 9:3). [...] I am doing all of this out
               of my continuous efforts for your material well-being, although you have never
               imposed on me anything of the kind. So be steadfast; God will replace your losses and
               bring me back to you. Anyhow, what has passed is past, and I am sure this letter will
               reach you at a time when I, God willing, shall have already made most of the way. But
               the counsel of God alone will stand (Proverbs 19:21). Our departure will probably be
               around the middle of Ramadan.</p>
            <p>I shall trav[el with ... Tell this] to his uncle, and also that he is fine. [Best
               regards to you, to] Bu `Ali and his brother, to the elder Bu Mansur and his brothers,
               to my sisters and the boys, to all our friends, to the freedman, and Mahasin.</p>
            <p>Written on the 22nd of Iyyar, while the express caravan is on the point of
               leaving.</p>
