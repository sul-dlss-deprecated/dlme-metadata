But purely.tem porar y disposal is another matter and it should not be difficult to reach ad hoc agreement as to the temporary use to which individual items of property and equipment may be used, provided each Government is consulted and usual inventories kept and receipts taken against items handed over, and provided also it is understood that ultimate disposal of property or of funds accruing is not prejudiced thereby. Valuation on basis of cost price less depreciation (plus cost of transport to Persia where appropriate) should if possible be agreed at time of hand over. 3. The Humber car may thus in our view be handed over to the Indian Ambassador in accordance with foregoing procedure and provided Pakistan Government are consulted and give their agreement, and similar procedure should apply to division of equipment at Kerman and Bandar Abbas to which you refer. (Y/e presume cost of car was borne in 'moieties” but are checking). 4. We should be careful not to stress too much our contribution to the cost of this equipment at this stage since presumably Government of India or Government of Pakistan could equally make counter claim on His Majesty^ property in Persia^ at the Embassy and at United Kingdom - Consular posts to cost of which they may also be said to have contributed under former 'moiety” arrangements.Code R L I'QKtm cewmzr ia FRO &gt; T, iLHAlT TC rCitv Sir J* Le Rouget«l u, 1206 T^tETfov ember, 1947.

This letter serves to confirm that we still have an order registered for a Humber Super Snipe Saloon for delivery to the Political Resident in the Persian G-ulf, and it is anticipated that we shall be in a position to allocate a car to this order during this^month. Yours faithfully. Overseas DepartmentWill you please refer to your express letter N o. Ext. 7089/46 T dated the 2 4th Novembe r, 1946, to Foreign, with a copy to us, about a car for the Political Resident ? 2. We at once took the matter up with Disposals Mission, Cairo. In reply to a telegram of ours of November 8th, Mitchell telegraphed us on November 12th that Disposals Office, Baghdad, would tell us when we were to send a representative to view the cars. We then telegraphed to Disposals, Baghdad, asking them to wire us when the represen tative should go. There the matter rested till the 10th of this month when, in answer to an urgent reminder to Disposals, Baghdad, we got a curt telegram to the effect that there were no Buicks available. We have since received from them a list of vehicles available, consisting almost exclusively of heavy duty vehicles, none of which are of any interest to us; no mention is made of the Buicks. 3. In the circumstances, there appears no alternative but to pursue the Humber Super-Snipe again, although Colonel Hay does not consider it up to the standard required for a Residency car especially as the Petroleum Concessions, Limited, representative here, to quote one instance, is pro vided by his Company with a Pullman Limousine Humber. From Rootes letter to you No. JGC/W of the 4th November. 1946. it appears that this order Is still registered with them. I should be grateful if you could have this confirmed and could also endeavour to get a firm delivery date from them. . 4. We cannot help feeling somewhat aggrieved that the Buicks should have apparently been sold in this way above our heads. If you agree, perhaps you would consider representing the facts to the Ministry of Supply and sug gesting that they should inquire into their fate. 5. I am sending a copy of this letter to Duke. A.

In his note flagged Y at Collection 30A97, Mr* Imriby gives a note of the vaid-ous types of expenditure in the Gulf. The onO^ other relevant paper appears to be Mr. Pee^s letter to Sir 0.

It is, therefore, a little difficult to approach the Foreign Office on the question of bringing items of special war expenditure into line with the arrangement for sanctioning items of diplomatic and Consular expenditure up to £1,000; especially as we do not usually consult them on such items ,but write to the Treasury direct. In view of Mr. Grist*s note below, however, a tentative draft is attached. F. /OJ03&gt;DRAFT LETTER The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office, S.W.l.

'dach^GovexTirnent mans anu initially pays for certain consulates and each is unuer an obligation to obtain the consent of the other to “any ffesh expenditure of more than &lt;£100 a year on any consulate in its jurisdiction. This is of course all very fine and large in normal times, but it seems to me in present circumstances that we might very well consider raising •this limit to something a lit ;le more reasonable. I have, for instance, just had put before me a long reference from a consul at one of the Foreign Office consulates regarding an increase in the cost-of-living allowance for the subordinate staff of the consulate. An elaborate case has been «iade out which has been suprjorted by Tehran to the Foreign Office who have put it to the Treasury and to us for concurrence. /e should normally refer it to the Government of India and if they agreed to bear their half-share we should report their concurrence to the Foreign Office, who (if the Treasury also agreed) would then notify the consul that his proposals bud been approved. The total amount involved in all this elaborate correspondence is some £230 a year which is to be divided equally between the two Goverrments. It does seem to me that in present circumstances it is absurd to insist on this elaborate procedure being gone through over matters of such trifling importance. What with delays in the post and congestion on the wires I think a J .H •£. ,.oods, j3Cj[., H.v.O., Treasury. reasonable/ . —Unfortunately the Governrnent of Inaia request that this item should be classed as ' special war expenditure' not as Diplomatic and Consular expenditure where it would ccme under the JS1000 arrangement. In 1 942 when the Government of Inuia wished to treat Wartime Expenditure in Persia and the Persian Gulf as divisible in moieties pending a decision as to its allocation between Imperial and Indian Revenues, ^he Financial Secretary was of^ the opinion r ‘%o take up this proposal H.il.G. might prejudice the settlement of the larger question of India* s war expenditure as a whole, and the idea was therefore dropped. (Ext. 386 / 42 ). Perhaps it should also be noted tliat on items classed as 'special wartime expenditure' we deal with the Treasury direct and not through the Foreign Office since ; pending the final decision^no part of the expenditure is cliarged to the Foreign Office vote.Please see note at Ext.2571/44 regarding the supply of a truck to the Political. Officer on the Trucial Coast, The Government of India have now written to say that they have sanctioned the sum of Rs.2400 for the maintenance of this truck and proposing that the amount should be classed as special war expenditure. As the expenditure on the purchase was so classified, it seems reasonable that the cost of its maintenance should be also.

' Dear Peel, ( % - We read with great interest and amusement the Foreign Office Circular No.X*8066/799/504 of the 9th December, 1943 on the subject, of the amalgamation of the Foreign Office and Diplomatic Service with the Consular Service. As I think you know, I have recently been on tour in Persia, and there are one or two matters which strike one forcibly regarding the v position of Consuls in that country. Our excuse for writing to you on this subject is that at the present moment the majority of the Consular appointments in Persia, to be exact X think the number is 8 out of 12 or 13, are found from the Indian Service, and we have for generations been interested in the functions and opportunities of Consular posts in Persia. xO S84&amp;Q -6 lO X)~ &lt; 2. X made the personal suggestion to Bullard that the member of his staff chosen for paying periodical visits to Consulates might perhaps be the Additional Counsellor found from the Indian Service, if only because Consular duties in Persia in the present circumstances have largely an administrative complexion and Indian Service officers are accustomed to administration. I think he was well disposed to the suggestion, which might be taken further as soon as we are in a position to appoint a successor to Maoann. The suggestion had in fact been made in Squire*s time but it was impossible to carry out then for the reason that he wets so heavily occupied with wheat collection. /3* R.T. Peel, Esq., C.B.S., M.C., India Office, Whitehall, London, S.W.1.1 r i % &gt; v r / | x w , LJ V &gt; \ 3* There is a further aspect of this question which anyone accustomed to conditions in the East would X think regard as of importance. There must he a considerable difference of emphasis as between town and country in Consular duties in countries such as Persia and in European countries or America. In a country such as Persia, particularly at the present time when there is so much work of quasi-admini strative character to be put through, a Consul, who does not know the whole of his District and the villages and the tribes, is unlikely to be able to achieve much. &gt;faile this point will probably be accepted^ it is obvious that it has not been possible to do much as yet to provide Consular officers with the means to tour. In most cases in Persia those Consuls who went from India originally imported their own cars which are now wearing out and they are unable to obtain spare parts. In one case that Bullard himself mentioned to me, that of Fletcher now Consul General Ahwaz, great assistance was offered by the Commander of PAIC who made a station-wagon available, but while I was in Teheran its return was demanded* Meanwhile it appears that the Russian colleagues of His Majesty’s Consuls in Persia have everything they want including in many cases jeeps. I am unable to vouch for either story, but I was told of a case of one Consul in Persia who had to call recently on the local Governor General in a droahky, and of another who found himself compelled to ask his Russian colleague for transport. It is not easy for us in India to take this matter up to cover the Consulates staffed from India, since in such case the Finance Department would reasonably decline to make a contribution except in compliance with general principles laid down by His Llajesty f s Government, and it seems to us that the whole matter requires consideration at a high level. The varioxas para-&lt;nilitaiy and Intelligence organizations are usually even now able to obtain the transport they want, that is to say the war-time growths get what they need while the permanent men are relegated to the background. There can be little doubt that the provision of Government transport for Consuls would be a few v ,S' KAREgR/l3&gt;7»Vf great step forward in enlarging their capacity for work and, what is just as important in a country like Persia, in giving them face both with the Persians and with their opposite numbers among our Allies* May we su gg est without impertinence that the matter is one on which the Foreign Office might well consult Bullard when he is in London? In a country like Persia what seems really wanted is a decent car for official visits work in towns and so on, and a jeep for rough touring* I am sending a copy of this letter to Lascelles* Yours sincerely, (Sgd) 0*K* Caroe.Any reply to this letter should be addressed to — THE SECRETARY Yo'ur lieferenee.l&amp;yZE ^jfy | iNOEXtf Sir, y Reference.

Previous Papers: A.G. 3601 A 2 . 6th March, 1942.i I N U T E Hitherto certain items of expenditure in the Persian Gulf and Persia have been earmarked as 'special wartime expenditure” whose allocation between Imperial and Indian revenues is left for settlement in accordance with whatever general arrangements are reached between the two Governments. In the meantime each Government mefets the whole cost of those items which arise at posts where they normally make the initial payments. Y/e have never contemplated that the question of the incidence of t-h« expenditure should be settled until after the war; and, although we have no written confiixnation of this presuaption, it is believed that it is shared by the other Departments concerned. in their letter of November 12th below, the Government of India announced their intention (apparently without wait ing for the agreement of Kis Majesty^ Government) to treat all this expenditure, pending a settlement of the question of incidence, as divisible between Imperial and Indian revenues in the same proportion as peace-time expenditure, i.e. diplomatic and consular expenditure, which is divisible in moieties between the two Governments. It is not clear whether the Government of India*s action is prompted by some accounting difficulty, or bv their fear that the fact that they are meeting the greater part of the expenditure initially will prejudice their position when the basis of allocation comes,to be determined. The question has been discussed with the Financial Secretary in notes whichvrill be found below. He points out that the sum of money involved is trifling in comparison with other war-time expenditure; and he is apprehensive of repercussions upon the far more important question of the allocation of military expenditure. He therefore advises that no steps should be taKen to pursue the question with H.M.G. at present. ihis Department agrees with the Financial Secretary^ view, and a draft letter to the Government of India in accordance • therewith is accordingly submitted.

The government of India have been inclined to be troublesome from the start of the war over these questions of incidence of expenditure, in the case of certain military stores for muscat in September 1939 we ’.vere up because the Government of India insisted that H.M.G. should pay, and finally the Air ministry were persuaded to pay for the moment, ^hile reserving their right to raise the question of incidence at the end the war.

The references made in paragraphs 2 and. 3 of the Government of India’s letter are flagged in the attached files, but the general position can be briefly stated. It is that no decision has yet been taken with regard to the allocation between Imperial and Indian revenues of expenditure earmarked as 'wartime expenditure in the Persian Gulf'; and our understanding is that the incidence of such expenditure will be decided only after the war. I have been unable to find written confiimation of this understanding; but that it probably corresponds to facts is indicated by 2«Jiss Odgers’ note of September 20th last (flagged). The extent to which H.M.G. have agreed to treat as 'wartime expenditure' the items on the list enclosed with the Government of India’s letter is shown below. It will be observed that the list covers Persia as well as the Gulf. 1. Items (a) ' 0 , . . to (d) have been accepted as war expenditure (P.Z.5103/39J, except for customs compensatory allowance which was a later addition. In respect of this latter item, the Government of India evidently followed the rule applicable to diplomatic and consular expenditure that either they or H.m.G. may sanction items costing not more than £100 a year without reference to the other. (Since the date of the Government of India’s letter, sanction has been given to the appointment of three more upper division clerks on the same terms as those on the existing war establisixnent - see Ext.lOg/42). x ndia appear to have sanctioned and earmarked as war expenditure without reference heme.3* Sanctioned as war expenditure by the Government of India without reference to HUM.G.

The Government of India accepted this suggestion but made a counter^-proposal which was not pursued (P.Z. 4452/39). 6. Accepted by H.M.G. as war expenditure (P.Z. 7259/39). 7. tfe have agreed with the ,ar Office that, ’’subject to any decision affecting this case which may be taken in regard to war expenditure generally, half the cost of this typist should be borne by Indian revenues” (M 373/40). 8. Presumably accepted by H.M.G. as war expenditure though the Foreign Office letter did not make this entirely clear. (See notes exchanged with your Department at P.Z. 2667/40). 9. It was suggested to the Government of India that this itan should be dealt with under the Indian Defence Expenditure Han . The Government of India replied/diat they agreed that the “ expenditure should be divided 'in accordance with the plan that may be agreed upon to govern wartime expenditure in the Persian Gulf, after the gift of £30,000 from the Sheikh of Bahrein has been taken into account”, (P.Z. 939/41). In paragraph 4 of their letter the Government of India suggest that it is too much to ask them to bear the cost of all these items until the basis of allocation is determined. (Actually I doubt whether the Government of India*s statement that all this expenditure is being charged to India is true; the cost of the Tehran Legation (items 7 snd 8) is met in the first place by the Foreign Office, and the Government of India can hardly be paying for item 5 when they do not know how much money is involved.) V/hile the Government of India do not ask tiiay question of incidence should be settled iiianediately, they /proposepropose to treat all this expenditure as divisible between Imperial and Indian revenues in the same proportion as peacetime expenditure, i«e. 50-50. It appears that the Government of India intend to adopt this arrangement forthwith, without waiting for the agreement of Nevertheless we should presumably make enquiries with the object qf* finding out whether any objection is seen here to the course p* jposed. It will perhaps be best to approach the Treasury direct, sending a copy of the papers to the Foreign Office (the latter Department is concerned with items 1-4- and 8, and perhaps 7; 5 is largely the concern of the Admiralty; on 6 our previous correspondence has been with the Treasury, on 7 with the War Office and on 9 with the Air i'iinistry). We should be grateful for your views. Do you consider the Government of Indian attitude reasonable? (intld) E.W.R.LFIHAflCIAL IEPARTi^T iiiy own feeling is that we should be well advised not to take any steps to pursue this question with H»M«G- # at the moment* ,/e already have an understanding with them that the expenditure question shall be divided in the light of whatever settlement is reached after the war in regard to wartime expenditure in the Gulf as a whole and it can do the Government of India no harm to leave the matter over until after the war* They themselves do not pretend that the question of a lakh a year — for under any arrangement they could not expect to pay less than half - is a matter of serious concern to them and, in the light of other costs which they are having to bear owing to the war, it is the merest bagatelle. I am nervous lest any pressure on our part for special treatment of this comparatively trifling expenditure should lead H.M.G. to examine afresh the whole question of military expenditure in Persia and to suggest that half of the whole of the costs arising there throughout the war should be borne by India. .It would, in my view, be much wiser to leave things as they are at present.

A/2.Ext, 386/42 4th idarch, 1942# BY AIR ]&gt;iAIL Sir, • I am directed by the Secretary of °tate to refer to your letter No,D* 3952-N/41 of the 12th November, 1941, regarding the allocation of war-time expenditure in the Persian Gulf and Persia, 24th Peb, Approved Jt, Bol, &amp; Spec, Finance Cttee, 2, Neither the Secretary of ^tate nor, so far as he is aware, the other competent Deparlanents of H,M,G« have ever contemplated that the question of the incidence of this special expenditure should be settled until after the war. His understanding has always been that each separate item of such expenditure should, by agreement between and the Government of India, be earmarked as war expenditure to be divided ultimately on the basis of whatever general arrangements are reached between the two Governments, In the meantime, the cost of these items would be met by the Government which normally makes the initial payments at the posts concerned. the 3, Although it would appear to be/case that the majority, if not the whole, of the expenditure in question has for the time being been charged to India, I am to point out that the amount involved, which the Government of India estimate to be approximately 2 lakhs, is inconsiderable in cauparison with other war-time expenditure. The Secretary of State is moreover apprehensive that a request that the Government of India should be accorded special treahnent in respect of this comparatively trifling expenditure might lead H.i*4G. to examine afresh the whole question of military The -advisers concur. 2nd inarch, 1942 The Secretary to the Government of India, External Affairs Department. / expenditureexpenditure in Persia, and to suggest that half of the* whole costs arising there throughout the war should be borne upon Indian revenues. For these reasons, and in the absence of more pressing considerations than those advanced in your letter, the Secretary of State is reluctant to take any steps to pursue this question with at present; and he hopes that the Government of India will agree to take no action on the lines indicated in the last sentence of your letter.

In 1938 the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf in his telegram No.T.255, dated the 28th September 1938, proposed that in the event of war he should have a fund at his disposal for special intelligence. In his express letter No. P.Z. 715*4/38, dated 24th October, 1938, the Secretary of State presumed that the contemplated emergency expenditure would be shared between His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India under the existing arrangement. In the Express letter from the Government of India in the External Affairs Deparhnent, No.P. 472-N/38, dated the 8th November, 1938, the Secretary of State was informed that this special expenditure should be excluded from the sphere of divisible expenditure, as most of it was likely to be in the interest of His Majesty’s Government, and allocated between the two Governments in conformity with any general principles which may govern the allocation of wartime expenditure between England and India. Subsequently certain other proposals for war expenditure in Persia and Persian Gulf were sanctioned subject to the condition referred to above, c.f. Express letter frcm the Government of India No.D.640-E/39, dated the 3rd July, 1939. 3. Apparently the intention 'ssas to pursue the question an d to settle the basis of the allocation of this special expenditure but no action appears to have been taken in this connection, and ultimately the India Office and their demi-official letter No. P.Z. 29o7/40, dated the 29 th July, 1940 presumed that the questionhad 'been reserved far consideration after the war' and on this basis suggested that the wider question of the allocation of special peace-time expenditure in Persia and Persian Gulf should also be postponed. c • s 4. It appears that the entire wartime expenditure in the Persian Gulf and Persia which has been sanctioned is being charged to India and the position in regard to this expenditure is therefore even worse than that of the peacetime expenditure. A list of the items of special wartime expenditure whose allocation is outstanding (with the exception of the one relating to Hormuz salt which is under separate consideration) has been prepared and is attached. The total expenditure amounts to 3s. 2 lakhs approximately. This is a fairly / substantial sun and while the Government of India do not ask that the question of the allocation of this expenditure should . be settled immediately, they see no reason why the expenditure pending such decision should not be divided between the two Governments in the same proportion as the peace-time expenditure. They accordingly propose to include this expenditure in the next statement of divisible expenditure and to take similar action in future in regard to items of this nature.
