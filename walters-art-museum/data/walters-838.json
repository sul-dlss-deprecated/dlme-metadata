The central niche probably represents a \"mihrab,\" orienting the building to Mecca. The large lamp, rendered here in blue, is typical of traditional lighting fixtures in mosques and other religious buildings. It hangs over a low, cross-shaped bookstand intended to hold a copy of the Qur'an. The lines of what look like Arabic writing above the stand are not legible and probably were meant to imitate Qur'anic verses.", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/36114", "Keywords": null, "Provenance": "Dikran Kelekian, Paris and New York; Henry Walters, Baltimore, by purchase; Walters Art Museum, 1931, by bequest.", "Dynasty": null, "Reign": null, "OnView": 1, "PublicAccessDate": "2008-09-25T17:26:17.877", "Creator": "Syrian", "PrimaryImage": {"Tiny": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PL7_48.1086_Fnt_NF_H65.jpg?width=50", "Small": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PL7_48.1086_Fnt_NF_H65.jpg?width=100", "Medium": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PL7_48.1086_Fnt_NF_H65.jpg?width=150", "Large": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PL7_48.1086_Fnt_NF_H65.jpg?width=250", "Raw": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PL7_48.1086_Fnt_NF_H65.jpg"}, "GeoIDs": "1499705", "ExhibIDs": "", "Images": "PL7_48.1086_Fnt_BW.jpg, PL7_48.1086_Fnt_NF_H65.jpg", "DisplayLocation": "Centre Street: Third Floor: Islamic Art"}
