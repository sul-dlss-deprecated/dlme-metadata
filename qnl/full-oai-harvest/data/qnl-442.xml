The first three of these reports are ascribed to an individual called Hajee Abdool Cassim, and are present in the volume in Arabic original and English translation. The author of the last two reports is unclear.The second part of the volume contains correspondence relating to arrangements for the excavation of Bahrain’s tumuli. There are a number of letters dated 1879 (folios 49, 52, 53, 58, 59-60) exchanged between Lieutenant-Colonel Edward Ross, Resident in the Persian Gulf, and the Principal Librarian of the British Museum (Edward Bond), the latter being eager to initiate excavations of the tumuli at Bahrain, and forwarding funds of £100 sterling for the project. Later correspondence covers arrangements for the purchase and delivery of pickaxes to Bahrain for the excavations (folios 61-74), and arrangements and letters of recommendation to Shaikh Esau bin Khuleefah [Shaikh ‘Īsá bin ‘Alī Āl Khalīfah] for Theodor and Mabel Bent to visit Bahrain in 1889 to undertake excavations (folios 91-98).Note that Durand’s notes on the antiquities of Bahrain, cited in the original file title, are not themselves included in the volume.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter book</genre><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Bahrain</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Museum, Principal Librarian</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="family"><namePart>'Utūb (Tribe)</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Bahrain</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Archaeological excavations</topic></subject><subject><topic>Archaeology</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0000a5#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0000a5#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0000a5#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0000a5#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
