The map indicates: international boundaries; the Caspian Sea and Lake Urmieh [Urmia]; key towns and cities; roads and railways connecting key cities. The map accompanies a note (f 154) sent by the Foreign Office to the Ministry of Fuel and Power, dated 4 October 1946, discussing the boundaries of the proposed Russian [Soviet] oil concession in northern Persia [Iran]. The note states that the map is a Latinised copy of one provided by the Persian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The thick black line marked on the map is not annotated, but is presumably the oil concession boundary discussed in the note.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><geographic>Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100062344557.0x000001#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
