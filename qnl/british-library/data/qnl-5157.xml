ARG.Extract from Lingak Memorandum No. 111-25/1, dated May 9th, 1945. 7* In this connection it may be pointed out that the crews of Arab countrycraft carry arms and ammunition ostensibly for the purpose of self-defence against raid ers along the Persian and/or Arab coast. It is difficult for the Persian officials to keep a check on this as the nakhodas do not carry any documents to cover such 'Weapons which can be easily disposed of. A case in point arose in Lingah a few months ago. It was reported to me that a boat from Dubai had a couple of rifles on board and the Consular Agent informed the Director of Customs per sonally, and requested the latter to have a search made. This was done and the weapons were traced. The Consular Agent requested the Director of Customs to force the nakhoda to obtain a permit from his Euler or Customs officials on the production of which the arms could be returned. This was accordingly done. It is therefore suggested, if there is no objection, that the Rulers of the Arab States be requested to instruct their subjects that in case they are forced to carry arms in self- defence they must obtain permits which should be produced to Persian Customs or other officials. Even this procedure will not, in my humble opinion, prevent the traffic owing to the long coast line and lack of supervision unless the Eulers enforce the return of the permits with the arms etc., which could be stored until they set out again. A registration system may check the smuggling to a certain degree.No. C/1121. Political Agency, Bahrain, The 11th December, 1945. To The Acting Adviser to the Bahrain Government, Bahrain .

The case has however called my attention to the fact that apparently permits are not issued for arms carried in the Trucial Coast.dhows, and I would suggest you should consider the desirability of instituting a permit system as this may deter the Persians from seizing such arms, and incidentally, will also protect them from seizure by the Royal Navy should they make any searches.

F*9/l-B(below)• It is customary practice at all ports in P.G. for visiting nakhudas to declare the number of rifles they have on board and to deposit these with the customs or police authorities of the port. This is procedure adopted by Bahrain Government for Persian nakhudas, and others. I understand Bahrain nakhudas usually carry the Bahrain Government licence with them for any arms they have in their possession and we may address Bahrain Government asking them to make clause 8 of Arms Ordinance applicable to officials of other territories and clauses 9-11 applicable to Bahrainis visiting foreign territories. With regard to Trucial coast (and Qatar) there is no arms registration system in force and P.A. may wish to consult A.P.A. and P.O.T.C. and visit these territories before addressing Shaikhs. in this connection we may have to raise the question of reciprocal measures by the Persian authorities. I understand that Persian nakhudas do not usually produce ai±x a licence for any arms they have on board when visiting Bahrain. P.A. 18.11.'45. On return from tour please. ltd. A.G.G. ' 18/11/45.
