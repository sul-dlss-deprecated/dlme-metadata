WITH reference to my despatch No. 340 of the 15th May, inclosing a despatch from His Majesty's Consul-General at Bagdad, reporting the departure of a small force of Turkish infantry and artillery to Nasariye on the Tigris to operate against Sadoun Pasha of the Muntefik, I have the honour to transmit herewith to your Lordship copy of a despatch which I have received from His Majesty's Consul at Bussorah, reporting the return on the 22nd October of the Vali, Mouklis Pasha, from the Muntefik, where he had been directing a punitive expedition against Sadoun. Although the Vali claims to have been successful in capturing some of his strongholds, and to have sequestered his lands, he appears to have failed to lay hands on this notorious Arab Chief, who made good his escape into the Syrian deseit.

I HAVE the honour to report that the Vali returned from liuntetik on the 22nd October. I called on his Excellency, and inquired the result ot his Mission. The Vali said that Sadoun's importance had been much exaggerated. He ha been accused of acts which he never committed, and many mistakes had ^ On a previous occasion the Imperial pardon had been granted him, but he did not merit it He was a troublesome man, and a source ot unrest m the distnct, and Vali had recommended that, unless he settled down, and abandoned his Predatory habits no clemency ought to be shown him. After a careful inquiry on the spot the Vali had come to the conclusion that Sadoun was a man of no who had taken advantage of his family name to collect a few .olloweis and tyran over a few tribes in Muntefik, and exact tribute from them to w ^ h entitled. Sadoun had now taken refuge from pursuit somewhere m S y' an and in order to bring him to his senses, the Vali stated that he had stopped allowance which he received from the Imperial Government, and pestered certain of his lands, so that he could derive no benefit from them. The ^ Jt means to reduce him to submission, but he did not anticipate any sat y and thought Sadoun was likely to give trouble. From other sources I hear that the Vali pursued Sadoun ; an n d „ ivei ; but be escaped into the desert; that he sequestered a by the Sultan to Sadoun, and established the El Bedur t rlbe r ^d in the place; that he destroyed four strongholds belonging to provisions from them; that he exiled about ten persons lessees of ^ | charged with mischief and corruption at Nasanye; and that he forced the Cad Nasariye to resign by the somewhat drastic method of placing him under guaid m tne sun until he agreed to tender his resignation. 1 , r&gt; After these acts the Vali left Nasariye, and returned to Bushorah.^ (Signed) P 1 .

Sir N. 0 Conor to the Marquess of Lansdowne.—(Received December 18.) (No. 902. Confidential.) My Lord, Constantinople, December 11, 1905. I HAVE the honour to forward to your Lordship herewith copy of a despatch from His Majesty's Consul at Bussorah relating to the condition of Turkish troops in Central Arabia and the political situation there. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) N. B. O'CONOB. Inclosure in No. 1. Consul Crow to Sir N. 0'Conor. (No. 75. Confidential.) Sir, B ussGvoh, JSovemher 18, 1905. FROM information collected here, I learn that of the troops who went to Ghassim last year many died of starvation and many deserted. Some forty fugitives reached Kovveit three weeks ago in a pitiable plight. The Sheikh provided them with clothing and money, hired a dhow for them, and sent them on to Bussorah. Two officers, Beshid Bey, a Major, and Husni Bey, a Lieutenant-Colonel, left the troops in Grhassim and arrived recently in Bussorah. The latter came by way of Koweit with about fifteen men. He is said to be on his way to Egypt. Orders were sent from Bagdad some weeks ago to Sudgi Pasha, in command of the troops in Ghassim, to discharge about 180 time-expired men. On checking the list it was found that of the 180 men only 18 remained, and the rest had died. It is stated that the soldiers in Ghassim have received no pay, and that half the provisions sent from Medina were looted by the Arabs on the way. The troops now in Ghassim are said to number about 750. Husni Bey seems to have quarrelled with his commanding officer, Sudgi Pasha, and to have left his post without leave. His account of the condition of the troops in Central Arabia may be highly coloured, but as regards numbers his version seems to agree roughly with that given by the Sheikh Mubarak to the Political Agent at Koweit. The .Resident at Bushire has sent me a copy of a statement made by Sheikh Mubarak to Captain Knox, describing the political situation in the interior of Arabia in October 1905. The Sheikh's account is as follows :— Bin Beshid is not strong, even in Hail,Hamood, his uncle, and brother of Mohamed-bin-Reshid, is in charge, and has lost four sons in the recent fighting. Their names are Maid, Salim, Mohamed, and Obeyd. He has three sons left. The eldest is Sultan, who is at enmity with the rest of the family and lives at Jof. He has recently been in correspondence with Sheikh Mubarak. The other two, Saoud and Eeysul, are with their father Hamood in Hail. Abdul Aziz-bin-Metaab, the Chief of the Bin Reshid family, has not resided at Hail for the last six years, but is constantly wandering in the desert. The state of the town of Hail is deplorable. The population consists of Bin Reshid's soldiers. The residents, having no means of livelihood, have dispersed to other towns, selling their property to provide money for their journey. Abdur Rahman-bin-Eeysul, the head of the Saoud family, is at Riad. The town anu district are prosperous. There is no truth in the story of a rising at Sedeyr against Bin Saoud's power. There are no Turkish troops or Turkish Representatives in Riad. Abdul Aziz-bin- Saoud, the eldest son of Abdur Rahman, lies armed in Boregda. There are fifty Turkish ^ soldiers in Boregda, and thirty in Aneyza, but no Turkish civil Representative. The main body of the Turkish troops is at Shebiyeh, five hours north-west of Boregda. [2294 s—1]They number 600, with eight guns, hut are being constantly They originally numbered 7,000. They are under the orders of a Feiik badig Pasha. Ghassim is prosperous. No Turkish customs have oeen established, and caravan come and go between Koweit and Nejd unmolested. &lt; . , . . Sheikh Mubarak states that the general situation m the interior is entirely satisfactory from his point of view and that of his friends of the Bm uaoud faction. Captain Knox adds that none of Mubarak's assertions have been verified, and that the description of the Turkish troops sounds improbable. Prom a source not it ^ iNfnKm.oV rin-nfnin Tvnox' learns that 13in Saoud's neonle[Confidential.] No. 64, dated Bushire, the 23rd February (received 6th March) 1906. From—M ajor P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. With reference to the correspondence ending with Foreign Department endorsement No. 429-E. B., dated 30th January 1906, I have the honour to furnish the following information bearing on the situation in Nejd. 2. On the 12th instant, I received a communication from the Political Agent, Bahrein, to the effect that an emissary of Ibn Saood named Musaad bin Suweilim had arrived at Bahrein via El Bida and had called at the Agency. He informed Captain Prideaux that Ibn Saood felt himself strong enough to turn the Turks out of Hassa and Katif and then wished to enter into treaty relations with us, allowing us if we desired to keep a Political Officer in Hassa or Katif in return for our protecting him from a sea attack from the Turks. Captain Prideaux expressed his personal doubts as to whether Ibn Saood was strong enough to free himself from the Turks, and otherwise refrained from giving any encouragement to Musaad's suggestions, and the old gentleman left the Agency in a somewhat disappointed mood saying that he intended to proceed to Bushire by the next mail for medical treatment. 8. On the same date three Nejdi Arabs arrived in Bushire and I had their movements watched as reported in item No. 180 of this Office Political Diary for the week ending 18th February 1906. They proved to be Musaad bin Suweilim and two companions. They stayed with Najaf bin Ghalib, the Koweiti merchant living in Bushire, and on the 18th instant they sent a long and expensive telegram to His Majesty the Sultan in Romanized Arabic of which I attach a translation. It will be seen that it actually purports to come from Sheikh Jasim bin Thani but was evidently sent on behalf of, and in communi cation with, Ibn Saood. With reference to the first-named veteran, it is interesting to note that at the end of the telegram, as transliterated for delivery to the telegraph office, he describes himself; ' Kayem Mekam Kaze Katr ve reiese ashayeraha ve kebayelleha al abdusadek Jassim al Sani.' I am doubtful whether this is intended to mean; ' Kaim Mukam of the Kaza of Katr and Chief of its clans and tribes, the faithful slave Jassim al Thani' or; ' Kaim Mukam and Kazi of Katr and Chief of its clans and tribes, the faithful slave Jassim al Thani' Whichever it be. Sheikh Jassim poses as the humble slave of His Majesty the Sultan, whereas in a letter to the Political Agent, Bahrein, which must have been written about the same time as the above telegram, he^ rather went out of his way to mention the fact that he considered himself subject to Sheikh Esa of Bahrein. 4. The position seems to be that Ibn Saood is exasperated by the neglect of the Turks to suppress Ibu Rashid, and that he (Ibn Saood) and Sheikh Jassim, whose sympathies are with him, are sitting on the hedge at present and apparently sent this representative, Musaad bin Sweilim, with instructions to sound the British representative in the first place, and, if he received no encouragement from the latter, to proceedlto Bushire and send the above telegram to the Sultan. My informant tells me that the Arabs expected to receive their reply via Basrah and it was therefore no use their remaining here longer. They left again for Bahrein on the 21st instant, and I may mention that they did not visit the Residency during their stay in Bushire. 5. I am forwarding a copy of this communication to His Majesty's Consul) Basrah, for information. 5150 F.D.2 Translation o! a telegram despatclied in Romanized Arabic to His Majesty the Sultan, Constantinople, from Bushire by a representative of Ibn Saood and oheikh Jassun bin Tbani, on the 18fcli February 1906. To His Imperial Majesty the Sultan, Commander o£ the Faithful, May God uphold his Imperial Throne with Glory and Victory. Whereas my devotion, honesty, sincerity, friendliness, zeal and sense of honour do not allow me to discontinue tendering advice to my religion, my Government and my Sultan, whether they are accepted or not, a petition was previously made by this loyal slave suggesting the undesirability of employing a hcdy of Imperial troops against Ibn Saood—a course lor which there v^as no necessity. The eftect of my advices is now apparent as also are the disturbances caused by interested persons who are unable to derive profit in cash, money, or opportunity except by creating difficulties and troubles like these under reference. Indeed I stated my opinion on the occurrence of each incident which I considered harmful to the Turkish Empire and to its faith and its subjects, and which emanated from Amir Abdul Aziz bin Rashid from the time when Amir Mohamed died and the affairs of the State passed into the hands of the said Abdul Aziz bin Eashid. He massacred the faithful and plundered their property; he put men to death and killed children; and disturbance became general in the country, and the lawless Arabs were encouraged to infest the roads and highways along which the dependents of the Government dwelt. When things came to this pass pious men seeing the harm suffered by Musulmans, came forward and solicited Ibn Saood to ward off difficulties which befell them in their sorry plight. Accordingly Ibn Saood arose and pined them. He expelled the evil-doers and wicked persons and secured tranquillity to the country and people by his excellent behaviour and high character and by his righteous services to the Great Lord, the Commander of the faithful, and the successor of the Prophet of God of the two worlds. He still remains ready to render service, and submissive to Government, and protects all the roads, and all the people testify to this. He is beloved by everybody in general. Ibn Saood has indeed repeatedly, invoked favour saying that he is an obedient servant of the Commander of the faithful and that he is neither schismatic nor a rebel. On the other hand, according to what I hear, Ibn Hashid ceases not to supply material for suspicion to interested persons and to give them bribes with a view to their making misrepresentations and accusations; and therefore all the Musulmans beseech the Great Lord and Commander of the Paithful not to listen to the statements of such interested persons who are the enemies of the State and of the faith, and who are liars and false accusers. Similarly I pray that this my counsel may not be treated with indifference; and the order and command rest with His Majesty; and may Peace rest upon Mahomed and his family.

From— M ajor P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. Having spent three days at Koweit during last week, I have the honour to submit, for the information of Government, a few observations regarding the present aspect of affairs there. I met Sheikh Mubarak on three occasions, and on 7th instant had a lengthy interview with him at the Agency, for the details of which I beg reference to the attached memorandum drawn up for me by Captain Knox who was likewise present. It will be seen that during it several topics were touched upon, some of which are subjects of separate correspondence. 2. The trend of our conversation regarding the affairs of Central Arabia, which* was started by Sheikh Mubarak, is of some significance. The possibi lity of the Ruler of Koweit smoking the calumet of peace with Bm Kashid, and Mubarak 's own vision of a three-cornered compact between himselt, Bin Eashid and Bin Saood, which would in practice probably be found to amount to a defensive alliance for resistance to Turkish expansion m Nejd and Hassa, is an interesting, if somewhat Utopian, prospect to contemplate. It is to be feared however that Sheikh Mubarak's own ambitions, as indi cated in the second of the conditions suggested by him to Bin Bashid, are likely to form the chief obstacle to such a development. On the other hand, there is no doubt that in the course of the strife of the last few years both Bin Saood and Bin Rashid must have been brought to realise what a strong position the Ruler of Koweit, territorially situated as he is occupies both strategically and politically in relation to them, and they evidently see the advantage of maintaining friendly relations with him. In connection with Bin Saood's doings I may remark it is possible that hii* recent telegram to the Porte was sent to disarm suspicion Preparatory to some further move, as recent reports from Bahrein show that the Turks are now having trouble at Hofuf, in which it seems possible, if not probable, that Bm Saood has had an indirect hand. 3 As for Sheikh Mubarak's attitude towards ourselves, I do not consider that on the whole it gives any present cause for dissatisfaction or anxiety; rather the contrary. As long as the practical expression of his sentiments in regard to us undergoes no change, the improvement of the relations between Mubarak and the Turkish authorities at Basrah, within reasonable limits, is Ser a convenience to us than otherwise. The Sheikh's treatment of our Ao'ent and his invariable demeanour towards myself could not be more sa is- factory and sensible than it is. He has always treated Captain Knox exceed ingly well; more so than ever lately, and it is a matter of satisfaction to me as it wfll I am sure, be to Government that our representative seems cleaily to have gained Sheikh Mubarak's personal regard, and that he 15 visited freely in aTriendlv way by many of the Sheikh's subjects. He is thus making useful influence of a kind which seems to be all we require at present and which we can legitimately cultivate. ^ . It is onlv in regard to the arms question that the position at the present moment leaves much to be desired,Vd this is partly owing the general question of the Gulf arms traffio is sai judtce. ™o not know quite what line to take with the Sheikh in the event of our ha Tl ng an pvhaustive exchange of views in this connection, and until i am sure ot our inten^ioM it seem' better for me to keep off the subject and avoid any specific discussion with him. . . t a i 4 The question of the conveyance of the Turkish postal bag Hassa of wCh a good deal has been said, has I think been somewhat misunderstood, and I concur with the Political Agent m thinking that the 5628 p. d,is nothing in the existing working arrangement wTiicli need cause us to take exception to, or be exercised by, Sheikh Mubarak's connection with it. Note of a conversation between the Resident in the Persian Gulf and S heikh M ubarak of Koweit, dated 7th March 19U6. On 7th March 1906, at 4 p.m ., the Sheikh of Koweit returned the informal visit paid by the Resident on the previous day. The present interview lasted about an hour and a half, and Sheikh Mubarak was friendly and cordial as usual. The Sheikh informed the Resident that he thought he would be interested ,, _ to hear that he had lately, on 24th (l) The prcpecte Of peace in the interior. February (29th Zi-ul-Haj),'received a letter from Bin Rash id couched in friendly language and proposing that Sheikh Mubarak, should be on the same terms of friendship with him as the Rulers of Koweit had been with his uncle and grandfather before him. The Sheikh said that he had replied to Bin Rashid that he, Mubarak, was a man who loved peace and quietness and would welcome friendly relations with him, provided that Bin Rashid would keep within his own boundaries and not harass his neighbours, and was really sincere in his desire for peace. The Resident, in the way of friendly interest, asked how peace could be arranged between the two ; whether a personal meeting would be necessary or whether trusted messengers would be sent. The Sheikh replied that it would be done by correspondence and that a meeting would be unnecessary. He proceeded to sketch the terms on which, in his opinion, a reconciliation between him and Bin Rashid could be con sidered practicable. These were :— • (i) That Bin Rashid should have Chhaffa (Kaffa) and Hail, and the Bedouins of Jebel Shammar. (n) That he, Bin Sabah, should have Koweit, Aneyza, Borevda Sedeyr and TV ashm and should control the tribes occupying them, (iii) That Bil1 Saood should have Nejd and the Wadi Dowasir. v The Resident asked if Sheikh Mubarak thought that he would be able to keep the parties to their agreement with himself and with one another • and the Sheikh replied that he could. 1 he Resident then asked whether under such circumstances Bin Rasbid would have sufficient mcome to enable him to live without harrying his Sheikh M . ub l arak ^plied that he would have Hail and Chhaffct t le Zakat ot Slmmmar and the produce of forays on the Harb and AnevzV tnoes between Hail and Medina. 1 /ineyzi t , he Turks would ' ia Ws opinion, take ot this trinle disfavour Mubarak replied that they would undoubtedly regard it with The Resident then asked whether the relations between Sheikh Mubarak Saood. relatione between Bin Sabah and Ein and Bin Saood Continued the 'same as replied that they did. and that Bin SaooTstiU Mubarak Co X then thanked the Sheikh for his cTonerali f n l! adV1Ce ; Ma j or regarding Bin Saood's alleged intention to visit Oman aSCertalmn S the truth and Sr^CTH^iS th^tLt w^^ 3,80 WritteD to him and that Bin Saood had quite enough to do where he was fo' ap l ,reh f e . nsion &gt; come. ° nere ne was for some time to ConstantinoplTthTong^J^^bln^han^ r ff m f Sent from Busll ' r e to no' consulted hiXlore indT^n'rf'who sent the telegram, but admitted that he had heard nothing on the suhWt direct from the Bin Saood family or from Abd-ur-Rahman. He thought this was because the telegram had been inspired by Sheikh Jasim bin Thani of whom he spoke in no very favourable terms. ' Sheikh Mubarak next mentioned that Nasir bin Mubarak of the El (3) Visit to Koweit of Nasir Mn Mubarak the Khalifah family had iust been Davinff outlaw relative of the Sheikh of Bahrein. him nna nf Tiia • -i i t i Tin. i £ j ,0 TT Ilim one ot ms periodical visits and had only left a couple of days before. He continued that Nasir had told him of bis meeting with Captain Prideaux, and had gone on to ask him (Sheikh Mubarak) to put in a good word for him to the Resident with a view to a reconciliation being effected between himself and Sheikh Esa. Sheikh Mubarak agreed with the Eesident in thinking that Sheikh Esa wouid resent any overtures on behalf of Nasir Mubarak, and that it would be dimcult to alter the latter s circumstances during Sheik Esa's lifetime. ,.s * f f a f rr .1 Resident then introduced the tonic (4) A distinctive flag for Koweit. fi-o ^ i« » j- t ^ 01 tbe nag and ships* articles to be carried by Koweit vessels. It may be mentioned here that the Resident had brought with him a specimen flag of the pattern previously selected by Sheikh Mubarak with the addition of the word - Koweit' in Roman letters as well as Arabic. The 'articles' were read over to the Sheikh and it was explained that it was proposed that the English translation should be verified by the signature ov, ^ ar ',' t ' lis t;lle Sheikh considered would be an advantage Shakh Mubarak approved of the ' articles ' with the exception of the item chandn ° T0 thls he 0 ^J ec ' e( J' as the Nakhodas were always i w 6 S, i l v l ' I D thf i n ' ns P e&lt;,t «'l the flag, and after doing so said that he would lay before the Resident what appeared to him the objections to the use of the flag as now shown him and that then, if the Resident did not consider the objections of any weight, he would be prepared to order his subjects to adopt the new pattern. ^ . The Shei ^ h ^^^P^ined his objections at some length. He recited his grievances against the Turks and their oppression in the matter of his Eao date gardens and their ingratitude for all he had done in their behalf. He clear y showed that he considered that all the trouble he experienced at their hands was due to his friendly attitude towards the British Government, ft He Might be eliminated. laid^ome stress on/the fact that on^n P z Cox occasion when the ^Basrah Commandant , , ' ' 0X ' cmfne to call on Majesty's Coh^uI at J3asrahp and ofte of the Sheikh's servants happened toi^e in the room^ffie Consul instead of owenly acknoWedging Sh^kh Mubarak V^osition and ^^Sm men din ^ his afervanyto the goodX)ffices of^igh Turkis^^fficers, told the servant to scivftle aw^y and hide-fiimself.lt He said in conclusion that he would accept the flag as it stood if we would give him a written guarantee to protect him against any consequences that might arise to him from its use. It proved, on further enquiry, that it was the addition of the English characters to which he objected. The reason for this addition was thoroughly explained to him, but the explanation did not remove his objections and he was therefore told that the European lettering was only a useful addition and not an essential, and he then expressed himself as quite ready to adopt the fig, without the English letters, and combined with the ' Articles,' for use bv his subjects. J Sheikh Mubarak next informed the Resident that Bin Rashid had sent a (5) The late Yusuf bin Brabim of Doura. messenger to Meshhed Ali, who had laid hands on all the money belonging to Yusuf bm Brahim in that place. tu Slleikh Mubarak ^ len went on to explain that he too had claims against the house of Bin Brahim ; that account books, in Arab merchants' dealings, were the only evidence, and that the deposits belonging to himself in the handsof Abdul a ™ bin Brabim, th \TO.OOrsZwmg^ Es. 1,30,000. and tbat tbe advances against him were x. . i , balance of Bs. 60,000 in his favour.

Notes of a tour by Captain S, G, Knox to the south of Koweit, Saturday, 24th March. —About 2 p.m. Sheikh Diaij and I started out on our tour. He had got for me a good black mare which, he told me, was Bin Saood's gift of last year to Sheikh Malieh, Diaij's brother. Malieh told me later that he used to be a partizan of (Ibn) Rashid but that Bin Saood had brought him round by the gift of this mare, some camels and some money. He complained of Arab veterinary surgery and said that the Bedouins had fired the mare for a cold and ruined her. Though quiet and easy paced, she was sluggish. We passed round by the Ras-ul-Arz beacon and found it absolutely sound though it would be the better for another coating of tar or even two. We saw a number of the townsmen's encampments on our road especially near the base of the Ras-ul-Arz. As we were approaching Funtass, we overtook an old man on a donkey who insisted on our stopping the night with him. It turned out to be a Jabir of the Al-i-Subah but he might easily have been mistaken for an old Arab fisherman. His pedigree connects in the following way :— Jabir ! r_ 'i Subah Diaij • J-. Mubarak Fazil (present Sheikh). | Jabir (my host), He must be a man of about 50 years old or even more, although he is a generation below the Sheikh ; he is a good deal older than any of Sheikh Mubarak's sons. He gave us an excellent pillau of fowls in a decent little diwaniya facing the sea at Funtass and was very anxious to know if everything was to my liking. While we were waiting for dinner. Sheikh Salim, Sheikh Mubarak's1 o to aivp me preet\r\v. I cannot place this man. He has, a e s C r t hin 0 k n i have said before elsewhere, a great reputation among the Arabs but, K K- ^ , rather solemn stately demeanour, he appears to me rude, sly or stupid behind a rath . . m j be safely reckoned on rtat r wm give Jabi 'the rightful hefr, a lot of trouble when Sheikh Mubarak dies. After his first greeting to me, he plunged straight into local politics with Diaii A rumour has come hot foot from Koweit that Sheikh Mubarak .and Bin Rashid have made friends. It reached Koweit this morning before we left. Sunday 25th March. —We were out and on horseback fairly early this .J* 5 Haleyfa where Malieh has a fort. As we passed out 7Sasfl noticed an uncomn2ly nice filly tethered by an Arab tent Diaij told me that she belonged to Abdulla el Brah.m er Rash.d of the old Sheikhs amilv of Zubair, who was paying Sheikh Sahm a v .sit. His sons were in such bad odour with the people of Zubair that they rose up against them and said that they would kill them, if they did not get out of the town. We could not find Malieh at once, so we sauntered round the cultivation which seems fresher, greener and better cared for than it did at the time of my last year's visit. The desert on the other hand was a good deal browner and wanted rain badly. (This rain fell yesterday, 27th March 1906.) After exhausting the resources of Abu Haleyfa, we returned to Malieh's diwaniya ; he came in almost at once and skilfully clearing out everybody mclud- ine his own brother Dial], he told me to make a note of the fact that he had a claim on the Fao date-gardens which he intended to press on the old man s death, not now, he explained carefully, for he was afraid. He claims a half share on account of Ali, his son by his wife Haya, daughter of Subah and Mubaraks sister. He was going to ask me and the Resident to interfere. I said that it looked to me as if we should decline to move in the matter which seemed one for the Turkish Courts. He said ' never mind 1 I am going to ask you later on and no one knows of this, not even my own brother, Diaij. ' Malieh decided to ride with us to the tents of Bishr bin Roomi, the father of the Koweit pearl merchants, and then on to the treasure pillar which we had come all this way to see. About 11 A.M., we found the tents pitched in a hollow on the western slope of Adan ridge. We came first to the women's tents, four large ones, and went on to the Diwaniya tent, pitched about 200 yards away. Here Diaij woke up the Arabs slumbering after a heavy breakfast, by bringing down a kite with his shot gun and they came out rubbing their eyes and settling their Kafiyas to wel come us. Coffee came at once and breakfast shortly. A big bowl of sourish milk with butter floating in it formed the principal dish. There were plates of honey and the Bahrein citron jam, dates of course and the common sweetmeat, rahush of date juice and sesame flour. Thin wafer -like of about 18 inches diameter served as bread. After breakfast, we rode off to the treasure pillar. This is a story from last Ramzan but it reached Koweit only a fortnight ago when Sheikh Jabir brought the zaru in from camp. An Awazimi had a dream telling him to dig by the Rijiu- i-Sufaur and they gathered a party and went off to dig. As night fell, they found masonry and the dream, dreamt thrice by the way, was coming true and the party decided to come back and dig again the next day. They camped some little distance off and, in the night, one of the party saw a light at the ruins. He went up and saw two Dawasirs of their company playing the rogue and digging on their own account. They said that they had found nothing but fled the next day and have not been seen since. The Awazimi continued digging and found remains of masonry in good condition but only, so it is said, one copper pice which Sheikh Mubarak handed over to me and I sent to the Superintendent, Persian Gulf Gazetteer. On the way, Malieh rode along with me ; poor Diaij had fallen behind, explaining to me that honey never agreed with him. This gave Malieh his3 opportunity of talking high treason for, though they will trust an Englishman, thev will not trusi t ^ e ' r own ^ rot l ier an ^ ^ betray no confidence for all they tell me is intended to reach Government. Mubarak was a miser who had 39 sources of income, none of which however helped to fill the mouths of his poorer kinsfolk. All was kept for himself and his sons. From the time of Sheikh Jabir, the Grandfather, all the previous Sheikhs had drawn a date ration from tne Turkish Government as Kaimmokams but the pay was stopped alter the murders In the old days, the Sheikh served out this ration to the various members of the Subah family and the Sheikh's predecessors had been ' ajaweed' ' This man had, it was true, brought the Sheikhdom to a pitch of power never before dreamt of (I pictured to myself the Sheikh of Koweit whom Pelly speaks of as sitting the whole afternoon on Koweit strand to see Pelly s boat floated and wondered when Mubarak would do the like for me) and he went out with a swelling purse to gain the plaudits of the beggars of the market place but completely neglected his poorer relatives. He would not even like my talking with Malieh or listening to this conver sation.' There was an artless obviousness about this last remark that made it difficult to repress a smile. Malieh had compromised the claim of Ali at the time of the murders—half to himself and half to Sheikh Mubarak—but, since the English had come in and Mubarak 's position had become more secure, he had ceased to pay even t at half. We reached the spot in the early afternoon and found that it had been dug into irregularly everywhere by the treasure seeking Bedoums, who have irre ne- vably ruined any chance of preserving and uncovering these interesting monu ments. Otherwise this might have been done at a small cost. I took bearings—to Wara hill 258° and to the west hill of Burgan 214° We found the remnants of a man's skull in one tomb and 1 think it probab e that 11 place is nothing but a cemetery of the old time kings ot in Arabia they would be called village headmen. Unmoved, I have overheard myself descriLd as 'of the kings of the English ' 1 tombs in the best preservation. It may be described as a box of t ^ jfusor local mortar about 4 inches thick.

The Sheikh has warned the merchants smuggling arms if the above arrangement and his own servants who watch the trade- to keep it strictly confidential and not to allow it to rea,ch the ears of the Fritish Consul or his staff. The informant also states that Sheikh Mobarak some days ago, in conversation with some merchants said that he had informed the Fritish Consul here that arms are not imported here by bugalows but they are imported by steamers and that he ( Fritish Consul ) should not be so inquisitive about the arms trade here. Some of the merchants sitting there told Sheikh Mobarak that the reason wX the English wish to stop the i v ft 1- M r'the inporta/bion of arms here is plain; on a convenient opportunity,the w will seize Koweit which, if the Arabs have no arms, will be defenceless.The con- -dition of Fahrein and its Sheikh is greatly excercising their minds.

I have the honour to transmit herewith copy of a despatch from His Majesty's Consul at Bussorah, reporting the outbreak of serious disturbances at Suk-el-Shiyukh, in the Muntifik, owing to the refusal of the El Hacham (Hidjam) tribes to pay the Government taxes, and the efforts of the local authorities to collect them. I have received through a secret and confidential source confirmation of the serious character of the revolt of these tribes, and of the repulse suffered by the Imperial troops which were dispatched against them. The Grand Vizier, in a communication addressed to the Minister of War, states that the Vali of Bussorah had telegraphed that on the 24th ultimo, in a conflict between the troops and the Arab tribes, 100 soldiers were killed or wounded, and their Commander, Colonel Moustapha Bey, having lost his head, the Mutessarif of Amara, together with Lieutenant-Colonel Aziz Bey, who was in the district, had been dispatched in all haste to the scene of the encounter with detachments of troops, which were immediately mobilized, from all sides. The Minister of War replied that telegraphic instructions had been sent to the Vali and Commandant of Bussorah to proceed at once to the scene of the encounter with a considerable force collected from the surrounding districts, and also to the General of the Vlth Army Corps to proceed to the spot in all haste with a considerable force taken from the head-quarters of the corps. In a subsequent message the Grand Vizier communicated to the Minister of War a further telegram from the Vali of Bussorah, pointing out the impossibility of putting down the rebel tribes with the military force which had been dispatch ed to Suk-el-Shiyukh, and urging that three more battalions, 800 strong, should be sent at once to the scene of action. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) N. R. O'CONOR. Inclosure in No. 1. Consul Crow to Sir N, 0'Conor. (No. 1}.) Sir, Bussorah, March 5, 1906. There has been serious trouble among the Arabs at Suk-el-Shiyukh, in the Sanjak of Muntifik, resulting in considerable loss of life on the side of the Tur kish troops, and the immediate recall of the Mutessarif of Muntifik to Constanti nople. The cause of the disturbances appears to have been the persistent refusal of the El Hacham tribes during the past two years to pay taxes to Government, and the attempts of the authorities to enforce payment. 1 \ :G.

I have just received an official notice that the post which left Baghdad foi Damascus on the 26th April has been lost. It is only a short time ago that one of the mail carriers on this line was murdered on his way to Baghdad. There is a chronic fued between the Shumurd and Zugurd tribes of Arabs who live in and near Nedjef. This has once more reached an acute stage. Abbas, son of the Sheikh of the Shumurd, has just been shot in the shrine at Nedjef, and it is said that the tribes have told the pilgrims to leave the place as they mean to have a free fight. I am informing the Vali of the news which has reached me and asking him to take steps to protect the lives and property of British subjects. On the Uth ultimo the town of Suk-el-Shiyukh was surrounded by El Hacham Arabs, the inhabitants were under arms temporary fortifications were thrown up, and fighting was going on. The El Hacham were aided by the Abu Hameydiand El Hassan tribes, and, as affairs were becoming serious urgent rep. resentations were made to Bussorah for the dispatch of troops. 500 Redifs were sent from Nasriye and 200 from Amara, while 300 soldiers proceeded from Bus. sorah to the scene of action; 30 gendarmes, under Lieutenant Suleyman Effendi, were attacked by the El Hacham Arabs on their way to buk-el-Shiyukh, and Suleyman Mendi was wounded. The Mutessanf of Nasriye and the Com- mandan^H the troops proceeded to Suk-el-Shiyukh to direct operations, and artillery was used against the Arabs, who were finally repulsed, it is believed, after loss of life and destruction of property. The accounts of the fighting are, how- ever, disjointed and confused, and up to the time of my leaving Amara on the 1st instant it was not clear to the minds of the Bussorah authorities what had precisely occurred. It is known on the Turkish side 16 soldiers were killed and 14 wounded, including a Major slightly and a Colonel Agassi severely wounded. I hear that the Mutessarif of Muntifik has left for Constantinople in obedience to a summons from the Sultan, who is said to be distressed at the loss of life occasioned by the disturbances. , I have, &amp;c.GOSFIDSHTIAL- jVo. 3j A copy of the foregoing cownunicatioii^ i=? forwarded to tho Political E»rridont In the Persian Gulf, for inforraation. in continuation of the endorsement from tha Government of India in the Foreign Department, Ho.

He then directed his Arab irregulars to execute the same manoeuvre in regard to the next fort. They absolutely declined to go on and while the di^cus ^ion was being prolonged the hostile Arabs closed round the fort in large numbers and poured in a destructive and unexpected fire.

In a telegram sent by the Grand Vizier to the Vali of Baghdad in reply to this message, the opinion is expressed that the position of affairs in Kassim and the neighbouring districts, brought about by the death of Ibn Hashid, is the direct outcome of the recent encroachments of the military authorities in the nro vince on the functions of the ci^iLauthorities. The Vali is to warn the Cora^ mander of the Vlth Army Corps that all interference in civil matters must now cease, and that no time must be lost in taking steps to restore tranquillitv in the disturbed districts.

It appears that Gazban was not getting all that he expected, ^ he began to give trouble by firing first on Turkish steamers and then on the 'Khalifah' (3Cth lay 1906) a British steamer. After considerable cerreaiJc/iiu&amp;nce with the Vali of Baghdad, wh© is/ S 2. ,£) is als© iia charge ©f Das rah he (Ivlajid ^ejr) ijsforrr.ed me the 4th J'ii]ie 19 06 that the ^. b / .( £&gt; oje the steamers had been caused dv the puerile 'behaviour of some silly ivrabs of the nmarah tribe, xhe ]iext thiMg I heard xkxk was xhat Sheikh iinx Sazbaa had erected a mud fort © a the jjaak ©f the Tigris amd I have satisfied myself that the report is correct. 3 • Fajid joey wejit to /imarah to iiold a j &amp; enquiry a^sid arrive at some settlement, he took with him the xjakih of Baghdad. *rhQ current belief is that the vali wishes to give the disputed tract knew* as Eumait to a nominee cf u-azban's, whose name I have aot been able t© learn , and that Gazban has obtained a decision in his favour 'by the fimilar process of bribing the Vali. It is said that he has paid £.T. 2,500 and there is some reason to think that the story is approximately correct. I know that Gazban's agent came from .amarah to Baghdad in the T, Khalifah fT and it is said that he sent a telegram to Gazban at Amarah to the following effect 'the garden 'question is settled. a thousaCnd Liras more are required which send by Ennis'. Snnis is Gazban's secretary a»d he came to Baghdad, it is said t&gt;^t Liras 1,000. It is reported that the Eakib is opposed to the Vali's proceedings as he considers them likely t© l®ad to bloodshed. 4. Subsequent events also lend colour to the story given above. O jl the 7th July I received information from the iitgent of theattack 9 a the British steamer iLhalifah as the result of the putrile 'behaviour of some silly Arabs of' ths innarah tribes.

When I reached iunarah I feunu. the KatsKxrif I'lutassarif and Ham id Pasha were not on speaking terms, and the latter had directed his staff to heve no dealings with the Civil efficials. Relations between the Vali and Hamid Pasha, who is powerfully protected and a man of progressive ideas, seemed also to be somewhat strained. Half of the land at ^marah belongs to the Sultan ana the other half belongs to ths State and is called lulkiye. Ihese lands are farmed out to the tribes on the muqata'a system/iTV.g, system sti c. -.iavGo. _ Gorx t 7 rsriusix . ox 1 'tGrinG o'f 'two ^ tlirGe , or ^iv© years, the farmer subletting them to hie tribesmen who cultivate them and provide the seed. The A1 hu T 'uhamr::8.d whose Sheikh is Seyhood are more numerous apparently than the £)eni Lam, who are under the rulership of uadban, and are said to pay almost twice the rental of the latter for lands farmed to them. The two tribes are etb constantly fighting with one another and their borders are contiguous in many places. They both farm lands on the east and west banks of the Tigris. She r atter which is at present occupying the attention of the authorities appear to be somewhat as follows. There is a certain district called Kuirey^djtelonging to the Saniye department situated on the west bank of the Tigris, which wes formerly leased to one Hatab, a son -in-law of Geyhood Sheikh of the Kl bu T'uhamc ad tribe. Hatsb married Pitna, daughter of Seyhood. He is a Sheikh of the a1 bu Daraj who dwells/ at Kumeyd and acknowledge the Sheikh of the kl bu Tuhammad as their overlord. About two years ago there wac constant fighting between the Kumeyd people and the j^ani xar who farmed lands near them. Tatters became serious, the general peace of the district was disturbed by the quarrel and troops were sent from .Baghdad to quell the disorders. The Seniye department decided to deprive Hatab of his lease which had not expired ana to relet t-ie ground to one Belassim brother of Gadban of the yam Lam. This ■■.e- bslrKBEn ikkg isxni L sk done on the ground of expadiency and to c ^vx. t. further/ /■«■ g further friction Detween the isani Lam and Al 'bu I ■uhairrrad, as the ill bu Daraj , the d^ellerc on the soil of iCmrieyd appear to follow either faction indifferently as one or the other gains the ascendency and becomes their overlord for the time being. The matter teing thus temporarily arranged the troops were withdrawn ?i'here'u.pon Gadhan apparently distrusting the Sheikh of Znmeyd seized Hatab and his four brothers and held them prisoners, imlassim's lease of Kiimieyd has nov/ exi^ired and the land is to be pux up for auction again. Hem id Pasha the President of the ^aniye has represented to the Palace that he can make a better fasEgin bargain with the ill bu ruhammad than with the Bani Lam and can put some 4000 Liras into the Sultan^ pocket by restoring the Kuri:eyd lands to Hatab. He seems to be somewhat influenced in this decision by Fitna , Hatab* a wife and daughter of 3eyhood, who anlthough already married four times and the fifth wife of her present husband, is not devoid of personal attractions or without coquetry and, having sot her cap at Hamid Pasha, is diligently running him in the interest of her imprisoned husband, a proceeding which bids fair to disturb the domestic tranquility of the President's own household and supplies food lor the scandal mongers of Amarah. Fitna herself nas twice applied to this Consulate for assistance but I considered it madvis ble ^o interfere and encourage her to submit her petition directly to trie Yali himself. The Tali, after due consideration of the matter on tne spot has, I am informed, come to the conc-iusion tnat to revert/ 5 7- ,) to the former arrangement and to establish Hatab in such close proximity to the Bani Lam would 'be inexpedient and dangerous and lead to further fighting between the tribes. To prevent this it xbu would be necessary to dispossess GJadban of the 1? nd he holds near Eumeyd and to remove him to some place further afield and such a step could only be taken xn in the presence of a large body of troop He has accordingly informed the ! inister of the Caniye department at Constantinople of his conclusions and stated that if 'lis Kiqc rajesty desires the extrfc. 4000 Liras a year and the transfer of trie land to the A1 bu T uliammad the necessary troops must be sent and the arrangement which cannot be eflected v/ithout bloodsned ..ill 00 carried out. Otherwise the lands should remain in possession of the .oani Lam and the ruestion will solve itse-i'.

The hereditary feud between the A1 bu T uhamr; ad and Bani Lam is quite inextinguishable and the only practical arrangement would be to place the river Tigris between the two factions and farm out lands to them on its ea-t .-nd ^e-t banks respectively thus creating a natural banie- .nich would act as a powerful deterrent by lesjening the opportunities c- tribal conflict.

Sir N. 0* Conor to Sir Edward Grey,—(Received June 18.) {No. 400. Confidential.) Sir, Therapia, June 11, 1906. With refererice to my despatches No. 292 of the 1st May and No. 809, Secret and Confidential, of the 8th May, relative to the defeat and death of ' Abdul Aziz Bin Hash id of Hail, I have the honour to transmit herewith copy of a despatch which I have received from Eis Majesty's Acting Consul at Jeddah, reporting the arrival of two messengers from' Bin Saoud ^with letters for the Grand Shereef of Mecca and the Yali of the Hedjaz. It would appear that after his successful encounter with the Emir of Nejd, Bin Saoud has proclaimed himself ruler of the whole 44 Shark ' (East), and has sent letters to Constantinople and to the Valis of Bussorah and Bngdad. As His Majesty's Acting Consul reports that the two messengers who had recently arrived at Jeddah had left for Yambo, and that the rumour is current that Bin Saoud has ordered them to proceed to Egypt with a letter addressed to the Khedive, I am forwarding a copy of the inclosure in this despatch to the Earl of Cromer. What importance is to be attached to Bin Saoud's communication cannot be estimated at present, but so far as his character is actually known, neither his military prowess nor his administrative capacity encourages the belief that he will be able successfully to cope with the Ottoman Government, should he decide to proclaim his independence of the Sultan. The development of the questionj however, deserves to be carefully watched. I have, &amp;c., (Signed) N. R. O'CONOR.Inclosure in No. 1. Acting Consul Hussein to Sir N, O'Conor. (No. 25.) Sir, Jeddah, May 13, 1906. I have the honour to report that on the 26ih ultimo a telegram was received by His Excellency Ahmed Ratib Pasha from Medina that Abdul Aziz Bin Eashid, with 250 followers, was killed in a fight with Bin Saoud. The news gradually filtered through, and on the 28th ultimo I cabled the news to Your Excellency. A few days later two messengers, bearing letters from Bin Saoud to His Highness tbe Grand Sheree'f and His Excellency the Vali, arrived here. I have not been able to see them personally, but the following appears to be the con tents'of the letters which is also corroborated by the news given out by these messengers to some respectable people of this town and Mecca. Towards the end of April, Abdul Aziz Bin Rashid moved from his country in a marauding mood, and went to plunder a caravan, consisting of men of Bin Saoud's tribe, which was coming to Nejd from Bagdad with quantities of mer chandize and supplies for the Turkish troops. He succeeded in waylaying the caravan and plundering it in a place not far from the camp of Bin Saoud. It appears that Bin Rashid, being in the country of Bin Saoud, was unaware of his whereabouts at the time, and did not think that Bin Saoud might be so close to the place of his depredations. Bin Rashid had a small following with him which was sufficient to plunder a caravan, but in no way capable to give battle to Bin Saoud. The Sheikh of the plundered caravan, who knew that Bin Saoud was close by, repaired at once to give him the news, and craved his help to recover the raided property, leaving behind him orders with his men to keep Bin Saoud fully informed of the movements of Bin Rashid. On receiving the news Bin Saoud lost no time in marching swiftly to attack Bin Rashid with a strong body of men, and overtook him next night while Bin Rashid and his men, loaded with their booty, were encamped in a small valley in a false but perfect sense of security against any attack from an enemy. A sudden charge of Bin Saoud created unmanageable confusion and panic in the sleeping camp of Bin Rashid, and most of his followers were in flight. But Bin Rashid, with whatever men stood by him, faced the attack, and in regular Arab style declared his presence and recited ' rajaz ' (verses of war). Bin Rashid's presence having been found out, a concentrated deadly fire was poured at him, and everything was over in a few minutes. Bin Rashid was found among the dead, and his head was cut off, and for six days paraded on a pole among the neighbouring tribes. It is reported that Bin Rashid's own son and one cousin were also killed, but the new T s is not confirmed. After this success Bin Saoud has declared himself the ruler of whole 'Shark,' and has sent letters to Constantinopole, to the Valis of Bussorah, Bagdad, Hedjaz, and His Highness the Grand Shereef. The messengers were well received here both by the Vali and the Grand Shereef, and were rewarded with Khilats in the usual way. The messengers have left for Yembo, and it is rumoured tbat they have orders to proceed to Egypt, and have a letter addressed to the Khedive. I have, &amp;c., (Signed) MOHAMMED HUSSEIN. P. S.—li is hardly believed here that 250 men were killed with Bin Eashid, as the fighting did net last more than a few minutes. 20 G. C. PresB, Siml a .-No. 636 F. D.-U-S-OO.-M-B. S.

We left Baghdad on the third of July 1906. It seemed to me that the Arahs are in an vmuauelly excited state between Koot and ^urna. 1 say this because when the steamer passes it is usual for boys to run alongside and ask for things to be thrown to them; on this voyage men run alongside, threw things at us, and generally showed an excited and unfriendly feeling. When we got below Ezra's Torab I sa% a crowd of about a hundred men, mostly armed, they said nothing to us: but I heard one man say 'shoot at hinf'. No shots v.ere however fired. We started back from Amarah on the 7th July, and at about noon on Sunday, the 6th July we reached a place about 15 miles below Amarah. Here there was a crowd of about 300 or 400 Arabs, mostly armed. They shouted out to us that they would let us pass t.iis time as they had sent an Ultimatum to the Turks, allowing a period of ten days, of which only eight had elapsed. They said that on our return journey they would make widowswidows of all our Uvss. They were also abusive^ At that time we had no flag flyir^. When ve got to Araarah we heard that the 'Burhaniyah' 1 had been fired at near the ^lace where ve had seen the Arabs, The story we heard was that 15 shots had been fired and that th shots had been returned from the 'Burhanlyah', with the result that one or two Arabs had been hit. The 'Burhaniyah' was about two days ahead of us. Roth on the up and down journey the only place where I sav- any troops other than those which are always on the river bank, was at Ezra's Torab. 1 saw about 2C or 30 soldiers there. (Sd) F. n.

From—His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Basrah, To—His Britannic Majesty's Ambassador, Constantinople. With reference to my despatch No. 59 of August 25th, I have the honour to report that I called on Lieutenant-General Sudqi Pasha last Wednesday. He had bi'en ordered to Baghdad and left the same evening. It is uncertain whether he will return to take up his appointment as Commandant at Basrah. Sudqi Pasha stated that he had handed over the Command in El Kasim to Sami Pasha, Acting Mutessarif and Commandant and stayed ten days with him after his arrival. Sami Pasha brought 500 soldiers and one gun with him from Medina. The troops arrived in excellent condition. According to Sudqi Pasha's account there are 2,500 troops in Nejd and El Kasim. The lines of communications are open and caravans arrive freely and, though supplies are not easily obtainable locally, all necessaries were for warded to them by caravans. Information from other sources does not confirm this favourable account. The tale told by the numerous deserters who have from time to time found their way to Koweit and thence the Basrah during Sudqi Pasha's command in Kasim is a very different one. They describe the state of the troops there as pitiable in the extreme and state that provisions are scarce and they are with out pay. Sudqi Pasha himself is said to be owed 2,000 Turkish for his services. Sudqi Pasha said that Ibn Saood was jealous of Saleh bin Mohanna's intercourse with the Turkish Officers and that he got the people of Boreyda to sign a mazhata complaining of his oppression and then removed him to Riadh. He attributes his removal to personal animosity. Though Mohanna was appointed Kaimakam of Boreyda by the Mushir, the appointment had not been confirmed by Constantinople. Sudqi Pasha marched from Boreyda to Zilfi and thence travelled by way of Es Safa and Subakeya to Koweit, crossing the northern end of the Dahna between Koweit and Kasim. From Zilfi onwards he found water once every four days. The journey was performed on camels. He brought^ 142 men with him and had no casualties. He seems to have travelled very quickly. He told me that peace had been established between Ibn Saood and Ibn Rashid but did not think it would last very long. He described Ibn Saood as a desert diplomatist and the late Abdul Aziz Bin Rashid as a desert warrior and said tne lormer displayed considerable ability and adroitness in his dealings while the latter was a fighting man pure and simple. Meta'ab his son is omy 21 and Sudqi Pasha thinks his youth will prevent him from taking any active line or the present, but his ambition to make a name for himself and follow in his at er s footsteps may lead to a recurrence of hostilities between the rival factions at no distant date. He stated the Arabs had now all retired to their homes ana their pastures.2 The murder of Abdul Aziz bin Jilwa, while on his way to Koweit with letter from Ibn Saood, was, I am informed, perpetrated by a raiding party of Shama Arabs who had not heard the news of peace being proclaimed. 1 learn that the allowance granted by the Turkish Government to Ibn Saooc is by recent arrangement paid through the Sheikh of Koweit, who deducts itfron the land tax due to the Government on his Fao property. Meta'ab's allowana is supposed to be paid through Baghdad, but I have not heard of his receiving anything as yet. I can obtain no confirmation of the report from Jeddah, mentioned in Youi ' Excellency's despatch of yth July, that Ibn Saood had ordered the Arab Sheikh; ^ and tribes in Nejd to abstain from communication with Turkish officers anc troops and to stop carrying their mails and supplies. Sudqi Pasha seems tc have been on very friendly terms with Ibn Saood who visited him several times during his recent visit to Boreyda and brought his retainers and many Arat Sheikhs with him. The troops have no doubt suffered from want of money anc though there was little or no fighting they must necessarily have endurec Copy forwarded to His Majesty's Resident and Consul-General, with the compliments of the undersigned. great hardships.

Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To-sm LOUIS W Dane, K C.l.E,, C.S .I., Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. 1 hcivc the honour to forward, for the consideration of Government, a copy Political Agent, Koweit, to Resident, No. 313, of the communication marginally quoted ditedtheasth August 190 \ ^ which I have received from' the Political Agent at Koweit, on the subject of the aspirations of Bin Saood to enter into closer relations with the British Government. 2, In the same connection, I have the honour to refer to paragraph 2 of my letter No. 64 of 23rd February last to your address. Subsequently when touring on the Arab Coast in May last I had an opportunity of meeting Sheikh Jasim bin Thani at his summer quarters at Lusail, and on that occasion he expressed himself to much the same effect on behalf of Bin Saood, saying that the latter was now strong enough to drive the Turks out of Nejd and A1 Hassa and asking whether in the event of his coming down to the coast, the British Government could not see their way to give him the same measure of protection by sea as they gave to Sheikh Mubarak and other Arab Chiefs on the Coast, in pursuance of their traditional policy of preserving the maritime peace of the Gulf. He added that it would be a simple matter for Bin Saood to meet a British officer at the coast, if that course were considered desirable. In reply, I told Sheikh Jasim that this was a question to which I could not give him any definite answer offhand and without instructions from the Govern ment of India. Just at that time the news of the death of Bin Rashid at the hands of his rival reached the coast and the situation seemed so kaleidoscopic that I delayed making any report to Government until matters had crystallised somewhat. I have now received from Captain Knox a communication from Sheikh Mubarak to much the same effect as the foregoing. We have thus been approached from three directions and I think there can be no doubt that these representations may be held to have been inspired by Bin Saood personally. 3. Bin F ashid's death at the hands of his rival had an important influence on the situation, and as the Government of Indi^ have been informed, the three cornered peace of which the possibility was indicated in paragraph 2 of my letter No. 620 of 18th March has lately taken shape. Whether it will endure on its own merits or whether the Turks will at once set themselves to undo it, it is impossible to prophesy, but seeing that the present Bin Rashid is a mere youth of 18, it is hardly likely that he will be able to make any serious stand against Bin Saood for some time to come. The juncture is consequently a convenient one for an examination and review of the political situation in Central Arabia and of our attitude towards Bin Saood and I venture to hope that Government will take advantage of it for that purpose. 4- While I believe I am right in thinking that His Majesty s Government regard with no favour the idea or the E A'L^hM^'.ToT' ,ele!!ran ' NO ' ' 48 ' Turks establishing themselves in Nejd,* I (2) Foreign Department letter No. 3397' E B ' am at the same time aware that it has atedfcth 0ctober 1904 * been a recognised principle of their policy not to allow themselves to become involved in the tempestuous politics of Central Arabia. Nevertheless it must be conceded that we have principles and interests to consider other than the pursuit of the purely negative doctrine ot aloofness above mentioned, and I cannot see that these are in any way serve y our carrying that doctrine to an extreme point and by our treating t e pre omi nant Arab element in Nejd with an active neglect which not only places us m anunnecessarily unfavourable position for safeguarding the other interests referred but which, persevered in, may be mistaken for hostility on our part and 0 engender a reciprocation of that sentiment on the pnrt of the Wahabi Chief 5. Thus it will be remembered that Bin Saood formally appealed to us for Ficte telegram Resident to Foreign Department, protection in a letter tO me daff^H n J May . 904 . May 1904, but no reply on behalf of Gov- ernment to that communication w^s ever authorised, and at the present ti no practical modus Vivendi between the Arab and ourselves can be said^ exist. 0 The inconvenience of this became apparent in connection with the intention altributed to Bin Saood of visiting Oman, which has created so much apprehen sion in the minds of the Pirate Coast Chiefs during the past year. Had th known that any sort of friendly understanding existed between the Residencv or Government and Bin Saood, both the Sultan of Muscat and the Trucial Chiefs would have been fortified with the consequent knowledge that any attempt on the part of the Wahabi to make a descent upon Oman would involve a prelimi nary rupture with us. In the absence of any such entente all we could do was to get Sheikh Mubarak to give him a hint that any such action on his part would be regarded with disfavour by us. It is true that it appeared afterwards that His Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople had expressed the opinion correspondence received with Foreign De- that We should deal With Bill Saood direct M^yT 06 endor&gt;ernent No 2020 ' E * B -' dated ,7th bul: meanwhile it had become necessary to take action locally in the most expeditious way open to us. As a matter of fact this course met with a very courteous res- Resider.t to Foreign Department No. 773, dated ponSC from Bin Saood as reported to Gnv. 5th April lso(5 - ernment at the time. | | 6. Another matter in regard to which we lose by not being on any sort of terms with the \\ ahabi is the question of piracy in the northern part of the Gulf. 1 here is good reason to suppose that, had we friendly relations with him Bin Saood would be able to give us considerable assistance in running down noto rieties like the outlaw Ahmed bin Salman, who yearly commits more or less serious depredations during the pearling season. 7. At the piesent epoch, as before mentioned, peace reigns in the land and if we have any mtention of establishing some measure of friendly intercourse with the Ruler of Nejd, the present seems to be the time for us to do so. If on the other hand we persevere in our policy of ignoring him altogether and leaving is appeals unanswered and if we allow the Turks to revive the strife in Central Arabia which theoretically they have now no excuse for doing, it will be small matter for wonder if we make him our bitter enemy for the future. I hesitate to make premature suggestions as to the terms which might figure in any agreement made, as I am aware that the problem is a delicate one and reqmres examination by a lens of longer focus than I can command, but I think 1 may say without temerity that I should welcome any degree of friendly understanding which would facilitate my dealings with the Trucial Chiefs and w ic wou ren er it possible and unobjectionable for our officers to make occa- siona ours in t e country and thereby to acquire accurate information regarding e opograp y n es and tribal politics of the interior, in respect of which our present store of knowledge is very meagre. vious'correspon^nce 0 :- 0 ^' 0 ' 3 ' ' SOl ' Cit reference t0 the following items of pre- (1) The latter part of letter No. 69, dated 26th March 1904, from the Oovermnent of India to the Secretary of State.

Dane, K.C .I .E., C.S .I V Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Simla, I have addressed you officially by this mail on the subject of our relations with Bin Saood, and the situation in Nejd. Would it not be possible, now that peace reigns for the time being, and Bin Saood has no active rival left in the field, to make more of the Status cjuo 5 argument as between ourselves and the Turks, in favour of an independent Nejd ? If we allow the Porte to go on pushing troops into Nejd with the intention of crushing Bin Saood and gradually advancing their outposts southwards, we shall surely regret it. I do not see how the Wahabi can go on opposing the Turks indefinitely, for where is he to get the money required for the struggle ; and unless we can devise some check on Turkish aggression now, it will be all the more difficult to apply a remedy later on. Diplomatic means are likely to be more efficacious in pre venting their ingress than ejecting them once they have got a footing. The cessation of strife among the Arabs themselves and the existence of this triple alliance, which Sheikh Mubarak intimates, seems to give us an ex cellent opening for telling the Turks that if they cannot let well alone and leave Nejd to its hereditary chiefs, we shall be obliged to take such measures in the interests of peace as our commercial stake on the Arab littoral and the effective suppression of piracy may seem to require. They themselves are impotent to do anything serious towards the maintenance of order and good government, and by continuing complacently to put up with their interference and aggression, we shall simply allow them to create for themselves prescriptive rights of occupation at one place after another, as we have done in the case of A1 Bidaa, Umm Kasr and Bubian. I am doubtful whether any agreement with Bin Saood, except as to matters which particularly concern us, such as the preservation of the maritime truce and friendly treatment of chiefs or principalities in treaty relation with us, would be expedient, as it might deprive the Wahabi of the power, if he should prove to have it, of expelling the Turks from Nejd and Hassa, but I hope the Govern ment of India will feel able to ask His Majesty's Government to take some steps to put the Nejd question on a more satisfactory basis.

I write to let you know that Mubarak was again talking about Nejd and repeating how anxious Bin Saood was for protection. He assured me that, whether helped by us or not. Bin Saood wouid certainly fight before submitting to the Turkish demands and that the people of Nejd would fight too. This is probably true as long as their .side is winning but Abdul Aziz bin Saood has many enemies who would of course turn against him without hesitation at the first reverse. ******** Extract from a news-letter, dated 26th September igo6, from Captain S. G» Knox, I.A., Political Agent, Koweit, to Major P. Z, Cox, C./.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf The following news has reached me with reference to the situation in Nejd and seems to me to have its own significance. The Turkish authorities are said to have addressed a letter to Meta'ab bin Rashid enquiring why he made peace with Abdul Aziz bin Saood and informing him that he had no authority to do so. The Fariq, who passed through Koweit the other day, is said to have addressed the people of El Kassim in the following terms :— ' I do not wish to offer you advice and I admit that the soldiers we have here are not sufficient to take El Kassim and that you are more^ numerous and as well armed as we are. But., if 500 of us are killed and we kill 200 of you, we can replace our 500, but whence will you replace your 200 ?

Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter of August 8, 1906. Sir H.0 f Conor to Sir 'S.Grey. Ho* 511. Therapia, July 25th 1906. Sir, With reference to ray despatch No. 490 of the 18th instant, I have the honour to report that I received on the 17th ultimo a telegram from His Majesty^ Consul at Basra informing me that two negroes who possess information ahout the Maaghil affair had been handed over to the Turkish autho- riti«« by the Skeikfe ©f Mohammera, but that he had not surrendered the persons who were alleged by the Turks to be implicated in the outrage although they had been arrested. I transmit herewith copy of a despatch from Mr.Mr* Cro w coniirniing 'tlie imfcrBia'tiGri conlisiined. in I iib telegram. It. would appear from the examination of the two surrendered negroes made by His Majesty's Consul at Mohanimera that they have received orders from the Sheikh to deny that any Maadan Arahs were implicated in the outrage; and Mr. Crow believes that both the Sheikh of Mohammerah and his deputy Mirza Hamza have special reasons for wishing to screen the three Mandan Arabs who have known to have taken refuge on Persian territory and are charged by the Turkish c authorities with direct complicity in the attack on Messrs L|tnc]a , s depot and the murder of Mr. Glanville. I have informed His Majesty 's Charge d / Affaires at Tehran that these Arabs have not been given up notwithstanding the orders to that effect sent from Tehran, and I have again pressed that in structions should be sent to Mohammerah for their immediate surrender. these circumstanees, I do not think that the delay which has occurred in bringing the culprits to justice can be attributed wholly to negligence or indifference on the part of the Turkish autLc. ias and I am instructing Mr. Crew by telegraph to proceed withi^Vi. m. with the trial of those already arrested. I trust that in view or the stringent inBtructione sent to Majid Bey, the Acting Vali of Basra, by the Grand Vizier, tke court martial will terminate its investigation witkout further delay. I have, e tc., Sd. H.R.O 1 Conor. Mr. Crow to Sir Conor. .1 British Consulate, Basra, Juno 28 th 1906. Sir, i With reference to my telegram Nc. 49 of June 16, I have the honour to report that a certain Mirjan and his brother alleged by the Sheikh of Mo ham mer ah to be connected *ith the preparators of the outrage at Maghil were handed over by him tc the Turkish authorities on June 14th. The Sheiich of Moham- merah caused these men to be examined in Mr. presence before leaving and Mr. Mc Doiiall sent me a copy of the notes taken by him of their examination. Their admission to which I referred in my despatch uAm) Mo. 35 of May 18, amountE to very little. Mirjan said he wae going with the gang before, but not during the attack, and that they were led by a negro whose wife was a servant at Lynch* s depot at Maghil. He gave the names of 13 persons who formed the gang two only of which correspond to those obtained by the Aviijis# e e tated that the plunder consisted of two breech-loading guns, a clock, some clothing and two or three liras; that some of the things were disposed of at Hawsyza and that no Ma 1 dan Arabs were connected in the attack. Mesheyil, brother of Mirjan, said that he knew nothing of the matter except that his brother ^as with the gang on the road but not at Maghil. I sent a translation of this statement to the Acting Vali for the information of the Court Martial. The prisoners were brought before the Court Martial on June 19th and examined in the presence of my dragoman. They both absolutely denied any knowledge whatever of the outrage at ^aghil or ©f the persons who committed it and stated that their admissions at Mohammerah were made under compulsion* Onat Basra. On the 26th of June they were again examined 'by the Court in trie presence of my dragoman and again denied all knowledge of the affair, adding that the story put into their mouths at Mohammerah was concocted entirely by the Sheikh himself^ I am inclined to think that the Sheikh of Mohammerah, like Mirza Haaiza, hie adjunct, wishes tc screen the three Ma* dan Arabs accused by the Turks of having taken part in the outrage, who have taken refuge ©n hie territory and who are to some extent hie dependents. Anxious at the same time to conform to hie instructions and make a show of help ing us he has arrested these two men, who are already fugitives from justice, and who have for some reason incurred his displeasure. He has been careful to make tlaem say that no Ma* dan are implicated and has put into their mouths what he considers a plausible story, having previously warned us that the prisoners would probably deny their statements on examination The private information obtained by Mr» Mc Donall and forwarded in nay despatch No. 40, of June 9th tends to show that the Ma 1 dan Arabs whom the Sheikh now protects were much compromised in theaffair, and I am Inclined to believe that cur ori ginal information, ae confirmed by the admission of Bahayeaii and the statement of Mr. Mc Donalds informant ie substatially correct and that the Sheikh of Moham- merah ie merely throwing duct in our eyee and screen ing the true offenders from justice. I see no likelihood of catching any more culprits and it would now perhaps 'be as well to urge for the immediate trial of those already arrested, as suggested in the last paragraph of Your Excellency's telegram of May 9th last.

A copy is also being forwarded to His Majesty's Consul, Basrah. 2. 1 take the opportunity to mention at the same time that I have since had an opportunity of discussing with Major Knox the subject of Sudgi Pasha's return from Nejd with 300 men vtd Koweit, which was reported in article 1039 of this Office Diary for the week ending 2nd September; and have the honour to invite consideration to an aspect of the incident which inevitably suggests itself. It will doubtless have been noticed that the Turkish Officer and his men were got out of the place by Sheikh Mubarak with all possible despatch and although Sheikh Mubarak and his subjects would probably be too proud to admit that their presence in Koweit caused any actual trepidation, it can hardly be doubted that the pulses of both one and the other were considerably quickened by the unwelcome visitation. On this occasion their arrival was fortuitous and their intentions were doubt less innocuous, but as a precedent the incident is a somewhat inconvenient one, for it is possible to conceive that the experiment might be repeated with a larger force from Nejd or Baghdad, and that having arrived by this means a Turkish force might for the time being easily possess themselves of the town and of Sheikh Mubarak ^2, coup de main similar to that which the Bedouins effected in Maskat in 1895. 3. I venture to draw attention to the possibility, in case it might be con sidered desirable for us to give Sheikh Mubarak any advice on the subject for future guidance, or to suggest to the Porte that the course taken in this case seems to us open to objection and calculated to disturb unnecessarily the minds of the Koweit public, including British subjects. If the Porte wants to put troops into Nejd, or get them out of Nejd, it is reasonable to argue that they should use Ojair for the purpose and not the territory of a neutral Chief.

In reply, I have the honour to inform you that Sheikh Mubarak informs roe that the allowances are fixed as follows :— For Abdur Rahman bin Feysul bin Saood, Turkish £ go per mensem. For Meta'ab bin Rashid, 200 tigars rice per annum and Turkish ^200 per roensem.7 2 In addition to the above^ Meta 'ab s predecessors used to receive presents of arms and ammunition. ^ Sheikh Mubarak says that the allowances to Bin Rashid are paid through the Baghdad authorities, and that Yusuf Pasha bin Mandil, a Basrah merchant, draws the Saood allowances from the Basrah authorities and remits them by cheque to Abdulla Nafisi, a Koweit shopkeeper, who hands the money to Bin Saood's emissaries. 4. At the same time, enquiries I have made in another direction confirm His Britannic Majesty's Consul's statement that the allowances are paid through Sheikh Mubarak in the way indicated but, at the same time, my informant said that there was no regular channel and that the payments were made in whatever manner was most convenient. 5. While I was discussing this matter with Sheikh Mubarak, he suddenly turned to me and said ' You have been asking me about bin Rashid s and Bin Saood's pay, but you don't ask me any question about my pay ? ' 1 said ' Surely, you don't draw any pay ?'. He replied 'No, I do not, but the Turkish authorities at Basrah are for ever pressing me to accept it. Instead of that, I pay them and when they ask me for Turkish ^'200, I send them T. £600. I told them in reply to their insistence that the receipt of pay from the Turkish Government had ceased to be a source of honour and had, therefore, no longer any attractions for me and that, thanks be to God !

Ibe latter s remarks in behalf of Bin Saood's cause, as reported in para graph 5 of Captain Knox s letter, are a repetition of his former representations, but his subsequent observations regarding the Baghdad Railway question, are of much interest as evidence of the astute concern which he takes in the political situation, and, at the same time, seem to me to bear out the view which I have all along maintained that, in spite of the coquetry with the Turks in which the force of circumstance obliges him periodically to indulge, Sheikh Mubarak has at bottom a genuine conviction that his salvation lies in close adherence to the Christian Power, at present Great Britain, which occupies a predominant position in the northern portion of the Gulf.

I have the honour to inform you that I have just returned this morning from a visit to Sheikh Mobarak at which he gave me the following news from Nejd. 2. He said that he had received letters from Bin Saood and from Bin Bashid, and that the former had told him tbat the Mutessarif with 1 ,200 men (Syrian troops) and 12 guns had h ft for Medina on the 15th Ramzan=3rd instant, and that on the first day of Shawal=19th instant, the Amir-ul-Alai (Commandant) with 1,100 Iraq men and 3 guns would return to Iraq. 3. Bin Saood also said that the Turkish authorities were very anxious to leave 200 men in El Kasim, of whom 100 men should remain in Boraida and 100 in Anaiza, To this, however, he and tl&gt;e headmen of El Kasim refused to consent, and eventually it was agreed that small detachments only should remain, viz.y 25 men in Boraida and 15 in Anaiza. 4. Bin Saood also said that he holds a paper signed by 80 Turkish Officers to say that they have found Bin Saood a loyal servant of His Impenal ajes y the Sultan, who has helped them to all they needed as far as possible ; that Nejd is a poor country with an abominable climate, bad water and no supp les which can support Turkish troops. 5. Sheikh Mubarak ended this lengthy recital with comments on the affairs of A1 Hassa which he said were in a very bad way, and su §| es ^ that it would be an excellent thing if Bin Saood were to take A1 Hassa and Katif, his ancestral property, and that he would then app y or protection of His Majesty's Government. 6 To this I replied that I could make on this proposal no comment whatever^ but that, as the Sheiu h probably was perfectly well aware, all communications that he made to me weie promp ^ f • &lt; &lt; • ^ transmission to higher authority who would sem S \ f i i. views such thought fit and that it was idle for me to speculate as to wha. authority would take.2 7. The Sheikh then mentioned that a large number of people at Kerbala had applied to His Britannic Majesty's Consul-General at Baghdad for protection, and that the Muntafik country round Amara between the two Vilayets of Baghdad and Basrah was full of revolt, and that the railway would never reach the sea nor be prosperous unless it was in British control from Baghdad to the sea, and that the Sultan could draw the profit of it. He said that the Germans had been playing with the Porte, and remarked that it was England and her warships that had saved Constantinople at the close of the last Russo-Turkish War. 8. The Sheikh told me that he had no exact information as to the Turkish casualties, in Al Hassa, but that the Ajman declared that they had destroyed two troops and taken away their arms, and that more than half the Al Hassa garrison had been killed. He said that undoubtedly Fahad bin Hithlain, the Ajman Chief, now in Koweit, had captured a gun and had brought in two mules and many donkeys for sale in Koweit and would send in more. 9. Pahad bin Hithlain came to see me on the 19th instant, and with him an old and influential Sheikh of the Ajman, named Salim bin Muhammad of the Al Hadi Section. The Chief is a fine handsome young man of about 80 years of age. He looked lazy and goodnatured and talked but little, but he gave one the impression that he would be a leader of men, fierce and vindictive, if he were roused to action. 10. These two both exaggerated Sheikh Mubarak's account of their^ victory and said that the El Hassa townsmen with the soldiers had now tasted their vengeance and were ready to agree to any terms. They had offered to write off all claims for blood-shed and to pay up all arrears of allowances due to the Ajman Sheikhs, and especially sued that they might redeem the gun (offering for it T.£2,000) and to pay double prices for all arms and mules. Fahad refused to sell the gun, saying that he would send it either to Mubarak or to Bin Saood. The two Chiefs offered me a warm welcome if I came into their country, which begins about three days south of Koweit. 11. The Turkish withdrawal from Nejd, coupled with the news from Al Hassa, appears to have had an effect, very unfortunate for them, on public opinion in these parts and one might hazard the assertion that Sheikh Mubarak knows more than he told me about possible complications in Al Hassa and the Muntafik country.

A letter from Hassa dated Oct.29 1322 ( Nov. 12 1906 ) , received here oy Mahmoud Bey Tabour Agassi of Hassa^states thattwenty days ago the town of Hassa was surrounded day and night by Arabs of the El A^man and other Bedouin tribes in co&amp;sequenoe of the murder of Abdullah Bin ja'^er a merchant of Hassa . The townsmen fled , 8000 men of Hassa, 600 infan try and 200 mounted men united and attacked the tribes. During the engagement which followed 2 lieutenants and 72 infantry were killed and 57 men woundea on the Turkish side and 85 mules, 125 rifles and one gun were captured by tne Arabs. A village named Shigegg, belonging to the Senlye Dep- -artment, situated about two hours from Hassa was plundered and burnt by the tribes and many villagers were killed and wounded. In the Hakamiye garden 4 soldiers were killed and 2 sergeants of the gendarmerie wounded and 16 rifles were oap -tured. The inhabitants of other villages gave money ana dates to the Arabs to leave them alone and so esoaf* *•The tribes then made peace with the people of Hassa and on receiving 700 rials ( £70 ) restored the captured gun.

Acrording to what is 1 believe the official account the Turkish troops are returning to Baghdad from Kasim. The unofficial account which has reached me is somewhat different. The story 3 as told to me,by a man who has fairly good sources of information, is as follows:- Ibn Sa'ud wrote from Fiadh to the Ajman,Beni Khalid, Beni Hajir and Manasir tribes to turn the Turkish troops out of El Has-a. The Arabs summoned the Turkish troops and told them they must either fight for their existence or leave the country,as the Sultan's troops had no business in El Hassa,which did not belong to him. A fight took place in which 85 Turkish officers and soldiers were killed,and 200 wounded. The troops were forced to give up their arms and ammunition, and to leave the country via Medina. As regards Kassim the same informant tells me the follow- -ing story:- Ibn Sa'ud wrote to the Mutair and UtaibU-tribes to fight Sami Pasha or remove him and his troops from Kasim. Ihe tro ps elected to go and (after giving up their arms ana guns; ) -they went towards Medina. It is said that 1700 men recruited m Irak have been lost.

I therefore asked his Excel lency to take stringent measures for the arrest of the culprits so that the court- martial could do its work. I also remarked that I had received trustworthy information that the majority of the suspected persons were still on Ottoman territory. I then described to His Excellency in some detail the attack on the British- Indian's house as witnessed by Europeans from the neighbouring roofs, and I laid some stress on the fact that the attack occurred in the European quarter, near the Consulate, and that I myself had been roused by the shooting and alarm. I pointed out that the patrol, some soldiers, and the marine guard at the arsenal were all present, and neither rendered assistance nor attempted to catch the thieves ; that one of the offenders had been subsequently recognized by Joseph Pollock, that he was a sapper in the Imperial army, and that, in spite of my representations, his immediate superior, a captain in the artillery, continued to prevent his arrest. I pressed for his immediate imprisonment. His Excellency replied that he had cognizance of the matter, and would give it his attention. 1 have since learnt that the man has been given up and imprisoned. I then suggested that I should give his Excellency a written statement of our complaints, to enable him to examine and settle them, and I again im pressed upon him the necessity of remedying the inefficiency of the police, as it was hopeless to expect the local authorities to do their duty as long as the police systematically evaded orders and connived at the escape of criminals. His Excellency promised to consider the question and to attend to our require ments. I then touched on the disturbances at Amara, and urged on his Excellency the necessity of protecting our steamers from interference on the river. I remarked that Gadban fired on them with the object of eliciting our interfer ence, and in order to put pressure on the Ottoman Government. The Vali replied that, if that were the case, he had not gained much, as the land in dis pute had been given neither to Gadban nor to Seyhood, but to an independent party. According to my information, this statement is false, as the Vali's dealings with Gadban are notorious, and the lessee of Kumeid is stated to be a mere nominee of Gadban's, who paid Medjid Bey over 4,000 liras to keep the land out of Seyhood's hands. I said, however, that I was glad to hear he had found a satisfactory conclusion, and I hoped that it would last ; but as the attack on the ' Khalifeh ' occurred on Gadban's land he was primarily responsible for it, and ought to be punished, and I asked His Excellency whether he proposed to take any steps to call him to account for it. The Vali replied that it was not easy to fix the blame or to find the actual aggressors. I said I did not see the necessity of that, but 1 thought, on public grounds alone, that the Arab Chief, in whose district the attack occurred, should be held personally res ponsible. Was the Ottoman Government with its troops and its administrative resources unable to keep the Arabs in order, or to punish a man in Gadban's position ? His Excellency replied that it could no doubt be done, but it was a wild country, and the Arabs a wild people. He seemed disinclined to move in the matter ; and in view of my information regarding the line he had taken, I thought it useless to pursue the subject. His Excellency stated that he thought it was a great mistake ever to have separated the Vilayets of Bagdad and Bussorah. I told him I could not agree with him. Bussorah was an important commercial centre, and its affairs could not be administered properly without a resident Vali. I said he ought to he a civilian with some knowledge of trade requirements, to which he agreed, and added that the local military authority ought to be directly subject to his orders. I forwarded to the Vali yesterday three Memoranda, dealing with:— («) The Maghil case ; (b) The attack on the British-Indian's house ; and (c) The theft of property still unrecovered from the premises of my dragoman's brother-in-law, of which 131 liras belonged to my dragoman, Naoum Abbo, 6 .'■pi2&amp;X&gt; The Vali returned my visit to-day, and in the course of conversation stated that exaggerated reports about the disturbances on the river had been stmt to Constantinople. He said the Porte had telegraphed that the 'Medjidie' was lost, trade interrupted, and sailing-vessels were being attacked and plunder ed on the river. I replied that grave fears had been entertained for the safety of the i( Medjidie, as she left at a disturbed time, and no timely news of her arrival at Amara could be obtained, owing to the telegraph lines having been cut. Steps had, however, been taken in time to check the disorders, and she reached her destination safely. I said : ' Sailing craft had undoubtedly been attacked.' He replied : f$ Perhaps some time ago, but not recently.' I said: ' Not very long ago/' and the result has been that the Nakhodas were scared and afraid to proceed, and had detained their ships at different points of the river. Some sixty to eighty with grain and liquorice had waited a long time at Amara. As long as merchants could not get grain from up-river, owing to tlie unrest, they were prevented from loading their ships and could not fulfil their contracts. Under these conditions, trade was certainly interrupted. Now, however, owing to the steps taken, and the assurances given, the evil had been removed and the situation bad temporarily improved. Sailing-vessels were coming down freely with guards on boards, I said I hoped the improvement would continue, and the Vali laughed. He gave me no further assurance on the subject, but asked the date of the arrival and departure of the 'Medjidie ' this week. I think he is alive to the necessity of taking steps to preserve order. He has evidently received his instructions. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) F. E. CROW. p, s.—J uly 19, 1905.—On the 19th instant the Vali wrote me an urgent letter to the effect that the Grand Vizier, at the instance of the Embassy, was asking about an attack alleged to have been made on two English steamers. His Excellency asked me to inform him at once of the names of the steamers, and to state where, how, and by whom they had been attacked. in order that he might arrest and punish the aggressors. I wrote in reply to say that the British vessels attacked were the ' Medjidie ' and the ' Khalifeh. That on the night of the 12th May the ' Medjidie ' was surrounded by 100 Arabs. and her progress impeded about 15 miles below Ezra's tomb. As for the 'Khalifeh as his Excellency was aware, and has had been stated in my letter No. 7o or the 16th June to the Vilayet, the attack on that vessel occurred on the dOth lay near Nehr Ariz, that the author of these attacks was Gadban, Sheikh ot the Beni-Lam, and that no further attacks on British vessels had been reported tome since.

He was appointed by the townsmen of Anaiza while Khalid bin Abdulla of Boraida is a nominee of Bin Saood. It appears, according to Misfir, that no Turkish representative of standing has been left in either of the towns and that the soldiers are under the orders of the two Amirs.

In the same connection, I beg to attach extracts from recent news- Politioal Agent, Bahrein, to Resident, No. 545, letters from the Political Agents at Koweit dated 16th December 1906. and Bahrein, for the information of the Political Agent, Koweit, to Resident, dated Government of India. 23rd December 1906. In the particular case mentioned by Captain Prideaux, on receiving his letter I took steps forthwith to find out from Basrah what foundation there was for the report current at Bahrein and to ascertain the probable movements of the S.S. Scott which had been chartered to convey the troops; and as she ended in proceeding direct to Katif, it was not necessary to trouble Government with a reference; but in regard to the general question involved, I share Captain Prideaux's opinion, and in view of 'the fact recently reported, that the Porte has issued instructions to the local officials at Basrah to treat Koweit and Bahrein as integral portions of the Ottoman Empire, I shall be glad to be favoured with the views of Government on the subject. No. 545, dated the 16th December 1906» From— Captain F. B. Peideaux , LA.., Political Ag-ent, Bahrein, To— Majoe P. Z. Cox , C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have just heard that a Turkish transport is expected here in two or three days' time, and that it is proposed to land the troops here for conveyance in sailing boats to tbeir destinations—Katif, Ojair and Doha, or perhaps only one or two of these places. In any case, it is believed that the steamer will not go to any of the mainland ports herself. I hear also that she will fire two guns on her arrival here, whether as a salute to the Sheikh or to let Katif know of her arrival, I cannot say. This procedure (landing the troops) it seems to me is only justifiable when the port is a component part of the Turkish Empire, and would not be tolerated in any other circumstances except after special diplomatic correspond ence and the obtaining of the Ruler's permission. It is not likely that the Turks will formally apply to Sheikh Esa for sanction, nor will it be regular for him to accord it direct. It seems to me that the' landing of a considerable body from a troopship is very different to booking small parties by the ordinary mail-steamer and allowing them to tranship here. Dated the 23rd December 1906. From—M ajor S. G. Knox , I.A., Political Agent, Koweit, To— Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Buehire. A Turkish soldier or hanger on turned up yesterday at my camp. He is one of a large body that passed not very far from ns and we have seen other stragglers. It appears that a body of ahont 1,000 is moving down from Nejd, and f hear that Sheikh Mubarak, who is in camp at Jehra, has sent men out to divert them in his direction and not to allow them to enter the town. My friend, who has come to my camp, tells me that the larger party of troops weretw who returned to Medina and that it is the smaller division who are those who retu S avs that the Baghdad force was originally much returning to Baghdad^ He y ^ kil i cd in battle, 2,000 died of 'disease and sttvation 7 He himself, though he looks healthy and well fed was in a pretty deplorable state of destitution. He has no boots or shoes and only one garment—a coarse brown overcoat very tattered. One leg was todlv swoUen and the other foot had donhle blisters. I operated and dressed his Misters and am giving him food and lodging until we leave, but two davs rest will probably set him up and fit him to get to Koweit. I f G. I. c; p. 0.—No. 8968 P.
