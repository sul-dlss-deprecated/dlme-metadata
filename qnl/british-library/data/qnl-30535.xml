Messrs Hoodbhoy &amp; Bros, the local B.I.Agent, have received orders from their principal agents at Bombay that they must accept whatever currency is offered to them for freight and passages. The present arrange ment therefore is that the local agent will pay the Commanders of all the B.I.S.N ships aiy^ advance for disbursements in Pakistan currency until such time as their present bulk of this currency has finished. This money will then be exchanged with the bankers of Messrs Mackinnon Mackenzie, Bombay.

The reason for their visit here is not known and between the hours of sun up and sun down no cargo was seen to have been loaded or unloaded, but it can be presumed that they must have been engaged in some smuggling racket. Their arrival and departure was under cover of darkness. The Weather. 193* Winter has set in properly and lovely weather is being enjoyed here. For the last few days it has been cloudy and on the 2nd. a very fine drizzle began which lasted a few minutes only. The local inhabitants, as usual, say that this is a sign of rain this winter.

The occasion of 'Devali' was celebrated very quietly and privately by all the Hindu community in Gwadur. During the day they performed their usual 'pooja' and prayers, and in the evening a party was thrown to special invited guests from the Khoja and Baluch communities. The Wali and British Agent were invited at 8 p.m., both attended. 18A. The Sub Postmaster, Gwadur, Mr. Mohd Din, has been suffering from otiti externa for a long time which was neglected due to there being no medical facilities in Gwadur. The Sanitary Inspector, who is a certified public vaccinator, administered treatment which aggrivated the ear considerably. The postmaster has cabled his head office at Karachi to make arrangements for his immediate relief so that proper medical attention can be obtained at Karachi. Nothing has so far been done and his ear is becoming worse. He consulted the Ships Surgeon who stated that he feared mastoiditis, which is a far more serious condition where an operation would be necessary. Prom the above situation one can see that the need for a medical officer in Gwadur is most essential. The Muscat Government is advertising again in the Karachi papers 'Dawn' and 'Civil &amp; Military Gazette' for a doctor, but the pay offer ed, Rs. 600/-, is not very attractive. An ordinary practitioner can earn four times that amount in Karachi, hence they are not interested in the job. * Commu n ication s. 1 1 85 .

She left with 32 bales goathair for Karachi and five passengers. She refused to take on more passengers here as she was to pick up more cargo and about 300 passen gers at Pasni. I believe this launch is licenced to carry upto 170 passen gers only, but when asked why he was going to carry this excess, the Captain replied that 'Oh, nobody ever questions these things at Karachi'. 173. Haji Mohd Bhatti, J.P., proprietor of the Muslim Navigation Company arrived from Jiwani on the 14di evening. He was accompanied by about six other men, one of whom was believed to be Polish nationality and a business man. They did not report to this Agency during their brief stay here, and returned to Karachi on the 5th morning by an Arab launch. It is learnt that the purpose for their visit to Jiwani was to take up the contract with the Pakistan Government, Civil Aviation Department, for road building etc at Jiwani. 174.

She left with the above party for Karachi on the 5 th. Local News. 175. It is reliably learnt that steps are being taken by the Government of Pakistan to construct a road from Pasni to Jiwani. This was more or less confirmed by Haji Mohd Bhatti when he mentioned that he v.as hoping to get the contract for this. It is interesting to see what effect this might have on the caravan trade with Gwadur from Mekran and Iran. Eventually, a road might even be constructed connecting Pasni with Karachi via Ormara, Bela etc, 1 76 . At 19.30 hrs on the 4th. a slight earthquake tremor was experienced in Gwadur which lasted about two seconds. The general direction appeared to have been from S.East to N.West; no damage was done. Before anyone could become aware of it, it had passed off as the tremor was very slight. Communications. 1 77.

The present rate of the free sugar is about Rs.7/8 per five seers (a Gwadur maund). This controlled sugar has not been released for sale yet. 1 66 . Some five or six large sea going dhows have arrived and left Gwadur during the period under review. They have neither landed nor taken on any cargo from here. They most probably called in here for rations etc to take with them, and perhaps a rest also. One of these dhows is believed to have come all the way from Zanzibar and was on her way to Cutch Mandvi, India. 167. The M.L. 'Majidiya' arrived from Karachi on the 10th with 40 passengers only. She returned to Karachi on the 14th with no passengers or cargo. She was carrying gold bars worth from between 14 to 15 lakhs, which by now must have been smuggled into Karachi.

Mr. Khan, designated as the Assistant Aerodrome Officer, will be in charge of the station. Mr. Khan, who arrived from Jiwani on the 16th by jeep, called on the British Agent on the 17th and said that Jiwani will be used merely as a 'check point' station for passing aircraft who might require information regarding weather etc, though arrangements are being made to take in any aircraft in case of an emergency.

The reason for the shortage of ‘Pridian currency is possibly due to trade with Ceylon by shipping fish there, the money received is in Indian currency and sent to an Agent at Kuwait who then exchanges it for Pakistan currency and sends it down to Gwadur.

Recently a sum of T 's.23,0C0/- ' rr as sent to Kuwait in the same way, which was then exchanged for Ks, 25^00/- Pakistan currency, and was received here in cash by Messrs Rhentullah Bashir.

Gwadur experienced her first ’sprinkle * of rain on the 29th. morning for about ten minutes only. Heavy clouds still prevail but no rain. This will be the fourth year that G-wadur has had no rainfall and a scarcity of sweet drinking water might be feared. In Sur the price of water has reduced to four annas per tin, but this is not because of the adequate supply, it is because of the fact that most of the fishermen come to Gwadur during the monsoons, as it is difficult to launch their boats and to bring them back on to the shore because of the high breakers there* hence the consumption of water at Sur is less during these months. The weather at Gwadur lias coolea down considerably since the South winds have started, though at nights it becomes hot and sticky. Finance. 1 1 27. For the past month or so there has been a acute shortage of small currency, such as one rupee notes, and coins; but recently the ten and five rupee notes have been included.

A ra.dio announement^from Padio Pakistan on the night of the 25 th. to the following effect.^/A few months back Mr. ''Ohsin Ali, Chief Engineering authority to the Pakistan Government, suggested to his government that he proposed to start a Hydro-Electric scheme between Pasni and Jiwani but that it would be im possible to make a start because pf Gwadur, which belongs to Muscat, lies bet ween these two ports. The outcome of this was a meeting held by Nawab Bhai Khan, ruler of Makran, which resulted in the meeting suggesting to the Pakistan Govern ment to put forward proposals to the Sultan of Kusaat for Gwadur. The announce ment concluded that 'we shall get Gwadur as soon as possibleOn the 2Gth. a person arrived from Pasni bearing the news that there were 5-9 men armed at Pasni who are awaiting orders to attack Gwadur, This gave the Wali cause for anxiety and he consulted the Administrator who told him there vas no need for panic anxiety, but the ^ali insisted on the two existing '^orts being manned by his Askars as a precautionary measure. Both the Administrator and the British Agent are trying to find out what effect all this has had on the public; whether they are in favour of Pakistan taking over or whether they will stand for the present Government. Most probably Pakistan wants to create panic here and then try to win the people over. The British Agent is keeping a careful eye on the TT indu community who sore in the minority in Gwadur. It is a known fact that the ’ merchants do not want Pakistan to take over as their business will be ruined by taxes etc. . 68 . Caravans from the interiorAhve practically stopped coning to Gwadur. Mekran Levies have been posted at Karwat, Suntsar, Thalang and one on the road between Jiwani and Pishkan, to stop all caravans coming in and out of Gwadur. Little or no business has been done in the local 'galag* (auction square) for the past week. Communications. * 1 69 . A complaint was lodged v-ith the British Agent by the local merchants to the 1 effect that they had sent registered letters from here to India containing important documents such as hundis (drafts' etc., and that they had received telegrams from their agents in India infer ing them that on opening these letters they found only blank papers. The British Agent lias, however, taken the matter up with the local post office, which is under the management of the Government of Pakistan. This is the first complaint of this nature to be made in Gwadur. 70.
