This attitude is a great change from thtt originally adopted, n he, &amp; his o; whe jrother Abdur Rahman^ endeJ voured to obt? in his^retum by threats of the action Bin 3aud would t' ice etc. I am inclined to think that, in view of thi fret that Bin Seud triad hia bsst to g.t him b! ok &amp; failed, little harm would b« likely to reault if he were now allowed to return, *3 an act of graoe^on the clear understanding that t '.o will at once lesva Bahrain should he be called upon to do so,by re- son a: A, his behaviour being unsatisf.^ctory # OrAbdul Aziz might be made to str nd ^as guarantor for his good behaviour.

I learrn th^t Ibriim bin Khalid recently turned up at Oj^ir,intending to go to Bin Saud,but was stopped A turned back. If this is correct, t would seem that H.T.I.G- r s recent threat to tho Sultan in which it was mentioned that his attitude regarding Bahrain affairs was not satisfactory, has not been without' godd effect. The disposal of the Dowasir property in Bahrain v . 3 delayed owing to the recent Sitrah outrage.lt is however for many reasoi, important that it should now take place as soon as possible,^ as soon// as levies have been startad which will enable us to c?onsiderrbly strengthen the present irregular post at Budniyeh pending placing a post of levies there,to protect the new inh^bitahts.It is part cularly desirable to settle Budaiyeh before next pearling seasan.as it is much sought after ps a pearling centre &amp; there v ould be no difficulty in finding settlers. The Djwaair,recently went to see Bin ^tud &amp; on their return put up ell their flags at Dhamaain announced that thty had received mueh pecuniary assit^nne A arras from Bin Saud f who had promisee thr t their property in B { hr^ in should not be disposed of &amp; that he would regain it for tham. This has been most cj re fully spread about % | doubtless with the object of frightening jhaik Hamad. T would suggest if you concur that Bin 3aud should now be written to &amp; his attention be drawn to tho rumours spread by the Dowcsir ( it might be said thut re doubt whether such stories hr.ve his up^roval, since if they hrid.his attitude dgksc in encour ging such people c ould only be construed as unfriendly to Bahrain A lacking in consideration for the wishes of H.M.Gr.) and informing him that the Dow'sir vere warned biif^re they left t which they did of thoir own accord,that their property woulct be confisc ted &amp; dispose! of &amp; this will now take place,-^ that it is a matter which sololy concerns the Bahrr in GrOverr.ment &amp; H.M.Gr. At the same time it might be pointed out that as he has allowed them to settle in his country,he must be responsible for thsir good behaviour &amp; if he cannot control them where they nov. ? re he would do well to remove them from Dhamam to Jubailm. ( I have every reason to believe that he would ^ like to get them there). I believe th' t such a letter now would make it practically impossible for Bin &gt;aud to make any fuss about the Dowt sir because he must answer &amp; if ho puts in any claim on their behalf wo can at once turn it down 4 if he admits the situation we can spread the news rbout &amp; discredit the Dowasir rumours.

Britioh Feaiuency and Coneulate-Ccneral, iushlre, S2nd cbruary 1924. „f. 1° Mr, I h»ve the honour to Imrite a reference to the correspondence ending with your telegram dated 4th February regarding the threatening attitude of the Doimsir ribe at Bhammam on the return from Riyadh of the deputation which they had sent to Hie Highness the rultan of I»oJd. 2. Cn he ^Ist of January* as re ^or ed in my telegram of that date 9 1 heard that the deputation had relumed and that the tribe hud hoisted their war flags at Dhammara and had noised abroad that Bin Saud had told their deputation that he would not allow their property in Bahrain to be sold and would see that they re turned to their Tillage shortly, also given out that they intended to raid Bahrain. In the same telegram as he reiOrted this the J olitioal Agent mentioned that he wireless station was to be closed for t repairs for ten days from the 1st February. In had not previously been informed of this ty the Indo-^uro^ean ole ograph Department, and it might have oaused considerable inconvenience to be completely out off from Bahrain a. that particular moment. Fortunately II.M.S. ,, Crooue n was in i&gt;ort a«ai ting he Hight lion'ble J.

W. 1.2 awaiting hotmail# before proceeding down the coaat, so 2 was able to aeic the Cozaraander if he oould proceed a I once to Jiahrain both to act ae a deterrent to the Poweair and to enable communication to be kept up with the olitlcal Agent. Commander wileon waa fortunately in a position to proceed at once, being hie own master aa H.M.S. w Crocutt ,, happened to be the only ship in the C;ul|tf at the motnenU He accord- -ingly left on Slat January and arriTed early let February. Xhammatfi being only f|uite a short distance off the Bahrain Islands, H.K.P.^Crocus' could not have repelled a sudden raid on the* north-west comer of the main Island where Budaiya is situated but he^resence did act as a deterrent, and on hearing of her arrival, the Bow*air evidently seeing that the Britiah Kavy was on the qui-vivc a? framed a quieter demeanour, and did not atteppi to raid. Accordingly everything having been quiet for more than a week and the wireless station repaired, H.&amp;US.'Crocua* 1 left Jbahrain on the 9th February. &lt;S. After receiving in your above mentioned telegram authority to write to Bin ' aud about the matter, I consulted the Political Agent ae to the advisability of doing so, and at first decided not to do so in case it should only irritate Bin : aud. But later on having hoard from ^iajor laiy that Hia Highnesa had behaved veil in refusing to allow Shaikh Ibrahim bin Khalid, a nephew of Shaikh lea, concerned in the recent outrage at Bitrah, to enter his territory and in having him turned back from Cjair, and was in other matters assuming, a less interfering attitude, I decided to send the letter in the hope,that it would give His Highness the im- -pulse required to make him refuse further assistance to the Dowasir. I accordingly wrote a latter dated 14th February onon t&amp;o Xlnee mentioned In my telegram Ho* 10 da ed Slat January t and annex a copy of the nullah vcrclon of it for your Infomatlon. I hope It will recult In Bin raud removing the Dovaair to Jubail or its neighbourhood, which will get them out of eaey raiding dietanoe from Hahrain. X know that Bin aud originally wimted to eettle the tribe there but they objected to going eo far afield t firstly because hey would be too completely in hie power and feared hie tyranny and oppreeeion which are notorious, and secondly because whey hoped o be able from HJuuEmm Dhammam to inti idate the Chaikh Of Bahrain and to be in a position to return to Budaiya or not as it pleased them. hey have probably found out their mistake on ^he eecond opinion and it is to be hoped that they will be given an opportunity to find themselves ri^bt in the first. 4. It certainly seems to be the fact that the Sultan is assuming a less truculent attitude in regard to Bahrain affairs, and I think hie may be accounted for by the fact that he does not fe^l himself so strong as he did. Numerous reports are heard in Baghdad, Kuwait and other places that His Kighn^ss* pother is on the wans and 1 append for your information a copy of a memorandum on this subject from the olitical Agent; # Kuwait, una of another from the olitica3 Af en t, Bahrain, on the same subject, for which I asked on receipt of the first. t.

The appeal to the 3hara' haa always been the last resort of the Dowasir.ffhenever they have been taken to task for misdeeds they have invariably offered to submit to Share' decision, which in the case of so povarful a oody,. . u hey vara when in Bahrain,always meant that they escaped soqc all punishment. is regards tha re-settlement of Budaiyah,perhaps it would be as well to await tha arrival of tha levies,whan a strong post could be placed there to adequately protect the new settlers,who will probably be oh44hs,froia possible molestation.

Shaik Harmed agreed that this v as the r thin end of the wedge 1 &amp; informed Ibrahim bin Abdul Latif that the matter was closed Sa would not be further considered.

Apart from e cert 1 in amount of intrigue &amp; propaganda by persons of the Abdul !

The return ? of the Dowasir would reverse all this &amp; m- ke mf tters - x rob f bly v orse th n before. I prasume tharnfore th- t I may reply to any - pprorohes which muy be maSs to me,that H.M.S. will not be prap.'rod to consider the return of the Dowasir to these Islands after ■ t :heir contum* clous be haviour. After Bndsiyehrc has been settled (which will be done as soon as a levy post can be established there) &amp; perhaps after a year or two when the reforns h vo been fully introdaced ; A -Shsik HanRd's Government securely established, it might be feasible for the .ihaik to allow certain members of thi tribe ( a few were averse to leaving Bahr.-. in but ware compelled by the remiander) to return to some suitable loc lit; on Muh; rraq Island 1 here they will not be close to yh/iah villages.

MEMORANDUM Reference your memorandum No. 86 -G dated 31st March 1924. Before the arrival of the ahove the new Senior Naval Officer, Captain Leir, D.S.O., ^aid hia first visit S / to Bushire; and I discussed the Dowasir question and the necessity for special patrolling of the Bamcs this year with him. He ^.ated that he would visit Bahrain before the middle of April, and I informed him that you would put him au fait with all the details. I told him that in the circumstancee of the case if the Dowasir came on to the usual Bahrain Banks there is sure to be trouble, and asked him to discuss the matter with you and arrange, if possible, for suitable and fairly trequent patrolling of the Banks. He informed me that the 'Cyclamen' would shortly be com- -pieting her refit and returning to the Gulf, while he was expecting H.M.S. 'Lupin' at any time and would be able to place these vessels alternately, he hoped, on the rearl Banks patrol. As the Dowasir boats can get water elsewhere I see no reason v/hy they should go to the IQior Fasht which is, I understand, universally recognized as-a Bahrain spring, and I agree that they may be prevented from doing so, if they attempt it. If Shaikh Hamad will detail intelligent men to accompany His Majesty's Ships I have no doubt th« Senior Naval Officer will be good enough to arrange2 arrange that they will not 'be permitted to come to the recognized Bahrain Islands Banks, or to use the iChor Fasht water or other springs in the immediate neighbourhood of Bahrain. As far as I am at present advised you can inform enquirers that the Dowasir having voluntarily, after receiving due warning as to the consequences, decided to leave Bahrain, it la not the intention of Kis Majesty's % Government to permit them to return for the present at all events until the position in Bahrain haa undergone a great change for the 'better.

I have the honour to bring to your notice two Vtli / cases in which the Amirs of (^atif and Hasa appear to have shown a pointed disregard of the conditions under which the Bahrein Government decided t© expell the Dowasir tribe from Bahrein nearly two years ago, and of its orders proclaimed at the time and enforced since freeing all divers from debts due t© Dowasir Nakhudas ana incurred prior to the latters* expulsion from Bahrein. The two cases are briefly as follows;- (1) A diver named Abdullah bin Mohomed bin Kadhim, a Bahrein subject went to Nejd territory some months ago to visit his brother at Sarin - While there he was sued by his c old Dowasir Nakhuda Abdullah bin Rashid Do sari before the Amir of C^atif for the recovery of a diving debt from which he had been officially released by the Government of Bahrein. The Amir imprisoned him and kept him in stocks for 2-J- months- He was released about the middle of February 1 as ' a ' s a result of representations from thAi Agency through (iasaiMs in Bahrein, but was not at first allowed to leaveleave qatif,^until finally after further representations from the same quarter he arrived in Bahrein about the middle of March 1925» (2) The second case is that ftf a Bahrein subject, a Nakhuda named Mubarak bin Yakub, who went to Hasa about the middle of March last in connection with a claim against a Nejd subject - He was sued before the Amir of Hasa by a Dowasir Nakhuda, Jabar bin Suleiman, now resident in Dhammam, for engaging divers indebted to Dowasir Nakhudas prior to the latter 1 s expulsion from Bahrein. Though Mubarak bin Yakub pleaded that the divers in question had been officially released from their debts by the Bahrein Government, the Amir sent him before the Salifah Court in Hasa, which forced him to sign a document to the effect that he promised never te employ any divers who had ever been in debt to a Dowasir Nakhuda without first paying the full amount of the debt to the Dowasir# On his return to Bahrein in April Mubarak bin Yakub filed a petition in the Bahrein Court asking for a ruling as to whether or not he was bound by this document. I called Khan Bahadur Abdul Aziz ^asaibi to the Agency a few days ago and spoke to him in regard to both these cases. He seemed very iixindisinclined to take any further part in negotiations of this kind between the Agency and Nejdi Authorities on the mainland, and I did not press him in the matter- He assured me however of his conviction that no further cases of this kind would occur in future in view of the fact that the Sultan of Nejd had n© desire to incur the displeasure of H»M# Government or to interfere in any way with measures taken with their approv- -al by the Bahrein Government partic/ularly during the last two years in connection with the introduction of Reforms® I trust that as a result of the above conversatioi iu Khan Bahadur's assurance will have commiini cated itself to the mainland in time t« prevent the accurrenoe of Bimilar incidents^2. incidents during the present diving seasan, when the necessity may occasionally arise for Bahrein diving boats to put in at ^atif or elsewhere on the Hasa Coast. I have ventured however to trouble you with a recital •f these two cases in case the contrary should happen, or you should think fit to take up the matter without further delay with the Sultan of Nejd# 4 1 I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant.

If divers or nakhudas,against whom the Dowasir have claims, are so unwise as to set foot in Nejd territory, it is difficult to support them successfully against the consequences 2.

Please refer to your Memorandum No. 183-S of 30th May. I quite appreciate the Resident's disinclination to enter into correspondence at this juncture with the Sultan of Nejd on the subject of the action recently taken 'by the Amirs of Hasa and ^atif, reported in my Confidential letter No. . 41/1/5 dated 17th May. I did not, I think, advocate such a course. I wish to point out however that, though the Dowasir might be said to have a moral ( but certainly no legal I ) c^laim against the diver ( in the first case mentioned in my letter No. 41/1/3 ), who had actually been employed by them in the past, it is difficult to construct even the shadow of a claim for them against the Nakhuda in the second case, who merely employed their divers according to diving custom; it was no concern of his whether the Bahrein Government chose to give those divers ' free barwas w or not. Further, whether or not the Sultan af Nejd holds views other than those held by Sheikh Hamed himself regard- -ing the confiscation of the Dowasir* s fights, the Sheikh- considers it his duty to protect his subjects as far as he is able from the consequences of his own orders, and he feels that in view of the strong support given him by h.m. Government at the time those orders were passed, H.M. Govern- -ment cannot fail to assist him now in doing so. To The Captain B.

F.B.Prideaux, C.S.I., C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, Delhi. Dowasir tribe of Bahrain. f I have the honour to refer to the correspondence ending with Residency endorsement No. 164-S., dated the 2nd March 1924, regarding the Dowasir tribe of Bahrain. 2. On the introduction of the reforms in Bahrain in 1923 this tribe gave trouble, and it was found necess ary to punish them by inflicting a fine of Ks. 15,000/- on their leading Shaikh. The fine was paid, but rather than submit to the new regime the tribe left their native town of Budaiya and migrated to the promontory of Dammam on the coast of Q,atif, forfeiting their property in Bahrain and — theoretically, though apparently not in practice — their diving rights on the Bahrain pearl banks. 3. When I was in Bahrain in September last, three Shaikhs of the tribe called on me to pay their respects, ^wo, Abdul Latif bin Ibrahim and Isa bin Saad, are gray- beards whom I knew twenty years ago; the third, Ahmad bin Abdallah bin Hasan, a fiery and intolerant young man of about 30, is the son of the powerful headman of my time. It was he who led the tribe in their defiance to Colonel Knox2 Knox in 1923, and he still maintains a stiff-necked and unreasonable attitude. 4. Before I saw the Shaikhs I had heard that two of them had arrived from the pearl banki and the third from Dammam. They had interviewed Shaikh Hamad bin Isa and had confessed to him that they were in very straitened circumstances as the Amir (Wahhabi Governor) of C^atif was imposing taxes on them although Ibn Saud had promised four years ago to exempt them for a period of years. It seems probable also that they have been asked for a quota of men to serve in the Sultan's army, 5. Vi/hen th6A^ appeared before me they at once /Xaised the question of the return of the tribe to Bahrain. I told them that conditions had much improved since their departure and that they must not expect to be allowed back on the same footing as they had previously arrogated to themselves. I thought they could never again claim to be internally independent of the Ruler of Bahrain. They would have to pay the same taxes as other agriculturists and traders, they must be submissive to the Shaikh's Courts in Manameh and Muharraq, and they should accept the police post which had been established in their chief town. Their official headmen would be nominated and could be changed, if necess- -ary, by the Ruler, and their Bahai&gt;ni (Shiah) tenants and ^ &lt; negro divers would be fully protected and have equal rights of citizenship with others of their class. 6. Young Ahmad bin Abdallah said that in these cir- -cumstances they preferred to remain in Daramam ! The others evidently wish to return at any price, but they are overawed by the younger man. 7. Personally, I think it inevitable that the Dowasir tribe will return eventually to Bahrain. Their deserted towntown of Budaiya, substantially built of stone and mortar, and their villages and date-gardens are silently calling for them. They are Malikis in sect, like most of the Sunnis in Bahrain, and many are prosperous pearl merchants. Life on the mainland under Wahhabi rule and exclusion from the Bazaars of Bahrain is hateful to them. They have no ambition to found new towns or plant new gardens. Shaikh Hamad tin Isa undoubtedly has some sympathy for them, as he has always retained the brother of Shaikh Abdul Latif in his personal service. 8. Now I hear that Shaikh Ahmad bin Abdallah and another Dosari, Khamis bin Shahin, have applied to and received from Shaikh Hamad bin Isa letters of recommendat- -ion to carry to the Amir of Hasa and the Sultan of Nejd himself J I fully anticipate that they will return with a letter from His Majesty, asking Shaikh Hamad to restore to the tribe their possessions. 9, It seems desirable, if the Government of India are willing to endorse my views as expressed to the three Shaikhs in Bahrain, that the amiable but weak Shaikh Hamad should be so informed in an authoritative fashion. If he is to modify to any extent the terras on which Ibn Saud may ask him to receive back the tribe, he will be glad to be able to reply that he cannot disregard the advice given him by the Government of India on such a matter. 10.

Q To ano( ! 486ticed •. - I paid a visit to Badaya several boats anchored near or drawn up on the beach of Jiddi island. On enquiry I was informed that these belonged to the Dawasir. The Naturs stationed at Badaya informed me that these Dawasir sometimes cross over by nigiit and attack their barracks. They say that the last attack was dn the 1 night of 14/I5th December. This attacK may or may not have taken place. Certain people are so panicky since the attacx on Sanabis on 3rd November that they fire at shadows and on hearing the sound of their companions rifle imagine that a heavy attack is being made on them. 1 am accordingly net disposed to believe stories of such attacks without some corroboration. The fact remains that Jiddi island is occupied and I have asked Shaikh Hamad whether the occupants art indeed Dawasir and if so whether they are their with his permission. HaJ i iJimad bin Khamis of Sanabis has received a letter from Abdulla i^ohamed Hussain of Tarut to inl orm him that the Dawasir followers of Esa bin Ahmad living Jarain on iarut island The Hon'ble Lt .Col .^.B.Priaeaux,C .S .1. jC .1 .i.., Political Resident, Persian Gulf, - Bu shire*(of island are purchasing arms.

''he Political Resident lays special stress on the second paragraph of the Government of India letter in regard to the necessity of making Shaikh Hamad realise that, in so doing, he is acting in the only way he can in his own interest / and not merely in deference to this Government. The Political Resident has already discussed with you the advisability of Shaikh Hamad asserting himself in Bahrain affairs, and he will inform the Government of India on this point and of the fact that the Shaikh is already beginning to act as desired. I have the honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient servant, Capt. , Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.Record of a meeting; with Shai kh Hamad of iia hrain. On Tuesday 1st March 1927 Shaikh Hamad called on the Hon^le the Political Resident in order to discuss two questions in which he was much interested at the moment. 1. The question of the Shiah petitions against the further retention of Shaikh Khallaf, a Qadhi of Bahrain. 2. The return of confiscated property to its former Dowasir owners. The Political Rgsident advised H.E. Shaikh Hamad to settle the matter of the Q,adhi according to his own discretion 'but pointed out that the mere fact of the presentation of petitions bearing numer/ous signatures did not necessarily x prove that the Qadhi or anyone (mentioned) was 'blameworthy. As Shaikh Hamad obviously desired this course, the Political Resident stated that he would hear what Shaikh Khallaf had to say, and if necessary, advise himself to absent himself from Bahrain for a time, either for the purpose of paying a pilgrimage to Kerbela, or for any other reason that he might prefer to give out. 2. Shaikh Hamad then showed the Political Resident a letter he had received from Ibn Saud expressed in general terms, but stating that he considered it desirable that the Dowasir property in Bahrain should be returned to them. He stated that he was personally in favour of complying with this request but wished to be guided by the Political Resident's advice. The Resident stated that the return of the confis- -cated property was a matter for Shai-kh Hamad to decide for himself, but before he permitted the Dowasir themselves to return he should look to the future and consider his own interests. The existence in these small islands of any authority independent of his own would be bound eventually to lead to xa-K trouble. Ibn Saud himself was the last man to tolerate any authority but his own in his dominions. The Dowasir, if they came back, should return as ordinary subjects withwith no rights superior to those of the other subjects of His Sxcellency. Shaikh Hamad said that this question of the return of the Dowasir did not arise as yet. The point for decision was the return of the confiscated property and he as an Arab Chief felt it to 'be a just slur on his honour that he should 'be considered 'by his neighbours to have confiscated the pro- -perty of his subjects and put it in his own pocket. On former occasions when there had been trouble with Arab tribes, such as the A1 bin Ali, private property had not been confis- -cated though the tribesmen themselves had been compelled to leave the islands. He anticipated that the return of their confiscated property would eventually lead to the return of the owners, but this was likely to occur gradually. He would be care- -ful to ensure that the Dowasir returned only as his subjects with no rights greater than those enjoyed by the other tribal coimnunities in the island, such as the Al bin Ali, Sardar and Nairn. The Resident repeated that he did not object to the return of the confiscated property but he warned Shaikh Hamad carefully to consider the future interests not only of himself but his descendants. Shaikh Muhammad bin Esa, brother of Shaikh Hamad, and Major Barrett, Political Agent, Bahrain were present at the interview. Sd/- C.

Sir, I have the honour to forward for the orders of the Political Resident a conralfication No. 9?4 Con. of 20th Shawal, received from the Adviser, Bahrain State. I recommend that the proposal to force the divers who fomerly dived for Dowasir Kakhudas to return to service under the nakhudas and to load them with their former debts should meet with a decided negative. As regards the other matters Shaikh Haraad says it is contrary to Arab ideas for a ruler to confis cate the whole of the property of a tribe leaving his dominions, and that hejonly consented to this course because he considered it was em order from Government which he was bound to obey. As the property of the Dowasir has been restored to them he considers he should restore the past rents which have been credited to the State, both because it was a right and because he would please Bin Saud u by so doing. y I informed him that Bin Saud's wishes had nothing to do with the case; He replied that Bin Saud was the one big Arab ruler and it was natural for all the smaller l ilemaller Shaiklie such ae himEelf to look up to him and try to pleaee him. He further stated that the Dowacir had left Bahrain not of their own volition but from fear of the Government. They had taken part in a murderous attack on the village of Ali and were suspected of murdering two Sayeds and so considered that Government intended to give them additional punishment for these crimes. The Dowasir having left Bahrain unlike the al-han Ali and other tribes before them did nothing whatever to disturb the peace of the island. He considered that if the Dowasirs are now to return they should be allowed to teturn without any cause of grievance against the Sx State. When Shaikh Abdulla bin Isa came to cay good bye to me I asked him as to his Opinion in this matter. He informs me that there is no doubt whatever that the Dowasir left Bahrain through fear and not through hatred. He says he considers the return to them of their property a good move but he thinks Shaikh Hamad is going a little too far in wishing to return all the rents taken from the tribe. I do not care for Shaikh Hamad 's references to Bin Saud and his very obvious desire to please him. My recent trip up the Trucial Coast has shown me what real power the Wahabis possess there and the ready grant of all Bin Saud's requests on behalf of the Dowasir tribe would increase his prestige in these islands to a very undesirable extent. In addition £ b the Dowasir when they left the islands had been warned repeatedly that their departure would involve the confiscation of their property. It is absurd therefore for them to claim the return of this propertyl b property together with all past rente as a right aE they appear to be doing from Shaikh Hamad. I agree with Mr. Eelgrave that to comply with all their denande would be too gceat a surrender to them and to the infTtiience of Bin Saud'e recommerdatione. At the eame time the property at Badaya hae certainly deteriorated coneidera^ly in thai r enforced absence and although the T are in a position to borrow money to purchase boats, the Dowaslrs are in a bad financial position. For these reasons and as an act of grace 1 recommend that one third ofily of the past rents be returned to them as an assistance to enable them to resume their tormer position in the State, when they are so disposed. Shaikh Hamad is oprosed to the holding forth of the past rent merely as a bait to induce the Dowasir to return. I have the honour to be tir. Your most obedient servant. Political Agent, BahrainG07ER3MEHT OP BAHRAIN Ho- of 1345. Office of the Adviser to the Government, Bahrain, Dated 20th Shawaal, 1345 To The H, B. Li's Political Agent, Bahrain. Sir, Return of the Dawasir. I have the honour to inform you of the following facts and renuest that you will please make them known to the Hon 1 hie the Political Resident who would perhaps give a ruling on the questions in point which have not been speci fically raised 'before. The Hon'hle the Political Resident informed H # E. Shaikh Hgmad that the Government of I^dia were prepared to sanction the return of the Dav/asir to Bahrain on the condition that they accepted certain terms. If they agreed to these terms their property consisting of houses in Manama and Budaiya, dategardens and 'Doulahs' were to 'be returned to them. Their property has 'been return to them. T^e houses, which had 'been sold 'by the State, were 'bought back and compensation was paid to the 'buyers on account of repairs executed by them during their term of residence; the leases of all the gardens which had been let by the State during the three years absence of the Dawasir from Bahrain, have been transferred back to the original owners. This has cost the State Rs. 40,000/-. But the Dawasir Shaikhs now demand that the State should return to them all the rents which accrued from the gardens, iarcm 'Ww gunfafcupa during the three years, amounting to Rs#page -2- They evidently consider that the permission granted them to return, and the restoration of their property 'by the State, wipes out any idea that they deserved punishment for their former 'behaviour. They insist that the restoration of their property must ^Iso include the repayment of the three years rents. Unfortunately they have persuaded Shaikh Hamad to agree with their views. At the time of their intended departure, they were warned that if they persisted in going, their property would he confiscated, and their Bahraini divers would be freed from any obligation or debts to their Dawasir Narkhudas. They understood the terms and the/ /ent# The State released the divers giving each man a certificate signed by the Shaikh and the Political Agent cancelling his debts and allowing him to dive with whomsoever he wished. The State sold most of the houses and let the gardens. The ownership of the property, presumably, reverted to the State. Although the Dawasir suffered a certain amount 0: ^ oppression from the Huler of ITejd during their stay on the mainland they now adopt the attitude of being strongly supported by Ibn Saud. Shaikh Hamad is at all times exceedingly anxious to stand well in the eyes Ox Ibn baud. This fact and the continuous pestering by the Dawasir Shaikhs has contributed mainly to his attitude on the subject. Also he thinks that if the rents are not paid to them the Dawasir will always feel sore on the subject considering' themselves rightlyrightly entitled to them. He feels that because the original oonfisoation was made in his name ( an action which he only took after considerable persuasion) it is incumbent on him to return the money and as no mention was made of the rents in the terms on which the Dawasirs return g he supposes that the return of the rents is taken for granted. In my opinion, being as Financial Adviser, responsible for the finances of the State, this large outlay from the already overburdened revenues of the State in order to buy the goodwill of the Dawasir is not justifiable, unless it is the intention of the Government that all measures that were previously taken against the Dawasir by the Government are to be entirely wiped out, except of course their three years exile which is past, in which case I venture to suggest that a wrong impression will be given, the impression that the Government have now decided that it acted 7 /rongly in punishing the tribe in the way that it did. You kindly said that you would support me in an endeavour to prevent large payments. My own position here is difficult and were it generally knevn that I was the deciding factor in preventing this payment, it would be decidedly more difficult. I therefore ask that a definite ruling should be given on these two points. 1. Whether the rents for the three years paid into the State funds by tenants on the confiscated estates must be handed back to the Dawasir. 2. Thether the Bahrain State is to force the divers of the Dawasir/who were freed from all debts and obligation to dive with their Dawasir ITarkhudaS /to return to the Dawasir, or whether the State is to compensate these ITarkhudas for the loss of the divers, and the writing off of the divers' debts ( a matter of probably two or three lacs).page -4- I may add that the Dawasir are not in the almost starving condition^whloh they are at present representing themselves to 'be,as several of them have lately 'bought large 'boats from Bahrain* Also the Shaikh's opinion as to the further restoration of their » alleged rights is not held even by his own family, as Shaikh Abdulla, his 'brother, and Shaikh Salman, his eldest son, are not in agreement with him on the subject. I would also inform that naturally no provision was made in this year's 'budget for any payments to the Dawasir neither for another heavy item, i .e., the payment for I n dian Troops lent by the Government of India. I have the honour to be. Sir, Your Obedient Servant, Adviser the Government, Bahrain.CONF DjENT I AX • Ho. 138-S of 19^7o The British HeBidency and ConBiaate General Bushire, let.

Political Refiiaent in the Persian Gulf. j ^ r .i'], n' To The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Lepartment. Sir. / T » I have the honour to Btate that in ay letter No. 87-S dated the 27th. March 1927, reporting my action with regard to the Dowaeir tribe which desires to come back to Bahrein, I stated that a letter of recommendation which the Lowasir chiefs had brought with them to me from Ibn Saud, was part of an arrangement between the Sheikh of Babrein and the Dowasir chiefs, and that Ibn Saud's recommendation was obtained with all of their knowledge to strengthen the Sheikh of Bahrein's hana with the Resident in the matter. -y? In my report Ho 87 -8 quoted, I gave my reasons for allowing the return of the Eowasir, provided that it v .as , made quite clear to them that they came back a. ordinary individuals, and I also gave obvious reasons for allowing them to take back their neglected properties which were empty of owners and were going through lack ot care to rack and ruin; even in the few cases where the place® had been purchased under pressure no development had been possible. The return of their properties has c«st the State - Ss .40 ,000/-, but thiB 2s .40 ,00C /w was money which haa been paid Into State funds and iB now paid out again. It la .V no loss but a gain as the properties will now once more b&lt;developped. I now forward a letter No. C-53 dated the P.4th« April 1927, from the Political Agent Bahrein, which haB arrived today with an enclosure dated the 20th, Shawal 1345 from the Finan cial AdviBor Bahrein. The Political Agent's letter will probably necespitate my visiting Bahrein again. It 1 b quite obvious that where the Dowasir tribe has been punished with expulsion for three years for offences which they have committed, they cannot be given the rents which have accrued to the Bahrein Government during that absence, without undoing the result of the punishment given. It would mean, not forgiveness, but a confession by us (not by Sheikh Hamad) that we had been harsh. The Political Agent suggests that a thira of the rentals shcuid be returned on account of repairs necessary to the aete- riorated properties and the poverty the tribe. I propose that if it is found that a sum is necessary for the rehabili tation of the property, that that sum shall have no connection with the forfeited rentals. X ara prepared to recommend the Bahrein Government to allow, ap^»« act of government, fmch Bum as may be necessary to enable the properties to become habita ble and productive, but the principle of the punishment given and the forgiveness on promise of better conduct for the futxrt • • must be maintained. For the satne reason I propose to agree with the Political Agent's recommendation that no diver shall be forced to go back to the Lowasir with his previous debt maintained against him. The pearl diving trade is built up on a form of slavery dependent upon the debts of the divers, and the cancellation o; such debts will certainly be a very severe handicap to the Dowasir tribe. In anv case it would be ompossible for us to saddle the t ** V divers with their old slavery, the more especially as they hav probably acquired a new one with new masters. The dievr is an imprudent person, who readily takes andl-y taken- ana Bpende advances which he can never repay. The chief interest in these letters, and the reason I attach them in full, is that they show the growing strength of the Wahabi influence in the Persian CKilf, but I axn approaching this subject in a seperate despatch with k reference to Bahrein,, I have the honour to be, • \ Sir, Your most obedient servant, j , , ^ ^ * Lieut.

Ho. i54-S. of 1927• British Reeiciency and Coneulate^General, Bushire, 9th May 1927, From To Captain C.G.Prior, I.A., Secretary to the Political Beoident In the Persian Gulf, The Political Agent, Bahrain. Sir, I am directed to refer to your letter Ho. C-53., dated 24th April 1927, with an enclosure dated the 20th Shawal 1346, from the Financial Adviser, Bahrain, on the subject of the return of the Dowaslr tribe. The Hon'ble the Political Resident is of the opinion that where the tribe has been punished with expulsion for three years, for offenoes which they have committed, they should certainly not be given the rents which have accrued to the f Bahrain Government during their absence, as this would undo the \ result of the punishment given. It would, in fact, be a confession on our part that we had acted harshly. With regard to your suggestion that a third of the rentals should be returned on account of repairs necescary to the deteriorated properties and of the poverty of the tribe, the Political Resident considers that if any sum is found necessary for such a purpose, that sum should have no connectior with the forfeited rentals. '.'he allotment should rather take the form of an act of government on the part of Bahrain who, having justly punished the tribe, now forgives them on a promise of better behaviour for the future and allows them ail sum for the rehabilitation of their properties and their being made productive. On the same principle he agrees with your recommend- -ation that no diver shall be forced to return to the Dowasir with his previous debt maintained against him. These debts having been cancelled once could not be again placed upon the debtors, who have probably taken other work. These joints should be made clear to Shaikh Hamad and it should be impressed upon him that they are nvoessities of good government. The Government of India have been adaressed upon these lines, and on receipt of their reply, you will receive a further communication regarding this question.

Sir, I hare the honour to forward herewith a copy of a letter dated the 3rd Zi Alqadah from H .E. Sheikh Hamad 'bin Isa al Khalifa to this office. As will be seen it deals vvith the subject of the return of pa»t rents to the I&gt;owasir tribe, two other suc^ communications hare been received from His Excellency lately, as well as several rerbal requests for informa tion on the subject. I understand that the Dowasir wealth has been very much depleted during their absence on the mainland,Qre- sumably they had to build or buy houses for themselrei, pay heary taxes to Ibn Saud and incur other expenditure inseparaule from mo zing ones goods and chattels from one place to another. In addition to this they lost the rer^ nue of their property here and will, on their return iutx have to engage in repairs to their houses atBellijah I most of which will require some form of renovation. Considering this it seems that it might be a good policy to start them off with a little capital; Major Barrett suggested one third of their property revenues which accrued to the State during the three years of their absence, which amounted to Rs.64,000/-, this would be just over Rs.21,000/-. In view of the circumstances under which this tribe left Bahrein, I think this v ^ould be a very gener ous donation to them, and, when they know definitely &gt; thatthat the matter is settled they will cease to troulele Sheiich Mamad any further, * I hare the honour to fee, Sir, ^our most obedient servant, Captain, .

I proposed that half the sum oe paid in this year and half after Gaffal this year. As the diving season is approaching and they have received no money I suggest that in view of their poverty payment of their money should fee effected soon.

In a matter like this where Hamad feels he has be0n aiscredited as an Arab among Arabs, ano had apparant ly had to enlist Ibn Saud * s help to circmvent our V/estern ideas of managing Arabs, would it not prima facie be wise to let him have his head a bit more ? After all we want him to rule his tribe himself and he can only learn through mistaken. Let him have wholesome advice, of course, but let the responsibility be really his. We s^em to be drifting perilously near to Bah rain becoming a British Island to total extinction of Shaikh. Unless you can by your personal influence give matter a quiet but decisive turn in other directions, I suggest your putting the Government of India in poss^s- sion of of acts of existing situation, summing up the js-rm pros and cons with your recommendations for future. Otherwise there is danger of Government of India and H.M. f s Government being presented with a position which runs counter to their declared policy and from ch i L k which it, may be too late to escape.
