The Resident Adviser, whose post has recently been created, is not the direct representative of His Majesty, being under the authority of the. Governor of Aden, but he is the chief agent of His Majesty’s Government in the territory ruled by the Sultan of Shihr and Mukalla, the premier chief of the Eastern area of the Aden Protectorate, and is responsible for tendering (aA' t\A/i fc Iao ^r tfos av - advice to His Highness on all matters arising out of the 'KyvvvjA) Sa kw AA* It- 3^-^treaty concluded with the Sultan in 1937. .

I am to enquire whether in these circumstances Lord Zetland would see any objection to a salute of 11 guns being accorded.to the Resident Adviser at Mukalla. A similar letter is being addressed to the Admiralty. I am, Sir, Your most obedient servant,78018/37 [No. 120]. PROOF. No. THE GOVERNOR to THE SECRETARY OF STATE. (Received 1st September, 1937.) [Answered by No. 78018/37 [Ao. 134].] (Confidential (2).) Sir, Governor’s Office, Aden, 18th August, 1937. I have the honour to refer to my telegram No. 12 of 13th August*, regarding the conclusion of a Treaty with the Sultan of Shihr and Mukalla, and to transmit herewith the original Treatyf, copies of the Notes exchanged between myself and the Sultan, and a letter from myself to the Sultan, the terms of which were taken from Mr. Cowell’s semi-official letter of 3rd JuneJ. 2. In your telegram No. 29 of the 12th February § you conveyed to me the approval of His Majesty’s Government for the conclusion of a Treaty by which the Sultan would bind himself to receive a British Resident Adviser and to act on his advice in all matters except those concerning Muhammadan religion and customs. In consideration of his signing this Treaty the Sultan was to receive a loan of about three lakhs for approved working development. 3. As I have reported to you in my confidential despatch of the 31st March||, the Sultan rejected this offer, but at a later date it became evident that although he was not willing to submit to any control of his internal affairs in order to secure the advantages which a loan would have made possible, he was nevertheless probably prepared to do so in order to be able to secure the succession of his son to the Sultanate, and in your confidential despatch of the 24th Mayf you requested that the Sultan should be encouraged to submit definite proposals under which he would accept a British Adviser and sign a Treaty binding himself and his successors to act on his advice in all matters except those of Muhammadan religion and custom. 4. As stated in my telegram No. 12 of the 13th August* § **, the Treaty that the Sultan has now signed embodies the policy desired by His Majesty’s Government; and it further secures the additional advantage of giving to His Majesty’s Government the right of approval to each successive heir nominated by the Sultans, and in this respect is similar to the provisions of the Zanzibar Protectorate Treaty of the 14th June, 1890. 5. The word “ accept ” in Article 1 seemed perhaps a little less peremptory than the “ ask ” and “ act upon ” of the Perak Treaty, and in view of the final paragraph of Mr. Cowell’s semi-official letter of the 3rd Junef j, I consider that this expression is adequate. The words “ for the welfare of his State ” were inserted with a view of meeting in some degree a request by the Sultan that the expression ‘' for the improvement of his State ” should be added after the words “ on all matters ”. As the Sultan’s proposal appeared to limit the power sought considerably, and as in fact it subsequently transpired from the Sultan himself that it was intended to do so, I decided that it could not be accepted in the form desired by him, but that there was no objection to the additional words in the position in which they now stand. The Sultan, after some hesitation, agreed to this alteration, and he then assured me that he signed the Treaty willingly. He further sent his Secretary Khan Bahadur Sheikh Ali Ba-Akza to see me the day after the signature to express his apologies for his hesitation, and to say that he was perfectly content with the situation. 6. The Sultan was not particularly anxious to insert in the Treaty provision for the dispossessed heir and for this reason I consented to the arrangement embodied in the Notes which, as you will observe, reserves final approval to His Majesty’s Government. 7. The Sultan was subjected to considerable pressure in the shape of anonymous letters and other reproaches from persons who accused him with selling his State to the British, but he eventually brought himself to a sufficient pitch of courage to sign, and I thought it advisable to conclude the matter at once, subject to the final approval and confirmation of His Majesty’s Government. 8. The Sultan has requested that the Treaty should not be made public for a month, during which time the opposition will get more used to the idea. I have consented, if and when your approval is given, to issue the enclosed Notice, and the Sultan, in consequence of advice he has been given by Mr. Ingrams, decided also to issue a Notice * No. 78018/37 [No. 109]. f Copy printed as Enclosure 1. $ No. 78018/37 [No. 84]. § No. 78018/37 [No. 22], || No. 78018/37 [No. 47]. f No. 78018/37 [No. 62], ** No. 78018/37 [No. 109]. ft No. 78018/37 [No. 84].

I enclose for your information a copy of the Sultan's proposed Proclamation. 9. As I was authorized in your telegram No. 29 of the 12th February*, I have given the Sultan to understand that the salary of the Adviser will be paid by His Majesty's £ Government, and I shall shortly address you with regard to the establishment required for the Hadhramaut. 10. I have not as yet received your approval to the proposal in my despatch Confidential 2 of the 14th Aprilf that Mr. Ingrams should be appointed Adviser to the Kathiri Sultan, and I have under consideration at present a proposal that the Kathiri Sultan should also be invited to sign a Treaty of a nature similar to that accepted by the Sultan of Mukalla. 11. Although the Treaty has now been obtained without the promise of a loan, I trust that it will prove possible to grant it, and I propose shortly to address you on this subject also. I have, &amp;c., B. R. REILLY, Governor. Enclosure 1 in No. TREATY BETWEEN HIS MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT IN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND HIS HIGHNESS THE SULTAN OF SHIHR AND MUKALLA.

On the occasion of the signing of the new Treaty between myself and His Majesty’s Government I have to inform Your Excellency that in accordance with Article 2 thereof • I nominate my son Prince Awadh as my successor to the throne of Mukalla and I shall be grateful if the approval of His Majesty’s Government may be formally conveyed to me. 2. I take this opportunity of expressing to Your Excellency my undertaking to make such provision for the son of the late Sultan as the revenues of my State can afford and as His Majesty’s Government may consider reasonable. Furthermore I intend to confer on Sultan Muhammad bin Umar the title of “ Prince ” and I trust this action of mine may meet with the approval of His Majesty’s Government. I am, &amp;c., Saleh bin Ghalib, His Excellency Sultan of Shihr and Mukalla. Sir Bernard Rawdon Reilly, K.C.M.G., C.I.E., O.B.E., Governor and Commander-in-Chief of the Protectorate of Aden. Enclosure 3 in No. Dear Friend, Government House, Aden, 13th August, 1937. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Highness’s letter of to-day’s date on the occasion of the signing of the new Treaty and I note that Your Highness nominates Prince Awadh as heir-apparent to the Mukalla State. I have much pleasure in conveying to Your Highness the approval of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom to this nomination. 2. I am glad to observe that Your Highness proposes to make such provision for Sultan Muhammad bin Umar as the revenues of Your Highness’s State may be able to afford and I shall be glad to be informed of the amount proposed for the approval of His Majesty’s Government. I note Your Highness intends to confer the title of “ Prince ” on Sultan Muhammad bin Umar, and he will be so addressed in official correspondence from this Government. I am, &amp;c., B. R. Reilly, Governor of the Protectorate of Aden. His Highness Sultan Salih bin Ghalib al Qu’aiti, Sultan of Shihr and Mukalla. Enclosure 4 in No. Dear Friend, Government House, Aden, 13th August, 1937. I take this opportunity of conveying to Your Highness in writing my congratulations on the signing of the new Treaty and of expressing my confidence that the new relationship thus established will lead to an era of fruitful collaboration between His Majesty’s Government and Your Highness in the promotion of the prosperity of Your Highness’s State. 2. I understand that Your Highness has felt some apprehension that the acceptance of an Adviser would reduce your own powers to insignificance. This is by no means the intention of His Majesty’s Government; and I think that if Your Highness understood the relations of His Majesty’s Government with the Malay States you would realize this. 3. In all, ten Malay Rulers, within and without the Federation, have accepted Resident Advisers. Some of them have voluntarily entered into treaties of this nature in quite recent years, after long experience of the working of the Adviser system in neighbouring States. There have been very few cases of material disagreement between the Ruler and the Adviser, and the onfy serious case recently has concerned the succession in the State—a matter which in Mukalla is settled by the new Treaty. 4 It should be understood that the advice to be given to Your Highness in all matters of internal concern is based solely on Your Highness’s Adviser’s view of the interests of the State and of Your Highness. It has been the policy of His Majesty's Government to maintain the authority of the Ruler in all such matters. In matters of foreign relations other considerations must necessarily enter; but in this sphere Your Highness is already bound, both by treaty and by force of circumstances, to follow the advice of the Protecting Power.4 5. Your Highness should also understand that in the event of serious disagreement between yourself and your Adviser, it will be open to you to appeal to the Governor and even to the Secretary of State, but I feel confident that such disagreement is unlikely to arise. I am, &amp;c., B. R. Reilly, Governor of the Protectorate of Aden. His Highness Sultan Salih bin Ghalib al Qu’aiti, Sultan of Shihr and Mukalla. Enclosure 5 in N,o. NOTICE. In view of certain rumours having been recently disseminated to the effect that the Qu’aiti Sultanate of Shihr and Mukalla was being annexed, His Excellency the Governor desires it to be categorically stated that this rumour is utterly unfounded and that His Majesty’s Government have never entertained any such intention. On the contrary at the request of His Highness the Sultan, who is extremely desirous of promoting the welfare of his country. His Majesty’s Government has agreed to provide the Sultan with the necessary advice and assistance to achieve his desires. His Excellency desires it to be widely known that the whole policy of His Majesty s Government in the Protectorate is directed towards upholding and strengthening the authority and dignity of the Chiefs and the improvement of their territories. Enclosure 6 in No. 786. PUBLIC NOTICE. Now by the grace of God I have returned to my country and people hale and hearty after attending the Coronation ceremonies of His Majesty the King George VI in London. During my journey and on my return I heard several rumours which are current everywhere that the British Government has taken possession of my State and my authority and dignity will be suffered. These rumours are entirely false and unfounded. I have already brought to the notice of His Excellency the Governor at Aden about these rumours and His Excellency the Governor has already very kindly published the state ment totally denying of such intentions of His Majesty’s Government and declaring all such rumours false and unfounded and you all can read the same in the Aden Protectorate Gazette dated The British Government has not the least intention to take even an inch of our land and they have also declared to uphold my authority and dignity. Under the above circumstances I am now desirous that all such false rumours should forthwith be stopped and if any person or persons after this notice are still found spreading such false rumours which are injurious to my State and myself they will be severely dealt with, punished and transported. Only for the welfare and vast improvements of our State I have asked the services of Mr. Ingrams from the British Government to work under me as my Resident Adviser because without an expert British officer the British Government will not give us all sorts of help for the vast improvements of our State as our means are limited. You all know very well that Mr. Ingrams during his short stay in my absence, has done well in establishing the peace, etc., andl hope he will work sincerely in complete co-operation and harmoniously with me in future under me for the improvements of my State. Now by the grace of God I will give you a very good piece of information and which is this that according to my powers of the Sultan as the Ruling Chief of Mukalla, Shihr and Hadhramaut and also according to our religious orders of Shafaees I have nominated and declared that my son Prince Sultan Awad bin Saleh bin Ghalib Alkaity to be the heir-apparent of Mukalla, Shihr and Hadhramaut now and the Ruling Sultan of all countries under me mentioned above after me and I have also great pleasure to inform you all that our friend the British Government have already accepted my nomination and declaration that Prince Awad becomes the heir-apparent of my State in my life time and the Ruling Sultan after me. It is a matter of great satisfaction that the succession of Mukalla State has been established in the direct line of the late Sultan Awad for ever which will also be a great benefit to my family as well as the State and my subjects.

Dear Yfalton, Will you please refer to Lai tAwaite 1 s letter to me P.Z.7877/33 dated 4th December 1933 enclosing copies of my letter of the 10th August 1933 on points arising in connection with the transfer of Aden, and of the minutes of the meeting at the Foreign Office at which my letter was discussed? As it has been proposed that l should go to England this summer to discuss details connected with the transfer with the India Office and the Colonial Office, I have prepared a note reviewing.the fourteen points that were then discussed, ard adding remarks on further questions that appear to me to require consideration and decision before the transfer takes place. I enclose a copy of this note. I also enclose a copy of a draft estimate for Aden (as distinct from the Aden Protectorate) showing probable revenue and expenditure after its separation from India. I am sending a copy of the note and of the draft estimate to the Colonial Office and to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India. Yours sincerely, (SD.) B.R.Eeilly. Walton, Esq., C.B.,M.C. ,M.A. India Office, London.Af 9 4 t-f L. - t Point 18 , Table of Precedence . At present the precedence of senior officers serving in Aden is regulated by the Indian Warrant of Precedence. When Aden is separated from India their appointments will disappear in this Warrant, and their precedence must then be regulated by the Colonial Office Administration. Aden being a Naval, Militaiy and Air Force centre, it is necessary to decide relative seniority of civil officials with Naval, Military and Air Force officers. At present the Political Secretary ranks below a Lieutenant-Colonel, the Civil Secretary and District Magistrate ranks with a Major, and the Chairman of the Aden Port Trust ranks between the two. In my opinion, the grading of all these three officers ought to be raised. The Political Secretaiy should rank with Lieutenant-Colonels, » and the Chairman of the Aden Port Trust and Settlement (who holds a most responsible position) might well do the same. The Civil Secretaiy might also be put on the same grade as the Political Secretary. The District and Sessions Judge at present ranks above Lieutenant-Colonels, and I think that this should remain unchanged. I recommend that his—designation under Colonial Administration be Chief Justice and Legal -Adviser or Judge and Legal Adviser. I recommend that the opportunity of a change in the Warrant of Precedence be taken to make the alterations that I have suggested. The Civil Administrative Medical Officer, the Port Officer and the Commandant of Police at present rank in accordance with their seniority in their own Services, all three at present being graded with Lieutenant-Colonels. As long as these posts are filled by officers of the Indian Services this practice mi^it continue; but in view of possible changes in future I suggest that the appointments of Civil Administrative Medical Officer and Port Officer be classed with Lieutenant-Co lone Is and that of the Commandant of Police between Lieutenant-Co lone Is and Majors. The Officer in charge of the Aden Administration is now the Resident, Chief Commissioner and Commander-in- Chief, being Resident in respect of the Protectorate and Chief Commissioner in respect of Aden. I understand that it is the intention of His Majesty*8 Government that he will in future be termed Governor and Commander-in-Chief, this designation being in respect of both Aden and the Protectorate, At present he ranks 13 in the Indian Warrant of Precedence and is entitled to a salute of 13 guns. After the transfer his appointment will disappear from the Indian Warrant and I presume that his salute will be increased to 17 guns in accordance with paragraph 52 of the King’s Regulations and Admiralty Instructions. Visits of British and Foreign warships are frequent at Aden and calls between the Resident and Commander-in-Chief and Naval Officers are regulated by paragraph 99 of the King’s Regulations and Admiralty Instructions. The practice in this respect will be altered if the Resident is given the status of the Governor. The Air Officer Commanding at Aden now ranks at 33 in the Indian Warrant: in future he will presumably rank* © in Aden immediately after the Governor, It will be necessary to give the Treasurer a position in the new Warrant and this will depend on the relative seniority that he should hold in respect of other civil officials and of Naval, Military and Air Force officers in Aden, and on the position that he will hold as a member of the Executive Council, At present the two Political Officers, the Frontier Officer, the Education Officer, the Civil Surgeon, the Assistant Commandant of Police and the Extra Assistant Commissioner have no positions in the Warrant, and it is for consideration whether any or all of these officers ought to be graded.© 25th August, 1932.

You are quite right in saying that, as a &lt; , * it was decided that, on the whole, the best course Yours sincerely, T. G.LAITHWAITE,DSQ.The question oi the salute to he given to the Resident at Aden was discussed informally on 20th Jui^ at the Colonial Office, with Mr. Parkinson, Mr. Howard and Mr. Howell (of their Ceremonial Section). I said that we quite recognised that this was a matter which was of interest to the Colonial Office and in which it was only reasonable that the fullest possible weight should be given to their view. On the other hand, in the first place, we regarded it as an India Office question and one, therefore, in which the correspondence should be handled by the India Office, if correspondence with other Departments here was necessary; c^-ns-oq-uenMMy- -that- while we should, if the Colonial Office felt strongly, be quite prepared to raise the matter again with India, we were ourselves averse from doing so. The Resident, by Indian standards, was a relatively unimportant officer and it was obviously necessary for the Government of India to consider, in dealing with a question such as this, the possibility of reactions on similar or more highly placed officers under their control. The Conmissloner in Sind, who governed a population of some five million people, at the moment was entitled to 13 guns only, and the Chief Commissioner of the North West Frontier Province, who had a population of some three million, and had to deal with very important political questions, likewise had 13 only up to a few days ago, when the North Y/est Frontier/o Frontier Province was turned into a Governor's Province. We had reason to believe that the Government of India were anxious not unduly to magnify the importance of the Resident at Aden, and there could he no question of his position suffering if the number of guns were left at 13. This was what he had himself recommended and it had been the salute of the Resident for a very great many years. The Colonial Office agreed that the matter was one for the India Office to handle and,further, that the orders ultimately passed must be passed by the Government of India, which was the authority in lKj respect of Indian areas, such y _the Settlement of Aden and tee Aden Waters, inasmuch as these were Indian v/aters for the purpose of salutes. On the question of the number of guns, after considerable discussion, they agreed that the salute should be left at 13. It was agreed that a letter on the lines of that attached should be sent to the Colonial Office (with a copy to the Admiralty) with a view to closing the discussion.INDIA OFFICE, 3*:V. 1. 20th July 1932. W dear Homrd, I write with reference to our recent correspondence on the subject of the salute to he accorded to the Resident at Aden* to put on record that we discussed this question in all its hearings at a meeting to-day. I thinlc I am right in saying that* as the re suit of examination of the relevant precedents and analogies, we came to the conclusion that on the whole the hast course would probably be to leave the Resident’s salute at 13 guns ana let the question of any enhancement rest, will you let me know if this correctly represents our conclusions* In that event it would be unnecessary to trouble the Admiralty (to whom I am sending a copy of this letter) further in the matter, and we would make ourselves responsible for intimating the decision to the Government of inaia. F*J. Howard, Ssq. Colonial Office, 3.W. 1. Yours sincerely, J • Gr • LAITHWAITE.90710/3 Downing Street, n July, 1932. My dear Laithv/aite, With, reference to Clauson’s letter P.Z .3240/ 32 of the 1st June and telephone conversation with Parkinson on the 3rd June as to the salute to be accorded to the Resident at Aden, we are still awaiting the receipt of the official reply from the India Office to our letter of the 28th May. In the meantime we have received from the Admiralty a copy of their letter to you of the 3rd June, and I enclose a copy of a letter which we have sent to that Department, setting out the Colonial office view. Even though the correspondence about the definition of Indian waters makes the Government of India the authority as to the salutes to be fired in the waters of Aden, it must be remembered that the Resident is the Of fic er 7; G . LAITHWAITE, ESQ,.,Officer of His Majesty’s Government in regard to military and political affairs. It seems clear to us tiierefo re , that the authori ty of tme Governmen.t.of India should only be exercised in his case with the concurrence of His Majesty’s Government. You may remember too, that it was agreed between the India Office and the Colonial Office that the Resident should occupy in relation to Hip Majesty’s Government the position of. an ordinary. Colonial Governor. In view of these considerations and of the facts stated in our letter to the Admiralty, vie hope the India Office wi 11 be able to reconsider the matter. You will remember that the telegram from the Government of India, a copy of which was enclosed in the India Office letter of the 23rd May, did not rule out the possibility of a 15 gun salute to the Resident. Yours sincerely, h- !/ / © ii 1 JuXy Z 90710/32, Sir* I a?rv directed % Secretary sir ini lip CualtffWJster to refer to your letter 101275/32 to tne India Gffioe of tne 3rd June relative to the un salute t© Oe aooordsd to tiao Issidon t and Coafflaader-in-CnSof at Aden# in wnien it is stated t&amp;at tde Jjords Joui-Jssioners of tile ,'idairalty do rxot consider tnat any occasion for a 15 gun salute arises, 2« it does not appear that their Lordships, in arriving at tills conclusion, have taken into consideration the position which this officer Lolas in regard to matters for which the Secretary of taie for the Colonies is responsible. 3.
