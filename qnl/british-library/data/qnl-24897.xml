The Shaikh’s excuse was that the man was a habitual offender, md that the Truoial Shaikhs could not afford to maintain men in prison. It is hoped that this punishment will not be inflicted again. UB116. KU'TKIT ; -» a. The Ruler:- hie J^xcellenoy the Ruler of Kuweit inforeed the Iolitical Kgent officially on the 28th December that he had Issued a notification, declaring 1st January a public holiday in Kuweit every year, just as he had made His Majesty f s birthday, a day of rejoicing and State holiday last summer. b. electricity for the town :— On the 8th December the Ruler granted a concession to a Jewish Company of Daud Moshi Aghaal and feOahi hesicail »aKil Brothers of Baghdad for the supply of electricity to the town. Under the terms of concession the above firm will have the sole right to supply Kuweit with electricity for a period of 35 years. The Ruler is to get Re. 3000/- per annum from the Company. The charge per unit is to be 6 annas or 3 rupee* per lamp of 30 can le power. Two large engines will be imported and the plant must be in full working order within 6 months from the date of signing the contract. It seems very doubtful whether the concessionaires will be able to fulfil their contract. The electric light installation at Bahrain, a much wealthier town is not yet running at a profit, and it is improbable that the Kuweit venture will prove more successful. °. -Pilgrims from India :- On the 4th Pecember, the rolilioal Agent, iuweit whilst touring t;.e Southern frontier of ^uweit in the vicinityvicinity of Has al ,aliya, came upon three British Indian mendicants walking in a southerly direction with the object of mating Jubeil approximately 180 miles away. On questioning them, they said they were making for I ecca. They were very cheerful and possessed no money or papers of any sort and said that the bedouins had so far been Kind to them. They said that they had walked respectively from Barisal in Bengal, JCera Ismail khan on the In, us, and Nushki in Balcchistan. They had marched for the main part along the iersian Coast from Karachi and had already taken 4 to 7 months on their journey. They refuses to be persuaded to return to Kuweit. The chief danger to be faced by them in moving down the Ha*a Coast is packs of wolves. The above is mentioned as an item of interest and to show to what length the Indian Moslem will go to attain merit. d. Visitor from the Royal House of Held :- On the 1st December two junior members of the Royal House of Hejd, Fahad bin Tuni al Saud and his brother A^dthaar visited Kuweit accompanied by 5 tribesmen of 1 urra, and after staying for two days informed the Shaikh of Kuweit and Al Nafisi (Bin Saud’s Agent) that they were returning to Hasa - when one day out they doubled back on their tracks and made for Zubair and Basrah. This occasioned some concern and was at once reported by Al Nafisi to King Bin Saud and Bin Jaloui. e. British Interests :* On the 19th December, 1931, Mr. Cox and Mr. Tate, geologists of the Anglo Persian Oil Company limited, arrived at Kuwait from Basrah by car via overland route4 route.

They intend to visit Ras al Arth, Funtas, Jahara, Jilaat al Abid, Mudaira, Batin, Al liyah, Bothatain, Bubhaihiyah, Grain, Burgan, Wara, Failaoha and return to Abadan on the 14th January. f. Foreign Interesta :- Russian Trade The sale of Russian matches and piece goods appears to be on the increase with the coming of winter. Russian matches bear on one side a design of two cro sed Union JacKe, with a suitable English super scription and are sold at the remarkable price of 16 boxes for one anna. They are popular. Russian piece goods are also equally cheap, and are of good quality and superior to Japanese articles of the same kind. No Russian steamers are allowed by the Ruler of kuweit to touch at Kuweit, but the above goods are brought in from Mohamaaerah by dhow. g. Wreck :- On the 17th December a large dhow bound from Fao to Kuweit with a cargo of dates waswrecked near i Ras al Zor, 60 miles south of Kuweit. The Political Agent who was touring in the vicinity was able to afford some assistance to the shipwrecked crew. 119 * BRITISH NAVT :- H.M.S. 'Kmerald* and H.k.B.

Borne oil has already been met with, but it i is 'dead oil' and is no indication of a workable supply at the connect depth. They have halted at 950 feet, to allow the piping to be cemented off, but the first attempt was a failure, the water present in the bore hole is- creating difficulties.Great progress has now been made with the Chaftadiyah, making a journey of 140 miles. The object of this tour was to find cut the movements of Ahdur Bahman bin MUharib, Bin Saud^ frontier official, and more especially to enquire into his activities inside the Kuwait border. Incidentally also the camping ground of the Kuwait tribes was located. On the 27th November he again proceeded to Qasr al Abid to examine traces of oil seepage on the sea shore there as reported by Major Frank Holmes.
