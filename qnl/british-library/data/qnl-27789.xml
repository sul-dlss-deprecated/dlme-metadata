Hill, Assistant Secretary to the Government of India.Gymkhana Club New Delhi, 22-11-37 Dear Hay, 2IAUA2- We have applied for a prospecting licence over the Jebel Mehdi area, of which the Western part is in Muscat territory and the Eastern part in Baluchistan territory, the dividing line between the western end eastern parts being uncertain as the boundary has not been demarcated. 2. Watts told me yesterday (a) that Sir Aubery Metcalfe had said on 20-11-37 that he could see no objection to Watt’s menti ning the matter to the Sultan (b) that since the Sultan was leaving on a world tour on 30-11-37 it might be wise to arrange something before that but (c) that before we couIgC actually negotiate wi tb the Sultan he (Watts) would require the sanc tion of the India Office, and he therefore suggested (d) that I should today cable my London Office asking them to get in touch with the India Office and request the latter to cable the necessary sanction to Watts, 3, I should not be worried about any of this were it not that last week, in Quetta, Colonel i arsons said definitely that applications for the eastern part of the same area could not now be considered, as consideration of any «uch application would automatically raise the question of the undemarcated boundary between Muscat and British territory and he ikBXBfwxax thought it most undesirable that this question should be raised at the present time. The question/-quection of the boundary would preauaably bo raised just as much by an application to the Sultan for the Western portion as by an application to Baluchistan for the east- ern portion, and before taking any action on the lines of paragraph 2(d) above 1 should like to bo assured that such action would not meet with the disapproval of the Govern ment of India* 4* 1 ought to add that ?attB is under the impression that I am today cabling London on the lines eug ested by him* It was only after further consideration of the implicatioxia and possible consequences of this action that 1 decided that I ought first to put the matter before your Department. I tried to get Watts on the telephone this morning to let him know that I was doing this, but failed, b. I attach a copy of &amp; letter received a few days ago from the Resident, feraian Gulf, indic&amp;tin that the correct procedure now is an approach to the India Office in Iondon. If I do not now cable, such an approach will pree urn ably oe made by our London Office in a week or two - but by that time the Sultan will have left iiomb&amp;y. Yours sincerely 3d/- W.&amp;* Abraham.Xlo.797-3 of 1937 Britieh fteeidency i Consulate-General, Bushire, tlie 5th tfoveaber, 1937. Jabal~i*^6X101 Area near Gwadur.

Please refer to my telegram No.2828 of the 27th November and connected correspondence regarding oil concessions at Gwadur, ending with your letter to the Agent to the Governor- General Baluchistan No.F.o64-N/37, of 30th November 1937. The next step will he for me to inform both Companies ohat obey may submit applications for concessions through the Political Agent (see paragraph 5 of your telegram No.2326 of the 27th November,; but as the Sultan has now started on ms world tour there is no urgency about this and it may be preferable to defer doing so until we have the result of your enquiries about the boundary question (see paragraph 5 of your telegram 2309 of the 25th November and your letter tc Baluchistan of 30th November). if tne^e should appear to be a serious difficulty about the boundary the communication to the Companies would be suitably guarded. As regards the suggestion however in the last sentence of your telegram of the 25th November, would it not be sufficient, instead of expressly telling the Companies that 'Government may eventually be compelled by existence of the boundary question to withhold their approval of any agreement reached', to say merely that 'they may submit applications through the Political Agent on the understanding that any concessions granted by the Sultan will be subject to/to the approval of Hi s Majesty's Government H . Such approval is required by the terms of the oil undertaking given in 1923 by the Sultan’s predecessor (see Aitchison Vol.11 - Part III - No.XX). Itwill in any case he desirable to make the communication to the Companies subject to this understanding, and if there is a difficulty about the boundary question this would then be one of the factors to be considered in due course in arriving at a decision whether to give approval.

INDIA OFFICE, v/KITEHALL TEHALL, S.W.l. January, 1938 Sir, With reference to your letter of the 5th January I am directed Toy the Secretary of State for India to inform you that there is no objection to the Bum ah Oil Company, as one of the Companies interested, entering into negotiations with the Sultan of Muscat for an oil concession in respect of His Highness’s territory at Gwadurj provided that the application to the Sultan is submitted through the Political Agent, Muscat, and that the latter is kept in touch with all stages of the negotiations. I am to add, however, that the Sultan is under an obligation not to grant permission for the exploitation of oil v/ithin his territories without the approval of Government, and that consequently any concession obtained by the Burmah Oil Company in respect of the enclave of Gwadur would be subject to the approval of His Majesty's Government. The latter, in deciding whether to grant or withhold such approval would have inter alia to take into consideration the difficulties arising in connection with the boundary between His highness’s territory and the State of Kalat which has not been demarcated. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, Managing Director, |jhe Bunnah Oil Company, Britannic House, Finsbury Circus, E.C.2.The Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf presents his compliments to ''he political Agent, Muscat. and has the honour to transmit to him a copy of the undermentioned documents (x). ” ' r iCrt IV H, British Con-ulate-General, BUSHIKE.

Quetta, 3rd Februfiry 1938* Dear Hay, Will you please refer to your demi-official letter No.F.621-N/37, of the 28th Jamary 1938. Owing to his absence from the State I am unable to consult the Khan personally, but judging from a conversation I had with him just before he left I should say that he would be glad bo agree to a meeting with the Sultan, and to the inclusion of the Political -Agent in such a conference. From his side there could be no loss of dignity, as Kalat has 19 guns against Muscat's 21, while Muscat is an iddependent Principality. I would suggest however that (a) the azirs of each State should be included, (b) the meeting should be on neutral ground, e.g. at Karachi, and (c) a very careful agenda should be drawn up with the idea of arriving at some definite conclusions. Finally I rather doubt whether any conclusions will emerge unless a salis appointed by the Government of India can preside at the meeting. Yours sincerely, Sd/- O.K. Caroe. To Major W.R.

I You will remember that last November I failed to arrange for sanction for negotiations to be obtained from the India Office in time to take advantage of it while His Highness and you were in Bombay* 2. The sanction of the India Office has since been obtained and I therefore now enclose a formal request to His Highness, through you, for an option over the area for five years* 3* As regards terms, you will remember that when telephoning to me from Bombay just before your departure last November you indicated that the terms which I had mentioned to you in Delhi, namely Rs* 50uu plus Rs* 500 a month, were considered by His Highness to be much too small* Could you give me any indication of the terms which His Highness would be disposed to accept? % difficulty in offering much larger payments is that the area is so small, and you will see that to make things a little easier I haveasked for the whole of Gwadar instead of only a specified portion thereof. Even then the area involved is less than a twentieth of that of the Dhofar concession, and on this analogy payments should I suppose be only a little more than half of those noted above* However the matter is a small one, and hardly worth any very protracted negotiations, and if you think it would lead to an easy settlement I would be willing without further discussion to double the former suggestion, i.e* make it Rs*lU,UOO plus Rs. 1000 a month. Perhaps you would consider the matter, and when you have an opportunity discuss it with His Highness,2 and let me know what you think, 4* We have been informed that any arrangement arrived at would have to be referred to and I assume that payments for the option would begin only if and when the approval of H.M.G, had been obtained, M£jor R.P, Watts, Political Agent, MUSCAT.ao.C/47/21C of 1938.

Dear Mr. Ballantyne, Many thanks for your letter of the 28th April and for ^our kindness in keeping us so fully informed of your negotiations witn the Sultan. We are now consulting the Government of India and are accordingly unable at the moment to express any comments on the terms of your draft concession. Pending receipt of the Government of India’s views I should like to remind you of our desire, which I conveyed to you when you called on the 27th April, that your Company should not conclude any agreement or sign any undertaking with the Sultan until the terms of the concession have been approved by His Majesty’s Government. If at any time we should feel called upon to modify our attitude in this matter we will not fail to notify you at once. Now that the Sultan has left this country we presume that the discussions with him will remain dormant until he returns to Muscat, when they can be resumed (the Political Agent can then be kept in touch in accordance with our letter of 31st January last).

Sultan x x x x I dir Trenchard Fowle then referred to the negotiations Will.oh were taking place in London with Kis Highness for one grant oi a concession in Gwadur, and said that here toe His Majesty’s Government considered that the concession would require their approval. They had so informed the Companies. it was explained to the Sultan that a particular reason for this stipulation in the case of jGwadur was the absence of a definite boundary between : ! f Gwadur and Kalat. It would be essential to demarcate the frontier if an oil concession were to be operated. The Sultan agreed, and was willing that when a concession was granted the matter should be discussed and arranged between him and the Government of India (not between him and the i\han of kalat). But there was no immediate need for it. Because of this obstacle of the necessity for the approval of Government he had decided not to proceed with the negotiations with the Burmah Oil Company and Indian Oil Concessions Ltd. He professed not to be disappointed if there were no oil Concession in Gwadur (or in Muscat) and if no payments were made to him. He added however that of course he was entirely free to give any concessions he likei in respect of minerals (not o il), since Government could no - point to any undertaking in ^thcTt^respect.

Our comments are r&lt;s follows:- (a) Clause 17 in B#0.C f s letter - The Company should only be allowed to transfer its rights with the concurrence of Sultan . In Article 22 of the I.v. j’s agreement Mse such words as •subject to his approval of its constitution* &amp;i$it be added. (b) The B#C.C f a letter contains no provision for termination of toe agreement by the Sultan. Such a providion adfiould be Liduded. It ^ understo d th^t the only sanction that can be enforced in the event the breach of a concurrent agreement between His Majesty’s Govern- ®«it and a Company obtaining a concession is the termination by the 3altan of the agreement between himself and the Company concerned. It *aeo8 desirable that, if possible, any agreem^mt should contain a clause which would permit of such termination by the sultan, thou^jh tou may be difficult if, as appears to be the case, the Sultan refuses to take official cognisance of ai^y agreement between Hia l&amp;jesty's floumment and the Company. ^ It is suggested Vh*t any agreeffiont should give the Sultan ta) a right of pre-emption, and (b) the ri^dit to assume control of works etc. in tu© event ox warProspecting Licence and lining Lease'. 4. It is p re spumed that provisions to ensure that the Company working the concession will always be mainly British - Of Clauses 18 and 19 in Part 711 of the Standard Form of Mining Lease - will, if possible, be included in any agreement between the Company and His Majesty’s Government. A point which we omitted to mention in our telegram 6. Nol6il dated the 14th May 1938 is that we consider it undesirable that different Companies should be operating in the amll Gwadur enclave and the adjoining portions of Kalat territory. The position with regard to Kalat is that both the Burma Oil Company and Indian Oil Concessions Limited wish to obtain concessions. It is necessary for the latter Company to obtain a certificate of approval and it has not yet been decided whether this should be given to them or not. In any case it may be a long time before a concession is granted by the Khan of Kalat to either Company 1 It mi^it perhaps be suggested to the Sultan that he should wait and see to which Company a concession is granted in Kalat before coming to a decision himself. The issue of the above has been authorised. Deputy Secretary ent of India.1 L \ V! fj \ // CONFIDENTIAL.

(ii) He drew attention tc the fact that royalty on Ban was not mentioned. I said that we would b5 prepared to pay this at usual rates on gas solute but pointed out that there was practically no prcppect of a market for gas. He appreciated this. (ill) He did not agree to the clausa that the con cession could oe tirmsferred to any Company. He caid ne nigtit definitely object to certain Companios entering his territory. I advised that we were quite prepared to make it any British Co::ipany. fliis appeared to u'.tiafy him.

(v) In response to a query from him I advised that tiie payment of -/4/- par ton (clause 14) covered only stores imported by die company for its own use and for the use of its employees for their own use. I agreed that neither the company nor its employees could sell to outsiders anything duty' free under this clauso.

Dear Gibson, As Jarrett is away, I am writing in reply to your letter of the 19th May (P. 2 . 3424 / 38 ) about the Gwadur Oil Concession. 2. The Admiralty considers it very desirable that the uv/adur Oil oOxicession should go to the Burmah Oil Company rather un i! oo the hctli.-American (and presumably .American controlled) Indian oil Concessions. We have, however, no special comments to make on the terms oi. the two Companies* offers, exceot that Article 17 01 the Burmah Company’s offer in their letter of the 28th April enables the Company to transfer their concession to ’’any other company” and Indian Oil Concessions appear to ask for similar powers in the preamble to their draft, in which the term ’’company” is stated to include their ’’heirs and assigns”. re think that at least some definite provision should be made in the Political Agreement to the effect that transfer would be conditional on the assent of H.M. Government, and would prefer that similar provision should be made, if possible, in the concession itself. ^s regards the Burmah Company, it would presumably be stated in the .political Agreement that consent would be given to transfer only to a British company, and should the concession go to Indian Oil Concessions, it should be possible to stipulate that British interests shall be maintained at at least the strength ( 50 %) which they apparently have to maintain to satisfy Indian law, and that transfer will not be permitted to any company with less British interest. 3. le have no objection to the procedure for the exchange of Political Agreements between H.M. Government and the Companies, which is being adopted for Muscat, being foilowed in this instance. rt/ Gibson, Esq., India Office, S. !. 1.PETROLEUM DBPARTt.IEHT I j.4129/1936 • 859/4/3- (Fanes Depart me nt), Dean Stanley Street, Millbanlc, London, S. 1. 1. 13th June, 1938. My dear G-ibson, \i r itli reference to your letter of 19 th May No. P. Z.3424/38 regarding the terms of the Burmah Oil Company's letter of 28th April, and the draft Concession enclosed with Ballantyne’s letter of the same date, it is rather difficult to comment satisfactorily on the merits of the respective proposals at this stage, as the Burmah Oil Company on the one hand give only a brief outline of the heads of an agreement together with the financial terms which they are prepared to agree to, while Indian Oil Concessions Limited have produced practically a complete form of Concession Agreement (which follows fairly closely the other Commercial Agreements in the Persian Gulf) but without the figures, so that it is not at present possible to compare the financial terms. On the whole the offer made by the Burmah Oil Company is a reasonable one and compares satisfactorily vvith the finane j.^ 1 terms ofother agreements in the Persian Gulf area. Considered in relation to the area to be covered by the Concession however, the financial payments will be on the high side, as I understand that the available area in Gwadur is likely to be only, a small one when the boundary is finally demarcated. I notice that under article 7 of Ballantyne's Draft the Company may ’’declare'' when it has found crude oil in 'commercial quantities'. I mentioned to you in my ietoer of 2?th nay regarding the Bahrein unallotted area tlat I diol^-.^d inclusion of a clause relating to the payment of certain sums to/ h Gibson, ,so. , ^Office,to the date of the achievement of 'commercial production' at a specified rate. Although no specific production figure is here mtuiuioned I see no necessity for any 'declaration' of 'commercial production' as an alternative to a declaration of intention to tahe up tne mining concession. The latter is quite sufiicient and the financial consequences are identical in either case. Yours sincerely, (3d.) p. c. Starling.FOREIGN OFFICE, 8.

Bear Mr.Gibson, I refer to letter P.Z.3034/38 of the 4th May. Mr.J.P.McCulloch, the representative of Indian Oil Concessions Limited, is at present at Karachi where he is in touch with Lt.Col.Sir T.C.W.Fowle, K.C.I.E., C.B.E., the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and with the Sultan of Muscat and Oman. Mr .McCulloch has been given permission by the Political Resident to continue with the negotiations between Indian Oil Concessions Limited and the Sultan and, as I understand it, to conclude them upon a provisional basis before the Sultan leaves Karachi, which I am told he intends to do on the 10th July. Mr .McCulloch has received from his Company all necessary instructions to proceed, including the following instructions, namely:- (1) To use the form of Agreement, copies of which you have and which, for identiiication, are endorsed with the date 28.4.38. (2) To avoid altering such draft excepting to fill in the monetary terns agreed upon in the blank spaces provided for the purpose and, if necessary, to fill in the blank spaces in Article 25 witn 'the President of the Permanent Court of International Justice at The nague. n (3) To make the Agreement conditional for its effectiveness, on the consents thereto being obtained from the Government of India and the British Government, the Clause to oe added at the// o U 1 2 . the foot of the draft for this purpose, reading as follows:- ’•The foregoing provisions of this Agreement are conditional upon and shall become effective only as from the date upon wiich the Sultan obtains approval tnereto as provided for by the Agreement between the parties referred to in the letter dated 21st Jamadi I, 1341 (loth January, 1923) from Taimur bin Faisal to Maj or Rae, H.B.M.Consul, huscat , it being understood that the Sultan will obtain such approval with all reasonable despatch.” The Political Resident has asked Mr.McCulloch whether the foregoing Clause emanates exclusively from the Company or whether it has received the sanction of the India Office. The Clause has not, of course, received the sanction oi the mdia Olfice, and with a view to enabling negotiations to proceed to a conclusion, I should be glad if you would tell me that you have no objection to such a conditional Agreement being concluded on the basis of the Clause I have quoted above.

I’roposed Oil Concession in Gwadur.I have the honour, in accordance with the instructions of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf that I should keep you informed of the progress of our negotiations with His Highness The Sultan of Muscat and Oman in regard to a concession over his territory of uwadar, to forward herewith a copy of my letter of date to His Hignness and of the draft form of contract referred to therein. I would particularly draw your attention to the final clause of the draft contract in which it is stated that, in the event of a dispute, if either party fails to appoint an arbitrator within 60 days of being called on by the other party so to do, the appointment of an arbitrator to fill the gap devolves on His Britannic Majesty's Consul at Muscat and that in the event of the arbitrators differing, an Umpire whose decision shall be final, shall be appointed by His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Muscat. I have used the title 'Consul' in this Clause rather than 'Polit xcal Agent' in the understanding that it ms the most diplomatic course to refer to this side of your office in the presence of or in dealings with His Highness. I hope you will find this clause in order and acceptable to you.OIL CO., LTD. 2 :~ P. O. Box 272 KARACHI.

We drew your attention to paragraph 5 of that letter when you were in London, and you said you thought it would do no harm for Watts to approach the Sultan orally and tactfully and consult him tentatively on the suggestion that it might be as well for him to postpone coming to a decision regarding the concession until he sees which company gets the concession in Kalat, pointing out the inconvenience of having two different companies operating in adjoining areas. You added that though the Sultan might refuse, you did not think the approach would do any harm. If you are still of tlis opinion would you please ask Watts to act accordingly.

Subject* Gwadur Oil . , \&lt;A&lt; V ' Reference^ Memorandum Ho. C/783 of 14th October 1938. 2&gt; A t an interview X had with the Suitan yesterday he informed me, of hie own accord, that he had in the last wee* of October resumed negotiations with Indian Concessions iimited. He mentioned that he had recently received a letter from Mr. Me Culloch from Karachi offering certain terms for tHe Cwadur concession and suggesting that he be permitted to come to Muscat to discuss natters perse.iaUy. The Sultan went on to say that he hao replied to Mr. Ma Culloch's letter making certain suggested amendments to the terms offered and adding that he preferred to wait and see what reply the Company would make to his letter in order that he could , ur Me CSlluch came to Muscat to talk consider the situation, before .&lt;.r. mc iuu.u a over the negotiations. The Sultan did not volunteer any information regarding the details of the letters exchanged between him and Mr. *cCUQch, so of course I did not enquire about them. ^ „ + of the Suitan himself having raised the 3. Taking advantage ol uie duau***. \ in Gwadur I put forward to him, on tue subject of oil concessions in (awaaur * p z 6457/38 of 7th October lines indicated in India Onioe 1938, the suggestion of the advisxtfVW) his ^^poning coming to a decision until it was seen which Company got the concession in s. 44 . (Designation) iCalatKalat. The Sultan proinii3ed that he would consider the matter but* in my ©pinion, ths question which will outweigh all others with hiir is that of the financial offers finally made by the respective companies* As you are aware there are in Muscat only two real problems, one the Oman and the other finance. If the latter can be put on a really prosperous footing the Sultan believes that he can settle the former - the great ambition of his life (ride paragraph 5 of ay letter 5o. C/145 of October 19th). 4* Presumably both companies, if they can get an inkling of each others bids, would be willing to give almost identical terms so, in my opinion, if His Majesty^ Government consider that it is really desirable that the concession should go to the Burmah Shell rather than Indian Gil Concessions (Vide first sentence of paragraph 2 of Admiralty letter of 27th June 1938 which formed an enclosure to India Office r.Z.4480/38 dated 2nd July 1938), this fact should, if you see no objection, be clearly intimated to the Sultan. As you are aware His Highness, where his own interests are not very adversely effected, is generally quite ready to comply with any parti cular desire of His Majesty’s Government and I think that if he was aware of th£tf?wish in this matter he would eventually grant the concession to Burmah Shell provided their terms approximated closely to those of Indian Concessions. 5. The Suite.n asxed if it would be possible for Indian Concessions .Limited to be instructed to give a written state ment to him as the Burmah Oil Company to the eltect that their offer for a concession was made on the understanding that any agreement between the Company and the Sultan would be con tingent upon the approval of His Majesty’s Government, Such a statement, the Sultan declared, was just what he wanted to Bake the situation between him and the Company and their respective relations in the matter with His3 - Majesty’s Government quite clear before any aGreement was signed.

Subjecti- GWADUR QIX. Reference / mv 99 correspondence ending with my express letter No C-158 v dated 4th November 1938. 2. I have succeeded in obtaining from the Sultan a copy of the latest Draft Agreement he is negotiating with Indian Oil Concessions Limited for the Gwadur Concession and forward a copy thereof as I thinic it will be of interest. 3. The Sultan informed me that he had embodied in the draft terms which he was prepared to accept for a concession. He said that under Article 2 of the Draft Agreement the Company^ last offer was Es 50,000; he was now demanding Bs 75,000. Under Article 4 he was demanding Es 2500 per mensem vhi^Le une Company had offered Ks 2000/. Under Article 6 the highest figure offered by the Company up to now was &amp; 150,000 while he wanted Es 200,000/. 4. The Sultan said that the highest offers so far received from the Burma Shell Company ( with whom however he had not yet resumed negotiations) wtt&lt;36for the heads corresponding to Articles 2, 4 and 6 °f Indian Oil Concessions Limited Draft Agreement, Es 50,000, Es 1,500, and Es 100,000 respectively. On receipt of a reply from Indian Oil Concessions Limited (Signature) His S. 43. (Designation)His Highness said he would then on his return from Dhofar in the middle of January reopen negotiations with the Burma Shell Company a nd see what offer they were prepared to make. * formed a distinct impression from the Sultan that he was inclined^© long as their offer was suitable , to grant the concession to the Indian Concessions Limited. He stated that since tney were first to open serious negotiations with him they had a sort oi prior claim over the rival Company. There is obviously something more in it thajt' such an unsatisfactory explanation but up to the present I have not been able to discover what is the real reason for his preference. My own idea is that it is to a large extent accounted for by the difference in personality and negotia ting ^technique' of the rival Company^ representatives with whom the Sultan has come into contact. 6. I obtained a verbal assurance from the Sultan that when he had finally decided to which Oil Company he desired to grant a concession he would infoim me of the fact for communication to you and obtaining the agreement of His Majesty’s Government. 7. Reference paragraph 3 of my above quoted express letter. The Sultan told me at this interview that he had thought over carefully the suggestion that he should post pone making decision in this matter until it was seen which of tiie two rival companies obtained the concession for Kalat. The Sultan declared that so far as he could judge the sole advantage in having one Oil Company holding the concession in both territories would be for the Kaiat State. Gwadur, His Highness pointed out, possessed the port and if oil should by chance be found near the boundary it would be certainly inconvenient to get it out oi the Kaiat State unless the pipe-line traversed Gwadur territory, whereas no such difficulties would arise should a similar situation arise for the Company working in the Gwadur enclave.

I am of opinion however that any disadvantage that might arise from this would be more than offset by the fact of a British company obtaining the Gwadur concession. 5. Political Agent’s paragraph 5. Indian Concessions Limited have been reminded that any concession they obtain from the Sultan is contingent upon the approval of His Majesty’s Government, vide India Office letter Ko.P.Z. 3074/38 of 4 th May 1938, and Ballantyne’s reply of 6th May. Since the Sultan has definitely asked that fciitf Indian Con cessions Limited should be instructed to give a written statement to the above effect I certainly think we should comply and I suggest that they be informed accordingly.

Luscat for infonriation*,z.8035/33 India Office, V/hitehall , S.W.l. 19th December P 1933 v Dear Starlings We sent you on the 9th December (India Office letter No. P.Z.8035/38) a copy of an express letter dated the 26th November from the Political He si dent in the Persian Gfcilf on the subject o-. n oil Concessions in Gv/adur. ^ \&gt;\1 2, You will have seen from, it that; as. suggested by the Government of India (paragraph 5 of ©depress letter dated the 27th June ? copy sent to you on t&gt;e 4th July under cover of India Office letter No. P.Z.4666/36), the undesirability of having two rival companies operating side by side in Kalat and Gv/adur has been pointed out to the Sultan ? to whom it has been suggested that before giving a concession in Gwadur he might wait to see which company is successful in Kalat. 3. Powle now expresses the view that any disadvantage that might arise from the operations of rival companies in Gwadur and Kalat would be more than offset by the fact of a British Company obtaining the Gwadur Concession; and suggests that the Sultan might be informed that if there is nothing to choose between the terms offered by the two companies Bis Majesty/ .C. Starling Esq..; Petroleum Department, Dean Stanley Street, 8NMajesty’s Government v/onld naturally prefer the concession to he given to a wholly British Company# 4. This suggestion would however face the Sultan with a dilemma ? since ? as I understand from Ballantyne ; Indian Oil Concessions Ltd. have been promised concessional rights in the adjoining territory by the Khan of Kalat, though the details of the agreement have not yet been finally settled. We should therefore be grateful if you could let us have your views (a) on the opinion expressed by Bowie; and? if you agree with his view? (b) on his suggestion that the Sultan should be told of His Majesty’s Government’s preference. In view of the action already taken in pursuance of the Government of India's view of the undesirability of having two companies operating side by side in Gwadur and Kalat? we shall also require their views before orders are sent to the Political Resident. 5. We think that the governing considerations in this case are first that we should not on the grounds of nationality try to influence the Sultan against giving the concession to the applicant whose terms suit him best financially» (especially as Muscat finances are none too good)? and secondly ti,at it would be inconvenient to have different neighbouring Kalat territory. concessionaires in Gwadur and3. The host course therefore seems to he not to address any ^mmunication go the Su±tan for tnc moment hut to ascertain from tne Govcrninent of India whether the Khan of Kalat has yranted or is likely to grant the Kalat concession to Indian Oil Concessions Ltd. or to the Burmah Oil Co. o. The Political Agent ? Muscat, in the enclosure to Powle's letter, refers to the Admiralty view that it is very desirable that the Gwadur concession should go to the Burmah Oil Company. I understand that the service consideration is less the nationality of the controlling interests in the Company than the need to ensure that the Company’s products are subject to rights of pre-emption by Government, the former being of importance in so far as control over a purely British Company is more secure. Prom the Admiralty standpoint there may not be so much to choose between the two Companies competing in Gwadur, since Indian Oil Concessions Ltd. is legally a British Company, registered in India, and will be required, if it gets the Gwadur concession, to enter into an agreement with His Majesty’s Government which will cover the matter of pre-emption. Ballantyne is aware of this, and assures us there will be no difficulty about it. These considerations might be taken into account/account in deciding whether the Sultan should he given a lead l &gt;in favour of the Burmah Oil Company notwithstanding the disadvantages, such as they may he, of having another Company operating next door to Gwadur. 7. I should add that it scorns possible that the matter v/ill be decided by purely financial factors.- since we nave baa some indication that the Burmah Oil Company are not disposed to improve or. their present offer and will t..us probably be outbid hy the rival Company. 8. I am sending a copy of this letter to Jarrett at the Admiralty and Eyres at the Foreign Office. Yours sincerely s • &lt;3g«t) i. P.
