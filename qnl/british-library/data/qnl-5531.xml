The costfo# Muscat is the same as that approved by the Additional Chief Engineer, Central P.W.D., but there is an excess of Rs. 8,080/- in the probable cost for Kuwait due to additional units recommended. This excess can be met from savings in other posts. (h) The scale recommended has been made in consideration of extreme climatic conditions in these places and also m considera tion of similar provision made by the British and American Oil and other Commercial.

In January 1936 the Government of India put forward a proposal that H.M.G. should hear half the expenditure at Bahrein and Muscat (P.Z. 833/36 and 7103/36). In November 1937 they followed this up with more general proposals regarding the incidence of diplomatic and consular expenditure in the Gulf as a whole (P.Z. 7846/37). Their proposal was that the financial liabilities of Vl'*' the Government of India Invirrw^rin Iran and the Persian Gulf should be stabilised at a lump sum contribution (for an initial period of 5 years) equal to half the approximate average expenditure^which they estimated at 9 lakhs. This proposal has not yet received the • sanction of the Foreign Office^or the Treasury. Since their original proposals for halving the cost of the Bahrein Agency whenever additional expenditure on the Agency has been necessary, the Government of India have written to us urging that the Foreign Office should be asked to recommend to the Treasury that the expenditure should (retrospectively) form part of the general ’proposal for the division of expenses (taking it for granted^that is / that the proposal would be adopted). These occasions have been in connection with:- (1) The appointment of a Medical Officer on the ^rucial Coast (Coll. 30/133. July 1936). (2) The reorganisation of the Bahrein Agency Office (Coll. 29/82. September 1936). (3) The provision of new servants quarters at Bahrein (Coll. 29/87. March 1937), and (4) Expenditure on water-borne sanitation for (6610) Wt.25956/235 10,000 9/38 A.&amp;E.W.Ltd. Gp.685 i the/the Agency at Bahrein. (Coll. 29/83. P.Z. 6708. Septemher 1938)• On these occasions we have written to the Foreign Office in the sense requested hy the Government of India, hut no reply has, ever been received from the Foreign Office^ On the contrary they have ' reiterated their opinion that the question must await a settlement of the general position as regards expenditure on the Agency. As regards this settlement the last letter from the Foreign Office on the subject, dated 17th March 1939 rejected the Government of India 1 s proposals and put iorward counter proposals wherebv ::. -.G. should assume all responsibility for posts in Iran without any contribution from India, v/hile the Government of India should assume responsibility for all expenditure on posts on the Arab side of the Gulf. (jZ They pointed out that if this scheme went through, they would no longer be concerned with expenditure the nev/ Residency, wnich would be a matter for discussion between the Government of India and the Treasury. They were therefore quite logical in their letter of the 4th April 1939 (P.Z. 2157/39) ? on the subject of the cost of providing new water-borne sanitation at Bahrein, in saying that tne question was a matter for consultation between the India Office and the Treasury. This Department has been less and less inclined to take the part of the Government of India in these mat uers and now that the Foreign Office have put forward counter proposals, there seems no reason for continuing to do so at all. Most of the items of expenditure have been trivial in amount but absolutely necessary* Oft en they are in need of urgent sanction, and v/e have little time in which to consider the Government of India’s A applications. It seems absurd that the Government of ~ ..*/ ... 0 \\r r' ', — r f 1 . (Mj Minute Paper.

It seems to allow the Government of India to believe that we can sanction or have sanctioned expenditure in this sense as they appear to do; we have simply said that we agree that it would be a good thing if it were so sanctioned and have drawn the attention of the Foreign Office to this without ever securing the Foreign Office’s written concurrence. It is suggested therefore that out of consideration for the pressing needs of the Political Agent, Bahrein, in respect of his verandakroof, a telegram should be sent to the Government of India sanctioning the proposed expenditure but committing ourselves to nothing more than observing the Government of India’s proposals for the incidence of this expenditure.

The present and the proposa.1 are explained m the Government of India’s letter of the 16th Ja.nuary 1936. There is a very strong case indeed for urging H.M.G. to accept this proposal. The Department, as will he seen from the previous minutes, has felt sane doubt on political grounds about putting forward the proposal, in view of the danger that the acceptance of a moiety of the expenditure by H.M.G. might give the Foreign Office (who do not always see quite eye to eye with this Office) a rather stronger voice in the determination of policy in this part of the world. But after demi-official consultation with the Government of India, Foreign Department, it is not felt that [}] this danger should stand in the way of our supporting the Government of India’s proposal. It should also be borne in mind that expenditure at Koweit is already shared between H.M.G. and the Government of India, whereas in practice in dealing with Koweit affairs the India Office is always regarded by the Foreign Office as being the ’’senior partner”. The Department has also been reluctant to deal with the matter while the question of transferring the Bushire Residency to Bahrein was still in the air (see Mr.Walton’s note on P. Z. 1535/36). But considerable progress has been made with this question; it now appears evident that the transfer is likely to take place in two or three years, and as regards staff it is contemplated that the Assistant Political Agent should be retained after the transfer but should eoneon-tpate upon Qatar and the Trucial Coast, the increasing/increasing importance of which will demand the services of \ i A A rtau'trlri a whole time European officer,^ 1 &lt;Cfc PtUkd /kf'W- In these circumstances it is proposed to approach the Foreign Office forthwith.

It now appears almost certain that this transfer will take place within a comparatively short period and this fact adds force to the i Government of India's contention that ^Bahrein is becoming more and more a focus of imperial interests, which now overshadow in importance the local relations and internal affairs of the Sheikhdom. 0 ' 5036 3 ./i ri«**Mi 3, -Hi R-LorAshap trusts that Kr.jSden will agree with the Goyernment of India’s appreciation of the situation and that as a result he will be prepared to recommend to the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury the acceptance of the Government of India’s proposal, which JnLio Lorgfrsl'iip~ warmly supports. It will be seen that the present total expenditure at Bahrein is in the neighbourhood of Rs. 1,18,000 per annum and that the share of H.M.G. would be in the neighbourhood of Rs. 59,000 per annum, against which should be set off a moiety of the annual revenue of the Agency, which during the three years ending 1953-34 varied between Rs. 21,243 and Rs.17,801. At Muscat it will be seen that the expenditure (including the Zanzibar subsidy of Rs. 86,400), of which it is proposed that a moiety should be borne by H.M.G., ranged during the years 1932-33 to 1935-36 between Rs. 150,400 and Rs. 154,400. 4.

Sir, I am directed hy the Secretary of State for India to refer to the letter from the Government of India dated 16th January 1936, of which a copy was sent to the Foreign Office on the Pz 6 th February, Ho.833/36, regarding the division of expenditure on the Political Agencies at Bahrein and Muscat. 2. ^LSreT^^land agrees with the | Government of India that for the reasons stated in their letter, there is a strong case for the acceptance : by H.M. G. of a moiety of the ; expenditure at Bahrein (including^the j fracial Coast) and Muscat. His Lordship has not hitherto put forward the proposal for Mr. Eden’s consideration in view of the somewhat indeterminate | position regarding the proposal to transfer the Residency from Bushire to Bahrein. It now appears almost certain that this transfer will take place within j a comparatively short period and this fact adds force to the Government of India’s contention that Bahrein is becoming more and more a focus of imperial interests^which now overshadow in importance the local relations and internal affairs of Bahrein.2. 3« His Lordship trusts that Mr. Edeh will agree the Government of India's appreciation of the situation and that as a result he will he prepared to recommend to the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury the acceptance of the Government of India 1 s proposal^ v/hich His Lordship warmly supports.

Vie certainly did consider this aspect, but as you know we are constantly being pressed by the finance Department to achieve something in the direction of a partition of expenditure between His Majesty's Government and the Government of India in this area. We find it impossible to obtain their consent to any recommendation for increased staff in these agencies, unless at the same time we press for some such arrangement, and,as you know,work in Danrain has increased to an extent which makes it absolutely necessary to have more superior and ministerial staff. You will find in our letter of Jany. 16th 1936 further arguments for this point of view and we do not see why even if His Majesty's Government contributes a moiety of the expenditure as proposed, the arrangements made in 1933 for using the India Office as the channel of communications need be disturbed although this Department very much prefers that arrangement, I have little doubt that the Finance Department -would be only too w J p.ecd. pql tm. r rsaJ 2 OCT 1936 jlND .. OFFIC willingwilling to sacrifice it, if, they could transfer some of the expenditure^which they at present incur at Bahrain and Muscat and in this resoeet they would certainly have the Public accounts Committee of the Legislative Assembly entirely on their side. Although therefore we do not wish to weaken your position vis-a-vis the Foreign Office, I should find it quite impossible to persuade the Finance Department to revise their position by using the arguments wnich you suggest in your letter under reply. Yours ever,Gcny of letter Wo.C/69 of 1936, d-^ted the 19th June, 1936, from the Hon'ble the PolltlCfll sldent In the Persiain Gulf, to the Foreign Secretpi’y to the Government of India. ■'i SubJect:-Provision of accommodotion for the 6254 staff of the Political Resident when on tour at Bahrain. S3 o -I-ttave the honour to submit below my propo sals for providing accommodation for my staff, consisting of one Gazetted officer (either the or Under Secretary ta/the Confidential Assistant) and two clerks, while on tour with me at Bahrain. 2. Had the proposal for additional accommo dation in the Agency at Bahrain been sanctioned, vide correspondence ending with India Office telegram No.983, dated the 18th March 1936, to you it would have been possible for my staff to be accon.wOdated in the Agency. As, however, this has not been sanctioned, chiefly on the ground that the oos ible move of the Hesld ncy might render this unnecessary, it is now necessary to consider arranging eccorrmodation for then elsewhere. 3. Up to the year 1926 the Political Hesident used to proceed on tour In H.I.M.O.Lawrence. Subsequently the I.G.I.S.'Patrick otew^rt' and later a ch rtered British India fleam Navigation Company steamer were at the disposal of the Political Resident for touring in the Gulf up to the year 1932. Since 1932, however, the Resident has hod no special vessel to make his tours, which have been carried out X either by one of His Majesty's Sloops or the British India -.team Navigation Company mall service. This necessitates not only the Resident but his clerical staff st, ying on shore. Moreover the increase of work on the Arab side now nece ritates the Resident's sty at Bahrain being a prolonged one of from a week upw rds. It has been the or ctice of lateyarirs for his clerical staff to stay viith friends there toy orivate arrangement. This* however, can no longer toe done, a i their one time bachelor friends are now married. 4. In the circumstances I am left with no alternative tout to approach the Government of India with a request that sanction may toe accorded to lewse and furnish appropriate quarters in a tolock of flats at Bahrain. The rent of the quarters which I propose to lease will toe Rs.70/- per mensem, and the cost of furnishing them will amount to Rs.650/. This expenditure, of course, will only continue until either the Residency is moved to Bahrain, or a decision is taken against the move when the building mentioned in my paragraph 2 above will have to be constructed. 5. In addition, a sum of Rs.30/- oer annum will toe required for repairs and replacements of the furniture for the quarters rented, i/ly proposals thus involve a total non-recurring expenditure of Rs.650/- and a recurring exaendi* ture of Rs.870/- per annum. 6. I trust that the Government of India ill be pleased to accept the above proposals snd ill accord early sanction to the proposed expenditure. 1'he extra expenditure involved in the current year will be met as far as possible by re appropriation from savings in the budget grants of the Persian Gulf Residency.N0./.18.J- V-iC. ! tram The Under f.ecretery to the Gov n sect of *k 51« in the Por^ i£n snd i’oliticol jeo rtaent, The Hjn'ble the Politicai iesident in the Persian Gulf.

Please see Mr. Clauson’s minute at P.Z. 3383y36 on the G. of I.'s suggestion, in their letter of 16th January, that H.M.G. might bear half the cost of the Political Agencies at Bahrein and Muscat, and also my note to the U.S.S. of 12th March. If we ask H.M.G. to bear half the cost and they agree, this will almost inevitably tend to weaken the position, gained after controversy in 1933, whereby the G. of I. and the 1.0. are senior partners, so to speak, in the initiation and control of policy. Before we proceed with the matter/it would perhaps be as well to put this point of view privately to the G. of I., and see whether it &lt; affects their recommendation. Apart from this factor, it might be inconvenient to deal with this question separately from that of the transfer of the Pol. Residency from Bushire to Bahrein. H. M.G. will continue to bear half the cost of the Residency after transfer^ and half the cost of the move itself, in regard to which the principal difficulty is the hig£i estimate of the cost of building a new Residency. The present position of this question is as follows. The F.O. suggested in a letter of 7th March that the cost of building could be offset by certain economies; and even that, as one such economy the post of Pol. Agent at Bahrein might be abolished. This latter suggestion is impracticable^ but we suggested to the G. of I. that some economy might be possible by combining establishment; and also that an Asst. Pol. Agent at Bahrein itself might no longer be necessary, so that we could provide for the need of an Asst. P.A. for Qatr and the Trucial Coast without having to create an additional post for this purpose. The G. of I. have postponed/ t dFinl. Seiiv ., postponed consideration of this last suggestion of ours, but have been considering what economy can be effected in the matter of office staff, which obviously affects the question of accommodation and consequently of building estimates. The estimates for building which have $0# been prepared by the G. of I. on the basis of the accommodation in the existing Residency at Bushire come to the enormous figure of £170,000, and the G. of I. are trying to arrange with the Resident for a drastic reduction. Until further progress is made with the question of the staff required at Bahrein (which is bound up with the question of transfer of the*Residency) it seems most convenient to mark tiraewith the question of the incidence of expenditure on the Pol. Agency. We may hope to make further progress with the question of transfer of the Residency during Col. Fowle's forthcoming deputation.

The question of the division of expenditure at Bahrein dealt with in that letter will require most careful consideration. Apart from the question whether the 1.0. would be wise in putting forwarc such a plan at the present juncture, it seems most improbable that we could obtain at an early date the agreement of the T; .0. and Treasury to share the exnenditure. As you know, the question of the transfer of the Residency from Bushire to Bahrein has now been raised again, and m a letter from the F.O. discussing the latter question it is suggested that the cost of the transfer, which is an argument against it, might be offset by economies at Bahrein, and they even suggest (what seems, of course, an impossible solution) the abolition of the post of Political Agent, Bahrein. It seems clear that the question of the transfer of the Residency must have a bearing on the question, now raised by the G. of I., of dividing expenditure at the latter place/L ,J. } l &lt;^&lt;g&gt; place. ^ I would therefore propose to reply to Sir A.

POL. OEPT. -3 MAR 1936 IND.A OFFICEMinute Paper See P.S.13, pages 43/4. 3939 5000 7/35 The Government of India in their letter of the 16th January put forward a proposal that expenditure at Bahrein and Muscat should be shared equally between Indian and Imperial Revenues instead of being borne entirely (with negligible exceptions) by Indian Revenues. This arises out of Chapter 18 of the Report of the General Purposes Sub-Committee of the Retrenchment Advisory Committee I f This question is a difficult one and cannot be considered entirely on its own merits. Muscat. The Agency at Muscat has been maintained without interruption since its revival after the separation of Muscat from Zanzibar in 1861. Since 1867 the Political Agent has also held His Majesty's commission as Consul for Muscat. Muscat expenditure has always been borne entirely by Indian Revenues (with one negligible exception). Specific Indian, as opposed to Imperial, interests in Muscat affairs as a whole are, however, not very considerable and in the light of recent developments whereby the air route (an Imperial interest) passes across Muscat territory at Gwadur and a naval base is being established at Khor Q,wai in Muscat territory, it may well be said that Impe rial interests predominate. The Government of India and India Office have always, of course, been primarily responsible for the internal affairs of Muscat, but these are of comparatively small importance to us, particularly in view of the independence of Muscat, as compared with the dependence on the British Government of the other Arab States. Moreover the question of the south-eastern boundary of Saudi Arabia in its relation'to Muscat, which is the main question of importance at present existing in that/ . j iiy that part of the world, is predominantly Imperial. In all circumstances and in the light of the remarks made in the Government of India’s letter it seems quite reasonable that H.M.G. should share half the Muscat expenditure. Bahrein . The Government of India's proposal as regards Bahrein needs much more careful consideration. There is in the first place the analogy with Koweit which the Government of India mention. The Agency at Koweit was established as an offshoot of the Consulates, etc., in Persia in 1904 and on the analogy of the diyision of Diplomatic and Consular expenditure in Persia , H.M.G. were asked to share expenditure at Koweit. They eventually agreed. (Please see India Office political despatch No.51 of 30th June 1911, copy attached, particularly precis of correspondence enclosed in the Foreign Office letter to the Treasury dated 27th March 1911.) The analogy of Koweit with Bahrein is accordingly perhaps rather a dangerous one to use, since we do not want to link up the question of division of expenditure at Bahrein with the much more thorny and complicated question of division of expenditure in Persia. * The Agency at Bahrein was founded in 1900 and there was never apparently any suggestion of expenditure being divided. Bahrein with its independent position in the middle of the Persian Gulf and without any very close local contacts except with the Arabian mainland was until recent years a predominantly Indian interest, since the control of Bahrein internal policy and affairs has always been primarily in the hands of the India Office and the Government of India. But the discovery of oil, the Persian assertion of their claim to the islands, and more recently the decisions to transfer the air route and the Naval Base to Bahrein, have very greatly increased imperial interests. On the other hand, Bahrein is now practically the key point \ in the Persian Gulf and it may be worth referring in the A trnhA . (t ‘tfc cf/jfau* * (faa / 3939 5000 7/35 m Minute Paper. Department, present connection to the discussions in 1933 as to the authority which should be administratively responsible lor the affairs of the Persian Gulf. In para. 4 of Sir Samuel Hoare’s Cabinet memorandum, C.P.165/33 of 19th June 1933, the argument is used, parenthetically, that the Government of India 'find not only the men but almost all the money required in this area', and this argument was an element - even if not a primary one - in the d ecision that the India | Office should be what has been described as the 'Senior Partner' in the Middle East Organisation responsible for running the Persian Gulf. Any proposal that Imperial revenues should share Bahrein expenditure might well weaken our position in that respect. There is also the question of the Trucial Coast and Qatar to be considered. These are at present adjuncts of Bahrein (though it is possible that before long an European Political Officer may be established on the Trucial Coast, possibly under the direct control of the Resident). This is an area in which the Imperial Departments of H.M.G. are particularly interested at the present time, owing to the developments in regard to oil and in regard to the Saudi Arabian frontier negotiations, and the policy they would like to adopt is not always in accordance with that which commends itself to this Office and the Government of India (e.g. they would like to see much more interference in the internal affairs of the States than we are inclined to favour). It should be carefully considered, before making any proposal for financial changes, whether such changes might not strengthen the position of the Imperial Departments in this respect. Another point to be considered is that the position in Bahrein, Qatar and the Trucial Coast is at present in—, a state of flux. as stated above - and in the Government of India’s letter - Imperial interests have grown enormously in the last few years and on merits there is probably a very good case already for demanding that Imperial Revenues share the expenditure. But that case is likely to improve within the next year or two as Imperial commitments in the islands grow greater. The Admiralty base is in process of becoming firmly established at Bahrein, the air route will within a year be an almost daily service, the Trucial Coast will probably be opened up more and more and, particularly in regard to our relations with Ibn Saud, will become more and more important internationally. Moreover a decision cannot be very long delayed on the subject of the transfer of the Residency from Bushire: this is a question which has a direct bearing on the question of Bahrein expenditure. The actual amount of money involved in the Government of India’s proposal is not large* and it may well be the best tactics in present circumstances to wait for a little, e.g. for a year or so, before putting forward their proposal. If it is agreed that we should mark time in regard to Bahrein it may be tactically desirable to mark time also in regard to Muscat in spite of the fact that the arguments against the Government of India’s proposal are hardly applicable at all in regard to Muscat. The amount of money involved in the Muscat proposal is also not very considerable.* fhe papers are submitted for instructions. If the line taken in this minute is generally approved a communication will be drafted to the Government of India referring the matter for their reconsideration in the light of the above arguments. *The net gain to Indian Revenues is estimated at rather more than Rs.40,000 per annum. *Net gain to Indian Revenues estimated at rather more than Rs.75,000 per annum.Dated New Delhi, the Creation of the post of Assistant Political Agent, Bahrain, and the division of expenditure on the Political Agencies, Bahrain and Muscat. Sir, - . 51 *. I am directed to invite a reference to the marginally cited letters from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, copies of which were forwarded to you hy him, and to 1. Political Resident’s letter. No. , 1779-3 of 1933, dated the 30th Octoher 1933. ^ 2. political Resident’s Express Letter, ' No. 19B3 of 1933, dated the 16th December 1955.^^^ ; state that the Government of India were compelled in March 1934 to sanction temporarily the post of Assistant Political Agent, Bahrain, for a period of six months, vide copy of Government of India letter No 0 D. 311-S, dated the 12th March 1934 (enclosed). This sanction has now been further extended to the end of the current financial year, and it is intended to Peep the post temporary until such time as the question of division of expendi ture between His Majesty’s Government and the Government- 2 - of India, raised in the following paragraphs, has been decided. 2. The reasons for the creation of the new temporary post of Assistant Political Agent, Bahrain, have led the Government of India to re-examine the grounds for a revision of the present arrangement for the allocation of expenditure on the Bahrain and Muscat Agencies. With regard to Bahrain, the Secretary of State is aware that ever since the formation of the Bahrain Agency in 1900, the entire expenditure has “been a charge on Indian revenues with the exception of the headings ’suppression of slavery’ and ’sanitary arrangement’ - two negligible items which are divisible between Imperial and Indian revenues. The present incidence of expenditure has 'been questioned hy the General Purposes Sub-Coranlttee of the Retrenchment Advisory Committee in Chapter XVIII of their report, a copy of which has been forwarded to you by the Finance Department. In common with other expenditure in Iran and the Persian Gulf, the Sub-Committee have recommended the transfer of the entire expenditure to His Majesty’s Government. The Government of India are not prepared to accept the Committee’s conclusion as it stands, since the political and commercial interest of India in Bahrain is of importance and for this reason alone they think there is justification for India continuing to contribute a proportion of the cost of the Bahrain Agency. On the other hand, the transfer of the Imperial Airways route and the naval base from the Persian to the Arabian littoral and the discovery of....of oil in Bahrain itself, together with the prospects of oil discovery in Qatar, have very greatly enhanced Imperial interests in Bahrain, c*f. the arguments advanced hy the political Resident in his letter of the 30th October 1933 for the creation of the new post of Assistant Political Agent, Bahrain*, In this connection I am to enclose a copy of a letter from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, No. 887/14/226, dated the 8th May 1935, with enclosures, regarding the necessity for a post of Medical Officer for the Trucial Coast on purely Imperial grounds. It would he difficult, if not impossible, to defend expenditure on this post as a charge on Indian revenues. The Government of India have accordingly postponed action on this question until a settlement is reached on the general question of incidence of cost of the Bahrain Agency as a whole. They desire to take this opportunity of suggesting that the existing arrange ments whereby practically the entire expenditure of Bahrain is borne by themselves should be reconsidered and that, as in the case of Kuwait, His Majesty’s Government should contribute a share of the cost. The Government of India consider that a division by which one-half of the expenditure of the Agency would be borne by His Majesty’s Government and the remaining half by themselves would be an equitable basis and would recommend that this should be given effect to from 1st April 1935. The present expendi ture is in the neighbourhood of Rs. 1,18,000/- per annum..„.annum including the cost of the newly sanctioned post of Assistant Political Agent, and the share of His Majesty’s Government will he in the neighbourhood of Rs.59,000/- per annum. Against this it is estimated that His Majesty’s Government will be entitled to receive a moiety of the revenue of the Bahrain Agency, the total of which for the three years ending 1933-34 was as follows:- Rs. 1931- 32 ... ... 21,243 1932- 33 ... ... 18,167 1933- 34 ... ... 17,801 jf7 ' 3. In the Muscat Agency the expenditure ranged between Rs.64,000/- and Rs.68,000/- during the years 1932-33 to 1935-36 exclusive of the Government of India’s subsidies of Rs.86,400/- and Rs. 1 lakh, known as the Zanzibar and Arms Traffic subsidies, payable to the Sultan of Muscat. (The Arms Traffic subsidy is however being discontinued with effect from the 1st January 1936). In view of the position of Muscat with its dependency Gwadur on the Imperial Airways route and its growing naval importance since the establishment of the base at Khor ^awai it will be admitted that the maintenance of predominant British Influence at Muscat is essential to the security not only of the British political and strategic position in the Persian Gulf but also of Imperial air and naval canmunications. His Majesty’s Government already pay a moiety of the expenditure on Kuwait and there appears to be every reason why they should share the cost of Muscat equally. • • • o4« as regards the Muscat subsidies, it has already been stated that the Arms Traffic subsidy is to be discontinued with effect from the 1st January 1936 and it need not be further considered. The Zanzibar subsidy, however, is granted for friendship and faithful observance of treaty engagements and should be treated on the same basis as the other expenditure on the Agency and shared equally between His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India. 5. I am to request that these proposals may receive the favourable consideration of His Majesty’s Government and that they may be given effect to from 1st April 1935. 6. I am to add that the Government of India’s claims in respect of these two places are without prejudice to any general claim they may feel compelled to put forward as regards expenditure generally in Iran and the Persian Gulf in the light of the new Constitution.

He has already approached me with a request fcr permission to proceed to Sharjah, so that the matter is pressing. Doctor Dame and ur. Thoms have recently spent a considerable time in ^atar, where it seems probable (though proof is unlikely ever to be forthcoming) that one of them endeavoured to bring influence to bear on Shaikh 'Abdull bln Jasim al Than! in favour of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company and both talked considerably in an anti-British and pro-American strain. Doctor Dame visited Sharjah recently at the request of the Shaikh to attend a rich merchant. He was there approached by certain disgruntled persons and said that he would mention their grievance (a purely internal and personal question about an estatej to the Political Agent. This is obviously the best reply from....from his point of view, Put it would clearly Pe most difficult if an idea were to get aPout that access to the ear of the Political Agent could Pe had through an American missionary. 3. It is almost impossiPle to do anything to prevent the doctors of the Arabian Mission from bringing medical aid to the Trucial Coast or i*atar, unless we provide medical aid ourselves. 4. For the reasons outlined, that is (a) the dangers of the penetration through medical missionaries of American influence on the Trucial Coast and in Qatar and (P) the impossibility of preventing them from coming hhe unless we provide medical aid, it is, I think, essential that we should make arrangements for medical work in that area. 5. I have done v/hat I can locally by taking Assistant Surgeon R. Holmes, the Medical Officer-in- Charge of the Victoria Memorial Hospital, with me on my recent tours in December 1934 and February 1935 and tables attached to my letter No. 1791 dated the 29th December 1934 and to this letter give some idea of the valuable work which he has done at Sharjah, Dibai and Abu Dhabi. I would only add that he speaks Arabic and has an exceptional flair for winning the confidence of the Shaikhs and people, so much so that in Sharjah a number of women came for treatment without their menfolk, which is eloquent testimony to the respect in which he is held. Sven these few brief visits have had the effect of materially increasing the cordiality of our welcome. 69 6. But I only felt justified in taking Assistant Surgeon Holmes from his work in Bahrain, because it was pressingly necessary from the political point of view to start our medical work before the Americans should have entered the field. He cannot ordinarily be spared from Bahrain where the hospital and dispensary demand his full attention, and as he is quarantine Medical Officer it is undesirable that he should be long absent. 7. I have heard, through Assistant Surgeon Holmes, of a ship f s doctor of the British India Steam Navigation Company Limited, a Doctor a. Madkami, who will be due to retire from their service about the end of March 1935, but wishes for some other employment to supplement his means sufficiently to finish the education of his son. He is aged about 49 years and served in an hospital ship during the War. Assistant Surgeon Holmes has known him in the course of his quarantine duties for some years and says that he appears quiet and well mannered, and thinks that his experience as a ship f s doctor in the Persian Gulf should have familiarized him with Arab customs. He speaks some Persian and would doubtless pick up sufficient Arabic in a short time. 8. I recommend that I should be allowed to take an opportunity of seeing Doctor Madkami on his next voyage and, if he appears suitable, of ascertaining for what pay he would be prepared to serve on the Trucial Coast for a period of say three years. I understand that something in the vicinity of fts.£50/- and an house allowance of Rs.50/- a month (total Rs.300/- a month) might attract him.9. I attach a statement showing the initial and recurring cost of the medical work, on the assumption that we employ Doctor Madkarni. I propose that he should have his headquarters at Sharjah, as the Airways Station is there and it will he easy to communicate with him hy the Airway T s Wireless, hut that he should spend roughly twenty days in the month at Sharjah and Dihai and ten days a month in out stations, Ahu Dhahi, Ajman, Hamriyah, Umm-al-Qawain and Ras A1 Khaimah, and possibly later on at other villages. His movements would he under the control of the Political Agent, Bahrain, and would naturally he governed hy the season. He would need accommodation at his headquarters, for which an allowance is the best arrangement, and at other places the Shaikhs would, I have no doubt, place a room at his disposal for his work while he is at their k towns. Gorrmuni cat ions are very sketchy and means for performing journeys will he largely made available hy the courtesy of the Shaikhs and of His Majesty’s Ships and I think that the best plan is to give him and the dresser a daily allowance while they are on tour. Experience will show blether any further help is necessary. I would recommend that treatment at the dispensary should he free. There will he hut little opportunity for private practice on the Trucial Coast, hut if well-to-do people wish the Doctor to visit them in their homes, I think that he should he permitted to charge a small fee for doing so.Confidential.

Aitli respect to the expenditure incurred in connection with the establishment at Koweit, 1 am to transmit to you herewith for their Lordships’ information a memorandum prepared in this Office which summarises the correspondence exchanged on the subject between the Departments interested during the years from 1901 to 1909. It will be observed from a perusal of this paper that when the agreement with the Sheikh of Koweit was originally concluded, the late Marquess of Salisbury expressly disclaimed the intention of holding the Government of India responsible for any expenditure incurred in respect ol that place in any circumstances which might arise in the future. It appears to Sir E. Grey to be impossible, in view of this utterance which it would always be open to the India Office to quote and to which indeed they have already drawn attention though not officially, to resist the demand that half of the sum required to maintain the establishment should be drawn from Imperial sources. I o make such a demand at an earlier date would, however, have been undesirable in view of the great importance, during the earlier stages of British activity in connection with Koweit, of avoiding any action which might arouse the suspicion and jealousy of certain foreign powers, a consequence which would most probably have followed the divulgation of the fact that the Imperial Exchequer was expending a considerable annual sum at that port. Quite apart from the responsibility assumed, as above pointed out, by Lord Salisbury in 1899, it appears to Sir E. Grey that this expenditure is not only justified, but imperative, from the standpoint of Imperial interests both political and commercial. It is hardly necessary at the present time, when the subject is exciting such general and increasing interest, to point out the importance of preserving and strengthening the position which Great Britain has acquired at Koweit, since it is clear that any Government which neglected to do so, would, by relinquishing control over the probable terminus of the Bagdad Railway, certainly incur responsibility of the gravest kind and very likely cause irreparable damage to' British interests. I am accordingly to express Sir E. Grey’s earnest hope that their Lordships will raise no objection to the inclusion in the adjustment of the sum icquiied under this head and to request their sanction for the transfer to the India Office of the whole amount demanded, viz., 23,21 GL 18s. 4d., before the 31st instant, it being anticipated that this charge can be met out of savings on other Sub-heads of the Diplomatic and Consular Vote. I am, &amp;c., The Secretary to the Treasury. w Langley Memorandum. On 29th September 190-1 the India Office wrote drawing attention to the arrangements which had then been recently made for putting the Consular Representation in Persia on an improved footing and for the representation of British interests at Koweit. The India Office stated that the Government of India proposed to add to the cadre of their political establishment Political Agents at Kermanshah and certain other places in Persia as well as a Political Agent at Koweit, this latter at a salary of Rs. 1,500 a month, with a local allowance of Rs. 200 a month. The India Office observed that these Persian posts had hitherto been held by officers drawing the salaries of their military or civil rank, and that they did not know what salary was payable to Captain Knox when at Koweit, but that they presumed it was that which he drew at Bushire as First Assistant to the Political Agent in the Persian Gulf. Ihe India Office letter stated also that when the agreement with the Sheikh of Koweit was originally concluded Lord Salisbury had stated that “ he did not contemplate that by according that assistance theIndian Government would in the slightest degree pledge themselves to take any action or to accept any liability under any circumstances “ that might arise in the future ; ” that the appointment of a Political Agent was a direct consequence of that agreement, but that as regarded the particular expenditure therein involved the Secretary of State was willing to accept as a charge on Indian revenues a moiety of the cost of the Agency, so long as it was considered desirable to retain it. The Indian Government also proposed to have an officer in reserve to fill any unforeseen vacancy in Persia, at a salary of Rs. 500 per mensem. The India Office letter concluded by observing that the monthly cost of these proposals, ?.e., that for the expenses of Koweit and the other posts above referred to, was estimated at Rs. 6,300 a month; the actual cost of the then provisional arrangements being Rs. 3,000 a month. This matter was referred to the Treasury on 1st ^November (1904), to which Department it was pointed out that the proposed salaries were somewhat higher than those considered necessary for the Levant Service, and that the additional expenditure would amount to about 2,640L a year, of which half would be payable by the Imperial Government. The Treasury in replying on 28th November 1904, commented on the increased cost of the Consular Establishments in Persia which they had in the past accepted without comment as being the result of British policy in Persia. But they observed that the motive of the present proposal was stated to be to improve the Consular Representation in Persia and that it was proposed to pay the officers involved in the scheme at a higher rate than the Consular Officers in Persia under the Foreign Office. In view of these facts-, the Treasury trusted the Secretary of State would see his way towards reconsidering the scheme submitted. This letter was referred to the India Office on 10th December 1904. I may here remark that there appears to have been a misunder standing between the India Office and Foreign Office as to the character of the Agency at Koweit. The Government of India wanted to make the appointment permanent, but, in consequence of Foreign Office objections, it was decided to continue the practice of deputing an officer to Koweit from time to time from Bushire. It appears from a letter from the India Office of 22nd February 1905, that steps were then being taken for the temporary withdrawal of the Agent, Captain Knox. On 11th March 1905, the India Office communicated to this Office a despatch from the Government of India enclosing correspondence dealing with the probable cost entailed by deputing an Agent to visit Koweit periodically. The India Office observed that the pay of the Agent amounted to less than that at which it was estimated in their letter of 29th September last (1904), and that the question of including'in the cadre of the Indian Establishment the officers appointed to Koweit and the other places referred to in that letter had been referred to the Government of India. The Government of India observed that the Agency at Koweit would involve an annual recurring expenditure of Rs. 24,843 on Establishment, Rs. 4,689 on other services plus an initial outlay of Rs. 5,500. (Details were set out in the enclosures in the India Office letter.) A copy of this letter was sent to the Treasury on 23rd March 1905, with the observation that it did not appear necessary to deal with the matter pending the receipt of a detailed report from India. On 19th June 1905 the India Office communicated a copy of a Despatch from the Government of India, showing certain modifications which, in the opinion of Colonel Knox, might be made in the items of expenses of the agency. This communication was minuted : “ When we know the details we shall be asked to bear half the cost.” In their letters of 17th January and 22nd February 1906 the India Office called attention to the desirability of the Agent at Koweit being provided with a steam launch, as well as of the acquisition of certain rights over a piece of the foreshore. The India Office mentioned also the question of coaling facilities. On 3rd April 1906 the India Officeasked whether the Imperial Government would defray half the cost of the steam launch (1,606/. 136*. 4d.). This letter is minuted: “ 'The “ question of sharing expenses at Koweit is still before the Treasury. “ This should go to them.” In reply to their inquiry the Treasury was informed, on 21st May 1906, that Sir lid ward Grey concurred in considering that the Agent at Koweit should be provided with a steam launch, but that the question whether we should pay half its cost must depend on the question of the incidence of expenses then before the Treasury. On 29th December 1906 the India Office transmitted a Despatch from the Government of India enclosing a revised statement of the expenses of the Koweit Agency, which compared with those of 1905 as follows :— Annual Allotments as reported in 1905 t Annual Allotments as modified. Establishments, Ks. 24,843. Establishments, Ks. 33,585. Other services, Ks. 4,689. Other services, Ks. 9,272. Initial expenditure, Ks. 5,500. Initial expenditure, Ks. 24,087 'll. The India Office urged in this letter that the supply of a launch had become a necessity and enquired whether the Treasury would sanction half its cost without prejudice to the general question of the incidence of the expenses of the Agency. In their reply of 26th January 1907, the Treasury commented on the increased expenditure on account of Koweit reviewing briefly what had passed on the subject. They said that before considering the question of the purchase of the steam launch they would like to hear what was recommended as regarded the other items of expenditure. The India Office, to which Department this was referred, observed in their letter of 26th February 1907 {see Eile 3191) that they took note of the fact that the Treasury had admitted the principle of equal division of cost as regarded Koweit. They explained that the increase in the expenditure was owing to (1) the higher pay of the Agent owing to the reorganization of the Indian Political Department, and that this was unavoidable if an officer of the standing of the then incumbent was considered desirable, and (2) the cost of the establishment of a Camel Service. The India Office expressed themselves as not knowing why the Government of India had sanctioned it, though they considered such a service desirable. The India Office letter observed that the question of the launch was of special urgency, and they hoped the Treasury would treat it as a separate matter. This question was referred to the Treasury, which Department stated in reply on 16th March 1907, that they were not satisfied as to the necessity for incurring any expenditure on account of the launch. Hereupon the India Office on being informed to the above effect telegraphed (in April 1907) to the Government of India that this decision put an end to the proposal. In the meanwhile the question of Koweit was assuming increased importance, and on 21st September 1907, as the result of strong repre sentations, the Treasury agreed to pay 2,000/. per annum, being half the amount of the (perpetual) rent of a piece of land on the foreshore. The Treasury also agreed to pay half the cost of the launch. On 11th October 1907, the Treasury agreed to pay their share of the rent in advance. On 8th March 1909 the Treasury was furnished with a copy of a letter from the India Office stating that the final cost of the launch was 3,801/. 9s. 4c?. and enquiring whether the Imperial Treasury would agree to pay half this amount. On 17th March (1909) the Treasury consented to pay the moiety (he., 1,900Z. 14s. 8c?.) on this account, and on 5th August 1909 the Treasury agreed to pay 191/. 12s. per annum, which sum represented half the cost of the crew.

With reference to your letter of 3rd March last relative to expenditure on Diplomatic and Consular Services in Persia, I am directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to transmit to you, to be laid before Viscount Morley, copy of a letter from the Treasury on the subject, together with copy of the reply which I have caused to be returned thereto. I am also to transmit to you copy of a statement of expenditure in 1909-10 in Persia, and at Chiengmai and Xakawn Lampang, showing, as compared with expenditure in 1908-09, a net decrease in the claim on the Government of India of 8530 10s. 4d. in Persia, and an increase of 7180 0s.

I have laid before the Lords Commissioners of 11 is Majesty’s Treasury Mr. Langley’s letter of the 27th instant (7904/11), and the enclosed copies of letters from the India Office showing the amount of the expenditure due from Imperial Revenues in respect of expenditure in Persia, &amp;c., in 1910-11. In reply I am to express their Lordships’ regret that they should now be called upon to defray arrears of charges in respect both of Koweit and Meshed for several years previous to that (1908-09) upon which the Imperial contribution for 1910-11 is based. As Secretary Sir E. Grey is aware, my Lords have never specifically sanctioned any expenditure from Imperial funds on the cost of maintaining the Consular establish ment at Koweit, nor, for years previous to 1908-09, on that of the Military Attache at Meshed. In the former case in fact my Lords had stated reasons why the full amount claimed by India should not be paid from the imperial Exchequer, while in that of Meshed a protest had been made by your Department against imposing on this country any charge in respect of the appointment of a Military Attache, and, although ultimately the appointment was approved in 1908-09 for two years, my Lords were never asked to defray any portion of the expenditure incurred previously to that date, and never in point of fact have agreed to such a course. My Lords are not clear moreover why these claims should have been deferred to the present date. The fact that repayment is made to India in the form of a lump sum should have been, they would have thought, a sufficient safeguard against publicity, and in any case the share of the rent of the foreshore at Koweit was included in the contribution paid last year. In any event they consider that these questions should have been raised separately rather than included in the claim presented at the close of the financial year, the estimates for which included no provision for this expenditure. In these circumstances it appears to their Lordships that they would have good ground for refusing in both cases to meet the claim preferred by the India Office, at any rate during the course of the current and ensuing financial years. Upon a review, however, of all the circumstances and in deference to the representations of the Secretary of State, they are not disposed to take this course, and they are willing that the excess 11142. Bcharge which is involved should be met from savings on other subheads of the Diplomatic and Consular Vote. As regards the remaining details o£ the amount (which, my Lords note, is calculated at 23,216?. 18s. 4d.) payable to India, my Lords must leave it to the Secretary of State, as in previous years, to satisfy himself that they include no items uncovered by previous sanctions of this Board, and that they form in all other respects a proper charge to the year 1908-09 in respect of which the present contribution is to be made ; and they sanction the proposed transfer on this understanding.

In reply to your letter of 31st March last, relative to expenditure due from Imperial revenues in respect of expenditure in Persia, Ac., Ac., in 1910-11, 1 am directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to observe, for the information of the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury, that some misunderstanding would appear to exist upon the question of the expenses of the Military Attache at Meshed incurred before 1908-09. The letter from this Office of 18th December 1905, which forwarded copy of a letter from the India Office of 13th December 1905, was, to a great extent, an argument in favour of the Imperial Government sharing the cost, and in the Treasury letter No. 1417 of 25th January 1907, this expenditure for the Military Attache at Meshed was included among a number of other proposals which were accepted by their Lordships so far as they had already been carried into effect. I am to add that the letters from this Department of 21st September and 31st October 1908 were intended to refer to past expenditure as well as to a further period of two years, and that, in view of the previous correspondence, the Treasury letter, No. 18,943, of 11th November 1908, was assumed to have sanctioned the expenditure already incurred.
