Dear Sir: I am enclosing herewith an exact copy of the Certificate covering 35 empty oxygen and acetylene cylinders which The Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited returned to P. R. Behring Co., 89 Broad Street, New York City, U.S.A., on December 17, 1935, and an invoice for which was certified and forwarded to me under cover of your letter No.2243-5/3 of December 18, 1935. P. R. Behring Company in their letter under date of March 10, 1936, writes:- 'As you are aware, the invoice certified by the Political Agent at Bahrein is used in lieu of the usual American Consular Invoice; therefore, it becomes an official document when clearing the cylinders thru the New York Customs House. In order to be accepted as such, it must bear both on the face and on the Revenue stamps the official seal (or rubber stamp) of H.B.M*s Political Agent. Unfortunately, on the above mentioned shipment the Seal was not placed on the face and was placed on the reverse side of the invoice only but directly on the stamps. After the entry had been passed it had to go thru the Liqui dating Division and while thru this routine it appears that some 'Stamp Collector' removed the stamps with the seal as well which has made this invoice void as far as the Customs are concerned. Therefore, in order not to have to pay Customs Duties, it is now necessary that you kindly send us another invoice identically the same as the original one on which the Seal (or rubber stamp) must be shown on both the face and reverse of the invoice. 'In order to avoid qimilar difficulties as above, please show the Seal as you have done on shipment of 41 empty oxygen and ace tylene cylinders per S.S.'BARP3TA' from Bahrein on January 27th, your TBB-747. This invoice has the Seal on the face as well as on the reverse side. When placing such Seal on the reverse, please make sure that half of the Seal is on the Revenue Stamps and the other half on the Invoice so that in case some 'Stamp Collector' removes the stamps, it will still indicate that the stamps were originally affixed.' March 28, 1936.Will you kindly certify this and future Invoices in accordance with the request made by P. R. Behring Company. Please return the invoice, duly certified, and debit me with the cost of certification. Yours very truly, G. W. R. SMITH, Chief Local Representative, THE BAHREIN PETROLEUM COMPANY LIMITED.

Dear Sir, Cases have occurred in which members of the sta 'f of the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited have brought documents, already signed bv themselves, on which they wish to have their signatures attested. 2. It is impossible to attest such sijtnatures as the Political Agent has no means of knowing that the signature is actually that of the person bringing it. 3. It would be convenient if you would kindly warn anyone who may bring such documents for attestation in future that he should not sign the document except in the presence of the officer who is to attest his signature. Tcere is, of course, no objection to the document being otherwise filled in; indeed, that should be cone beforehand in order to save time. 4. ' I would also suggest that, in view of the time taken by a visit to J.fanamah from the Pew Camp, it would be sound for persons wishing to have documents atteste- to telephone beforehand to make an appointment. It is possible that someoines all officers may be awayaway on duty else /here during office hours and a previous appointment would prevent possible disappointment and waste of time.
