Possibility^of an Oil concession^in ASIR.P^ROI&amp;UM SfAMLOT STKS&amp;f, S.W.l 30tii May, 1934. Dear Warner, I enoloj® herewith a brief note of a talk I had recently with Jans on, who ms sent on to me by Farrer, regarding the possibility of an oil concession in Asir• On the receipt of Foreign Office printed lottor of the 13th July, 1933 (E.3804/487/25), I wrote to Cadraan who informed me that axrangertents had been made for Longrigg to see Fuad as Ryan suggested * But I gather from a recent inquiry I made of Fraser that nothing Tory definite has happened up to the present. I was careful not to give Janson any indication of that line H.M.GoYornrjumt might take if we were asked to support the Eastern &amp; General Syndicate. He merely seemed anxious to keep himself right with us by letting us know what is going on. I may mention, although I did not record it in the note of the interview, that Janson appeared to wish to justify the Syndicate in what they had done in regard to Bahrein and the other Gulf areas whore at one time they held some kind of concessions. He stated that they had done what they could to interest the Anglo-lereian Oil Company, and said that at one period (about 1925) the Anglo-Pereian Oil Company had taken an option from the Syndicate in regard to certain of the areas. He inquired whether I would bo interested to have a precis of the correspondence, etc. I replied that if he cared to send it to rae 1 would put it on record# Subsequently he rang me up to say that he had found on reference to hi© £Qes that the /nglo-Persian Oil Co ipany had not in fact entered C.F.A.?^arncr, Esq., into/ FOBS!OH OFFICE, S.iflLl , P.3.3&amp;31/1934. 0^ 235/9into any definite arrance sent, which t&amp; what I un&amp;mtood to be the c&amp;ae. He again offered to send me a note, and I thanked him* But nothing has so far reached me* fhis is to some extent wrapped up with the activities of the Arabian Berelopraent Syndicate in the Sfeutral Zone, and one of these days we may have to let Hyan have our views on the Bos tern &amp; General Syndicate and their frfends in relation to their activities in Saudi Arabia. I merely pass this information on now for your own use, and am sending copies of this letter to Laitfcuvaite and Seal* Tours sincerely, (ID.) F.C.STABLIKG.Mr. E.W.Janson, ox the Eastern &amp; Gkmaral Syndicatej had an intex'Ti 0 » with Mr* Starling on bl&amp;y 18th # 1934, and oaid that khe Syndicate were taking an interest in the question of obtaining oil concessions on the .Vostern side of Arabia and had boon told by Ibn Saud that he would be prepared to grant the Syndicate a coneisaion in respect of Asir. Ho believed that the Standard Oil of California wore also interesting themselves in tho matter, and unless something was done quickly by a British Company, the Standard Compan;/ was likely to take up this concession. He had neon the questions raised in Parliament recently about Bahrein, ar;d it night be inferred from those that the Syndicate was in some way responsible for that concession going to the Americans. He thought, therefore, that lie ought to lot the Petroleum Department know about the Asir proposition. Mr. Starling said that Ibn Saud^ territory waa in a different position from that of the Sheikhdoms on the Eastern coast of Arabia, where the British Govornmont had to be consulted in connection with the grant of concessions. The British Government wore naturally desirous that British oil compa/ie© should take up oil concessions wherever prospects seemed at all favourable, but Mr. Starling said that he could not do more than take note of what Mr. Jancson had told him.4 /^'\ The Political Agent, Bahrain* Memorandum* I beg to report the following for your information* i 2* I heard recently that abojit the month of December 1937, the geologists of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company visited SAFQ(or SAFUK as shown on the map). According to enquiries made by me they went in their motor cars to BA , AJAH which is on the sea about 14 miles north-north-west of SAFQ and about two miles west of SILA 1 * From this point the geologists are said to have proceeded to SAFQ Wells and camped there. Few days later the said geologists received instructions from His Majesty King Bin Sa r ud that they should move from that place and had also prohibited them from using the coastal line ror the road going to SHA* through the MI JAN. King Bin Sa»ud, however, permitted them to work in the MANAYIF(not shown on the map but according to my informer is adjacent to the MIJAN on the west side). The geologists then moved their camp to AT-TARFAH which is abodt six miles west of SAFQ.

(E 3816/438/25) No. 1272/84/29, BRITISH LEGATION, JEDDA, SAUDI ARABIA. 13th June, 1938. My dear Baxter, The Jedda manager of California Arabian Standard Oil Company, Lenahan, gave a very optimistic account of the Hasa oilfield two or three days ago. He described it as richer than that of California. He said that the expenditure of a sum of five million dollars up to the end of 1938 had been authorised, and that a refinery would have to be built in Hasa as the one at Bahrain was only sufficient for local purposes. ell No. 7 had been shut down, as there was nowhere to put the oil at present. These statements were made to Day, who, as manager of Gellatly, Hankey and Company (Sudan) Limited, represents the Shell interests in the Hejaz, and they should perhaps be discounted a little, as Lenahan may have been trying to scare the Shells Yours ever, Sgd, R.W.
