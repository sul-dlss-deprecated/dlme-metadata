The arrangement followed ae to incidence of the increaeed cost has been that India should meet the cost of the pre-war strength of the garrison at present rates * subject to the above contribution of £72,000 . while cost of ^additional forces maintained there (described loosely and not altogether accumtsly as cost of Aden operations) has been met in equal shares by India and His Majesty's Government.

He consequently proposed that India should make to the Middle Sast Department an annual contribution of a lump sur. for a .jc- o. yea.e tc com her share in uie coat of Aden and also the services which the new Department will perform in safegiarding Indian interest in Arabia generally. Mr.Churchill originally suggested £500,000, but Mr.Montagu subsequently agreed to place a figure of R 8o 50 lakhs before the Viceroy and the Indian Councilo This figure corresponds roundly to the cost of Aden to the Government of India in the current year as mentioned above; and may be said to assume broadly that while some reduction in this figure may be caused by economies in the present Military expenditure, this saving will be set off eo far as India is concerned by her assessment to some portion of the liability in respect of the contemplated subsidies.- etc. In consideration of this contribution of Rs.SO lakhs the new Department would? th iiiite?y c ^V.i f i a s i si;fr u&lt;,n of (b) g^b.Ur.^n.ibimy for ^y ,ub„di., (c) relieve India if desired of the cost of the Administrative Establishments on the Arabian littoral of the Persian Gulf (d) undertake to do all that is possible to protect ^ + 1 ?, ter n est8 ln A r abia aB well as to consult the Government of India in all important points of policy. If this arrangement were adopted the Treasury would pav to the India Office direct the £28,000 which though included in the present contribution of £100,000 towards Aden really represents a part of their contribution towards the cost of the India Officeo Under this arrangement India would be relieved from allfuture claims to bear a share in any new expenditure due to developments in the policy of His Majesty 5 s Government in Arabia., On the other hand p the amount of contribution would be open to reconsideration after 5 years, it being understood that India would then be entitled to a revision of the figure to give her the advantage of any economies or savings found possibleo Lord Reading was personally prepared to endeavour to obtain the agreement of his Council to an annual contribution of £250*000* but not to go furthero This figure Mro.Churchill is not willing to accept as adequate and has stated that he will not agree to take over Aden on these termso If this decision is adhered to it will apparently result in a reconsideration of the provisional decision as to the transfer of Aden 0 It is understood that the Secretary of State now desires an official reply to go to the Government of India a telegrams of 11th April and that this should go before Council 0 A draft is submitted; it is suggested that the most convenient course will be for this to be considered by a Committee of Council. 16/3/21, 2c Minute bv I venture the following remarks with much diffidence especially as I fear that their general tenour may not help much to promote the ready acceptance by the Colonial Office* in its present mood? of full responsibility for Aden • a consummation devoutly wished by this Department at any rate 0 In the hope that it may be of some use I venture to suggest one method of building up a total contribution oy in-iia which amounts to a sum not very different from that g^ven by Lord Reading in the private file as his maximumo Before the war the average annual cost militarycivil was about £200:,000&lt;• Towards this expenditure India received a contribution of, nominally, £100^000; in fact of £72 c 000 (plus £28 3 000 which went towards the cost of the India Office)o It seems to be assumed by all parties that the India Office will still receive the £28,000 whatever happens, and it may therefore be omitted from further consideration 0 Before the war therefore India paid approximately 5/8th and Imperial Revenues 3/3th of the cost of Aden 0 Assuning for the moment that Aden is to be left after all as an appanage of India, can it be believed that India will be content with a contribution of £72,000 a year as representing the importance to the rest of the Empire of this strategic point? Surely she would demand that the contribution should be increased proportionately to the increased gross cost 0 and assuning that the annual cost of Aden is taken, as MroChurchill takes it, at £466 £) 0C0 0 would demand at least 3/8th x £466,000 (i 0 eo about £175,000)o And this would, in the light of the events of the world war r be a very modest requesto For thou^i the discussion now in progress is proceeding on the basis that it is merely a matter of bargaining whether India or the Imperial Government retains control of Aden, it should not be forgptten that when the test of war was applied it was found r^cessary to transfer this control from India to the Imperial Governmento Prom this it seems fair to infer that the respective interests of India and the rest of the Sfcpire in Aden are not as 5 s 3 but rather as, at most, 3 : 5; and that if India were to demand a settlement on the basis of the i and £ division which was in f&amp;e' the section of the Report ) recommended by the Welby Commission containing their final recommendationso ) she would be making a very reasonable demando This would amount-, in present circumstance to an offer by India to contribute £230,000 annually for five years or soo The Secretary of State for the Colonies however will not look to an offer to contribute less than Rs o 50 lakhs say x€ CT «9* ssy £335 000 ' in return for which he will give India quit in respect of any other Arabian expenditure in the object of v/hich India has an interest Lord Reading is not prepared to beyond a total contribution of £250,000 and (thou^i be does not seem to have arrived at this total by the process sketched nere, it. may be taken, for the purpose of argument that the 00 ' represen 'other interests* in Arabia beyond This brings us to the Arabian subsidies, The Chief ok these - t th&lt;; last two firsto ’ benevolence of thece Chiefs must be secure safetj of Adem With all respect, I do not follow this Subsidies to I argument Q I bake it that the strategic value of Aden lies ir its situation as a jaav&amp;l base from which to block or keep open S the Southern end o the Red Sea? and that we keep a garrison &gt; prevent it being seized from the sea or bv landa It is agree that India should contribute to the cost of the garrison which secures this base? but if the policy of the Colonial Office is to reinsure the garrison against having to justify its raisqr^ _ d° fibre. I do not see why India should be expected to contribute to this re^inauran.:® also ~ which is what the subsidising of these two chiefs seems to amount too (I do not overlook the fact that in pre-war days Turkey was the potential land-assailant of Aden, and that Turkey was kept in hand by diplomatic pressure by His Majesty's Government; ut India did not contribute to the cost of this weapon and may chim to be excused from contributing to the cost the ins ' uent by His Majesty 3 s Government to fill the vacuum c by the elimination of Turkey) 0 • It —12? •9 1 * J 3 It is urged that as the Indian Moslems cpnstitute some 30% of'the pilgrims performing Haj every year Indian Revenues Subsidy to the King of the ) should contribute pro rata to the subsidy Hedjazc * -—- without which King Hussein cannot « adequately cater for the pilgrimso It seems to be admitted that the King does lay out money on behalf of the pilgrims; it seems to be equally admitted that none of his outlay benefits the pilgrims s but only his own subjects who act as raiddlemenc And I understand that it is the impossibility of controlling expenditure of money inside the Hedjaz (quite apart from the religious issues involved) that has induced the Government of India to limit their expenditure on the Haj to expenditure outside the Hedjaz o Moreover, it seems clear that Hi a ?• ment intend that King Hussein ; s subsidy should be used, not merely to finance him as caterer for the pilgrims ? but also to defray the cost of military measures, designed to protect his territory 8 and for general administration,, in the s it wo. division^ in the light of the foregoing considerations, that her ff contribution should be limited to one third of a half of the vide aasuised proportion of Indian to subsidy, i c eo other pilgrims,, ■ x # The subsidy to Ibn vide various usee to be made of the ;* , , • ■^subsidy, &gt; Saud 5 it will be rscembered is &amp; SCUQOfl ■c-'' ..5 &gt; v * &gt; • •» * * -9 ^ .,&gt;* w -: •% 93 m m &lt;• * Subsidy to Ibn Saud« ) t+%.- 1 0 * ^ m the result of Imperial War Policy 0 Its object was to enable or encourage Ibn Saud to attack the Turks or pro-Turkish Arabs o Its continuance sine* to the fear of His Majesty s Government that its discontinuance would provoke Ibn Saud to misbehave himself in many directions especially in the direction of the Ho’ r Places, but also in the direction of Koweit and Mesopotamia* In sc far as its payment constitutes a protection of Mecca and Medinareaches a total slightly in excess of the maximum that Lord Reading is prepared to lay before his Council, and considerably less than the minimum that 'Jr,Churchill is prepared to consider The Aden settlement* is in any case likely to include certain irrelerancies or illogicalities, and it mi^it be pardonable to add to their number if by so doing the gip now existing can be bridged. The Government of India have considerable misgivings, plainly expressed, that even if Aden is transferred to the Imperial Government the outlay incurred by India since August 1917 -subject to adjustment* will in fact be impossible to recover, tfould it not be expedient to make a virtue of a possible necessity and while limiting India's annual contribution to £250,000 (subject to reconsi aeration at the end of an agreed period) offer the Imperial Government a very considerable sum down by waiving further recovery since 1917? If this proved insufficient, there is yet another make-wei^it that could be offered; viz? the aacunts paid out by India on account ox Ibn Baud’s subsidy in excess of His Majesty s treasury s sanction, between July 1917 when the period sanctioned expired and some indeterminate date in 1920 when attention was orawn vO the flatter 0 This sum amounts, I think, over £260,000.

Some oi these charges are at present divisible between Home and Indian Governments, but in order to secure complete • ‘?paratior. of Indian charges from charges of new Department.whole of Koweit charges would of course be paid by new Department, The new Department must be responsible for all expenditure in this area due to policy that it pursues. We must therefore ask that it be recognised as a condition of proposed arrangements) that, while we shall allow new Department to utilise the services of our Political Officers in the Gulf free of charge, no charges shall fall upon Indian Revenues, except such as Government of India has sanctioned of their own motion for the purpose of their local administration, and that any expenditure incurred under the orders, or at the request, of the new Department shall be paid by that Department, Our military expenditure in this area is limited to provision of guards for Political Residencies, end our naval expenditure to payment of £100,000 to His Majesty 0 s Government for the general naval defence of India and protection of her trade. India also pays for cost of coal used by ships of East India Squadron, when employed in Persian Gulf, or on service of Government of India* Ihese charges also we shall continue to meet, but we must be free from any further liabilities for naval or military charges. Reference in Churchill 1 e telegram to quarantine at Camaran is ot clear* We understand that current expenses of quarantine are met from fees levied from pilgrims.

Even if -we were prepared to agree to ary liability for policy of the New Department, the Legislative Assembly would not acquiesce in any expenditure from Indian Revenues for the furtherance of a policy over which neither the Government of India nor the Assembly will have any control whatsoever, much less would it tolerable (sic? tolerate) a compulsory levy on Indian Revenues for any object such as subsidising King of the Hedjaz or other Arabian subsidies of which it would altogether disapprove. As ?eg^rds personnel, the simplest solution in case of Aden would appear to be for the New Department to take over at unce the existing personnel &amp; bloc for six months, which would give time for each individual to decide whether he will transfer his services to New Department, As regards personnel elsewhere, we are averse in principle from permitting officers of Civil Department to take up long foreign service engagements, senior officers* prolonged absence from regular line often impairs their efficiency, and causes considerable administrative inconvenience# PART ly.

I should have thought, unreasonable., Next, there is the case of Bin Baud. Some control of his activities, such as can be threatened by the power to continue to increase, diminish or withhold ms subsidy, is really a payment largely for tne protection of the Holy Places, Unless we can count on his tnendsnip, the Holy Places may at any time be threatened by bis forces. Again India is interested. As regards the Idrisi and the Imam their oenevolence must he secured for the safety of Aden, As regards Aden itself, there is no country in the world which is so interested in the security of Aden as India, Her communications are vitally affected by and pivot upon Aden, and I cannot conceive that you wcuit. endorse the view that India is not concerned to help in maintaining Aden for these reasons, Tnese considerations are to my mind conclusive, India has everything to gain and nothing to lose by treating generously the suggestions of the Colonial r iiice 0 I have not yet carefully considered the financial results of the proposals ma.de in your telegram; but ^ W0U I^ submit to you that any proposal which the ColonialColonial Office makes that relieves you of any part of your existing liability and protects you from any further cl aims 3 ought to be acceptable to you* Consider for one moment the alternative position If His Majesty^s Government come to the conclusion that the attitude of your Government is not sufficiently generous and does not admit sufficiently the iuporUnoe of Aden to India c they cj&amp;n w ithdrajy at any moment their proposal to take over Aden* The result would be that you are saddled indefinitely^ having lost this golden opportunity* with your c 0 ng&gt;lete present liaoility for Adenj that the scheme for securing economy* by joining Aden to Somali!acd would not be effected* and you would lose your share in the economieso Meanwhile* it would be my duty to make representations to you about subsidies in additioru Xt\ on the other hand* I could conclude an arrangement whereby you could see quite clearly that your total liabilities m tne Middle J&amp;ast would be lens than your present liability* and that this should obtain for a period of years* you would have gained something substantial* end might* so far as I can see* lose nothingo I do not see any alternative by which you would be in a position to gain anythingo You might* on the other hand* be saddled with your present expenditure and a liability to increases* Let me have your viewso 2o From Secretary of State to Viceroy 0 2Qth April 1921, Private and personal 0 On the ]3th ins tarn i sent you a long private telegram abodt the transfer of Aden and the money involvedo I am having a Conference with Winston on Tuesday 0 If you could oe kind enough to let me nave your views on my telegram before that, it would help me very much 0 There is a hopeful scheme floating turcv *througn niy mind about whicft I should like your opinion. I should like to refuse to give any money to Aden on transfer,, or any money to any specific purpose,, out to say to Winston your Government would like to be consulted on tnose aspects of Colonial t-ilairs whicn Biiect India,, and would therefore agree to pay a contribution to represent India’s interest in Colonial Office matters, particularly mandated areas. We are, therefore, prepared to aek the legislature to vote annually a sum of money for this purpose,, but tnis would be absolutely impossible unless all India’s grievances against the Cblonial Cxilee ( do not, oi course, refer to the Dominions} were redressed. We must be able to assure India that the Colonial Office administration is not hostile to Indian interests, and this would, of course, mean a s® • le. Qrr, of iaet African questions on the lines your Government das recomnended. What do you think of this plan? Winston wants money. We want to be consulted about Colonial Office affairs as they affect us. We want to get rid of the festering sore ir ^ast Africa« Toe Colonial Office would know that if at any moment they behaved badly, to Indians^ the legislature would refuse to vote the money 0 The sole question would be the amount.

They will be sent Mediately they arrive, probably to-morrow. 3. You will understand that ay Foreign Department finds it difficult to get into new atmospnere of negotiation hetween Winston and you and me. They remember (sic? applied) your note of 22nd December 1917, and, in view of that, thought 100,0&lt;X£ a generous offer. I pass this oy as ancient history, and only' mention it that you may understand the situation. To • deal with the narrower aspects firsts (a) Sum mentioned by Winston is considerably in ez '' 3a n; - aotja I liability now accepted by Indian revenuea 0 Uy Tr.e difficulty about payments for the King of and otners such as Ibn Saud and 1 is that it would be regarded ana cer ' &amp; ainly used by pan-Islamists, as asking Indians to subscribe money to carry out a policy which tney detest., and against which n: / /ere in persisted protest*. Of course -us situation may be vitally affected if you Bucoeed in establishing Turkish suzerainty knows •must reluctantly point out tnat it is a very diiiicult road to travel. Can Winston perform if he quite sincerely promises? Even though willing to enforce his views in Colonies or mandated areas, are not the vexed questions in many respects beyond tne powers of Winston? I say this not in carping spirit but that you may nave my views. Again, suppose some untoward event affecting Indians adversely in any such territories, there would be danger in the Council's exercise of power to refuse -ne promised contribution, and such a refusal would seriously aggravate difficulties hitherto existing between (Indians ?) and British. These are only general indications of perils and obstacles in the path you propose, and are not meant to he definite reasons of tonamedans refusing to co-operate. On the contrary. I want to help in arriving at a solution with Winston. S. i have ciecussed the whole matter now with Hailey and nave presented to him the features of the wider policy you and I have in view. In one word, he will travel all the way with us, but naturally is anxious about tne amount of money and the avowed reasone for giving it. «y notion is that the annual payment, o. lixed sum should be based on complete release irom liability oi India to contribute to Aden or the u. *..93 or oiinerwise, so that Council may perceive advantage of t ixed annual sum, even though large, over smaller sum with increased liabilities in future, I am prepared here to justify larger sura on this grounds 6. As to the amount 0 I have indicated cost is much less than 300 P 00C£* to Indian revenue, but I would be prepared to agree to 300 0 00( £&gt; ix necessary, or even to 400 i&gt; 00C£ it* you wish it and we obtain satisfactory assurances^ although I must point out 400,0(X£ was maximum Winston proposed to me at Cairo, when he could hardly“•*'**/ assent from my yiev, t w ^ /iew ‘ tiat ^is was aakii- too | * y • ' :ax • ome to terae vita Winston, 1 would urge you to have definite ascur™~ ... i - a 3 sur an^3 as regards ~~ B ® riOTano9a ( pTUoularly in Sut a-i — to .„n.t iniluence oa^ot *»««*, th . , f „ tiara=t0 „ ° “lloote queation or Iniran question of I etitus in Britisn territories s-d L ' a ''' itself t '“ d ln »»mier ooraiendin- ‘ “ Indi “ “ Brlti “ «&gt;Moo * oartrer^ and racla l equality to ,ni„ h I „ 8tri ^ , P Indian opinion 0 7.

Public men here attach great importance to report of the Welty Conmiasion, and to the arguments advanced therein against saddling India with the whole of the charges on Ader;. It must be remembered also that we shall be handing over military buildii^s worth some 60 lakhs of rupees and civil buildings valued at 20 lakhe of rupees, and the Bombay Government has already intimated that they will seek some financial settlement from us on account of civil buildings. Although, therefore, it might appear st first sight that we should not be f he losers by accepting the proposal that we should pay 50 lakh* 0 f rupees a year, yet I think it would be impossible to defend this as in any way a good bargain over a series of years and certainly would not enable us to state that we are effecting a substantial oconcrry. In view of all the circumstances, and particularly of the value of buildings which we should be handing over, I do not think that it would be possible for us to defend a subeidy in excess of £250,000 which, as the contributio, of £72,000 would cease, will be in effect a subsidy of £320,000. 1 fear that I should hare some difficulty in getting even this proposal approved by vcy Executive Counci 1 0 but I am quite confident that it would be impossible for me to suggest anything in excess of this. 4* I come now to the second point© If this arrangement is to be terminable at the end of five years e it seems to me open to the criticism that India may at the end of that period find itself saddled with complications for vsbich it has itself not been responsible, end possibly also with the payment of subsidies of a very unpopular nature* I feel strongly that the transfer, if it is to take place at all must be permanent © At the same time, in view of the considerations I have stated above, I think there would be a better chance of success here if it were stipulated that the financial effect of the transfer should be reviewed every five years 0 in order that India may obtain the benefit of any reduction that may be made in the stondir^; expenditure on Aden* 5© If5© If you can see ycirway to get these proposals acceptedp I would suggest that you reply to our last telegram officially p putting forward proposals for our acceptance. Your suggestion that we should now officially address you accepting considerably higher terns than originally proposed by us would place me iftrsonally in some difficulty. For various reasons I am not anxious to put before iqy Council, to whom the matter must be referred, all the arguments used in our private correspondence, but unless 1 do so, I should have no ground for recommending now on preeont official telegrams their acceptance of the far more liberal terms which we ore now proposing. 9 0 From Secretary of State to Viceroy, 26th July 1921. Private and personal. Your private and personal tel^ram of l?tb July. Aden. I have put Winston in possession of your views and proposal that limit of any subsidy to be given by India should be £260,000 per annum. He expresses opinion that this contribution would not be financially advantageous to British Government end should not be accepted. He points out that gross cost of Aden in present year is £466,000 and that contribution by India of £250,000 would result in charge to British taxpayer of £216,000 for Aden alone, apart from liabilitfes in respect of other parts of Arabia in which India has interest or treaty obligation. Further, if calculation is made in sterling instead of rupees, arid rupee.appreciates sibstantially in future years, contribution will be less and share of British . Government more than it at present appears on paper. Also, he understands that £50,000 will have to be found for a new station ship. On the above grounds he states that he is unwilling to take over Aden on this basis. He adds, with regard to two points raised by you, firstly, that there would be no necessity to introduce any reference to subsidies in the Indian contribution and th&amp;t it could be made in respect of Arabia, including Aden, cr even vn respect of Aden alone; and, secondly, that he contemplated hatthe contribution ehouid be reviewed after five years 0 and not that the whole arrangement should be liable to be terminated c see para. 4 of your telegramo Will you please let me know shether,, in view of Winston^ attitude, you would be willing to improve on your offer of £250„000 and whether you have any other observations to make with regard to his criticisms&lt;&gt; If we cannot meet him or. the point of the figure to be adopted, we must recognise that Cabinet may decide to reconsider proposal for transfer of Aden Imperial Government and to revert to pre-war arrangement# While this might obviate possible agitation to which you refer ir 2 of your telegram, I feel that, apart from the general considerations which I have previously put to you, it would be of substantial advantage to India to compound for her obligations in respect of Aden and Arabia generally by the payment of a fixed contribution, and I have no doubt that you also will appreciate this#1*1 10 From Viceroy,, 6th August, 1921 €3 Private and personal e Aden,, Your private and personal telegram of 26tb July,, With the beat will in the world I fear I cannot go any higher,.

Th 0 Govemmant of India aatinat 0 the military expenditure at Aden in the current year at 70 lakhs of which lakhs are marine expenditure- Thie leaves for the garrison proper 66# lakhs which, taking the rupee at Is.ddo = £443,333.

It presumably represents the minimum to which it is hoped to work down. There were at the beginning of the year in excess of the above establishment indian cavalry (since withdrawn) British and Indian Artillery (partially withdrawn) and the weak battalion of Yemeni infantry (still there). Consequently the Government of India would appear to have under-estimated the actual garrison for which provision is necessary in the current year. If the provision taken in the Army Estimates for the home government’s sht.. e of a .en garrisai is riphb then the under-estimate of the current year’s expenditure amounts to at least £150,000. Further it appears probable that they have under estimated the cost even of the establishment assuaed. Fulldetails of the way in which the total of 66± lakha ia arrived at are not available but the India Office have supplied figures which cover a Large proportion of it. Taking these figure a, and comparing them with the coat of corresponding units in Egypt as ahown by the Army Estimates and maidng suitable allowance for probable charges under Heads other than Head I. it appears that the cost of such a garrison would probably have been calculated by the War Office at not much less than £700,000. If we ^duce this figure by 20% to allow for the actual value of the rupee (le.4d) inetead of the higher value (le.ad) taken by the War Office, re get £560,000. it would be unsafe to assume a lower figure than tins for the cost of the garrison in future ^ u TOuld fce increased by a rise in the rupee. The Government of India expect still to receive the £28 r 00C which they say represents a contribution to the cost of the India Office, though it is borne on the Army Estimtes and there descried as a contribution in respect of Aden, and though His Majesty's Government now contribute a separate Grant- m-Aid of £136,000 per annum in respect of the cost of the India Office. The Civil Government of Aden about pays its way. But there are certain miscellaneous charges at present borne by the Government of India which in the event of transfer would be thrown upon Aden, and might result in a civil deficit. Aden requiree a new station ship to replace a worn out vessel of the Indian Marine. The cost of this under present arrangements will fall on India. In the event of transfer it would fall on us. The final cost of a vessel now under consideration would be about £150,000. From the above calculation it follows that, as against a present charge on the Imperial Estimates of £308,500 (on which there will jfciost certainly be a saving) there would in th«</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000833.0x00036b_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/18/B369</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x00036b</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/18/B369</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'Aden.
