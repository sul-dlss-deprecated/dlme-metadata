The extract states that the Court of Directors learn with regret of the large numbers of slaves being imported from Zanzibar into the Arab ports. The Court of Directors also acknowledge Kemball’s assertion that the best means of stifling the trade is to suppress it at sea, but up until now, the Persian Gulf squadron has not had the resources sufficient to do so. The Court acknowledges Kemball’s desire for the Company’s steam frigate
                           Queento be deployed in the suppression of the trade on the Arab coast, and asks whether this hope has been attained.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024051557.0x000066#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
