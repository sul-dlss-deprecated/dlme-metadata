I spoke to the Prime Minister this morning about the Iraqi Land Settlement Officer at Pao. He said that he had written to the Ministry of Justice pointing out that a British Officer should be appointed and would see that effect was given to his instructions. I said that it was important that no decisions should be given by the Iraqi Land Settlement Officer and explained that 1 was doing my best to arrange the secondment of Mr. Jardine in the manner that His Excellency had himself suggested. Meanwhile it would be better to suspend any woi&amp;k by an Iraqi Officer as his employment would appear to be an infringement of a written arrangement. (intd. ) B.C.N.

With regard to ('b) of your telegram. I did not discuss that matter with His Highness before leaving for the Easter week-end as I did not wish to go away and leave him with an unpleasant subject to think ahout in my absence. I need not, however, have worried for I now see that the idea is not new at all, hut has teen tried out and failed, 3. His Highness was most averse to the suggestion on the grounds that he has greater trust in, anri control over, his son Muhammad than AMulla. His Highness also thought that AMulla might act without his knowledge, and he over-inclined to study his own interests. I do not see how that could well he as all the Suhah are in the same hoat so far as the Date Gardens are concerned, hut there is something in the first ohjectlon. His Highness said that Ahdulla showed no inclination to work, hut only to talk and make helieve that he was a clever person. He gave as example of this inertia Ahdulla's half-hearted attitud.e as President of the Council, and his delegating of revenue powers entrusted to h-im to his Fahad as Salim. There is no douht that Ahdulla takes hut little interest in the Council, anri as for the delegation of his revenue powers there may he some truth in the statement for Fahad certainly sits in the 1:16 J 4eut 'Colonel C.G.Prior, CIE., so-called/ Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.-2 so-called Treasury, and iTahad and AMulla have the reputation AMulla was easily swayed, witness his lending himself as figurehead of that party in Kuwait which recently attempted to upset the established order. This is quite true, and, of course, should be home in mind when it is a question of the employment of AMulla in Basra where, I imagine, temptations are many for those persons whose work is connected with the Iraqi Courts. 4. We need not, however, enter into these questions now since AMulla has already been tried out as 'Inspector of the -• J)' 11| o ' - x ■ Sub ah Estates'* - vide de Gaury's demi-official letter No. 271 of August 23rd, 1938, to Weightman, and has proved a failure. This, I regret to say, I overlooked, perhaps 'because of the complete absence of any results during the six months in which he was ''Inspector' 1 , and this at a time when there was great activity in Date Gardens matters. It is evident that he gave up his duties on the Shaikh Ahmad's return to power, though there is nothing on record. AMulla was not directly concern ed with all tMs but it is obvious that he did little even when matters in his branch were under action, for instance Istihlak Tax, eviction of the Shaikh's fellaheen etc. Since Abdulla has already been tried out as Controller of these estates and been found wanting, I now consider that there is nothing to be gained in re-employing him. The duties and responsibilities would be even heavier than before, and it would be difficult to overrule the Shaikh's objections wMch are well founded. of acting in concert in most matters.

The requirements are in some cases Ithbat Wuratha , and in others statements of the persons in whose names property should he registered. I have a list, with which I will not 'bother you, of Good's present requirements. 3. I have not, of course, gone into details with Good as to whether all these documents are essential before the land can he registered in our favour (i.e. to safeguard the payment of compensation 'by His Majesty's Government against the guarantee) or not. I have gathered that most oi the lands are secure, and that if the documents now required are not forthcoming. Good will register the land in the name of the Subah, and leave it at that. This may 'be enough, 'but on the other hand it may not, and the essential fact for us to keep in mind, I think, is that His Majesty's Government have at last succeeded in securing the appointment of a Settlement Officer acceptable to them, and that we must see that he is not hampered in the settlement by the Shaikh. 4./ m'ble Lieut-Colonel G.G.Prior, GIB., )litical Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.-2- S1 4.

He can have nothing to say against this. With the information I can obtain from Partu (which will coincide with what Good has written) we can write to the Shaikh and tie him down to definite answers. help us in Date Gardens matters, and we must, I think, act so as to ensure a settlement 'by the present commission despite any obstructions the Shaikh can put up. 5.

Dated the 3rd April 194!• Galloway had received information that Iraq, was introducing legislation to prevent foreigners acquiring landed property in Iraq which would preclude registration of Shaikh^ date gardens and nullify settlement operations.!) -P'' Inquiry from Embassy shows that Land Settlement Law No•50 of 1932 Article 10 Section (c) sub-section li) is being amended by insertion of word 'Iraqi* between first two words with declared intention of preventing registration of land in name of foreigners in Basrah Liwa. 2. Enactment was apparently at committee stage and as a result of representations to Iraq Government addition is being made providing that 'the limitation does not include i foreigners to whom the government has undertaken to make grants of land in the Basrah Liwa 11 . This would of course place Shaikh completely at their mercy. 3.

Confidential. Office of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Camp, Bahrain. Dated the 5th April, 1941. My dear Peel, You may be interested to know the inside history of my telegram No.T/159, dated the 3rd April 1941, regarding the registration of the Shaikh's date gardens. Judge Good apparently heard a rumour in Basra that foreigners were to be prevented from registering land in future but thought the law would not have retrospective effect. However, he wrote privately to the Embassy who made enquiries and ascertained that the amendment was actually in the committee stage and shortly to become law. Up till this moment the Embassy knew nothing about it, although it struck at the root of foreign ownership of property in Iraq. 2. Holt^ who is the Oriental Secretary in Bagdad, and the only person who has any idea of what is going on, at once saw the danger and asked the Counsellor, Holman, to take up the matter with the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Apparently in the Foreign Office when you are under orders of transfer you cease to take up any more /work, so the Ambassador was unable to deal with it himself. Belt was pressed by -Hrolman to get the amendment cancelled, and ascertained privately that the addition empowering the Iraq Government to make grants was being drafted in the Ministry of Justice. 3. When Holman approached the Minister for Foreign Affairs the latter told him that the Shaikh's position would be fully protected, but when Holman asked him for confirmation of this / in ►T.Peel Esquire, G.B.E.,M,C , V . JD.JCj • , M • , The India Office, London.in writing he said this was quite unnecessary and that he would guarantee it hiniself • Holman retired with this answer which was, of course, quite worthless and did not even send a record of their conversation to the Minister for Foreign Affairs which might have the effect of tying him down. I told Holman that Taufiq Suwaidi^s undertaking was worthless and that it was a great pity that there was nothing in writing. He said rt Yes, yes, too 'bad of him was^t it ? Too bad, too bad 4. I do not think that we shall ever get the Shaii:h f s properties registered now f and am afraid we will eventually he forced to pay a very large sum in compensation.

Last year the 'Date Board' raised some difficulties about our doing this, and again this year when we asked our son Muhammad to send down fresh dates as usual for our families, he discovered that obstacles were still being put in the way. We therefore request Your Excellency to conmunicate with the authorities concerned and ask them if they can possibly arrange to let us have the M fresh products of our gardens and bring these to Kuwait for the consumption of the different members of the Al Subah, I shall be much obliged if you can arrange this small concession for us.

Sir I have the honour to re the correspondence ending with my Printed Letter Ho. 0/537-2/5 of the 28th September and to state that I visited Basra on the 29th and 30th of September and discussed the present position with regard to the Shaikh of .Kuwait's Date Gardens with his Agent, Shaikh Mohommad 'bin Ahmad as Suhah and his Legal Adviser, AMul J alii Partu. On my return to Kuwait His Highness called upon me and we examined the question very fully and His Highness asked for official advice on what line of action- he should pursue in regard to the Bashiyah garden. I % ^ informed the Shaikh that I would address you on the subject and would communicate with him immediately on receipt of your reply. 2. The following is the present position with regard to the Bashiyah, Faddaghiyah and Fao Estates:- BASHIYAH ESTAT E. On the 22nd March of this year the 10th Land Board, Basra, registered ad and eighty shares in this Estate in the names of Ali al Zuhair # s heirs and the remaining thirty six shares in the name of the As Subah. These latter shares had originally 'been purchased from their owner, Ahmad Pasha, hy Shaikh Mubarak, Shaikh of Kuwait in 1907. Abdul/AMul Jalil Partu stated that some time ago he had suggested to His Highness that an appeal against this decision should he filed in Baghdad on the grounds that the President of the Board had failed to give due consideration to the unofficial documents produced 'before him in support of His Highness * claim to the Estate. The Legal Adviser maintains that such documents when produced 'before a Land Board should carry as much weight, assuming they are authentic, as official documents. The Legal Adviser was doubtful if the appeal would succeed. I share his doubts. As regards the question of His Highness suing the heirs of Ali Zuhair for the original purchase price the Legal Adviser was of the opinion that the suit would succeed only as far as the property of Shafiqah, wife of Ali Zuhair, was concerned, one eighth of the one hundred and eighty shares, as ; when the sale to Shaikh Mubarak: took place, although Shafiaat obtained a ruling from a Shara Court to the effect that she was entitled to dispose of her children's rights in the property the actual deed of sale was not signed 'by Ahmad Pasha, the co- guardian with Shafiqah of the children who were at the time minors. I understand that the Legal Adviser considered that the decision of the Shara Court was of doubtful validity, and that the sale deed would probably be held to be invalid, as it had not been attested by both the guardians of the minors as it is required to be by Iraqi Law*. Possession of the one hundred and eighty shares of this Estate passed from His Highness to the heirs of Ali bin Zuhair in 1938. I am informed that in the event of it being decided to proceed against them for the return of the original purchase money it would be possible to obtain an injunction before the suit is filed to prevent them from selling or otherwise alienating the property pending a decision in the case. The/T SS ?..AJ)DAGHIYM ESTATE &gt; This Estate was registered in the name of the As Subah 'by the Land Settlement Court on the 21st of July although so far I have no official record of this decision. Up to now no appeal against this decision has 'been lodged as far as is known. The period of Limitation for such appeals is forty days hut it would always he possible to put forward the recent unrest in Iraq, as a ground for an extension of the period of Limitation, In fact the Legal Adviser proposes to use this very plea in the case of the Bashiyah Estate should His Highness 'be advised to lodge an appeal. TEE EAQ ESTATES . I 'understand that there are two Land Boards at work in the Basra Wilayat, one, the 8th, dealing I with the property of Iraq, subjects and the other, the 10th, | with the property of foreigners. The former Board have recently asked His Highness* Agent, Shaikh Mohommad 'bin Ahmad as Subah for proof that certain mosques and other buildings an the As Subah property at Eao are the property of the As Subah family, and Shaikh Mohommad has very properly referred them to the 10th Land Board who are fully informed on this point. 3. In the cases of the Eaddaghiyah and the Eao Estates no action is called for and I think it doubtful that an appeal will be lodged against the Land Board's decision in regard to the Eaddaghiyah Estate as long as the present change in the political atmosphere persists. As regards the Bashiyah Estate there are two possible lines of legal action neither of which seem to be at all certail of terminating in a decision advantageous to His Highness. I do not consider that His Highness would be well advised to appeal against the decision of the 10th Land Board and anaction for the recovery of the original purchase price would not only be 'unlikely to succeed against that portion of the property originally owned by the minor children of Ali Zuhair but would re-open an unedifying series of legal actions of little profit to anyone except the legal fraternity and it-4- it might result in a counter appeal against the Land Settlement Boards decision in the case of the Faddaghiyah Estate. Estate which has 'been alienated from the possession of the As Subah is in the neighbourhood of £.4,500. His Majesty^ G-overment are hound 'by the 1914 undertaking to maintain the heirs of Shaikh Mubarak in possession of this property, hut have unfortunately heen unahle to carry out their promise. An attempt to rehabilitate His Highness 'by appealing once more to the Iraqi Courts would 'be wearisome, expensive and most probably fruitless so I suggest that the only other line of action possible, in the peculiar circumstances of the case should be taken and that His Majesty's G-overnment should advise His Highness to take no further action in regard to the Bashiyah Estate and honour their obligation by paying him the present value of the property. The present value of that portion of the Bashiyah I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant. Major, Political Agent, Kuwait.55/11 Telegram 4.

Dated the 26th October 1941. My Express Letter ITo .0/278 July 9th. Shaikh of Kuwait*s date gardens. Shaikh has approached Political Agent for advice regarding line of action he should pursue regarding Bashiyah garden. 2. Two courses are open to him (a) an .appeal against decision of Land Settlement Board on ground that due consideration had not been given to unofficial documents produced before it (b) a suit against heirs of al Zubair for recovery of original sale value of land. 3. Shaikh's legal adviser is doubtful if (a) will succeed and Political Agent shares his doubts. Legal adviser considers that (b) might succeed only in respect of one heir owning one eighth of property of which Shaikh has been dis possessed and Political xi.gent considers that it might lead to similar action against Shaikh in valuable Paddaghiyah estate registered in his name by land Settlement Court. In the circumstances Political Agent recommends advising Shaikh against adoption of either course. I agree and request authorisation xkk to reply to Shaikh accordingly. 4. Present value of property of which Shaikh has been dispossessed is approximately £ 4500. - Resident.sMl' V,^ With the Compliments of H.M.'s Embassy, .cal Resident in the Persian Gulf, mSHIRE.(630/3A1) British Embassy, Bagdad. 3rd October,19U1 Sir, I transmit to you herewith a translation of a Note Verbale from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, together with several enclosures, requesting the service of a number of summonses on certain members of the ruling House of Koweit. 2. These summonses arise from appeals made against the decisions of the Land'Settlement Officer who is now dealing with the properties of the Ruler of Koweit in the Pao nahiyah of Basra and, as His Majesty^ Government here agreed that Land Settlement procedure shall be applied to these properties, there is presumably no objection to the service of these documents. 3.

(Please pass to Political Resident Persian Gulf as my Ho.34) Ho. 34 Dated 30th Hovember received Ist December 1941 I recently received from Iraq Government a number of summonses for service on Ruler of Kuwait and on members of his family.These all arise from appeals (made in accordance with Land Settlement law) against decisions given by Land Settlement Officer concerning properties in Iraq now in de facto possession of Ruler. In view of the fact that His Majesty^ Government themselves proposed the application of Land Settlement to Ruler's properties and in so doing clearly stated their willingness to abide by any modifications in decisions of the Land Settlement Officer which might result from subsequent appeals under law (pee,paragraph 12 of enclosure to Baghdad despatch Ho.358 July 15th 1936) I considered it proper to forward these summonses to the Political Agent, Kuwait I have now received from the Political Resident a telegram (Ho.T/703] which I am repeating to you in my immediately following telegram. entirely changed since Foreign Office despatch to which the Political Resident refers was written and that having agreed to Land Settlement procedure His Majesty^ Government cannot now obstruct this procedure by refusing J) &gt; ! /b' V for service My own feeling is that position has-2- to serve on Sheikh sumiQonees which are made in accordance with Land Settlement Lav/. On the other hand there would seem to be no objection to service of summons^ on legal representatives of persons concerned provided these representatives are in possession of powers of attorney transmitting necessary ( ? omi ssion ) to make such service legal. I do not think however that summons on Sheikh himself should in the circumstances be excepted from such an arrangement. I should be glad of instructions. - AMBASSADOR - NPG. 1/12.53/11.

Bashiyah Estate. 2# So far as appeal is concerned Partu originally suggested that appeal might be filed on grounds that President of the Board had failed to give due consideration to unofficial documents but v/as doubt ful if an appeal on these grounds would succeed. With this view I agree. Time limit for appeal which is 40 days in any case expired long ago and it is doubtful if disturbances in Iraq could any longer be quoted as plea for extension of period, further Shaikhs claim is admitted to be weak, decision has been given against him by British Judge and on general grounds it seems wiser to let the matter rest. 3. With regard to claim for recovery of original sale money. Appeals against registration of Paddaghiyah estate in names of the as Subah have already been lodged. This was the ^similar action* which Political Agent considered might result from claim and this argument is therefore no longer valid. Claim might succeed as against Shafiqah deceased but would almost ;certainly not be-2- fce accepted against her children. This 'being the case all the Shaikh could expect to obtain would he a isoney decree which could only be executed against the personal property left by Shafiqah. So far as is known this property is confined to one-eighth of the 180 shares in the Bashiyah estate to which this telegram relates, and is worth not iDore than about £ 220 at present r^fates. Every subterfuge would undoubtedly be used to prevent the Shaikh from obtaining possession of even this small share of the estate. 4. Total value at present rates of property of $ which Shaikh has been dispossessed is believed to be i approximately £ 1700, the figure given in paragraph 4 of my predecessor's telegram having been quoted under a misapprehension In all the circumstances explained above I strongly recommend that the Shaikh be offered the present value of the land (which requires verification) and that further litigation over this particular estate be avoided. - RESIDENT - NPG.

Date of hearing of appeal February 7th. 2. ^'ADDACrHIYAhU un November 29th Appellate Court noted that Shaikh had not been served and gave February 7th as a new date for hearing. Case against ahaikh is that when Dobbs ordered registration in name of Mubarak and estate,, was duly registered Aysha 2iair grandmother of ?Kamal Abdullah 2»air appellant thought yuliaman shawaf attorney was not present. Also on grounds that Court of Cassation from whence case was transferred to Dand Board has not yet given decision. ^'ACU Estate registered in name of Shaikh Mubarak by Land Board and Partu has been told to obtain copy of Court's order. One Habbaba has petitioned hsxid Board against this decision and his case will be heard by Jardine. 3. Partu considers chance of an appeal by hihaikh succeeding in Bashlyeh case very flimsy but as appeal is being heard on same day as Fad dag iy all considers it better for appeal to be lodged as /littleo 11$ little extra delay will be caused and bhaikh will be satisfied that everything possible has been done. in view of changed circumstances 4. 1 have drafted a comprehensive power of attorney for Partu empowering him to accept service in all cases arising out of Land Board•s proceedings.

But we must no doubt reckon with the possibility that if the counter-claim fails, the Sheikh will appeal to His Majesty 1 s Government for compensation. Against this possibility we think it might be useful to have an account of the judge* s reasons for this decision. Could you obtain this while the matter is still fresh in his mind? Tou should of course avoid any suggestion that we wish to challenge decision: we merely want a clearer picture of the rights and wrongs of the case than we yet liave, m case the Sheikh comes to us for compensation.

I wish to inform Your Excellency that the letter addressed to Ahmad Ali A1 Subah is of no legal value, and has no connection with claims of Habbaba Bint Yusuf El-Ghaneem. Therefore I cannot authenticate these documents, because if the document which they call Probate was a true document I would have signed it and sent it to you for attestation of the seal as usual.

In regard to your son f s statement that in the lawyer's opinion you should prove that the letter in no way refers to the Lady Habibah; I am not in agreement with this view and consider that it is the duty of Your Highness 1 counsel to bring any facts regarding this letter which he may consider are advantageous to your cause to the notice of the President of the 10th Land Board. Should the seal and signature be authentic^which it would appear they undoubtedly are ^then I feel that it is desirable that Your Highness should comply with the request that they be attested. 3. In regard to the alleged Probate, This document appears to be a note made by the Judge of the Sharia Court in explanation of how he arrives at the sum of Es.437/8/- as being the share of the parents of a person unspecified, I agree that the document cannot be considered as a Probate and therefore should not be countersigned and will should Your Highness approve inform His Britannic Majesty 1 s Embassy in Baghdad accordingly. ■-&gt;x.

There was a misunderstanding in the r* Probate, in regard some of the heirs. This fact was brought before the Court here, by some of the heirs, and in fact the Court issued another letter to the aforementioned Ahmad explaining the matter to him and relating the truth. It is quite evident that he, Ahmad, has hidden the second letter and built his claim on the facts stated in the first one, just to create trouble. Your Excellency fill make out k I V*&gt; the misunderstanding, by reading the second letter, a copy of which I enclose herewith. But as to the Probate document, it is not worth to be taken in consideration, as it was not meant for a specified person, therefore it cannot be countersigned. I hope you will kindly forward the second letter to the authorities concerned, so that they may find out the truth. I have already written to my son Mohammad and have sent him a copy of this letter also to show it to our lawyer. iTHjRTTffTBn TRUE COPY. Major, Political Agent, Kuwait.ikv Copy of letter No.143, dated 2nd Dhil-Hejja, 1360, from the Judge of Sharia Court, Kuwait to Shaikh Ahmad al-Shaikh Ali as-Subah. X ( I wrote you a letter^on the 12th Dhil-Kada, 1360, stating that you have a share in what Moza el-Dawood left at her death and that this is a legal heritage coming to you through Sabika al-Subah. That decision was taken according to what was related to us by Abdullah al-Ali-al-Adhbi # But when the heirs were asked to agree to the division of the heritage as I explained to you by that letter some of them refused to agree to the Probate in respect of Sabika 1 s share to those mentioned thereof, claiming that Mohamad died before his mother, and we could not get any proof to prove the claim that Mohamad died after his mother. We therefore held the heritage of Sabika until the matter is made quite clear. We write you this letter so that you may not depend on our previous letter dated 12th Dhil Kada, 1360. We will write to you as soon as the final result is obtained. In the meantime we beg you to prepare a Power of Attorney appointing some one to represent your mother and brothers, in case there will be any shares proved to be your legal rights, we will hand them to your Representative.Ho. ^-32/1. The Political agency, Kuwait, presents its compliraents to His Majaaty'a Srabasay, Baghdad, and has the honour to return the documents enclosed with Embassy note f No.58/14/42, dated February 17th 1942, and to encloye a certified yp &gt; true copy of a letter receited from His Highness the Shaikh of Kuwait in which he acknowledges that the document addressed to Ahmad Ali A1 Subah dated 12th Dil Kada, 1360, was in fact issued by the Sharia Court Kuwait and bears the Qadhi 1 3 signature but explains that it is no longer valid as a further document was issued by the Sharia Court on the 2nd Dil Hejja, 1360, to Ahmad Ali A1 Subah informing him that the question of the inheritance was to be further considered on the production of further evidence and cancelling the letter of the 12th Dil Kada, 1360. A copy of this latter document has been sent to this Agency by His Hii^hness and I enclose it in original.

The necessity for selecting a new advocate in Basrah and as it later transpired a special advocate in Baghdad to represent the As-Subah interests on the 25th May at the hearing of the appeal has meant the preparation of a new set of powers of attorney. The time in which to prepare these documents was I . very short and the task was made no eas ( eir by the precarious state of health in which His Highness has been for some time, his medical advisers having forbidden the discussion of any worrying or irritating subjects and nothing is more irritating than the Date G-arden Case especially when family squabbles are mixed up with it. 3. The powers of attorney were prepared and they were to be signed yesterday May 20th at mid-day when His Highness returned from Falacha Island where he had been for a very short cruise with his medical adviser in attendance. I remained in the Agency until 7-30 p.m. ready to countersign the documents which were to be sent straight to Basrah by a special car so that they could be registered today and Shaikh Mohammad, His Highness 1 son and agent and Haji Suliman Fadhi were to leave this evening for Baghdad to interview the advocate Yusuf al Kabir who is to be briefed to represent His Highness. At 5-30 p.m. on the 20th May His Highness 1 Secretary came to the Agency and said that His Highness had signed the/ P Hobble Lt. Col. W.R. Hay, G.I,E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, TMI H I R- 2 - 17^ the documents but that Shaikh Mubarak bin Hamed bin Mubarak had refused to give His Highness a power of attorney to act on behalf of his half brother Fahad and his two half sisters, who have been cited by the appeallants as parties to the case, on the grounds that they were illegitimate and not entitled to share in the estate and that if he gave a power of attorney then the Shariya Court migjit hold them to be recognised as legitimate by him and they would have a claim on his deceased father's share of the estate. The Secretary informed me that the Sunni Qadhi had refused to certify that they were illegitimate as according to his reading of the law they must be considered as legitimate so that there was no possibility of producing a Shariyah Court ruling and instructing the advocate to contest their being parties to the suit. They have as it happens been parties for a long time but it is only recently that an interfering old busy body by name Shaikh Yusuf bin Isa who was himself Qadhi at one time has persuaded the youth Shaikh Mubarak bin Hamad that he might, by excluding his half brother and half sisters on the grounds of illegitimacy, acquire their share for himself. His Highness 1 Secretary told me that His Highness had spoken to the young man but to no avail so I spoke to his uncle Shaikh Abdullah bin Mubarak and sent the Secretary to reason with him, 4. The Secretary communicated with me early this morning and said that he had been unable to persuade the young man to see reason and that there was nothing for it but to send powers of attorney without Shaikh Mubarak bin Hamad f s young relatives being mentioned by name and hope that the omission would not be noticed. I said that I would see His Highness at once and called upon him at 8-15 a.m. He told me that he had explained every thing to Shaikh Mubarak bin Hamad and had told him that the power of attorney only related to this case and could have no bearing on the future division of the property but that he had not been able to bring him to his senses. I asked His Highness if he realised that if this appeal was lost owing to negligence/negligence on the part of the As-Subah and the estates concerned were alienated His Majesty's Grovernment would probably refuse to consider favourably any claim which he might make on them under the 1914 undertaking. He said he quite understood but that Shaikh Mubarak bin Hamad would not agree and was a child and stupid and asked me if I would see him and endeavour to persuade him to be reasonable. I assented and His Highness immediately issued instructions for the lad to be sent to the Agency, I used every argument I could think off and put the whole case as clearly as it was humanly possible but for some time I was unable to make Shaikh Mubarak bin Hamad see that by the attitude he was adopting he was making it easy for the opposition to acquire the whole estate and that there would then be nothing to divide between himself, the rest of the As-Subah, and his young relatives. I explained His Majesty's Grovemment's position most plainly, and continued my arguments by conjuring up rows of irate relatives who had lost their shares through his obstinacy. Eventually he agreed to sign the power of attorney if His Highness would give him an undertaking in writing that by doing so he did not in any way prejudice his case vis-a-vis his young relatives. His Highness agreed to this at once and the document was duly executed and witnessed by the Qadhi. lhat its legal value is I have very little idea. and sent by the mail car which had been held up until noon for them and with luck they will be registered in Basrah on Saturday and be in the advocate Yusuf al Kabir's hands on Sunday 24th. The powers of attorney were signed and countersigned* - ■ . . ■ ■ *nONFIDENTIAL.

We met the Lawyer Yusuf al Kabeer at the appointed time and as^ed him to accept to be our Lawyer and we gave him the Power of At'Dorne;y and all the documents required for the cases in the Court of Appeal, He promised to call on us in our hotel au eight o*clock to discuss the mstter with us. He came at eight o'clock and declared that he was quite willing to be our Lawyer and he added tnat he was going to attend the Court to-morrow morning and ask the Court to give him all the documents in connection with the ctse and he told us to attend the Couit at nine o'clock, before seeing the case by the Court, 'e went to the Court and met the Lawyer who informed us that he was very sorry to say that he was unable to act as our Lawyer, as Fadhayya 1 s case is a very difficult case and he is sick and so he does not see himself able to do so inspite of our inducing him. At last we asked him to appear in the Court, being our legal Lawyer according to the Power of Attorney he holds, and asii the Court to postpone the case. He agreed to that and attended the Court and asked them to postpone the case so that he may study the documents carefully. The Courts agreed to this and the two cases, i.e. Al-Fadhayya and Al~ Bashya were postponed to 11th July, 1942. Yusuf al Kabeer told us frankly that his opinion was that it would be better for us to appoint the Lawyer Nasrat al Faresi, as he is a very capable person and a notable personality as he was minister for sometime. We, according to your order, could not speak to anybody before consulting the British Embassy, so we went to the/ ^ i~. 7U , i s, - /£ / /tpthe Embassy and had an interview with Major Holt and we explainea the matter to him and told him that the Lawyer Yusuf al Kabeer was not willing to act as our Lawyer, because his he&lt;uluh does not help him to ta^e up such a difficult case and he, being our legal La.^er, agreed to asK the Court to postpone the case ana uhcxt he, lusuf al Kabeer, advised us to appoint the Lawyer Nasrat al Faresi, and that we have orders from His Highness the father, to appoint no any other Lawyer besides Yusuf al r^abeer, unless we consult you first. We asiced him if he agrees upon the appointment of the Lawyer Nasrat al Faresi, ue said, yes, I do agree to appoint the Lawyer Nasrat al Faresi, So we wished him goodbye and went to meet the Lawyer Nasrat al Faresi, but we aid not see him that time. On 'Che second day we met him and asked him if he was prepared to be our Lawyer, He agreed in the begiming provided that there would be no legal obstacles in his way. He said,'Sulaiman Shawaf had sometime back, asked me to communicate with the Ministry of Finance regarding the declaration of the Settlement at Fao and I don f t remember whether I referred to the Ministry of Finance or not'. He asked us to see him to-morrow morning and so we went to him on the next day and reached an agreement regarding his charges which are to be ID,150/-, He told us that he was not prepared to accept neither money nor the documents, being afraid that he had any reference to this case, but he was going to s^udy the case carefully and will let us Know of the result on 9th June, when he will have finished studying the case, I, therefore, wrote a letter to Major Holt explaining to him how far we went with the case, as you can make out from the enclosure.Baghdad. I beg to inform you that I find it quite suitable to let Your Excellency know the result of the proceedings after my last interview with you. The cases have been postponed to the 11th July, 1942 and depending on your approval of appointing His Excellency Nasrat al Faresi, My Lawyer and I met him and asked him to accept our appointing him as our Lawyer. He postponed the final approval in order to have sufficient time to find out that there were no legal hindrance which would prevent him from advocating the cases because our litigants had consulted him before the declaration of the settlement and he does not remember whether he had issued any reference against us signed b^ him or not and in case such a thing has been done by him, he, according to the law, or at least according to the customs, will not be allowed to act as our Lawyer. But in case that no document of this kind had been issued, he agrees in the firsu instance to be our Lawyer and I would like to express my thanks to His Excellency, When we were leaving him he promised to inform our Lawyer of the result of his investigations. f.L.TU. irs^s.^ /d, $ 0. y ^.^3. -(58/30/42) NV 9 Sir.

Sir, fVlfc r *t er to m y telegram iIo.C/703, thelsth AStf IMs!''' :t941 • and 'V S'- 819 ' dat ^ foi |* a PP® a J s .^ a t the position in regard to the 97?To !■ -u P ara ^ ra pii 2 of my telegram of the iMni T Q ?f? e p +' 1941 is not correct as the statements of Partu, His Highness late Attorney, on which that ^'nf^ f er f 9 ot accurate. The case is in fact still before the 10th Land Board but, I understand, the President of the Board hopes to finish the case in two months' time. . The Pao estate comprises the original lands that belonged to His Highness' grandfather Shaikh Mubarak, a considerable area of land reclaimed from the river on the east side of the property, and a lesser area reclaimed from the waste lands to the west or the property. • x That the whole of the original estate will be registered in His Highness 1 name there is little doubt, but the question of the reclaimed land is a very serious one. On the river front this land is in places of considerable depth and is threaded by the water channels which passing from the river to the gardens behind form the sole means of communication between the gardens and the river and along which must pass the produce of the gardens during the date season and the requirements of the cultivators at all times. Should these reclaimed lands not be registered in the name of the Shaikh they together with certain other adjacent properties not owned by the As Subah will completely encircle His Highness 1 estate. Naturally water rights and rights of way will be legally assigned to him but even so the position will be ideal from a mischief-makers point of view and it may well be that the 'Date^ Garden Case' will continue for many more years to be the bete noir of H.B.M's Embassy in Baghdad and the Political Agency in Kuwait. 4. Reclaimed lands are normally planted by the owners of the adjacent territory either by themselves or by their tenants with materials supplied by the owners so that after a lapse of time they become absorbed in the original estate and the owners thereof register the lands as part or their property and pay such taxes and dues as may be leviable. Thus the 10th Land Board would ordinarily register these reclaimed lands adjacent to His Highness 1 property, which have been brought into cultivation by His Highness 1 employees at His Highness 1 expense, in His Highness 1 name, but unfortunately His Highness is a foreigner and I understand that the Iraq law precludes the Land Boards from registering land/ c^&gt;Xol - 2 - President^of thp U Rna^ n ?? e u 0 ^ a : ^ ore iS r ier thus the ml there nn + he P roceed according to the law ana Lnere is no reason to suppose he will not will be whose^n^e Me 0 lan| S ahnni^ will have to decide in TOOse naine i&amp;iie land should be registered. No doubt his Mohaffimerak 1 in SiVh % case of ^aikh Khazal of Moh^erahinwhi ch the Land Board awarded the reclaimed area to the tenants actually tilling the ground, ,, . inereiore unless some means can be devised of tviafk-h^f Knwnf'+ J c ! we + +^'d 'W 1 ® area of land between the hi w n- ^ river in the possession of L ? Highness* ex-tenants, for presumably they will no longer requ 1 re to work for anyone but themselves, a people ignorant and easily swayed by clever and unscrupulous persons. * £| + , tt - ,h.i^ily desirable that good relations with His Highness and between Kuwait and Iraq should be ? a:L Px a iP e i there can be no doubt nor can there be any reasonable doubt that a decision by the Land Board alienating a considerable portion of what His Higriness considers at the ore sent time, rightly or wrongly, t9 be his property will not be at all cipnaucive to the continuance oi good relations either with His Highness now or between the uwo countries in the future. . , _ ignorant of the principle and practice of the land laws of Iraq but suggest that the legal position be examined by skilled persons at H.B .M 's Embassy in Baghdad to see i-f there is any pbssible legal way by which this unfortunate state of affairs can be prevented. I fear it will be a fruitless task and that the only way will be for the Iraq G-overnment to be moved to amend the law to enable an exceptioni to be made in His Highness 1 case and authorise the registratiatfi of the lands in his name. This will no doubt be a formidable and unpleasant task but troublesome though it may be it cannot compare with the tremendous amount of future incon venience which will be saved should it be brought to a successful conclusion.

He replied m the affirmative and I called at his office later the same morning and he was kind enough to give me much valuable information and show me the Surveyrnap of the Fao estates. The information which I received has been embodied in my letter under reference. Sgj u* • enlightenment regarding the delays in the hearing of the Faddaghiyah and Bashiyah appeals, you will remember the appeals were to be neard on the 25th May and uhen on the 11th July and were tnen postponed to the 8th August and that they now seem to have been put off till afte^ the Ramazan, and received the impression that my suspicion that the Bench were not too anxious to hear the case might be well founded. $ | 0 V .. , n n 9? assured that all the necessary papers are in Nazarat al iarasi s hands in Baghdad, whatever may have been the case up to the last hearing, and thai there can be no reasonable excuse for a further postponement, but before ihe case comes on I suggest the Embassy be asked to cause discretje enquiries to be made about the integrity of deciding authority.^fe 'nave a clear case and want justice and that quickly. The Shaikh's Agent, his Basrah Attomey^and his Baghdad Counsel have all been quite remarkably slack - it would seem that it was only ourselves who wished to finish the case - and with His Higjmess 1 full agreement I spoke plainly to Suliman Fadhi.

Presumably the undertaking giTen by His Majesty's Government only covers so much of th4se lands as were in existence in 1914, and if the Shaikh is deprived of them and in addition is denied compensation for some or all of them he will certainly feel that he has been very badly treated; while the fact that in spite of our present position in Iraq we cannot assure to him the possession of property to which he believes himself entitled under all the ordinary Q o-tL ou laws of and m*p, may well affect his relations not only with Iraq but also with His Majesty^ Government# Apart from this the trouble that is likely to result if a strip of alien territory is interposed between the Shaikh^ estate and the river has been fully explained in the Political Agents letter. 3. In these circumstances 1 earnestly hope that if the Iraq Government cannot be induced to amend their laws so as to enable the Shaikh to retain full legal possession of these reclaimed lands some via media will be found which will enable him to retain unchallenged physical possession of them / now His Majesty^ Ambassador, Briti sh Embassy, Baghdad*2-^ K now and in the future* 4* I am forwarding a copy of this letter and its enclosure to His Majesty^ Secretary of State for India and the GoyemiDent of India# X have the honour to be.

But even then H#M.G» were not satisfied that it would be possible to maintain the position, vide India Office letter No.P.Z.1743/33 dated 31.3*33« In the present case it was at our instance, and for the Shaikh^ benefjit, that tbe land settlement law has been applied to his properties, and the Shaikh has submitted to the jurisdiction of the Settlement Commission. It would therefore prima facie illogical to take an attitude that may delay a settle ment. To avoid the issue of personal service on the Shaikh it may be possible to arrange for substituted service on his lawyer. p./. I uju^. 6u* mt tcuwctx • im, ■ . -ff' J S5 Uji_^ /t/.

The letter asks for him to a sign a form that formally discharges the British government from liability for taxation losses and contains a draft copy of such a form.The file also contains correspondence about a forthcoming change in the Iraqi land settlement law concerning the ownership of land by foreigners as well as correspondence regarding a court summons issued by Iraq against a number of members of the Al Sabah family including Shaikh Aḥmad (ff. 89-91).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><topic>Land ownership</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0001da#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
