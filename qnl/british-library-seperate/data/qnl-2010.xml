The volume, which is numbered I, covers the main routes in Persia, and was produced by the General Staff, India. It was printed by M Abdul Hameed Khan, Manager of the Feroz Printing Works, Lahore, in 1942. An introduction (folio 3) states that the volume has been updated on the basis of reports received in the wake of the Anglo-Soviet invasion of Persia in August 1941.The volume comprises details of sixty-five routes, listed on the contents page, between various towns and cities in Persia. Details given for each route include:an overview (distance, number of stages, references to maps);a general report (classification of route, surface and grading, character of adjacent country, climatic effects, exceptional features, repair and supply facilities, water, fuel, fodder and grazing supplies);a detailed report (villages and other landmarks encountered, road classifications, distances).A handwritten annotation on folio 5 (author unknown) states that ‘distances are somewhat overestimated throughout this report.’ The volume includes a map in a pocket attached to the inside back cover (folio 246).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Motor transport</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>General Staff Branch, India</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Persia</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Second World War (1939-1945)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Military intelligence</topic></subject><subject><topic>Surveys</topic></subject><subject><topic>Roads</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000239.0x000133#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
