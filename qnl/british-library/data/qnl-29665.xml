FOREIGN OFFICE, S.7/.1. 18th August, 19U7- Thank you for your letter of 29th July enclosing a letter from Mr. Jennings Bramly about the status of the Sinai Peninsula. We, too, have received a number of letters on this subject from him and. have been carefully considering the points which he raises. We shall be writing to LIr. Jennings Bramly in due course and your Secretary of State may care to let him know that his letter has been referred to the Foreign Office. In case your Secretary of State is interested in the subject of Mr. Jennings Bramley’s letter I enclose a memorandum on the subject prepared in the Foreign Office (copies of the map and firman stated to be annexed are not at present available) though v/e should not wish the memorandum to be conmunicated to Mr. Jennings Bramley as it stands. R.M.J. Harris, Esq.., M.V.C. Commonwealth Relations Office, King Charles Street.The Sinai Question 1, By a firman issued to Mohammed Ali on the liith February, 1841, the^Bultan granted to the Ahedive (the word used is '‘R^integr^ 1 ) the government of Egypt as defined within limits traced on a map enclosed with the firman, with the privilege of heredity, that is to say, the right to regard the grant as a permanent one. A copy of the firman together with a copy of the map enclosed therein taken from ls La Frontiers Occidentals de 1* Egypte: Accord Italo-iigyptien du 6 D&lt;5cembre 1925 w (published by Imprimerie Nationals Cairo 1927) are annexed. The map shows the Egyptian frontier as running from Suez to Raffah but Egypt has in fact exercised administrative authority, at least since 1841, over the r.est of the Sinai Peninsula from Suez to Akaba for the protection of the Egyptian pilgrimage. In 1892 on the accession of the Khedive Abbas a new firman gave sanction to this position by an iradeh of the 8 th May, 1892, The administration of the Sinai Peninsula was granted to Egypt up to the line from Raff ah to Akaba at the head of the gulf of that name. The effect of this decision was conveyed by the telegram addressed to the Khedive dated the 8 th April, 1892 ? according to which the Sultan assumed possession of the posts garrisoned by Egypt on the Hedjaz, or the eastern coast, of the gulf of Akaba. The telegram read thus: 11 As regards the Tor-oinai Peninsula the status quo is maintained, and it will be administered by the khedivate in the same manner as it was administered in the time of your grandfather Ismail Pasha, and of your father, Mohammed Tewfik Pasha. 11 As the above named posts in the Hedjaz reclaimed by Turkey were of no importance to Egypt, the telegram was considered satisfactory, and was publicly read with theftonan cfinvestituro. Lord Cromef, in order to clarify the position, addressed a Note dated the Ijth April, 1892, to the Egyptian Minister for Foreign Affairs stating that His Excellency was aware no alteration could be made in the relations between the Sublime Porte and Egypt without the consent of the British Government. He added that the telegram from the Sultan made it clear that the Sinai Peninsula ' tha t is to say the territory boun ded east kEUl.. lin e rum i ing in a sout h~east e~ f ly 'dif e ction from a poi nt a s hort 'd jston c osto th o~ east of El Arish to t he head o f the Gulf of ^ilcaba^ was to continue to be administered by Egypt. The Fort of Akaba itself which lay to the east of the line in question was to form part of the Vilayet of the Hedjaz. . jh The position as thus defined by. Lord Cromer was undoubtedly accepted by Turkey and the representatives of France and Russia in Cairo 'took act of the communication*. It was qgreed that 'the point a short distance to the east of _Jl Arish' was Rafi ah. which had always been recognised as the point from Tihicia thw frontier began in the north. 4 * * * * 4. In the year 1906 certain difficulties arose between Egypt .end Turkey in this part of the world, arising from the decision to make certain administrative reforms in the Sinai Peninsula which had become necessary by reason of the restlessness of the Bedouins, This decision was misconstrued by the Turkish Government, who stated that Egyptian forces had encroached on Turkish territory. Mr, Jennings-Bramley was the British officer in command of the/tho small force which, was involved in this incident. 5 . At the instance of the British Government the Khedive asked the Sultan to agree to the appointment of a Boundary Commission. In reply the Turkish Government maintained that not only Akaba, but its neighbourhood, including a place called Taba, was Turkish territory, and that it was not included in the 9 * 11 privilege' territory of Egypt (that is to say the territory the hereditary possession of which './as vested in Mohammed Ali by the firman of 1341, which did not include the Sinai Peninsula). This attitude on the part of the Turkish Government was interpreted by the British Government as a refusal to admit the arrangement provided for in 1392 according to which the administration of the Sinai Peninsula was granted to Egypt up to a line from Raffah to Akaba, that is to say, an extension to the west of the line originally laid down in 1841. 6 . It became apparent that there was a difference of opinion between the British and Turkish Governments regarding the proper interpretation of the balegram addressed to the Khedive in 1892, but in due course this difference of opinion was disposed of by an Exchange of iTotes which took place on the 14th and 15 th May, 1906. According to. this Exchange of -Notes it is agreed that Turkish troops should be withdrawn from Taba, and that instructions should bo issued to Turkish officers to demarcate the boundary jointly with, officials to be appointed by the Khedive, the line of demarcation to run from Raffah, in a south-easterly direction to a point on the Gulf of Akaba not less than three miles from Akaba # so as to ensure the maintenance of the status quo in the Sinai Peninsula on the basis of the telegram above mentioned of the 6 th April, 1892 . 7. A commission was duly appointed by Turkey and Egypt on the basis of a line so agreed, and the Agreement was signed at Raff ah on 1st October, 1906 between the Turkish and Egyptian Commissioners concerning the fixing of a separating administrative line between the Vilayet of Hedjaz and Govemorate of Jerusalem and the Sinaia Peninsula,” The text of this Agreement is given in Part 67 of the further^Correspondence, page 50 . 8 . Prom the map annexed to the 1841 firman it will be seen that the territory really in dispute is that enclosed by lines drawn from Raffah to Akaba and to Suez, and from Suez following the coastline to Akaba. 9 . Mr. Jennings-Bramley*s contention is that the area within these lines has never been transferred to Egyptian sovereignty, and the whole of his argument really turns on the use of the words administrative u and “administration” in the texts quoted above. He says that because these territories were given only for administration, Egypt never acquired sovereignty over them, that sovereignty remaining with Turkey. I do not think that any argument can be built up merely on the use of the word '•'administration”, because nominally Turkish suzerainty continued•over all the territories granted to Egypt, whether they were granted in heredity, that is to say, •‘privilege' territory, or for administrat ion. There is no doubt that a distinction existed, and that the area included/13 ./ included in the above lines was never gr&amp;ntsd as “privilego“ territory; but it is questionable whether* this distinction really affects the legal position. Some degree of sovereignty must have been implied by the grant of administration even though it was only temporary* l^ven the sovereignty of the xvhadiva over Bgypt proper was not perfect or full sovereignty). Turkey could have intended little more than to retain a nominal claim to » ro-occupy this area if she should so desire. In the meantime the position of the territory would 'bo somowhat similar to that of territory, which was for example, granted on a ninety-nine year’s lease*, except that in the case of the lease the period of tenure is clearly fixed. 10, On the basis of this distinction Mr. Jennings- Bramiay maintains that the sovereignty over this area must belong either to Turkey or to Great Britain. The claim of Turkey to any part of this territory is obviousljT- entirely disposed of by Articles 16 and 17 of the- Treaty of Lausanne, by which Turkey renounced all rights and titles to territories lying outside the frontiers laid down by the Treaty. This area is nowhere near those frontiers, and I think any Turkish claim must be dismissed as fantastic, 11, The frontier between Dgypt and Palestine has never been precisely defined. Recitals contained in the Mandate for Palestine of July 24th, 1922, refer to the administration of the territory of Palestine :j which formerly belonged to the Turkish Umpire within such boundaries as may be fixed by them 11 (that is to say the principal Allied powers). In fact the boundaries were never so fixed, but there is a document by which the Council of the League of Nations was invited to pass a resolution stating that the provisions of the Mandate were not applicable to the territory known as Transjordan W which comprises all territory lying to the east of a lino drawn from a point two miles west of the town of Akaba u * Such a resolution was passed by the Council of the League of Nations in September, 1922. This resolution is the only formal record bearing upon the frontier between Palestine or Transjordan and Lgypt, There is, however* in addition a communication made by Lord Lloyd to the Egyptian Government (the terms of which are not avallab We know, however, the instructions which were given to Lord Lloyd, and we must presume he carried them out, 12 , In February, 1926, Mr, Navile Henderson, as he then^was, sent a copy of a Note which he had received from the Egyptian Government recognising the special position of His Majesty's Government in relation to the territories of Palestine and Irak. In the Egyptian Note, after recognising this special position, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, referred to the Preamble of the Mandate for Palestine (which states that the frontiers are to be fixed later by the Allied Powers), and made all reservations in so far as concerned the frontier of Egypt and Palestine. The Egyptian Note said nothing about the Agreeraent of 1906 , and it was we who specifically referred to this Agreement. The terras of the statement which Lord Lloyd was authorised to make to the Egyptian Government were that this ‘'de-limitation' '(that is the de-limitation oi the frontiers between Egypt and Palestine when it should be made) -‘in no v/ay concerns the Egyptian - * Palestine frontier as defined in the year^lpOS,'O' Sy»/L y n SDth July, 1947 Dear Kiunr,, The jcreta’ ’^* Jr nt.it o tins received the enclonod letter riWnriJi'lvsle corremondent in ..aynt. The questions raised in it. namely, the use ox’ the Suez Oanai ,&lt;yid South Sinai are. you will agree, matters for the xoroign Orrice. The only apparent reason why the v/riter of the letter hrs approached ny .&lt;ecretarv of State is the importance to the two new Indian Dominions of the maintenance of the short sea route from this country to India through tho Suez Canal. It may well be that the writer of the letter has already tried without success to get some change out oi the Foreign Office on the questions he raises. I should be very grateful indeed Lr you would arrange xbr a reply to be sent to the letter or, alternatively, for us to be provided with a short draft reply to be sent on behalf Ox the Secretary of .^tate.Private Secretary. The Secretary of State* s ccrrespondent (w^iose signature I cannot ^read) propos^^]^^ presumably H.M.G., should establish a permanent post in South Sinai - he does not define what kind of post he has in mind, but it is evidently not a diplomatic post - with a view to establishing British influence(or control)on the east side of the Suez Canal in order to protect traffic passing through it to India and the Bastern Dominions. I suggest that if the Secretary of State wishes to be in a position to answer this letter he should ask the Foreign Office to adv ise on the nature of a reply. It is clearly^6i&gt;fcclusiveI2 not an^Endia Office matter.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000517.0x000202_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/1213</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000517.0x000202</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/1213</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Ext 2123/47 'Status of Sinai Peninsula'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1947/1947</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2018-05-18T14:07:12</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (6 folios)</extent><extent>The file's contents are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 10, these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>This file consists of letters and telegrams between officials of the Foreign Office and the Commonwealth Relations Office, regarding the status of the Sinai Peninsula, following a letter from Wilfred Jennings Bramly.
