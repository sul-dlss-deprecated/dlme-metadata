In a recent Circular to the Political Agents, Ho, 1944-6 0 f 23rd December 1933, I made certain suggestions as to making Agency Diaries more generally interesting, I have given some further thought to the matter and subject to suggestions from the Political Agents concerned and to the approval of the Government of India and the Secretary of State for India, Agency Diaries with effect from 1st April will take the following form, their distribution ranaining as at present. 3. The more appropriate nomenclature of 'Intelligence Summaries' will take the place of 'Diaries', and these Summaries/2 - Summaries -will cover fortnightly (half monthly) periods. The obvious advantage of a fortnightly Summary over a Monthly one is that the news it contains is more up to date. Summaries will be humbered consecutively beginning with that for the period 1st - 15th April, as will the paragraphs they contain, and reference to previous paragraphs dealing with the same subject should be made. Cross-headings should be used to indicate a change of subject. 4. The Summaries will be mariced SECRETT so that confidential matter can be included in them. Thus for example the progress of Oil affairs in Bahrain and Kuwait can be indicated. Such references, however, need only be very brief. 5. At present the Political Agent, Kuwait, sends two Diaries: one for general distribution, the other for the Political Resident, the Ambassador at Baghdad, the Air Officer Commanding, f Iraq Command, and His Majesty’s Minister, Jedda. In future these two Diaries can be incorporated in one Intelligence Summary. A copy of this Memorandum together with a copy of the Circular mentioned in paragraph 2 above is being sent to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department and to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India. \ * Lt.-Colonel, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.3 # • • GOVERNMENT OP INDIA, Department.

C i r e u 1 a r* With reference to my Circular No.189-3 of 19th February 1934 with regard to Intelligence Summaries. 2. Political Agents are reminded that the main object of the new form of Intelligence Summaries (taking the place of the old Diaries), which are now marked 'Secret', is to keep the numerous officials outside the Persian Cult, who are interested in its affairs, informed of the trend of events along the Arab Coast. If this object is achieved * ^ ^ nmnii mmtammmmmm writing of ad interim letters to these officials should ^ loe re( a u ced. k-yi'-urwoufafij os /YcJ/ 1 'U^lrr^u?JGat t0 obta i n a concession for the export of peacock feathers 3. The following are examples of what is meants- (a) The Patagonian Peacock Company are endeavouring A/9. CcS o/i S euuj&amp; { * V 7 - from the territory of Shaikh Saif bin ialoos, who is also being approached by the British Peacock company. ihe Intelligence Summary of the Political Agent, in whose area these activities are being carried out, would contain these facts under an appropriate heading. In his next Summary the Political Agent would chronicle the fact that the negotiators of both Companies had arrived and had commenced negotiations./I r- negotiations. Later, he might have to give the information that Bin Faloes was inclined towards the foreign concern. Later still, he might have to mention that matters between the Shaikh and the two Companies had come to a deadlock. Finally, I trust, the Political Agent would be in the happy position of stating that the British Company had secured the concession. (b) The Royal Air Force wish to establish a base somewhere in a Political Agent’s territory, xhere are bhe usual delays but finally the Royal Air Force get what they want. The Political Agent concerned would note these various steps in his Summaries. (c) There is a state of unrest in some part of a Political Agent’s area. He would note this in his Summary and continue to touch on the situation until it had been cleared up. 4. Mentions in Summaries can be brief as they are supplemented by the usual telegrams and despatches to the Political Resident. Details of negotiations with Shaikhs should not be given, nor normally should opinions be volunteered (these of course can be given in separate communications to the Political Resident). v/hat are wanted are facts.
