In particular, this image is intended to illustrate the habits of dress as described previously by Frederick Mercer Hunter (p. 45). Hunter describes these as follows:‘The men wear a single white garment (tobe) of cotton , about thirty inches wide and three to four yards long, which is simply folded round the body, an end being brought occasionally over the head or the shoulder. This cloth is not secured in any way, being retained in its place by the wearer’s hands, and accordingly presents the appearance of always being about to fall off, as it occasionally does, shocking the modesty of beholders […] The head is kept bare, except among the more wealthy, and when not shaved or covered with curly locks, or resembling a mop, is plastered tightly all over with a mixture of white earth or lime […] Many Somalis dress like Arabs, Indians, and even Europeans.’The man stands in a contrapposto pose: in his right hand he is holding a long walking stick, which is partially concealed by his draping robe. Although the man is clearly photographed in a studio setting with a backdrop, at least four rocks and stones have been placed about his feet – perhaps to lend an air of authenticity to his ethnic dress.Inscriptions:In pencil, upper left corner adjacent to print: ‘8’</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="personal"><namePart>Frederick Mercer Hunter</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Aden</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Ethnographic heritage</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023400730.0x000008#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
