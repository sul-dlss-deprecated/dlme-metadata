It will be observed that the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury have so far refused to accept Lord Curzon’s proposal that Mr .Hubbard should receive an allowance and repayment of the actual medical expenses connected with the amputation of his leg, but Lord Curzon hopes that ohey may see their way to reconsider their decision on receipt of his further letter, .and he Ihe Under Secretary of State, India Office, be. i 'i - L • * . &gt;. a r he trusts that, in that case the Secretary of State for India in Council would agree to defray from India revenues a moiety of the expenses involved. &lt; I am, Sir, •Your most obedient, humble Servant, (x .

Sir, #ith reference to your letter 7302/16 of the 5th April 1916, I am directed by Earl Curzon of Kedleston to request that you will lay before the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury for Their further consideration ube case of Mr * G.E. Hubbard who was severely wounded in the leg in an attack by Persian brigands while he was employed on the Turko«Persian Frontier Commission in 19161. Mr. Hubbard has been continuously under treatment since he was wounded, in the hope that he might recover the use of his leg but these efforts have proved un availing and it? has recently become necessary to amputate the wounded limb. Should the operation prove entirely successful Mr. Hubbard will in due course be fitted with an artificial leg. Their Lordships are aware that a sum of £2,000 was obtained from the Persian Government by way of compensa tion for the injury which Fir. Hubbard received and that after deduction of the expenses of the prolonged illness which he suffered and the treatment which becams necessary a sum of just over £1,000 was received by him. Lord Curzon is of opinion that this balance of the payment of the Persian Government cannot fairly be considered as / The Secretary to the Treasury.I2&gt; - 2 - aa applicable to the cost of Mr. Hubbard’s recent operation and the purchase of an artificial leg since if it were so appropriated practically nothing would be left in respect of the compensation for the outrage to which Mr. Hubbard may justly be considered as entitled from the Persian Government. it was in fact purely as com pensation and not as payment of expenses, that the sum of £2,000 was obtained from the Persian Government. Had it been possible to foresee that very heavy expenses would be involved there is no doubt that a much larger sum would have been obtained. Lord Gurzon has considered the possibility of making a further claim upon the Persian Government but His Lordship has decided that, In view of the present political conditions in Persia, it is not practicable to demand a further payment. In these circumstances, I am to suggest for Their Lordships most favourable consideration that the expenses of Mr. Hubbard’s operation and the cost of supplying and fitting an artificial leg should be charged to Public Funds. It is not possible to determine at present the extent to which Mm. Hubbard’s physical disability will prejudice his career as a Consular Officer though it is bound to have an effect of this kind and I am to say that the Secretary of State proposes to approach Their Lordships as soon as it'is possible to judge of the affects of his recent operation for the grant of a suitable annual allowance somewhat analogous to the wound pension granted to military officers whose military careers have been seriously affected by wounds received on active service. I am. ,etc., (Sd) G^. SPICER.COPY 14- 35766/19. (14277 V97908/234A.) TREASURY CHAMBERS. WHITEHALL, LONDON. — October 17th, 1919 W Lord, 7272 I have laid -Ihd Lords Commissioners of His tejesty’s Treasury m. Spicer’s letter of the 15th August last (97908/234/K.) in which Earl Curzon of Kedleston purposes that Mr. G.E. Hubhard, an officer of the Levant Consular Service, who was in jured while employed on the Turko-Persian Frontier Commission, should be granted from public funds, in addition to the sum of £2,000 recovered on his behalf from the Persian Government, the expenses of the last operation undergone by him, the cost of supplying and fitting an artificial leg and hereafter an annual allowance on the analogy of the wounds pensions granted to Army officers. f W Lords assume that these proposals are condi tional upon the secretary of State for India in Council agreeing to defray from Indian Revenues a moiety of the expenditure involved. In reply I am to state that Their Lordships fail to apprehend upon what grounds it is held that the question / The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office.question of increasing the compensation already secured for Mr. Hubbard should be settled by reference to the awards made to Army officers who are wounded in action. As the Secretary of State is aware, a Warrant framed under section 1. of the superannuation Act 1887 regu lates the grant of compensation in cases in which / civilian officers of the crown are unfortunately in jured during the course of their duties. Their Lordships are unable to deal with Mr. Hubbard's case except under the terms of that Warrant. If Mr. Hubbard had not received as compensation a net sum of over £1,000, after deduction of expenses already incurred by him in connection with his injury, My Lords, on learning that the Secretary of State agreed to the application of the Warrant to the case, would have been prepared to sanction the repayment to him from public funds, in addition to the payments pro vided for by the Warrant, of reasonable outlay strictly of the nature of medical expenses, on production of vouched accounts, but on Their present information They do not see what justification there is for placing Mr. Hubbard in a better position than that of any other civil servant who received an equally severe injury in the course of his duties. The fact that partial conpensation has in the present case been recovered from a third party scarcely seems to afford sufficient ground for differentiation. They would however suggest that with a view to reducing these expenses the artificial leg which is required should be obtained through the agency of the Ministry of Pensions, which has peculiar facilities for supply of such appliances.

The explanation is that owing to his wounds Hubbard was unable to resume duty between January 1st and June 9th, 1915, and would in ordinary circumstances have been placed on half salary for that period. In anticipation of the compensation to be recovered from the Persian Government the difference between half and full salary was made good to him, and one-half of the additional payment of half salary was paid by you on our application.

Sir With reference to Sir Eyre Crowe’s letter No, 7506/15 of January 23rd of last year authorising me to submit statements of the additional expenditure entailed upon me by the injuries which I received while serving on the Turco-Persian Frontier Commission, to be met by advances on the sum claimed by way of compensation on my behalf from the Persian Government, I have the honour to enclose herewith a further account of such expenditure from May 17th to the £324. 1. 5, present date, amounting in all to the sum of Three hundred and twenty-four pounds one shilling and five pence. Previous advances were made to me in January £150. and May, 1915, of the sums of One hundred and fifty £160. pounds, and One hundred and sixty pounds respectively. The largeness of these sums is chiefly accounted for by the fact that I have had to undergo three major operations in the course of the last fifteen months besides having seven weeks of treatment in a special nursing home; having been unable to walk during the greater part of the time, my travelling expenses have also been very considerable. As my disablement has unfortunately become permanent since my last operation, at which it was found necessary to excise part of the sciatic nerve, resulting in complete paralysis of the leg below the knee, there are certain extraordinary expenses (such as The Under Secretary -of- State for Foreign Affairs.-as cafe-fares, the necessity, in London, of living in a flat provided with a lift etc.) from which I can never hope to fee free. In view of this, I venture most respectfully to request that I may receive, if possible, the balance of the compensation (£1,000) mentioned in Sir E. Crowe's letter of January 23rd, 1915.

In amplification of my telegram, dated 5th September, I have the honour to submit, for your information, the following report on the circumstances under wnich Mr. Hubbard was severely wounded on 31st August, and the steps taken to secure the arrest of the Kurds implicated, together with a report by Captain H. W. Pierpoint, I.M.S., on his present condition. 2. On l9th August I left Barduk with a Sub-Commission to erect pillars upon the watershed between Barduk and Kotur. The roads being difficult, and it being necessary to pass into Turkish territory, which I was anxious to avoid doing with a large caravan, owing to the mobilisation now proceeding at Bashkaleii and the consequent general perturbation and lack of supplies, I requested Colonel Byder to proceed with the rest of the British Commission to Khaniga via Chehrik, staying a day near Dilman to collect supplies. He did so, and on 31st August reached Ashnok, on his way from Dilman to Khaniga. 3. On the afternoon of the same day the British officers of the camp all went out to shoot partridges, as we have habitually done for the past ten months, and it was whilst they were out shooting, less than two miles from camp, in a ravine which had been pointed out to them by local villageis, that the incident occurred, under the circumstances mentioned in my above telegram and detailed in the enclosures to this despatch. \ It was not until 3rd September that I heard from Colonel Byder, who came *to Khaniga for the purpose, of the occurrence, several letters sent to me having miscarried. 5. I should mention that a rumour reached me at Burushkuva and again at Keshgul on the afternoon of 1st September that a Bussian officer, or Cossack, had been w'ounded by Persian Kurds, subjects of Ismail Agha, the Peisian tribal chief in charge of the Kotur, Dilman and Somai districts, and I was assured that this had been done by the Kurds to get this chief, who was friendly to the Bussians, into trouble with the latter. I mentioned the rumour to M. Minorsky but took no further action. 6. I reached camp on the evening of the 3rd September and at once sent lor Ismail Agha 1 he had already visited Colonel Byder, and had arrested six men belonging to the encampment and village close to which the ahair had occurred. _ India, Foreign Secretary^ No ’y ’Vlf id FEH # f dI 7. On the 4th September I held a Court of Enquiry and took sworn depositions of two officers conc c rning the Vide Sub-enclosure No. i. incident; this procedure is perhaps some what irregular, but it seemed the most expeditious and effective method of placing on record formal evidence which could be cited in case of necessity in a Persian Court of Law. To these depositions I added, on 5th September, those of Mr. Hubbard. 8. I requested Colonel Eyder to take the rest of the British Commission to Kotur fl/a Khaniga, I myself remaining behind to enquire into the affair and to arrange for Mr. Hubbard’s removal to Khoi as soon as his condition permitted. 9. On the afternoon of the 4th September Ismail Agha arrived with the six men he had arrested. I examined them and recorded the purport of their statements. Mr. Hubbard’s condition did not permit of their being paraded before him for identifica tion. Vide Sub-enclosure No. 2. TO. I will not at present attempt to comment on their evidence in detail, but I may remark that the excuse for firing on our party advanced by them that they thought they were Turks, seems plainly to be an afterthought, as Mr. Hubbard’s evidence indicates clearly that they mistook our party for Russians. It will be noted that it has been admitted in evidence that' they heard firing for an hour without taking any action (the encampment was onlV 400 yards from the ravinej : it was broad daylight (5-30 p.m.) : all the party were dressed distinctively and could not have been mistaken for Turks: Major Cowie’s party, who were fired on first, were moving up the nullah towards Turkey from Persia : the presence of the detachments of the Erontier Commission in the neighbourhood was well known to every one, and its movements bad been dis cussed for months past: three or four small parties had been for a fortnioht within 20 miles of this place engaged in survey and other work at different points, and had passed close by. All this must have been perfectly well known to the tribesmen, especially to those who (like those now implicated) have recentlv been domiciled on the Turkish side, where all guards have been strengthened and additional posts established during the last three months in anticipation of our arrival. 11. The first remarks of the Kurds to Mr. Hubbard {vide his evidence) coupled with the form in which the rumour first reached me {vide paragraph 5), and considered in the light of information which has reached me regarding Ismail i^gha’s relations with the Muhammadi Shikak and other tribes, and regarding his relations with the Russians, tend to confirm the opinion recorded in my telegram of 5th September, that the outrage was committed by the tribesmen of the Muhammadi Shikak clan with the object of embroiling Ismail Agha (who has frequently looted them) with his friends the Russians, to whom he owes his present position and influence, Russian friendship' having taken, I understand, the substantial form of a present of 1,000 rifles with ammunition. 12. It is interesting in this connection to recall that M. Vedenskv, Russian Vice-Consul at Urmi, and M. Minorsky, both told me some weeks ago that their quondam friend and protege Ismail Agha was now under a cloud, owing to his unauthorised depredations on his neighbours and to the improper advantage he had taken of the support the Russian authorities had accorded him, and that his actions were being made the subject of an enquiry. 13. Present condition of Mr. Bubbard .—I can add nothing to Captain Sub-enclosure No. s. Rierpoint’s lucid report on this subject: Mr. Hubbard has shown throughout the greatest fortitude and patience, bearing unmurmuringly the continuous pain which he has been suffering. It is impossible at present to say when and how we can move him, and when he will reach England: information on these points will be submitted periodically by telegraph. (f 11 % ii k( ) 3 14. Ttetribufory action against guilty parties .—This question is not one with which I am competent to deal. I hope to send as many implicated persons as possible to Tabriz to be dealt with there by the local authorities in commu nication with His Majesty’s Consul, Tabriz, with whom I am in direct commu nication on the subject. I venture to hope that His Majesty’s Government will cause such representations to be made to the Persian Government as will ensure the exemplary punishment ol‘ those responsible for the outrage and the provision of adequate compensation for Mr. Hubbard. The incident is ascribable directly to the neglect of the Persian Govern ment and of the local Azarbaijan authorities to take any steps to ensure the safety of the Frontier Commission whilst in Persian territory. Whilst the Turks have doubled or trebled their frontier posts, and seen that every village near the frontier was notified of our arrival and, generally, occupied bv a squad of Turkish soldiers, the Persian local authorities on the other hand have sent no representative with us, and have taken no action of any sort. The application for a guard to the Governor of Dilman, which Colonel Ryder made as a matter of routine, was ignored (the single Cossack provided deserting half way), nor did Ismail Agha, who had been warned in writing several days beforehand of our arrival within his district (i.e., from Sero and from Burduk) by M. Miuorsky, take any steps to depute representatives to accompany us. 15. In conclusion, I venture, with great respect, to record my opinion that the action of all officers concerned, from first to last, in connection with this unfortunate occurrence was unexceptionable, and that the incident cannot be attributed to any lack of foresight or prudence on the part of any of them. I trust, Sir, that, after perusal of the evidence and other documents annexed to this despatch, you will see no reason to differ from this conclusion. 16.

M. we went out to shoot partridges: the party included Major Cowie Captain Brooke [ with shot guns ; and myself ) and Mr. Hubbard, unarmed, 10 sowars and khalasis, unarmed, as beaters. We proceeded up the ravine for } mile where it divided into two : Major Cowie, Captain Brooke and five men followed the left hand branch, the rest of the party taking the right hand branch. Both branches were deep, and divided from each other by a spur 400 feet high, so that neither party could see or hear what was going on in the adjoining ravine. After following our branch for about f mile, finding no birds, we decided to return (we were then less than J hour from camp), Mr. Hubbard also returning to camp, along the spur, between the two parties. After we had followed down the ravine for ten minutes, eight to ten men appeared on the slopes of the spur between the two ravines (down stream from Mr. Hubbard) on our flank and at once opened tire on us at 250 yards, advancing at the same time. Ihe fire was deliberately aimed, several shots passing quite close to us. I could see them clearly and there could be no doubt that they could also see us clearly. I decided to retire to camp as quickly as possible to seek assistance in case Major Cowie’s party should be involved. On arrival near camp I saw that Major Cowie’s party had reached camp before me and were already returning to our assistance. Mr. Hubbard, however (whom I had not been able to see on the crest of the spur from the bottom of the ravine), had not arrived and I therefore sent out Captain Brooke, Officer Commanding Escort, Captain Pierpoint, I.M.S., and ten sowars and several men from the neighbouring encampment of Ashnok to search for him. They brought him in an hour later. On arrival at camp I sent a letter to Ismail Agha who reached my camp next afternoon accompanied by a hundred men. He sent to the encampment of Qizil Kend, close to which the incident had occurred, and two hours later brought six men into our camp. They at first denied that they were concerned ; they were taken aside by Ismail Agha, and after a short time the latter informed me in Persian in their presence that they had confessed that they bad taken part in the attack on us. Their demeanour was calm and they showed no signs of having been subjected to pressure with a view to extort confession : this statement was received without comment by the prisoners. Ismail Agha then asked me what I wished done with them. I told him to keep them prisoners till he had communicated with the authorities at Khoi and received orders from them, In reply to a query from me as to whv the attack had taken place, Ismail Agha stated that the men had asserted that* they believed us to be Turks. itead over and acknowledged correct.

Up to this moment I thought that it was a Kurdish sportsman • who had come to join us, as not infrequently happens: shortly after this I saw a Kurd deliberately fire several shots at this sowar at a range of about 50 yards and miss him. At that moment some four or five jnore men appeared on the top of the spur to my left front with a dog. Major Cowie then shouted to me that it was time to go, so I told the men to return to camp and myself wuth three men ran up the opposite slope towards Major Cowie and got into camp shortly after him : the Kurds fired a few shots at us as we retired. The firing on us was deliberately aimed throughout: they followed us to within sight of the camp. Just after I got in Colonel Ryder’s party arrived, with the exception of Mr. Hubbard, and I at once took steps, under Colonel Ryder’s orders, to go out with ten men to look for Mr. Hubbard.

I left camp in company with Colonel S riwu«„. Ryder and party. I was unarmed. We Mr g. e. Hntbard. Co. S u,.r s.,vic went up a large ravine for 40 minutes stt. September iyi4. shooting steadily to a point where the ravine branched: thence I accompanied Colonel Ryder and Captain Pierpoint UT&gt; the right hand branch and saw Major Cowie and Captain Brooke go up the other branch. After continuing about -0 minutes up the said ravine, I left Colonel Rvder saying that I intended to climb on to the ridge separating our ravine from that in which Major Cowie was. I intended to go to them to see what luck they were having and return with them. I saw Colonel Ryder and Captain Pierpoint start walking down the ravine towards camp. As I went up the slope I beard the discharge of a rifle, but this being a verv frequent «* occurrlnce in this country, I attached no special significance to it When I reached the top of the ridge I could see across Major Cowie s ravine to a nomad encampment | mile the other side and I saw a small group of six to ei-ht armed men on the further edge of the nullah sho uting and running about I went a little way towards the ravine to try to see Major Cow.e s party and suddenly felt myself hit in the leg and fell. I got up and tried to return on the ridge but after going a few yards a second bullet hit the ground near me I then lay down on the ground and waited. After some time our or five Kurds came to me from the direction of Major Cowie’s ravine, I talked to them but had difficulty in understanding their dialect and m making myself understood : I said, “ I am not a Russian ”, and they appeared surprised and questioned me again and again saying, “Are you not a Russian ?”, and they shouted to each other something about “Russians”: during this time men were coming and going between where I was and the encampment. Thev asked me for money and one of them felt in one pocket and removed a letter but they did not rifle my person. They were evidently in doubt what to do They asked “Who shot you?” several times. They finally left me: I heard a shot fired, undoubtedly by them, shortly after. At the moment I was shot it was broad daylight, and I can swear it was not later than 5-45 as Thad looked at my watch when X started to climb the ridge. My impression is that it was not later them 5-30. T staved alone rather over half an hour till I was found by a party-from our camp, which was accompanied by some villagers from Ashnok. Read over to Mr. Hubbard and acknowledged correct. 5th September 191L A. T. Wilson, Captain. (Mr. Hubbard unable to sign.)Sub-enclosure No. 2. Translation of purport of evidence given before Captain JVilson at Ashnok on 4th September 1914, in the presence of Ismail Jgha, each man being examined publicly and separately, not in the hearing of the other accused persons. 1. I belong to the Muhammadi section of the Sbakak tribe. I formerly Accused m. i. lived at Habanawa in Persia: last year Mabmaieb, son of Atn. J was at Gugatun, in Turkish territory: I came to Qizil Kend a month ago with others. We are nomadic and have no crops here. My chief is Dirbass. 2. I did not know that any camp had been pitched at Ashnok : it is true that it is only two miles away and the place can be seen from the hills close to our camp on which our flocks graze. 3. The reason we attacked the party was as follows :— We heard firing : we saw a party of men going down the nullah towards Persia from Turkey {sic): we thought they were Turkish soldiers so we fired on them. We could not see who they were for lack of light. We hate the Turks and fear them. 4. Por two years no Turks have come here : we have been in Turkey until last month at the invitation of Turkish military officials : they gave us wages, Jauzal Bey gave us 500 Liras last autumn. We had a man of our tribe killed in Turkey, but not by Turkish troops. 5. We have free intercourse with Turkey and often cross the frontier, but we are really Persian subjects. 6. We were in our tents when a shepherd said, “ The Turks are coming ”: I do not know the shepherd’s name. I took my gun, a Mauser, and went out. 7. I shot the Naib (Mr. Hubbard) at a range of 400 yards. I could not see who he was. I only fired one shot. After he was wounded I went to him and found he was an Englishman : I did not search him for money : I just buttoned his coat. I refused to help him back to the camp, because I was afraid, as I saw the Indians coming to help him. L I belong to the Muhammadi section of the Shakak tribe. I formerly Accused No. 2 . lived in Qizil Kend but I ran away from Agha Jan, sou of Maqsud Beg. p ersia f rom ^ and ^ ^ Duawan in Turkey. We are nomadic and have no crops here. My chief is Hirbass. 2. I did not know that any camp had been pitched at Ashnok : it is true that it is only two miles away and that the place can be seen from the hills close to our camp on which our flocks graze. 3. The reason we attacked the party was as follows:— A shepherd called Dirbass came and told us, “ The Turks had come, w T e have beard them shooting we came out and saw the party comino- from Turkey and fired on them. We could not see who they were 'or if they were armed, it was too dark: it is true that we had heard firing about an hour previously in the ravine but we had taken no notice; we just sat in our tents • then we came to the conclusion it must be an enemy. 4. For two years no Turks have come here : we have been in Turkey until last month at the invitation of Turkish military authorities : Turkish soldiers coming to attack us would not be likely to shoot partridges in \he ravine. &amp; « 5. We saw no one waving a turban at us, we only fired at 300 vards I only fired one shot, at the Naib. We did not iun after the party. As soon as I reacht d the Naib I ran away from fear : we were afraid to help. I did not see him: I was not present when men asked him for money. 6. lam really a Persian subject. 7. It was Muhammad who shot the Naib.7 1 and 2. As stated by accused No. 1. 3. I was near the tents when I heard firing: people said “ The Turks have come. ” 4. I went to fetch my horse which was near the village, so that I might go out and fight: when I arrived with my rifle, it was finished and every one said “ We have wounded a Russian .” 5. I did not see any one fire. I do not know why I was arrested. 6. I have no reason to fear the Turks : it is a long time since they have come here : when they were here they were on good terms with us. 1 and 2. As stated by accused No. 1. I was with my sheep away from Accused No. 4. camp and had no gun : when I reached Amar, son of saiim. the camp they told me they had shot an English officer : I do not know why I was arrested. 6.

I saw a man wounded and ran away: I did not go near. 5. I thought it was Turks. 6. We are on good terms with Ashnok. 7. When the Turks were here they did us no harm and the troops have not crossed the frontier for a long time. If they came, we should run away and not fight with them. Accused No 3.

Preliminary Medical Report on the nature of injuries received by Mr. G. K Hubbard, Levant Consular Service. Nature of These consist of the bullet wounds of the 1st and 2nd fingers of the rigut hand, and of the right thigh, all caused by the same bullet. The injury to the fingers was caused by the bullet passing between the 1st and 2nd fingers at the level of the 1st interphalangial joints. The skin was torn away right down to and exposing the extensor tendons in both fingers, but without exposing the bone. The wounds in both cases being about 1 inch long and ^ inch in width. The wound of the thigh is as follows:— The entrance wound is a circular punched out hole about fths of an inch in diameter situated on the outer and anterior aspect of the right thigh at the junction of the lower with the middle ^rd.; 8 The exit wound, of irregular oval shape, § inch in its long diameter, hy Hhs inch broad, is situated on the posterior to inner surface of the thigh, in the lower part of the middle ^rd, and opens on the surface over the hamstring muscles. ^ The great sciatic nerve is directly in the track of the bullet and has been severed in whole or part by it. There is complete paralysis of all muscles below the knee and complete loss of sensation in the foot below the level of the ankle. JPr&amp;SGnt condition of 31v. Hubbovd) 5th There is so far no suppuration in any of the wounds. The wound of the thigh, owing to the involvement of the great sciatic nerve, is exquisitely painful, the pain being referred entirely to the foot, and at times being so agonizing as to need morphia for its control, but, provided the wound heals^ well, this pain will gradually get much less, and will, I anticipate, finally disappear. He has had a slight temperature of ^ degree above normal each evening up to date. His general condition is good, and he eats well. Probable results of injuries.—The fingers will probably do well, and the most I anticipate from them is some temporary stiffness of the neighbouring joints. The wound of the thigh is of a more serious nature owing to the injury to the great sciatic nerve. This will require suturing when the wounds have healed, and it will be about 12 months under the most favourable circum stances before he can hope to regain sensation and power of movement in the areas supplied by the damaged nerve. I should add that, while the restoration of the function of the nerve is taking place, subsequent to its suture, he will be able to get about, although somewhat lame, and follow regular sedentary employment as well as if he did not suffer from any such temporary disability, but during this period he should be within easy reach of regular skilled massage. H. W. PlERPOINT, I.M.S., Medical Officer, Turko-Persian Frontier Commission, Sub-enclosure No. 4. Telegram, No. 22, dated the 5th September 1914. From—The British Commissioner, Turco-Persian Frontier Commission, To—The Foreign Office, London (repeated Tehran, Constantinople, India and Tabriz). Much regret to have to report Hubbard severely wounded by Kurds on 31st August, under following circumstances :— He went out with a partridge shooting party of four other British officers in a ravine close to camp at Ashnok of 20 miles south south-east Kotur, about ten miles east of frontier. He was himself unarmed. Local villagers had shewn themselves most friendly and had suggested shooting in ravine in question. When less than two miles from camp, party was suddenly attacked at close range by about ten Kurds from neighbouring encampment. About thirty aimed shots were fired, several at 50 yards range, in broad day-light. Bullet fired at 400 yards struck Hubbard passing between two fingers of right hand and damaging them but not severely and piercing right thigh. Latter wound severe, sciatic nerve being apparently severed. No other casualties. He is progressing favourably, but leg is of course paralysed, and it will be a long time before he regains use of it. In the meanwhile, it is absolutely essential he should have best possible medical attendance till he can reach London.9 ■ I have, therefore, in anticipation of sanction, directed Pierpoint accompanied by servant to proceed on duty in attendance on Hubbard to London by easy stages, as soon as latter is fit to travel. We hope to move him to Khoi in 4 or 5 days time and thence to Julfa by motor car en route Tiflis and Hatum. Six men implicated have been arrested and are in custody. I have taken their evidence and propose to send them with others, whom I hope to have captured shortly, to Tabriz via Khoi under guard with Captain Dyer. Motive for attack is not yet clear, but it seems plainly premeditated and to have been probably made by members of Persian nomad tribes of Muhammad Shikak, so as to get local Persian chief friendly to Kussians into trouble with latter for whom tribesmen appear to have mistaken us. Copies of evidence and all available details will be sent to Sir W. Townley and British Consul, Tabriz, for further necessary action. Detailed despatch follows. At time of occurrence I was with my colleagues on a Sub-Commission on difficult part of frontier, some 30 miles off, and only heard of it yesterday on my return, messenger having failed to reach me, hence delay in reporting matter. Please inform Mrs. Hubbard, Townfield, Hayes End, Middlesex, by letter of above with expression my profound regret and sympathy.

In The Under Secretary of State, India Office.-L-s view, however, of the precarious condition of the Persian exchequer, it appears improbable that the claim can be paid immediately, while on the other hand lb would not be desirable that Mr. Hubbard should be expected, to bear the expenditure which has been incurred tnrough his presence with the Commission. I am, therefore, to express the hope that Lord Crewe will share Sir E.

W. Pierpoint, I.M.S., on his present condition » 2. On 29th Augist I left Barduk with a Sub-Commissior to erect pillars upon the watershed between Barduk and Kotur. The roads being difficult, and it being necessary to pass into Turkish territory, which I was anxious to avoid doing with a large caravan, owing to the mobiliza tion now proceeding at Bashkaleh and the consequent general perturbation and lack of supplies, I requested Colonel Ryder Che Right Honourable Sir Edward Grey, Bart., K.G., M.P., &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.Colonel Ryder to proceed with the rest of the British Commission to Khaniga via Chehrik, staying a day near Dilman to collect supplies* He did so, and on 31st August reached Ashnok, on his way from Dilman to Khanigah. 3. On the afternoon of the same day the British officers of the camp all went out to shoot partridges, as we have habitually done for the past ten months, and it was whilst they were out shooting, less than two miles from camp, in a ravine which had been pointed out to them by local .villagers, that the incident occurred, under the circumstances mentioned in my above telegram, and detailed in the enclosures to this despatch* 4. It was not until September 3rd that I heard from Colonel Ryder, who came to Khaniga for the purpose, of the occurrence, several letters sent to me having miscarried* 5* I should however mention that a rumour reached me at Burushkuva- and again a.t Keshgul on the afternoon of September 1st that a Russian officer, or cossack, had been wounded by Persian Kurds, subjects of Ismail Agha, the Persian tribal chief in charge of the Kotur, Dilman and Somai districts, and I was assured that this had been done by the Kurds to get this chief, who was friendly to the Russians,Rusoians, into trouble with the letter. I mentioned the rumour to Monsieur Minorsky , hut took no further action, 6. I reached camp on the evening of the 3rd Septenfcer ana at once sent for Ismail Agha: he had already visited Colonel Ryder, and had arrested six men belonging to the encampment and village close to which the affair had occurred. 7. On the 4th September I held a Court of Enquiry Vide enclo sure 1. and took sworn depositions of two officers concerning the incident; this procedure is perhaps somewhat irregular but it seemed the most expeditious and effective method of placing on record formal evidence which could be cited in case of necessity in a Persian Court of Law. To these ^ depsitions I added, on September 5th, those of MrlHubbard. 8. I requested Colonel Ryder to take the rest of the British Commission to Kotur via Khaniga, I myself remaining behind to enquire into the affair and to arrange for Mr. Hubbard's removal to Khoi as soon as his condition permitted. 9. On the afternoon of the 4th September Ismail Agha arrived, with the six men he had arrested. I examined Vide enclo sure 2. them and recorded the purport of their statements. Mr.f eb i* eius &gt;• Mr. Hubbard’s condition did not permit of their being paraded before him for identification. 10. I will mot at present attempt to comment on their evidence in detail, but I may remark that the excuse for firing on our party advanced by them that they thought they were Turks, seems plainly to be an afterthought, as Mr. Hubbard’s evidence indicates clearly that they mistook our party for Russians. It will be noted that it has been admitted in evidence that they heard firing for an hour without taking any action (the encampment was only 400 yards f from the ravine): it wa.s broad day-light (5.50 p.m.) all the party were dressed distinctively, and could not have been mistaken for Turks; Major Cowie's party, who were fired on first, were moving up the nullah towards Turkey from Persia: the presence of the detachments of the Frontier Commission in the neighbourhood was well known to every one, and its movements had been discussed for months past: 3 or 4 small parties had been for a fortnight within 20 miles of this place engaged in survey and other work at different points, and had passed close by. All this must have been perfectly well known to the tribesmen, especially toto those who (like those now implicated) have recently been domiciled on the Turkish side, where all guards have been strengthened and additional posts established during the last three months in anticipation of our arrival. 11. The first remarks of the Kurds to Mr. Hubbard (vide his evidence) coupled with the form in which the rumour first reached me (vide paragraph 5), and considered in the light of information which has reached me regarding Ismail Agha's relations with the Muhammadi Shikak and other tribes, and regarding his relations with the Russians, tend to confirm the opinion recorded in my telegram of 5th September, that the outrage was committed by the tribesmen of the Muhammadi Shikak clan with the object of embroiling Ismail Agha (who has frequently looted them) with his friends the Russians, to whom he owes his present position and influence, Russian friendship having taken, I under stand, the substantial form of a present of 1,000 rifles with ammunition. £ 12. It is interesting in this connexion to recall that Monsieur Yedensky, Russian Vice-Consul at Urmi, and i Monsieur Minorsky, both told me some weeks ago that their quondam friend and protege Ismail Agha was now under a cloud.cloud, owing to his unauthorized depredations on his neighbours, and to the improper advantage he had taken of the support the Russian authorities had accorded him, and that his actions were being made the subject of an enquiry. 13• Present c ond ition of Mr. Hubbard . Enclosure No.2. I can add nothing to Captain Pierpoint’s lucid report on this subject: Mr. Hubbard has shewn throughout the greatest fortitude and patience, bearing unmurmuringly the continuous pain which he has been suffering. It is and when he will reach England: information on these points will be submitted periodically by telegraph. 14• Betributorv action against guilty parties. This question is not one with which I am competent to deal. I hope to send as many implicated persons as possible to Tabriz to be dealt with there by the local authorities in communication with His Majesty's Consul, Tabriz, with whom I am in direct communication on the subject. I venture to hope that His Majesty's Government will cause such representations to be made to the Persian Govern ment as will ensure the exemplary punishment of those responsible for the outrage and the provision of adequate impossible at present to say when and how we can move him, compensation rcompensation for Mr. Hubbard. The incident is ascribable directly to the neglect of the Persian Groverninent and of the local Azarbaijan authorities to take any steps to ensure the safety of the Frontier Commission whilst in Persian territory. Whilst the Turks have doubled or trebled their frontier posts, and seen that every village near the frontier was notified of our arrival and, generally, occupied by a squad of Turkish soldiers. The Persian local authorities on the other hand have sent no repres entative with us, and have taken no action of any sort; the application for a guard to the Governor of Dilman, which Colonel Ryder made as a matter of routine, was ignored (the single Cossack provided deserting half way) nor did Ismail Agha, who had been warned in writing several days beforehand of our arrival with his district (i.e* from Sero and from Burduk, by Monsieur Minorsky) take any steps to depute representatives to accompany us. 15. In conclusion I venture, with great respect, to record my opinion that the action of all officers con cerned, from first to last, in connexion with this unfortunate occurrence was unexceptionable, and that the incidentincident cannot be attributed to any lack of foresight or prudence on the part of any of them. 1 trust, Sir, that after perusal of the evidence and other documents annexed to this despatch, you will see no reason to differ from this conclusion. 16.

Proceedings of a Court of Enquiry held at Ashnok near Dilman on September 4th, 1914, to enquire into the circumstances under which Mr. Gr. E. Hubbard, Levant Consular Service was wounded. Lieutenant-Colonel C.H.D. Ryder, D.S.O., R.E., being duly sworn states as follows On the 31st August, 1914 the British Commission camped near the village of Ashnok arriving about noon. A Persian Cossack sent by the Oovernor of Dilman, in response to my request for a guard, went into a village en route (Nazirawa) and did not appear again. The inhabitants of a Kurdish camp close by were most helpful and made themselves useful to us in many ways. We asked them whether there were any partridges near and they pointed out a ravine close to our camp. About 4 p.m. we went out to shoot partridges: the party included Major Cowie ) Captain Brooke ) with shot guns, and myself ) Mr. Hubbard unarmed. 10 sowars and khalasis, unarmed, as beaters. 1 i m , 1 We&lt;*6 proceedeo. up the ravine for three-quarter miles where it divideo into two: Major Gowie, Captain Brooke and five men followeo the left hand branch, the rest of the party taking the right hand branch. Both branches were deep, and divided from each other by a spur 400 feet high, so that neither party could see or hear what was going on in the adjoining ravine. After following our branch for about three-quarter mile, finding no birds, we decided to return (we were then less than half hour from camp), Mr. Hubbard also returning to camp, along the spur, between the two parties. After we had followed down the ravine for ten minutes eight to ten men appeared on the slopes of the spur between the two ravines (down stream from Mr. Hubbard) on our flank and at once opened fire on us at 250 yards advancing at the same time. The fire was deliberately aimed, several shots passing quite close to us. I could see them clearly and there could be no doubt that they could also see us clearly. I decided to retire to camp as quickly as possible to seek assistance in case the Major Cowie's party should be involved. On arrival near camp I sawthat Major Cowie’s party had reached camp before me and were already returning to our assistance. Mr. Hubbard however (whom I had not been able to see on the crest of the spur from the bottom of the ravine) had not arrived and I therefore sent out Captain Brooke, officer comnanding escort, Captain Pierpoint ,1 ,M.S., and ten sowars and several men from the neighbouring encampment of Ashnok to search for him. They brought him in an hour later. On arrival at camp I sent a letter to Ismail Agha who reached my camp next afternoon accompanied by a hundred men. He sent to the encampment of Qizil. Kend, close to C which the incident had occurred, and two hours later brought six men into our camp. They at first denied that they were concerned; they were taken aside by Ismail Agha and after a short time, the latter informed me in Persian in their presence that they had confessed that they had taken *&gt;art in the attack on us. Their demeanour was calm and they shewed no signs of having been subjected to pressure with a view to extort confession: this state ment was received without comment by the prisoners. Ismail Agha then asked me what I wished done with them.them. I told him to keep them prisoners till he had communicated with the authorities at Khoi and received orders from them. In reply to a query from me as to why the attack had taken place Ismail Agha stated that the men had asserted that they believed us to be Turks. Read over and acknowledged correct. (Signed) C. H. D.

Brooke being duly sworn states as foilows:- After proceeding three quarter mile up the ravine near camp our party divided into two, Major Cowie and myself with five men followed the left hand branch the lest of the party taking the right hand branch. We moved up the ravine, in which birds were plentiful shooting as we went: Major Cowie with two men on my right on the north bank of the ravine, myself along the bed of the ravine with three men beating above me on my left. After going half a mile whilst still moving up the ravine, we were arranging to surround a covey, a shot was fired on the bank above me: the sowar Hakim Khan who was furthest up the bank to my left began shouting that he was a friend and waving Mb turban and telling some one not to fire. Up to this moment 1 thought that it was a Ktfrdish sportsman who had come to join us, as not infrequently happens: shortly after this I saw a Kurd deliberately fire several shots at this sowar at a range ofof about 50 yards and miss him. At that moment some four or five more men appeared on the top of the spur to ny left front with a- dog. Major Cowie then shouted to me that it was time to go, so I told the men to return to camp and myself with three men ran up the opposite slope towards Major Cowie and got into camp shortly after him: the Kurds fired a few shots at us as we retired. The firing on us was deliberately aimed throughout: they followed us to within sight of the camp. Just after I got in Colonel Ryder’s party arrived, with the exception of Mr. Hubbard and I at once took steps under Colonel Ryder's orders to go out with ten men to look for Mr. Hubbard.

We went up vice, 5th September,1914. a large ravine for forty minutes shooting steadily to a point where the ravine branched: thence I accompanied Colonel Ryder and Captain Pierpoint up the right hand branch and saw Major Cowie and Captain Brooke go up the other branch. After continuing about 20 minutes up the said i ravine, I left Colonel Ryder saying that I intended to climb / on to the ridge separating our ravine from that in which Major Cowie was. I intended to go to them to see what luck they were having and return with them, I saw Colonel Ryder and Captain Pierpoint start walking down the ravine towards camp. As I went up the slope I heard the discharge of a rifle, but this being a very frequent an occurrence in this country I attached no special significance to it. When I reached the top of the ridge I could see across Major Cowie’s ravine to a nomad encampment a quarter mile the otherother side end I saw a small group of six to eight aimed men on the further edge of the nullah shouting and running about. I went a little way towards the ravine to try and see Major Gowie’s party and suddenly felt myself hit in the leg and fell. I got up and tried to return on the ridge but after going a few yards a second bullet hit the ground near me. I then lay down on the grouno and waited. After some time 4 or 5 Kurds came to me from the direction of Major Gowie’s ravine, 1 talked to them out haa difficulty in understanding their dialect and in making my seif under stood: I said 'I am not a Russian” and they appeared surprised and questioned me again and again saying “are you not a Russian?” , and they shouted to each other some thing about “Russians”: during this time men were coming and going between where I was and the encampment. They asked me for money and one of them felt in one pocket and removed a letter but they did not rifle my person. They were evidently in doubt what to do. They asked ‘who shot you?” several times. They finally lefu me. I heard a shot fired, undoubtedly by them, shortly after. At the moment I was shot it was broad dayli^at and I can swear itwas not later than 5.45 as I had looked at ray watch when 1 started to climb the ridge. My impression is that it was not later than 5.50. 1 stayed alone rather over half an hour till I was found by a party from our camp, which was accompanied by some villagers from Ashnok.

Preliminary Medical Report on the nature of injuries received by Mr. Gr.E. Hubbard, Levant Consular Service. Nature of wounds * These consist of the bullet wounds of the 1st and 2nd fingers of the right hand, and of the right thigh, all caused by the same bullet. / ( The injury to the fingers was caused by the bullet ' passing between the 1st and 2nd fingers at the level of the 1st interphalangial joints. The skin was torn away right down to and exposing the extensor tendons in both fingers, but without exposing the bone. The wounds in both cases being about one inch long and three quarter inch in width. The wound of the thigh is as follows The entrance wound is a circular punched out hole about three-eighths of an inch in diameter situated on the outer and anterior aspect of the right thigh at the junc- tion of the lower with the middle one-third. The exit wound, of irregular oval shape, half inch in its long diameter by three-eighths inch broad ia situatedsituated on the posterior to inner surface of the thigh, in the lower part of the middle l/3rd, and opens on the surface over the hamstrong muscles. The Great Sciatic Nerve is directly in the track of the bullet and has been severed in whole or part by it. There is complete paralysis of all muscles below the knee and complete loss of sensation in the foot below the level of the ankle. Present condition of Mr. Hubbard. September 5th . There is so far no suppuration in any of the wounds. The wound of the thigh, owing to the involvement of the Great Sciatic Nerve, is exquisitely painful, the pain being referred entirely to the foot, and at times being so agonizing as to need morphia for its control, but, provided the wound heals well, this pain will gradually get much less and will I anticipate finally disappear. He has had a slight temperature of i degree above normal each evening up to date. His general condition is good and he eats well. Probable results of injuries . The fingers will probably do well, and the most I anticipate' anticipate from them is some temporary stiffness of the neighbouring joints. The wound of the thigh is of a more serious nature owing to the injury to the Great Sciatic Nerve. This will require suturing when the wounds have healed and it will be about 12 months under the most favourable circumstances before he can hope to regain sensation and power of movement in the areas supplied by the damaged nerve* I should add that while the restoration of the function of the nerve is taking place, subsequent to its suture, k Sje will be able to get about, although somewhat lame, and follow regular sedentary employment as well as if he did not suffer from any such temporary disability, but during this period he should be within easy reach of regular skilled massage.

Turco-Persian Frontier Commission.Telegram from British Commissioner, Turco-Persian Frontier Commission* To Foreign Office, London* Dated 5th September, 1914. No. 22. Repeated Tehran, Constantinople, India and Tabriz. Much regret to have to report Hubbard severely wounded by Kurds on August 31st under following circum - stances. He went out with a partridge shooting party of 4 other British officers in a ravine close to camp at Ashnok 20 miles S.S.S. Kotur about 10 miles S. of frontier. He was himself unarmed. Local villagers had shewn themselves most friendly and had suggested shooting in ravine in ques tion. When less than 2 miles from camp party was suddenly attacked at a close range by about ten Kurds from neigh- bouring encampments. About thirty aimed shots were fired several at 50 yards range in broad day light. Bullet fired at 400 yards struck Hubbard passing between two fingers of right hand and damaging them but not severely and piercing right thigh. Latter wound severe sciatic nerve being apparently severed. No other casualties. He is progressing favourably but leg is of course paralysed and it will be a long time before he regains use of it. In the meanwhile it is absolutely essential he should have best possible medical attendance till he can reach London. I have therefore in anticipation of sanction directed Pierpoint accompanied by servant to proceed on duty in attendanceattendance on Hubbard to London by easy stages, as soon as latter is fit to travel. We hope to move him to Khoi in 4 or 5 days' time and thence to Julfa by motor car en route Tiflis and Batun. Six men implicated have been arrested and are in custody* I have taken their evidence and propose to send them with others who I hope to have captured shortly to Tabriz via Khoi under guard with Captain Dyer. Motive for attack is not yet clear but it seems clearly premeditated and to have been probably made by members of Persian nomad trices of Muhammad Shikak sornas to get local Persian chief friendly to Russians into trouble with latter for whom tribesmen appear to have mistaken us. Copies of evidence and all available details will be sent to Sir W. Townley and V British Consul Tabriz for further necessary action.

Following on the enquiry referred to in paragraph 7 of my above despatch, I caused 4 more men to be arrested by Ismail Aghat an abstract of their evidence given by than has been sent direct to His Majesty’s Consul, ^abria. Whilst they denied all complicity, their statements tended to confirm the conclusions summarized in paragraph 10 of my above ■ despatch. These men, together with the 8 men first arrested, were sent to Khoi, to be detained in custody pending further orders. 3 . By September 8 th, Mr. Hubbard’s condition had improved sufficiently to make it possible to move him, and he was transported in an improvised stretcher by sowars of this escort, in 2 stages, to Dilnan, by a difficult hill path. After a day's rest there he was transported to Khoi by Russian ambulance waggon, in 3 stages, but not without much suffering, owing to the The Right Honourable Sir Edward Orey, Bart., K.G., M.P*, etc., etc©, etc©.

It remains to be considered what compensation is due to Mr* Hubbard for the severe injuries he has received, and from wtgKfc 1 it should be claimed by His Majesty’s Oovemraent. The incident having taken place in Persian territory, and the perpetrators being a Persian tribe, I think there can be no doubt that the Persian Government should be held responsible for Hie payment ©f compensation! the amount that should be ax?u must depend largely upon the final medical report upon Mr* Hubbard’s condition after the necessary operation has been per formed* I venture however to recall the following precedents!?*** (1) Captain Lorimer, His Majesty’s Vloe-Oonsui Ahwas^and Major J.A* Douglas^Military Attache'Tehran, severely wounded in 1904 In Luristani compensation was paid by Treasury and demanded later on from Persian Government. Captain Lorinor also, I understand, received leave on full pay whilst under medical treatment at home. Major Douglas was subsequently awarded a wound allowance of £100 a year which I believe he still draws* (2) Mr. Bmart, Acting Oonsul, Shiraz, slightly wounded, in 1911* £1000 was demanded from Persian.

Assuming that the delicate and difficult operation of suturing the nerve is accomplished satisfactorily, it will under the moat favourable circumstances be nearly two years before his par allied leg will be fully cured, and for the whole of this time it will require massage and electric treatment, costly necessities obtain able only In England. Besides this, the shock to his nervous system has been very severe. He has had five weeks of almost continuous and excruciating pain, and his journey from Khoi to England cannot fail under present circumstances to be very uncomfortable and exhausting. 7. Having regard to all the facts of the case, I venture to think that £2600 would be a by no means excessive sum to demand from the Persian (Government who, I learn from Sir Walter Townley, have admitted their liability by an offer of 3000 francs, being doubtlesei under the Impression that the wound was only a slight one.

It must be at least two years before complete recovery can be expected, and it is quite possible that there will always be some weakness.
