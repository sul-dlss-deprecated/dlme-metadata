Possible candidates were from the Iraq Levies and units of the Indian Army. The Sultan wished to have a young officer with Arabic language skills and experience of working with Arabs. Due to the state of Muscat finances there was uncertainty as to whether to appoint a commandant to the Muscat Levy Corps. Letters discuss the combination of the post of Financial Adviser and Commandant of Muscat Levies to be approved by the State Council and Sayid Sa'id bin Taimur [Sa‘īd bin Taymūr]. A further idea is to have a Royal Engineer Sapper Officer who would also be able to advise on the construction of roads and other engineering schemes.Correspondents include Captain George J Eccles; Captain Allan Robertson Walker; Captain Roderick Lewis O'Connor; Captain F M Booth; Captain Brian Carver Rigden; Captain Dorien Dudley H Johnston; Captain Horation John Hare; Major Reginald Merry; Major Trenchard Craven Fowle, Political Agent Muscat; Major Claude Edward U Bremner, Political Agent Muscat; Lieutenant-Colonel Gordon Loch, Political Resident Persian Gulf; Saiyid Said bin Taimur, Sultan of Muscat and Oman; Charles Walton, India Office, London.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Commander of the Muscat Regiment</namePart></name></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0001ad#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
