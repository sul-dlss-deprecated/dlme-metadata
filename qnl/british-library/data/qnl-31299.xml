Yours faithfully, IMPERIAL AIR a AYSMIMITiD.,1 Major R.P.Watts, Political Agent and H.B.M’s Consul General, Mu scat. Dear Sir, I wrote to you on the 30th March enclosing a cheque for Hs 480/- in settlement of the rent of our petrol store and the wages of the care-taker at Shinas for the period June 1S35 to May 1937. I have now heard from the Manager of our Iraq Area that he wishes to dispense with the services of the care-taker at Shinas forthwith. It may, however, take some time to get in touch with this man and I shall be grateful if you will arrange for his services to be dispensed with.as from 30th April. With regard to the petrol under his charge at Shinas it seems that this may be of no further use to us and the question of disposal has arisen. Our records show that approximately 148 gallons are held in stock there and I wonder if Kis Highness the Sultan would be interested in making an offer for this stock. Perhaps he might be prepared to take over the petrol as an offset against the rental and wages at Shinas for the period subsequent to May 1937 and in this event the question of disposal would be easily settled.

For this purpose arrangements have already been made to send to MUSCAT a small quantity of cement which will be shipped to SHINAS under arrangements to be made by Squadron Leader Coates. 3. During this visit it is intended that Squadron Leader Coates should also carry out a reconnaissance in the vicinity of MUSCAT in order to find a landing ground more suitable for modern aircraft than the present one at BAIT-AL-FALAJ. 4.

I enclose a copy of a rough sketch showing proposed extension and remarks by 84 Squadron who suggested it You will see the idea is to enable the aircraft to get a longer run in SE-NW, and S.W. - N.E. dire*tions • An extension in an easterly direction is almost imppossible as greater run would be required to make up for the space wasted by the hfight at al which aircraft reach the Western boundary of the landing ground owing to their having to clear the date palms. You] Captain T.Hickinbotham H.B.M's Political Agent, Muscat.SHINAS Approaches Any approach to the sea must be made over date palms. A small bund, about one foot high, defines the boundary B-C ofc- the landing ground. Surface. i*he surface is absolutely level, and exteremely smooth. Prevailing Wind. The wind is generally blowing either to or from sea. Extensions. The side A-E can be extended between G and l by about 3oo yards or more to m-N. This will necessiate the removal of a small Wadi, shown in the diagram. nemarks. The small bund C—B might prove dangerous to aircraft approaching over the palm trees, jieween the bund C-B and the palms there is evidence of flooding, and it is believed that the removal of the bund might cauec flooding of the landing grpund during winter. .between the points 1 and A the boundary is rough and the groujiu rises slightly away from the landing ground. Fairly extensile recons truction would be required to extend the landing gxmuidt area between these points.:«-^i - 2 - i ?r\ Jb ; .1 j—*' j *—«jl^i»-».) ^ ..Ull I jl (jjJ Qjyjlji.) «&lt;ill fjt &lt;**&gt;w ^ Xm • V* jl l^-i^ljl; I_J «_l **' »&lt; j^ji ljLy« j^-1— &gt;*l dj+ oL^iJL X- fj—* J—^je u* ^ J—UJ j -*UJl c-jpi IJi ^ .XJ j rt ..ir»»^Jl v^&lt; ^ j ^ {fit **** j Uy. \ .I 4 .il ) 1 ^ p J ^Jl p^I -*ia* ijc J.n, m *» p bj ■ *X ft • ^ S^UU^jl LOL&gt;JL-»-l * jJ* «** / % 4. For the same reasons the Bait-al- Falaj ground is unsatisfactory and the Squadron Leader has been instructed to examine the possibility of improving the present site or selecting an alternative one. He believes that saw when last he was in Muscat he\ a likely place between Matrah and Hagar and proposes to examine the place more carefully. Your Highness will understand that there is no definite intention at present of moving the landing ground but should it be found necessary and possible then Your Highness will be consulted immediately with regard to the alternative site. 5. Squadron Leader Coates proposes to send his luggage and stores by sea to Shinas and to go there himself by taxi on Saturday the 8th July. He hopes to spend the night at Khaburah. Before leaving he would like to call on Your Highness and I shall be very glad if Your Highness will let me know what day, time and place will be suitable.
