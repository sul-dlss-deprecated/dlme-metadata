The flat underside contains an inscription with the throne name of Amenophis III (1388-1351/1350 BCE) and a power loaded epithet. The design on the back is very detailed, with deelpy incised lines and regular flow. The piece is carefully made and the workmanship is good. \r\n\r\nThis piece functioned as an individualized protective amulet, and would have originally been mounted or threaded. The amulet should secure royal authority and strength for the king, and guarantee for a private owner his royal patronage and protection. \r\n\r\nThe unusual size of the epithet in comparison to the name of the king underlines the protective function of the scarab. Together with the cryptographic reading of the cartouche as Amun it expresses that the god is the \"Lord of strength,\" that my explain the unusual size of the epithet.", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters, 1929", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/36721", "Keywords": null, "Provenance": "Henry Walters, Baltimore, 1929 [mode of acquisition unknown]; Walters Art Museum, 1931, by bequest.", "Dynasty": "18th Dynasty", "Reign": "Amenophis III (1388-1351/1350 BC)", "OnView": 0, "PublicAccessDate": "2009-09-11T09:35:05.56", "Creator": "Egyptian", "PrimaryImage": {"Tiny": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CUR_42.80_Bot_DD_RS2009.jpg?width=50", "Small": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CUR_42.80_Bot_DD_RS2009.jpg?width=100", "Medium": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CUR_42.80_Bot_DD_RS2009.jpg?width=150", "Large": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CUR_42.80_Bot_DD_RS2009.jpg?width=250", "Raw": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CUR_42.80_Bot_DD_RS2009.jpg"}, "GeoIDs": "1543485", "ExhibIDs": "", "Images": "CUR_42.80_Back_DD_RS2009.jpg, CUR_42.80_Bot_DD_design_RS2009.jpg, CUR_42.80_Bot_DD_RS2009.jpg, CUR_42.80_Rt_DD_RS2009.jpg, CUR_42.80_VwA_DD_hieroglyphictext_RS2009.jpg, CUR_42.80_VwA_DD_TranscriptionRS2009.jpg", "DisplayLocation": "Not On View"}
