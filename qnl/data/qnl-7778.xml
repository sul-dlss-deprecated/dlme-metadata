In the correspondence Stewart suggests that such an appointment would be preferable to the present arrangement, which requires the person currently in charge of the office of Political Officer at Hodeidah, namely Stewart's First Assistant Resident in Aden, to engage in 'avoidable correspondence' with the Political Clerk at Hodeidah, since he is not able to leave his duties in Aden.The principal correspondents are the Political Resident at Aden, the Secretary of State for the Colonies (Leopold Stennett Amery), and various officials of the Colonial Office and Foreign Office.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Aden</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Colonial Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for the Colonies, United Kingdom</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Hodeidah</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Consular services</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000278#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
