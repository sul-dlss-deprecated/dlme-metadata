MacLeod gives the procedure to be carried out by the cruizers' officers for revising and renewing registers of Arab vessels. He authorises the Senior Officer to grant or refuse all registers at his discretion. In urgent cases, temporary registers are to be granted at the discretion of cruizer officers until a regular register can be procured. Following absences from the ports, cruizer officers should take the earliest opportunity to go ashore to ascertain which vessels have arrived or departed, and, if any do not hold valid registers, the officer is instructed to warn the shaikh of the danger of the violation of the Treaty and to report these incidents to MacLeod or the Senior Officer. MacLeod informs the Senior Officer that he has been directed by Government to warn him against launching any attack on 'not piratical' chiefs and should avoid committing hostilities without previous sanction in any case short of piracy. MacLeod also mentions the possible arrangement of providing a native agent at some of the principal ports who will provide information, assist in procuring supplies and act as interpreter. In the meantime, MacLeod authorises officers to employ persons as they may require to assist them in their work.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023673714.0x000020#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
