W. 1. 10th January, 1934, , ^ Sir, /P'' 7 I am directed by Secretary Sur John Simon to request you to inform Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare that he has &amp;&amp; had under / consideration a statement contained in paragraph 7 of Mr. Mallet’s telegram No. 26b of the Ibth October , a cJopy of which is enclosed, to the effect that the Persian Minister for For eign Affa^rs recently claimed a teii-mile limit for Persain terr itorial waters. 2. As Sir Samuel Hoare is aware, there is no international agreement laying down the limit of territorial waters for all countries. His Uajestyls Government in the United Kingdom claim three m iles only, but Persia is by no means alone in claiming more; indeed at the Grnference forthe Codification of International Law held at the Hague in 1930, while most of the i important maritime stat^ s claimed no more thf%/ three miles, t:.ey in a fliinority. At that Conference, it may be recalled, t e Persain representatives claimed a limit of six miles |Ubis plus an adjacent zone, the breadth of which does not appear to have been specified. Although the a ersAan representative did not himself give any explanation of the prupose for which this adjacent zone was claimed by his c vernment , the majority of other States which put forward a similar claim on this occasio* made it clear that they required the adjacent zone partly at least for purposes of customs control. The Under Secretary bf State, v India Office.ty :2s. The ten mile limit recently claimed by the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs appears at first sight to be incompatible with the clainjmade in 1930 by the Persian representative at the Conference, but it may well be that Kazemi had in mind the adjacent zone when mentioning the higher figure. Whatever may be theprecise wxtent of the Persia- n claim , it is evident that if ti includes an adjacent zone it cannot be far short of the ten-mile limit. 4. In t he t bsence of any international agreement, it is, in Sir John Simon’s view, impossible to base a refusal to accept the Persian trovernmentfe claim to a ten-mile limit upon the international position • Not would it appear disirable to base such a refusal upon tfeefact that the Persian claim at the 1930 conference was not to a ten mile limit, since to do so **** would go near to bring an acceptance of the claim to a six mile limit and an adjacent zone, which would be contrarey to the g wx gpura general policy of His Maj estyle u overnment in t e United Kn 'ingdom on the subject, In these circumstances, it cannot be expected that the Persian drovernment will admit the justice c of any complaints regarding interference with shipping by the Persian coast, in cases where it would be a sound defence that the action was taken within the limits of Persian territor- i&lt;'tl waters • It appears therefoe to Sie John tiimon that , while peotests should in such cases continue to be made in order to safeguard trie principle of a three mile limit, His Majesty’s Government ha¥e no means of enforcing their view.» FflRgpBPiSy ■' ■ Pf s \ ;[ % — • &gt; 3 : • 5* Subject to the concurrence of Sir Samuel Hoare Sir John Simon proposes to inform His Majesty’s Minister at xehran ofthe position as set forth above for his guidance § and he suggests that it may be desirable that the Political J*«xi Resident in the Peri^n sulf should take steps to warn the masters of vesnels from the Arab states ofthe Persian Gulf in sx* suitable terms of the practical effects of the Persian xHx claim to ten-mile limit of territorial waters* 6. ^similar letter is beir« sent to th©Admiralty* I am, Gir, Your obedient^ervant* Sd.

Sir, /ith reference to my despatch No.28 of the 5th April, I transmit to you herewith a copy of a despatch from the Foreign Office regarding the attitude to be adopted by His Majesty’s Government in the event of the arrest of a British subject at the outer anchorage at Bushire. 2. Subject to any observations which you may wish to offer, particularly with regard to the proposed definition of the outer anchorage, 1 would propose to reply that I agree that the best course, in the particular circumstances existing at Bushire, is that suggested in paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Foreign Office despatch, and that I also agree that no communication need be made to the Iranian Government until a concrete case arises. It is undesirable to enter upon a barren controversy with the Iranian Government over this question, and I consider that this will be best achieved by adopting the course proposed in paragraphs 3 to 5 of the Foreign Office despatch. I would suggest that it should be understood that if a case arises involving Iranian juris diction over a British subject on a ship at the outer anchorage, His Majesty's Legation should at once be informed by telegraph, so that the necessary communication can be made to the Iranian Government without delay. It does not seem necessary that a similar communication should be made simultaneously to the Governor of Bushire. ^• Before replying to the Foreign Office on these lines, I should be glad to learn whether you wish to offer any further observations in the light of the despatch of which a copy is enclosed. 4 / O.K.Caroe Esquire, C.I.E., # ' The Acting Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.3./ IS Copy. No.389 (E 5852/653/34). FOREIGN OFFICE,S.W.l. 18tn October, 1937. 3ir, I have had under cone ideration your despatch Ho. 128 (4/5/37) of the 5th April regarding the arrest by the Hersian authorities of a member of the crew of tne German 3.3.Geierfels after being involved in an affray with Persian coolies on board that vessel while it was lying at tne outer anchorage at Bushire, and in which you requested instructions regarding the attitude which His Majesty's Government proposed to adopt in the event of a British subject being arrested by the Persian authorities in corresponding circumstances. 2. After carefully weighing the various considerations put forward in your despatch under reference, I am of tne opinion that for practical reasons it is desirable that Persian juris diction should be recognised over tne outer anchorage of the Persian port of Bushire. Owing to tne snallowness or tne harbour, this is a place where sea-going vessels perform the operations which they would normally perform inside a port, and in so far as foreign vessels g 0 there for the purpose of establishing contact with the shore, and to tnat end admit Persian officials on board, they must be assumed to accept some measure of Persian jurisdiction. At the same time, it seems desirable to find a way of meeting tne practical needs of this situation which does not prejudice tne position wnicn nis 'fejesty's Government have ta*en up with regard to tne limits of territorial waters and, in particular, does not imply any recognition by His Majesty's Government of tne Persian claim to a s ix-mile limit (or in exceptional circumstances twelve miles) or a contiguous zone.3 — 2 - In these circumstancesi I consider that the difficulty could best be met, if Hia ^Jesty’s aorernment were to take the line tnat, in view of the special circumatancee obtaining at Buahire, they intend, ao far as they are concerned, to regard the outer anchorage as being under Persian jurisdiction in the same manner as if the anchorage were part of the Persian port of Bushire, and that snips going there will accordingly be deemed to be in the same position as if they were in Persian national waters. This method appears prefer able to one involving any attempt to negotiate a special agreement with the Persian Government in regard to the outer ancho^rage at Bushire, more especially as that Government clearly could not be expected to accept a proposal for sucn an agreement, the conclusion of which would be completely inconsistent with the attitude which they have always main tained regarding the limits of Persian territorial waters. 4. If this policy is to serve its purpose, it ought to be communicated officially to the Persian Government. The communication would be a statement of the view which Hia JlaJ esty* s Government had decided unilaterally to adopt with regard to this matter, and would contain a definition of what they conceived to be the geographical limits of tne anchorage. I am advised that a simple definition wnicn would be adequate for this purpose would be 'an area within one mile of tne chartered position of tne Guter Anchorage light buoy'. 1 shall be glad if you will consider this suggestion, if necessary in consultation with tne acting Political Resident in tne Persian Gulf, and furnish me with your opinion on it in due course. 5. A further point requiring consideration is that of the t irae /3- time at wiiicti the proposed coimnunication which is to be addressed to the Persian Government should be made in order best to serve the purpose in view. In general, I consider that little would be gained by making this communication before the particular circumstances which would render it necessary nave arisen, and it might b© best to wait until a concrete case of the kind contemplated in tne last sentence of paragraph 2 of your despatch under reference has occurred. Nevertheless, I am prepared to leave it entirely to your discretion to decide cn the time and manner of making such a communication, and you are authorised to take such action at any time when, in the light of local considerations, it may appear desirable.
