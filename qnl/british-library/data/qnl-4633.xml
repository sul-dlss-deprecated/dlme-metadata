I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your office endorsement No. 2179 and of your First Assistant’s letter No. 2180, dated the 9th October 1907, forwarding copies of Foreign Office telegrams addressed to Secretary of State, and dated, respectively, 24th September 1907 and 4th October 1907 and 8th October 1907, and the telegraphic reply from the Secretary of State, dated 2nd October 1907, on the subject of the negotiations for the lease of the Bunder Shweikh lands. 2. I have now the honour to report that the lease was duly signed in my presence by Sheikh Mubarak and witnesssed by his son, Sheikh Jabir, and delivered to me on the evening of the 15th October. The Arabic original of the lease has been forwarded direct to the Foreign Secretary with translation and a copy of this letter, as directed in Foreign telegram, dated 15th August, to my address, forwarded under cover of your office confidential endorsement No. 1775, dated 17th August 1907. 3. A true copy of the lease has been retained by me in my personal custody for record, and I trust that by next mail I shall be able to forward a copy thereof to you. A translation accompanies this letter. 4 . On the same evening, I signed the acceptance of the lease and delivered the original acceptance to Sheikh Mubarak. An Arabic copy of the acceptance, with translation, has been forwarded to the Foreign Secretary and an Arabic copy has been retained by me in my personal * Forwarded herewith. custody and a copy * will be forwarded to you by next S. G. Knox. mail. A translation accompanies this letter. 5 . I trust that the papers will be found in order except for the unfortunate addition, which I shall endeavour to account for in the following paragraph. The somewhat curious wording of the condition in clause 3 of the lease and acceptance, introduced in accordance with the direc tions contained in the Secretary of States’s telegram of date 2nd October, was due to Sheikh Mubarak who seemed a little doubtful as to whether he was not committing himself to the lease for an annual rent of Rs. 60,000 of all the lands, mentioned anywhere in the agreement. If it has any special effect, it would seem to mean that, even should the British Government determine the lease, they would still retain their right to take the other lands on lease, in pre ference to other applicants. 6 . At my first interview with Sheikh Mubarak on the morning of the 11th October, the full effect of the telegraphic comments on the Warba proposal had unaccountably escaped me, and I mentioned the concession as one of the additions to the agreement which His Majesty s Government wished inserted. The proposal was favourably received. On my return, I at once detected my error and found myself in the unpleasant dilemma of showing vacillation which might arouse suspicion or of doing more than I had been ordered to do. After giving the matter much anxious consideration, I decided that the latter was the preferable course and, in drafting, left the Warba concession rather vague, I trust that, as apparently the concession does not bind Government in this particular direction in any way, the oversight may be pardoned, while, at the same time, I venture to express my profound regret for the carelessness which gave rise to it. 7. Sheikh Mubarak, during one of my interviews with him, showed some anxiety about payment, and indeed, for one moment, I thought that he was going to insist on the first payment before he signed the agreement. I asked him how he would like it paid, and he expressed the wish that it should be paid in Bombay to his Agent Mohamed-us-Salim-us-Sadera'vi, feitaram Building (H) Block, Bombay. I do not know if this man is a well known Bombay merchant, but he could be traced immediately by application to Messrs. McKinnon MeKcmie &amp; Co., Agents for the British India Company at Bombay. It would, I venture io think, be an advantage, if he could be paid the first year’s rent with as little delay and formality as possible, and I would request that I may be favoured with information by telegraph of the payment that I may communicate the news to Sheikh Mubarak. 8 . In conclusion, I have the honour to commend to your favourable notice the services of my Arab Moolla, Abdulla bin Abdul Hahi, who has been of the greatest assistance to me in preparing the drafts of the lease and acceptance. The negotiations have now been proceeding for some months, and I have not heard the least whisper from outside of the negotiations which goes far to show that he has been absolutely faithful to the trust reposed in him. \\ ith 642 F. D.the necessity for continued secrecy, it might be inconvenient to recommend him for a title or a medal. I would, therefore, recommend that an English letter acknowledging his services might be addressed to him by yourself, accompanied, if possible, by the sanction of one month’s extra pay. I could meet this expenditure from Secret Service funds at my disposal. Could the letter and sanction reach me before the Id Ramthan, the gift on that day or on His Gracious Majesty’s birthday would be especially graceful. I would see to it that there was no publicity. Postcript to letter No. 551, dated the 16th October 1907, from Major S. G. Knox, LA., Political Agent, Koweit, to Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., I.A., Resident and His Britannic Majesty'* Consul-General in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. It may be useful to place on record that, when the agreements were exchanged, the Accept' ance of the lease signed by me was read over by the Sheikh’s Secretary, Abdul Aziz bin Salim bin Badar, to Sheikh Jabir bin Mubarak, who before affixing his seal in witness to his father’s seal, verbally approved the agreement, and asked if the agreement to which his seal was being affixed, i.e., the lease, corresponded with the one that had been read over to him. He was informed that it did, mutatis mutandis. The Sheikh turned to his son and said that everything that suited the British Government suited him. To this Jabir agreed, only adding, rather ungraciously at such a moment, “ pro vided that they do not do anything to injure Koweit interests.” He followed this up however with “ But we shall certainly not allow anyone else to interfere.” [ Secret and Confidential.] Translation of lease of the Shweikh lands.

Eleventhly. —And, further, Sheikh Mobarak-us-Subah, ruler of Koweit, on behalf of himself, and on behalf of his heirs after him, promises that the rate, levied on goods imported or exported by the subjects of the aforesaid English Government to or from Koweit territories, shall not exceed the rate levied on goods imported or exported by his subjects—I mean the people of Koweit—to and from Koweit territories. Twelfthly. —It is further clearly understood that Sheikh Mobarak-us-Subah, ruler of Koweit, has accepted this rent especially from the precious Imperial English Government and that, as for others than it, Sheikh Mobarak-us-Subah would not accept from among all the Powers though they should give him more than this rent, Sheikh Mobarak-us-Subah would not allow them to possess authority in his dominions and, as for the precious Imperial English Govern ment, he is grateful to them and their generosity is upon him and that he will not consent that a Power, other than them, shall interfere, though they gave him more than this rent, and he hopes for the permanence of the care of the precious Imperial English Government and its kindness on him and on his heirs after him, and the precious Imperial English Government has honoured me with the special permission that I may assure Sheikh Mobarak-us-Subah, ruler of Koweit, on behalf of the precious Imperial English Government that the aforesaid English Government does not wish to interfere in the affairs of Koweit except for the profit of the people of Koweit and the increase of trade and knowledge and friendship between the English Government and the people of Koweit and, as regards Sheikh Mobarak-us-Subah and his heirs after him, the desire of the precious Imperial English Government is that the friendship and agreement between the English Government and the Sheikh of Koweit may be perpetual. And finally, Sheikh Mobarak-us-Subah, at the express wish of the precious Imperial Eng lish Government, promises that this agreement shall be kept absolutely secret until such time as the precious Imperial English Government gives permission for its disclosure. And I Major S. G. Knox, Political Agent of the precious Imperial English Government in Koweit, on behalf of the precious Imperial English Government, have accepted each and all^ r &lt; of the terms set forth in this agreement, and, therefore, I have affixed my signature this day o Ramthan, 1325 H, corresponding to the fifteenth day of October 1907 A.D., and to what I say God is the best witness and protector.

I may state that the information was all volunteer ed and that, after letting my visitor have his say out, I tried to change the subject.

A Conference of Representatives of the India Office, Admiralty, and Foreign Office will meet next week to examine and report on question of possible terminal ports for Bagdad Railway. Oovernment of India lay great stress on the importance of rendering more effective our support in staving off Turkish aggressions on Sheikh of Koweit’s Fao properties and on Bubiyan, since, next to Koweit, Khor Abdulla is only possible harbour in that region, and affords facilities for wharves. Questions of territorial jurisdiction will have to be considered by the Conference, and it is desirable that they should be furnished with any further observations you may have to make in regard to Sheikh’s claims to Warba Island, Fao, Um Kasr, and Bubiyan. Negotiations regarding acquisition of site at Bunder Shweikh are in advanced stage, but it is also of great importance that we should secure prior rights to all suitable sites for a terminus.

Purchase of land near Koweit. I presume that you desire my observations mainly on the political aspect of the question, as seen from the Turkish side. If w r e acquire construction of the Bagdad-Bussorah section of railway we need not consider Koweit, and while inclined to think that probably Bussorah will eventually be terminus, it may happen otherwise. I do not consider that Sheikh of Koweit has show: satisfactory claim to territorial jurisdiction to any of the places you mention excej t Bubiyan island, and even this is meagre, though we have put it forward officially.* Clearly the Sheikh has only private rights at Fao. I am certainly in favour of acquisition of site for quays, &amp;c., at Koweit or anything that quietly crystallizes our interests there. * Mr. Wratislaw, His Majesty’s late Consul at Bussorah, expressed a diametrically opposite view in regard to the Sheikh’s claim to Bubiyan, which he considered to be good. [904] B. We must assume, however, that any fresh encroachment on Ottoman territory will not only he greatly resented but possibly drive Sultan to seek assistance from another Power, even if by so doing he has to make concessions in same neighbourhood to that Power. If we wish to follow lines of least resistance we should let wily Sheikh watch his opportunity to extend his territorial jurisdiction to Urn Kasr and other neighbouring districts of most importance from the point of view of Bagdad Railway. This involves his protection, but we have already given Porte to understand that we could not view with indifference an attack on Koweit, It does not, however, meet difficulty as regards immediate future.

I am also to inclose a copy of a letter which has been addressed by this Depart ment to the Admiralty, and to say that Mr. Morley wiil be prepared to depute a representative to the proposed Conference between the Foreign and India Offices and the Admiralty.

IN amplification of this Office telegram dated the 23 rd August, 1907 , I have the honour to forward herewith, for the information of the Government of India, a copy of the letter received from the Political Agent, Koweit, on the subject of the lease of the foreshore of Bunder Shweikh and its environs. Inclosure 2 in No. 3 . Major Knox to Mr. Bill. (Confidential.) Koweit, August 21 , 1907 . I HAVE the honour to forward herewith, in duplicate, copies, with translations, ot the proposed draft Agreement by Sheikh Mubarak to lease to the British Government the land to the south of Bunder Shweikh and of the draft Agreement by myself accepting the conditions on behalf of the British Government. 2 . It is unfortunate that Sheikh Mubarak should hesitate to sign the Agreement in question without receiving a duly authorized acceptance in form from myself, but to press the point too firmly would only excite greater suspicion and might imperil the success of the negotiations. 3 . 1 have been solemnly assured by Sheikh Mubarak that he will affix his signature, witnessed by his son, Sheikh Jabir, to the document, as soon as I am ready to give him a document duly signed by myself accepting the conditions to which he has agreed. 4 . It will be impossible for him to plead ignorance ot the Agreement, as it has been prepared finally by his own confidential secretary, and in the preliminary stages wasread over letter by letter and discussed most carefully between ua. The Arabic draft remains, or course, in my personal custody. I trust that the notes appended by me to the translation, together with the quasi-telegraphic despatch sent by me in haste to you last mail, will show fully the course the negotiations have taken. J?’ ^ rc f ard the form of the accepting Agreement, 1 venture to hope that it vili be allowed to stand in the maiu, though verbal alterations here and there can be inserted, as Sheikh Mubarak has not yet been told what form this letter will take, ft vuiuld, I think, allay a gcod deal of suspicion if I am authorized, on the part of (xovernment, to gi\e some assurance that it is not the wish of Government to interfere in Koweit except tor the laudable, harmless motives mentioned in the accepting Agreement, and that the Government wishes to see the Sheikh of Koweit powerful, independent, and beholden to nobody. 6. I shall make one more effort to obtain in writing from Sheikh Mubarak the assurance made verbally and detailed in paragraph 3 above. If, however, I fail, I would recommend that I may be authorized to accept in the form indicated, and I would urge that it is extremely important that there should be as little delay as oossible in what I venture to hope may be the final stage of the negotiations. 7. A more formal acceptance, signed either by the Resident or higher authority, as the wisdom of Government may direct, might lollow in due course, if it should be considered advisable. 8. I think I may safely say that, while Sheikh Mubarak hesitates to commit himself, he and his son, Sheikh Jabir, are both delighted at the course events have taken, less, I believe, on account of the actual profit to them over the deal than because they take it to be an indication of a strong policy for the future, and an assurance that the railway from Bagdad to the sea will be in the hands of the English and that the terminus will be at Bunder Shweikh. 9. I am forced, at the moment of closing the mails, to reopen this letter, as the Sheikh’s letter in which he admitted in writing to me that the draft Agreement met with his approval introduced conditions foreign to the actual lease, and especially a dangerously ambiguous clause relating to customs. I promptly visited the Sheikh, but found that he would not consent to treating the customs as a separate matter, and his especial fear was that, as soon as we had got the Shweikh lands into our hands, we should say to him: “ Yes, you can take customs dues in your town, and we will take them within our limits.” I assured him that Government had no intention whatever of taking customs dues, and pointed out to him that the clause, as it stood, would allow him or his successors, in a moment of displeasure, to enhance customs dues to such an extent as to kill trade and render our Concession nugatory. 10. We then agreed to submit to the wisdom of Government the following general principle to be enunciated in the Agreement accepting Sheikh Mubarak’s offer to lease, viz., that Government, on their part, agree not to collect customs dues within the boundaries of Koweit, and that Sheikh Mubarak, on his part, binds himself to furnish a customs schedule with a percentage rate based on present-day rates, as taken from his own subjects, to be applicable to all British subjects or British Indian subjects or other subjects of His Gracious Majesty the King-Emperor, and that the rates are not to be increased without the consent of both parties. 1J. I am fully conscious of the inconvenience of introducing a customs regula tion into the middle of a lease, but to have insisted on its exclusion would have roused Sheikh Mubarak’s suspicions to such an extent as would have imperilled the whole course of the negotiations. Of itself, it would appear to me that the fixing of a regular customs rate on British and British Indian subjects is a distinct advantage, for, although the customs rate is higher than it used to be in Koweit, it compares favourably with the old Ottoman rate of 8 per cent, or the Persian rates, and is, on the whole, favourable, and it will be extremely useful that it should not be altered except with our consent. 12. Sheikh Mubarak also implied that he required the letter of acceptance from Government, by which he means a letter signed by myself duly empowered in that behalf, should also follow' closely and in detail the Agreement to lease, signed by himself. There appears to be no objection to this course. 13. I am compelled, therefore, with much misgiving and regret, to suggest that I should be empowered to do the best I can in the circumstances and to give to Sheikh Mubarak a letter which should follow closely, mutatis mutandis, (1) the Agreement to lease; (2) the form suggested in paragraph 5 above ; and (3) the general principle, enunciated in paragraph 10 above and in Sheikh Mubarak’s letter, of which I have the honour to inclose herewith a copy and translation in duplicate.4 r t ■ J Inclosure 3 in No. 3.

After asking after your dear heart, afterwards, with reference to the paper which comprehends the detailed boundaries in the lands of Shweikh and the lease as mentioned in the paper which l gave to Major Knox and of which a copy is with me, I am accepting everything that is mentioned therein.

(Seal of Sheikh Mubarak.) True translation: • (Signed) S. G. Knox, Major, Political Agent. Inclosure 4 in No. 3. Translation of the Draft Agreement, not vet signed, showing progress of the negotiations. IN the name of God, the Exalted. This Agreement is from me, Sheikh Mubarak-us-Subah, Ruler of Koweit, on behalf of myself and on behalf of my heirs, to Major Knox, Political Agent of the precious Imperial English Government at Koweit, on behalf of the English Government. The reason of writing this paper is that I, Sheikh Mubarak-us-Subah, Ruler of Koweit, have leased in perpetuity to the English Government the land, of which the boundaries are detailed below, south of Bunder Shweikh. First .—The boundary of the land on the north-west shall be 7,500 cubits in length in a straight line, and situated in it the coal-house which I, Sheikh Mubarak, have constructed in these days in the aforesaid land, and the straight line shall march, as far as possible, corresponding with the sea line ; but, apart from these two conditions, it shall be lawful to the English Government to draw this direct north-western boundary at their choice and pleasure. And, secondly, the eastern side and the western side shall be each 600 cubits long, and the southern side shall be'7,500 cubits long, and the whole land shall be rectangular; and of this land there shall be to me, Sheikh Mubarak, of it a plot, on the north-western side of which shall be the coal-house aforesaid, the four sides of which shall be each 300 cubits long, the total 1,200 cubits long (apart from the dimensions of the coal- house) ( T ), and opposite the house—I mean the coal-house—to the north-west shall belong to me, Sheikh Mubarak. Secondly .—The rent of the land aforesaid^ shall be counted at 4 rupees per cubit yearly, which shall flow from the day that this paper, duly agreed, signed, and sealed,shall come into the hands of the two parties, and the rent shall be paid yearly in advance. Thirdly, —In explanation of the preceding paragraph, the aforesaid lands are embraced by one line the length of which is 16,200 cubits. (Deducting from it the line of 1,200 cubits, apart from the measurements of the house) ( 3 ), the remainder is 15,000 cubits, and the rent of the land according to this line amounts to 60,000 rupees, which will be paid to me, Sheikh Mubarak, or to my heirs, in advance yearly, as long as the British Government desires the aforesaid land. Fourthly. —There is included in the aforesaid rent, without other rent or demand of any kind, the right to all land above ground or under sea, between the two sides, the east and the west, produced in the north-west direction to 3 fathoms of sea water at the time of the lowest low tide (opposite the north-western boundary) ( 3 ). and it is lawful for the English Government to build and construct between the aforesaid limits any building of any kind, coal-sheds, harbour works, &amp;c. And also it is lawful for the aforesaid Government to put down buoys and do all work needful for the ease of the ships from the open sea to the Bunder. And also it is lawful for the English Government that they should lease the lands in part or in whole for a fixed term of years or in perpetuity to the English subjects or to the subjects of “British India,” I mean the people of India, or to the subjects of me, Sheikh Mubarak, I mean the people of Koweit, at their perfect will ai d pleasure. Fifthly. —And further, in consideration of the rent detailed, I, Sheikh Mubarak, confirm, on my own behalf and on behalf of my heirs, my former promise that neither I nor my heirs will grant, sell, or lease to a foreign Government—and in this is included the Ottoman Government—or to the subjects of any foreign Government, any of our land within Koweit boundaries or around it without the permission of the precious English Government. Sixthly. —And also I, Sheikh Mubarak, and my heirs, am bound in this paper that we will give to the English Government the right of pre-emption in sale or lease of the lands detailed below:— 1. The lands which lie adjacent to the lands detailed at a distance of 2,000 cubits in any direction from the nearest boundary of the leased lands, but to my subjects, the people of Koweit, to them shall be a right of pre-emption stronger and prior to that of the English Government in this special land. 2. The entire Island of Shweikh ( 4 ) and its surrounding foreshore. 3. All the lands and the foreshore in the direction of Ras Kathama to a distance of 2 sea miles, I mean 8,000 cubits in any direction from Ras Kathama ; if the Government should have any desire in that place, I mean Kathama, then it will be on lease separate from the lands of Shweikh, at a rent ( 5 ) that shall please me, and there shall be to me a house near the house of the Government, should the Government desire (the land), and the house which shall be to me shall be a square, each side 300 cubits, the total 1,200 cubits ; and to my subjects also land (which is not opposed to [adjoins] the desire of Government) ( 6 ), and if it should be necessary I will leave to the Government a road to the sea within my limits, the breadth of which shall not be less than 10 cubits. Seventhly. — In explanation of the preceding paragraph, that it may not be concealed, whenever any soever may come and desire to buy or to take on lease the lands detailed in the sixth paragraph, either in part or the wEole, every time before that I, Sheikh Mubarak, or my heirs, accept the offer of the buyer or of the lessee ( 7 ), it behoves and is incumbent on me, Sheikh Mubarak, or my heirs, that we should inform the Agent of the English Government in Koweit, or the Consul-General of the precious English Government in Bushire, and we will give to the aforesaid friend a perfect opportunity, not less than three months, that he may consult higher authority and decide whether the English Government wishes to buy or take on lease the aforesaid lands or no. Eighthly .—If the opinion of the English Government is fixed on the purchase or lease of the lands sought for [demanded] in accordance with the offer and conditions of the purchaser or lessee, the offer of the English Government will be accepted without talk or further demand ( 5 ), and the demanded lands will be sold or leased to the aforesaid English Government on these conditions ( 8 ), and I, Sheikh Mubarak, have accepted this rent especially from the precious Imperial English Government, and as for others than it, 1 would not accept from among all the Powers, though they give me more than this rent, I will not allow them to possess authority in my dominions, and as for the precious English Government, I am grateful to it and its generosity is upon me [and as long as I experience their kindness, and after me my sons, then I am as I have mentioned in this [904] Cand I will not consent that a Government other than them of the Goverri- ments shall interfere, though they will give me more than this rent, and I hope, please God, that this graciousness to me from the precious Imperial English Government will endure to me and to my heirs after me, and (1 hope for) the permanence of their care and kindness. Notes by Political Agent. ( J ) /.e., we are not to deduct the dimensions of the coal-house, say, 100 cubits in circumference, and give the Sheikh 1,100 cubits. It is to be a clear 1,200 cubits (north west side 300 cubits), in which the coal-house is to be placed somewhere, preferably at Sheikh Mubarak’s option. ( 2 ) Coal-house and compound. ( 3 ) The object of the insertion of these words is to show that our boundary follows the 3-fathom line, and is not a direct line drawn between the 3-fathom points at the extremities of the east and west sides produced. A sketch showing the waving 3-fathom line was given by me to Sheikh Mubarak in the course of these negotiations. ( 4 ) There are existing fishing rights here granted by a previous Sheikh to a section of the “ ’Awazim.” ( 5 ) The ambiguity here will be noticed between the two 5’s, but the meaning is fairly clear. Sheikh Mubarak will not sell, but only lease his rights in Kathama. This destroys value of the ready acceptance of an offer of sale, but, to avoid suspicion and discussion, I was compelled to let it stand. ( 6 ) Part of another of Sheikh Mubarak’s interpolations. It seems harmless, but obscure. A better Arabic scholar than myself may understand exactly what is meant, but I do not understand how 7 land can “ adjoin ” or “not oppose” a desire, nor exactly what is meant by the “ desire of the British Government.” The explanation given to me is “ any lan i that the British Government do not want.” (') Would-be lessee. Arabic word means “wishing to hire.” Viz., conditions on which the would-be buyer or lessee was willinsr to take the land. The words in italics and between brackets seemed to me impossible to accept, as they would make the lease a lease on sufferance. These words were twice inserted by Sheikh Mubarak, but in the afternoon of the 19th August he eventually consented to their omission. In the same afternoon he told me that he objected to the signing of the Agreement, but that he would inclose the draft copied out fairly by his own secretary, with a covering letter in which he would say that he approved the draft and would exchange it for a letter of acceptance signed by me as soon as I was fully authoiized to accept. Ihere seemed to be no reasonable objection to this course, so I agreed. The draft, duly copied out, with the objectionable words omitted, was handed by the Sheikh’s Secretary Abdul Aziz-bin-Salim-bin-Badar to my Moolla Abdulla, who brought it to me on the morning of the 20th August. There was, however, no covering letter, and I am endeavouring to obtain one. . ^ slight addition was made to sixthly (2), cc only the fishing-nets are to me, Sheikh Mubarak.” These fish-nets or weirs are, from their nature, confined to the broad shallow fiats to the east, north, and north-west of the island. Should it be used for a quarantine station, it would be necessary to buy out the fishermen, which would probably be done cheaply enough. Otherwise, from the point of view of harbour works, the fishing-nets do not obstruct, and might well be let alone. Inclosure 5 in No. 3.

Inclosure 6 in No. 3. Dra ft of proposed Telegram to the Government of India. (Secret.) YOUR telegram of the 27th August and two telegrams of the 8th September: Koweit. Treasury having agreed to bear a moiety (2,000/.) of annual rent, Agreement with Sheikh for lease rectangular plot at Bunder Shweikh for yearly rent of 60,000 rupees may be at once concluded, as in clauses 1 to 5 of draft inclosed in Knox’s letter dated the 21st August. Proposal to acquire further sites is being more fully investigated herein communica tion with Foreign Office and Admiralty, and questions of territorial jurisdiction—for example, in the case of Warba Island—appear to be involved. For clause 6 of the Agreement a clause should therefore, if possible, be substituted, reserving to His Majesty’s Government the right of pre-emption or priority of lease in regard to any further sites which are or may be within the jurisdiction of the Sheikh of Koweit. Here also the reservation of enclaves may be admitted if inevitable. Your views as to customs, slaves, and independence are approved by His Majesty’s Government. The passage in the last lines of Knox’s draft acceptance of Agreement should be abbreviated so as to read “the desire ot the Government is that the friendship and agreement between the Government and the Sheikhs of Koweit may be perpetual.” Inclosure 7 in No. 3.

I am directed to inquire if the Lords Commissioners concur in this suggestion, and, if so, whether they will be so good as to nominate a representative.

Grey, a copy of a letter from the Government of India dated the oth September, 1907, as to the measures which should he taken in consequence of the conduct of the Sheikh of Koweit in taking part in an expedition organized by the Sheikh of Moham- merah against his rebellious tribesmen. Mr. Morley would be glad to learn the views of Sir E. Grey regarding the alterna tive proposals made in paragraphs o and 6 of this letter. He is, however, disposed to think that it would be better to avoid taking any immediate action to give effect to either of them, having regard to the negotiations for the purchase of land at Koweit find the expediency of proceeding slowly in the gradual establishment ot our position and relations with the Sheikh. I am, &amp;c. (Signed) COLIN G. CAMPBELL. - i J. Inclosure 1 in No. 4. Government of India to Mr. Morley. (Secret.) Si r&gt; Simla, September 5 , 1907 . WE have the honour to forward herewith copies of correspondence regarding the conduct of the Sheikh of Koweit in taking part in an expedition organized by the Sheikh of Mohammerah against his rebellious tribesmen. 2. It appears that Sheikh Khazal of Mohammerah found himself obliged to take strong measures, in his capacity as Persian Governor of the Mohammerah district, in order to compel the tribesmen of the Beni Truf to pay their revenue. Sheikh Mubarak, about the middle of June, proceeded to Mohammerah in his steam-yacht for the purpose of supporting his friend. He took with him a large quantity of small arms and ammu nition, water-skins, and other articles which he handed over to Sheikh Khazal, and he subsequently sent his vessel back for a second consignment. He also arranged, at Sheikh Khazal’s request, to garrison the Mohammerah outpost of Kasbeh temporarily with some of his own men, so as to free the Arab garrison for service with the field force. The operations resulted in the surrender of the Beni Truf. Although the operations in which Sheikh Khazal was engaged are described merely as the reduction to order of a rebellious tribe the Beni Truf, we have reason to believe from a note by Colonel Burton, when acting as Consul at Mohammerah in 1904, that the Sheikh has contemplated the reduction of this tribe for some time, with the object of extendingn S ; estl0 ' ed terrlt ? r \ a authonty to Hawizeh,* on the Turkish frontier ; so that the form nnrf f 1 P r 7 mor ®.

The Persian Government might reasonably imagine that the prompt assistance rendered by Mubarak to Sheikh Khazal would encourage the latter to assert his independence, should he find a convenient oppor- tunity for doing so, while the Porte might regard the incident as an indication of Mubarak s growing disregard of Turkish suzerainty, and he might even have been arrested as a pirate tor plying in Turkish waters with an armed vessel. We understands that the Minister at Tehran has received intimation that the Russians suspect the Rntish authorities of having organized an alliance between the Sheikhs of Mohammerah and Koweit with a view to the independence of the former, and it is also reported^ from Monammerah that the Persian Government is suspicious of the friendship between the two Sheikhs. Your attention is invited in this connection to the despatch of the 19th Juh, 1906, from Sir C. Spring-Rice to Sir E. Grey, which we have received since the preceding remarks were written. 4- The possibility of a coalition between these Sheikhs who occupy the territory dominating the head of the Gulf had not escaped our attention, and in connection with this incident we venture to invite a reference to the apprehensions which we expressed in our telegram dated the 8th October. 1906,§ to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, as to the possible formation of a confederacy of Arab Sheikhs led by Sheikh Mubarak and the Sheikh of Mohammerah in order to secure their independence of foreign dominion, the attitude assumed by Sheikh Mubarak appears to favour the supposition that he is at all events desirous of drawing closer the bonds between himself and Sheikh Khazal, even to the extent of furnishing armed assistance to the latter in Persian territory, so that the matter will have to be closely watched in future. 5. As you are aware, the Agreement || concluded with the Sheikh of Koweit on the “3rd January, 1899, contains no stipulation as to the conduct of the Sheikh’s external relations by the British Government, but merely provides that the Sheikh shall not, without the previous sanction of the British Government, receive the Representative of any foreign Power at Koweit, or give for occupation or any other purpose anj portion of his territory to the Government or subjects of any other Power. For so long as these stipulations are observed the good offices of the British Government were promised under the Agreement to the Sheikh. This formal Agreement has, however, since been modified by the messages conveyed to the Sheikh in compliance with Lord George Hamilton’s telegram of the 27th September, 1901, in connection with the differences between the Sheikh of Koweit and the Amir of Nejd, and the Honourable St. John Brodrick’s telegram of the 3rd February, 1904, when a conflict was feared between the Sheikh, in combination with Sadun Pasha, and certain Arab tribes under Turkish protection. On both these occasions the Sheikh of Koweit was informed that His Majesty’s Government would use their good offices on his behalf only if he refrained from aggression and was guided by their advice; and His Majesty’s Government recently contemplated^ con veying a similar message to the Sheikh, in order to prevent him from making reprisals on the Ajman tribe. It may, in consequence, be held to be the settled policy of the British Government that the external relations of Koweit should be in their hands. But we consider that our position in Koweit vis-a-vis other Powers would be greatly strengthened if this principle of policy could now be embodied in a formal Agreement; and advantage might perhaps he taken of Sheikh Khazal’s recent warlike expedition in Mohammerah and of the negotiations now in progress for the purchase of the Koweit foreshore to add the requisite clause to the Agreement to be executed, in which Sheikh Mubarak is apparently anxious to repeat his pledges as to the exclusion of all foreign interests in Koweit other than the British. It might be necessary, in order to secure the Sheikh’s consent to this addition, to increase, by way of a subsidy, the annual * From the Gulf to Hawizeh the mediating Commissioners in 1850 laid down a line of frontier. f Vide Inclosure 4.

Our Political Agent may also be able to utilize this recent adventure of Sheikh Mubarak as a lever to induce him to give us the reservations required on reasonable terms. We now have the honour to request your sanction to the foregoing proposal; and, if it commends itself to His Majesty’s Government, we would ask that your views may be communicated to us by telegraph, since the Sheikh has stated that his offer regarding the foreshore will only remain open for two months with effect, as we understand, from the 14t!i August; and it would be convenient that the negotiations regarding the proposed addition to the Agreement should be conducted simultaneously with those regarding the foreshore. 6. If His Majesty’s Government do not approve of this proposal we consider that the Sheikh should be informed that the Government of India take strong exception to the share taken by him in the recent expedition in Arabistan, and that, unless he seeks and is guided by our advice in such matters, we shall not be able to exercise our good offices on his behalf.

Bushire, July 28, 1907. I HA\ E the honour to forward, for the information of the Government of India, a copy of a communication which I have received from the Political Agent at Kuweit on the subject of Sheikh Mubarak’s recent visit to Mohammerah. 2. On receipt, before I left Bushire, of the demi-official communication mentioned in paragraph 3 thereof, I let Major Knox know informally that I did not propose to take any action until I had received further and parallel illumination on the subject from His Majesty’s Consul at Mohammerah. L p to the time I left for Shiraz on the 26th June Mr. McDouall’s reports did not give me the impression that any deterrent action on my part was either necessary or useful, nor indeed was any possible, as I was not in any case in a position to com municate quickly or satisfactorily with Sheikh Mubarak in time for my advice to be of use. Major Knox’s letter now inclosed arrived after I had left Bushire and followed me to Shiraz, where, on arrival, I ascertained by telegraph from Bushire that the Sheikh ot Mohammerah’s opera;ions had terminated, that he had effectively brought the Beni J rut to heel, and that Mie.u&gt;J~i Mubarak had returned to Koweit. I rider these circumstances we can afford to examine the several aspects of the incident with deliberation. 3. Stated briefly the position was as follows:— Sheikh Khazal, in his official capacity of Governor, on behalf of the Persian Govern ment, ot the Mohammerah district and' appanages, having for a long time past had difficulties with the Beni Truf, owing to non-payment of revenue by them, ultimately found himself obliged to take the field against them. Sheikh Mubarak, learning that his fast triend was having an anxious time, and also prompted no doubt by the consideration that were Sheikh Khazal defeated his own security for large sums of money lent to him would be greatly prejudiced, proceeded to Mohammerah in his steam-yacht to support his ally with his presence and counsels. He took wuth him at the same time (and sent his vessel back tor a second consignment) a large quantity of small arms and ammunition, water-skins, and other articles likely to prove useful to his ally. He also arranged at Sheikh KhazaTs request to place some of his own men * Vide our telegram dated August 28, 1907. -TVtemporarily to garrison the Mohammerah outpost of Khasbeh, opposite Mohammerah, in order to free its present Arab garrison for service with Sbeikb Khazafs field force. 4. Looking at the picture from the most favourable point of view, we see Sheikh Mubarak rendering prompt and yeoman service to his friend the Persian Governor of Mohammerah, with a result greatly to the benefit of the Persian Administration and of law and older in Arabistan, as well as to the enhancement of the prestige of their Representative. If the Persian Government take exception to Sheikh Khazal receiving help from Sheikh Mubarak, it is presumably open to them to display such signs of their displeasure to Sheikh Khazal as will deter him from accepting such assistance again. Or, if they feel so inclined, which is unlikely, they might move us to use our influence with Mubarak to discourage such action on his part in future. The unfavourable aspects of the incident are that Sheikh Mubarak used his steam- yacht to convey arms and ammunition up the Shatt-el-Arab, a course which is open to exception from an international point of view, and which may possibly imbue the Persian Government with the apprehension that he might at any time take the same measures to assist the Sheikh of Mohammerah in asserting his independence. His action may even give foreign Governments a handle for the charge that we are directly encouraging the two Sheikhs in this direction. In fact this charge has already been made by the Russian Legation, as will be seen from the two telegrams cited, which passed after I left Bushire. 5. Regarding the matter from the standpoint of the Political Agent at Koweit, I quite understand Major Knox feeling hurt at Sheikh Mubarak’s neglect to consult him or to give him his confidence. On the other hand, putting myself in Sheikh Mubarak’s shoes, I cannot ignore the fact that any help which was to be given to Sheikh Khazal must be given promptly if at all, and that he has sufficient experience of our deliberate methods to know well enough that by the time he could receive a reply to any reference made to us the crisis would long since have passed, and .Sheikh Khazal would have been defeated or would have won without his help. On the whole, and unless the position becomes modified by further diplomatic action on the part of Persia, Turkey, or Russia (to which we seem to have a fairly practical answer), I cannot think that Sheikh Mubarak’s escapade, if it be one, calls for the drastic notice advocated by Major Knox, namely— (1.) A sharp remonstrance accompanied by force; or (2.) The withdrawal of our Representative from Koweit. I am rather inclined to consider that the case will be met by my informing Sheikh Mubarak, on behalf of Government, if necessary, that we quite sympathize with him in his desire to prove a friend in need to his ally Sheikh Khazal, but feel called upon to make it plain to him that by conveying arms and ammunition up the Shatt-el-Arab in his private yacht without the authority or permission of the Persian Government he ran great risk of placing himself in serious difficulties with that Government or the Porte, from which we should have found great difficulty in assisting him to extricate himself. I have not got with me the text of our Secret Agreement with Sheikh Mubarak, but if his action could be quoted as being inconsistent with that part of the document dealing with his relations with foreign Powers so much the better. 6. While expressing these views, I quite realize that it would be possible to regard this interesting incident in quite a different fight from that in which it presents itself to me; and I can do no more than commit the circumstances to the wiser and more detached examination of Government. I have not forwarded a copy of this communication to His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran. Inclosure 3 in No. 4. Major Knox to Major Cox. Koweit, June 22, 1907. I HAVE the honour to inform you of further details with reference to the return of Sheikh Mubarak’s steam-launch to this port on Wednesday last. The vessel arrived about noon of the 19th with only Ali-bin-Khalifa and Suliman-bin-Hamud aboard of her. 2. The interval between noon and sunset was busily employed in loading her up with small arms and ammunition. This was all carried on, without the smallest attemptleast 2,000 rifles and at concealment, in broad daylight, and it is estimated that at proportionate quantity of ammunition were put on board of her. ., , 3. I have already reported demi-officially that 1,500 rifles are said to have gone with her on her first voyage. I have also reported that Sheikh Jabir-bm-Mo alia of the Nasser of Gasbah left for up-river. I only learnt the next morning that he left in Sheikh Mubarak’s launch. . . . „ i 4. The reason for these extraordinary proceedings is variously reported, and and probably erroneously as to detail, though fairly correct in the mam. 5. The two undisputed assertions are— (a.) That Sheikh Mubarak has lent Sheikh Khazal a very large sum of money on this year’s date crop; „ - ai, -i (b.) That Sheikh Mubarak wants to make sure of repayment, as Sheikh Hhazal s affairs are in a bad way. 6. One report goes that Sheikh Khazal is dead and that there is trouble about the inheritance, and that Sheikh Mubarak wishes to secure the heir who he thinks will look after h^mterests-i ^ ^ Khazal&gt;s tribes have ris e n against him, and Mubarak is sending him assistance. „ T u- i,* 7 Those who support the first rumour state that the reason for Jabir-bin-Mo alia s return is that Sheikh Mubarak proposes to instal him again as Sheikh ot Gasbah and will support him in that position provided be secures Mubarak m the enjoyment ot this year’s date crop. 8. Whichever version is correct, the facts seem enough to warrant very serious apprehension. Sheikh Mubarak is openly using a large vessel (his private property) to import large quantities of arms into either Persian or Turkish territory, and it appears to me that the authorities of either country might try and effect his arrest on this account alone and we should have nothing to say in his defence. Indeed, one rumour of his capture by the Turkish authorities at Bussorah has already reached me, though 1 am inclined to treat it as a wild flight of the imagination. _ 9. Compared with this escapade, the interference in the affairs of Central Arabia would appear mere child’s play. . 10. With much hesitation in dealing with matters of such grave import, 1 venture to suggest that only two courses are open to us— (a.) To administer a sharp remonstrance to Sheikh Mubarak, supporting it with such a show 7 of force as will make it evident to him that w T e are his masters as well as protectors and mean to be so, and insist on the scrupulous fulfilment, so far as is now possible, of all the various promises that he has made and broken. An important point would be the deportation of three or four of the principal importers of arms. It does not seem to me that there would be any serious local opposition, even if the inhabitants were capable of such opposition, for Sheikh Mubarak’s rule is unpopular, and the Koweit people say openly that all the money he has sent to Sheikh Khazal has been wrung out of them by new and unheard-of taxes. I fully believe that the Sheikh realizes that the Turks will never forgive him, and that the Germans have so throwm in their lot in with the Turks that they cannot deal with him sincerely if they would. His only hope is in our support, which has made him what he now is—the richest and most powerful Sheikh that Koweit has ever seen. He would, in my opinion, submit to whatever terms we chose to compel him to, if he were once convinced that w r e were in earnest. (6.) If it is decided that such drastic action is impossible in present circumstances, it would be well to withdraw 7 our Representative, for Sheikh Mubarak’s high-handed actions are bound to involve us in serious trouble before long, and he listens to no remonstrances.

There is nothing unusual in the punitive expedition of the Sheikh ot Mohammerah against the Beni Truf, as it is a frequent occurrence for this tribe to be in revolt. The accusation made by the Russians is of course entirely without foundation. [32284] No. 5. India Office to Foreign Office.—(Received September 27.) Sir, India Office, September 26, 1907.

I AM directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to acknowledge the receipt of your letters of the 25th and 26th instant, inclosing the draft Agreement and copies of a draft telegram to and of a telegram from the Viceroy respecting the proposed lease of a portion of the foreshore at Bunder Shweikh, near Koweit. With regard to the draft Agreement, I am to state, for the information of Mr. Secretary Morley, that, in the opinion of Sir E. Grey, it would be desirable to state explicitly that His Majesty’s Government reserve the option to determine the lease at any time. This appears to be provided for by clause 3 of the draft Agreement; but if, without endangering the success of the negotiations, it could be made more explicit, such a precaution might prove expedient. [904] Ef H ” j [ 14 Sir E Grey considers that the wording of clause 5, which would practically seem to conHrm the Agreement of 1899, is particularly well chosen, and the sentence which runs “any of our land within Koweit boundaries or around it” appears to be so comprehensive as to render unnecessary the substitution of a fresh clause m place of clause 6, as suggested in the draft telegram to the Viceroy which forms the mclosure in your letter of the 25th September. , . . Sir E. Grey is, however, strongly of opinion that the words printed m italics in clause 8 should be omitted, as they might be construed in such a manner as to enable the Sheikh to elude his engagement not to sell or cede land without the consent or His Majesty’s Government. . n , I am to add that Sir E. Grey concurs m the proposed alteration m Captain Knox s draft note of acceptance, and in the suggestion of the Government of India that a proviso should be added to the Sheikh’s proposals regarding customs, to the effect that he will agree to treat British subjects always on the same footing as Koweitis. It seems desirable that absolute secrecy should be maintained as to the Agreement, and that Sheikh Mubarak should pledge himself to this course, while the Political Agent at Koweit should take no steps for the present to mark out the ground. In view of the assent of the Treasury to allow haif the cost of the lease to be borne by Imperial funds, and to the payment of a sum of 1,666/. 13s. 4c/. towards the purchase of a launch for Captain Knox, I am to suggest that, it the above observations meet with the concurrence of Mr. Morley, the Government ot India should be authorized forthwith to conclude the Agreement with the Sheikh of Koweit on the basis proposed.

Report of the Inter-Departmental Conference on the Bagdad Railway Terminus to Sir Edward Grey. Sir, Foreign Office, October 2, 1907. WE have carefully considered, in accordance with your instructions, the various ports on the Persian Gulf, not in Persian territory, which would be suitable for the terminus of the Bagdad Kailway. They are three in number, namely, Bunder Shweikh (near Koweit), Warba Roads, including Um Kasr, and Bussorah. We are unanimously of opinion that, from topographical and hydrographical considerations, Bunder Shweikh, which occupies a position south-west of Koweit, would undoubtedly be the best site, since—(a.) A wharf about 1 mile in length, or a series of smaller wharves of that length, could be constructed, with depths of not less than 25 feet alongside at low water. . ^ v 4' judicious arrangement of beacons would enable a vessel to use a channel to this wharf of a depth of not less than 14 feet of water at low-water springs, of 21 feet at high-water neaps, and 24 feet at high-water springs. (c.) It would not be difficult to increase the depth of this channel to 20 feet at low-water springs, or 27 feet at high-water neaps, and 30 feet at high-water springs, and it is possible that even greater depth could be obtained at some cost. (d.) The berths alongside the wharf would be perfectly secure at all times, and would be open to the breeze, which would prevent the stifling heat so prevalent at times on the littoral of the Persian Gulf. (e.) A i ail way could be constructed to run down to the wharf, and passengers or goods be embarked or disembarked without delay. The above advantages are important, as the whole tendency of traffic in the present clay is to bring vessels to wharves or into floating docks, with railway com munication alongside, so that transhipment to small vessels, lighters, or boats is avoided. The question of the expense of fitting a terminal port for traffic is small in comparison with the expense of a railway, and the advantage of a railway is greatly reduced if a convenient terminal port cannot be constructed. Such a convenient terminal port could be made at Bunder Shweikh at probably very much less cost than at any other place. Warba Roads, including JJm Kasr. Next in order of convenience, Warba Roadstead has most advantages; but, owing to the longer distance from the open sea and to the necessity of buoying and lighting the channel, the facilities are not so great as at Bunder Shweikh. Moreover, the Island of Warba and the adjacent coast near Um Kasr is for a large portion of the year practically uninhabited. In these circumstances, it would be difficult to insure protection against Arab raids—a danger which would not exist at Koweit, where the conditions for defence against land attacks are more favourable. Um Kasr, a small creek on the Khor Zobeir, might possibly be made useful as a terminus, either in itself or in conjunction with Warba Roads. It is somewhat more inaccessible than Warba Roads, and the facilities for constructing a wharf are limited, since at most the accommodation would only suffice for berthing three vessels at a time, as against .six at Bunder Shweikh. Buss or ah. We consider that, despite its commercial importance, the promoters of the railway will not adopt Bussorah as a terminus, except in the last resort, because the cost of maintaining a sufficient depth to enable ocean-going steamers to cross the bar of the Shatt-el-Arab (which is 10 miles in length) at all times of tide, would undoubtedly be considerable. It would be possible to avoid this difficulty by cutting a ship canal from the vicinity of Bussorah to the Khor Zobeir (a continuation of the Khor Um Kasr and the Khor Abdulla); but the time occupied in navigating the canal, and then the channel to the open sea, would be a drawback, in so far as passenger traffic and the carriage of mails are concerned. Two other places have been suggested as possible terminal ports, namely, Fao and Ras Kathama, at the head of Koweit Bay. Fao. Except for greater proximity to the sea, Eao, which lies inside the bar of the Shatt-el-Arab, has all the disadvantages and none of the commercial advantages of Bussorah. Fas Kathama. The depth of 20 feet at low water is about J mile or upwards from the shore. It would therefore he necessary to run out a pier at considerable expense. The construction of wharves would be much more costly than at Bunder Shweikh.Under these circumstances we strongly recommend that the strip of foreshore at Bunder Shweikh should be acquired as proposed, since (a) it would undoubtedly be an asset in negotiations for British participation in the railway; and (6) even if these negotiations were to prove abortive, it would he expedient to consolidate our position at Koweit, in order to counterbalance the prejudicial effects of any (jerman port which may possibly be constructed in the neighbourhood at some futui e time. But, while we hold that the leasing of land at Bunder Shweikh is a step in the right direction, we do not consider that the possession of this harbour alone by Great Britain would exclude the Germans from access to the lersian Gulf, it would no doubt render our co-operation in the railw r ay more desirable, but it would not make it indispensable. . 1 -rr- The position of this country v r ould indeed be incalculably stronger if His Majesty’s Government were to secure rights of pre-emption or piioiity of lease in regard to Warba Island and Bubivan Island, since both command the approaches to°the Khor Abdulla and Khor Urn Kasr, as also the commodious anchorage on the south of Warba Island. We entirely concur in the view expressed by the Govern ment of India in their letter of the 4th February, 1904, namely, that “ With the shores of the mainland and of Bubiyan Island in the possession of a single Power, the anchorages below Um Kasr and at Warba Island can at any time be converted into an impregnable harbour, and even if the day is still distant when the banks of the Khor Abdulla are likely to be armed with foreign forte or batteries, the undivided occupation by a German Railway Company of a potentially invulnerable position is not calculated to conduce to the enhancement either of British commercial prosperity or of British political prestige.’ We therefore recommend, if diplomatic considerations permit, that the Sheikh of Koweit should be invited to specify the nature of his claims to Warba Island, to which he is understood frequently to have referred; and that the continued occupation of Bubiyan Island by a Turkish post, in derogation of the Sheikh s territorial claims (which have been recognized and supported by His Majesty s Government), should be neutralized by the establishment forthwith of a Kow r eiti post, with the countenance of His Majesty’s Government, on Warba Island, or, if that should prove undesirable, on the northern shore of Bubiyan Island. If practicable, we would even recommend the establishment of posts on both islands. We desire to emphasize the importance which we attach to the effective assertion of the Sheikh’s territorial claims to Bubiyan. We wish to record our conviction that, once the railway has been constructed, the economic penetration under German influence will be so formidable as in the course of time seriously to undermine our position—political, commercial, and strategic—in the Persian Gulf. The recent institution of a line of subsidized steam ships plying between Hamburg and the Gulf already marks the interest of Germany in those regions. We would therefore venture to express the conclusion that every elfort should be made to insure a fair measure of British control over the terminus of the Bagdad Railway. We do not, however, feel confident that we possess the means .absolutely to debar Germany from acquiring an outlet on the Gulf; and this outlet, though at' first commercial, might eventually be transformed into a strategic base, but by steps so gradual and clandestine as to render protests difficult or impracticable. In these circumstances we cannot but express the opinion that it is in the highest degree desirable to come to terms with the promoters of the Railway. Finally, we would advocate that all steps which His Majesty’s Government may consider feasible should be taken to consolidate the advantages we already possess at the entrance to the Persian Gulf, notably at Musandim Peninsula (where the harbour accommodation and water supply are adequate) and at the Islands of Kishm and Henjam.

Condition in clause 3 as to payment of 60,000 rupees a year only as long as Rritish Government desires the land is, however, so important that words should be added to that clause, if this is possible without endangering success of the negotiations, to the effect that His Majesty’s Government reserve the option to determine lease at any time, and that the money would cease to be paid in the event of such option being exercised. Proposal to acquire sites other than at Bunder Shweikh is being more fully investi gated here in communication with Foreign Office and Admiralty, and questions of territorial jurisdiction, e.g., in case of Warba Island, appear to be involved. Foreign Office consider that wording in clause 5, viz., “ any of our land within Koweit boundaries or around it,” is useful, and should be retained, but that the words printed in italics in clause 8 should certainly be omitted. I understand from your telegram 27th August that this has already been arranged, and with this omission clauses 6, 7, and 8 are accepted.

India Office to Foreign Office.—{Received October 14.) Sir, India Office, October 12, 1907. I AM directed by Mr. Secretary Morley to inclose, for the consideration of Secretary Sir E. Grey, a copy of a letter from the Government of India in the Foreign Department, dated the 12th September, 1907, on the subject of two acts of organized piracy committed by Arabs residing at Dayir, on the Persian coast. In the one case the crew of a Persian boat, consisting of six persons, were all murdered, with the exception of one boy, who escaped. In the other, the murdered persons were the crew and passengers of a Koweiti boom numbering twenty-nine in all. The Government of India recommend that a strong representation should be made to the Persian Government with a view to securing the capture and punishment of the offenders and full pecuniary reparation for the sufferers in the Koweit case, and they further suggest that the Persian Government should be informed that, failing compliance with the demands of His Majesty’s Government within a stated time, suitable naval action will be taken at Dayir. It is possible that such action might involve the entering ot Persian territorial waters and the landing of men upon the Persian coast. It seems clear that effective action is required to prevent the repetition in the Persian Gull of such acts as those which have taken place, and Mr. Morley would be glad to learn the views of Sir Edward Grey as to the suitability of the proposals of the Govern ment of India. The suggestion of the Sheikh of Koweit that he should employ an armed dhow for the protection of his vessels is doubtless inadmissible. I am, &amp;c. (Signed) COLIN G. CAMPBELL.

Th of the nir»c\' h ' ei \incstioned by Captain Bowman, denied all knowledg dav wb^n^he tr o m informat lo u subsequently received it appears that on the ver day when the Sphinx called at Dayir the Chief of the pirates was in Dayir and wastaying with the Khan of that place. On the 16th June, 1907, His Majesty’s Minister ! n ^ ie Resident that he could hold out no hopes that useful action would be taken bj the I ersian Government in the matter at present. . ^ ^ rue in the first place the victims were Persian subjects, and that it might be supposed that the Persian Government would themselves take steps to secure redress for their own subjects from the pirates residing within their jurisdiction. The ntish Government have, however, acknowledged a general obligation for the preservation o t e maritime peace of the Gulf, and it is their object to secure the suppression of piracy in Gulf waters. It would therefore, in our opinion, be our duty, even if British interests or the interests of British-protected persons were not primarily concerned, to take all possible action with a view to scattering the Dayir gang. And in the case of the second offence we consider that we are under a special obligation in this instance, because some subjects of the Sheikh of Koweit to whom we are bound, under the Agieement of the 23rd January, 1899, to extend our good offices have been robbed and murdered by the pirates. 5. We would accordingly venture to recommend that a strong representation should be made to the Persian Government with a view to secure the capture and punishment of the offenders and full pecuniary reparation for the sufferers in the Koweit case. In view of the offence committed against their own subjects, the Persian Govern- ment should presumably be only too ready to co-operate with us against the offenders. But as it appears certain that no representations to the Persian authorities, whether made locally or at Tehran, are likely either to secure satisfaction for the offences which have been committed or to prevent a recurrence of such crimes in the future, we would suggest that the Persian Government should be informed that, failing compliance with the demands of His Majesty’s Government within a stated time, suitable naval action will be taken at Dayir. 6. If our proposal is approved, it is quite possible that, in order to clear out the pirates, it may be necessary for the naval authorities not only to enter Persian territorial w aters, but also to land men on the Persian coast. We are aware that the Persian Govern ment in 1903, with reference to an encounter between certain pirates, wdio had organized a surprise attack on Koweit, and the sailors of His Majesty’s ship “Lapwing’’ protested against the adoption of this course, but the Minister at Tehran was on that occasion directed by His Majesty’s Government to inform the Persian Government that the Commanders of His Majesty’s ships, whilst they would always be careful to respect the sovereign rights of Persia, and to co-operate to the utmost of their ability with the local authorities, must, in the absence of any effective Persian naval force, retain their freedom to take at their discretion and on their responsibility, even within Persian territory, such measures for the repression of piracy as the urgency or gravity of any particular case might seem to them to warrant. The Persian Government were reminded that the security from pirates enjoyed by the population both on the Persian and opposite Arab coasts was entirely due to the past efforts of the British navy, and they were informed that the British Government had entered into special compacts on this subject with the Trucial Chiefs, and that they could not engage to give any new orders to the Commanders of British vessels which would tend to restrict the efficiency of their action in maintaining the maritime peace in the Gulf. It was also pointed out that the Persian Government’s demand was hardly consistent with the fact that in 1397, with the object of suppressing the traffic in arms, they had given permission for His Majesty’s steam-ships to search merchant-vessels in Persian waters, and to confiscate any arms and ammunition intended for Persian ports which might be found on board. 7. In March 1904 the claim of the British Government to take measures even on Persian territory for the suppression of piracy was once more enforced, when Sir N\ O’Conor reported to the Marquess of Lansdowne that a serious case of piracy on the Shatt-el-Arab had been perpetrated on a British Indian sailing-vessel laden with dates. He stated that His Majesty’s Consul at Bussorah had reason to believe that the stolen property was hidden in the pirates’ huts at Abkatch, on the Khor Hindian Persian coast of the Shatt-el-Arab, and suggested that the “ Lapwing,” then at Koweit, should be instructed to search the place. Instructions were issued to the Commander of His Majesty’s ship “ Lapwing,” and a search was accordingly made in Persian territory, but without success. 8. In view of these precedents, His Majesty’s Government would doubtless not be disposed to consider any protest that the Persian Government might make regarding action taken by us against the pirates, and naval action in an outlying part of Persian territory on the Gulf, with the active assistance or consent of the Persian authorities, ought not unduly to excite the susceptibilities of other Powers. [901] GV 22 9 . The most cogent reason in favour of immediate action in the present case is to be found in the fact that the Sheikh of Koweit has asked, with reference to the piracy committed on his subjects, that the Government of India will concur in his employing a heavily-armed dhow to protect his vessels plying between Koweit or Bussorah and Persian ports. We consider that this proposal should be negatived, since, if the Sheikh, with our consent andassistar.ee, dispatched an armed dhow to parade the Gulf, the Turks might regard it as a symptom of his growing independence, and they might complain of a disturbance of the status quo. Again, the Persian Government might consider the move to be a sinister one, especially having regard to the fact that Mubarak has recently rendered armed assistance to the Sheikh of Mohammerah. Finally, the policing of the Persian Gulf by Mubarak would amount to an infringement of our prerogative, and therefore, in accordance with established policy, could not be allowed. Hut it is evident that if we were to forbid the Sheikh to take steps for the protection of his subjects, and were at the same time to take no effective steps ourselves, we should inevitably arouse his resentment. On the other hand, if we succeeded in securing reparation for the attack on Mubarak’s subjects, this fact would afford an important demonstration of our will and power to protect his interests. We should thus, while confirming the Sheikh’s allegiance to us, conclusively establish our claim to protect his subjects, whether in Persia or elsewhere. We trust, therefore, that the adoption of the measures proposed in paragraph 5 of this letter may be authorized. We have, &amp;e. (Signed) MINTO. KITCHENER, H. ERLE RICHARDS. E. N BAKER. C. H.

Ling ah. December 6, 1906 .—The Residency Agent, Lingah, has received a letter from Sheikh Abdullah-bin-Muhammad Bushri, Chief of Taona, informing him of an act of piracy committed about the middle of November last on a Shivoh boat by some Arabs temporarily residing either at Dayir, Rangoon, or Um-el-Kurm, but said to have been expelled from their homes by Sheikh Khazal of Mohammerah. The boat was attacked while she was between Keis Island and Taona, and the pirates severely wounded and threw overboard her crew, numbering six, took all the cargo, valued at 6,000 rupees, and left after scuttling the vessel. The incident came to light through one of the wounded crew who was carried ashore near Taona. The Derya Begi’s attention has been directed to the matter. Inclosure 3 in No. 14 .

In defiance of pressure from His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, and myself here, no serious action has been taken by Persian authorities, and the Pars and Bushire Governments continue to shift responsibility for maintenance of order in Dashti district from one to the other. Meanwhile another case of piracy with wholesale murder has just come to light, perpe trated some time ago on a Koweit dhow and alleged on good grounds to have been committed by the same gang. In this connection Sheikh of Koweit writes urging thatthe authorities of Dashti should be called upon to hand the pirates over to justice, their habitat and identity being, he declares, notorious.

Sheikh Mubarak further asks that the Government of India will concur in his employing a heavily armed dhow to protect his dhows plying between Bussorah or Koweit and Persian ports, and that no objections may be raised to his dealing direct with piracies, if any are encountered. Such a vessel must, to he of any use, operate, if necessary, in territorial waters and creeks, and in any case I think that it would be difficult to prevent it from doing so. But, apart from this, the Government of India will probably consider that the same objections exist as were held to exist with regard to a similar application which emanated from the Sheikh of Bahrein. If, however, we oppose Mubarak’s proposal, we should obviously insist on the Persian Government taking adequate measures to suppress the gang and see that such measures are satis factorily carried out. I doubt the ability of the present Governor to take effective measures, and at present he does not admit that he has the jurisdiction to do so. If, however, he receives peremptory orders and the means to carry them out, I will endeavour to keep him up to the mark. Repeated to Sir C. Spring-Rice. Inclosure 5 in No. 14 .

WE informed you that the boom of Ali-bin-Fathala, of our subjects the people of Koweit, five months ago loaded up from Bussorah date baskets and passengers of the people of Koweit, both male and female, and left for Koweit. The aforesaid boom was lost. It was conjectured that she had been wrecked by the winter gales. After sixty days news came that the boom had grounded on the Island of Amair, and her mast and yards still standing, and they saw in her blood, and we sent the owner of the boom to the aforesaid boom, and he also saw in her much blood, and vve did not know what had happened to them. After that, Nakhoda Abdulla, of the people of Kharj, informed us that, from the talk of the people of Dayir to him in Bahrein, the children of Hamaidi had taken away the boom, when at anchor at the buoy, and had killed all the people in her, and had taken all her property and the cargo in the boom and had abandoned her, so that she grounded at the Island of Amair. And the sons of Hamaidi are notorious; they are all dwelling in Dayir, and a source of profit to the Ruler of that place. We have sent Haji Abdulla, of Kharj, to you, and he has informed you verbally. We hope that you will acquaint the Resident of this occurrence. And the sons of Hamaidi are pirates, well known and banished by Sheikh Khazal and the Bussorah Government. It is incumbent on the Ruler of Dayir that he should seize these men and hand them over to the British Government. There will be loss to our subjects from such killing and plunder. Also, if the Government grant me permis sion, 1 will send a boom, and in her sufficient strength to protect our boats which go to Bussorah and the ports of Paris. Then, if they see ihe aforesaid pirates, they will fight them. Without the orders of Government we can do nothing, and our subjects are in the protection of Government, and such a loss has befallen them, and we are sure that the pity of Government will not permit this, for our subjects are in the protection of Government.

TXT . _ Bushire, June 23, 1907. 1JN amplification of my telegram dated the 16th June, 1907, I have the honour to submit, for the information of the Government of India, precis of the two cases of piracy referred to. . „ duplicates are being forwarded to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran for information. Precis of a Case of Piracy with Murder committed on a Persian Dhow off Taonah in November 1906, and subsequent correspondence. _ A native vessel of the “ mashoweh ” type belonging to the Persian port of Shivoh, wuci had been m the “ poos ” of dry-dock ot Lingah for some days, was ready for sea on the 16th November. She had on board six persons and cargo to the value of 6,000 rupees. • In the dry-dock alongside of her bad been another “ mashoweh ” manned by some Arabs. It seems that these Arabs are well known as “ bilashtis ” (pirates), and are saidto belong to a party of bad characters which was expelled from the Shatt-el-Arab two yeais ago by the Sheikb of Mohammerah on account of depredations committed there. 1 j Fe T a X 10US ^ state( ^ to h ave been living for some time past at Dayir, Kangoon, an m-el-Kuim, on the Dashti Coast. Their identity was probably not recognized at Lingah until after the occurrence. This Arab “mashoweh” got under way from Lingah on the night of the 16th September at the same time as the Shivoh craft, and it appears that on the night before the 1st Shawwal (i.e., night of the 17th November) a the Arabs appicached the Persian dhow on the pretence of asking for water, and, having boarded hei, attacked and stabbed to death, as they thought, the six occupants, and transferred all the merchandize found in her to their own vessel. They then tied the wounded 01 murdered men to the anchor rope and threw them overboard with the anchor and boied a hole in the dhow, so that she got waterlogged and partially sank. The piiutes then left, and it is not known where they went to. Of the six men thrown over board, one, a boy of 16, who was not dead, got free from the ropes and was cast ashore between Charak and Taonab about noon on the 1st Shawwal (18th !7ovember), w T here he was found by some persons ot Taonah and taken to the Chief of that place, Sheikh Abdullah-bin-Mahomed Bushri. He was nursed at Taonah until he was sufficiently recovered to be taken to Lingah to have his wounds tended. On the same afternoon that the boy was found an object was seen in the sea by the Taonah people, and boats proceeding to the spot found that it was the scuttled dhow with several holes in her. , The above was reported by the Residency Agent at Lingah on the 29th iSovember, 1906. Later reports from the same source, obtained from one Abdul Rahim-bin-Mullah Abdullah, an inhabitant of Kangoon, have brought the following details to light:— The occupants of the Shivoh dhow were as follows :— 1. Ibrahim. 2. Ali-bin-Ibrahim, son of above and sole survivor. 3. Mahomed-bin-Abdul Ghani, owner of the looted merchandize. A merchant of Gaobandi, for the Chief of which district he was also bringing some gold ornaments. 4 and 5. Names not known. Two of the crew. 6. One ship’s boy; taken prisoner by the pirates and murdered later. The pirates, after sinking the dhow, made for a small port 2 miles east of Kangoon called Nakhl-i-Ghanem, where they murdered the ship’s boy (No. 6) above referred to and landed the captured goods. From here they transported the latter by land to Kangoon. Ahmed Khan, uncle of Jamal Khan, of Dashti, the Deputy Governor of this place, appears to have been away at the time, but two of his relatives, who were acting for him, by name Mullah Hussein and Zayer Mirza, are alleged to have received a portion of the booty, a share being also given to Haji Khan-bin-Jamal Khan, Deputy Governor of Dayir, who had come to know of the proceedings. Jamal Khan, the Governor of Dashti, on hearing of the incident, evidently appeared to have feared pursuit, as he gave directions for the pirates to be disguised as men of Dashti and taken to the village of Bordaghoon, 30 miles north of Dayir, where they were to await his arrival. The families of the pirates reside at Kangoon, and their dhow, after landing the stolen goods, appears to have been taken to the Khor-i- Bardistan, 2 miles east of Dayir. As regards the pirates themselves, they appear to have been three in number, all brothers, though there is some divergence of opinion regarding their precise names. 1. According to Abdul Rahim-bin-Mulla Abdulla, originally an inhabitant of Kangoon, but now residing at Lingah, they were— (1.) Sheikh Abdulla. (2.) Sheikh Ibrahim. (3.) Sheikh Abdul Reza. 2. According to the Abyssinian slave of one Mohamed-bin-Subah, who knew them while at Lingah, their names were— (1.) Abdulla; (2.) Meloo; (3.) Abdul Reza; and they were known as the family of Hamaidi and residents of Manyoohi. [904]26 3. When Captain Bowman, of His Majesty’s ship “ Sphinx,” went to Dayir and Rangoon to make inquiries at the request of the Resident in January 1907,* the local authorities denied all knowledge of this particular piracy, but declared that it was true that about four years ago some Bussorah Arabs had plundered a dhow belonging to Seyyid Saleh, of Mohammerah, and had then come to Dayir to sell the cargo, but that on the Sheikh of Mohammerah sending warning to Dayir about them their dhow and cargo had been seized and the Arabs expelled. Their names were said to be— (1.) Abdullah Rutha-bin-Hamaid. (2.) Ibrahim-bin-Hamaid. (3.j Ismail-bin-Hamaid-al-Amah (now a prisoner at Mohammerah). It was further stated that after being expelled from Dayir they had sought refuge at Abu Tbabi or Shargah. In connection with this visit of His Majesty’s ship “ Sphinx,” Mr. Francis, retired Assistant Surgeon, one day stated, in conversation to a member cf the Residency, that he was at Dayir the day the “ Sphinx ” called there, and that c&lt; the pirate ” was actually staying with the Khan of that place at the time ; that this fact was well known to every one, but that as he (Mr. Francis) was treating the Khan, he could not go out and give information on board. Further corroboration from an independent source is furnished in a report from the Political Agent, Koweit, before whom one Muhammad-bin-Haji Abdulla-bin-Muhammad, a nakhoda and inhabitant of the Island of Kharg, stated that the chief of the pirates was actually in “ Dayir at the time the ‘ Sphinx ’ called.” Action taken by the Residency. On receiving the first report (dated the 29th November, 1906) of the piracy from the Residency Agent at Lingah, inquiries w T ere made at once from the Derya Begi, the then Governor of the Gulf Ports, as to what steps he proposed to take in the matter. The Derya Begi replied (13th December, 1906) that Da)ii was in Dashti under Jamal Khan, and that Dashti was in the jurisdiction of Pars, and that therefore he was unable to see his way to taking any action. The Resident again communicated with him, pointing out that he did not see how anything could be done, except by sea by means of the “ Persepolis,” which w r as under his (the Governor’s) control, and inquired whether it would assist in any way if he (the Resident) were to move the Legation to get the “ Persepolis ” deputed. The Derya Begi informed the Resident in reply (3rd January, 1907) that the “ Persepolis ” had been damaged by the Customs officials to prevent him from paying a visit to Lingah, and that he could not make use of the “ Muzaffer ” without orders from Tehran, as she was under the control of the Customs Director. On receipt of this the Resident telegraphed (5th January, 1907) to the Minister, informing him of the position of affairs, and requesting that the Persian Government be moved to direct the Governor to proceed to Dashti in the “ Muzaffer.” At the same time (6th January, 1907) he requested the Senior Naval Officer (Captain Bowman), who happened to be at Bushire, to proceed to Dayir and make inquiries with a view to obtaining, if possible, further details regarding the piracy. On the 16th February the Minister replied to the Resident’s telegram informing him that it was stated by the Persian Government that the necessary orders had been sent. In the meantime, however, there had been a change of Governors. The Derya Begi, having left Bushire on the 30th January, was succeeded by Haji Saeed-es- Sultaneh, and the latter, having been offered the Governorship of Dashti by the Fars authorities, and having accepted the same (2Sth February), the Fars Government, to whom a reference was made on the subject by His Majesty’s Consul at Shiraz, repudiated jurisdiction and threw back responsibility on Bushire. The new Governor of the Gulf Ports, however, promised to take necessary action in the matter, though he at the same time denied having received any orders from Tehran in that connection. No action has up to date been taken by him, and the Resident now understands that the Saeed-es-Sultaneh has submitted his resignation of the Governorship of Dashti, though this has not yet been accepted. * It will be understood that His Majesty’s ship “ Sphinx ” only went to the locality to make inquiries for the Resident’s information.^ \ t 27 On the 16th June, 1907, in reply to Resident’s telegram of the 16th idem regarding TV/r* 0 • P ll ^. c J committed apparently by the same gang on a Koweit dhow, His Majesty’s Minister intimated that he could hold out no hopes that useful action would be taken by the -Persian Government at present. (Signed) P. Z. COX, Major, „ 7 . Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Bushire, June 23, 1907. Brief Details of a Piracy committed on a Koweit Dhow. ^ Roweit boom with a crew of four men, natives of Bussorah, and owned by Ah-bm-Hamad-ul-Fathala, originally of Bahrein, but domiciled (since forty years) in Koweit, left Koweit for Bussorah on the 24th December, 1906, leaving the latter place again on her return journey on the 4th January, 1907. She never returned, and was given up for lost. According to the father of the Xakhoda, who helped to load up the boat at Bussorah, there were about twenty-five native passengers on board, amongst whom were— 1. The daughter of Brahim-bin-Xugaimish, wife of Ali-bin-Xugaimish ; 2. Abdur Rahman-bin-Shahab ; both well known in Koweit. About the middle of March news was received that the boom had been seen derelict off the Island of Amair on the Arab coast near El Katif, but on inquiries being made there by the owner’s son Hussein, he was informed that it had been salved and taken by the inhabitants of the island to Bahrein for sale. Subsequently it transpired that the vessel had been recognized at Bahrein by friends of Ali-bin-Fathala, and inquiries were made which led to Sheikh Esa giving orders for the boat to be returned to the original owner, whose son had now arrived at Bahrein with a letter from Sheikh Mubarak. The Amair people declared that they had found in the boom many blood marks, a severed human arm, and the remains of a man with his hands tied behind his back, and towed by the boom. The vessel, when found, was said to have been absolutely empty, containing not a sail or a cubit’s length of rope. Its hull was, however, in perfectly seaworthy condition. Haji Abdullah-bin-Muhammad Arab, Xakhoda of Kharg Island, made a statement before the Political Agent, Koweit, on the 21st May to the effect that he had recently been sitting in a coffee-shop at Bahrein, when a Persian of Dayir, who was present and discussing these piracies, stated that the sons of Hamaidi, the notorious pirates, were well known in his village. They had recently been absent for two pr three months, and had then returned bringing dates and bracelets and gold-laced clothes of women. The chief of them was one by name Abdulla-bin-Hamaidi, of Bussorah, and his sons— 1. Abdur Reza. 2. Name unknown. Their crew consisted of— 1. Seyyid Mehdi of Ganawa (a well-known robber, once punished by the Headman of Bunder 11 ig). 2. Six men of Dayir. The man further stated that their head-quarters used to be Dayir, but that now they lurked in Khor Ziyarat, and had a house in Um-el-Kurran* and Jabrin Island. On the 6th June Sheikh Mubarak wrote pressing for the punishment of these men, and offering to arm a dhow for the purpose. His proposal is under reference to Government. (Signed) P. Z.

Foreign Office, October 29, 1907. ^ . irected by Secretary Sir E. Grey to acknowledge the receipt of your letter ot the 12th instant, in which you transmit a copy of a despatch from the Government of India on the subject of two acts of organized piracy committed by Arabs residing at Dayir, on the Persian coast, and involving, in one case, the murder of the crew and passengers of a Koweiti boom, numbering twenty-nine in all. I am to state, in reply, that Sir E. Grey concurs in the recommendation of the Government of India that strong representations should be made to the Persian Government with a view to securing the capture and punishment of the offenders and full pecuniary reparation for the sufferers in the Koweit case, and further that the Persian Government should be informed that, failing compliance with the demands of His Majesty’s Government, suitable naval action will be taken at Dayir. I am, however, to add that Sir E. Grey is not hopeful that the Persian Government will succeed, under present circumstances, in securing the punishment of the offenders, or indeed that they will easily be induced to pay compensation. He is accordingly of opinion that a vessel should be ordered to Dayir at once to watch the movements of the pirates in question, with the object if possible of effecting a capture at sea; and he further considers that the Commander should be authorized to land temporarily a sufficient force of men to capture the pirates and hand them over to the Persian authorities, if on arrival at Dayir he should hear that the pirates are in the neighbourhood. This action, as you are aware from the correspondence ending with Sir H. Walpole’s letter of the 11th March, 1903, would be in accordance with precedent and practice. On learning that these views meet with the concurrence of Mr. Secretary Morley, this Department would enter into the necessary communications with the Admiralty. I am further to state that Sir E. Grey agrees that the Sheikh of Koweit should not be allowed to equip an armed dhow. With regard to the incidental remark made in the final paragraph of the Govern ment of India’s despatch respecting the protection of Koweitis resident abroad, I am to inform you that, notwithstanding the subsequent correspondence on the subject. Sir E. Grey is disposed to adhere to the views expressed in Lord Lansdowne’s despatch to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople, No. 246 of the 2nd September, 1903, of which a copy is inclosed for facility of reference.

Your Excellency will find in the Confidential correspondence regarding Koweit, part 2, pp. 56, 57, an account of a similar question which arose in November 1900 in connection with the trial of a native of Koweit who was suspected of smuggling arms. [904] Ii : 30 His Majesty’s Consul-Greneral at Bushire was informed on that occasion that, as the district had never been placed under British prelection, His Majesty’s Government could not claim natives of Koweit as British-protected persons, nor would they be justiciable by British Consular Tribunals in Persia. The same argument would appear to he applicable to the present case, and your Excellency should instruct Mr. Monahan to be careful to abstain from giving any formal promise of British protection. At the same time, there seems to be no objection to his holding out a hope that his good offices would be exercised unofficially on behalf of these merchants in the event of their experiencing any unjust treatment at the hands of the Turkish authorities.

AS directed in Foreign Department telegram dated the 15th August, 1907, have the honour to submit herewith a copy of a letter dated .the 3rd September, 1907, to the address of the Political Besident in the Persian Gulf. 2.

I have, &amp;c. (Signed) S. G. KNOX. Inclosure 2 in No. 18. Major Knox to Major Cox. (Confidential.) Koweit, September 3, 1907. I HAVE the honour to report that Sheikh Mubarak informed me at an interview during the past week that M. Wonckhaus, the German merchant at Bussorah, had visited him at Failiya, in the Shatt-el-Arab. 2. He stated that he had merely come on an ordinary visit of courtesy, having heard much of Sheikh Mubarak-us-Subah, and being interested in him and his fine town. 3. He also said that he did not know if Sheikh Mubarak was aware of the friendly interest and solicitude with which His Imperial Majesty the Sultan watched Sheikh Mubarak and his doings, and how His Majesty was continually sending messages to the local Turkish authorities to safeguard Sheikh Mubarak’s interests in every way. To this the Sheikh appears to have made suitable acknowledgments. 4. Somehow or other, in spite of the courtesy visit, the talk insensibly drifted on to business matters. M. 'VVonckhaus began talking about his fine line of steamers, and expressed curiosity as to how and whence Koweit town drew its supplies. From Bombay, through the British India Company ? M. Wonckhaus was astonished to hear it; Bombay was so far away.n kkt &gt; (fork 31 5 . Sheikh Mubarak then expatiated on the long and close connection of Koweit town with the English. The friendship between the two was over 200 years old, and, in spite of the distance from Bombay, quite a number of Koweit merchants had business houses there, and all had intimate relations. If M. Wonckhaus were to ask Mr. Lyle, the British India Company’s Agent at Bussorah, he would learn that the British India Company looked upon the steamers visiting Koweit as Sheikh Mubarak’s private property They were at his beck and call. Extra steamers were sent up when required, and a steamer could be detained for a day or two if Sheikh Mubarak wished it. M. Wonckhaus here intimated that he and his Company would be found equally complaisant. 6 . Sheikh Mubarak also informed M. Wonckhaus that at a critical juncture in his affairs the British Government had interfered to protect him, had landed soldiers who threw up entrenchments, and owing to their kindness and firmness the danger had passed away. 7 . I venture to express the opinion that this intelligence, as communicated by Sheikh Mubarak, is not without significance in regard to my Confidential letter dated the 21 st August. It was intended to show that Sheikh Mubarak remains faithful to his engagements in spite of tempting offers to seduce him. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) S. G.

Foreign Office September 27th.1907 Sir Secret and Imr^diate. I am directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to acknow ledge the receipt of your letters of the 25th. and 26th instant, enclosing the draft agreement, and copies of a draft telegram to and of a telegram from the Viceroy respecting the proposed lease of a portion of the fore shore at Bunder Shweikh near Koweit. With regard to the draft agreement I am to state, for the information of Mr. Secretary Morley that, in the opinion of Sir E. Grey, it would be desirable to state explicitly that His Majesty's Government reserve the option to determine the lease at any time. This appears to be provided for by Clause 3 of the draft agreement; but if, without endangering the success of the negotiations it could be made more explicit such a precaution might prove expedient. Sir E. Grey considers that the wording of Clause 5 which The Under Secretary of state, -India Office.'© [\ which would practically seem to confirm the agreement of 1899, is particularly well chosen; and the sentence which runs 'any of our land within Koweit boundaries or around it' appears to he so comprehensive as to ren der unnecessary the substitution of a fresh clause in place of Clause 6, as suggested in the draft telegram to the Viceroy, which forms the enclosure in your let ter of September 25th. Sir E. Grey is, however, strongly of opinion that the words printed in italics in Clause 8 should be omit ted, as they might be construed in such a manner as to enable the Sheikh to elude his engagement not to sell or cede land without the consent of His Majesty’s Gov ernment . I am to add that Sir E. Grey concurs in the pro posed alteration in Captain Knox’s draft note of ac ceptance, and in the suggestion of the Government of India that a proviso should be added to the Sheikh’ s proposals regarding Customs, to the effect that he will agree to treat British subjects always on the same footing as Koweitis. It seems desirable that absolute secrecy should be maintainedmaintained as to the agreement, and that Sheikh Mu- harek should pledge hinself to this course; while the Political Agent at Koweit should take no steps for the present to mark out the ground. In view of the assent of the Treasury to allow half the cost of the lease to he home hy Imperial funds, and to the payment of a sum of One thousand six hundred and sixty-six Pounds thirteen shillings and fourpence towards the purchase of a launch for Captain Knox, I am to suggest that, if the above observations meet with the concurrence of Mr. Morley, the Government of India should he authorised forthwith to conclude the agreement with the Sheikh of Koweit on the basis proposed.

I think I may safely say that, while Sheikh Mubarak hesitates to com mit himself, he and his son, Sheikh Jabir, are both delighted at the course events have taken, less I believe on account of the actual profit to them over the deal, than because they take it to be an indication of a strong policy for the future and an assurance that the railway from Baghdad to the sea will be in the hands of the English and that the terminus will be at Bunder Shweikh. 9. 1 am forced, at the moment of closing the mails to reopen this letter, as the Sheikh’s letter, in which he admitted in writing to me that the draft agreement met with his approval, introduced conditions foreign to the actual lease and especially a dangerously ambiguous clause relating to Customs. I promptly visited the Sheikh, but found that he would not consent to treating the customs as a separate matter and his especial fear was that, as soon as we had got the Shweikh lands into our hands, we should say to him—“ Yes, you can take customs dues in your town and we will take them within our limits.” I assured him that Government had no intention whatever of taking customs dues and pointed out to him that the clause, as it stood, would allow him or his successors, in a mo ment of displeasure, to enhance customs dues to such an extent as to kill trade and render our concession nugatory. 10. We then agreed to submit to the wisdom of Government the following general principle to be enunciated in the agreement accepting Sheikh Mubarak’s offer to lease, viz., that Government, on their part, agree not to collect customs dues wdthin the boundaries of Koweit and that Sheikh Mubarak, on his part, binds himself to furnish a customs schedule with a percentage rate based on present day rates, as taken from his own subjects, to be applicable to all British subjects or British Indian subjects or other subjects of His Gracious Majesty, the King-Emperor, and that the rates are not to be increased without the con sent of both parties. I am fully conscious of the inconvenience of introducing a customs regulation into the middle of a lease, but to have insisted on its exclusion would have roused Sheikh Mubarak’s suspicions to such an extent as wmuld '' im- me , have perilled the whole course of the negotiations. Of itself, it would appear to that the fixing of a regular customs rate on British and British Indian subjects is a distinct advantage, for, although the customs rate is higher than it used to be in Koweit, it compares favourably with the old Ottoman rate of 8 per cent, or the Persian rates and is, on the whole, favourable, and it will be extremely useful that it should not be altered except with our consent. 12. Sheikh Mubarak also implied that he required the letter of acceptance from Government, by which he means a letter signed by myself duly empowered in that behalf, should also follow closely and in detail the agreement to lease, signed by himself. There appears to be no objection to this course. 13. lam compelled, therefore, with much misgiving and regret, to suggest that I should be empowered to do the best I can in the circumstances and to give to Sheikh Mubarak a letter which should follow closely, mutatis mutandis, (1) the agreement to lease, (2) the form suggested in paragraph 5 above, and (3) the general principle, enunciated in paragraph 10 above and in Sheikh Mubarak’s letter of which I have the honour to enclose herewith a copy and translation in duplicate. Translation of Sheikh Mubarak's letter, dated the 1 ith Rajah 1325 //., corres ponding to 2 1st August iqoj, in which he admits that the draft agreement leasing the Shweikh lands, has been approved by him subject to acceptance of the conditions by the British Government. From Mubarak-us-Subah, ruler of Koweit, to the presence of the high- placed Major Knox, Political Agent of the precious Imperial English Govern ment in Koweit (may he endure for ever). 1 M rAfter asking after your dear heart, afterwards, with reference to the paper which comprehends the detailed boundaries in the lands of Shweikh and the lease as mentioned in the paper which I gave to Major Knox and of which a copy is with me, 1 am accepting everything that is mentioned therein. Then, if the precious Imperial English Government approves in their exalted sight that (agreement), then I also ask for a paper, following that one in detail from the Government which shall remain in my hand and also it shall be detailed in the paper given by the Government that my town is to me and its boundaries like wise and all my arrangements remain in my hand in the matter of customs, etc., and all my arrangements at the present day to me and to my heirs after me*and, in the matter of the Shweikh lands and of the lands which the Government may, in the future, rent from me, the Government is to be bound in the paper that they will not take customs on anything in all the lands which they may rent or in which they dwell within the limits of Koweit. 1 As for the customs of Koweit, its arrangements are in my hands and to my heirs after me and there shall be an arrangement for the customs dues from the subjects of the Government. I mean, English merchants and people of India and other than them of the subjects of Government, by agreement between all— I mean me, Sheikh Mubarak and the Government—we will make a regulation of fees at some settled rate per centum and we will arrange them now according to my arrangements of the present day, on my subjects and, after it, there shall be no increase except by the consent of the two parties with the supervision of the Government and, for the explanation of my demands, I have sent this letter and the presentation of the circumstances to the Government is upon you and may you remain safe. Dated u Rajab 1325 H. = 2ist August 1907. Seal of SHEIKH MUBARAK.' (True translation) S. G. KNOX, Major, Political Agent. Translation of the draft agreement, not yet signed, showing progress of the negotiations. In the name of God, the Exalted. This agreement is from me, Sheikh Mubarak-us-Subah, ruler of Koweit, on behalf of myself and on behalf of my heirs to Major Knox, Political Agent of the precious Imperial English Government at Koweit, on behalf of the English Government. The reason of writing this paper is that I, Sheikh Mubarak-us-Subah, ruler of Koweit, have leased in perpetuity to the English Government the land of which the boundaries are detailed below south of Bunder Shweikh. First .—The boundary of the land on the north-west shall be 7,500 cubits in length in a straight line and situated in it the coal house which I, Sheikh Mubarak, have constructed in these days in the aforesaid land and the straight line shall march, as far as possible, corresponding with the sea line but, apart from these two conditions, it shall be lawful to the English Government to draw this direct north-western boundary at their choice and pleasure. And, secondly, the eastern side and the western side shall be each 600 cubits long and the southern side shall be 7,500 cubits long and the whole land shall be rectangular : and, of this land, there shall be to me, Sheikh Mubarak, of it a4 ou ^U)w / tt.(n^t' bb- *i plot on the north-western side of which shall be the coal house aforesaid the four sides of which shall be each 300 cubits long, the total 1,200 cubits’long (apart from the dimensions of the coal house) 1 and opposite the house, 1 mean the coal house, to the north-west shall belong to me, Sheikh Mubarak. Secondly. —The rent of the land aforesaid shall be counted at Rs. 4 per cubit yearly which shall flow from the day that this paper duly agreed, signed and sealed^ shall[come intojthe hands of the two parties and the rent’shall be paid yearly in advance. Thirdly, —In explanation of the preceding paragraph, the aforesaid lands are embraced by one line, the length of which is 16,200 cubits. ('Deducting from it the line of 1,200 cubits (apart fronjthe measurements of the house) 3 , the remainder is 15,000 cubits and the rent of the land according to this line amounts to Rs. 60,000 which will be paid to me, Sheikh Mubarak, or to my heirs in advance yearly, as long as the British Government desires the aforesaid land. Fourthly.— is included in the aforesaid rent, without other rent or demand of any kind, the right to all land, above ground or under sea, between the two sides, the east and the west, produced in the north-west direction to three fathoms of sea water at the time of the lowest low tide (opposite the north western boundary) 3 and it is lawful for the English Government to build and construct between the aforesaid limits any building of any kind, coal sheds harbour works, etcetera. And also it is lawful for the aforesaid Government to put down huoys and do all work needful for the ease of the ships from the open sea to the Bunder. And also it is lawful for the English Government that they should lease the lands in part or in whole for a fixed term of years or in perpetuity to the English subjects or to the subjects of “ British India,” I mean, the people of India, or to the subjects of me, Sheikh Mubarak, I mean, the people of Koweit at their perfect will and pleasure. Fifthly. And further, in consideration of the rent detailed, I, Sheikh Mubarak, confirm on my own behalf and on behalf of my heirs, my former promise that neither I nor my heirs will grant, sell or lease to a foreign Government and in this is included the Ottoman Government or to the subjects of any Foreign Gov ernment any of our land within Koweit boundaries or around it without the permission of the precious English Government. Sixthly. And also I, Sheikh Mubarak, and my heirs, am bound in this paper that we will give to the English Government the right of pre-emption in sale or lease of the lands detailed below :— Firstly The lands which lie adjacent to the lands detailed at a distance of 2,000 cubits in any direction from the nearest boundary of the leased lands but to my subjects, the people of Koweit, to them shall'be a right of pre-emption stronger and prior to that of the English Government in this special land. Secondly. I he entire island of Shweikh 4 and its surrounding foreshore. Thirdly. All the lands and the foreshore in the direction of Ras Kathama to a distance of two sea miles, I mean 8,000 cubits in any direction from Ras Kathama ; if the Government should have any desire in that place,mean Kath ama] then it will be on lease separate from the lands of Shweikh aTa rent 5 that shall please me and there shall be to me a house near the house of the Govern ment, should the Government desire (the land) and the house, which shall be to me, shall be a square, each side 300 cubits, the total 1,200 cubits ; and to my subjects also land (which -^ D0t ^ t0 the desire of Government) 6 and, if it ^ a ui w 11 1 a - - j ‘ ~ J ** A L should be necesary, I will leave to the Government a road to the sea, within my limits the breadth of which shall not be less than 10 cubits. Seventhly In explanation of the preceding paragraph, that it may not be concealed, whenever any soever may come and desire to buy or to take on lease the lands detailed in the^ 6th paragraph either in part or the whole, every time before that I, Sheikh Mubarak, or my heirs accept the offer of the f)5 I^tO y f' . buyer or of the lessee 6 7 it behoves, and is incumbent on, me, Sheikh Mubarak or by heirs that we should inform the Agent of the English Govern ment ,n Koweit or the Consul-General of the precious English Government in Bushire, and we will give to the aforesaid friend a perfect opportunity, not less i? an r 3 i, I r- 0rlthS ’ t ^ at may consu!t higher authority and decide whether the English Government wishes to buy or take on lease the aforesaid lands or no. or W^of'The tl iTT ni -'°^ h ?n English .l GQYern ”f nt L S fixed ° n the P urchase demanded m accordance with the offer and condi. ‘‘on 5 ° f , the P arch t aS f ° r lesse f- offer of the English Government will be accepted without talk or further demand = and the demanded lands will be sold or leased to the aforesaid English Government on these conditions * and I, Sheikh Mubarak, have accepted this rent particularly for the precious Imperial English Government and, as for others than it, I would not accept from among all the Powers though they give me more than this rent, I will not allow them to possess autnonty in my dominions and, as for the precious English Government, I grateful to it and its generosity is upon me (and, as lon% as I experience their kindness, and ajter me, my sons, then 1 am as I have men tioned in this paper) and I will not consent that a Government other than them of the Governments shall interfere, though they will give me more than this rent and I nope, please God, that this graciousness to me from the precious J? n P eria _ English Government will endure to me and to my heirs after me and (1 hope for) the permanence of their favourable notice and kindness. Notes by Political Agent. We are not to deduct the dimensions of the coal house, say 100 cubits in circumference, and give the Sheikh 1,100 cubits. It is to be a clear 1,200 cubits (north-west side 300 cubits) in which the coal house is to be placed somewhere, preferably at Sheikh Mubarak’s option. 2 Coal house and compound. 3 The object of the insertion of these words is to show that our boundary follows the three fathom line and is not a direct line drawn between the three fathom points at the extremities of the east and west sides produced- A sketch showing the waving 3-fathom line was given by me to Sheikh Mubarak in the course of these negotiations. 4 There are existing fishing rights here granted by a previous Sheikh to a section of the “ ’Awazim.” 5 The ambiguity here will'be noticed between the two 55 ., but the mean ing is fairly clear. Sheikh Mubarak will not sell but only lease his rights in Kathama. This destroys value of the ready acceptance of an offer of sale but, to avoid suspicion and discussion, I was compelled to let it stand. 6 Part of another of Sheikh Mubarak’s interpolations. It seems harmless but obscure. A better Arabic scholar than myself may understand exactly what is meant, but I do not understand how land can “ adjoin ” or “ not oppose ” a desire nor exactly what is meant by the “ desire of the British Government.” The explanation given to me is “ any land that the British Government don’t want.” 7 Would-be lessee. Arabic word means a wishing to hire.” conditions on which the would-be buyer or lessee was willing to take the land.i [ I / i The words in italics and between brackets seemed to me impossible to accept, as they would make the lease a lease on sufferance. These words were twice inserted by Sheikh Mubarak but, in the afternoon of the 19th August, he eventually consented to their omission. In the same afternoon, he told me that he objected to the signing of the agreement, but that he would enclose the draft copied out fairly by his own secretary with a covering letter in which he would say that he approved the draft and would exchange it for a letter of acceptance signed by me, as soon as I was fully authorised to accept. There seemed to be no reasonable objection to this course, so I agreed. The draft, duly copied out, with the objectionable words omitted was handed by the Sheikh’s Secretary Abdul Aziz bin Salim bin Badar, to my Moolla Abdulla who brought it to me on the morning of the 20th August. There was, however, no covering letter and I am endeavouring to obtain one. A slight addition was made to^ixthlyj secondly, “ only the fishing nets are to me, Sheikh Mubarak.” These fisnTiets or weirs are, from their nature, con fined to the broad shallow flats to the east, north and north-west of the island. Should it be used for a quarantine station, it would be necessary to buy out the fishermen which would probably be done cheaply enough. Other wise from the point of view of harbour works, the fishing nets do not obstruct and might well be let alone. j Translation of proposed draft acceptance of Sheikh Mubarak's agreement to lease Bunder Shweikh foreshore. u HjL f*' I 1&gt;U In the name of God, the Exalted. This agreement is from me, Major Knox, Political Agent of the precious Imperial English Government in Koweit on behalf of the precious Imperial English Government to Sheikh Mubarak-us-Subah, ruler of Koweit. And afterwards the reason of writing this paper is that I Major Knox, Political Agent of the precious Imperial English Governmenti£at Koweit on biehaffof the precious Imperial English Governmen^and by permission from it granted for this affair specially, there has come into my hands from Mubarak-us-Subah, ruler of Koweit, a lease of the lands to the south of Shweikh Bunder dated the day of 1325 H., corresponding to the day of in the year 1907, A.D,, and I, Major Knox, on the part of the precious Imperial English Government, have accepted all the conditions detailed in the aforesaid lease ; and, regarding what Sheikh Mubarak has written in the close of that lease that he hopes for thefjavourable notic^of the Government and its kindness on him and his heirs after him, the precious Imperial English Government has honoured me with the permission that I may inform Sheikh Mubarak, on behalf of the precious Imperial Government, that the Government does not wish to interfere in the affairs of Koweit except for the profit of its (Koweit) people and the increase of trade and knowledge and friendship between the English Government and the people of Koweit and, as regards Sheikh Mubarak-us-Subah and his heirs after him (the Government) does not desire to see in Koweit a ruler other than them ever and the perpetual desire of the Government is that it should not seethe Sheikh of Koweit other than strong, independent and not beholden to any one whatever and that the friendship and agreement between the Government and the Sheikhs of Koweit may be perpetual.No. 1841, doted Busfcire.the 25th August (received 2nd September) ,907.

India, a copy of the letter marginally noted, eu u- . r.u 1 r , e received from the Political Agent, Koweit on the subject of the lease of the foreshore of Bunder Shweikh and its environs No. 457, dated Koweit, the 21st August 1907 (Confidential). From Major S. G. Knox, I.A., Political Agent, Koweit, T ° —J ' ' F ' r , St . Assis f ant 10 the Resident and His Britannic majesty s Consul-Genetal m the Persian Gulf (in charge currentduties). 1 have the honour to forward herewith, in duplicate, copies, with translations, of the proposed draft agreement by Sheikh Mubarak to lease to the British Government the land to the south of the Bunder Shweikh and of the draft agreement by myself accepting the conditions on behalf of the British Govern ment. 2. It Is unfortunate that Sheikh Mubarak should hesitale to sign the agree ment m question without receiving a duly authorised acceptance in form from myself .but to press the point too firmly would only excite greater suspicion and might imperil the success of the negotiations. 3. I have been solemnly assured by Sheikh Mubarak that he will affix his signature, witnessed by his son, Sheikh Jabir, to the document, as soon as 1 am ready to give him a document duly signed by myself accepting the conditions to which he has agreed. 4. It will be impossible for him to plead ignorance of the agreement, as it has been prepared finallv by his own confidential secretary and, in the preliminary stages was read over letter by letter and discussed most carefully between us. The Arabic draft remains, of course, in my personal custody. I trust that the notes appended by me to the translation together with ihe quasi-telegraphic despatch sent by me in haste to you last mail will show fully the course the negotiations have taken. 5. With regard to the form of the accepting agreement, I venture to hope that it will be allowed to stand in the main, though verbal alterations here and there can be inserted, as Sheikh Mubarak has not yet been told what form this letter will take. It would, 1 think, allay a good deal of suspicion, if I am authorised, on the part of Government, to give some assurance that it is not the wish ot Government to interfere in Koweit except for the laudable, harmless motives, mentioned in the accepting agreement and that the Government wishes to see the Sheikh of Koweit powerful, independent and beholden to nobody. 6. I shall make one more effort to obtain in writing from Sheikh, Mubarak i the assurance made verbally and detailed in paragraph 3 above. If, however, l fail I would recommend that I may be authorised to accept in the form indicated and I would urge that it is extremely important that there should be as little delay as possible in what, I venture to hope, may be the final stage of the negoti ations. 7. A more formal acceptance, signed either by the Resident or higher authority, as the wisdom of Government may direct, might follow in due course, if it should be considered advisable. 8. I think I may safely say that, while Sheikh Mubarak hesitates to com mit himself, he and his son, Sheikh Jabir, are both delighted at the course events have taken, less 1 believe on account of the actual profit to them over the deal, C380FDthan because they take it to be an indication of a strong policy for the future and an assurance that the railway from Baghdad to the sea will be in the hands of the English and that the terminus will be at Bunder Shweikh. 9. 1 am forced, at the moment of closing the mails to reopen this letter, as the Sheikh’s letter, in which he admitted in writing to me that the draft agreement met with his approval, introduced conditions foreign to the actual lease and especially a dangerously ambiguous clause relating to Customs. I promptly visited the Sheikh, but found that he would not consent to treating the customs as a separate matter and his especial fear was that, as soon as we had got the Shweikh lands into our hands, we should say to him—“ Yes, you can take customs dues in your town and we will take them within our limits.” I assured him that Government had no intention whatever of taking customs dues and pointed out to him that the clause, as it stood, would allow him or his successors, in a mo ment of displeasure, to enhance customs dues to such an extent as to kill trade and render our concession nugatory. * - 10. We then agreed to submit to the wisdom of Government the following ge' eral principle to be enunciated in the agreement accepting Sheikh Mubarak’s - offer to lease, viz., that Government, on their part, agree not to collect customs dues within the boundaries of Koweit and that Sheikh Mubarak, on his part, binds himself to furnish a customs schedule with a percentage rate based on present day rates, as taken from his own subjects, to be applicable to all British subjects or British Indian subjects or other subjects of His Gracious Majesty, the King-Emperor, and that the rates are not to be increased without the con sent of both parties. 11. I am fully conscious of the inconvenience of introducing a customs regulation in*o the middle of a lease, but to have insisted on its exclusion would have roused Sneikh Mubarak’s suspicions to such an extent as would have im perilled the whole course of the negotiations. Of itself, it would appear tp me that the fixing of a regular customs rate on British and British Indian subjects is a distinct advantage, for, although the customs rate is higher than it used to be in Koweit, it compares favourably with the old Ottoman rate of 8 per cent, or the Persian rates and is, on the whole, favourable, and it will be extremely useful that it should not be altered except with our consent. 12. Sheikh Mubarak also implied that he required the letter of acceptance from Government, by which he means a letter signed by myself duly empowered in that behalf, should also follow closely and in detail the* agreement to lease, signed by himself. There appears to be no objection to this course. 13. lam compelled, therefore, with much misgiving and regret, to suggest that I should be empowered to do the best I can in the circumstances and to give to Sheikh Mubarak a letter which should follow closely, mutatts mutandis, (1) the agreement to lease, (2) the form suggested in paragraph 5 above, and (3) the general principle, enunciated in paragraph 10 above and in Sheikh Mubarak’s letter of which I have the honour to enclose herewith a copy and translation in duplicate. . Translation of Sheikh Mubarak' s letter, dated the 11 th Rajah 132 $ H., corres ponding to 21 st August IQOJ, in which he admits that the draft agreement leasing the Shweikh lands, has been approved by him subject to acceptance of the conditions by the British Government. From Mubarak-us-Subah, ruler of Koweit, to the presence of the high- placed Major Knox, Political Agent of the precious Imperial English Govern ment in Koweit (may he endure for ever). ;i After asking after your dear heart, afterwards, with reference to the paper which comprehends the detailed boundaries in the lands of Shweikh and the lease as mentioned in the paper which I gave to Major Knox and of which a copy is with me, I am accepting everything that is mentioned therein. Then if the precious Imperial English Government approves in their exalted sight that r f L'3 ’(agreement), then I also ask for a paper, following that one in detail from the ^Government which shall remain in my hand and also it shall be detailed .in the paper given by the Government that my town, is to me and its boundaries like wise and all my arrangements remain in my hand in the matter of customs, etc., and all my arrangements at the present day to me and to my heirs after me and, in the matter of the Shweikh lands and of the lands which the Government may, ,in the future, rent from me, the Government is to be bound in the paper that they will not take customs on anything in all the lands which they may rent or in which they dwell within the limits of Koweit. ^ As for the customs of Koweit, its arrangements are in my hands and to my heirs after me and there shall be an arrangement for the customs dues from the subjects of the Government.

' This agreement is from me, Sheikh Mubarak-us-Subah, ruler of Koweit, on behalf of myself and on behalf of my heirs to Major Knox, Political Agent of the precious Imperial English Government at Koweit, on behalf of the English Government. ; ’ ' * ; The reason of writing this paper is that I, Sheikh Mubarak-us-Subah, ruler of Koweit, have leased in perpetuity to the English Government the land of which the boundaries are detailed below south of Bunder Shweikh.

Fifthly. —And further, in consideration of the rent detailed, I, Sheikh Mubarak, confirm on my own behalf and on behalf of my heirs, my former promise that neither I nor my heirs will grant, sell or lease to a foreign Government and in this is included the Ottoman Government or to the subjects of any Foreign Gov ernment any of our land within Koweit boundaries or around it without the permission of the precious English Government. Sixthly.— also I, Sheikh Mubarak, and my heirs, am bound in this paper that we will give to the English Government the right of pre-emption in sale or lease of the lands detailed below :— Firstly. —The lands which lie adjacent to the lands detailed at a distance of 2,000 cubits in any direction from the nearest boundary of the leased lands but to my subjects, the people of Koweit, to them shall be a right of pre-emption stronger and prior to that of the English Government in this special land.

I am to state, in reply, that it seems Important, In the first instance, to secure the rectangular plot at Bunder Shweik, as this is apparently the best, if not the only terminus; that a letter, of which a copy is enclosed, has accordingly been addressed to the Treasury on the subject. I am to suggest that the acquisition of further sites, which in some instances would raise questions of territorial jurisdiction, might be considered at an early date by a Conference of representatives of the India The Under Secretary of State, India Office.India Office, Admiralty and Foreign Office; that the negotiations respecting Bunder Shweik need not be de layed until the report of this Conference has been considered, though the agreement relating to Bunder Shweik should if possible include a clause reserving to His Majesty's Government the right of preemption in regard to any further sites suitable for a term! nus which are or may be within the jurisdiction of the Sheikh of Koweit; that the reservation of enclaves is an objection, though not insuperable, and that it must, if inevitable, be admitted. I am to add that Sir E. Grey concurs in the views of the Government of India as to (l) Customs; (2) Slaves; (3) Independence; but that the status of Warba Island would be a point for consideration by the proposed Conference. If these views meet with the concurrence of Mr Secretary Morley, I am to enquire whether your De partment would enter forthwith into the necessary communications with the Admiralty, with a view to expedition. A i 1 , - ^r Copy. FOREIGN OFFICE. September I6th.l907. Immediate and Most Confidential. Sir:- I am directed by Secretary Sir E, Grey to state, for the information of the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury, that, in view of a recent decision of the Cabinet in regard to the future attitude of this coun try towards the Bagdad Railway question, he has been in conmunication with the Secretary of State for India res pecting the advisability of acquiring a portion of the foreshore at Koweit, which is considered to possess capabilities as a harbour forming the terminus of a great railway superior to those of any other port on the Persian Gulf. It is manifest that the possession of the land in k question (which the German Government have already at- ■ tempted to acquire) would immeasurably strengthen the position of this Country in any negotiations which may hereafter take place in regard to British participation The Secretary to the Treasury.in the Bagdad Railway: an undertaking which, if con structed under exclusively German auspices, could not fail to have a prejudicial effect upon British influ ence, Doth political and commercial, in the Middle East The Interest ol Great Britain in a railway which, if completed, would form the most direct mail route to Ii Gia is indeed so evident as to require no demonstra tion. But, apart from the political aspects of the question, the commercial position of Great Britain in the Mesopotamian delta is altogether exceptional. This position has been steadily consolidated since the foun dation, upwards of two and a half centuries ago, of the first English factory at Bussorah; in 1766 a British Resident was appointed at Bagdad; at Bussorah there has long been a British Consul, charged with the care of British trade, represented by 96 per cent of the shipping coming into the port, and by the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company, who are the principal carriers of merchandise between Bussorah and Bagdad, and who are subsidised by the Government of India for the carriage of mails. Such is now the nature of these commercial interests that the trade of Bagdad and BussorahJrfl Bussorah, valued at £2,500,000 in 1903, is predominant ly in the hands of British and Indian merchants. In thdse circumstances His Majesty*s Government have de cided that every effort must he made to render the co operation of Great Britain desirable to the promoters of the Bailway. Preliminary negotiations with the Sheikh of Koweit have shown that he is prepared to agree to the lease of a rectangular plot at Bunder Sheikh, 3,750 yards along tine sea face by 300 yards in depth, for a perpetual rent of £4,000 a year, the Sheikh reserving a plot ^ 150 yards square in the centre of the larger plot. Out- ;■ | I sido the British reservation above-described. His Ma jesty’s Government would have a right of preemption to a further area extending to a distance of 1,000 yards from the limits of the British reservation, subject only to the prior rights of Koweit subjects. This offer lapses if not accepted by the 14th. October. Sir E. Grey is of opinion that no time should be lost in accepting the terms offered by the Sheikh. It is not considered probable that such advantageous terms are likely to be offered again. InIn these circumstances Sir E. Grey trusts that the Lords Commissioners will sanction the grant of a yearly sum of £2,000, the balance to be paid by the Government of India. He further considers that it is desirable to afford a pretext for the purchase of the land in question by providing the Agent at Koweit with a steam launch, the reasons for which were fully explained in my letters of January 9th. and March 6th. and enclo sures. If a launch is provided it is essential that a coaling station, to be located on the site above- mentioned, should be established, since the acquisition of a site by His Majesty^ Government could not other wise fail to arouse the susceptibilities of other Powers. I am therefore to express the hope that the Lords Commissioners will reconsider their decision not to contribute towards the cost of purchase and upkeep of a launch. In conclusion I am to state that an early decision on the subject of this letter is of great importance. I am, &amp;c.. (Signed)) € rk ^ bfi COPY. Telegram P.

Dated Bushire, 19th August 1907. Received the 20th August *07. 12-qo'i Political Agent, Koweit, telegraphed on August 14th, as follows Begins. Bunder Shweikh negotia tions are taking better turn than I expected. Sheikh Mobarak has taken the pearl out of the Oyster for himself by reserving the coal house recently erected, with sur rounding compound 150 yards square, coal house occupying the centre of the north-west of sea side. Apart from that reservation he grants us rectangular plot of ground measuring 3750 yards by 300 yards at a perpetual rent of Rs. CO,000 per annum which is to be paid in adavance. The north-west boundary 3750 yards long is in a direct line and roughly parallel to the foreshorebut must contain coal house or compound Subject to these two conditions position is at our option. Rent gives a right, without further demand, to all foreshore to depth of 3 fathoms at lowest spring tide between north-east and south-west boundaries produced to north-west except as regards portion immediately in front of Mobarak's reservation and also gives full liberty to erect buildings of any kind, to sublet to British, British Indian, and Koweit subjects to put down buoys and carry out all works necessary to ease passage of steamers from open sea to harbour of Schweikh. Area of land now granted is more than twelve time//that originally asked for, and rent is, therefore, proportionately one-third of Cox's limit. I strongly recommend that I should be empowered to accept at once without further question. Koweit subjects' right of pre-emption or priority of lease is stronger than ours to the land surrounding the present concession to distance of 1000 yards from any point of our boundary but otherwise Grovernment has precedence over all comers with respect to such land. Government has absolute right of pre emption or priority of lease to Island of Schweikh and its foreshore also called on chart Kurain . Government hashas absolute right of pre-emption or priority of lease to Ras Kathama and foreshore to limit two nautical miles in any direction but Sheikh reserves to himself land for Baghirmi, within boundaries of total linear length of 600 yards, some where at his option near Ras Kathama but will grant to Bov em inent a right of way to sea 15 ft. broad if such is found necessary.Kathama land can only be leased. Concession also contains clause asserting spirit of declaration of independence and Sheikh Mobarak's determination not to part with his rights in land to any Foreign Bovernment including Turkey or to their subjects without consent of British Bovernment being asked and granted. This clause was dictated by Sheikh. Agreement is terminable at option of British Bovern ment only. Sheikh Mobarak also binds his heirs but his signature only holds good for two months. If within that period Bovernment consents agreement is binding. If not h£^ now terms can be arranged. Further demi-official written to catch mail states Sheikh has now interpolated following words, M And as long as I perceive that their kindness and after me my children then I am as I have mentioned in the paper of agreement I will not consent that any other power should interfere except them (British Bovernment) even if they gave me more than this rent except if we see the circumstances changed after meMMMMHBSSSnS I and my heirs for man i_s the at least kindness and to us is the enjoyment of our property.' Ends. Captain Knox considers this interpolation objection able, and will endeavour to get it removed as it suggests es possibility of subsequent cancellation of lease by Sheikh. He adds that Sheikh being greatly irritated against Turks present opportunity is exceptionally favourable Sheikh's mood may however change.

Following telegram received from Major Cox, dated Shiraz, 3rd September :— “ Your telegram of 29th August. I have asked for full details as to existing Customs tariff. In the last connection it might perhaps be advisable to ask Shaikh to add that, in settlement of future disputes between his Customs Department and British or foreign subjects, he will be guided, to a reasonable extent, by the friendly advice of British Government or their representative. “ With reference to proposed guarantee of internal autonomy, it is probable that question of right of our representative to manumit fugitive slaves, with or without his concurrence, might become difficult sooner or later. For this reason, while giving guarantee, government might perhaps consider following alternative courses “ First, either omit all reference to slave trade in the present document, and then, a short time afterwards, ask Shaikh to conclude slave trade agreement with us; or secondly, when giving guarantee, add confident hope that, should it become necessary, Shaikh will conclude such a Convention. I should be inclined to trust to his increasing amenableness and adopt first alternative. “ In connection with reference to rights of Turkey, it is not clear whether . group number 233 of telegram under reply should be interpreted “affecting” or “hazarding.” in any case, could not all mention of Turkey be avoided? I have not seen written text of draft agreement, but I gather that Shaikh, in this particular document, only asks us to undertake to respect his internal independence ourselves. “ I recommend that, if Political Agent, thinks that it is still possible, grant of a right of pre-emption over Warba, &amp;c., as well as Kathama, be included in present agreement, but that, in order not to delay signature, the deter mination of provisional prices be delayed, if necessary, for a supplementary agreement. “Subject to above observations, I respectfully subscribe to the proposals and views advanced by Government of India to Secretary of State for India.” We recommend as follows :— 1st. Customs. We think Shaikh may be expected, without formal agreement, to be guided to a reasonable extent by our friendly advice in such matters, and as regards foreigners, we have suggested, in despatch posted 5th September, that we should get Shaikh to agree to be guided by our advice in his foreign relations. We would not, therefore, endanger conclusion of lease by putting forward stipulation proposed by Cox. 2nd. Slaves. We do not think it advisable to complicate question of lease by raising the question of slaves ; but if it appears at any future time that we can press matter upon the Shaikh’s attention, without incurring nis resentment, we shall be ready to do so. 3rd. Guarantee of internal independence. We had not intended to suggest that there should be any mention in the agreement of Turkey’s possible rights, but had merely exxdained that such guarantee need not affect Turkish rights, if any. 4th. Warba Island. We concur in Cox’s recommendation. We have now received draft agreements from Major Knox, and copies were forwarded with Foreign Secretary’s weekly letter of 5th September. ‘Ay n &amp; &lt;7From Viceroy, 27th August 1907. ?&gt;47 '7 n/» ^4 % 2117 * !&gt; ( Foreign Secret. Koweit Foreshore. Your telegram of £hth July. Knox reported, 14th August, that Sheikh was willing to grant us rectangular plot, measuring three thousand seven hundred and fifty yards along sea face by three hundred yards in depth, at Bunder Shweikh, for perpetual rent of sixt y thousand rupees a year. Sheikh reserves plot of one hundred and fifty yards square in centre of our reservation, where he has built small coal shed, near outcrop of rocks shown in chart sent with Foreign Secretary’s letter No. 30 M., 27th July 1905. Rent gives right, without further demand, to all foreshore facing grant, except portion opposite Sheikh’s enclave, to depth of three fathoms at lowest spring tides, with full liberty to build, or sub-let, to British or Koweit subjects, and also to construct all works necessary to open passage for steamers from open sea. Koweitis have prior right of pre-emption to area within one thousand yards of reservation, but, failing them, we secure precedence of all others. We also secure pre-emption, or priority of lease, to island of Kurein , and priority of lease ’ to Ras Kathama, and foreshore there to limit of two nautical miles m any direction, but Sheikh reserves enclave six hundred yards in linear length within such reservation. Draft of concession also includes declaration dictated by Sheikh that he will not part with rights in land to Turkey, or any other power, without consent of British Govern ment. Sheikh subsequently wished interpolation of w r ords restricting operation for period during which he, and his children, experience British kindness, but Knox hopes to get this condition removed. Sheikh is angry with Turks and present opportunity very favourable. Knox recommends that offer, which is only open for two months, should be accepted at once, as Sheikh’s mood may change. Subject to opinion of Cox, which will be telegraphed, we concur, and ask to be authorised to make best terms we can with Sheikh in general sense of his draft concession, on understanding mentioned in your telegram that His Majesty’s Government will meet half charge. We would try to fix pric e and rent for Shweikh Island and Katham a, in case we wisli lo secure these hereafter. We would, however, point out that concession, while securing port of Koweit, does not close Khor Abdulla to foreign enter prise, and the papers sent with Secretary’s letter No. 52 M., dated 27th December 1906, indicate that the possibility of developing a harbour, or even a ship canal to Basrah, by this route, cannot be overlooked. ’We would draw attention to our Despatch of 2nd August 1906. It might even be possible, now the Sheikh Mubarak appears to be in a reasonable mood, to secure from him a right of future pre-emption, at a price fixed now , over Warba Island and the anchorages north and southTof the island, with the adjacent foreshores, within a distance of three nautical miles of the Island, so far as they lie within his b*M. With this, we should command all possible railway outlets on western shore of the head of the Gulf. The possibility of line being taken across Shat-el-Arab to Khormusa is remote. IA* /w* ^ s.fc. Later telegram from Bushire, 23rd August:— “ ‘ Redbreast ’ has brought further papers from Koweit showing the progress of negotiations. “ Sheikh has given Political Agent written approval of draft agreement embodying terms already stated, with omission of objectionable interpolation. In return, he requires from Political Agent, on behalf of Government, formal acceptance of terms of lease, guarantee on the part of Government of his internal independence, and promise not to take customs duties on anything in the land to be rented, and to leave control of Koweit customs to him. In return for the latter, he guarantees to fix custom duties against British subjects on the basis of his present schedule, such schedule not to be altered without consent of Government. Political Agent regrets the introduction of stipulations regarding customs, and proposed to Sheikh to treat this as separate matter, but is now convinced that refusal would rouse suspicion of Sheikh and imperil negotiations. He also urges inclusion in formal acceptance of assurances of desire of Government to see Sheikh, and his heirs, strong and independent.” As to proposed guarantee of internal independence, we understand Sheikh’s suggestion to be that we shall guarantee not to interfere with his internal autonomy, such guarantee not to affect rights, if any, of Turkey. On such understanding we see no objection to proposed guarantee. As regards Customs, our latest information is that Sheikh levies import duty of five per cent, ad m£ore??i on all commodities. We see no primd facie objection to Sheikh’s proposals on this head, but will communicate matured opinion later. As to suggestion by Knox for inclusion of declaration that British Government wishes to see Sheikh strong and independent, we do not consider any such declaration necessary, if Sheikh does not himself press for it.No. 1614 , dated Bushire, the 28 th July (received 5 th August) 1907 .

No. 315 , dated Koweit, the 25 th June 1907 . From—-MAJOR S, G. Knox, Political Agent, Koweit, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. _ I have the honour to invite a reference to the confidential correspondence ending with your office endorsement No. 335 , dated 10 th February 1907 , on the subject of the acquisition of a portion of the foreshore of Shweikh anchorage. p.. On the 6 th June, the Sheikh refused me the lease of a piece of ground outside the town to the south, of which he had practically made me a grant. The measurements and rent had been agreed upon and its general position decided upon verbally and the Sheikh had sent with me his confidential servant Abdulla bin Hajri to measure the ground, and boundary pillars had been fixed. All this took place on the 2 nd June, and I saw the Sheikh once or twice between that date and the 6 th and the matter was mentioned, but it was only when I sent up Mulla Abdulla bin Abul Ilahi, my munshi, to ask for the written lease that the Sheikh sent a reply to say that he would like to talk the matter over once again. I went to see him the same afternoon and he explained that he felt difficulties about what the Basrah authorities would say when they heard of a grant of land in such a conspicuous position and he asked me to let him off his promise and said that he would grant me the garden of Shahin bin Ghanim, for which we have been in treaty for ten weary months. He even gratuitously promised to deal gently in the matter of rent. 3 . I at once agreed, saying that the last thing I wished was to expose the Sheikh to any persecution or difficulties at the hands of the Basrah authorities but I asked him to consider that, if the difficulties in the way of a grant of bare desert land with no conspicuous advantages were so insurmountable, what would the Basrah authorities say to the grant to the British authorities of the Bunder Shweikh foreshore. 4 . The Sheikh replied that there would be no great difficulty about that, as the sale or lease would be confidential and that he vvou'd explain any works or erections by saying that they were his own for the convenience of his own launch and informed me that he had already erected a coal shed on the spot. This was a complete surprise to me, for I had left Bunder Shweikh studiously alone for some time, but I believe I received the shock without flinching and made no comment upon it. 5 . I merely asked the Sheikh that, in consideration of the fact that the grant of the land for camel stables had been made so publicy and that men, under my orders, had actually been digging wells upon it, I would only ask him (wj*) (fri (^uoj l a r ’ d b / \ \ ta to expedite the lease of Shahin s garden, so as to avoid public comment both for his sake and for mine. He promised faithfully to send Abdulla ul Hairi to measure the garden and that the lease should be despatched to me on Friday evening, the yth, at the very latest. Abdulla measured the garden all right but I have not seen a line of the lease and thought it best to avoid further humilia tion by not asking for it. 6 . It seemed to me advisable to let the Bunder Shweikh matter rest and I made no official report, until I had an opportunity of seeing what the Sheikh had actually done. I made the opportunity for myself last evening and the Sheikh has erected a substantial stone building on the shore immediately opposite the rocks or coral reef of which such frequent mention is made in the correspondence on the subject. r . 7 - It is impossible to say precisely what explanation Sheikh Mubarek will give of this erection of a new building in the centre of a plot of ground under HJpst obvious inference from this and many similar instances of Brer Rabbit diplomacy is that he regards neither verbal nor written promises as binding, whether made to the British Government, the Resident in the rersian Gulf or to a mere underling like myself. G. C. Press, Simla—No.C.301 F. D.— io-8»o7.— &lt;&gt; —J. D.No. 25 of 1904. GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, FOREIGN DEPARTMENT. SECRET. External. The Eight Hon’ble St. JOHN BEODEICK, His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, Pout William, the 4th February 1904. Sir, In his Secret despatch No. 196, dated the 17th December, His Excellency the Yiceroy briefly mentioned his recent visit to Koweit and the Khor Abdulla, and the prospects of the shores of this waterway as a future possible railway terminus. We now have the honour to address you in greater detail on the ^2. It will be within the recollection of His Majesty’s Government that early in 1902 it was reported that the Turks had established a post at the head of the *Khor Abdulla. The Commander of H. M. S. “ Sphinx”, who was sent to enquire into the matter, visited the locality between the 14th and the 19th of Eebruarv. and reported that, in addition to a position which they had occupied at Urn Kasr, the Turks had, for the first time about a fortnight previously, stationed a force of some 20 men on the south-east corner of Bubiyan island. This unwarranted encroachment was at once brought to the notice of your predecessor, reference was made to the importance of the positions seized, and it w T as proposed by the Viceroy that the Turks should be told that they must at once leave Bubiyan, even if no protest were offered against the occupation of Urn Kasr. On the 26th March, Lord George Hamilton telegraphed that it was considered inadvisable to raise irritating discussions about the move ments of Turkish troops to places to which the Sheikh s title would be difficult to prove, and it was explained that His Majesty’s Government did not wish to obstruct the prolongation of the Baghdad Railway to the Gulf, whether at Koweit or elsewhere. It was added, however, that their assistance would be conditional upon British capital receiving, in respect of construction, materials, and management, at least equal shares with any other Power. ^ In the event, no action was taken to assert the Chief s claims beyond an intimation to the Porte that their action was regarded as constituting a disturbance of the status quo, and that the occupation of the places in question could not be regarded as in any way prejudicing the Sheikh’s rights and authority over them, and the Turkish posts still remain at Urn Kasr and A1 Geit, where they were then established. 3. The importance of the question lies in its relation to ^ the futuie probable terminus of what is known as the Baghdad Railway. Article I of the Convention, dated the 21st January 1902, between the Turkish Government and the promoters of this enterprise provides that the projected railway shall run from Zoheir to a point on the Persian Gulf to be determined by mutual agreement between the Ottoman Porte and the Company, and there appears to be no doubt that the Turkish advance of 1902 to the shores of Khor Abdulla and the island of Bubiyan was designed to enable the concessionaires to secure, without reference to His Majesty’s Government, what was already recognised by the German Engineers, and has since been generally acknowledged to be, the most suitable terminus on the Gulf. The first section of the line is now,I'' ; «' *&gt; r ti we understand, in course of construction by German enterprise unaided, and no arrangements have been made, ^ as far as we are aware, in respect of any portion of the railway from Konia to the Persian Gulf for securing the condition whereby His Majesty’s Government contemplated that equality of treatment should be secured for British capital. ^ 7 4. Buying his recent tour in the Gulf the Viceroy personally visited the Hhor Abdulla, m company with the Naval Commander-in-Chief on the East Indies Station, and the result of the inspection was to confirm the view which we pieviously entertained of the importance of the Khor and of the superiority * of its shores, for the purpose of a railway terminus, over any of the sites in the immediate neighbourhood of Koweit which have previously claimed attention. On board the “ Lawrence”, Their Excellencies passed up the channel to the anchorage below the junction of Khor Zobeir with Khor Urn Kasr and except at the eastern end of Warba Island, where, there is a bar with a depth of two fathoms for a short distance, a depth of four and-a-half fathoms was obtained throughout. The anchorage is some three miles from Um Kasr post, and the banks of the channel are sufficiently high to provide a firm and convenient landing place. To the south of the Warba Island lies the large sheet of water with plenty of depth and room for an anchorage, to which Bear- Admiral Willes refers in paragraph 50 of his letter No. 209—1171, dated 8th December 1903, to the Secretary to the Admiralty, of which we enclose a copy. Owing to the length of the channel and its capacity for easy land or submarine defences, a port in either of these localities would be absolutely safe from any attack from the seaward. J We have already intimated in our Secret despatch No. 16, dated the 21st January 1904, that the remarks of the Naval Commander-in-Chief in paragraph 51 of this letter were written under a misapprehension, and do not accmately represent the political position. It is not necessary here, therefore to take them into account. * 5. In our Secret despatch No. 27 (Frontier), dated the 4th February 1901 we have mrntioned the probable antagonism of German interests to our own in Ibis quarter and the attitude which, in our opinion, should be adopted towards the designs of other nations in Turkish Arabia, and we consider that no time should be lost in endeavouring to retrieve so far as may still be possible the position whicu we have so seriously endangered by acquiescence in these encroachments So far a^ concerns Um Kasr and the neighbouring mainland, the claims of the Sheikh of Koweit do not appear to have been strong. But whatever may have been their validity, it would be difficult, and we would not now propose to tiy, to induce the Turks to abandon the occupation which for the past year they have been permitted to maintain. The case of Bubiyan Island we regard as entirely different. Here we consider that the Sheikh has claims which can be sustained alike with better reason, with greater prospect of success arid owing to its insular position, with smaller risk of subsequent embarrassment * No. 42, dated the 28th February 1902. OUrSClvCS. In February 1902 OUr Politi f a l R e? id ®t in the Persian Gulf ,, , x reported* that Sheikh Mubarak had addressed to him a written communication in which he advanced his claim to the island, and asserted that the Avazem tribe, who are his subjects had lived there since the occupation of Koweit for seven months during the summer of each year, and had established fishing enclosures on the island. Colonel Kemball regarded the pretension as valid, and a like view appears to have been held by His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople, who a few days t Sir Nicolas O’Conor to the Marquess of Lans- later telegraphed! to the Mfl,rmiPe« of downe, No. 33, dated the 16th March 1902. T +1-. 4-1 t ^ ^ ’ i o, x Lansdowne that the Consul at Basrah considered the Sheikh s claim to the island to be good. Sir Nicolas O’Conor t Sir Nicolas &lt; ?’ c&lt; f 10 1 r t( l the Marquess of Lans- however, expressed! the opinion that there downe, No. 30, dated the llth March 1902. wnc -nn nPiao-t 1 ^ , • T 1 J 1 -1 1 • m f - Object in raising a conflict about Bubiyan Island while leaving the Turks m possession of Um Kasr Had the Ambassador then been in possession of the information which is now available we believe that he would not have entertained this view. With the shores of the mainland and of Bubiyan Island in the possession of a single Power the anchorages below Um Kasr and at Warba Island can at any time be convertedinto an impregnable harbour: and even if the day is still distant when the banks of the Khor Abdulla are likely to be armed with foreign forts or batteries, the undivided occupation by a German Railway Company of a potentially invulnerable position is not calculated to conduce to the enhancement either of British commercial prosperity or of British political prestige. Supposing, however, that we are able to make good Sheikh Mubarak’s claims/ we at once place ourselves in a position to establish, at the north end of Bubiyan -^Jsland, a post which would command not only the anchorage but also the approaches up the Khor Abdulla, and we acquire the power to assert, in such a manner as our paramount interests demand, our right to participate in all arrangements relative to the prospective terminus of the Anatolian Railway. An additional argument, if any is needed, in favour of strengthening our position at Bubiyan may, perhaps, be found in the fact that the Khor is used as a place of refuge by pirates whom the Turkish Government is unable to control and who, as shown in the Administration Report of the Persian Gulf for 1902-03, commit piracies off Bubiyan. 6. His Majesty’s Government have never admitted the Turkish claim to the island, and have, indeed, protested against the interference with the status quo involved in the placing of a post at A1 Geit, where, prior to the month of Pebruary 1902, the Turks had never pretended to exercise an authority even of the most shadowy description, and where the total garrison now consists of some 6 men. On the same occasion we were informed by • Telegram of sth April 1902. ^ord George Hamilton* that the British Government would resist a Turkish ad vance on the Koweit side of Subbiyeh. This place is separated only by a channel from the southern end of Bubiyan Island: and the claims of the Sheikh to both positions seem to us to be of equal validity. 7. The proposal accordingly which we submit for your consideration is that the Porte should now be informed that we are unable to recognise their right to maintain a station on Bubiyan, and should be requested to withdraw their troops; while at the same time we should establish a post on behalf of Sheikh Mubarak on the northern end of the island opposite to the southern anchorage. The Sheikh has always urged his claims to this island, and during the Viceroy’s visit to Koweit he repeatedly asked why the Turks were not compelled to evacuate both Bubiyan and Um Kasr which belonged to him. He has several boats, and could easily with small support from us prevent Turkish troops from crossing the Khor Subbiyeh or channel between Bubiyan and the mainland on the west. Should His Majesty’s Government deem it advisable to spare the Sultan’s susceptibilities by the adoption of a less pronounced course of action, we think it possible that our object might be secured by intimating that we regard Bubiyan Island as belong ing to the Sheikh, and that, unless the Turkish force is withdrawn, we shall be constrained to support him in establishing a post on the northern shore to balance the Turkish posts at Um Kasr and A1 Geit. In this case the Turks would probably retire, and the island 'would remain unoccupied. The Sheikh w r ould then resume possession, and it would only remain for us to carry out hereafter such further measures as might be necessary for the maintenance of our legitimate interests.

Inform Sheikh that the question of the Sultan’s rights over Koweit was discussed with the Porte in September last, and that we then received from His Majesty a distinct assurance that he would respect the status quo at Koweit and abstain from sending troops there. There can be no reason for fresh assertion of Sultan’s rights, or for attempt to further define them, which, if not superfluous, must clearly involve alteration. The action of the Nakib appears to constitute a distinct violation of the Sultan’s promise, and in these circumstances His Majesty’s Government are prepared to support the Sheikh, and will not tolerate an attack by Turkish troops or ships upon Koweit. The Sheikh should not leave Koweit, and should continue to observe his engagement with us. A communication has been addressed to the Porte complainino' of the Nakib’s conduct, and demanding that he be instructed to desist from exercising pressure upon the Sheikh.i nfb {Confidential) ,; v &gt;- r ., Na. 332:^ dated BusMre, the 10th (received 19th) February 1907. From—M ajor P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian 0 ulf, To 3 xr Louis Daub, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Secretary to the Government o£ India in the Foreign Department. In continuation of my telegram No; 395, dated 10th October 1906, I acquisition of the foreshore of Bunder Shweikh in Koweit harbour. 2. Briefly summarised, the purport o£ these reports seems to be as follows:— Sheikh Mubarak evinces his readiness to let us have a piece of frontage measuring 1,200 Z tra’s (600 yards approximately) in length wherever we like to select it, and having a depth of 200 Zara’s back from highwater mark and carrying with it the disposal of the space between this frontage and the three fathom line. It will be seen from the “ Survey of the Port of Koweit,” dated April 1905, issued by the Debra Dun Survey Office, that this length of foreshore would give us the whole of the valuable rock-fronted strip in the neighbourhood of position B shown therein. If we attach great imp stance to the purchase outright of the site selected, Sheikh Mubarak is willing so to part with it, but his inclinations are rather in favour of a yearly “ quit-rent,” by which I understand Major Knox to mean an unalterable amount to be paid by us annually as long as we need the site. In other words, rather than receive a lump sum the Sheikh would prefer that we should recompense him for the transfer of the ground to us by giving him a yearly subsidy. Major Knox suggests that in the first instance we should either make him an offer of quit-rent at the rate of Rs. 2 per linear Zara’ (=2,4.00 rupees per annum) or, in the alternative of buying the ground outright, at ils. 50,000— about 20 years’ purchase. He anticipates however that Sheikh Mubarak may not be satisfied with these terms and may even endeavour to ruu the figures up to four times the amounts just mentioned. 3. Sheikh Mubarak, after several times speaking of it in parables, has now specifically raised the question of a subsidy and referred to his interview with Lord Curzon, and I venture to express the opinion that the acquisition of this ground furnishes us with a convenient opening for inaugurating such a subsidy in an indirect way which would give the lurks or others as little ground as possible for suspicion or demur. We might record an agreement to pay Sheikh Mubarak a certain substantial sum as quit-rent for this ground in an ordinary deed of transfer, and in another subsidiary and secret document we might stipulate that a certain proportion of the sum referred to in the first documnnt was to be considered contingent on the friendly attitude and steadfast adherence of the Sheikh to his treaty engagements with us. To start with the offer might be made of Rs. 1,250 per mensem, out of which in the subsidiary agreement it would be stated that the payment of Rs. 1,000 per mensem would be subject to the conditions abovementioned. Considering the possibly vital importance which may attach to this piece of foreshore, the figure is inconsiderable, and at the above rates would be the precise amount originally suggested as a suitable subsidy, namely, Rs. 15,000 per annum. 4. Upon the general question of our subsidising Sheikh Mubarak I need hardly dilate. It was fully discussed by my predecessor in his letter No. 25, of^th February 1904, to your address, pursuant to the visit of His Excel- * Resident to Foreign Department, No. T-io, Sheikh Mubarak in establishing posts on have the honour to submit copies of two O , , - ^ the progress of his negociations with Sheikh Mubarak in connection with the lency Lord Curzon to the Persian Gulf, and was subsequently mooted in +&gt; connection with the proposal to support Bubian Island.^ Possibly it is still under consideration in conjunction with that question. 4481 F. D.4 i - h. w wt I 2 Prom the point of view of the Government of India’s local representative, I have always J)een strongly in favour of the grant of a subsidy to Sheikh Mubarak as being a course calculated to strengthen our position with him con siderably. It seems to be a doubly politic measure at the present epoch when we have to contemplate the lively probability both of German efforts for closer relations with Mubarak through the medium of the Hamburg-Ameriean .Line; and of the necessity of inaugurating up to date quarantine measures at Koweit; a project which will be one of no small delicacy and which it is of the first importance that we should take in hand for him. In making the foregoing observations I should mention that I have had in mind a purely political subsidy. The Government of India must be well aware that any payment intended to be compensatory for loss resulting to Sheikh Mubarak in connection with the suppression of the Arms Traffic would have to he considered on a considerably more liberal scale. 5. In the final paragraph of his last report the Political Agent suggests that it would be as well for us to refrain from further discussion with sTieikh Mubarak for two or three months; nevertheless, if His Majesty’s Government are able to come to a provisional decision in the meanwhile as to how far they are prepared to go in the direction under correspondence, I should be glad if we could immediately be put in possession of it, in case Sheikh Mubarak should himself return to the question. 6. In conclusion, I trust that the Government of India in reading the accompaniments to this_ letter will consider as I do that Major Knox deserve credit for the way in which he is handling the negociations. No. 37, dated the 21st January 1907, From Major S. G. Knox, I.A., Political Agent, Koweit, To— Major P. Z. Cox, C..I.E, Political Kesident in the Persian Gulf. 1 have the honour to inform you that the acquisition of a landing place near the harbour at Shweikh has been the subject of conversation at one or two inter views held with the Sheikh of Koweit by me recently and I found myself compelled to accede to the Sheikh’s request that I should visit the spot with him and point out exactly my requirements. 2. I was fortunately able to gi\re the visit as innocent an aspect as was possible m the circumstances, for Sheikh Mubarak went out on Saturday after noon to see to some alterations that he is having executed on his new steam yacht and I borrowed horses from the Sheikh for myself and my wife and, on our arrival at Shweikh, we put off in a small boat and were shown over the yacht by the Sheikh ; We all returned together to the shore and walked a few yards westward, until we reached the rocks of which I have made meution in previous despatches and there discussed the proposal. 3. The Sheikh had frequently told me that the Germans had attempted to treat with him for this boat harbour and for Kathama point; but he added a touch that was new to me, for he said that, when the Germans found themselves at the end of their patience, they said that “ the Sultan has given us this and we will seize it.” 4. The Sheikh expressed a preference for having the measurement in thara’as of which approximately two go to the English yard. I asked that the length measurement should be along high water line six hundred thara’as and back from that two hundred thara’as and that as regards the sea portion of the con cession that all the coast line in front of our six hundred thara’as to the depth of one at the lowest tides should be included therein. 5. The Sheikh made no objection to all this but, as he made no mention of any price, I considered that enough had been done for one day and left that for further discussion. 6. It will be clear from all the above that the Sheikh will not let the land go tor a song but if he should propose anything which is out of all proportion to the estimate of the launch, I shall point out to him that Government is (v) hardly lilcely to pay, say, Rs. 75,000 for the sake of a wharf for a launch worth Rs. 50,000 and suggest that he ask the large price and double length and breadth of the concession and grant to a depth of two fathoms at lowest tides, when I shall be ready to place his proposal before you for consideration. 7. As far as I may venture to judge from the Sheikh’s attitude during our negociations he is really anxious to complete the bargain, whether on account of the large price he expects he will be able to exact for the concession or, taking a larger view, in the hope of binding the English closer to his interests. He has shown, by recent questions, that he is watching the Baghdad Railway closely and remarked, with evident dissatisfaction, that, so far, it appears to be wholly in German hands. A favourite saying of his is that whatever Power holds the line from Baghdad to the sea, that Power will undoubtedly hold all the Arabs and that the Arabs cannot resist such a Power. No. 56, dated the 27th January 1907. From— Major S. G. Knox, I.A., Political Agent, Koweit, To— Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political -Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to invite a reference to the correspondence ending with my letter No. 37 (Confidential), dated Koweit, the 21st January 1907, on the subject of the acquisition of a landing place at Shweikh harbour. 2. To-day I obtained an interview with Sheikh Mubarak and, after the usual preliminary greetings and coffee, I asked him to let me know what were his wishes as regards the land for which I had asked a concession from him on the 20th instant, 3. The Sheikh began a long and evidently careful considered reply. He began by saying that Arab Chiefs, his neighbours—he specially named Bahreini and Muskat—had large and flourishing properties which, if managed carefully and intelligently, would assure them large returns, whereas he had very little revenue to draw on, merely, so he said, his Customs dues which did not brin 01 him in half enough to live on suitably. I naturally did not allude to his Eao date gardens which would have led him into a dissertation on the Turks and their ways and the lack of support he receives from the British Goverument. He pointed out that, as I knew, the duties that hospitality to Arabs and the poor and guests imposed upon him were costly and, owing to his increased prestige, continually increasing. He emphasized the fact that he had been asked by the Germans to give them these lands that we now asked for and that he had refused them ; that a Russian Consul had pressed him to allow him to rent a house or grant a piece of land on which to build and that he had steadily refused, until, so he said, the Russian got angry with him. He referred to his*. agreement with the British Government and impressed upon me that, under that agreement, he was debarred from granting or leasing ground belonging to him to any foreigner. 4. He then said that he had received some assurance from His Excellency the late Viceroy, Lord Ourzon, when be visited Kovveit, that he would endea vour to obtain some allowance for him, but explained that, later, His' Excellency gave up the reins o ff office and nothing came of it. I did no consider myself justified in making any comment on this assertion and imagine that the Sheikh must h ive alluded to the incident when a sword o honour was presented to him and he made a somewhat ambiguous query asking what went with the sword. I would ask indulgence for the vagueness of this last explanation, as I write from memory of papers seen by me in the Bushire \ confidential record office and relating to His Excellency’s visit to the Gulf. 5. The Sheikh proceeded to say that land was increasing in value and that his subjects had endeavoured to procure concessions at both Shweikh and Kathama point in the hope that the railway would some day come and make the land valuable; that he was anxious to assist the British Goverument in every way but that he did not like to name any price for the land, that he threw himself on the liberality of Government and merely asked that they would give him something substantial to assist him in meeting his expenditure, which was beginning to be too large for him to cope with. He would prefer F i1 j 4 a yearly lease (quit-rent) but would not stand in the way of Government, if they attached great impartance to an out and out purchase. This last explana tion was in reply to a question I threw in. 6. The Sheikh gave me clearly to understand that what he was looking for was much more in the nature of a subsidy than an actual lease of the ground in question. He also made a personal appeal to me, remarking that he regarded me as a brother and that we had drunk coffee together for some years now and that he looked to me to show a tender regard for his interests. I replied that he might rely on my doing the best I could in his intere.sts compa tible with my duty towards Government and that no one realised more than myself how impossible it was for my work to progress, unless I worked in harmony with him, I trust that it will be clear that I do not note this part of our interview in any wish to exalt the notion of my influence with the Sheikh. I have been long enough now with Arabs to rate such expressions at their proper value. I venture to think that it show-; the absence of any pressure put on the Sheikh and that he is, at least, as anxious to sell the concession for a good price, as, so far as my limited purview can presume, the British Govern ment is to obtain it. 7. I went on to say that it was clear that the project had passed some way beyond my capacity to deal with it. The original plan was to make a landing place, fora launch worth some Us. 50,000, and that I had reckoned on spending some Ks. 10, 000 on the entire place of which a good deal more than half would have been swallowed up in the pier, coal-shed and quarters. It was evident, however, that the Sneikh wanted something substantial and he would under stand that, in that case, Government also would require a substantial return. I must therefore ask the Sheikh to double the length and breadth of the conces sion and to allow us full liberty to a depth of three fat'ioms at the lowest tides ; that we should choose the ground where we pleased subject to the proviso that the rocks already mentioned in previous correspondence should form part of the concession. I also explained that the sea-front line of the concession would not follow the high water line which would leave us at the mercy of every inlet but that a stick would be planted on the high water line atone end and a line 1,200 thara’ as long would be stretched to another stick also on the hig h water line and these would form the limits of the concession. 8. The Sheikh expressed his willingness to accept all, or any of these conditions but would not be induced to name what he would consider a suitable return for the land. He invariably replied that he trusted to the liberality of the Government and allu led to the friendly relations so fortunately established for many years between Koweit and the British. He referred to an incident of 4&lt;0 years ago and the assistance given by the Sheikh of Koweit and his boats to an old man-of-war called the Firoz for which it appears presents were sent by the Government of Bombay to the Sheikh of Koweit in reward for his exertions on that occasion. 9. This report will perhaps not be complete without some suggestion as to what price would be acceptable to the Sheikh. From the course the negociations have taken up to the present, I regret to state that it seems most probable that, to be successful, it must follow the leisurely dignified progress of an oriental bargain and we must expect to be raised. I have suggested to the Sheikh that it would simplify matters if the cost were calculated on the 1,200 thara’as of sea-front, the important part of the conces sion, and he appeared to accept this principle. The Sheikh evidently expects a large price and I would suggest that the first offer should be Rs. 2 per thara yearly quit-rent or half a lakh of rupees for an out and out purchase. I fear, however, that the purchase money will run to two lakhs down or Rs. 10,000 yearly quit-rent before the bargain is concluded and, in spite of the inconveniences of delay, I would suggest, with all deference, that an interval of at least three months be allowed to elapse before the subject is again alluded to at least on our part. 10. I would like to mention that, for the past four months, the Sheikh has kept me waiting for permission to conclude a bargain with a merchant, named shahin bin Ghamin, relating to the purchase of an enclosure which I v . . &lt;/ . require for camel stables. At the close of the interview, I made a brief allusion to this matter and he told me that Shahin would be sent to me to-morrow to conclude the sale and it will be some indication of the Sheikh’s anxiety to deal in the matter of Shweikh, if I am able to report, at an early date, the acquisi tion of Shahin’s enclosure. He will oblige me in the hope that I shall treat him well in my recommendations to Government. 11. It only remains to add that, throughout this interview, the Sheikh and I were alone until just towards the end when his eldest son, Sheikh Jabir, entered. Nothing of importance passed between us after his entrance, though Sheikh Jabir would be able to conclude that there was some matter of lease or sale to be discussed. He may of course, for all I know, be aware of the whole matter. G. X. C.P. 4481 jp. D.-22-3-07.-01. -J. E F.10th February,on the foreshore question ? From- Tftletram.

Foreign Secret. Your telegram of 26tli June. Koweit foreshore. Cox reported on 10th of February that Mubarak is willing to let us have a strip of foreshore wherever we like to select it, measuring six hundred yaids m length by one hundred in depth. This would give us best site in neighbour hood of Shweikh roadstead. Sheikh is willing to sell outright, but would prefer yearly quit rent. Knox suggests our first offer should be fifty thousand rupees as sale price, or two thousand four hundred rupees as quit lent in alternative. He anticipates, however, that Mubarak will probably demand very much more, as he is quite aware of potential value of land, and may run to demand two lakhs down, or ten thousand rupees quit rent. Cox thinks that we might offer up to fifteen thousand rupees annually, of which portion might be treated as subsidy. We are willing to pay ' p riC&lt; ? °i annual rent of foreshore subject to maximum of seven thousand eight hundred rupees, but would, of course, try to secure better terms Cox is being con sulted on probable attitude of Sheikh towards offer from British India Company to purchase, but our negotiations have been for direct sale or lease. We see no reason why Government of India should not conduct transaction direct. If purchase of launch for Political Agent were sanctioned this would probably facilitate conduct of negotiations, as this is reason hitherto assigned for acquisition of foreshore. * Group unintelligible. ? ‘ half.’ (J, fa Ax/i* nJjoF) From Secretary of State to Viceroy, Foreign Department, ZQth June 1907.

Captain Knox recommends that he be allowed first to endeavour to get Sheikh Mobarek to let him have for nothing, and enclose, a strip of the fore- shore in question 200 yards long by 50 yards deep. If he cannot get a free gift of it as waste ground he anticipates that he will be able to get it for Us. 1,000 hut recommends that he be given discretion to give anything the Sheikh may fix up to the ordinary market rate of five Dollars per zira, at which rate the price would, according to his calculation, work out at about Rs. 3,500. It would, I think, be preferable to pay for the ground and get the usual transfer document for it than to get the plot as a gift, perhaps to he repudiated by Sheikh Moharek’s successor, and I consequently recommend that the Political Agent be authorised to purchase as cheaply as he can within the limit of Us. 3,500 suggested by him. 3.

Sheikh Mubarak who has not yet made up his mind as to price, has expressed his readiness to grant a portion of tho foreshore. He stated, in discussing the with Captain Knox, that the trermans armed with the documents from the bultan had vainly endeavoured to acquire from him first Umkasr f then Kathama, finally Bunder bhwaikh. This looks as if he did not intend to sell too cheaply. Captain Knox suggests that his object may be to sell us the whole foreshore rather than a small portion in order that the vestment of interest thus acquired might oblige us to support him more strongly and to favour Koweit as the terminus of the railway, subject to any further instructions Captain Knox will continue negotiations quietly as opportunity offers as it is not advisable to hurry xiubarak over the negotiations.

Their Lordships* views are not wholly in accord with those of the Commander-in-Chief regarding the Hydrographic and Commercial considerations involved. Kurein Harbour, as shewn on Chart No.3571 possesses the following advantages.- (a) A wharf a mile in length, or a series of scalier wharves of that length, could be constructed with depths of not less than 25 feet alongside at low water. (b) A judicious arrangement of beacons would enable a vessel to use a channel to this wbarf of a depth of not less than 14 feet of water at low water springs, of 21 feet at high water neaps, and 24 feet at high water springs. (c* The depth in this channel it would not be difficult to increase to 20 feet at low water springs, and it is possible even greater depth could be obtained at some cost. (d) The berths alongside the wharf would be perfectly secure at all times. The Under Secretary of State, INDIA OFFICE, (e)o (e) A railway could run down to the wharf, and passengers or goods be embarked or disembarked without delay. A rough idea of what is meant is shewn on the attached cutting from ciBrt No.&amp;571. 8 .- With regard to Kathama it is to be observed - (a) That a depth of 20 feet at low water is about $ mile or upwards from the shore. (b) That it would be a much more expensive work to construct a wharf, alongside which vessels could moor, at Kathama than at Kurein. (O) There would be however plenty of room for vessels to anchor in an area of 30 feet depth and upwards at low water, about a mile off shore. 4. - The whole tendency of traffic in the present day is to bring vessels alongside wharves, or into floating docks, with railway communication alongside; so that trans-shipment to small vessels, lighters, or boats, is avoided, and it is especially necessary to study the convenience of passengers. 5. - The question of the expense of fitting a terminal portfof traffic is small in comparison with^the expense of a railway, and the advantage of a railway is greatly reduced if a convenient terminal port cannot be constructed. Such a convenient terminal port could be made at Kurein at probably a very much less cost than at Kathama. 6 . - In placing the above considerations before the Secretary of State, My Lords do not wish it to be understood that they advocate the construction of a harbour either at Kurein or Kathama, at the present moment. This- • __——__ —— 2^7 UT AH. ^ 6Ut This is a question of policy which involves much wider issues. As however the subject is engaging the attention of the Government of India Mr Morley may think it desirable that they should be in possession of the facts set forth above which are material to a full consideration of the question.

I \orp &lt; \ AuO • i Ho.1462.YI. i Sir, L DE.P^ I hare the honour to suhnit the following remarks on the inner harbour at Eorein justjto the South West of Eov/eit, for the information of His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor General in Council. I did not refer to this matter in my recent report on the Persian Gulf, Ho. 1462. 11.H. of the 26th April 1906, as I did not attach much importance to it, but in view of the opinion expressed in paragraph 25 of Confidential Hemorandum of information regarding external affairs in the Persian Gulf for the month of Harch last, by the Captain of the R.I.1I.S. 'Investigator”, 'that the anchorage in question is the real 'harbour of Koweit and that the adjacent foreshore would be the 'proper site for a railway station, should a railway ever come to Koweit', I feel bound to represent that I do not concur in this i: v! 1 I] opinion for the reasons stated hereafter. 2. The deep water anchorage off Eurein is shewn in our old' admiralty chart, but the recent survey by the 'Investigator' has increased our knowledge very greatly, and has therefore drawn attention to it.\ narrow stretoh of deep water and good anchorage carrying an average depth of about 25 feet for a length of about one mile (2000 yards) and of about 21 - 22 feet for a further distance of three cables (600 yards), the width of the anchorage between the three fathom lines in nowhere more than ?■£ cables (500 yards) and is more generally only 2 cables {400 yards), and to enter this anchorage there is nolfmore than 13 feet at low water, and that only in a very narrow channel, and 23 feet at high water springs, and this channel is nearly a mile (1800 yards)long. 4. Bearing these facts in m5n&amp;, and that a railway from Baghdad to Eoweit, or any other deep water terminus in the Persian Gulf, would only be practicable as a commercial trans action if there was a vastly increased amount of produce to be dzc disposed of, and/ v this could only be the result of a gigantic scheme of irrigation, and further considering that if this vast increase of produce should become a fact, snail steamers would he of no use to remove it, the whole tendency of the time being to run large vessels which are much more economical cargo carriers than small ones, I therefore think it very improbable that the Kunein anchorage would be selected, entailing, as it would, very expensive dredging, the oost of which could not be estimated until careful borings had been made, and the resultTassels. 3. Under these oironnstances, and considering that there is a at all times, and that this deep water is only one mile from the shore, I do not think we need consider Kurein as a probable site for the terminus of the railway. Ho doubt it is very con venient to the town of Koweit, and the Sheikh would therefore probably favour it, and it is of course a possible port for the railway, should it ever become an accomplished fact. 6. The Kurein position is an excellent one for a boat harbour and also for a vessel of war to anchor and support the defence o^ Koweit in an attack from the desert, as the 'Perseus” class could enter a little before high water, but even a second class cruiser, such as the 'Hermes”, is debarred from anchoring there, her ordinary draft of water - 23’ . 6' - being too great, even at high water springs, for her to enter without grave risk.4)5 In any further communica- tion on this subject, please quote ^ xv\ No. and address— The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, London. */ A' i i- 1 - 5 FEB i906 !r.

With reference to the correspondence accompanying your despatch No. 52 Confidential of the 25th ultimo I 25oT venture to observe that while I consider there is no ob jection to providing a steam launch for the Political agent at Koweit. the concurrent establishment of a coal depot and especially the erection of a flag staff will probably be reported here by the Vali of Basra as signs of territorial occupation which may give rise to unnec essary suspicions and possibly to some trouble in view of the better relations now existing between the Vail ctnd the Sheikh whose policy seems to be not to compro mise himself hopelessly with the Turks. We can adopt these measures by degrees but I think it would be advis able to proceed carefully and at first to be content with building quarters for the boat's crew. The rest will gradually follow.

Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to forward, for the consideration of the Government of India, a copy of a communication addressed No. 161, dated 6th November 1905. ^ me ^ ^ p ol i tical Agent at Koweit, in which he (1) asks that he may be supplied with a steam launch; and (2) recommends the purchase from Sheikh Mubarak of a certain piece of foreshore in connection with the housing of the launch and on other grounds. 2. As regards the launch, I quite agree with Captain Knox that it is a desideratum, and trust that the Government of India will he pleased to entertain the proposal. The second matter, that of the convenient deep-water anchorage, was discussed by me with Captain Heming of the K. 1. M. S. “ Investigator' on his arrival here a few weeks ago, and as the existence of this anchorage sremed to affect the question of the location of the projected Agency buildings for Koweit, I reserved it for discussion in that connection with Captain Knox on his arrival. This I did en route from Mohammerah a few days ago, and have addressed Government separately on the subject in this office letter No. 526 of to-day’s date. 3. The piece of foreshore in question may be regarded as part of Bunder- es-Shwaik, the 4th alternative site for the terminus of the projected railway mentioned in the recent report of Captain E. W. Mahon, It.E., for the inform ation of the Defence Committee. I have little doubt therefore that the Government of India will generally concur as to the prudence and innocuous- ness of our acquiring rights over it, if that end can be achie\ed without attracting attention, and I accordingly commend the subject to their wise consideration. 4. As suggesting a temporary or preliminary alternative to that recom mended by the°Political Agent, I venture to revert to the correspondence (end- in 0, with Eoreign Department endorsement No. 3721 E.-B., dated 4th October 1905) regarding the acquisition of coaling facilities at Koweit by the British India Steam Navigation Company. It will be remembered that Sheikh Mubarak expressed his readiness to give the Company the desired accom modation and facilities. We might perhaps pursue that subject with the Sheikh and get the British India Steam Navigation Company to deposit a few hundred tons of coal at the spot in question as soon as practicable. Ibis should be done by dhows from the present anchorage, so as not to make it evident to the public sooner than need be that steamers can approach close to the shore at the spot selected. The Political Agent could then say to the Sheikh that Government had provided him with a launch, and that he wanted to keep it near the British India Coal Store, in order to have facility for supplying her with coal. ) No. 161, dated the 6th November 1905. From— Captain S. G. Knox, I,A.., Political Agent at Koweit, To— Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. .4'. 4 I have the honour to invite your attention to the Preliminary Chart (Confidential) of the Port of Koweit prepared by Captain Heming, B.N., of the It. I. M. S. “Investigator”. 2. The issue of this chart and conversation with Captain Heming have decided me in making a formal application for the supply of a launch to this Agency to enable the Political Agent to visit any portion of the coast line under his charge and adjacent islands of Eaylaka and Bubiyan. The provision of a launch would also expedite the despatch of mails to the British India steamers, which always require to leave this port without delay.2 3. During the whole time I have been at Koweit, the want of a launch has made itself felt, but the difficulty of harbouring the vessel has hitherto prevented me from applying for one. . 4. The information, supplied by the new chart shows that this difficulty is purely imaginary. In front of the line of rocks adjacent to the words “ overflow at H. W. Springs”, point B (5 infra), and directly east of the harbour of Shwaik, there is excellent deep water, thoroughly protected from all the prevalent winds of Koweit. 5. Captain Heming in a report to the Director, Royal Indian Marine, No. 126, dated Maskat, 26th April 1905, of which he has kindly permitted me to take a copy, has made the following remarks on the subject of this anchorage. I proceed to quote in extenso. “ Paragraph 6. An examination of the accompanying tracing will show the existence of a well-sheltered harbour, two to three miles south-west of Koweit, where boats could always lie and, if a small pier were erected at the spot marked B, cargo could be landed in all weathers; it would be as easy to get from and to B to anchorage C as from A during a shamal, but the extra distance in calms or contrary winds would be a drawback, as would also be the transport from B to A, after the goods were first landed. I should like to point out the capabilities of the western harbour; it wall be noticed from the tracing that there is a considerable area having a depth of from 25 to 30 feet within a very short distance from the shore, from wdiich con venient piers could be run out. Prom this deep water, a narrow gut trends towards the anchorage C, but is barred from it by a ridge of shoal surroundings, 400 yards broad, carrying 12 to 13 feet at low water spring tides, marked I on tracing). The Marine Survey registered night and day tides from 11th to 30th March, inclusive, during which the highest high-water recorded above the datum to which the surroundings were reduced was 11 feet 7 inches, and the lowest 6 feet 8 inches. Note. —Captain Heming ha* kindly also favoured me with a spare copy of the Ppreliminary Chart on which he has marked the points A, B, and C referred to above. It is being forwarded to you under separate cover. If the report and tracing are, as is probable, available for reference, I shall be greatly obliged if this copy of the chart could be returned to me. S. G-. Knox. Prom this it may he inferred that ships of 22 feet draught could enter the western harbour at springs and from 17 to 18 feet draught at all times of high water. The passage in could be made excessively easy by means of transit marks at no great expense. The close proximity of the deep water to the shore and the sheltered nature of the anchorage would make it invaluable as a coaling station for ships of moderate draught. I fear the cost of deepening the bar would be prohibitive, as the hottom is probably rock, though, judo-in' froip the outcrop op shore, I should infer not very solid. Native divers were sent down, but beyond saying that the bottom was hard, they were of little use. Probing with a soft iron rod was then resorted to, but it would not penetrate apd, in every case, met with sufficient resistance to turn the point of the rod ”. r 6. The extreme importance of this anchorage and the land immediately adjoining at once becomes eveident, and I would ask that I may be favoured with sanction to enter into negotiations with Sheikh Mubarak for as much of the foreshore as he will part with to be bought outright by Government for the fair market rate per zira. 7. The provision of a launch, erection of a landing jetty, signal staff, coal-shed, and quarters for the crew, of whom four at least would he~ natives of India, wouk 7 afford me a reasonable excuse for making this purchase of a con siderable plot of land, the importance of which does not terminate by any means with the provision of a launch for the Political Agent, Koweit In j Captain Heming’s view this is the harbour of Koweit and the proper site for a railway station, should a railway ever come to Koweit. It would, I submit be a great political advantage to have a solid title to the most valuable site in Koweit which now lies desolate and apparently valueless.8 . To retarn to the details of the launch, i wouiu propose that a launch 60 feet long, drawing not more than 6 feet of water, carrying sufficient coal for a vova°*e of 100 miles (50 miles there and 50 hack) he provided. The launch should be fitted with a distiller to provide water for steaming the launch and drinking water for the crew. Tanks should be fitted to hold a sufficient quantity of reserved distilled water to enable the boiler to be refilled after cleaning internally. The necessity for the distiller is due to the difficulty and expense of procuring a supply of good water at Koweit, and especially at Shwaik, two to three miles further off. 9 . The first desideratum, after the purchase of the ground and before even the launch was provided, would be the erection of a coal-shed to allow storage room for 150 tons coal or a quarter’s supply. Tor this a shed inside measurements 35 ' X 2 o' x 10 'high would suffice. The walls should be two feet thick with an iron gate in the centre of the north wall, faced by a strong iron grating window in the south wall; both would need to be protected by shelters from rain beating in and injuring the coal. The building would have to be constructed on a plinth of two feet above the level of the ground. Corrugated iron sheeting suggests itself as the most effective material for roof and shelters. This and the gate and barred window should, I think, come from India, but the plinth and walls could be constructed here locally from dead coral stone and juss at a cost of Its. 1,200. 10 . With regard to the remaining buildings, I hope that the supply of a launch would greatly reduce the cost of carriage of materials, and I have therefore not attempted to form any estimates for the present. 11 . Should these proposals meet with your approval, I would ask that estimates for the coal-shed might be asked for from the Public Works Depart ment in India, so that the work may be taken in 1 and without delay, as soon as the purchase of the ground has been arranged for, and the supply of a launch sanctioned.
