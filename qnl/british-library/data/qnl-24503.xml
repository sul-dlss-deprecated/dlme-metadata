There is no doubt that the tribe has received a severe lesson, m proo of which may be noted the fact that the road through the Tangistan district, which had been closed to caravans for some time past owing to the lawlessness of the tribe, k 33 Xv'Tong this more tranquil condition of affairs will last, it is difficult to say. With a 0 weak Governor of Bushire (the tribesmen now have a wholesome dread of the Darya Begi), trouble is at any time possible, i hanks to the efforts of certain merchants of Bashire, who have imported arms of recent yeais in such lar^e quantities, the tribesmen in the vicinity are all well armed and are quite capable of mischief, should a suitable occasion oiler. ^ I can bear personal testimony to the extent to which the population of this part of 1 ersia has become armed with breech-loading rifles of recent years, ien yeais ag 0 » a Martini-Henry rifle was rarely seen. Now, even in the town of Bushire itseii armed men are constantly seen, and in the adjacent villages there can hardly* be a man who does not possess a Martini-Henry rifle. Fuhlic Health.—The past year has been a healthy one in Bushire. The Bummer, though long, was comparatively mild, and no epidemic or contagious disease occurred during the year.. Telegraphic information was received about the middle of April that plague had broken out in the Ardelan province, north of Kermanshah, near the Turkish frontier, and caused some 200 deaths. The Turks, therefore, imposed quarantine on arrivals from Persia. Small-pox of a severe type appeared at Shargah in the first week of April, causing, it was reported, about 500 deaths. Early in May reports were received from Bandar Abbas that an abnormal death-rate prevailed on the island of Kishm, and the Assistant Surgeon on duty at Bandar Abbas, in connection with the plague preventive operations, visited the island and reported the outbreak of plague. The disease, however, soon disappeared. The Residency Surgeon visited the island early in June to supervise the opera tions undertaken to prevent the spread of the disease. The Residency Surgeon was in charge of the sanitary arrangements in the Persian Gulf throughout the year, but the financial control, whioh had hitherto been in the hands of the local Persian authorities, was transferred to the^ Belgian Director-General of Customs in Southern Persia. This arrangement has proved satisfactory, as arrears of payments due in connection with the expenditure on plague preventive operations have been paid up, and there is no longer any difficulty in obtaining payment on account of current expenses^ Hie buildings on the quarantine island have been put in good order, and furniture provided for the house set apart for first and second cliss passengers.. The fees recovered from passengers have been raised, and now amount to Rs, 5 for first-class, Rs. 4 for second-class, and Rs. 3^ for third-class passengers. tv * -—No appreciable improvement has taken place in the currency. le Bijecks, however, referred to in the last year's report, have been entirely suppiessed, and the new kran coinage is more available than heretofore. supp y of new nickel coins, minted in Belgium^ has been imported to augment the current copper coinage £s;P~S''~'hesidency and maskat political agency for the year 1900-1901. 3 Administration of the Customs in the Fersian Gulf. —On the 21st March 1900 the control of the Customs was, as stated in last year's report, taken under the direct management of the Persian Government. 'M. Simais, formerly Commercial Attache of the Belgian Legation at Tehran, arrived in Bashire and took up his appointment as Director-General of the Customs of Ears J ' , acting under the orders of M. Naus, the Belgian Minister of Customs at Tehran. Other Belgian officials arrived, and the administration of the Customs at Bushire, Lingah and Bandar Abbas was formally assumed. As was only to be expected, the new administration, which interfered with so many vested interests, experienced at the outset considerable opposition. At first it was intended to impose a uniform import duty of 5 per cent, ad valorem on all goods imported into Persia by the native merchants instead of the hitherto prevail ing specific rates. This proposal, however, was stoutly opposed, and the native merchants of Bushire and Shiraz refused to clear their goods from the Customs House. Eor a month or more business was entirely suspended, and goods imported remained uncleared. Both in Bushire and Shiraz the excite ment was considerable, and it was feared that serious disturbances would occur. The Persian Government, therefore, decided to introduce a new tariff on a sliding scale, which would be more favourable to the native merchants than the proposed 5 per cent. rate. This tariff was also opposed, but the Persian Govern ment remained firm, and by the first week in August the new tariff came in force. Since then matters have progressed smoothly, and at the time of writing this report the Customs Administration have succeeded in bringing into force the 5 per cent, rate for all native-owned goods. Native merchants and foreign ers are now, therefore, on the same footing as regards the payment of duty. So far as the interests of European merchants are concerned, the establish ment of the Belgian Customs Administration at the Gulf Ports has been, I believe, entirely beneficial, and various improvements have been effected. In course of time, under the present able and energetic management of M. Simais, many other desirable improvements will undoubtedly be effected. The orders of the Persian Government against the importation of arms and ammunition are now being energetically carried out. At the smaller ports, however, where the new administration has not as yet been able to assume control, the smug gling of arms still continues. It is said, however, that the Persian Govern ment are considering the question of purchasing two small gunboats for the purpose of patrolling the coast of the Persian Gulf with a view to put a stop to the smuggling. M. Simais tells me that he has seized and confiscated more than 1,000 rifles and 200,000 rounds of ammunition during the year. Prom the point of view of the Persian Government, the new system of Customs management has resulted in a large increase of revenue. From a return, which the Director-General was good enough to give me, his adminis tration in the Gulf has succeeded in bringing in an income of 3,947,000 krans, a considerable increase over the sum of krans 2,400,000 for which the Customs were formerly farmed. When it is considered that for about two months at the beginning of the year business was practically at a standstill, owin^ to the opposition which the new administration experienced, that the trade of Bandar Abbas has shown a great falling off, and that there are several minor ports where the Belgians have not yet succeeded in establishing their control, it will be understood how profitable, from the point of view of increased revenue, the new system is likely to prove. Settlement of Claims for Compensation. —During the past year the long outstanding claim of Messrs. David Sasson &amp; Co., amounting to tomans 6,053, on account of goods missing from the Customs House in Bushire, has been settled, as also the claim of Messrs. Lynch Brothers for tomans 600 on account of robbery of specie. His Imperial Majesty the Shah has decided to send a special delegate to Bushire to inquire into the numerous claims of British subjects against the Persian Government. The delegate has not yet arrived, but is expected shortly. Demise of Her late Majesty Queen-Empress Victoria. —The melancholy news of the demise of Her Most Gracious Majesty Queen-Empress Victoria was received in Bushire with universal sorrow.

ThAThief of Abu Dhabi was away in the interior, but I saw his son and other ■noiml men In January, I visited Mohammerah and made the acquaint- !mPP of Shaikh Khazal. Later in the year I visited Maskat and the principal Persian Gulf ports. Mr. W. S. Davis, my First Assistant, paid a visit to Shiraz in June, returning to Bushire in October. Captain P. Z. Cos was Political Agent throughout the year. His relations with the Sultan have been most cordial. l the Sultan nave oeen uuiuuu rr. nr • * &gt; n A satisfactory issue to the negotiations between His Jlajesty s Government and that of the French Republic regarding the site of the French coal shed ia the Maskat harbour has been arrived at, a portion of the site hitherto used by us for the storage of coal having been made over to the French. The plague epidemic, to which reference was made in last year's report, died out entirely in the beginning of May, and there has been no recrudes cences. The Political Agent's report of the principal events in the Maskat State during the year forms Part II of this compilation. In May 1900 the Chief of Abu Dthabi repeated his request for permission to send provisions by sea to the Sudan tribe under Sultan-bin-Nasir, to whom he had accorded his protection, and who wished to colonize Zaora, a place in close proximity to the territories of the Chiefs of Ajman and Shargah. As this permission had been previously granted, though not hitherto taken advan tage of, and as it was understood that the Chiefs of Shargah and Ajman, who. claimed the ownership of Zaora, had no objection to its occupation by the Sudan tribe, the Resident gave the required permission. Later on, however, it appeared that the Chiefs of Shargah and Ajman strongly objected to the appearance of the Chief of Abu Dthabi at a place so close to their territory, and as it appeared possible that the permission granted to Shaikh Zaid might be the cause of disturbances, the permission granted to the Chief of Abu Dthabi was revoked, and he was advised to give up his project with regard to Zaora. On the 8th July 1900, Abdul Aziz, the uncle of Shaikh Humaid-bin- Rashed, Chief of Ajman, attacked Ajman, and Shaikh Humaid having been killed, Abdul Aziz assumed charge of the government of the place. Shaikh Humaid-bin-Abdulla, Chief of Ras-al-Khaima, died at an advanced age on the 2nd August 1900, and the government of the place was assumed by the Chief of Shargah, who now rales both Shargah and Ras-al-Khaima. So lar his authority has not been disputed by the other claimants to the Chiefship« The Resident, in the interests of the general peace, found it necessary to intervene in the dispute mentioned in last year's report regarding the pearl of great value. An amicable settlement was arrived at,, the claim of the Sultan of Maskat to a share in the value of the pearl being admitted. It is hoped that the settlement will shortly be, if it has not already been, carried into effects The pearling season along the Arab Coast has not been at all a satisfactory one. iSo cases of piracy or disturbances at sea occurred during the year. Mi. Gaskin has been confirmed in the appointment of Assistant Political Agent and has remained at Bahrein throughout the year.

The murder took place on the main land, where the murdered Shaikh with his followers had gone, in accordance with his usual custom at this time of year, on a huntino- expedition. The incident was a cause of great concern 'to the Chief of Bahrein, It is too early yet to write the history of the struggle which has been in 5. Koweit and progress during the past few months between Shaikh Mubarak and the Amir Nejd - of Nejd, and which has thrown this part of Arabia into turmoil. At one time it seemed not improbable that fortune would favour Shaikh Mubarak, and that he would succeed in reinstating in Nejd Abdul Rah mac -bin-Fey sal, of the Saud dynesty, the former rulers of the country. Up till the middle of March no fighting of any importance had taken place, though it was known that Shaikh Mubarak had made his way far into the interior. Towards the end of March, however, reports reached Bushire that Shaikh Mubarak had experienced a decisive defeat. Details are not yet forthcoming. I visited Koweit on two occasions during the year, and I had an interview with Shaikh Mubarak on the first occasion. At the time of my second visit he was absent from Koweit. H.M.S. Sphinx has also visited the place. From reports which have reached the Kesidency, affairs in Persian 8. Persian Arabistan appear to have been quiet during the year. His Boyal Highness the Arabistazi * Ain-ud-Dowleh, who was Governor-General, proceeded to Tehran about the end of December to spend ' Bamazan ' there. He has since been appointed Governor of Tehran, and is succeeded by His Royal Highness Salar -ed-Dowleh as Governor-General of Arabistan, Luristan, eto. Towards the end of May, the Bakhtyaris were building the Dupalan bridge on the Ispahan road, and three Ispahan Kafilas had arrived at Ahwaz with almonds and dried fruits for sale, and purchased goods for the return journey. More caravans were said to be on the way, and a number of pil 'Tims for Meshed travelled by the new route early in June. His Royal Highness the Moayid-ud-Dowleh was Governor-General of Fars 7. fpt-s and during the year. The Kowam-ul-Mulk appears to have maintained fairly ''ood Persian Coast, order among the Nomad tribes. Nothing of particular interest occurred at Lingah during the year. At Bandar Abbas, Lieutenant Hunt remained as British Vice-Consul daring the year. Trade at this port has greatly declined during the year, the reasons given being that the new trade route from Quetta via Nushki and Seistan has diverted a good deal of the trade which used to find its way to Bandar Abbas, and also that Russian imports into Khorassan have increased. Shaikh Hassan, the Zabit of Kishm, has been removed and was succeeded bv Shaikh Abdulla. Mr. AA hitby-Smith, Director, Persian Gulf Telegraphs, who is in nolitical s, Persian charge of the Makran Coast, visited the Coast in November last. It had been BaluchistaD &lt; arranged through Major Sykes, His Britannic Majesty's Consul at Kerman, that a Persian official should meet him at Charbar to inquire into, and, if possible, effect a settlement of the numerous outstanding claims of British subjects. The official left Kerman, but did not go any farther than Bampur, whence ke returned to Kerman. Iwelve slaves took refuge in the Bushire Residency during the year, and 9. Slave were, after the customary correspondence with the Persian anthorities, granted Trade - their freedom. Three of them were, at their own request, sent to Zanzibar^ and the remainder stayed in Bushire where they were able to find employment. Three piratical outrages took place within the Gulf during the year, only 10. Piracies one of which was of a really serious nature, a Bahrein boat which was engaged and di3 ^ ur p !3 ' in pearl-fishing off Ras Tanura, near Katif,. being attacked by robbers from anCeS a S Darain in Turkish territory, and property of the value of Rs. 3,924 being carried off. The case was reported t to the Turkish authorities, who arrested some of the robbers and obtained the restoration of a portion of the stolen property.ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF EO LITICAL 11, Navy. 12, Omcial changes. — ~ 7' i i ^fF Pl-Wakra between some boats of the Al-bin- A disturbance took i n pearl-fishing and were driven Ali and Amaraera tribcs y ^ Luckily the disturbance bad no by a storm to take she! f ,, ]; cv 0 f the Britisb Government, wbich serious A'' l o(! curren ee of any disturbances_ at sea, the case was 3' t'E°lUlT r X i inquiry, MM » MM . «' «« tbe tribe wbicb was held to i yio-ilant watch kept bv the Moez-es- During the ^ t presence of one of His Sultan eh, the Sbaik i o Ab ' of p j racy was reported, thougn, Majesty's sh.ps m the Shatt el Ara^n^^ ^ Babr ^ n boat was attacked near M^mer on tbTTurkish side of tbe river.'

Of Foreign Navies, the French store ship, the was the only ship which entered'the Gulf during the year. She called at Bandar Abbas, Lmgah and Busbire, and also visited Koweit, Mohammerah and Basrah. Lieutenant-Colonel M. J. Meade proceeded to Bombay in the R.I.M.S. Lawrence on furlough and made over charge of his post as Political liesident, Persian Gulf at Bombay, on 7tb April 1900, to Lieutenant-Colonel 0 A. Kemball, who arrived at Bushire in the Lawrence on 26ili April, and held the post of Resident for the remainder of the year. &lt; &gt; Mr. Davis was First Assistant throughout the year, and visited Shiraz during the summer months, leaving Bushire on 10th June and returning on 23rd October. Captain *E. 'Wickham Hore, I.M.S., was Eesidency Surgeon during the year. He went on three months'privilege leave to India on 10th July, and rejoined his post on 13th October. During his absence, Assistant Surgeon J. A. Lobo, I.S.M.D., acted as Residency Surgeon. Mr. J. P. Sequeira returned from furlough on the 14th November, and Mr. Gaskin having been posted to Bahrein, assumed charge of the post of Extra Assistant to the Political Resident and Yice-Consul. During Mr. Gaskin's absence and until the arrival of Mr. Sequeira, Mr. P. J. Gandhy was acting Uncovenanted Assistant and Vice-Consul, alter which he was appointed Superintendent of the Residency Office. ia. Dr. Reinhardt, Imperial German Consul, held charge of the German Vice- r 111 resentati'^es Consulate in Bushire up to the 24th April, when he went on furlough, being Fr ' relieved by Herr Roesler, who remained in charge of the Vice-Consulate until March, when Dr. Reinhardt returned to Bushire.

The Mowalik, not unnaturally, prepared for imme diate retaliations but the matter was satisfactorily settled by the intervention of the Sultan and an adequate apology from the Shaikh of the Siabieen. Early in May news was received that Shaikh Xasir -bin-IIamed was mecli- tatino* mischief and had asked the Beni Ruwaheh to let him make use of their passes into the Simail valley. The latter, however, on behalf of the bultan, closed their roads against' Shaikh Nasir, who then attempted an attack on Nezwah, in which he signally failed, as the Sultan's Wali in that town was pre pared for him and put ins force to rout, recovering at the same time some ntty camels which had been looted by them. ^ ) * j • 4. Shaikh Khalfan-bin-Thenayan, who was referred to in last year s Admi nistration Report as having been re-appointed VTali of Nakhl by the Governor ot Simail on the latter's own authority and as having been reluctantly confirmed in that post by the Sultan, again became a source of trouble, in that, according to report, he incited some evilly disposed persons to kill a man of the Khumucl tribe in the precincts of tho town itself. On hearing of this the Sultan dis patched a party of AVahabis under the AVali of Burka to arrest this recalci trant ollioial and to bring him a prisoner to Maskat. The Shaikh againRESIDENCY AND MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1900-1901. 15 cleverly eluded the men sent to arrest him, and for some time remained in security; bein^, however, friendless and homeless, he was finally reduced to claiming sanctuary in the Sultan's palace and abjectly begging pardon for his past misdeeds. On the 12th of August a serious brawl took place in the bazar at the port of Seeb between the Eeni Haiyieh and the Awlad Hadeed ■which resulted in some loss of life. Fortunately, however, effective measures were taken before the disturbance gained any vserious proportions; howbeit the bazar was closed for some days by reason of it, and the contending parties continued to behave riotously when opportunity offered. In the absence of the Sultan in the interior, Saiyid Mahomed-bin-Turki, who was in charge of affairs at Maskat, on the receipt of the news at Seeb (which is but 20 odd miles from Maskat)j promptly despatched 50 Wahabis under Saiyid Badr-bin-Seif to put down the disturbance and make peace between the combatants. Mean while the news had also reached the Sultan at his camp in the Sirnail valley, and he hurriedly marched from thence to Seeb to settle the matter himself! A day or two later 13 of the ringleaders were sent into Maskat by him for incarceration. 5. In October Shaikh Isa-bin-Saleh-el-Harthi, son of the leader of the rebellion of 1895, in company with his brother Hamed and Shaikh Mohsin- bin-Amr, brother of Hilal-bin-Amr, arived at Simail ostensibly with the object of paying complimentary visits to the Shaikhs of the Beni Ruwaheh and Beni Jabar, but in reality to make overtures for the active support of these two tribes in the event of any move being made by the Sharkiya tribesmen against Maskat. The emissaries, however, signally failed in their errand and were not even able to secure a promise of neutrality, owing no doubt to the fortunate fact that the Sultan in his recent tour in the Simail valley had managed to win over to his allegiance Shaikh Saeed-bin-Abdulla, a powerful leader of the Beni Ruwaheh and son of the famous Kalili, who in 1869 assisted Azzan-bin-Kais to assume power in Maskat and thus break the line of succes sion of the descendants of the great Saiyid Sultan. Having failed in his object, Isa -bin-Saleh endeavoured to whitewash himself by addressing a letter to the Sultan through the Wali of Simail conveying his respects to His High ness, and asking permission to pay him a visit at Maskat. The Sultan, not believing in his professions of amity, sent him a civil reply, thanking him for his good intentions, but at the same time discouraging him from coming into Maskat at present. Shaikh Isa and his companions thereupon returned to their head-quarters in the Sharkiya. 6. In November Saiyid Saeed-bin-Ibrahim Kais took upon himself to dam the irrigation canals used to convey water to the date groves of the Ibrieen at Awabi, on account of the nonpayment by them of the Zakat' or land tax. The Temimeh of the Ibrieen thereupon assembled his tribesmen, and supported by 300 of them blockaded the fort of Awabi, then in the possession of Saeed- bin-Ibrahim, who at once applied to the Sultan for assistance in men and money to enable him to beat off his assailants. In response to his call the Sultan ordered Mahomed-bin-Hamed to proceed at once to Awabi and endeavour to bring the parties to a settlement without bloodshed. On arrival, however, Saiyid Mahomed found the garrison much pressed and the besiegers in no mood to come to terms. He reported to the Sultan accordingly with all despatch, and thereupon His Highness at once started for the Batineh in person, but on arrival at Seeb he met runners from the scene of action with letters for him to the effect that the Ibrieen had taken possession of the fort, the garrison having fled without a fight. The Ibrieen now offered to make over the fort to the Sultan or to hold it for him ; but the latter thought it wisest not to put faith in their promises, but to garrison it with Wahabis, which he accordingly did. 7. In December dissensions arose between the Beni Ryam and the Yemen of Zikki, the former being the aggressors. The reason for the collision proved to be that the Beni Ryam had attempted to build a new fort at Zikki, which would in fact give them control over the roads leading to that place and constitute a permanent menace to the members of the Yemen also residing there. Any alteration of the status quo was equally injurious to the interests of the Sultan also, and he accordingly addressed the Beni Ruwaheh and enjoined them to take the advice of the Wali and revert to the old order of things. A few days later he was gratified to receive from his Wali a letter reporting that he hadADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL Dhofar and Sohar. Sur.

During the year under report His Highness the Sultan moved about in his territorv, whether on long or short excursions, more frequently and to a greater extent than he has ever done in the past^and I am assured by natives with knowledge of what is passing in the interior that his increased energy m t us regard has resulted in some enhancement of the practical respect with which he^ is held in the interior. I am also of opinion that the ie&gt;toiation to the Vazirship of his old family retainer Saiyid Saeed -bin-Mahomed and the consequent benefit of the latter's experienced counsels have also tended not a little to improve His Hi^hness's position and relations with his subjects of the hinterland. In any case it is certain that he shows more inclination to leave his capital from time to time and move about among his subjects in the inte rior than has hitherto been his habit, and this can hardly tail to extend and strengthen his influence among them. 11. The Political Agent during the year visited the ports of the Batineh Coast, viz., S t 'eb, Burka, Suweik, Kkaboora, Sohar and Shenas, and to the south of Maskat, Kurryat and Sur. The communities of British Indian traders at those places seemed to be prospering and contented. There ere irdeed a few com plaints of the Sultan's TValis being unable or disinclined to enforce for them the payment of acknowledged debts by their Arab customers, to which the Sultan's attention was drawn, and there was the general complaint that Customs duty was levied in full from them while Arabs from the interior paid or not as they chose.

The Sultan is endeavouring to better the state of things in this respect, at all events at the larger ports, but the difficulty is one which has always existed and which only time and the gradual strengthening of the ruler s administration and influence will effectively eliminate. 12. Customs. —An interesting feature of the year under review has been the administration of the Customs by the Sultan's own arrangements. Prom time immemorial it had been the habit of the rulers of Maskat to sell annually to one of the Banian traders the right to collect ' Customs ' at Maskat and Muttra, and this individual practically became banker to the local Government for the current year. This was a convenient arrangement from some points of view, but on the expiry of the last contract His Highness, being in a prosperous financial position at the time, determined to try the experiment of levying the Customs dues himself, and it is satisfactory to know that after a complete year's experience he finds his revenue increased, after paying expenses, by about 20,000 dollars. Considering that this is the first year of a new organisation, the levy has been carried on with reasonable efficiency andPOLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE TBAE ISOO-IOOl- 17 consideration by tLc Sultan's Hindustani offipialc i,nf tu,, i that the Customs revenue of the port ttould still teach lii.-hei' ^Mi're'rit itk ''' q ' m ' d — °&lt; a— tor £ S'; ttr ', o Sl'to'th'!, tlle P artles ooooemedhare appearetftocl'aim iVe'bolmS • 4 f ear t di s P'(e.

There have been marked signs of improvement in trade both in imnort General and export during the year under review, owing to the gradual recoverv of thp Remarki country from the effects of the previous year's scarcity brought on by scanty Imports.- —The imports into Bushire improved to the extent of Rs 60 98 0^7 while those into Lingah declined by Rs. 16,52,855. The articles which chiefly contributed to increase Bushire imports are candles, cotton piece^oods dru^s and medicines^ yarn and twist, glass and glassware, gold lace and 'thread hardware, indigo, matches, metals, kerosine oil, porcelain and chinaware' loaf and soft sugar, woollen goods and specie. The items shewino'decrease in Lingah imports are dates, grain and pulse, pearls and specie. Exports. —The exports from Bushire improved by Rs. 27,14,846 under the heads of cotton, almonds, wheat, gum, opium, tobacco, carpets and specie while those from Lingah decreased by Rs. 12,26,800 under the heads of '■rain and pulse, pearls and specie. Harvest. —The grain crop of the year was abundant, but the prices did not fall to a sufficient extent to encourage exportations being undertaken on any large scale; and the shipments made to London by the leading British firms proving unremunerative, further operations in that direction were disconti nued. Fearl fishery. —The heavy decline both in the imports into, and exports from, Lingaji is due to the failure of the pearl fishery on the Arab Coast of the Gulf. The import of pearls declined by nearly eight lakhs of rupees, and the export by^ six and-a-half lakhs. The importance of Lingah as a commercial port is entirely dependent upon the prospects of the pearl fisheries on the Arab Coast, and any failure or success in these operations directly affects the interests of that port, as it is used as an entrepdt for trade operations all over the Arab Coast, and the product of the pearl fisheries is brought to it for exportation abroad. From various reports received from the Residency Agents at Lingah and on the Arab Coast, it was apprehended that the take during the year would be very ^ limited. The apprehension has been unfortunatelv realized, and the operations which were undertaken resulted in the output of pearls of very small sizes, unsuited to the requirements of the market abroad. Mr. Gaskin, the Assistant Political Agent, in his report on the Bahrein trade, mentions that one of the principal pearl banks to the north of the Bahrein Islands was found diseased, and that the pearl fishery there proved a failure. Gum Industry. —The new industry of gum is making rapid progress and may eventually become an important item in the export trade of the Gulf. Tragacanth is finding much favour in the United Kingdom and Germany, and America might also come in for a share. The industry, however, does not appear to be conducted with any foresight or method, and may suddenly die if the operations for collecting the exudations are not manipulated scientifically. A few years ago Tragacanth was quite unknown in Persia, and only the Kerman- shah district contributed towards the exportation of that item via Baghdad. It is now only three or four years that both Shiraz and Ispahan have come forward to contribute towards this trade. The industry in the province of Ears is said to be capable of great improvement, and vast tracts of land full of the Tragacanth-producing plant, which were lying untouched before, are being much utilized. From the reports which have been received, it appears that the peasantry employed in the collection of the Tragacanth work in a reckless manner, causing much damage to the plants, which are burnt down after incision to such an extent as to render the same field unproductive for some years to come. Though the Tragacanth fields are numerous and extensive, they will not be able to withstand the wholesale depredations which are now being perpe trated on them, unless the Persian Government undertakes their supervision with a view to maintaining and improving the industry.

Bushire shews an increase of Rs. 6,45,465, while Lingah s lews a decline of Rs. 2,78,480. India took the largest share of the specie exported from Bushire, viz., Ks. 8,21,150, thus improving the figures of last year by Ks. 4,74,905. Bahrein comes next with Ks. 3,12,000 as against Es. 7,3.)5 m the last year. The exports to both Turkey and Persian ports also show an increase of Ks. 22,275 and Ks. 1,230 respectively over the figures of previous year. United Kingdom this year took Ks. 46,500 from Bushire. ^ But Mask at took Ks. 4,050 less than last year, which explains the decrease in the export trade from Bushire to that country.

In the beginning of April the rate stood at krans 60, but towards the end of the month rose to krans 85, and continued at this figure till it fell to krans 47 in July. From July to the end of the year the average rate for 775 lb. was krans 80. It touched its highest point in January at krans 105, and its lowest in July at krans 47. Freight. —Freight ruled at 22s. Sd. per ton to London in the beginning of the year, when it advanced to 27s. 6(/. in February and 30s. in March, 'and remained stationary at that figure till July, when it fell to 27s. 6d. In October it again advanced to 30s., and continued at that figure till December, when it fell to 2os. and remained at this figure till the end of the year. Shipping. —The shipping returns shew that 193 steam vessels with a tonnage of 223,564 entered the ports of Bushire and Lingah and 157 with a tonnage of 177,941 cleared from them. They show an advance of 8 vessels of 10,648 tons and 32 vessels of 33,458 tons, respectively, as having entered and cleared Jrom the two ports over the figures of the previous year. Taken separately, the total number of steam vessels entering Bushire during the year under report was 113 with a tonnage of 135,564, an increase of 7 vessels and 9,548 tons as compared with 1899. The total number which cleared was 118 vessels of 135,041 tons burden—an iccrease of 26 vessels and 26,858 tons. The figures cf Lingah as regards entrance shew a slight increase of 1 vessel of 1,100 tons burden, and under the return of clearance there is an increase of 6 vessels of 6,600 tons. Out of the 193 steam vessels which entered the ports of Bushire and Lingah, 189 carried the British flag, 3 the Turkish flag, and the remaining 1 was an Austrian boat. Similarly, out of the 157 steam vessels which cleared from these two ports, 152 were under British, 2 under Austrian and 3 under Turkish colours. Custows, It is satisfactory to note that the establishment of the present Customs Administration since March last under European control has put a stop to the discreditable state of affairs mentioned in the trade report of 1898, when the goods landed at the Customs House in Bushire used to be at the mercy of unscrupulous native Customs officials, who helped themselves to other people's goods, in the majority of cases with impunity. Claims for compensa tion on account of goods missing from the Customs belonging to British sub jects have not yet all been settled, but the Persian Government are being ur^ed to effect a settlement. Confidence has now been restored amongst the mercantile community in respect of the custody of their merchandise under the present Customs Admin istration, which has promptly paid claims on account of any shortage proved to have occurred whilst goods were^ lying at the Customs House. But there are persons in Bushire who do not view the present Customs Administration with favour and who are sighing for the old regime. The reason of this is not far to seek. Undei the old administration, when the Customs used to be farmed by the Governor of the day, some of the principal merchants were in the habit of making private arrangements with the Governor, whereby they obtained con siderable reductions in the assessment of the Customs duty. But all that has now been changed, and the full 5 per cent, ad valorem duty is charged by the present administration. It will therefore take some time before the people realize the benefits of a properly organized administration of Customs. If the present administration be allowed a sufficiently long lease of tenure under its able and energetic Director-General, M. Simais, many urgent improvements in the harbour of Bushire for facilitating the landing and shipping of goods may soon be expected to be introduced. Hitherto, the supply of boats for landing and shipping cargo has been very inadequate, and when several steamers happen to be in the harbour at the same time, great inconvenience and confusion arise, resulting very often in serious detention to steamers. Apart from this, the crew by which the boats are manned are rarely trustworthy, and the result is abduction of, and tampering with, the goods entrusted to them for conveyance. To put a stop to this unsatisfactory state of affairs, M. Simais is said to be making arrangements to engage some steam barges for landing and shipping cargo in Badministkation kkrour on ——object of forming a com- Su'SSriSSiiw &gt;• r* ^.'r ^r ..«•'»»». — - Sd--«r. •/ ™ .ill. reprd to Ih.

Candles are finding favour amono- the rich class of people, and are being also used for religious gatherings and festivities. Large quantities are also sent to the interior where kerosine oil is not so extensively used. ^ i Coffee. —Speculation in this item has proved a failure owing to a very limited demand for it. Consignments sent to the interior were returned and so a a loss in Bahrein and on the Arab Coast. Cotton piece-goods—The imports improved by Es. 20,10,945 over the previous year, and though the importers did not realize profits to any appre ciable extent, they succeeded in disposing of the accumulated stocks 01 tie previous years. The high prices ruling in Manchester for a portion of the year gave a welcome relief to the merchants in Bushire, who on the whole aie sai to have realized invoice prices. Brisk business was done at paying rates m Turkey red twills and black twills which for sometime past were neglecte . Grey Mexicans, too, were in much demand, and handsome profits were nette » specially by such merchants as had contracted for them in advance at comp na tively lower rates. Yarn and Twist. —Tbe imports under this head shew fair increase owing to the demand created in the markets of the interior, this article being largely used in the manufacture of chudder^, etc. Drugs and Medicines. —Though the figures shew an increase of Rs. 28,790, they do not actually represent imports properly called, as about Rs. 25,000 areRESIDENCY AND MASK AT rOLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1900-1901. 2? on account of some opium which was returned from China having been found to be largely adulterated and consequently unfit for sale. The chief articles imported from Europe are bichromate of potash, sal ammoniac, white and green copperas and mineral waters. The chief articles imported from India are attari and country medicines and alum. Glass and Glassware. —The imports of window panes and glassware shew a fairly good increase. Prices generally have remained stationary. Cheap, showy lamps, tumblers and mirrors are in much demand. Tea-cups have been largely imported, and business in these articles is said to have been remunerative there being a large demand for them in the interior, where the bulk of the consignments are forwarded. Gold Lace and Thread. —This shews an increase of Es. 50,000 over the previous year. A considerable quantity is also imported from India and Turkey by post, for which statistics are not available. These articles are extensively used in the manufacture of Persian cloaks, ladies' chudders, veils, etc. The increase in the imports of these articles indicates that the people are again able to afford these luxuries. Hardware and Cutlery. —The increase is chiefly in iron rails, tacks, knitting and sewing machines, wires and anchors. One noticeable feature in this trade is the increase in the knitting machines for socks, etc., owing to the people in the interior having found them very handy and useful. Indigo. —Good business at paying rates has been done in this article. The manifests of steamers do not reveal any information as to the particular sort of indigo Tvhich forms the bulk of the import, but enquiries in the bazar shew that Oudh indigo is preferred to other sorts. Weaving operations on an extensive scale in the interior have stimulated the import. Matches. —Austria heads the list in the import of this article. The bulk of the import represents safety matches. During the latter part of the year business became dull, owing to the overstocked state of the market. The increase in the imports appears to be due to speculation rather than to actual increase in the demand. Metals. —Copper, tin, iron and brass all shew a substantial increase, due to the people being now in a position to replace their wares which they had to part with during the previous jears of scarcity. Kero&amp;ine oil. —Though the figures shew r an increase of Rs. 52,498 over the previous year, there has not been actual increase in the imports into Bushire. A considerable quantity was transhipped for conveyance to such ports as Koweit, Bahrein and Lingah, and the increase noted is due to such tranship ment. The bulk of the oil is imported directly from Batoum, but the firm engaged in the importation not having been able to procure a steamer, the importation during the year was made from India and distributed from Bushire to other Gulf ports. 'Porcelain and Chinaware. —The improvement noticeable in the imports is due to the previous bare state of the market which was replenished during the year. Business does not appear to have been remunerative and heavy losses frequently made are likely to shrink the trade to narrow limits. Provisions. —The increase has been chiefly contributed by the import of ghi. The import of flour has dwindled owing to the abundant crop, which has done away with the necessity of foreign importation. Sugar, loaf. —While the consumption in Bushire appears to have been stationary, re-exportation to the interior has been carried on to a larger extent than in the previous year, which accounts for the large increase of Rs. 6,00,532. France heads the list in the imports, but Egyptian loaf sugar is also coming into favour. Owing to heavy speculation resulting in the market being over stocked, business on the whole has not been remunerative. Sugar, soft. —Remarks under the above head equally apply to the import of this article, which shew an increase of Rs. 5,25,922 over the previous year. Tea. —There has been a very slight increase of import in this article. China tea has been largely imported and has paid well. It is chiefly used by persons who are addicted to the use of opium.

It is reported that hides and skins prepared in Persia are finding favour abroad, and, if plague restrictions were removed, ie trade would again assume its former dimensions. The bulk of the packages shipped to India are intended for transhipment to London and other parts o Europe. Opium. —The adulteration of Persian opium has become so apparent that cases have been returned from China, being unsuited for the markets lere. Prices have also gone up to the extent of Rs. 100 per case. A considera e quantity was exported to the United Kingdom, and Egypt also took some.^ ie export to China was 64 cases less than last year.

Silk, raw. —Large quantities of previous years' exports having remained unsold deterred shipments being made on any large scale.

A larger area was brought under cultivation, the interference of the priesthood having ceased to be as prevalent as before. It is reported that the Societe du Tombac, which enjoys the monopoly of this trade in Persia, is thinking of sub-letting its concession to Persian merchants, which might still increase the cultivation, as the growers will then have to deal with people of their own caste. Wool. —The decrease in the export is due to heavy mortality among sheep in the previous year, and a complete recovery cannot be expected just yet. The limited business done has resulted in losses. Carpets. —Though the figures shew an increase of Us. 4,20,289 over the previous year, the prices realized in London left scanty margin of profit. In Egypt, where carpets of better and larger sorts were exported, they realized handsome profits. 0. A.

REPORT ON THE TRADE AND COMMERCE OP MOHAM- MERAH AND THE KARUN RIVER FOR THE YEAR 1900 Owing to the continued embargo on the export of grain and consequent General, lack of cash among the growers, there was little increase in local trade especially on the Karun, and at Bandar Nasri, which promised to become a flourishing centre of retail trade, many of the shops have been closed. The increase shown in the annexed tables is due to larger imports for shipment to Koweit, to the rise in prices especially of cotton goods, to the openino- of the Ahwaz-Ispahan road, and to Mohammerah becoming more and more^a centre for supplying other districts. Exchange ranged from 52 to 54i Krans to the £1 sterling. The accom- Exchange panying statistics are calculated at 53 Krans to the £1 sterling. Gum. The decrease in the export of insoluble gum is due to the demand Exports, in London being poor with a falling market. The yield was unusually large. Gum Tragacanth was exported for the first time, being brought from up-country by the Ahwaz-Ispahan road. Dates. —The returns give only the amount of dates exported by steamer or by sailing craft under the British flag. In addition a large amount was exported by Arab sailing craft, of which more than usual was for the Red Sea ports. Horses. —The increase in the export of horses is due to none being shipped from Turkish ports. Oil-seed. —The crop of oil-seeds was small and prices high. Opium. —Opium arrived from the Ahwaz-Ispahan road for shipment. Wool. —The clip of wool was unusually good in quality and fairly heavy, and owing to high prices in Europe during the early part of the year a larger amount than usual was pressed at Bandar Nasri for export. There w T as again a considerable increase in imports. Coffee and American imports, piece-goods used for sails of Arab craft are nearly entirely for Koweit. The principal demand in cotton goods and their prices were as follows :— £ s. d. Krans. Grey sbirtings, 8 lbs. . , , , 0 6 2| = 16^- per piece.

This trade is nearly entirely in the hands of Jewish firms, importers from Manchester. The imports from India are largely Manchester goods for Koweit. Sugar. —There is again a large increase in loaf sugar, some of which was forwarded for up-country by the Ahwaz-Ispahan road. The bulk^ is Marseilles beet sugar, which is preferred as being more soluble^ but Egyptian sugar is making its way, and there was a small consignment of Belgian sugai. Twenty-two steamers called with cargo from and eight took cargo for shipping, Europe. The vessels of the two Bombay Companies called regularly. Returns of sailing craft under foreign flag are not available.90 ADMINISTRATION EEPOET ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL ' VrMt —Freit'lit to London ranged from 27s.

In January a barge was taken above the rapids at Ahwaz to be towed by the steamer running between that place and Shushter, which doubled her carrying capacity. Freight from Mohammerah to Nasri is about 8s., 12s. and i5s. per ton, according to description of goods. caravan routes.

The caravans generally are 20 to 23 days on the journey, but it can be done in 16 days. Dizful-Khoremabad.—^hG Dizful-Khoremabad route to the north was open till November, when robberies by the tribes again made it unsafe for caravans. Agriculture. Wheat, —The crop of wheat was a fair average one, but as export and sale to merchants was prohibited, no legitimate trade was possible on the Karun, A portion of the crop was conveyed by land to sea coast for shipment, as in former years. Prices at Nasri ranged from 125. to l^s. (Krans 32 to 38) per maund of 3| cwts. Prospects for the next harvest are not good owing to failure of the usual winter rains. The date crop was above average but smaller than 1899. Owing to an unusually dry summer the dates were deficient in syrup. Prices 5s. Sd. (Krans 15) per maund of 1J cwts. Ghee. —Clarified butter, which had fallen to 25. per 6 lb. in April, a lower price than had been touched for three years, in December owing to failure of rain had doubled in price. The price of this article is the clearest indication of the amount of fodder and consequent state of the flocks and herds. Health. The health of Mohammerah was good, with no epidemic disease. W. McDOUALL, His Britannic Majesty's Vice-Consul, Mohammerah.98 ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL P art vi.— TRADE REPORT OF BANDAR ABBAS FOR THE YEAR 1900. The year under report has seen a very notable falling off in the trade of this port, both as regards its exports and its imports. A considerable falling off in trade was anticipated this year, but it was not expected that the figures of the returns would show such a marked decrease in comparison with those of former years as is actually the case, the totals of exports and imports being respectively only 50 per cent, and 62 per cent, of those for the previous year. The special causes which have operated to produce this diminution were :— {a) The change of administration and of system in the Customs Depart ment. (6) The growing popularity of the route to Quetta vici Nushki, {c) The insecurity of the main caravan routes from Bandar Abbas to Yezd and Kerman. (d) The embargo upon cereals. {e) The heavy rates that obtained during part of the year for transport to Yezd and Kerman. To take these heads seriatim :— {a) Customs.— administration of the Customs was taken over by Belgian officials after u Nauroz/' i.e., towards the end of March. This innova tion was viewed with great disfavour by the native merchants of the Gulf ports and such of tbe inland towns as import through these ports. Attempts were made to have the new administration subverted, on the failure of which recourse was had to a system of boycotting, with the result that for four months trade was at a standstill and for six months but few consignments were cleared. By this time the merchants, seeing that the Government was determined to support the new administration, resigned themselves to the inevitable, and trade resumed its ordinary course. The Customs Department now began to rapidly make up its lost ground ; but it was not to be expected that all of this could be recovered in the three or four months that remained to the end of the year. It is calcu lated that this period of stagnation was responsible for a falling off of at least 25 per cent, in the total trade. This may possibly be in a great measure recovered in the ensuing year, as the merchants have now become used and appear to be reconciled to the new system. (&amp;) and (&lt;?) The Nushki Ti ade-route and the JBandar Abbas-Yezd and Kerman Road. —These two points are so intimately connected that they may be taken together. There is no doubt that the growing popularity of tbe trade route vtd N ushki to Quetta is telling every year more adversely upon the trade of this port. The unrest and uncertainty prevailing for some months after the handing over of the Customs to Belgian administration will this year have undoubtedly operated to divert a considerable stream of traffic from the Bandar Abbas to the Quetta outlet; and, although Bandar Abbas may hope to regain next year some of the trade thus lost, it is a question whether it will be possible to regain it entirely. As an example, it may be mentioned that the Birjand and Seistan caravans to this port, the former averaging yearly 4,000 and the latter 3,000 camels, have this year deserted Bandar Abbas entirely ^ or the first time, and it will probably be found that a very considerable portion of the trade they represent has gone to Quetta by the new trade-route. The absence of these caravans alone has had a marked effect upon the totals of the exports^ from this port, especially that of Birjand, which used to bring large quantities of saffron, the most valuable of the Bandar Abbas exports, absence of the camels forming these important caravans has also lessened the amount of transport available for the interior during the year, and thus operated unfavourably upon the rates for carriage.BESiDENCY AND MASKAT POLITICAL AGEMCY FOR THE YEAR 1900-1901.

No statistics of imports or exports are kept by the Customs authorities The figures given iu the tables have been compiled from the manifests o steamer' courteously lent by the Agents, records of native merchants, and otlfer sources ; they therefore are only approximate, but they may be taken to fairly represent the trade of tbe islands for the past year. The volume of trade, according to the returns, has declined nearly fifty, four lakhs of rupees. The retrograde movement m the trade is mainly due to the fall in the importation of rice from India and the export of pearls to the same country. . . .. The prosperity of the Bahrein Islands primarily depends upon the pearl fisherv in which about one-half of the male population is occupied. The fisherv in the vear under report opened on the 12th May under unfortunate circumstances, and closed on the 17th September. One of the principal pearl banks situated to the north of the islands, where the oysters were tound to he diseased and producing no pearls, was abandoned in the early part of the season, and this was the chief cause in the falling off in the quantity of pearls obtained. The Indian pearl merchants in the season of 1899, anticipating that the opening of the Paris Exhibition would create an abnormal demand, keenly competed for these gems, and raised the price from 40 to 60 per cent. Their expectations, however, were not fulfilled, and many of them sustained heavy losses and some became bankrupt. Though it was generally known that the pro duction of the pearl banks in the ensuing season would be short, the merchants were at first less eager to buy and offered rates which ruled in 1898. Later in the season news was received regarding a demand for small pearls in Bombay; they advanced the prices 20 per cent, to 40 per cent, above normal years, and reports have been received to the effect that on that class of pearls good profits were realized. The improvement in the Bombay pearl market will enable Bahrein merchants to realize some of their stocks, when a large amount of capital will be released and be available for the purposes of trade, which will regain some of its lost ground. In any case an increase on the year's figures for rice is expected. A reference to trade statistics of previous years will shew that there is a growing demand in all descriptions of cotton piece-goods, and this fact ought to be of interest to manufacturers and merchants in India as well as in the United Kingdom, whose attention I would particularly draw to the study of the requirements of this important market, which in time, it is expected, will develop considerably. I have been informed by the only native merchant who imports direct from the United Kingdom and does business in El Hassa that he makes an average profit of about 35 per cent, on his transactions. It has also been brought to my notice that some Manchester prints, bought in the Basrah Bazar by an enterprising native, found a ready sale which has encouraged him to repeat the transaction on a larger scale. These facts ought to be an inducement to British firms already established in the Persian Gulf, if not others, to solicit orders for home manufactures, A study also of the quantity and weight of merchandise imported into and exported from Bahrein, and the information given under the head of freight, will show that there is room for more British steamers to make Bahrein a port of call. A strict prohibition on the importation of intoxicating liquors fyr pur poses of trade was imposed in September last, and any liquor entering the country is liable to be seized and destroyed. The imports into Bahrein show a fall of over twenty-eight and-a-half lakhs oi rupees on the figures of 1899.RESIDENCY AND MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1900-1901 113 The decline is principally due to tlie large stocks of rice remaining on hand from the previous year and the general scarcity of money owinc* to fame parcels of pearls originally bought on credit having remained in^Bombav unsold until late in the year and the dealers being unable to pay the vendors in time to allow of their distributing the proceeds amongst the pearl-divers. India, whose share of the exports to Bahrein is about three-fifths of the whole, sent goods to the value of twenty-one lakhs of rupees less than in 1899 The decrease is chiefly in rice to the extent of nineteen lakhs of rupees • cotton' piece-goods, a lakh and-a-half, metals, Rs. 3,000 ; China-ware, Rs. 3,000 •' planks' Es. 3,000 ; and specie seven and-a-half lakhs. On the other hand, coffee shewed an improvement of Rs. 52,000 ; coir yarn, Es. 6,000 ; yarn and twist. Rs. 88 000 • lubricating oils, Es. 3,000 ; raw silk and silk piece-goods, Rs. 19,000; turmeric , Es. 5,000 ; soft sugar, Es. 17,000 ; tea, Es. ^,000; gunny bags, Es. 3,000 • hard ware, Es. 8,000; and cutlery, Es. 10,000. The Turkish Empire's share of exports to Bahrein declined six lakhs of rupees, mainly due to some of the pearl dealers sending their pearls direct to Bombay instead of selling them in Bahrein. Grain and specie show a decline of Es. 15,000 and Rs, 40,000, respectively, and pearls, Rs. 6,80,000; while horses increased Es. 15,000; coffee, Es. 1,500; dates, Es. 2,16,000; ghee, Es. 38,000- silk and silk goods, Es. 7,000; and tobacco, Es. 11,000. There was an advance of about two lakhs of rupees in the imports from Persia, owing to a large trade done in grain on account of the temporary suspension ot the embargo on grain by the Government of that country, and an increase in the export of specie. There was, however, a considerable fall in the value of cattle, cotton, cutlery, fuel, kerosine, pearls, and provisions. Zanzibar exported Es. 19,000 worth of rafters less than in 1899, owino&gt; to the rigorous regulations imposed by the authorities in German East Africa on native crafts calling there, and the increase in price in the article on account of the Africans being prohibited from selling except through Germans. The export trade for the past year has declined twenty-five lakhs and twenty Exports thousand rupees on the total of 1899. The principal items showing a fall are—pearls, Es. 28,50,000 ; rice, Es. 2,80,000; canvas, Es. 22,000; cotton piece- goods, Es. 4^,000; sugar, Es. 6,000; and rafters, Rs. 4,000. The export of horses increased Rs. 7,000; donkeys, Rs. 85,000; coffee, Rs, 24,000; dates, Rs. 74,000; wheat and barley, Rs. 98,000; kerosine, Rs. 16 ,000 ; ghee, Rs. 6,000; shells, of all kinds, Rs. 45,000; silk and silk goods, Rs. 7,000; tobacco, Rs. 5,000; tallow s Rs. 2,000; and specie, Rs. 6,61,000. Coinage. —The Indian Government rupees and the Maria Theresa dollars Miscellaneous, are the two principal coins in which business is transacted. The latter coin is universally employed by the Bedouins, and from May to September there is a considerable demand for it to pay for the pearls imported intoJBahrein, when the rate for the same fluctuates between Rs. 140 to Rs. 150 per 100 dollars, according to the demand and supply. During the past year the price fluctuated near the lower figure owing to the decrease of pearls imported, and consequently there was a less demand for the coin. Freight. —Pearls and dates are the chief products exported to India. The freight on pearls was half per cent, on the declared value throughout the year, and on the 700 tons of dates carried by steamers Rs. 12-8 per ton was charged. Indian and Arab sailing crafts took 1,450 tons of dates and 740 tons of grain to Karachi at Rs. 10-8 per ton, owing to no space being available in steamer bottoms. For a similar reason, coupled with the demand for an excessive rate of freight, the bulk of shells exported goes to Bushire in native crafts, and from there is shipped by direct steamers to London. This cargo might be secured by steamers touching here on their way to India and arranging to tranship the same at Bombay to cheap freighters to London. It may be interesting to British shipping to learn that annually, during the last quarter of each year, from 5,000'to 6,000 tons of dates are exported from Katif and Ojair to Indian ports, and for want of steam conveyance the whole of it is secured by sailing crafts. A certain quantity is also exportedADMINISTRATION KEPOKT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL 114 n4-ci frv T^crvnt find. tliG liGV^iitj 3.nd. tll6 A -UStlltlll sliip CcilypoQ is S; srrcistsz'sL, p»;s.u, ..&lt;!
