Welcome proposal to revive post of Vice-Consul BANDAR ABBAS and agree that NICHOLSON most (? g.o.' suitable) for appointment if LESTER can be sent here. 5 . For following reasons I am doubtful of the desirability of separating BANDAR ABBAS from KERMAN: (a) BANDAR ABBAS is port of KERMAN and is administered by Govemor-Ceneral of Kerman. (b) BANDAR ABBAS and SEISTAN are both under GOC KERMAN who frequently discusses military problems of that area. (c) The Consul at KERMAN can easily get down to BANDAR ABBAS in two days. I myself plan to go there in Decerober or early January. To be paraphrased before communication to any outside Office. /(d)■ % 4. . (d) Vice-Consul would presumably be (? g*o.) some recess in sunmer. Most suitable place for recess would be KERMAN. (e) Both posts have joint accounts and single treasury which would be maintained with minimum of adjustment. 4. Suggest for consideration that NICHOLSON should retain designation of Vice-Consul KERMAN which is presumably valid for whole consular area including BANDAR ABBAS (see para 8 of FALCONER’S letter 54 dated 7th February 1942). This would not prevent him from living at BANDAR ABBAS for greater part of the year and would enable him to function also in KERMAN if convenient at any time. Even is his area were extended to include e.g. L3NGAH I doubt if it would be necessary to amend his Exequatur in view of the fluidity of Persian administrative organisation in that area. 5 .

The reason for the revival of the post is for Gulf work, including shipping, naval and even navicerts and of course intelligence. There are disadvantages in divided control, and past practice nas been that posts in Gulf ports should be superintended from BUSIHRE. 3 . With regard to BARLOW* s points (a) to (e), the position as between SHIRAZ and BUSHIEE provides some analogy and recess in KERMAN would always be possible during which if required the Vice- Consul could assist with the Kerman work. The division of Treasury will not, in PRIOR's opinion, cause any difficulty. 2 ,., The Government of India, therefore, advise that the post be designated as Vice-Consul at BANDAR ABBAS, and be superintended from BUSHIRE with recess in KERMAN.

Government of India’s proposal to revive post of Vice-Consul, Bandar Abbas and to abolish post of Vice-Consul, Kerman. In 1933 the consular districts of Kerman and Bandar Abbas were amalgamated for reasons of economy. A Consular Office was established at Bandar Abbas and the Consul at Kerman was to spend some months in the year there. In June, 1941 &gt; the Government of India suggested the re-opening, with officers from India, of certain Vice- Consulates in Persia, among them Bandar Abbas, and invited the views of the Political Resident and Kis Majesty’s Minister, Tehran. The Political Resident replied that in his opinion the re-opening of a Vice-Consulate at Bandar Abbas is fully justified by extra work entailed in Navy Certificate system rt . His Majesty’s Minister, however, said that ”His Majesty's Consul at Kerman holds that the re-opening of the Vice-Consulate at Bandar Abbas would not be justified either by economic warfare work or by political advantages” and suggested that a Vice-Consul should be appointed at Kerman who could be detached for periods of duty at Bandar Abbas, which would have the advantage of not requiring the agreement of the Persian Government. The Government of India, therefore, when they put their proposals to His Majesty’s Government, suggested 'one officer as assistant to Consul, Kerman, agrement as Vice-Consul being sought later. This would cover Bandar Abbas”. This proposal was sanctioned. A recommendation by the Government of India that the Vice-Consul, Kerman, should be'paid on the time scale of the Indian Political Service with various allowances was sanctioned in Deceniber. » 0 * • # • In July this year His Majesty's Minister, Tehran, in a telegram to the Foreign Office- stated 'now that R.A.P. /aerodromesaerodromes are 'being made in South East Persia we need a Vice-Consul for Bandar Abhas”. The G-ovemment of India Ext.5287/42. have now telegraphed proposing to revive the post of Vice-Consul, Bandar Abbas, - on the same terms as before, to be superintended from Bushire with recess in Kerman. His Majesty's Minister, Tehran, has agreed to the proposal and considers that direct superintendence from Bushire might be an advantage so far as shipping matters are ^ concerned. ^'he G-ovemment of India propose that the post Ex 26/42. of Vice-Consul, Kerman, should be abolished, the present incumbent, Lieutenant P.P.G. Nicholson, being sent to Bandar Abbas. They are sanctioning the post of Extra Assistant, Kerman, presumably under the present arrangement by which His Majesty* s Government and the Government of India can each sanction expenditure up to £1,000 without reference to the other. The Government of India's proposal does not appear to involve the sanctioning of any expenditure by His Majesty* s Government . 36 It is suggested that subject to the views of the B’oreign Office this proposal might be approved. A draft letter to the Foreign Office asking for their concurrence is submitted. (Sgd.) M. Odgers, 23.12.42. It will apparently be necessary to secure the agreement . of the Persian Government to the re-opening of the Bandar Abbas Vice-Consulate (with the consequent alteration of the district of H.M. Consul at Kerman); and to the appointment of Lt. Nicholson there. It is for the Foreign Office to decide exactly what instructions should be given to Sir R. Bullard in the matter: but a sentence has been added to the draft suggesting that some instructions will be needed. (Sgd. ) E.W.R. Lumby, 28.12.42. Under-Secretary. (initialled) R.T.P. 2.1.43.

(fk Under Secretary of State The Foreign Cffice ask us to pass on to the Government of India an expression of their appreciation of the services of Major G.A.Falconer, who has recently been transferred to a post in India after holding charge of H.M.Consulate at Kerman (including the Vice-Consulate at Bandar Abbas) since November 1937* They mention as especially comnendable his handling of the food supply problem during recent months, and the tact and skill which he displayed in managing Reza Shah's embarkation at Bandar Abbas last year. Major Falconer's difficulties and accomplishments in dealing with the food situation are related in the side-line^ passages of his News Summaries, flagged A, B, and C. It will be seen that it was owing to his pressure that the Economic Department at Kerman was induced in July to disgorge their considerable sugar stocks in the form of monthly rations to the townspeople. The report for the second half of July suggests that the Consul's energy in collecting information of hoarded wheat stocks jWith the object of organising a raid on the hoarders at an appropriate moment, had been instrumental in iafcnGducing the black rate. In the first half of August he was urging the G-.O.C. to improve the arrangements for the administration of the town bakery. Major Falconer's report on the ex-Shah's departure is flagged at Ext. 7513/41. It is proposed that, in forwarding the Foreigi Office letter to the Government of India, the Secretary of State should associate himself with their expression of appreciation; and that the Government of India should be asked to pass on these encomiums to Major Falconer. A draft in this sense is submitted.Ext.5719/42 Draft letter 0*IC«Caroe ^ G • S • X • jG •X»Xt* ^ X#C • 3 • j External Affairs Department, Government of India, / •£7 OCT 1942 Dear Caroe, I enclose a copy of a denii—official letter from the Foreign Office expressing their appreciation of Falconer* s services during his tenure of office as H.M.Consul at Kennan. The Secretary of State desires to associate himself with the views expressed hy tne Foreign Office, 2 . If you see no objection, would you please pass on to Falconer what is said in this letter and that from the Foreign Office. Yours sincerely. -46 FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.1. 20th October, 1942 You will probably have seen from his l as ^ Diary that Falconer has now handed over the Kerman Consula ,e to Barlow. Falconer will, I suppose, now have returned to India, but I wonder if you would agree to let Caroe know how much we valued the good work which he did diirine his long spell of nearly five years a b Kerman* Life must have been comparatively dull and uneventful for much of Falconer’s time at Kerman, but his success in inducing the local authorities to make an effort to deal with the problem of food supplies j.or the ueople shows that he made good use of the quiet vears to establish his influence and impose his^ authority on the local notables. We were also impress- ed with the tact and skill with which he accomplished the awkward task of seeing Reza Shah off at Bandar Abbas last year. If you agree, perhaps you would let Caroe know our views. C . W . R.T. Peel, Esq., C.B.E. , India Office.

Bailee's confidential demi-official letter No. Jf. 24( 4 )-k/ 37, dated 2nd June. &amp; • I enclose a copy of a telegram No 22, dated 3rd July, received from Major Lincoln in reply to my telegram informing him that he would he relieved hy Major Falconer about the middle of September. 3. No doubt the orders came as a surprise and a shock to Major Lincoln, who is disappointed at not being allowed to continue at Kerman until November of next year. * 4. Majors Lincoln has raised three main points (a) that I should recommend to Government that he be kept on until November 20th 19 33, (b) that as a special case he should be given a gratuity of jss 3000, (c) that he has not received benefits under the Lee Commission passage rules. 5. The following general considerations apply to Major Lincoln* s case. He is an I.M.D. officer, who, as he points out, has been acting in the Indian Political Service. Except for two of the years that he was at Khorramshahr he was His Majesty's Vice-Consul, and for the last five years he has been His Majesty's Consul at Kerman, holding in addition to the post at Bandar Abbas. enclosure in INDIA POLITICAL SECRETARY'S! 4 SMV Letter Dated 23 IUL 193 7 r-.- ■ i CD JI'L 193 7 j;at Bandar Abbas* He has therefore for nearly the whole of his service been acting in much higher paid posts than if he had remained an officer. The posts he has held carry emoluments considerably above those that any I*M*D» officer Liay expect. ^lajor Lincoln for example is now drawing about Es 1900 whereas an I.M.D. officer of his service would be drav/ing roughly half that amount. It seems to me, therefore, that Major Lincoln has been suitably rewarded for his services and can have no grievances at not being allowed to finish his service in his present post. 6. As regards paragraph 4(a). While agreeing that Major Lincoln has done satisfactory work at Kerman and Bandar Abbas (vide for example despatch ho. 56 ^ dated 21st March 1935 from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to His Excellency the Viceroy) I am not of the opinion that there are sufficient grounds for me to recommend to Government that his services should be extended and X think that the post should now be a.i3 1eo by an officer of the Political Service. 7. As regards paragraph 4(b). In viewr of the considerations noted in my paragraph 5 above I am not of the opinion that fajo Lincoln has claims for a gratuity. 8. As regards paragraph 4(c). As Major Lincoln is not an officer of the Indian Political Service X do not think that he has any grounds for complaint. Sd/- T.G.Powle. Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Attested.

I had hoped to hold this post until November 20th 1938 which is date on which I attain age for compulsory retirement. Under proposed arrangement of relieving me middle of September this year and my taking fourteen months leave pending retirement I shall suffer considerable pecuniary loss which I can ill afford on account of having to help my two sons in the Army, having made my plans to stay at Kerman lor another year and having laid in stores etc. for that period. In these circumstances I beg that you will kindly give the question your favourable consideration anu approach Government of India to postpone decision for a year and allow me to continue inm my present appointment until I complete my full service • In the event of this being impracticable I beg that you will kindly make representations to Government of India pointing out my grievances and hardships caused and recommending as that Government of India should at least grant mep^a special case a gratuity, the equivalent of difference between my present salary surplus allowances and salary I would draw while on combined leave for next fourteen months, which would amount approximately to Es 8000, to compensate me for loss I would sustain. This gracious act on the part of the Government of India would be a great relief and help to me as I will have to break /2 i- break up my house, precipitately dispose oi* ray effects and return to England; besides it would be a token of appreciation for services rendered by me. I submit that I have completed thirty three years Governrrjent service and I have served twenty eight years in jBersia of which twenty one years have been under the Foreign ana Political Department and I am proud enough to think that I have thoroughly earned this reward for long and efficient service. Of my twenty one years under the Foreign and Political Department I spent sixteen years at Khorramshahr, which was not an easy post at that time as I had to deal with a large and powerful Corporation like the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and fulfil my duties and obligations to the best of my ability, and five years at Kerman. I also beg to add that during these twenty one years I have never been granted the privileges admissible to officers of the Foreign and Political Department under the Lee Commission rules which accounts for ray having taken only 31 months leave during the thirty three years service owing to not receiving passage concession. - Britconsul.1613 .
