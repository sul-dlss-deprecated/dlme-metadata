In particular the correspondence details the British financial relationship with the Governor of Fars, Farman Farma [ʿAbd-al-Ḥosayn Mīrzā Farmānfarmā], and his role in maintaining governance and order in Shiraz. This is in the wider context of the Persian famine of 1917-1919 caused partly by the requisitioning of foodstuffs by the occupying British and Russian armies.The principal correspondents in the volume are: the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (Arthur James Balfour); the Director of Military Intelligence, War Office; the Deputy Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department; HM Minister, Tehran (Sir Charles Marling); the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs; the Under-Secretary of State for India; the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (Percy Zachariah Cox).Each part includes a divider which gives the subject and part numbers, the year the subject file was opened, the subject heading, and a list of correspondence references contained in that part by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><geographic>Persia</geographic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Director of Military Intelligence</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Persian Governor-General of Fars Province</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Iran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Foreign and Political Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Financial aid</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x0001d8#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
