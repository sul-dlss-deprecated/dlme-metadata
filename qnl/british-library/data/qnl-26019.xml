It seems possible however that a copy of the hook exists at Peking, as the pre-1931 Embassy archives were retained there, and handed to Monsieur Hoeppli, the Swiss Representative in Peking, in 1942, presumably after the destruction of the confidential archives. The ar hives from the Embassy at Peking for the years 1931- 1St39* contained in eighty four cases, were sent to Calcutta in 1941» and they are still there.
