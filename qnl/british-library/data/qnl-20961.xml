The account of ;,-the Turkish atrocitieg In Kerbala forr/arded here by the Chief Political Officer, copies of which were dis tributed amongst the Persian and Shia community, has made a great impression. Shaikh Khalaf bin Sheikh Ahmed the head Shia Qazi of Bahrain, who came to see me the other day, without any prompting whatsoever himself broached the subject, and helt forth vigorously in the strongest terms of opprobrium* on the 'inhuman', 'savag®', and 11 irreligious' action of the Turks on the occasion to question# I am informed that he expresses the same views to his followers in his Mosque, and other places of assembly. The Sunni community, whose feelings as Sunnis are of course hostile to Shias, are - as was to be expected - more or leas indifferent to the persecutions of Shias by their fellow sectarians. 93. Najd.
