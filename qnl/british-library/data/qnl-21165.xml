Political Agent .Bahrein,Tours of P.O.T.C.in the months of December 1941 and January 1942 When P.A.was on tour on the Trucial Coast last December he thought it would be worth trying to tour overland from here to Bahrein,and also mentioned that a good tour would be one to have a look at the islands in the Gulf,between here and Bahrein which are rarely visited by Political Officers.The first tour did not, as will appear from these notes,prove feasible;the second I carried out.The following is a diary of ak.the attempt at the first and of the second. mh. December 1941.Shar t jah to Abu Dhabi.On reaching Abu Dhabi I was t put up in the Sheikhs battered guest house.When he came to see me 1 broached my project of travelling overland by camel from Abu Dhabi to Sila 1 ,a distance of about 200 miles,and asked the Sheikh's help in the matter of providing camels.The journey is all through his territory. If it came off y I was to be met by a launch at Sila 1 which me 1 ould take A to Bahrein.-Sheikh Shakbut seemed quite willing to help but mystified as to why I shiuld want to go by camel rather than by aeroplane.However he promised that the camels would be ready in a da^ or two day's time. 12th.December.In the morning the Sheikh confirmed his promise about the camels.Shortly aiter he left me,his maternal uncle,Sheikh Hamid bin Buti,was announced,with the rider that he had come to see me about the-MMM9After a deal of talk with him and some coming and going on his part,we agreed that I wanted eight animals as the march V0Uld be 0ne of not 1688 than eight days through country shhrt of water and of fodder.Bedou were to supply the camels and to come with them,with two of the Sheikh's men as an escort.All seemed well until we started to discuss costs.Hamid bin Buti wanted me to pay IM o. for each camel and Rs.100.to each of the Sheikh's men-i.e.the journey was to cost 5s.520.in the first place, (in view of subsequent experien- -oes I am sure that the cost would ultimately have been greater had I I agreed to Sheikh Hamid's initial terms).Ultimately I stated to Sheikh Hamid that I could not undertake the Journey at the cost which he a.ked for transported I sent a message to Sheikh Shakbut that was returning to Sharjab that afternoon.I was taken at my word and allowed to K o after the usual courtesies.Of course the Sheikh knew2 why I was leavingbut he seemed unwilling to discuss,or rathe^, avoided the subject and I did not press it.I gathered that Sheikh Hamid has some influence over him,and that the same Sheikh Hamid is a man always anxious to drive a very hard bargain and of an avarici ous disposition•This.and not any desire on the part of oheikh Shakbut to prevent me from crossing his territory apparently explained the price demanded from me.Also it appears that wherever,as in Abu Qhabi the representatives of Oil Companies have travelled,the impression has been created amongst the Arabs that foreigners can afford prices beyond the dreams of avarice.I arrived back in Sharjah late in the \ evening. 15th.December. The only motor launch available in Dibai for the journey to Bahrein was one /30 ft.long with a beam of 9ft.and a 'jolboat' hull.It was used for carrying passengers to and from the steamers calling here,but I was told that they regarded it as dangerous on account of it's smallness.lt proved a very good sea boat but will never be used as a tender again.We motored in it, coasting along the shore,to Khor Ghanadah on the first day out. '• T e arrived there too late to get in to the Khor through the shoals, 'r but I had a look at on a 1bth.December.It seemed shallow,with two entrances,apparently around an island.-We left there at 9 a.m. on a course N.N.W.-more or less. he only instruments of navigation with our w naukhada' were an old compass,though it seemed to be by a good English maker,a half circle cut out of cardboard by himself, and a pair of very oifl French binoculars which he appar ently only used at night. Fortunately I had a land map with me and an Admiralty chart for the first part of our route.-''e made good going for'sir bu Na'ir Island,doing the 40 miles to there in 5 hours,with the usual lateen sail helping the engine for the last three.I landed on the island in the afternoon.lt seemed abo- ut three miles long and was uninhabited.I was told that pearlers 4 visited it in the summer to take on fairly fresh water and I saw on the ground there the red iron oxide which used, I was toldfbe taken to England. ^ 17th.December.Started for the island of Zirko at Ta.m.Very good going with engine and sail to within sight of Zirko at 1 2 .30.,when the engine failed and wind fell.As a result v.e did not anchor off thewmmmmmmm r\ 4 3 * '-x island until after dark.The 'Persian Gulf PiloVreports that 'r-ome^^/j us swells roll around the island'. They caused to shift to what did not prove to be a much easier lying anchorage at 2 a.m.I saw the island by landing on it on 18th.December.It is about 2^ miles long ,like Sir bu Na f r,composed of volcanic hills,but with a high peak in it 1 s centre.It is uninhabited, the property of Abu Dhabi.Pearlers visit it in the summer and cormorants make it their base.-This day we made for Dalmah Island h but our course was faulty and we fetced up in the evening,anchored in the very fine Khor (meriton bay shown on the Admiralty chart) of Sir Bani Yas island(Abu Dhabi).A sheltered deep anchorage was a pleasant change.I saw the aerodrome at Sir Bani Yas on 19th.December.It's surface seemed adequate but the area small.The one lonely 'nautor' employed to guard it was present.He told me of habit ation and palm trees at the north end of the island but I did not see them.^he engine of the launch was totally out of order onthis day and we made a course for Sila'-on the mainland of Abu Dhabi at 10.a.m. We were going well enough on a S.W. tack when a 'shimal' came on and caused instant terror to the 'naukhada' and his crew of five.In fact the launch,under it's big sail was showing an alarming tendency to gybe.The naukhada wanted to run in and anchor fe-to the east of Jabal him Dhanni but I gotj^to ta.ke a westerly course and we beat along the pnore of the mainland until the evening.Tv e anchored off shore,I estimated,about 20miles east of Sila in a heavy sea for our craft. During the night the 'shimal'freshened. 20th.December.It looked as if we were going to have to spend an indefinite period at our uneady station for the 'naukhada'swore his tackle would give away,the launch founder,and all of us be drowned if we ventured to sail in the 'shimal'.He and the crew took the engine down and extracted pounds of filth from it.I got them to move off under sail about noon as the wind had lessened and we tacked to the N.E. for an hour or so and then they got the engine going.We anchored off shore N.of Slla' after nightfall in deep water. 2lst.December.Made north with a lame engine,but I think the 'naukhada-S shore hug 0 ing propensities caused him to motor too far W.of N.and found ourselves amongst the myriads of small islands and shoals i mouth of Khor adh Dhawaihin.The engine then we gave up and we did not4. the island of Kafai y(,which was directly on our course until 2 .30 p.m.It is long,narrow and said to have anchorages,at any rate for small craft.We kept going under sail arid engine(when it worked) until near midnight. December. nd.S.jteabei.- sailed and motored feebly past Wakrah to Dohah.There . Sheikh Hamid,the son of the ruler,Sheikh Salih al Mane,and Abdulla bin Pai-ii befriended me and sent me to the Oil Company 1 s camp in the Sheikh Hamid's car.After a night at Dukhan I arrived in Bahrein in the Oil Go's launch. In Bahrein the representative of Sheikh Mustafa bin Abdul L tif,the owner of the launch in which I had travelled from Dubai told me that It's engine was being thoroughly py repaired. January 1942Left Bahrein In the 'repaired' launch whicn some master off irony named the 'Ghazal'.The engine gave up for a while but was soon re-started.Bight fell with the Qatar coast dimly visible. We moved on taking Foundings and then,fearing shoals and rocks y the 'naukhada' anchored about a mile from the coast too far away to be heltered from the swell on which we rolled all nignt. 3rd.January.Decide to try to mak B the island of Halul but course- plotting was not ealy as we had to guess where we were starting from. Up to evening there was no sight of any land.We motored on during the night,it being too deep to anchor.The wihd freshened and changed to the *iBd engine irretrievably surrendered,blowing a Piston to bits and a connecting rod through the crank case.We ran before the wind with a small.very much 'ad hoc' staysail.l estimated W ' ^ ab0Ut 120 *iles until the dawn of 4 th.

When I returned to the launch it was fast aground and by 10 p.m. was high and dry.The incoming tide started to knock it about during the early hours of the morning and efforts to warp the boat out but against tide and wind were not very effective^such as they were they probably saved it from being broken up.By 6 a.m. on 6th.January.we were aground again.I walked over quite a stretch of the island and met a couple of wood collectors from Abu Dhabi who had their boat moored on the inland side.They tried to persuade me to make for Abu Dhabi by Running before the Wind between the island and the mainland.I viewed the shallow waters of the way indicated with considerable suspicion in view of the 3? ft.draught of our boat;this suspicion I learnt later was justified.We could not move in thdse waters without a very competent pilot.The Admiralty t chart shows them covering shoals of very large area.-In the afternoon we managed to move away from the shore to a slightly deeper anchorage alongside a small 'Sama 1 ' manned by three men irom Abu Dhabi who had been collecting camel fodder at Dalmah island and had also had a bad time in the shimal. 7th.January.There was a long sand spit running parallel to the shorepractically enclosing the shallow water in which we lay. » were more shallows on which the waves broke white, and beyond them the deep water of the Gulf.The problemn was to find the way out through the shallows which we had come in. J-he Abu Dhabi men left at noon as their food was running short and they said they preferred the 'shimal' to their 'dying of hunger'.The same consideration moved my 'nauk ;hada'to try to get out,though our draught prevented us from taking the path of the ' 'sama- '.'e spent a weary day warping and poling and going aground. .—— I • N- medicinal.We travelled on the higher ground overlooking the motor track on rolling sand dunes,because on them grows the scrub on which th© camels feed. and. 'the wells are in amongs't theiTi—there are merely wells,no villages in 'that country.^he wells I saw and our halting places were Gharayah ,Boomeraygah,DoweybijSamaih'^Hov.th and Noweybi. On the journey I had my meals with Sheikh Ibrahim at one fire and his men,separate from us,at another.I gave them all a days hospitality when we arrived here.,and a 'kiramah' of OO.to the Sheikh.Ke and his men went away pleased.They all then spent a day with the Sheikh of Dubai and then departed for their home inland.-A camel saddle would be worth having on expeditions like this one;a goat skin only is not wholly comfortable.D.O.

Many thanks for your telegram No.401 dated June 4th. Sorry I am against your proposal as I do not believe Political Officer could manage the work at all satisfactorily by dividing his time between four aerodromes involved my opinion being that what is wanted for aerodromes here is constant watch ing of situations and prevention of trouble rather than interven- tion when it has occurred; for this reason I have put Jackson in charge of Masirah and Salalah only and hope to look after Ras- al-Hadd myself. Masirah and Salalah do need constant observatioi owing to primitive nature of conditions and inhabitants. Example of former is that all unloading dhows now wish to leave Masirah because of r/^nsoon while the fresh arrival of H.P•?. personnel Salalah and reported proposal to send 200 Americans said to be of bad type there could easily provide example of latter. Another reason against proposal is difficulty of two Political Agents sharing control of Jackson. y K vj Political.V«V\ Confidential * Political Agency, yotC/1221 * Bahrain, the 10th August 1942• To The Hobble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf f Camp| Bahrain* Po litical Officer, Truclal Co«at . Memorandum. When, several months ago, Mr. Pelly left Sharjah I took the Tie* that little harm would be done if the post of Political Officer, Trucial Coast, were left vacant for a time. I took this view partly because I felt that Khan Sahib Abdur Razzak could be trusted to carry out the political work of the Trucial Coast in a satisfactory manner, and partly because I expected to be able myself to visit Sharjah at least once a month, and possibly v more often, to see that everything was going on smoothly* 2. My confidence in Khan Sahib Abdur Razzak was not mis placed? but I have been disappointed in my expectation that I would myself be able to visit Shar.jah at fairly frequent inter vals; and the results have been unfortunate in several ways. 3. I have no hesitation in affirming that one of the major reasons for the comparative failure of the effort to recruit companies of levies f or the protection of the R.A.P. aerodromes at Sharjah and Dubai has been the absence of a British Political Officer who could have guided and advised the officers in charge of the Levy Companies in their relations with the Shaikhs and thus have secured the Shaikhs' energetic co-operation in securing recruits of the right type. The effort tc raise units of 1f\*A.F• levies at Sharjah and Dubai has only been partially successfuij I do not think it can be wholly successful until the post of i \ Political Officer, Trucial Coast, is again filled by a British Officer in a position to give advice to the officers in charge of the Companies of Levies. 4* An even more compelling reason why the post should again be filleji as soon as possible is the presence in Sharjah / of■ -2- of a continually increasing number of R.A.F. officers and men. There are already 40 officers and 500 men stationed in Sharjah and that number is likely to be increased substantially in the near future. I need not enlarge upon the problems that arise when large numbers of men are quartered near native bazaars in conditions which do not permit of healthy exercise or recreation* So far, thanks both to the tact of Khan 3ahib Abdur Razzak and to the excellent discipline maintained by the two officers who have successively commanded the R «A «F. detachment at Sharjah, awkward incidents have either been avoided or smoothed over. But this happy state of affairs cannot last indefinitely; and, in any case, Khan Sahib Abdur Razzak is absolutely unable to move away from his headquarters when so much is required of him at Sharjah, with the result that his political work Is suffering* 5* Finally, the question of food supplies, including the distribution of quotas among numerous clamouring Shalkhdoms, the prevention of illicit exports, the control of merchants and the allocation of shipping space, present problems which it is not fair to ask Khau Sahib Abdur Hazzak to shoulder unaided. 6. In viev.' of these considerations I would urge most strongly that the post of Political Officer Traclal Coast should again be filled at the earliest possible moment* % $ Political Agent, Bahrain. v■ ¥ 64/ii7 Telegram; ^ Fromx To; 1^0.4 5 Dated ana receivea 29th January 194 H.ii.

I have warned him that the transport may be difficult but that you might be able to put him on to where it can be hired. He is representing 'Shell 11 and is going to the Trucial Coast to renew his old acquaintance with the Rulers there. He tells me that Sir Rupert asked him not to mention to them the 'Continental Shelf' and he is not going to do so. Bertram Thomas does not want to strain your accommodation resources if you find it difficult; so I have told him that if you cannot put him up, you will probably get him a room in the Fort.

(123/12/49) nt It is prescribed in Foreign Service Regulation No. 6 relating to travelling allowances, vide paragraph c, that any journey may be considered as on public service which an officer makes with the authority of the Secretary of State, and that the Secretary of State may delegate to the head of a diplomatic mission authority to sanction Journeys by members of the service in the territories within his Jurisdiction. The Foreign Office have now agreed that such authority may be delegated to the Political Resident and also that officers subordinate to the Political Resident may be pern-it ted by him to tour in their districts without prior sanction provided: (a) they inform him beforehand of their proposed absences from headquarters, and (b) due regard is had to economy. Would you kindly be guided by the^e instructions so far as tours within your district are concerned in future? 2. At the same time, I suggested to the Foreign Cffice that the Political Resident should be permitted to summon officers from Kuwait, the Trucial Coast and Muscat to Bahrain from time to time for consultation. To this the Foreign Office have replied 'we should have no objection to officers being summoned from Kuwait, the Trucial Coast and Muscat to Bahrain from time to time for consultations, but we should like you to adopt the practice which is usual at Diplomatic Missions of consulting the Foreign Office before such conferences are called'. I am taking up this point further as I think my meaning may have been misunder stood, but you should bear in mind that for the present, before the Political Agents, Kuwait and Muscat, and the Political Officer Trucial Coast can visit Bahrain, It will be necessary to obtain the sanction of the Foreign Cffice.

Stobart should come away from Sharjah at the end of October on transfer to his next post. His place at Sharjah should be taken by Wilton when he returns from leave, and for the short interval between Stobart 1 s departure and 'Jilton's return Michel should move over to Shar^ah temporarily from Kuwait• Jacomb should stay on at Doha for the time being.

In recruiting the levies Captain Lyle who was in charge of this work was faced with difficulties from time to time. Moreover, the H .A .F. had formerly only a small detachment at oharjah. But now they are a full squadron with 12 officers and 300 men. An even greater number of H .A .F. personnel is expected at Sharjah which is probably going to be a control centre for reinforcement air craft. In addition substantial construction works are in progress. 2. I said that I did not think it likely that a Political Officer could be spared for the post. C.C. R.A.F. Sharjah then suggested that Mr. Jackson, who is looking after a num ber of aerodromes on the Muscat coast, should have his headquarters at Sharjah where he would have aircraft always available in which to visit other aerodromes. This suggestion seemed to me a good one but beiore making it to the Resident I thought it advisable to ob tain P.A. Muscat's views. I therefore sent my telegram No.401 dated 4th June 1942. 3. P.A. Muscat's reply No.C/669 dated 5th June 1942 shows that there are serious draw backs in the suggestion made. I will visit Sharjah as soon as I can and after my visit wilX decide whether I should make a reference to the Resident in order to secure a separate officer as P.O.T.C. 15/6/42.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000393_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/2/180</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000393</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/2/180</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'3/3 Political Officer, Trucial Coast'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1939/1950</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2014-07-23T00:08:46</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (156 folios)</extent><extent>Foliation: There are two different sequences of foliation.
