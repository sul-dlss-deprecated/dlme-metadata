Some time ago I asked him whether he would care to have any British soldiers sent up- I said that it would be convenient in some ways if the suitability of^plateau as a sanatarium could now be tested, and remarked that 40 or 50 lw~u l ^ b-*-~ British soldiers wor-e an appreciable addition to the strength of his escort- I intended, if Wahab 1 s reply should be favourable, to ask pex miss ion to send up about that number of men; but he replied that, in view of the attitude and conduct of the Turks, he thought it would be inadvisable to send any British soldiers to Dthali- On receiving this answer ( which was by no means unexpected) I of course let the matter drop. You will see that in the letter enclosed, 'Vahab says that he now thinks it would be unwise of him to any longer decline the offer of British troops, and he evidently expects me to send guns as well- The men, who are really intended to strengthen the escort, are tojrffa xLZ.isr&gt; r-rJTfK'V ■BPMBeaa SSBSBmiUbUMir - rim r r ent nominally for change of air, and Wahab asks me to explain this to the Governor General of Yemen* I was willing to this^but felt that, as regards the guns at- le&amp;st, it would be necessary to admit that they were required for the defence of Wahab' s camp* Your telegram of 15th April leaves me dis cretion to send any force to Dthali that may be noofrB- ^u,for the protection of the Commission^ but disapproved of the proposed move of the British detachments* The march of the latter has accordingly/' been stoxjped, but Wahab evidently wants the troops, and I am not, at the distance of 90 miles, nearly so well able to judge what is necessary for the protection of the Commission as Wahab himself* The tone of his-letter is rather that of leaving things to me, but this is not quite fair* I believe he is very glad to’have the reinforcements of Native Infantryk have sent £im, but I could not I get him to ask for them ; and I sent them on my own res ponsibility* I shall now tell him that it is for him to declare what he wants* I will then endeavour, sub ject to orders from India, or the India Office, to com- ply, but it is right to put on me the responsibili' ~\ tthe detachments, I am myself inclined to douht the wisdom of despatching a small number of British sol diers at the present time* A month or six weeks ago it might have been all right, but Wahab was then against the plan* My. own idea would be to send either none^or/t^ more considerable force, but under the circumstances all I could do was to wdor the detachments^ and report for orders* I do not know whether you realize that our coimnunication with Wahab is slow* We have a camel dak which starts from each end every other day* It takes at least eight days to get a reply from Dthali, so I , cannot discuss with Wahab matters which are of any s n ic ‘ c .11 :i A urgency* It is said in the telegram of 15th April that the proposed investigation of the sanatanum seora.* at this moment unnecessary and inexpedient- You will now understand that Wahab wanted the detachments pure ly as a reinforcement, though under the cloak of giving change of air to the men- Even under my original idea, no special investigations would be necessary. When a new sanatorium' is proposed the locality is always tested firstly sending a party of fairly healthy men to stav there through the summer, to see if.the cli- mate, water, etc, are really suitable- But my sugges- t ion.JCfTiO ArrJK vr ,£. j jy. r-rjrrr-r^ r r tion was very tentative and it was abandoned as soon as Wahab expressed an opinion against it* We are sending you by this mail an official letter from the British Commissioners with a map ; shew- / ^ t * v * ing where the boundary should be m their opinion “ and I enclose a cppy of a private letterwroxe to yucfc Barnes on the subject* I hady^then received the Secre-^ tary of State's despatch asking for Wahab's report on certain allegations; it is dated I think 4th-Apri but I have sent it^way to Wahab' s camp* Brom the en closures to this despatch I see that 'Wahab's line' is still being put forward as the limit of our claims / eU&gt; eu hJ+w (Jut- ^ and even I think spoken of^which has been tested* This seems to me rather unfortunate, as Wahab' s own testing on the Dthali frontier shows it to have no value at all, for that part of the border, and the line which he and Abud now formally recommend is a good way beyo nd it* I hope some means may be found of obtaining this further line* It would be difficult to surrender to the Turks the district of*- Ahmedi and other places between Wahab ’s line and what the Commissioners now declare to be our proper boundary. Could not the Commissioners be empowered to offer .to the Turks^when the demarcation commences^(2^5) or before it, corapensation for the strip of territory which is outside Wahab’s line, but which it is very desirable we should retain. I understand that it in cludes^ among other places, the Amir’s own lands in the Wadi Saf iya near San ah. It would be very awkward if ^ great part of the Amir's private property, as I under stand these lands are, were deliberately placed by us on the Turkish side of the frontier. tn^-rlLst —ZT ^ .

No. 263 Ely Lo^d:- With reference to my despatch No. 238 of the 20th ultimo I have the honour to enclose here with to Your Lordship copy of a telegram from the Turkish Military Commandant, Abdullah Pasha, to the Minister for War dated the 12th of May which has been sent to me by the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I consider that the information comimini- cated to this Government by Abdullah Pasha goes to strengthen the demand which I have repeatedly made that the Turkish Troops shall be withdrawn from the disputed lands pending the decision of the Delimitation Commission or a direct understanding between the two Governments. I shall again speak in this sense to Tewflk Pasha and remind him that The Marquess of Lansdowne, M. G., &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c..(Signed) N. P. O’Conor we do not recognize the Turkish occupation of Jelale, and that if the Military Commandant should he encouraged in his present intransigent attitude, a satisfactory settlement of the frontier question will be difficult without its entailing unpleasant consequences sooner or later for the Turks. I have, &amp;c # .Translation of Telegram from Abdallah Pasha, To Minister of War. The Sheikh of Dhali, who is for ever using all his efforts to seduce and excite to disturbance the frontier tribes, has with his men seized a tower called 'Dar ul Kabr', which dominates the district and which is the common property of the Seyyids of the neighbouring villages: this tower is situated in the village of Khair, which is between Lakamata Es Selah, in the neighbourhood of Kataba ,, Ku^rruku ,, (Custom House), two hours within the guard-house of Djelile, and the mausoleum of Hadji Veil Sayia. The warnings end advice given by the local authorities remained without effect and further on the 24th April (May 7th), prof it ing by the English incident (sic) which took place at Djebel Hadjaf (Sadjaf?), the Cheikh sent secretly more than a hun dred armed men, and ventured to seize and occupy the villagevillsge of Kheir. And as it was protatle that after a short time the disturbance and excitement would spread and the Custom House in the neighbourhood would be pillaged, and as there was not time to ask lor instructions, relying on the Imperial Irade with re ference to the question, I sent a certain number of troops from the guard-house at Djelile, and together with the Caime.cam of the 'caza', they proceeded to the spot end when the tower was about to he seized by the troops, the robbers without venturing to fire a single shot, profiting by the darkness of the night fled, and the peaceful inhabitants returned to their village, and reentered into possession of the tower: the matter was thus successfully ended, and the troops returned to Djelile: the above has been communicated to me by the Delimitation Commission. It is very unlikely that the Sheikh would venture on his own initiative thus to make aggressions, and therefore it is probable that his action is due to some other ceuse, and I have instructed the Commls- sionCommission to make e stringent enquiry.CONFIDENTIAL.

We have not been able to fix Lakmat as Saleh .exactly, but it is certainly much to the south of the position I gave it in the blue print y on which the red line and the yellow line were shown, so it is undoubt edly 5 or 6 miles inside the line.

The people are thus practically tied to their existing villages and fields, and though I have no doubt many of them would leave their country rather than be handed over to the Turks, it would be a very serious hardship* I will write fully explaining our reasons for recommending some advance beyond the limits shewn on the 1892 map. Our post leaves at three and there is no time to-day- v- mm Adsn, 29th May 1902 Many thanks for yours of 15th May- Yes there has been a lot of misunderstanding, and I am afraid . r have not got quite to the end of it- The map you kindly -fi-k d is a aheat of the 2 m. to 1 inch map, which we U'‘:f r - T ’ have,understood, rightly or wrongly, was not to oa ' j K referred to officially in this matter of the damarca tion.

As to this ^iruit, Wahah considers that his survey goes heyond Kata-a, and certainly the whole of the plateau up to Kataha is filled in, in the 4 m. to 1 inch map accompanying his report- The Toreign Office letter hT March 24th l fo Anthopoulo Pasha, was a great puzzle tc as, - S es Sir N 0 ’Conor also remaps is no line on the maps- i see this. The line on Wahah's separate map ( ^racing) ofI 3rd* Marcia 1393 has not been printed on any map believe, and I was under the impression it had never been shewn to the Turks* I am greatly disheartened at the v' 7 taken in the India Office regarding the boun dary line on the plateau* If it should be adhered to^ I fear the consequences will be little less than dis astrous* Hot only will the Turks be allowed to remain at Jaleli, but the villages to the west of Dthali which are actually in the Amir’s jToiyi Many and paying riiiri revenue, will be torn away* The last state of this ; omei would then be so much worse I fancy ne would endeavour to repudiaite his engage ments with us^ and would go over to the Turks alto gether. This would certainly not be to British in terests, or conducive to the safety of Aden* X much regret now that I ever compiled the printed note which I sent to Bombay with my letter 113 of 12th October 1901. This letter and the note had really much more to do with Beda, Behan, and the Aulakis, than with Dthali. I certainly was not Aline, to surrender anything, but we then all believed •that Wahab report was correct, and that the Turks wore, and had all along been in b ■’ lIL^Jlsse^siqn_ofthe cou? try to the west of fhp&gt; 'Mv,,-* •, t-e line shown on his separate tracingtracingof 3rd March 1892. I therefore said that this line appeared to represent .result of the Turkish agg^ 64 V ’ ■■vtyar'*- sion of 1373-78, and that it—was too late now-to re store to the present Amir--what had heen taken from his predecessor. But navies' report, which seems to me to have been fully confirmed in all important points by akab and Afeud, shews th at the R eport of 1893 was ab solutely wrong, and that the Turks were not m tr- . ■ session of the country at all. -he facts turned out to be totally different from what-*We had conceived them' to be; and if any part of the division indicated by the line in Wahab's tracing of 1892 is maintained, it will be, as I understand,__a case of taking ircm -ho Amir that which is actually his and handing it °ve. the lurks. This is obviously a very different ma„.er from admitting the claim of the Turks to country their possession* With regard to interests, I have i think no more desire to specially favour the interests ox Amir and his people than you have. But I find it. im possible to dissever them from our own. So far as ! can see, the interests of the Amir and British in- , . qvu A India Office says ' the terests are identical* -he maia . • _o-mtv o^ /den and not of main object in view is the safe ^ theths tribes”• quite so, but as against the Turks the safety of Aden and the safety of the tribes in our protectorate seeing to me very much the same thing* If it is an axiom that independence of the nine tribes A is necessary for the security of Aden, then we must see tha g fieir- ' rritdries remain practically intact* We cannot guard the outer line ourselves against the encroachments of the local Turkish officials; the tribes ■■ a r nnr 1 1 must do so* But to this end they must have a good line politically, and one which they can maintain* A line which breaks through tribes and sections cannot be maintained by the people, and such a line is likely to produce abundant trouble in the future* In fact I foresee that a strong body of levies or frontier guards is likel^ to be retired; whWereas A if the red dotted line of the British Commissioners could be accepted, the Amir would probably be able to 1 oox Uo. oer it himsell , with some assistance in the wp,y of rifles and arrnunition*tys 78 .—From Secretary of State to Hesident^ Aden, Qth June 1902.

The Viceroy* £ telegrams dated May 16th and : ay 26th indicated an external line of protectorate proceeding from Jebel jihaf to near f*ana and crossing the valley to the opposite rang s thus putting on our aide practically all villages between Jalola and Kataba.

The Turks cannot in my opinion be required to withdraw from positions occupied by them, whether formerly or rocu. ,ly outside the line indicated in Wnhab 1 s map of 1891-92 us explained in the telegrams to the Resident ,dated May 1 and Kay 23, and to the Viceroy on May 27. At • c^iaTIndia Office, Whitehall. S.W.77 .—From Secretary of State to Viceroy, Qth June 1902. P. —-A special Committee upon which the Foreign Office was represented has carefully considered the contents of your telegram of the 3rd June. The instructions previously issued by His M.ajesty's Covernment are confirmed and strengthened by a further examination of maps and documents. Any other line of procedure is incompatible icith previous communi cations to the Turkish Government. With regard to the points in your telegram, there is no difference between us as to Wahab's survey map of 1891-92 on the ^-inch scale ; and there is no doubt that the line has been understood by you in a sense different from that intended in our instructions, but there is no inconsistency in my telegrams. That to you of the Zlst January and that to the Resident of the 12th (not 13th) May both indicated the identical line which was described in more detail on the 13th and Tlth May. The difference arose because you traced a line, and understood that the shading justified you in so doing, across the valley from Jebel Jehaf range to the opposite side; whereas I followed a line which appeared to me to be the only continuous line justified by that map and the report by TVahab to which it was annexed, and which agreed so far as this portion of the country is concerned with JVahab's coloured sketch map of 1892. This line left to Turkey the Turkish villages in the valley. In the country from Alkama to Jebel Jehaf, however, I rejected Wahab's coloured sketch map, because the map of 1891-92 had been appealed to. In my telegram of the Tlth May and the instructions therein contained the line ice claim, and our reasons for not desiring to protect Amiris outside of that line, are explained. We do not think that there is any advantage in embarking upon a con troversy with Turkey about encroachments of which we have been aware for years, or even about those of more recent date on the Turkish side of the q/ 7 1891-92. It can be represented to the Turks that no admission of their rights over the Amiri tribes is implied by our restriction of our protectorate to only a portion of them ; and we shall be in a better position to insist upon the withdrawal of the Turkish posts on our side of our line if we are consistent in claiming the line indicated in Lord Lansdowne's letter of the 21th March. With regard to the country east of the line between Alkama and Jebel Jehaf, this boundary should be claimed at the outset as that of our protectorate at the present time, but, if a better line can thereby be gained, modifications may be made in accordance with the coloured map of 1892. This point, however, can be more fully considered when I receive the map asked for in my telegram of the 3rd June, showing the posts held by the Turks. That telegram and previous ones have now been repeated to Aden for the Resident's guidance. When Sir N. O' Conor arrives in a fortnight's time we can discuss the methods of securing the frontier we claim. Meanwhile he has strongly protested against occupation of the disputed districts. &gt; (ijlj28.— From Viceroy, dated 3rd June 1902. responsibility of repeating to Aden the latest instructions of His Majesty's Government is one which I am reluctant to take without giving an opportunity of reconsidering a decision which I believe to be entirely mistaken. The following propositions are established by a most careful examination of all the papers. In reality there has been no confusion as to the identity of the map. The map alluded to throughout has been Wahab's survey map of 1891-92 on the four miles to the inch scale ; but as to the interpretation of the so-called line upon that map there has been a serious discrepancy. You said in your letter to the Foreign Office of the Uh December that the basis of our claim should be Wahab s survey within the limits to which it extended. This definition was repeated in your tel ear am to me of the 21s£ January. I have since regarded our case as resting upon this ground. However, in your telegram to the Resident of the IWi Man you varied this definition, instructing JVahab not to cross the line shaded in upon our map ; but both the limits of survey and the shaded line have been ignored in your subsequent instructions. The limits of survey clearly include the cross Range in which peak 7722 is situated; the shaded line clearly includes the shaded range running due North from Jebel Jehafi This shading is nevertheless now ignored and you propose a line cutting right across it sweeping round Dthali Valley and leaving to Turkey not only all the places seized by the Turks since 1872, but many villages which at present undoubtedly belong to the Amir, but some of which have been occupied by the Turks since the meeting of the Commission In fact your instructions have reverted to the line traced in TVahab s coloured sketch map oj 1892, which in January you rejected, and to the line in the map which Maitland sent with his letter of the 12th October last which he has since cancelled I may add that the Turkish Commissioners on the spot are ignorant of and repudiate the shaded line. The position that we are only concerned with the status quo in 1891-92, when JVahab reported appears to be the justification of your attitude. But this position is, I submit inconsistent { yth the entire raison d’etre of the Commission and with the previous attitude of His Majesty's Government, Your letter of thelWi March last was repeated to the Turkish Ambassador on the 21th March; and m it . tfatpri the primary object to be a clear understanding as to the precise Ze TunnLfjZ feJnt recognised by His vdio'totl thp status quo* that is to say, your st&amp;tus opio was the existing status quo as determined by the recent reports and Maitland, m Tfafas these were consistent with the limits of survey m the accepted ‘ mil „nt the status QUO of 1892, as shotcn in Wahabs coloured sketch Z^’ fimfituTyoTJ rejected. The recent status quo which is 7uu described in Davies report of the \M November 1901 and m WahaVs letters of the 18tt and ZSrd April last is, however, ignored fnfuour latest ructions, which give up to the Turks the entire valley in whlhm November last only a small ^ f ^ ZZ ffef i ^ect ^the Amifof dLh. Surely this concession is maepenae J ^necessary and is also m contradiction to all our most unwi Moreover your instructions contemplate our claiming ProceepngsJit^ M^emo ^ ^ ^ o the w 2 0le fZAjZLrefZ tlyare inconsistent with the status quo of the Amu iy &gt; Wahah’s map having been throughout our basis, VshlZd be ZFZ TnS as Zf as and that it should be aanerea tunas when the Commission commenced, t Xr««r w««, *«, s. and not that wn c 1 vimih! this view prevail, some partition of ssx# #5 « 'to, compematel CmmMm, our appears to me to he n ° t J beq mning.

CONSTANTINOPLE May 20th, 1902 My Lord:- I spoke Loth to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and to the Grand Vizier yesterday on the sub ject of the difficulties raised by the Turkish local military authorities in connection with the delimita tion of the frontier of the Cantons round Aden. I based my representations on the ground of the Irade issued by the Sultan Instructing the authorities to proceed with the delimitation in a friendly and con ciliatory spirit so as to avoid any conflict with the British Commissioners and I insisted upon the Military Commandant, Abdullah Pasha, being compelled to comply with these orders. The occupation of dis tricts in dispute and still more any encroachment upon the territory of the Emir of Dthali such as had lately occurred in the neighbourhood of Jelale, was.I maintained, in distinct opposition to the Sultan’s commands and the assurances given to me hy the Sub lime Porte* Both the Grand Vizier and TewXik Pasha concurred as usual in the justice of my remarks but said that they could not without reporting my complaint to the Sultan send the categorical order I desired to the Vali or Military Commandant* The Foreign Minister undertook however to draw up a Memorandum which he would send at once to the Grand Vizier who would forward it to the Palace and request that he should be authorized to tele graph to the Yemen authorities not to allow their troops to occupy districts under dispute, to endeavour to mark out the frontier as shown in Colonel iVahab’s map of 1891-2 and to be most careful to avoid any conflict with the British Commissioners. The Grand Vizier hoped the Sultan would sanc tion this telegram but I have no doubt Abdullah PaSiia, who is a truculent as well as energetic of ficial, will represent matters in hie own way to thethe Sultan, and endeavour to evade executing the or ders ol the Grand Vizier, It however the reports that are current here he true as regards the general condition of the Yemen and particularly the district round Sana the Marshal may have his hands full in other directions and he glad to escape from the dif ficulties connected with the frontier negotiations. If the Commissions fail to come to an under standing on the spot it may he necessary, as a last expedient, to discuss the frontier with the Minister of War in the hope of persuading him to advise the Sultan to accept a line of frontier which will safe guard our main interests and he sufficiently per manent to prevent future dispute, I have, &amp;c..

These tracings should show the position of all such places as Mafari and others where Turkish posts have recently been introduced. When this has been done, the Turkish Government can be addressed firmly on the subject without fear of misunder standing. As Jo Jalela, I would refer yon to Wahab's letter, B. 44, of the Zrd March to tne Resident. The map enclosed in it shows Jalela to be April 18 letter is referred to in Durand’s letter to Bayley of the 21th [Copy of this telegram was sent direct to the Resident at Aden.]2 .—From Resident, Aden, Isif June 1902. P• TFaliab telegraphs on the ZOth May. “ With reference to the letter from the India Office to the Foreign Office of the 13th May, it appears to me to be absolutely necessary that the Turks should withdraw from places on the British side of the livie, especially Jebel Mafare, before any demar cation can be undertaken on the spot. The fact that it was occupied in the circumstances which I have reported constitutes a flagrant breach of inter national comity. The command of the route by Great Britain and thei'efore the evacution of Jaleli by the Turks are necessary to the safety of Aden. The occupation of Jaleli has been carried out in defiance of the protest concerning Bthali contained in Lord Granville's Despatch of 1883.” A further report from Wahab states that an aggressive attitude is maintained by the Turks, a picket of whom turned back his surveyors from the top of the Khureba Bass on the Tbth May. I entirely agree with his view that the Turks should withdraw from all their posts, including Jaleli, before demar cation is commenced. Referring to the last clause of my telegram of the 14^ and yours of the Ibth May, Wahab gives me to understand that the total Turkish force on Dthali plateau, including that at Rat aba, but excluding the escort and levy attending the Turkish Commissioners, amounts to about 800 men with 8 guns. In Wahab's opinion, a considerable force would be required to compel the retirement of the Turks from their posts. I will send a further report on this subject by letter; but for the present it will be impossible owing to the climate to move troops for some weeks at least. fin ^.

The line referred to as the * limit of the shaded portion in the surrey map of 1891/92 • i s I presume that shown In the accompanying sketch hy a bread red hand. The parts of this map south west of Jahaf are from recent surrey; the north ern part could not he surreyed owing to the opposition of the Turkish Coei-i issioners but I beliere that the course of th. Tiban is some miles further to the east than was indicated on the printed imp and that the discrepancy between the boundary which His Majesty's Gorernment wish to adopt and that suggested in my letter No 20 dated the 7th April will he smaller than it seemed at first , and if a balance he struck between the two lines hy exchanging the piece north of Ka'taba for that between Jahaf and the Tiban ralley, an equitable boundary would be obtained, recognised by everyone locally and representing the actual status. o. iiiQ limit of the 16 91 map is not as has I think been assumed a watershed or definite natural feature; the whole mass of JaJmf appears really to form a more or less broken but cultivated plateau ^covering several square mile* and contain ing numerous villages whose boundaries would require demarcat-ion in great detail if the line is carried as proposed; Even if it were practicable to lay down an arbitrary boundary on the ground-based neither on natural features or tribal limits, it would, I submit, be a constant source of trouble in the future, the Humedi and Ahmadi tribes would be left partly out side our border and would be compelled either to abandon a great part of tl:eir lands or become Turkish subjects/and the Turks would retain a footing on Jabal Jahaf from which they would undoubtedly continue the policy of intrigue and inter ference in the Amir’s territory which has caused so much mis chief in the past. 4. I have the honour to add with reference to the Secretary of State’s telegram of the 13th Thy thatthe British Coramigsionere in conducting their enquiries into the status of the Amiri tribes and the extent of the Amir’s territorles^were can-A irr; cut what they understood to be the instructions of His Majesty’s Government. In his telegram Ho 3? C dated the 26th November last His Excellency the Viceroy proposed certain instructions, mere especially with regard to the Amiri border, which necessitated enquiries into the actual circumstances, and his telegram dated 24 th January indicated that while the sur vey : -‘-s of 1691/92 were to be adopted as the basis of the demarcation, some latitude was left to the Corjfcissioners to a : nd that line by mutual agreement. These instructions thou^i not explicitly repeated by the Secretary of State were under stood to have been concuri-ed in by him, and the enquiries of the Commission were undertaken with a view to ascertaining how these instruction# could best be carried into effect, and certainly without any idea of extending the responsibilities of Kis mjesty’s Government beyond the limits of the 9 tribes the preservation of whose independence has been always under stood to he indicpensible. The expression used in Colonel Abud’s Memo: ' the future administration w of the protectorate was merely intended to refer to the political relations with the tribes and not to imply any more direct administrationthan is at present exercised* 5 ‘ As aoon aa t:iie Turkish Comnioaioners are prepared to cooperate, the joint Commission will aarch along the hordor and map the country through which the line of 109 2 passes.

C-B POLITICAL RESIDENT The SECRETARY to GOVERNMENT POLITICAL DEPARTMENT BOMBAY- With reference to the Secretary of State for India*a telegram of I 6 th. May, I regret to state that I have no snare Colonel Wahab has, so far as I am aware, made no olaim to any line laid down in the map of 1893* In the ordinary sense of the words no line was laid down on that map, and I think the allusions which have been made to the line “marked - or “shown* on the map, refer really to the line pointed to by 3 * The line olaimed by Colonel Wahab and Colonel Abud, as British Commissioners, is some wha t b ey ond this line, since it takes in the Tiban* The Commissioners* line represents the actual limits of the Amir's dominions at the present time. Of2 the Tillages within it I understand that none pay revenue to the Turks except the four isolated Shairi villages between Dthali and Eat aba, on whioh the local Turkish officials have wrongful ly retained a hold since 1873, notwithstanding that the Porte undertook to completely evacuate the Amir's country. 4. In another cover I am forwarding a letter from Col. Wahab with whioh is a map showing how the limit of survey boundary would probably be applied in demarcation to the actual ground* The differences are not great except that Colonel Wa hab takes his line north of Kataba* This place is certainly within the limit of the survey, but it has been a Turkish front ier pos j a long time, with lurkish officials, and a garrison and I do ndt see how we oould now claim the place for the Amir. Its case is not I think on all fours with that of the Shairi villages j and even for th^se I think we might offer oompensa** tion, if the Turks adopted an attitude which enable us to treat with them on a reasonable basis* 5 * I agree with Colonel Wahab that the •limit of survey* line,when demarcated, Is not likely to produoe a practic&amp;f/ or workable frontier, I fear that an arbitary line, drawn across a hilly, and somewhat thickly populated, country, WELlZwBt be sat isfactory. For the people seem by no means inclined to allow themselves to be disposed of without having their own say in the matter. They all prefer a state of independence under their own Sheikhs, and the Amir, to the harassing rule of the Turks, and so far from seouring a stable frontier, it appears not im possible that we might find that disputes would be more fre quent, and of a more serious nature, than they have been hither to* 6 . The note with maps attached to my letter No. 116 of I2th* October 1901 has been several times alluded to of late* I would explain that that note is &amp; mere compilation of the in formation available at the time it was written* With regard to the Amiri country, a great deal of what is there said has now turned out to be erroneous. For instance, Wahab's* report of 1891-92 and w tracing whioh accompanied his note No.44 B of 3rd Marchr- March 1892, war® naturally accepted as authorities for the boundary. I therefore said in my note that the line on the map accompanying it, ( a reproduction of Wahab's line) appear to indicate the permanent result of the Turkish aggression of I 873 - 78. It was further remarked that none of the Shairi villages were now in the hands of the Turks- Both these statements have proved to be incorrect ,and Colonel Wahab has formally repudiate his line of 3rd. March 1892 as in any way representtWthe actual and existing boundary. The slice of the plateau on the east ofl Jabal Jahaf then placed on the Turkish side of the line has never been in Turkish possession, except perhaps temporarily. ^ At least they have taken no revenue from it for many years,and all the villages pay to the Amir. The only villages paying to the lurks are those already mentioned, viz:- the four Shairi vilages Jaleli, Jelas, Lalehmat al Hajfar and A1 Wabh* I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant* Signed* P.J.

Ha was told that if he did so ha must at all haz ards avoid any conflict with the Turks, should they appear on tho scene, and that if he did com. into collision wit! we could give him no active support. This was on Wednesday morn ing last and Nasar immediately sent off some 85 of his men to the village• M.That overling it was roportod that some 150 to 200 Turkish aol- diors with 2 guns had left Jalola. Messengers were immediately sent out to ascertain whero this party was going to. Next morning ( Thursday the 8th May ) information was received that the Turks had gone to Laima t al Sal ah and had destroyed the Amir’s fort ( its garrison having escaped in the night) with artillery and had burnt another house in the village and had looted or caused to be looted 25 head of cattle and six camels. Lt Colonel Abud and Major Tod were at once sent over to Jalela to ascertain from the Turks the truth of this matter and if admitted to protest most strongly against the whole proceed ing which had talcen place in territory tnen unc.er discussion by the Commission and against the wanton destruction Ox oh® property of our ally the Amir. On arrival at halela the Chief Commissioner Colonel Mustafa Bomzi was reported to bo sick and the party was received by the second Commissioner f Lt Colonel Ibrahim Coin, who admitted that Turkish troops had been cant to LrMmat al Salah and tiiat the Amir’s fort had bean destroyed. Tie however denied that the cattle had haon looted. Later or. In the conversation ho artd that the fort had not heen destroyed hy the Turkish soldiers, on which it was pointed out to hte that no matter who had actu ally destroyed it yot it must have t&gt;een done with the sanction of the Turkish Officials who were present at the time and that reparation would ho demanded for this act. e -rstifiod the action hy declaring that the village was Turkisn and that as far as they were concerned there was no dispute as to its ovm- ' or ship, nor indeed to the ownership of any territory in the vicinity of .Talela, though it was pointed out to him that the Anir's accounts produced hefore the Commission showed that he had received the revenue from the village for years past. Lt Colonel Ibrahim Seifi was informed that the has is of the Brit ish claim was the * inch map of l89l/% and that this map had been shown to the Turkish Ambassador in London who v;as there-fore well aware of the claim made by us and that consequently the action of the Turlcish officials In exercising authority in the Tillage in question was contrary to all precedantiwift-- usually obtaining when Boundary Commissions are sitting and further that we were well aware that the Turkish Governmont had expressly forbidden any action likely to give rise to any incidents between the Commissioners of the two nations and that such action as at present complained of was calculated to dis turb the peaceful solution of the work of the Commiseion and that the local Turkish officials 3iad therefore exceeded their orders in the action they had taken, Lt Colonel Ibrahim Seifi admitted that such orders had been received, but declared that as the village in question was, at all events provisionally, in their occupation they had the right to maintain order in it. He was reminded that the village could hardly be Laid, to be even provisionally in Turkish occupation seeing that it was held by the MrAr* r garrison which had been obliged to vacate the pl*ce under ressure from Turkish troops. It Colonel Ibrahim Soifi denied any knowledge of the map of 18 91/92 or that his Government were aware that it v/as the basis of the British claim. A reference to hi a Government was there fore su -gested, to which he assented. It Colonel Ibrahim Seifi was then told that our Government had declared their intention of maintaining the lino as shown on the map in question and that should the Commission be unable to agree to a boundary on those lines, our Government would be obliged to withdraw their Commissioners and to maintain the frontier &amp;e they viewed, it# lie was also told that these views had been communicated to the Turkish Amoass&amp;doi in Lon don by letter dated 26th March last# then proposed as a nodus vivendi that our respective s should remain where they were pending decision of the points at issue and that neither should interfere in occurrences that might take place between Arabs alone. After considerable dis cussion It Colonel Ibrahim Seifi absolutely refused to accept■ L I ^ thie or any othar proposition which tended to limit the exer cise of Turkish authority v/ithin the line they eiaim. 'c also declined a proposal to jointly map the country in question. Lt Colonel Ahud therefore concluded the interview hy making a strong protest against the aggressive manner in which Turkish troops are moved about in disputed territory, while we on the contrary confined the movements of our escort to oountrywhich is admitted by the Turks themselves to be on our side of the line. This morning ( 12tl huy ) the Amir* s con reports that the Turku are pie venting people from crossing cither way •hie line they have arbitarily drawn south of fcwlela across the Dth&amp;la plat eau.

We are telegraphing to Aden for precise information, hut our present view of actual boundary, as shown on Wahah’s map, published in 1893, is that it runs along the shaded mountain range from A1 Khama north-eastward to Jebel Jihaf, then turns south-east leaving Wady As Safiya on its east to the Turks, almost as far as Ad Dthala, which is on the British side. Thence it runs north passing close to A1 Jalel so as to leave the Safiya Valley, including Jalas Minadi and Sana, to the Turks. The line turns due east again near A1 Hakl.

With reference to the telegram from the Secretary of State, Rated 10th May, the village of Lakmat Assalah, where the Amirs fort was 'destroyed by the Turks on %th May, lies about five miles inside the line filled in by tracing of hills in map of 1892. The Turks visited on the same day another village, Fhiharan, eight miles inside this line. Here they imprisoned ■a Sayad, who was subsequently released on payment of 30 dollars. The Amiri inhabitants of these villages took refuge at Hthala. A cordon has been established by the Turks across the valley south of Jaleli; they are stopping all traffic and treating as their own the country to the north. The Secretary of State's suggestion, in his telegram of'lth May, that demarcation should be conducted by the British Commission alone, is impracticable. The Turks intimated, at an interview on &amp;th May, that they would resist any attempt to cross this line, and our proposals for the joint survey^ of disputed country were rejected. No progress is possible until reparatiori has been demanded for the outrage at Lakmat Assalah, and until the Turkish posts have been withdrawn from Jaleli, Mafare, and Jucyph (sic), all within the dine claimed by Ms Majesty's Government. gp 5-0 Gm tyy lr'1 /K- y i166 .—From Viceroy, \§th May 1902. P. —Before receiving your telegrams to Aden of \{)th and 13th May, I had sent on 10th May the following telegram to the Resident, Aden, with reference to yours of the hth and 7 th instant:—“It is understood here that Colonel Wahah is desired by the Secretary of State to delimitate up to the limit of the shaded portion of the map accompanying his report of survey U891—92. This would appear to give TVahab the more important part of the line he recommended in his letter No. 20, of the 7th April last, to the Foi'eign Secretary, including all villages in Wadi Safiya, up to Jabal Jehaf at any rate. The line would follow the watershed from this point instead of extending to the Tiban River; the Mehrabi, Mafari and Azraki country would remain to the Amir of Dthali, but he would lose the Ahmedi and Numedi tribes, unless you claimed to extend the line to the limit of the map, thereby including Amara and Rumar, and were then able to exchange these for the Ahmedi and Rumedi line suggested. This line might start from the peak (73D5feet) north-east of Kataba, and, if it ran across the valley south of that place to the nearest point of the opposite range, it would exclude Al Jalela from Turkish territory, and leave on Amiri side all the villiges claimed by the Amir between Jalela and Kataba.” These suggestions are in agreement with your instructions, but while Turkish posts are far in advance of the line proposed, and the Turks continue their aggressive attitude, it is difficult to -demarcate this line, which may possibly also include the Ahmedi tribe. Your intention to ask the Foreign Office to demand of the Turkish Government the immediate withdrawal of all Tu?'kish posts on our side of the 1892 line, including the post at Jalela, has my cordial support. v^ 1U- CONFIDENTIAL S~Q NO of 1902.

Cornmiss loner Aden Boundary Commission TO The Secretary to the Government of India Foreign Department Sir With reference to my telegram of this date, I have the honour to report that the Turkish Authorities are attempting to collect revenue from the Amir’s villages in Habil A1 Suk arid Wadi Safiya, which have hitherto always paid regularly to the Amir and from which the Turkish Commissioners did not attempt to prove any taxes had ever been paid to their officials* 2* I reported a few days ago that they were also try ing to coerce the llumedi trice who have hitherto resisted ag- K ressionsand who were subject to the Amir of Dthala. Unless the Porte is induced to put a stop to this action on the part ’ J of their local officials, the Amir and his people must inevit ably lose confidence in our assurances of support, and it willoe very difficult to prevent their taking action in their own defence which would place the Commission in a very emharassing ■^position. I have explained in previous letters that though in military occupation of A1 .Talola the Turks have never collected revenue from the Amir's villages to the north, where they are now interfering, that these villages have alv/ays hitherto re- cognised as Amiri hut that by the recent extension of their outposts they have made it impossible for the Amir to exercise his adialnistEative rights over the part of his territory in question.

April 1902. £ir &gt; 1 have the honour to forward a Memorandum by Lt.-Col. ^bud discussing the probable effect of the adoption of the bound.* ary recommended by the British Commissioners in the tribal ter- i ritory adjoining the border. n suggesting this boundary the Commissioners have necessarily been mainly influenced by the evidence produced by the Amir, and by the Turkish Authorities in support of their respective claims, but the effect on the future of Aden ought also to be borne in mind, and Col. Abud’s long experience i n the Aden Residency gives considerable weight to his opinions on this point* I have, etc*IC^ORA M on some OTHER ASPECTS of the BOUimARY. 'fa The line of demarcation^ix.d &lt;»rhy .the British Commission- •™ &gt;»• 20 iprll . sketch map showing the boundary is annexed thereto. The British ^ Commissioners were influenced in their consideration of this b ° Undary b7 P ° lltical &gt; 'atural, tribal and geographical consid erations. But there are other considerations which must, I think be present in the mind of an officer who has served for as many ' years under the Aden Residency as I have done, and though it may be no part of my present business, yet I trust that it may not be considered improper if I give expression thereto. ^ U ' Th9 fir3t ° f these oo^iderations is the future administra tion of the country that may be fixed by this Commission a s within the sphere of British influence. T n the first place I hardly think that it can be argued ( t tat the Aden residency has been well served in the past by Uf ' T ative Assistants,for it would appear from enquiries made by the British Commissioners,necessarily indispensable in carrying out their work, and from documents placed before them in due course, t.tat instead of being of little importance and possessed of lit- -j-e or no influence the AMIRS of DTHALA have been the Chiefs of a confederation of trioas able, when occasion demanded,to raise an army some 5,000 to 7,000 strong. Speaking for myself the impression left on my mind by the reports of the late Native Assistant of the position of the AMIR of BTHALA was as I have stated it and this view was in some way supported by the small ness of the AMIR’S stipend viz:- 50 dollars per annum, and I have no reason to suppose that other officers took an£ differ ent view. What the object of the Native Assistant was in doing so can only be surmised from his dismissal from the service and the reasons that necessitated it, but so much is, I think, cer tain that had the /4den Residency had a just conception of the position of the AMIRS of PTHALA their complaints of Turkish ag gression would undoubtedly have received more consideration than they have done, and a great deal of the present discussion thus avoided or minimised. Ever since 1873 the AMIRS of UTH&amp;LA have complained bitterly and constantly of Turkish aggression and the Aden2 Aden Residency -Wing received through H. M' S . Government the promises of the PORTS to abstain from such action, have never ascertained in a certain and sure manner that the promises of evacuation have ever been carried out by the local Turkish Of ficials. The consequence is that at the present day we find that the Turks occupy positions in the very centre of the AMIR': territory and n virtue thereof now claim the whole of the AMIR: villages to the north of AL and also tribes and terri- ies wi-n whom has been connected for centuries to the west and south-west of DTHALA itself, as well as to the east a n d north-east. The AMIRS of DTHALA are not pure Arabs, but are stated to be of MA¥ALAD descent. They have thus no tribe and consequently there is no such tribe as the AMIRI. The people included m this term are a number of tribes banded together under the AMIR of DTHALA for mutual support and protection. Ho important and powerful were the AMIRS under the IMAMS that their territories and privileges extended far beyond the present claim made by the British Commissioners and included KATABA itself and a large stretch of country westward of that town and also cer tain payments and privileges at DAMAR, TAIZ, MAFIA, IBB, and ’. -, all situate in YRMTH PROPER. The British Commissioners have however excluded these from their consideration and have contented themselves with the boundary named* The tribes with in this area forming the AMIRI confederation are the SHAIRI,the EALMIM, the XOTSBI and RADRAH tribes, the ASRAXI, HSLTARI, MIHRABI and HTMFIDT tribes, the AHL JAHAP and the people of a considerable number of other villages* Of the ten tribes men tioned the Turks claim all but three in addition to nearly the whole of the villages* They have absolutely no valid claim to any one of them and the tribes themselves have never acknow ledged Turkish supremacy* These tribes have never before sought British protection as it has been understood by them and the whole countryside that they were included under AMIRI, and thus already under British protection. Seeing the advances the Turks have made in their direction since the AD DARTMA affair, these tribes have directly petitioned for British projection* -his is well known to the Turks and if they are eventually left beyond our3 our frontier they are well aware what they may expect as a con- sequence of their pro-British attitude. They are and always Ol.terly opposed to the Shirks vdio have in years past at tempi i-ed without success to coerce^but have never succeeded in f0rClnS them t0 pay them avenue. If therefore these tribes are left with the Turks it may be expected that some or all of them will come into conflict with the latter and the proximity o f border will afford them every opportunity to attack the -arks and then cross into our protectorate. There will then follow complaints from toe Turks and a constant source of dis pute will be engendered, and to prevent such occurrences it is possible that we shall have to maintain garrisons all along the border. hardly think that H. M's- Government desire such an eventuality, which in my opinion must be inevitable if the line now proposed by the British Commissioners is not adhered to* On the other hand the line now recommended will ensure the peace of the border as all tribes who have accepted Turkish rule will remain on the 1 urkish side ■while the tribes desiring British protection and who belong to the AMIRI confederation will re main on the British side* Thus and thus only will it be possi ble, in my opinion, to maintain a peaceful and satisfactory frontier. There are other aspects that should be taken into consid eration in fixing this boundary* One of the most important of these is the trade of Aden* It must be an object to all con cerned with Aden, to save,if possible, the trade which is al ready suffering from the competition of JIBUTI, the full effect of which has not yet become apparent* One way to do this would be to open up the trade of the port with the interior of Arabia* ITow a considerable part of the trade of Arabia is centred in the coffee producing districts of YHRTSU* To effect any improvement in this direction the heads of the passes leading from must remain on the British side 6f the frontier* The line now recommended effects this object, ■while any other line must leave the control of the passes in the hands of the Turks, an oppor tunity which they would not lose sight of to discriminate again#? all trade going to Aden in the endeavor to divert it to their own ports of MOCHA and HODARDA. There are practically only four convenient4 v * (?) convenient roads by which Aden can be approached by caravans from mCElT, namely, the HARD ABA route descent to which is by'' the KUHRBA NAKIL, the VAS^KRA route, the route down the TIB Ail and the MAFALIS route through the SUBSHI country, the laSt of whicn leave out of consideration for the present, as is u ^ lately affected by the line under discussion at t..is point of the frontier. At present numerous roads converge on these passes from the interior which on account of their number the Turks cannot effectively control. Their object there- l oi ~ to push tneir frontier as far forward as possible so as to secure the heads of these passes and thus be able to discour- age trade going to Aden and to encourage trade to use their own ports* Once the heads of these passes become recognised Turk ish territory, the ri urks will inevitably erect custom houses at the head of each of these passes and thus the whole trade o f ^den with will come under any rules and regulations the Turks may choose to frame, or must be diverted to the Turkish ports. ITow the boundary line suggested by the British Commision^ ers achieves the object in view and the heads of these passes are included in the British sphere of influence, but o nly just suff iciently so and consequently any retrogression from the line recommended must place the heads of these passes in the hands of the Turks* In days to come, and perhaps these are not so distant a s may be supposed for enquiries are already being made on the sub ject, it may be that a railway will be built to connect Aden with YEMEIT* How it is more than probable that the only feasible line , for such a railway would be along the TIBA TT T . r A ’ which a p- prcaches the highlands of Y15MEH by a fairly easy ascent* . ne boundary line now proposed secures that the most part of this valley up to where it emerges from the highlands of YWiF, i s included in the British sphere, the advantages of which are ob vious* Any narrowing of the British sphere means that the con trol over this valley becomes more and more contracted and it is very imperative and desirable that this should not take place* Moreover want of water would probably be experienced by any other' line of railway while the TI3AN gives a constant and perennial supply of good water* Anotherin 5) Another efiect of accepting the line proposed by the Juries would he to put out of consideration the proposal to have a muc' a much needed sanitarium for British soldiers on the DTHALA plateau, as tne acceptance of that line would constrict the portion of that xess for the purpose, and even if it were not so, its then prox imity to the frontier would most certainly militate against its adoption and would render such an establishment undesirable* It would therefore appear that from every point of view the • line now proposed is not only reasonable but absolutely essent ial for the peace of the border, the development of the trade of Aden an£ the health of the troops, and to accept any other line would seriously discount the advantages of any settlement of this question* DTHALA, Sd* H* M* Abud, Lt*-Colonel, 25th* April 1902* Indian Staff Corps* plateau in the British sphere to such a small area as to be use-fiw 6 (s Telegram to R esidentf Ad3n&gt; foreign Secret.

The red line indicating boundar y of Amirs territory, is on an average 15 miles beyond, and the limit of Jt r ahab s survey of 1893 is nine or ten miles beyond, the yellow line, up to which it is evident that the Turks have taken possession of the whole country. JVithin it they are behaving as though they are masters. JVahab's appeal (?) is, as I understand, that in addition to remonstrances Turks may be required to withdraw all troops except the Commission escort, and all posts (sic), armed Arabs, from the country indicated in above limits. It appears to me derogatory to His Majesty's Government that a Commis sion should sit powerless within yellow line, and situation should not be prolonged. I hope, at the same time, that His Majesty's Government will not accept withdrawal from demarcation, which would be equivalent to defeat.aCONFIDENTIAL. No. 7/ of 1902.

Snd March -Despatched letter No 7 (Secret) reporting the appoint* ment of the additional Turkish Commissioners. The Turkish Commissfoners arrived at the hour named, and the Commission held its second meeting. The former two Turkish Commissioners were accompanied by Lieutenant-Colonel Haki Bey and Khalil Effendi, who took their seats for the first time, and it was explained that the third officer nominated was absent owing to indisposition. The Turkish Commissioners were informed that no notice from our Govern ment had yet been received regarding the appointment of the additional Com- missioneis. The proceedings of the first meeting were then read, in which the purposes of the Commission were defined as being to delimit the boundarv between the Sanjak of la iz and the nine tribes. We took exception to this definition, and proposed that the wording should run as follows : “ To delimit the territories of the tribes having relations with His Majesty’s Government and the dominions of the Ottoman Emperor.” The Turkish Commissioner said that their instructions did not permit of such definition, and that this point must be referred to their Government. The record also contained a statement that we admitted Jabal Jahaf to be Turkish. As this was incorrect, it was erased from the minutes after some discussion. The proceedings were then signed by the Commissioners who had been present. The Turkish Com missioners then produced six firmans bearing dates from 997 A.H. to 1031 A.H. appointing a Sheikh of the Shairi tribe, also a number of receipts for payment of revenue alleged to have been made bv the Shairi Sheikh between 1301 and 1307 A.H. It being late, the Commission adjourned till 2 p.m. on the 5th instant. 4th March 1902 .—Received a document from the Amir, dated 1270 A.H., in which the Shairi acknowledges the Amir of Dthala as their Chief and Ruler. Also another document from the Sheikh of Ka’taba acknowledging the Amir of Hthala as his Chief and Ruler and agreeing to pay him $150 annually and half the proceeds of the market at Ka’taba, dated 1277 A.H.

A few shots were fired at the party, and, seeing that he could not carry out his object peaceably, Major Tod decided to return to bead-quarters, and did so next day. 25th February 1902 .—Lieutenant Tandy and party arrived in camp.

Colonel Wahab refused to admit that these countries were in dispute, seeing that the Turks had never even been in them, had never occupied them, and that the Sheikhs of the tribes in question had asserted their entire independence and denied having ever been Turkish subjects. Ibrahim Seifi replied that these countries were included in the civil district of Jahaf. Colonel Wahab pointed out Jabal Jahaf from the tent door, and showed Ibrahim Seifi that the countries alluded to were far to the south of Jahaf, and that the Azraki country commenced within a few hundred yards south and west of our camp, and said that, if his contention were admitted, Dthala would be almost entirely surrounded by Turkish territory, and this was also pointed out to him on the map. Colonel Wahab further said that, until after our arrival at Dthala and two days before the arrival of the Turkish Commissioners, there had not been any occupation of Jabal MafaTi, which lies between Jabal Jahaf and the countries now in question [ see letter No. 1 (Secret) to the address of the Resident, dated 11th February, and diary of instant]; that he felt sure that this encroachment had not been made with the knowledge of the Turkish Commissioners, but that it was due to excessive zeal on the part of the local officials; and that he could not consent to withdraw our surveyor unless the armed party of Arabs were simultaneously withdrawn from Jabal Mafa’ri. Ibrahim Seifi then repeated the claim of the Porte to the whole of South Arabia based on its conquest by Sinan Pasha some 100 years ago, and, in reply to our assertion that the Imams of Sana* were the actual sovereigns of the country from the date of the expulsion of the Turks in A.D. 1630 to the reconquest and establishment of a Turkish Government at Sana’ in A.D. 1872, he denied that the Porte had lost its sovereignty, and refused to admit that there had been any interregnums. We stated that this was the point on which we had already differed at our previous^ meeting and which had necessitated reference to our Government. The interview then terminated. 23rd February 1902.—A report was received^ that Muhammad Nasir Mukbil (the man who was the cause of the Ad Dareja incident) was threateningthe Ahmadi and Humada with punishment if they gave any assistance or information to us or showed any disposition to hecome tritish subjects.

It contains information received from thr Ami.oif,? regarding a rising of the^ Arabs in Yemen against the Turks, the former h“tini a it is saidj obtained certain successes. 135 I have reason to believe that the Sultans and Sheikhs south of Sana still cherish the idea of the restoration of the Imam, and that some of them at lea are plotting to that end. O what is going on in the neighbourhood of and beyond, we have no information. There was a report some months ago hat a Turkish detachment, or convoy, marching in the district of Taiz 1,ad been attacked and dispersed, but we never received any definite information regarding this incident. As far as we can discern, there are no si^ns of anv general rising against the Turks being likely to take place at present in the part of Yemen adjacent to our Protectorate. The attitude of the Turks on our borders seems to be generally aggressive. I have been informed tbafc they are threatening Radman, a district between Radda, which is Turkish, and the small State of Beda. Colonel Wahab informs me that the Turkish authorities are putting pressure on the people of the tracts in dispute on Amiri part of the frontier, or some of them; and I also understand from him that Muhammad bin Nasir Mokhbil, our opponent in the Addareja affair, is still influential in the Taiz district. All this would seem to indicate that the Turks in our neighbourhood are under no apprehensions as to the security of their hold on the country. If there have been serious disturbances in northern Yemen, Government have doubtless heard of them from other sources. Very Confidential. Statement of the Amir of Dtliala made at Camp Dthala, the 26th February 1902. On the 1st of the month Ramadan A. H. 1319 I sent a letter concerning religion to the Imam of Sana by messenger, to whom I paid $30, and he returned on the 25th February 1902 with a reply and the following information. The Imam Sayad Muhammad Hamid al Din, whose official title and signature is “ Abdilleh al Mansur ” Billah, lives at Kaflat Adar. His only son, Sayad Yahia, lives at Al Madam. Both these places are westwards of Sana. All the villages to the north of Sana are now in the hands of the Imam. About two months ago the Imam (?) some of his troops to the district of Haja, lying to the west of Sana, and after heavy fighting the Turkish troops retired to Sana, and at the present time only the town of Imran, about half a day’s journey from Sana, is in possession of the Turks. The Imam is well supplied with ammuni tion, which is guarded by 1,500 men, and daily money is being sent and in return ammunition is being received. I saw about 250 sons of Sheikhs who aye kept with the Imam, and it is said that their fathers have undertaken to join the Imam after the coming Id with forces estimated to number 200,000 and with 1340 F. D.v . •4 nir-iTi/ifiminriiiiinn these forces the Imam intends to attack Imran and Sana. The Imam is also employing 60 men daily coining money (I have in my possession a piece of this money called Buksha, forty of which go to the dollar. It is a silver piece bearing the official style and title of the Imam H. M. A.). The Imam is i n JC possession of large numbers of horses and mules. One of the Imam’s Lieute nants named Mohsin, Mughdad, is stationed in the Balad al Cones, and about a month ago the Imam sent him 1,700 men. Mughdad marched with these men to a place near Jabal Lauram, where was a Turkish garrison. Mughdad divided his men with seven detachments. The first of these he launched against the Turks, and, being unsuccessful, 25 were made prisoners and beheaded. He continued sending detachment after detachment to attack the Turks, who eventually retreated losing 400 killed, all their ammunition including the ammunition of one gun which they saved, and a quantity of mules and stores. The Turkish troops retreated to a village at the fort of Jabal Dauran, where they are now besieged by Mughdad. This happened about six days ago. Even villages in the hands of the Turks now pay tithes to the Imam. Prayers are now said in the Masjids in the name of the Imam, and not in the name of the Ottoman Sultan. The Amir of Dthala informed me he was thinking of doing the same thing. The information of the messenger was confirmed by him personally. Before me. H. M.

It seems evident from these papers that the Porte and its higher officers have acted m good faith, but that orders, repeatedly given, have been disregarded by the local officials for their own purposes. And I would venture to suggest that, as the Turkish Government has not so far committed itself to any occupation of the disputed territory, hut has, on the other hand, consistently ordered its local officers to abstain from encroachment, it may still be possible to avoid any further inconvenience by insisting on the orders already given being strictly carried out.

The Commissariat Contractor’s man reported that he had gone out to buy Karhi for the camels, and whilst on the road running past the Turkish post at Karba four men had stopped him and threatened that, unless he returned, they would ^ fire on him, and actually pointed their rifles at him. The Turkish Commissioners were written to on the subject. The Amir of Dthala came and said he wished to go to his village of Lakmat al Shaab, as he was in want of food and he had a quantity of grain stored there, and he mentioned that a few days ago he had sent some camels to bring it in which had been turned back by the Turks. In view of the fact that the Turkish Commission had deliberately stated that the village in question did not belong to the Amir, we told him that we would give him an answer after meeting the Turkish Commission on the 13th. 12th March 1902. —B-eply to our note of yesterday received from the Turkish Commissioners, but not being satisfactory, they were again addressed.

In all your reports or telegrams regarding disputed places you should state whether they lie within Wahab's boundary line. As to reinforcements to Commission escort, please see my telegram of \hth April, by which discretion is left to you ; but, since we have told the Turks that we consider the line marked in 1892 as our frontier, there should be an end of unrest and misunderstanding if our party keeps resolutely within it.

The Minister asked for time to speak to the Grand Vizier and promised to let me know the re sult as soon as possible. I have also pointed out to the foreign Min ister the hopeless delay which must ensue if the Turkish members embark upon historical and political considerations in bringing forward their case, in stead of dealing with it simply, as we had always intended to do, by drawing a lino in accordance with the de facto limits at the present time of the res- Isl 0 I*-* pective spheres of influence of the two parties.

His Majesty s Government have, and exercise, a Protectorate over nine tribes in the neigh bourhood of Aden, and in respect of these tribes' they have never contemplated, and would not now assent to, any inquiry as to the origin and basis of their Protectorate. Secondly, the external frontier of these tribes, where it touches the Turkish dominions or spheres of control, has not been delimitated to the mutual satisfaction of both Governments. A part of this frontier has, however, been carefully surveyed and traced by Captain n a hah in lb91-92, and the line was shown in a map annexed to the Report of his smvejy Jhis map has been referred to in the course of discussions which have alreadv aiisen between the two Governments. The line laid down in it has always been icspected by the British authorities in the absence of any other line jointly accepted by the two parties, and it is not unreasonable that His Majesty’s Government should hold to it themselves and expect their neighbours, in their turn, to respect it pending an agreement on the subject. The line is, however, not complete. It does not extend along the whole of the confines of the Protectorate, and where it fails to settle disputes His Majesty s Government have been obliged to ascertain the status quo and to regulate their action by the light of any inquiries that may have been found to be necessary in each case of dispute as it arose. Thirdly, it is the case that encroachments and aggressions on the territories of the nine cantons have occurred in the past, either owing to ignorance of the line traced by C aptain Wahab or, where no line has been marked, owing to want of knowledge of the facts. His Majesty’s Government have no desire to increase the area of their Protecto rate, but at the same time they are unable to permit their existing Protectorate to be violated. They assumed that the Turkish Government were equally anxious to main tain their own rights and to respect the rights of others, and in these circumstances they [1901 aa-~l\ 3 J3 1 . , ,, , T . h Governments should desire to arrive at a clear under considered it natural that both ^ ov ^ e i , standing as to the line wh * cl 'TuAish^Minister for Foreign Affairs in his communica- / The proposal made by the T )o!ntment of a Joint Commission to demarcate tion of the 25th October, 1901, fo , PP r, d yii a y e t of Yemen was therefore-.y the frontier between the 'IfyG^nmentfas X informed your Excel- onVeToth October, and a similar communication was made to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople. • fc 0 f the Joint Commission, I Such being the origin and 0 f His Majesty’s Govern- have the honour to inform ^ ur ,/ p Aj | ^ teg ^ to begin by accepting as it stands the ment) l;toa:;ba,:Tft e Br!tish botetf to accohing' to t'he map tfaced in 1891-92 P e n n C? wthab wherever that map is available, and elsewhere according to recog- by Captain \\ ahab \ he f tino* boundaries of the nine cantons.

If, in addition to the attainment of this object, the Delegates could agree unanimously to an improved alignment, an additional gain would be secured. , . I have the honour to request that your Excellency will be good enough to explain these views to the Turkish Government; and it would be a source of much _ satisfaction to His Majesty’s Government to learn that the Turkish Government concur m them, and that they will instruct their Commissioners accordingly. I must add, however, that if the Commissioners should he unable to submit unani mous recommendations for the improvement of the frontier, His Majesty’s Government will have no option hut to continue to maintain the status quo on the frontier of their Protectorate.

I, The aim and object of the Go mils si or as proposed b e stated ir the first Protocal W Lt- Col. roraliim Selfi acting as Secretary to the Commission are to define the boundary be- tween the Sanjak of Taiz and the nine tribes. I dojnot rightly knonr what the expression Sanjack means but probably a province is meant. The nine tribes are of course the nine tribes under the protection of the British Government. I think this definition of the aim and object of the Com mission is objectionable for two reasons, first, because it is not in accordance with our instructions which entrust us with i UJN* '‘ / the mission of settling the north western boundaries of our ^ Protectorate in Southern Arabia and the territories of the Port$ which in my opinion is a very different thing to defining the boundaries of a mere province and nine tribes only. Secondly, because the expression 'nine tribes' will be used to mean the nine tribes we have alwaysjc on tended for and nothing more and thus unless we can prove that many of the smaller tribes which cannot be included generically under the nine tribes are subject to one of the nine tribes they must fall a fortiori to the Turks notwithstanding the fact that they disclaim all allegi ance to the sultan. Bor have they 6'zrer paid tribute to the Turks who in some cases have never even entered their countries. If this definition is adhered to it will force us to prcjye that these tribes form part and parcel of one of the nine tribes Lb and'this, is doubtful if Y/e can do^ Purther our instructions direct us to obtain if possible a natural boundary rather than a tribal boundary. Bow the prox&gt;osed definition entirely puts aside any chance of obtaining a natural boundary to say nothing of confining us strictly to the nine tribes. I think that this definition is not by any means accidental but is proposed with the objects which I have stated. In fact I think that this view is borne out by the Turkish Commissioners first claim , namely, the whole Shairi tribe, Bow although we have always considered that this tribe comes under the head of Amiri and the Amir of Dthala held responsible for any disturbance caused by them on 1 is I A 6 i the2 &gt;. the caravan road, yet I hardly thinh that they could strictly he included as belonging to the Amiri-* one of the nine tribes. That they are allied to the Amir is undoubted but I doubt much if they could be claimed as generically Amiri and I think that the proposed definition has this in view and was expressly framed in the form proposedfor this very puriJose. Undoubtedly historical sequence includes this tribe in the Amiri territory or rather in the territory administered by the Amirs of Dthala. And this condition of affairs obtained until the disputed suc cession of one of the Amirs of Dthala and the intrigues that * his rival entered into with the Turks and which directly caused the advance of the Turks south of Kataba and gave then a foot ing in the basin formed by Jabal .Tahaf on the west,&lt;Tabal Mures and the Shu r aib mountains on the north and north east and Jabais Harir, Eaim^in, and Shairi on the east. In furtherance of this we have the following documents but as they cover other tribes it is as well to mention them here. The other tribes included in these documents are the Shu’aib, The Shairi, The people of Jabal Jaliaf represented by the chief family the Zendani, The Mafa'ri, The Azraki, The Mehrabi, The Anara, The Hamada, and The Ahmadi. Except the Shu r aib who are Yaffai, it is doubtful if any of the others can be claimed as generically one of the nine tribes. In support of his claims the Amir of Dthali has produced the following documents which can hardly be anything but genuine in view of their dates and condition and the ab sence of any notice that he would be required to produce them. I. A document dated Rajab A.H.

In addition to these documents the Amir has produced his accounts for the A.H. years 1310 to 1318.

Revenue derived from the Hafa^i, Hamada, Ahmadi and Mahaiba tribes is also shown as re gularly collected during the nine years covered by the accounts.

Waliab sends following telegram for transmission to Secretary of State for India :—“ Commission held first meeting at Dthali, 11th February. First point discussed was boundary between Kataba and territory of Amir. Turkish Commissioners thereupon claimed whole Shairi tribes of Jabal Jahof and Mafari as belonging to district of Kataba. They based claim on firman granted by Porte to tribal chiefs, and on actual administration. Evidence collected by us negatives assertion of actual administration. Turkish Commissioners assert that all Southern Arabia belonged to Sultan of Turkey prior to British occupation of Aden, and that British only obtained Aden after asking permission of Porte to establish coal depot there, and that Amir and chiefs now under British protection hold their country under authority of Turkish firmans. Turkish case in present delimitation apparently rests on similar firmans, and if their validifyis admitted our whole position in Southern Arabia becomes untenable. Progress being impossible until this point is decided, Commission have agreed to refer to respective Governments and await orders before meeting again.” It would appear that instructions given to Ottoman Commissioners include specific renewal of Sultan of Turkey’s claim to suzerainty over whole Southern Arabia, which British Government have repeatedly refused to acknowledge.

It will be observed that General Uaitland considers that the surrender to the Turks of villages outside Tahab's line which are now in the possession of, or pay revenue to theproposes that com Amir of DThali, would have a bad effect; and pensation should be given to the Turks for such villages eithe m money, or by assignment of territory elsewhere. I am to say that the absence of any definite information as to the - number and value of the villages, it is difficult to decide whether the course proposed by General M aitland should be adopted or not; and there is no indication of the direction in which it would be possible to provide territorial compensation The Turkish Commissioner^., m%y prove more amendable than Genl: Maitland anticipates, and it is understood that there are some villages occupied by the Turks inside Wahab's line, which may be set off against Amiri villages outside the line.

Additional instructions have now been sent to Major Davies m accordance with the Secretary of State’s telegram of 1st November 3; With regard to the gift of the flag to the Amir of Dthali, by the late Native Political Assistant, it has been the custom to give flags to the Chiefs whose territories are on the sea-board, and these flags are displayed at their sea- coast towns when steamers happen to arrive. Rut I cannot find that flags have been ever given to inland Chiefs, except in this one instance, and in this case I imagine the Native Assistant acted on his own responsibility, and without the the authority of the Resident. 4. I should be glad, however, to have the orders on the subject, as the lurks are said to be distributing flags to any Sultans or Sheikhs on their frontier who will accept them. There would perhaps be no objection to British ags being occasionally granted to Chiefs of inland territories, together with written instructions to the effect that the flag is only to be displayed at the Chief s capital town, or in its immediate neighbourhood, and that it is on no account to be hoisted at any village, or on any piece of ground, the posses sion of which is disputed.

Now you may consider, sir, that the whole cause of this disturbance has happened through your servant, and thus offence has been given to us, and to the British Government, by the seizure of the flag and the breaking of the flagstaff, and by our subjects being put in prison and being made to suffer severe and cruel beatirg. I hope, therefore, that you will enquire by which of your servants the information was given, as these territories are our original nossession, and are under our Government, and m the hands of Amir after Amirs who have ruled over them. As to the Turks, it is true tliat they had previously taken all the places advancing until they got as far as Baha, a town of the Haushahi, and put Amir Ali Mukbil into prison but by the glory of the British Government, the said Amir was released from prison, and all his territories were freed, and the followers of Amir, who are loyal to the British Government, were relieved of fear of the Turks. Now, sir, if such news reach the Turks especially through your servants, they will be encouraged to be more daring. We are very sorry for the taking of the flag and the stall. So, if we are permitted by you to contend with them on the subject, we shall do so, otherwise not. Hoping the favour of your kind reply to what we have said herein, with warm respects to your honour. Translation of an Arabic telegram addressed to His Honour General Maitland at Aden, dated Sana, the 23rd October 1901. The Dthali Sheikh has expressly acknowledged in a paper which he sub mitted, and (which) was sent to the Government of India See the letter of Monsieur Schneider, one of your predecessors, dated 19th March 1875. It is in two parts and was given to the Sublime Porte by the British Embassy at Constantinople. (It states) that the division of Zorki, and Ahmedi, and Mahrabi, included in Mahlaf Hedjaf, subordinate to the district of Kataba, are not, and never were, a dependency of Dthali. We have learnt with regret that the Sheikh referred to is interfering in the said division, and we inform Your Excellency that orders have been given to the officers and troops to protect the rights of the (Turkish) Government, and to prevent the inter ference of the said Sheikh in the above division. We therefore request you to restrain the Sheikh from this encroachment, which conflicts with the relations subsisting between the two Governments and is opposed to (our) rights and covenants.

Dated, Aden Residency, the 29th October 1901 (Confidential). Fiom Brigadier-General P. J. Maitland, C.B., Political Resident, Aden, To Major Davies, First Assistant to the Resident at Aden. You are deputed with the permission of the Secretary of State for India to enquire into, and report on, the state of affairs as regards the boundary between the territory of the Amir of Dthali and the Turkish province of Yemen. 2, You are also to ascertain the actual facts as to the alleged tearing down of a British flag at “ Wara ” by Turkish soldiers, and if it is the case that a British flag was actually set up at that place by the Amir, and forcibly re moved by the Turks, the Amir should be called on for a full explanation of his action, and especially for a statement of the grounds on which he claims Wara.^ Whether his claim in this instance admits of justification or not, you will give him the strictest instructions to avoid interference with places in Turkish territory, and it is obvious that the British flag should not be hoisted on debateable land, though it might be properly exhibited on the Amir’s own house, or castle, on the approach of any party of Turks, or on ceremonial occasions. 3. The present dispute appears to have arisen not only as regards Wara, hut with respect to the three small districts of Ahmedi “ Zorbi,” (Azarik or Azraki ?) and Mehrabi. These we understand comprise the strip of country at the eastern foot of Jabal Jahaf, immediately between it at Ad Dihala, and theralleys to the south and south W of ^ Yrlbf ? “SThiS the map, and it is shown there 0 villa o£ A hmedi, is marked on the map may possibly he the most no S there is I)0W a Turkish about a mile west-north-west of Jalel., where ^ ^ ^ Another A i Wa ra list and it may have no actual existence ^ 4.

It is further desirable that we should know what revenue v-o vrioiriari hv t.hp^P district, s and other places the possession of which is m dis pute. 5. The Secretary of State’s permission is conditional on your not going beyond the frontier. That is to say he desires that you will not go into Turkish territory. The boundary of course is not demarcated, but for the pur poses of this order we must assume it to be as indicated by Major M ahab in his survey report of 1893. 6. So far as we are aware the actual boundary is still much the same as it was at the time of Wahab’s survey and no Shairi villages appear to be now paying revenue to the Turks, According to Wahab, the Turks are only on the western side of the Amir’s territory. It should be accertained, if possible, whether they have obtained possession of any of the Shaibi villages to the north-east; and if so, whether the Shaibis have altogether lost their independ ence. The Upper Yaffai tell us that their country joins the Amir’s, which apparently means that they come up to Jabal Harir on the east. We ought to know for certain if this is the case, and also what are the relations of the Yaffai with the Shaibis. 7. It is very important that we should be informed whether the Turks are interfering or have recently interfered, with the Kafila road after it passes into the Amir’s country, or with the villages in its neighbourhood; and particularly whether they have established, or attempted to establish, a post at Al Khureba, or anywhere near the place where the road descends from the plateau towards the plains. 8. You are aware of the dispute between the Amir and the Turkish officials regarding a fort or tower at “ Kharaba.” The Amir built a place which the Turks destroyed saying he had made use of materials collected by them for the purpose of building a fort of their own. In March last the Amir reported that the Turks were going to build a fort there, within his limits, and he repeated this in July. The place is described as being on a hill “near Ash Shafi. ’ He also talks about the district of tc Ash Sharaf.” In September Amir bhaif again wrote about this fort, or post saying that the Turks were determined to construct it, and that the place was in the midst of his territory and nearNo. 8677, dated Bombay Castle, the 13th December 1901 From J. ^Acting Chief Secretary to the Goveroment of Bombay, To The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department transmitting™ cop^of^lSfor^Davie^ renoi f ’ ^ ‘^^Decetnber ^01, of the Azraki, Mehrlb? and « the Sheikhs mission 6 ^ n0w be determined “by ' B^ndty^Co^ Accompaniments to the letter to the Government of India, Foreign Department, No. 8m dated the 13th December 1901.

Moreover, as I have already pointed out, their position renders it highly desirable that they should be on the British side of the frontier line. ,, A . The third letter is from the Mafaris, and supports Major Davies’ report that this district belongs to the Amir.

We paid what was due by us to Amir i and Muhammad Musaad, and afterwards to Amir Shaif whom we follow and are under British protection”. When they heard this from us they sent us a deputation of Arabs.

Your most obedient humble Servant,CAMP AL DTHALA 8th November 1901•- My dear General, I have not written since we were at Ai Kafla as I have had no news. Last evening and this morning I had a long talK with the Amir about affairs here. Regarding the hoisting ci the British flag at Al Wara he says that the village is his, that it pays revenue to him and that the Turks have not occu pied it ior years. The hili on which the house was built and which was demolished by the Turks is called Kharba or Ash Shafi the latter after the name of the Wall whose tomb is at the North East foot of it. This hill the Amir declares has always been in his possession and 'ne utterly denies that he used sto nes and other material collected by the Turks in the erection of the house. Yesterday morning and this morning I went to the village of Kabar from which a good view of the villages of Al Wara and Al Jaleli can be obtained also the hill Kharba, if Ja~ bal Jihaf is taken as the Western boundary of the Amir’s terri- t«r„ then all the above places are in Amirt/ territory, but ac cording to Wahajfc* they are Turkish. The Amir does not stat« that Al Jaleli is his, but he says that the Turks retained it after the former Amir v/as released by the Turks. Quite recently, within the last month the Amir says the Turks have encroached on the Amir’s territory and have taken possession of Jabal Shahad which commands the caravan route which passeb near Khureba. Jabal Shahad is about f mile N.N.E. of Kabar and the Turks have a small garrison there and have thrown up entrenchments, these latter can be seen distinctly from Kabar. The Amir never reported this matter to us and on my asking him the reason he said it was owing to his absence that it v/as not done. He further stated that the object of the Turks in possessing themselves oi Jabal Shahad was to erect a .tort or it and t© interfere with the caravans. I must make further enqui ries about this matter as it is a serious one. I have arranged t© meet the Kai Mukam of Kataba to-morrow morning west of Kabar and •and shall see what he has to say about the Jabal Shahad inci dent cvs well as about A1 Wara and Kharba. I shall make a full leport regarding all the natters mentioned in your letter of instructions to me. I think we shall probably start to return to Aden on Monday next, the Ilth. The climate of this place is verv pleasant, the nights are very cold and one requires two blankets over one. Roth Annesley and I are very fit,he has his camera with him and has been able to take some excellent photos of the places in dispute. • Hoping you are well. Yours Sincerely, SD/- J. Davies.CAMP AD DTHALA My dear General, 9th lT®vember I90I»« ^ ^ Ka^ Mukurn si Kataaba met me this morning ta the N * w * 1 ; : e vm *Ge of Kabar. I first ©f all asked him regard ing the complaint of the Amir that the house erected by one of his subjects ©n Kharba had been demolished by the Turks . The Kai Mukam replied that Kharba was in Turkish territory and that | ^ been in oheir possession since the demarcation of the K boundary ( by this I understand him to mean since 1875 when All I bin Mukhbl1 w *s released by the Turks and his territory resto red t© him ). As regards A1 Wara - on my questioning him the Kai Mukam said that the village belonged t© the Turks as shown in their books. I then asked him how it was that the Amir had col* lected the revenue of the place for so many years past with the knowledge of the Turkish Authorities at A1 Jaleli ; and they had raised no objection* He denied that the Amir had received the « n revenue and added that it had not been collected by the Turks never^’aii*' 01 ' the 1 * st seven y« ars owing to failure of the e**ps. in these As to the alleged encroachment of the Amir in the jr s • Districts cf Mehrabi, Azraki and Ahmedi I asked the Kai Mukam ii this was true* He laughed and said he knew nothing about the matter, but stated that the Governor General ef Yemen had sent intimation to the Resident at Aden that Turkish Troops were pro ceeding from Kataaba to these Districts which he said were Tur kish* I asked if the Turks collected revenue in the above men* tinned Districts and he gave a similar reply to what he gave regarding A1 Wara, viz: that the revenue had not been collected for seven years as there were n© crops* Many arabs of the above named Districts are here and Abdul Rab has learnt from them that no Turks are at present in those places and have not been there since Ali bin Mukhbil was released. These people say that if the Turks do g© there the inhabitants will certainly fight them*It is curious that the Governor General ©f Yemen in his telegram t© you should have stated that he received infor mation that the Amir v/as interfering with the tribes in the abofre named three Districts and intended encroaching upon the territory when the Kai Hukam says he knows nothing about this matter. Prom whom could he have get his information, or was it ©nxj a make up ©n his part as a pretext for sending troops in that direction ? I told you in my yesterday’s letter that the Turks had within the last month encroached upon Amiri territory and ©ecupied Jabal Shahad. I asked the Kai Mukam about this, he replied that it was Turkish territory, that there was a garri son cf 50 men there and they had been sent there because it. was more healthy than A1 Jaleli. On my incjuiring by whose orders the troops had been sent to Jabal Shahad the Kai Mukam replied that as he was a Civil Officer they could not be sent by his order, but by that of the Officer Commanding troops at Kataaba, then he said he knew that the hill was in Turkish limits and _ that the troops were sent by his order and that of the Officer Cernmanding troops Kataaba*. On my saying that the hill was un- vLi doubtedly in Amiri limits he said he could not order their with- drawal without reference to the Governor General of Yemen. I think this matter should be reported to CGovernment^by wire as it is a most impertinent proceeding on the part of the Turks* I mentioned to the Kai Mukam that the Amir had com plained that his subjects were molested by Turkish soldiers when proceeding from Ad Dthala to Al Hussain via A1 Jaleli. He denied this altogether and said that Al Hussain was Turkish not Amiri territory. He alse said that Al Khureba as well as all . i- Shairi villages belonged to the Turks. He added that he had heard that an official from Constantinople was to be sent to re- present the Turkish Government ®n the 0©mmissicn shortly to meet to demarcate the boundary between Turkish and Amiri ter ritory. He informed me that he would report to the Governor — GeneralGeneral if: Yemen the subjects cf ®ur conversation, the interview then came to an end. As regards the Shairi villages the Amir teld me yes terday that only four sf them, viz:- A1 Wabh, Jalas, A1 Jaleli and Luknah A1 Hajfar ( N. of A1 Jaleli ) were under the Turks all the others were independent. Now that they know .: a Bound Commissien is about to meet the Turks will probably encroach and grasp all they can • I have no more news.- Yours Sincerely, SI)/- J. Davies*i i A.L KAPLA, 12th November 1901• My dear Oeueral, We left Ad Dthala this morning and arrived here at xG g* clock- I saw the Amir last evening and warned him against encroaching on Turkish territory ©r interfering with their sub« jects in any way# This was really quite unnecessary for he ap pears te be in mortal fear of the Turks! I asked him for in** formation about the Ma’fari District which lies north of the Mehrabi# He told me that previous to 1875 the greater portion ©f the Ma*fari District was in t?ie possession of the Arair of Dthala and in that year the Xcnir purchased the remaining portion for 180 from the three Sheikhs Yehya Hassar Hedeyan and his two nephews Qhalib bin Ahmed and Abdulla bin Ahmed. Since that time the Amir has ruled the District. Yehia Hassan Hedeyan died some time age and now the two nephews above named are the Sheikhs of the District. Recently, about a month ago, the Turkish Author i. e. the Kai Makam of Kataaba wrote several letters to Grhalib bin Ahmed asking him to go to A1 Jaleli, finally went^and the Kai Makam told him the Turkish Government would, appoint him Sheikh of the Ma'fari District if he would collect the revenue for them. After he had been threatened several times he consented.

MAITLATTD^ G.B., Political Resident, Aden The SECRETARY to GO^RHItFlTT B 0 M B A Y • Sir, I have the honour to forward herewith a copy of Tfaj or Davies’ report regarding the “boundary of the Amiri country, and the reported removal of the British flag at Wara village. It would appear that the “boundary indicated hy Captain Wahah i n 1891-92 and which we have always regarded as indicating with to lerable accuracy the actual limits of the country in possession of the Amir of Dthala and of the Turks, respectively, is really quite unreliable, and that the actual state of affairs on the plateau was, and still is, not greatly different from that des- c “by Major Hunter &gt;ars earlier on page S' 7 ' of his ”AC- COHFFTS OP THE ARAB TRIBES IB THE VICIHITY op ADETT”• I think there can he little doubt that before the early seventies, 'when the wave of Turkish aggression began to approach the borders of the Amiri district' the whole of the plateau on the west side, up to the crest of labal lehaf was ruled by the late Amir, and that the places now possessed by the Turks on the east side of this range are the Amir’s b: r right, but were wrongfully retained by them when Amir Ali Mokbail was at last restored to his state on account of British remonstrances. 2. I understand that the only villages on the plateau actually paying revenue to the Turks are Jaleli, where they have2 a 1 ,Talas t0 the north of it, A1 Wabh to the north of Jalas, Lalrhrnat al Hajfa half a mile southeast of Jalas. All the - &gt; except the few Shaft! villages and a ^roup of three 0wned by the are paying to the Amir* The Turks have no maps and seem to lay claim vaguely to numerous places they have never teen In actual possession of* 3# :iaj or nun ter unfortunately says nothing about the val leys south and south west of J abal Jfthaf, hut it is difficult to see what right the Turks can have to Azraki, Mehrahi and Ahmedi now claimed by them. These places are stated to have belonged to the late Amir, and the Turks do*not seen to have ever occupied them, or taken revenue from the people. As a matter of fact the present Amir does not interfere with Ahmedi, Mehrahi and Az raki, which are at present independent, and it would really seem as if the complaint of the Governor General of Yemen in his te legram of 26th October (forwarded with ny Fo. 12?, of 15th Foverr - oor) was made with a view* to establishing a claim to these dis tricts bef O're demarcation commenced. Husen Hii lm i Pasha has ap parently been instructed to take action on an admission in one of the enclosures of a letter from General Schneider, dated 19th March 1875, which was subsequently communicated to the Porte. This paper is a report from Amir Ali Mukbil showing how the Turks had sent troops marching through his country and the Sheikhs and people submitted through fear. The last places they visited before returning to Ka’taba were 'Johaf Mehrabi and Ahmedi”. After ’'Ahnedi” the words '(country not belonging to the Amir)' are inserted in brackets i n the Pnglish transla t ion . They do not occur in the Arabic original, and are not the Amir r s words, but a remark by Saleh Laffer, the Fative Assistant. Pven supposing that the people of Mehrabi and Ahmedi (Azraki is not mentioned) were then indejiendent of Amir Ali Mukbil, as they are now of Amir Shaif Saif, there is no admission of any kind by the chief, and it would appear that the Turks have had no footing at all in these places for upwards of twenty years. The people are so unwilling to pass under Turkish domination that Major Da vies was informed that they would resist an attempt to take3 revenue from them fay force* The Turks are no doubt aware that they would have considerafale difficulty in getting anything out - s r.icts in question, and as the revenue to fae derived f for- cannot fae an important sum, they would perhaps agree to surrender their claims for a consideration. 4. It is important to us that the districts should fae on our side the line, as they flank the Amir’s country In a very awkward manner, and if the Turks established posts there it wou fae hardly possible to prevent them from annoying the Amir’s peo* pie in a variety of ways* It is probable that there would he continually recurring disputes and the state of affairs on the Amiri border would be little more satisfactory than it is now* Besides this, the district of Kafari, which would seem to be un doubtedly the Amir’s, Is beyond Aaraki and Mehrafai, almost at the back of Jabal Jahaf. It is difficult to see how we can surrender this bit of territory, to which the Turks would seen to have absolutely no claim. 5* The conduct of the local Turkish officials in endea vouring to coerce the Sheikh of Mafari into giving up his alleg iance to the Amir of Dthali, after the question of a formal de limitation of the frontier had been raised, appears to me to be very reprehensible. Still more serious perhaps is the occupa tion of the small hill Tafaal Shafaad by a military post with artillery. This place would seen to fae without any doubt in the territory of the Amir and its recent occupation an unprovok ed aggression against which I trust His Majesty’s Government will offer the strongest possible protest. In my humble opin ion the troops should fae withdrawn from J afaal Shafaad as a preli minary to demarcation. 6. I venture to think that we should aim at a boundary running from the peak of Jafaal Jahaf south south-westwards along the hills, the peaks of which are marked on the map, 7394, rrn ?3, 7131, to the Am Amma range, and it seems to me so very desirable to obtain this hill to stop further encroachment and disputes, that4 X. that I think we .night pay any reasonable sun to the Turks for sacn rights as they nay he considered to possess over the coun try thus placed on our side the boundary, or if this is imprac ticable/it might perhaps be possible to give them territorial compensation in some other part of the border. unsatisfactory nature of Wahab's boundary arises, I think, iron the fact that he was unable to cross into, and hardly able to approach, Turkish territory, or country claimed as such. For demarcation purposes a large scale survey of the ground on h: tn sides of the supposed line appears to be indispen C\ sible, and this survey should get well ahead before the actual work ot delimitation commences. I have heard nothing yet of a Survey party but presume one will be detailed. The existing maps are not only on tpo small .a scale for demarcation but they do not cover enough of the country through which the line of the frontier runs. This is noticeable at several points, but i-&gt;ar*« ticularly on the coast and along the Amiri part of the frontier. ' On the coast our western limit is that of the At iff 1$ a section of the Subaihi tribe. The boundary is somewhere west of Has Arrah, but the country has not been surveyd and Has Arrali itself, an important point, is not included in Wahab’s survey. 8. From the coast, the line runs in a general north east erly direction to the neighbourhood of Eaftaba about 100 miles in a straight line. Fast and north east of this there is no survey and we are ignorant of the features of the country. But it seems obvious that the boundary should be demarcated for at least some distance further, and I strongly recommend that the survey should be carried on along the northern border of the Upper Yaffais and the limits of Feda and Behan until it strikes the great desert. Beyond this point it is probable that no demarcation is necessary though we might require to have an un derstanding rgarding rights to wells and pasturage in the desert. 9. Government are aware that all the people immediately east of the Amiri country, that is to say the Sheikhs of the Uppernave Upper Yaffais and the chiefs and Sheikhs of Beda and Behan cone in and asked for treaties and British protection. I would ( strongly urge that such treaties should he concluded before de marcation is commenced. I have the honour to he Sir Your most obedient servant (Signed P. J.

MAITLAND, C.B., Political Resident, Aden* Carap MUSEMIR, 15th November 1901, In accordance with the instructions contained in your confidenc.ial let er dated the 29th ultimo*, I have the honor to inform you that I arrived at Ad Dthala on the 5th instant and commenced to make enquiries into the state of affairs as regards Ad- the boundary between the territory of the Amir of Dthala and the A Turkish province of r emen* The only map which in any way shows the above mentioned boundary Is a tracing from the Survey Sheets made in 1892 by Captain Wahab^R.D, / On the Turkish Authorities complaining that his survey party had encroached upon Turkish limits. This tracing as stated by Captain Wahab in his letter No, B/44 Confidential, dated the 3rd March 1892, to the Resident Aden, shows approximately how the border runs, but in.as.much as the port ion to the north and north west of Ad Dthala shown as Turkish territory contains the following Amiri villages, viz :~ All the villages in the Wadi A! Safia district which extends from Habil-Al-Sud to Habil A1 J a lab, Khauber, Minadi, Lakmah Salah, ShAib Al-As-Sud, Daiiabi, Saraf 7 , Dthi Hirran, Ash Shaeb, A1 Waara, A1 Rabat, Aul Burned, Dakka, Dar Rahban and Dar Amana, the boundaiy^ shown by Captain Wahab must be regarded as quite incorrect. The Amir of Ad Dthala claims all the above-named villages on the grounds, (l) that they were in the possession of his pre decessors and ancestors, (2) that all the people now residing in them*then are either his relati date he was elected Chief ives or subjects and (3) that from the ' &gt; up to the present tine he has ruled ' ° Ve * tiiem and has collected revenue from each of them. During a conversation I had with All Ismael Raza, the Kaim Makati of Ka f tana, on the 9th instan^he informed me that the Turjih claimed all the Amiri villages, north west and north of Ad Dthala as well as all the Shalri village, hut he could not tell me the grounds on which they claimed them. As regards the alleged tearing down of the British fla^ hy Turkish soldiers at A1 Wa’ra, the Amir stated to me in an in— terview which I had with him on the 8th instant that A1 Wa’ra is an Amiri village, that it is inhabited by his subjects, that he receives the revenue and that since the time he has been Amir it has never been in the possession of the Turks. He admitted th&amp;t the British flag had been hoisted in the village by one of the subjects and that it had been stealthily removed during the night by some Turkish subjects. The Kaim Makam of Ka'taba stated to me on the 9th instant that A1 Wa’ra was a Turkish village, but in reply to my question as to whether the Turkish Authorities re ceived the revenue of the village he said that no revenue had been collected by the Turks for the last ? years owing to fail ure of the crops. From enquiries which I have- made I learn that A1 Wa'ra is inhabited by subjects of the Amir only, that he receives the revenue and that there has been no failure of the I had a second conversation with the Kaim Jfekam on the 10th ins tant, but he was very reticent on this occasion and on my asking not answer any of my questions without first referring to the Governor General of Yemen. is ; situated to the south west of Jabal Jihaf and is shown in Captain Wahab’s tracing above referred to.

The Turks have had a small garrison at A1 Jaleli for the last 2:0 years * In Captain Wahab r s tracing the territory of the Azraki Mehrabi and Ahmedi tribes is shown as being in the possession of tne Turks In 1892, but from what I have gathered from men of these tribes it appears that the Turks have not been in thvcJT neighbourhood for the last 23 years when a fight is said to have taken place between them and the tribes and they withdrew to Ka’taba. The Amir informs me that although the three above- mentioned tribes were formerly subjects of the Amir of Ad Dthala they have during the time he has been Chief been independent, that he receives no revenue from them, but that there is an un derstanding between him and them that they should assist him in case he: has to fight against any other tribe. The Kaim Makan informed me that these tribes are under Turkish protection, but that the Turks have collected no revenue from them for 7 years owing to there having been no crops I have ascertained that the land belonging to these tribes produces good crops yearly and that there has been no scarcity for years past* The Turks have recently endeavoured to lyrin^; the Ma f farl tribe under their protection. The greater portion of the Ma*~ far! district was in the possession of the Amir of Ad Dthala previous to 1875. In that year he purchased the remaining por tion for ft 180 from Yehya Hassan Hedeyan and his nephews Ghalib bln Ahmed and Abdulla bin Ahmed, the Sneiklis of the disti icu* Since that time the Amir has ruled the district* About the commencement of last month the Kaim Makam of Ka’taba sent three letters to Ghalib bin Ahmed calling to A1 Jai.eli* He went there and the Kaim Makam told him that he would make him Sheikh of the Ma'farl district, if he would collect the revenue on hehal( of4 (W) of the Turks* After much persuasion and threatening he con sented, hut when the Amir’s son heard of the natter (the Amir was in Lahej at the time) he forbade Ghalih to collect any re venue whatever* The Amir has now summoned Ghalih to Ad Dthala and intends keeping him there. b. I was most careful to^ keep within Amiri limits during my enquiry, and neither I nor any of ny party entered Turkish limits or any disputed ground* o* I have in paragraph 1 given the names of the villages which are shown in Captain WahaVs tracing as being in Turkish limits and which the Amir claims as his, also of those in Amiri limits which the Kaim Hakara of Ka’taba states are Turkish. The following 4 Shairi villages are now in possession of the Turks, viz: Wabh, .Talas, Lukmah Al-Hajfar and A1 Jaleli, There are no Turkish troops in Wabh, .Talas and Lukmah al Hajfar, a Sheikh has been appointed over these villages by the Turks and he col lects the revenue on their behalf. A small detachment of Tur kish soldiers has been stationed at Al Jaleli for the last 2 0 years. All the remaining Shairi villages with the exception of Al Khureoa, which is under the Amir, are independent. The Turks have not obtained possession of any Shaibi villages to the north east, this tribe is still independent and is ruled by Sheikh All Askir, the Chief Sheikh of the Upper Yaffai. The country of the Upper Yaffai extends as far as Jabal Harrir, the tribe also possesses 3 villages to the north west of that mountain, viz :~ Kxiaraoa, Shaka and Khalla. The relations of the Upper Yaffai with the Shaibis are good. 7. The Turks have not recently interfered with the Kafila road after it passes into Amiri territory, but they have within the las t month^ during the absence of the Amir, encroached upon his territory and taken possession of Uabal Shahad, a high hill t mile north east of V/abar and commanding the Kafila road* They have posted a garrison of 50 soldiers on the hill, have thrown upup entrenchments on its summit and mounted 2 guns. It is said that they intend erecting a fort there-* I questioned the Kaim Makam regarding this extraordinary action on the part of the Turks, and he replied that the hill was Turkish and that 50 sol diers had heen sent there as it was more healthy for them than in A1 Jaleli. On my asking him hy whose orders the soldiers had heen posted on the hill, he said that as he was a Civil Of ficer he could not give such an order, hut that it had heen giv en hy the Officer Commanding troops at Ka’taha, he then added that he knew the hill was in Turkish limits and that hoth he and the Officer Commanding troops at Ka’taha had given the order* I said that the hill was undoubtedly in Amiri limits, to which he replied that he could not withdraw the soldiers without an order from the Governor General of Yemen* I afterwards asked the Amir why this encroachment hy the Turks; had not heen at once reported to the Resident at Aden, he replied that it was owing to his absence in Lahej that this had not been done* 8* Kharba is a small hill about mile north west of the village of Kabar and according to Captain Wahah’s tracing with in Turkish territory. The Amir informed me that the hill be longs to him as it is surrounded by Amiri villages and that the house built on it by one of his subjects which was demolished by the Turks was not built of materials collected by the latter* The Kaim Makam told me that the hill was Turkish property as it was w/ithin their limits. The Turks do not appear to have- any intention of erecting a fort on Kharba. 9* Kharba is also called Ash Shafi because the tomb of Wali Ash Shafi is erected on the north east foot of it. 10, With regard to tobacco smuggling_the Amir denies that his subjects smuggle tobacco into Turkish territory. He states that traders from Turkish districts are in the habit of purchas ing tobacco in Aden, carrying it through his territory and thence/ into Turkish and that he cannot prevent this. He states thathe once mentioned this matter to General Creagh and asked him whether he should stop the practice, hut General Creagh told him he could not do so. I have, etc., (Signed) J.

Lee-Warner. Aden, 6th November 1901. My dear Lee-Warner, I am exceedingly glad to hear that the Porte has proposed a joint demarcation of our mutual boundary in South Arabia. If this demarcation is carried out, it will greatly simplify our position here, and will enable us to contemplate things, e.g, the establishment of a sanatorium, which are now outside the range of practical politics. I am also glad to see that, tempting as the Porte’s proposal appears, His Majesty’s Government are not embracing it too eagerly. I suppose I shall have an opportunity of expressing my views before anything is decided, but perhaps there will be no barm in my telling you briefly what has occurred to me in connection with the proposal. In the first place, it is very desirable that we should have a survey of the “ zone of demarcation,” that is, the strip of country in which the boundary lies, on a larger scale than any of the maps we now possess, and this survey should extend further to the north east than Wahab’s maps. I think one inch to a mile is the smallest scale useful for demarcation purposes, and of course the more important bits of country should be examined personally by the Boundary Commissioners or their assistants. I was with the Afghan Boundary Commission of 1881-86, and have, therefore, had some little experience of these matters. I presume the Turks will agree to our carrying out the survey, and will accept the work of our survey party. No doubt a clear understanding will be come to on this point before tbe business is started. If the survey party were to arrive here this cold weather, before the end of January, they could begin at Ras Arab, on the coast, and work north-eastwards along the presumed frontier, taking in as much of the country on each side as was necessary, until they reached the high land of Dthali, which is on the main plateau of Yemen. The distance from Ras Arab to Dthali in a straight line is about 100 miles. By this time the hot weather would probably have commenced, but the climate of the plateau, at an elevation of 4,500 or 5,000 feet, is understood to be such that work could be continued without interruption. If things are not settled in time for the survey party to reach Aden before the end of January, the work had better be put off till next October. I am inclined to think that, in any case, the actual demarcation should not commence until the survey had got some way ahead. I should like to point out that tbe demarcation should not stop with the territory of the Amir of Dthali. East of his country lies that of the Upper Yaffai, then Beda and Behan, and then the Upper Aulakis. I am sorry I have no map to send you. I made a sketch map on a small scale and sent it with my letter and report to the Bombay Government. I hope it will be reproduced at Simla, or tracings taken. You will, however, find the above names, though not very correctly placed, on the War Office 10 miles to one inch map of 1893. We have no treaties or agreements with the Upper Yaffai and the Upper Aulaki, though we have with the Lower Yaffai and the Lower Aulaki. Nevertheless the Yaffai without distinction, and similarly the Aulaki, are included in the “ nine tribes ” which have always been within our sphere of influence. We send presents to the Upper Aulaki, and the Upper Yaffai trade with us. It would be most unfortunate if either tribe were to fall under the domination of the Turks. Between the Upper Yaffai and the Upper Aulaki is the chiefship of Beda and the small district of Behan-al- Kasab, which is independently ruled by certain “ Sharifs.” Beyond Beda and Behan and the Upper Aulakis is the great sand desert of Arabia, which stretches eastward past Hadramut, to the confines of Oman. It is an effectual barrier, and cuts off the tribes occupying the comparatively narrow belt between it and the sea from the rest of Arabia. S. 41. •It is very important that the demarcated frontier should be continued hevond the Amiri country to the edge of the desert, so as to place the Upper Yaffai and Beda and Behan on our side of the line After the desert is reached no further demarcation is necessary, though some understanding mav have to he come to regarding desert pasturage and wells. As it happens, the principal peojde of Beda and Behan, and of the Upper Yaffais have lately come in and asked to he taken under British protection, and I have addressed two or three letters to Government strongly recom- mendin' that protectorate treaties should he concluded with them. Fora loner time we thought that, as the Upper Yaffai Sultans had accepted stipends from the Turks, the whole tribe was more or less committed to the latter, although we knew the Sheikhs and people viewed the arrangement with considerable disfavour. Now, however, the principal Sheikhs have personally protested to me that so far from being committed to the Turks, they deposed the Sultans who accepted stipends, and that they are free from ail engage ments. I think myself that this is actually the case, and that, considering the Taffais as a whole are included in the “nine tribes,” there is no reason why we should not make a treaty with them. I hope soon to receive permission to conclude protective agreements in the usual form with the Upper Yaffais and the chiefs of Beda and Behan (also with the Upper Aulakis, if they wish), and I think it would be well if these treaties were signed before survey for demarcation is commenced. In any case I hope it will be made clear to the Porte from the first that we cannot admit their right to interfere with the Upper Yaffai or Upper Aulaki, or with Beda and Behan, which lie between these tribes; and greatly as demarcation is to be desired I would sooner see it postponed indefinitely than that these people should be abandoned to the Turks. Not only would there probably he turmoil and bloodshed before they accepted Turkish rule, hut good-bye to any chance of extending the land trade of Aden, a matter in which we are naturally interested, and to which, I believe, Lord Curzon attaches importance. With regard to Davies’ visit to Dthali, and the unfortunate flag incident, I enclose a copy of my instructions to Davies, from wTiich you will see how difficult it is to understand what is actually going on. We cannot identify half the places whose names come up, and, as a great deal depends on their exact location, it is impossible to say who is likely to be in the right, and who in the wrong. My impression is that some of the villages have changed sides several times, yielding, at times, to the Turks from fear (the people are not a fighting lot), but going back to the Amir when pressure was removed. However, I hope Davies’ report will make plain many things that are now obscure, and from the present attitude of the Governor-General of Yemen I t^st the danger of any difficulty arising is small. Further instructions have been sent to Davies in the sense of your telegram of 1st November, and he has been enjoined to act up to them most strictly. You will, however, understand that there is really no frontier line. Wahab told us where the limits of occupation lay when his survey was being carried on, but neither le lurks, noi the Amir, nor ourselves, as far as I am aware, have ever # Personally I think it is doubtful if they admitted that these limits are correct.* should be accepted. Hence the difficulties that continually arise, and the special need for an understanding as regards the Amiri country, whether demarcation of the whole frontier takes place or not.

I have found in the records . . . x . (Volume 686) a letter from the late Amir, written m March 1875, in which he describes how the Turks went through the country and the Sheikhs and people (who are not warlike) submitted to them through fear. He says “then they went to Johaf Men ram and Ahmedi and returned to Kataba.” Saleh Jaffer has inserted in brackets after .“Ahmedi (country not belonging to the Amiri).” But this authority is not conclusive, though it is, I think, this very paper, which was forwarded to the Secretary of State by General Schneider in his letter t Husein Helmi Pa*ha refers to the en- °f 30th January 1875, which the Governor-General of Yemen now quotes! as showing that the places in question are not part of the Amir’s dominions.

It is very important that we should be informed whether the Turks avp interfering or have recently interfered, with the Kafila road after it passef into th; Amir’s country; or with the villages in its neighbourhood ; and particularly whether they have established, or attempted to establish, a post at A1 Khureba or anywhere near the place where the road descends fmm the nlateau towards the plains. 8. You are aware of the dispute between the Amir and the Turkish officials regarding a fort or tower at “ Kharaba.” The Amir built a place which the Turks destroyed, saying he had made use of materials collected by them for the purpose of building a fort of their own. In March last the Amir reported that the Turks were going to build a fort there, within his limits, and he repeated this in July. The place is described as being on a hill “ near Ash Shafi.” He also talks about the district of “ Ash Sharaf.” In September Amir Shaif again wrote about this fort or post, saying that tlie Turks w r ere determined to construct it, and that the place was in the midst of his territory and near his own residence. Ash Sharaf is again mentioned in a letter to the Amir from his son also written in September. He says the Turks went into the district and summoned the principal inhabitants. 9. I have been unable to find any “ Ash Sharaf ” or “ Ash Shaft ” on Wahab’s map, but General Molyneux understood that “ Kharaba ” was the village four miles N.W. of Jabal Harir marked No. (&gt;3 on the map. The Amir’s letters, however, point rather to its being the “ A1 Khureba,” on, or near, the main road, where it descends from the plateau, although it is difficult to imagine wdiat possible right the Turks have to go there. 10. I think also some attention might be paid to the question of tobacco smuggling. In a letter dated 3rd A1 Kada 1318 (22nd February 1901), Amir Shaif complained that his people had been accused by the Turks of tobacco smuggling. He denied that there was any truth in the charge, hut it seems to me by no means unlikely that tobacco is smuggled from the Amir’s territory into the Turkish dominions; the length of the frontier and its indeterminate condition would seem to lend themselves to the practice.

Whether his claim in this instance admits of justification or not, you will give him the strictest instruc tions to avoid interference with places in Turkish territory, and it is obvious that the British flag should not be hoisted on do- bateable land, though it might be properly exhibited on the Anir'£ own house, or castle, on the approach of any party of Turks, or on ceremonial occasions. 3 * ^ Present dls P ut e appears to have arisen not only as regards Wara, but with respect to the three small districts of Ahmedi, 'Zorbi', (AzariAor Axraki} ' and Mehrabi. These we understand comprise the strip of country at the eastern foot of .Tabal .Tahaf, immediately between it at Ad Dthala, and/ t h e valleys to the south and south west of that place,but only Heh- rabiI appears on the mp, and it is shown there as the name of a tribe. -A1 Wara', which may possibly be the most northern vil lage of Ahmedi, is narked on the nap about a mile W. H. w. of Jaleli, where we know there is now a Turkish post, though it has not perhaps been there very long. Another. A1 Wara appears to be about 2 miles north east of Jaleli, This may he a Shairi vil -are andru they have obtained possession of any of he Shaibi vil'lsr^to n ° rth east; and lf so » whether the naibis have altogether lost their independence. The Upper Yaffai tell us that their country joins the Amir's, which apparently means that they come up to Jabal Harir on the east. We ought to know for certain if '''*-■*&gt; an:i also what are the relations of the Yafai with the Shaibis. 7 * It is ver ' r important that we should be informed whether the Turks are interfering, or have recently interfered, with the kafila road after it passes into the Amir's country, or with the villages in its neighbourhood; and particularly whether tney have established, or attempted to establish, a post at A1 Khureba or any where near the place where the road descends from.the plateau towards the plains. 8 ' , Y °' are aware of the dispute between the Amir anj tne Turkish officials regarding a fort or tower at ' Kharaba'.

I consider that it is best to postpone his departure for the present, but, if he has gone, or if the Viceroy has instructed you to send him, he must not cross our border, he must avoid all appearance of one-sided examination of our frontier, and take no steps which could be complained of as having nature of encroachment or of attempt to prejudge disputed question.

In that note Lord Granville stated that Musurus Pasha was well aware that frequent communications had passed between His Majesty’s Government and the Ottoman Government during the previous ten years on 'the subject of the relations between the latter and the tribes round Aden, whose Chiefs -were stipendiaries of the British Government. It had been repeatedly intimated to the Porte that the Sultan’s claim to sovereignty over those tribes could not be recognized, and that interference with them would not be permitted, and assurances had from time to time been received that instructions to this effect would be given to the Governor-General of the Yemen. It was therefore, Lord Granville added, with some surprise that His Majesty’s Government had read Said Pasha’s despatch, in which pretensions so often declared to be inadmissible were again put forward. To this language His Majesty’s Government still entirely adhere, and they regret that your Excellency’s note should have made it necessary for them to declare again that now, as then, they have no intention of withdrawing from the position they have consistently maintained on this question, and that they do not recognize the right of round Aden, namely: the Abdali, the Eadhli, the Akrahi, the Haushabi, the Akwi, the Amiri, the Subaihi, the Yafai, and the Aulaki. the Porte to raise any question as to their dealings with the rules of the nine tribes I have, &amp;c.

The views of His Majesty's Government with re gard to their rights over these Tribes have been frequently notified to the Porte and are mentioned In the two Notes to which the Turkish Ambassador refers in his present communication, but, in view of the formal manner in which the claim of the Sultan is now asserted, I am to enquire whether, in Lord George Hamilton's J -ne Under Secretary of .State, India Office.Hamilton's opinion, it would not be desirable to re ply by an equally foraal refusal to acknowledge the ola.m, repeating the expressions used in Lord Granville's Mote of January 10th, 1883, as given in the enclosed extract.
