'^oflioiD British Residency and Consulate-General, ,\V V Bushire, 7 Hoveinber 1908• From LaJor P*Z« Cox t Political Resident in the Persian Gulf• To S.H. Butler, Esquire, C.I.E., Secretary to the Government of India In the ioreign Department, calcutta. Sir, I have the honour to lay before (ioverment the present local aspect of the Abu i^usa Question. U). It Will be seen from the enclosure to ny letter l.o. 1B^2 -A dated 8th June 1908, that Hassan Samalyeh and l.:r. Brovm estinated, in iuay last, that the proportion of mined oxide lying on the Island, which was of marketable quality and v;i.xch tl^ey would prima facie be glad to ship, amounted to about 3000 tons; but .-essrs Wonckhaus• Agent then had no news of any desire on the part of his principalo to ship more in the near future and Hassan Gamaiyoh (who was informed by me that ho was at liberty to handle the oxide for the German Firm according to their requirements) replied that under the circumstances he would not commence moving more material to the shore until after the hot weather. ... little later, replying to a communication of mine, in the ■;:'Iirof'^'^e'i;08:'l letter of which I enclose a copy DrT'ist3m^roe^'consui, undertook to give me due warning of any intention on the part of Lessrs Uonckhaus to take a further shipment; and since my return from ishiraz at the beginning of the Present month, my colleague has informed me that although since JuneJune he has from time to tine renlnded Iiessro v ;onckliaus of their obligation to give ue adequate notice, up to date the firm has made no sign in that direction. He is now making another reference to them. Hassan Samaiyeh did indeed inform our Agent that he would re commence work after the end of Ramazan (circ. 26th October), but he has not yet started operations. It will bo remembered, however, that there is already a balance of about 400 tons lying on the seashore which the ,, Louise ,, could not take in April and which will form a nucleus for the next shipment, and Hassan knows that he can go on removing the other material to the sea, as soon as the uerman Firm are ready for him to do so. It is clear therefore that as far as wo are concerned, what is necessary for the facilitation of their operations on the accumulated oxide has been done. The delay which has occurred has been on their own part and we can do no more at present than await an intimation from them. (3). This inactivity on the part of the uernan i^irm during the past 7 months has a bearing upon the question of for ard contracts to which I venture to direct attention. In the communications of His j ajesty^ Government marginally (1) India office to Foreign office } cited, emphasis is laid letter dated 31st iiarch 1908# II (2) Foreign Office to India office 5 on the expediency of our letter dated 23rd April 1908. 5 (3) India office to Foreign Office ( making arrangemonts to letter dated 9th September 1908# enable ..ecsrs ..onckhaus to fulfil their contracts' x x x 'undertaken before the can cellation of the lease'. In this connection it will be remembered that the German Case dated 31st December 1907 represented ilessrs ./onckhaus as claiming, qua concessionaire against the iieikh. Complaint was made that the Sheikh^ action had prevented the concessionaires from fulfilling their contracts tg JonciJaauB under the document forming enclosure 5 of the German ^aee, but all tLat ..us said re- arding contracts from Messrs ;VonckhauB to Firms in xiiurope was that 'Herr Wonckhaus on his side has already sold the iron o^ide to his 'shipper and in order to fulfil his obligation must buy oxide 'elsewhere at a high price'.oooos ® I do not think we have anything more definite than this regarding iierr ^^oncidlauB , forward contracts• I may usefully observe here that 'Abu Uusa oxide' -las not yet achieved a reputation or assured position in the tradttf as has 'Hormuz Oxide'; and meanwhile it is reasonable to suppose that no trader in i^urope would be likely to commit liinaolf to forward contracts' covering anytlong period of time or considorable quantity of material. The fact is that up to now teafc Abu ^usa brj.nd has proved of variable quality; some consignments have been approved and some not; and the merchant in Europe is thus in the habit of protecting himself by stipulating 'I will take so many tons of oxide of the same quality as the shipment by such and such a vec^ol'. The terms of Hassan Samaiyeh's contract of 1st oune irOG ;vith . ocsrs Jonckhaus support this statement- Consequently, though, as statod In the (ioman Case, Kausan Samaiyeh has engagenenta vvlth Wonothaus to Uio extont set forth in the document of 1st June 1906, it seems very improbable that Kerr Wonoihaus has or ever liad any forward oontraots in connection with the Abu lusa material of such a definite natm-e as to cause him to stand to suffer loss for non-fulfilment, and his present inactivity gives support to this supposition. I have drawn attention to this point as a preface to the enquiry whether it would not be advisable for us to ask for a little more definite information regarding these contracts which we have b iven i -ecsrs .voncJihaus credit for having entered into, ;&gt;rior to the cancellation of the Abu i usa lease. At present U.o e i- nothing to preclude the firm from claiming to have contracts in Europe up to 1st June 1910 and thus prolonging Lasson iiamaiyeh's connection with the island until then. (4). Another point for remark is that according to reliable report the S.S. 'Louise' 's cargo of last is still lying at iiamburg unsold, and it seoms possible that the pretext may be advanced by the uerman Firm {in order to make capital out of tho non-sale) that the delay which intervened between the time at which this dispute arose and the date of the 'Louisa-'a arrival had caused the oxide shippedBxioha by hor to doteriorata. In viow of tiiie possibility I would ruantion that it has always been the oustom for the oxide operators, whether at iiormuz or Abu i.usa to accumulate by leisurely work on a small scale in slack times considerable quantities of oxide, ready for shipment when orders come in, and oxide so accumulated when the surface is acted on by rain or damp seems to provide itself ?Jith a hard superficial crust which is calculated both to preserve the interior from deterioration from weather or from adulteration by sand. So much for the material already mined and at the disposal of Hassan L&gt;amaiyeh and the (ierman Firm. (5). vastly, there is the question of fresh mining operations to be considered. In this connection. Government have decided that it is not expedient that the Sheikh-'^pf Shargah should issue a formal concession to a British Firm until the dispute with Germany is settled, lieanwhile, as reported in my telegram Shiraz Ho. 136 of 19th October 1908, the brother of the Residency Agent at Lingah is prepared to undertake the necessary mining opera^ions either without contract under the instructions of the Residency, or on a contract with the Sheikh. Any temporary contract with the Sheikh is, however, in my opinion, unworkable, and it is agreed that no contract for a term of years is for the present desirable. ./e are therefore reduced to the first alternative cmd this to me seems much the most convenient under the circiuistances. liut it will be clearly difficult to make an entirely satis factory arrangement unless the working a^ent is guaranteed against loss. The position is this:- ror the conveyance of the oxide, when mineu, to the ^ ore, transport involving an outlay of nearly 5000 rupees nust be pro vided in ccdor to put operations on an effective footing; tl .3re will also be recurring expenditure amounting to about 000 rupees per month according to the dogree of expedition necessary and the number of coolies employed (vide estimate attached). f ur Agent's brother or other nominee could hardly be expected to incur the above expenditure without definite orders for oxide In quantities such£0005 such that the proceeds will be sufficient to reinburse him. At present all we have in prospect is a probable request £or a sample shipment of 500 tons by icssrs Ctrick. s d The latter pay 4i2/6 per ton for the Hormux oxide, and essrs S d S y2l ^onckhaus 15/6 for the Abu Lusa brand. If ^.essrs otrick paid 15/6 for 500 tons, the proceeds would be 7750 rupees which uould barely cover the outlay if no further orders were received, if they paid even 25/- the proceeds would well cover the whole amount exponded and bi ve a profit, as well. The risk incurred by Govern ment of ultimately losing money by giving a guarantee is therefore very small and in any case we migjit reasonably arrange ./ith the sheikh that the money be reimbursed from the proceeds, if and when a new concession is granted. If therefore ^essrs otrick signify their willingness to take the 500 tons as their local agent has advised, I recommend that 1 be authorised to instruct the resi dency Agent's brother to go ahead and lo inform him that over this shipment he will be guaranteed against loss. ± vill undertake that expenses are supervised and kept down to the utmost. I beg that this question may be given early consideration jbending receipt of Messrs Strick's reply from London expected shortly. (0). If Messrs Strick'tffc wj-now want a sample -(their decision probably deponds on what is passing betwoan than and the iloln in regard to honauz)- then I think we night postpone the actual institution of fresh nining operations until oono oti-or demand for oxide is notified; but, in any oaeo, 1 would ask the same autho rity to oonmenoe work through the Lingah Agent's brother uhen necessary under the arrangenent above suggested. (7). In view of the apparently bad reception of the 'Louise''s cargo it seens possible that Messrs V.onciiliaus nay say that the quality of the accunulated oxide not now finding a narket, they would be glad to have sone of the freshly nined article. i presume that in that case we could assume that they had no further claim on the remainder of the accunulated oxide, and should inform Hassan Samaiyeh that he could either take it by a certain date or leave it. v ;ewooe tfe oould tiion go on oupplylng ilosars l/onciihauo or others, with froGlily ninod material under the above arrangement, mtil of another conceasion by the Sheikh of Shargah imder oiir auspices. (8). The xtosidenoy Agent at Lingah reported on 17th November that Abdulla bin iiassan Samaiyeh had been getting various religious luminaries to record their opinions in reply to some set questions which had been submitted to them, regarding the Abu J usa lease, and that -ir. ^rown was endeavouring with considerable difficulty to make translations of the papers. ;3eyond this, I have no special information as to action which the German Firm may be taking local ly in connection with the argujr^nts which liave been exchanged bet ween ourselves and the oen:an '.ovemment in this case# I have the honour to be Sir, Your most obedient servant. : ajor.

From—His Excellency the Viceroy, Calcutta, To—His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, London. ^ Abu Musa red oxide concession. Please see Major Cox's telegram No, 136, dated 19tli October 1908, forwarded with our Foreign Secretary's weekly letter No. 43-M., dated 22nd October. Hassan has not commenced removing oxide and Cox lias been told by German Consul tbat, thougb since June, he lias from time to time reminded Wonckhaus of obligation to give notice, that firm lias not moved in the matter. Stress was laid in statement of German case on loss to Wonckhaus owing to failure to supply oxide in accordance with terms of forward contracts. Eiriii's inaction leads Cox to doubt whether forward contracts existed, especially as the Abu Musa oxide has no assured position in the trade. It is rumoured that the 400 tons shipped by the Louise are lying at Hamburg unsold. As to progress of negotiations with Germany, we have no recent information, but it would seem desirable, if possible, to obtain definite information from German Government as to nature of alleged contracts and Wonckhaus' intentions as to further shipments unless there is^ a demand for oxide. If he is required to carry out further mining operations it will be necessary to guarantee Eesidency Agent's brother against loss. Strick &amp; Co.'s local Agent has apparently informed Cox that his firm will want 600 tons. Unless this be true, Cox recommends that until there is some demand for oxide, Residency Agent's brother should postpone recommencement of mining operations. ^ We are disposed to agree. 'Whole case is explained in Cox's letter of 29th November, copy of which was forwarded with Foreign Secretary's weekly letter of 24th ultimo. •i n &gt; 8. g. p. l—2757 f. d.—13-1-09—30.a.&amp; t. j . malcolm. jl. . ~ ^ — 'r' /Jo.

After the trial shipment is effected at the agreed temporary s d price of Ir)/6 f.o.b.; I should propose, subj ect also to Messrs.

The method of so working the mines to be on the same basis and system as the concession given by the Sheikh to Sumaya,but limiting the number of partners,including the Sheikh and ourselves,to four persons to be named later,instead of six or more as in the case of Sumaya 1 s concession. The working expenses to be advanced by us and to be deducted from the net f.o.o price as paid bv Messrs Wonckhaus to Sumaya and the balance as profit^to be divided amongst the partners as under Sumaya's arrangement f It will bhus be seen that a larger proportion of profit will go the -(?)

I also ex plained to the Sheikh of Shargah by letter the emergent ar rangements being made in his interest for the supply of this particular consignment of oxide. By this time operations must have begun. They will be carried out with the greatest economy so that some margin of profit may result. I therefore trust that the arrangement may hold good. No further sign has so far been made by the Germany, nor have operations been resumed by Hassan. S dr &lt; 00063 T. J .

The late German Consul who has 1 oeeii on leave since April 18th must have been well cognizant of the fact that these operations were in progress but he did not take any exception to them. An official protest and a demand that the operations shall cease has however been lodged by his successor on the ground that the German Firm's claim is not limited to the oxide that has been mined previously and that mining or shipment of fresh oxide constitutes an encroachment on their rights.

With reference to the latter part of my telegram No. 672, dated 3rd July, in connection with the Abu Musa case, I have the honour to draw notice to the conduct of the Samaiyehs, father and son ; and to ask Government to consider whether and wliat steps can conveniently be taken to place a check on their troublesome amenities and bring them to their bearings as British subjects. 2. Since receipt of Foreign Department letter No. 1959-E.B., dated 28th May 1908, I have not reverted to this topic, hoping that the early settlement of the Abu Musa question would clear the way for us, and hesitating meanwhile to introduce any fresh factor into the dispute ; but settlement continues to be delayed, and meanwhile Hassan Samaiyeh and his son presevere in maintaining an attitude which would not ordinarily be tolerated from any individual enjoying British protection in this region. 3. I n^ay mention one or two instances in point : — Our Agent at Lingah has for years past experienced a great deal of trouble from the vagaries and intrigues of a Persian named Muham mad Abdulla, who though carrying no commission and though the Tehran Government have refused to agree to his appointment, has nevertheless managed, by flying a Turkish Flag and using a spurious rubber seal, to pose as a Turkish Consular official and, under this guise, to make difficulties for our Agent by encouraging visitors from Oman or Bahrein to accept his protection, and in other ways. We have repeatedly complained to the Governor of the Gulf Ports ofc the conduct of this Persian and also to His Majesty's Legation. While Muhammad Abdulla has always been repudiated he has never • been suppressed, until last year when the Derya Begi in pursurance of orders received from Tehran took the opportunity afforded by a personal visit to Lingah to have Muhammad' Abdulla's FlagstaiJ removed. Soon after this incident, the Wali of Busreh, who properly speaking would appear to have no status to interfere in affairs on the Persian Coast, sent-a representative down to Lingah whom Muhammad Abdulla took steps to cram with garbled stories of his ill-treatment by the Derya Begl, and this has^now resulted /. in a complaint against the Derya Degl by the Turkish Legation and a demand that the Governor of the Gulf Ports should give satis faction. A telegram recently received by His Excellency from the v v • ' Persian Foreign Minister quotes Hassan Samaiyeh as being one of /'i ^ r the persons who had furnished statements on which the Turkish k demand for satisfaction from the Derya Begi was based. 1 he fj ^ ■ j' x other two persons who are quoted by name are also individuals with o\ pronounced anti -English proclivities, one of whom has lately been removed from the post of French Consular Agent which he formerly held. ^ I am directing the Residency Agent to call upon Hassan Samai^eh for copy of the statement made by him to the Turkish official and for an explana tion of his conduct in mixing himself up with such a matter without consulting the Agency. (b) In my last as will be seen from the papers attached, Hassan Samai yeh addressed an imperti- Shargah, No. 104, dated 12th May 1909. nent e ff us i on to the Sheikh of Shar^ah regarding the recent mining operations at Abu Musa, at which Sheikh Saggar was much annoyed. He was of course informed by me that he need not take the missive seriously and recommended to refuse any communication from Hassan Samaiyeh or his son unless it were received through the Residency.(c) Lastly we have Abdulla bin Hassan's expedition to Abu Musa on the present occasion, undertaken apparently with the idea of pick ing a quarrel with Khan Saheb Agha Bedi or getting the latter to ... 0 , 0 , , , „ t commit himself in some way (vide • Nos. 282 and 283, dated 23rd June. r&gt;-i A i. # u Residency Agent s reports* attached). I may mention incidentally in this connection that my present German col league, writing to me in regard to another matter two days ago, informed me that he had ' been over head and ears in work lately on account of Abu Musa, etc.,' so I suppose we may expect some result at an early date. 4. If some check is not placed on Hassan Samaiyeh and his son, they will become still further imbued with the idea, which they already seem to possess, that as long as they have German support they can snap their fingers at their own Political authorities. At the same time I have necessarily been cautious of making threats which I might be unable to enforce, or taking action which would prejudice our attitude in the negotiations with the German Government. I think, however, that the matter has reached a point at which some definite action is very much needed, and trust that Government will subject it to their wise con sideration. 5. It may possibly be considered that a convenient way of exerting pres sure would be to inform the Bombay Persian Steam Navigation Company that we object to their continuing to employ the Samaiyehs as their Agents at Lin- gah, but having regard to the spirit in which this Shipping Company received Shiraz telegram No. 19 to Foreign Department, a( ^ vlce proffered them by the Govern- dated 27th June 1908.

Bushire, it is hardly to be expected that tney will be any more anxious to comply with our wishes in the present instance unless the expression of those wishes amounts to dictation, and I realise that this may be difficult.

I gather, however, from the aforesaid Sheikh and his uncle Salem bin Sultan that they are much annoyed by the word ing of that letter in which the bm Samaiyeh threatens them in respect of the oxide mines which are at Abu Musa, because they suppose that the bin Samaiyeh has no right of ownership in the said mines and that the matter has been settled through you, and they are astonished by the contents of the bin Samaiveh's (letter) I told them that they should not trouble their mini (about this) and that I will represent the case to you and a reply will be received shortly The ^hn h! 0 hK K Uer ;' h , 0w ; ever ' 13 (dne to) Hassan bin Samaiyeh's son Abdulla who has the habit of indulging in (such) proceedings in this matter s is stsi r iie b - p - amw.. to Ha,™ bin Smaljd. .mil Ih. receipt „l'U, S' ' ' '' l, ' Translation of a letter, dated Lingah, the Rahi I i 3 2 7 from Hassan Un Ah el Samaiyeh &amp; Khalcd, Lniei of zhargah. We beg to state that as you know, all the oxide mines which are on the Abu Musa island belong to us and our Syndicate and are under our control and in our possession and that no one else has anv rlal nf ' . excavating anything of the oxide from those mines onthe ^bu Mu^aiS which3 especially belong to us and to our _ Syndicate. Vou have, however, forcibly usurped our right of ownership without justification and prevented us from excavating any oxide from those mines and the matter remains pending (and) under dispute up to now. We perceive that you do not seem to have prevented others besides us who are now working on behalf of the British and excavating oxide from those mines which belong to us on the Abu Musa island without our knowledge. We see that this all is contrary to righteousness. Therefore we notify and inform you that those who are now engaged on behalf of the British in excavating oxide from those mines will not be, obviously, responsible to us, at the end, for the loss because in connection with this affair vou are responsible. And please note that you yourself are responsible to and answerable to us for all the damage and delay in this work because you did not prevent others from work ing on your mines despite your knowing that our case is going on against you in regard to those mines which are our property and belonging to our Syndicate. It is probable that if you lost the case there will be heavy and great expenses, all of which you will have to incur yourself. Further we inform you that you should prevent and warn that no one should work in the oxide mines which belong to us and to our Syndicate on the island of Abu Musa and that they should not remove any of the oxide which they have dug from the said mines, neither for transportation nor for shipment. Please note all what we have mentioned to you in this notice : you are personally responsible to us for losses, shortages, damages, delay and the ruin which may result from the excavation of the abovementioned mines j and the responsibility lies on you personally which please note. Translation of a letter No, 282, dated the 23rd 'J-une igog, from the Residency Agent, Lingah, to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to state that 1 arrived at Abu Musa island in the S. S. Gulistan ^ at noon on the 15th June igog, and that the ship was engaged in loading oxide. Abdulla bin Hassan Samaiyeh had hired a ' Mashowa' belong ing to Nakhoda Abbas, an inhabitant of Keis and arrived at the Abu Musa island in that vessel on the 16th June 1909 being accompanied by Mr. BonstafT, a mem ber of the firm of \\ onckhaus &amp; Co. at Lingah and Haji Ali the German employe of the said Company. They landed and went to the place where the lighters were engaged in shipping the oxide to be taken to the steamer. After inspecting the place they came to me and having partaken of tea and coffee, Bonstaff inquired as to how much oxide was being shipped in the steamer. I replied to him that the account was with Sheikh Saggar's employe and the ship's people. He stated I am much astonished that notwithstanding your presence in the island they are shipping the oxide of our mines.' I answered him that the owner of the island and the mines thereof was Sheikh Saggar bin Khaled, Chief of Shargah, and that he, of course, had the control over his property. He next remarked. This house in the island is ours ' and pointed to the house in which Hassan bin Samaiyeh's implements remain. I replied that in fact no one owned any house on this island, much less this house which has been built by order of the Sheikh. He answered ' Hassan bin Samaiyeh has told us that this house is ours.' I replied to him that the statements of Hassan and Abdulla bin Saniai^eh were without foundation. Abduila bin Samaiyeh being present there Bonstaff inquired from him stating ' you stated that the house was ours ' while Beder says it is Sheikh Saggar's.' Abdulla bin Samaiyeh could not deny at that time, and replied that the house belongs to the Sheikh. This is the detail of my conversation with Bonstaff in the island of Abu Musa. I told Abdulla bin Samaiyeh that he knew well that Sheikh Saggar, Chief of Shargah, objected to his coming to Abu Musa and that he (the Chief) had strongly prevented his doing so (mentioning that) if he came to Abu Musa with out the permission of His Britannic Majesty's Resident and Consul-General, he himself would be responsible for such harm as may befall him ; that it had been \4 frequently mentioned to him by the Agency before this that whenever he wished # to go to Abu Musa he must inform the Agency according to the rules ; that it he had not been present at Abu Musa he would have been prevented, as a matter ot course, by the representative and the employes of the Chief of Shargah accord ing to the orders they had, and that he had been the cause of mischief and evil and that all the responsibility was on him as he has caused this irregularity. Abdulla bin Samaiyeh, Bonstaff and Haji Ali, the German, returned to their Mashowa and stayed in the anchorage. Bonstaff and Haji Ali landed unawares on the 18th June 1909 and went towards the mine No. 1, and the others. I told the Sheikh's employe to watch their proceedings and not to neglect this, and that if they prevented his going with them he should answer that he has been ordered by the Sheikh not to allow them to land in the island and that as the Residency Agent was present at that place he did not prevent their landing but he should be present wherever they wished to go. Abdulla Roodbar^ the Sheikh's employe, went after them and was prevented by Bonstaff and Haji Ad from going with them. They asked him as to who had ordered him to go with ^ them.^ He replied that he had been ordered by Sheikh Saggar to prevent them from landing there but that he did not do so as the Residency Agent was present and was, however, to accompany them wherever they went until they returned to their Mashowa. After inspecting the mines they returned to their Mashowa and stayed there until the 19th June, when Haji Ali the German came and stated on behalf cf Bonstaff that he wanted passage tickets for two adults to Lingah by the steamer. I replied to him that the captain had not yet agreed to return to Lingah and that I was still in communication with him and I could give no such tickets and that the Captain himself must decide. He replied that he had heard that the Captain was not going to Lingah. He returned to their Mashowa and they returned in her to Lingah two hours before the ship's departure. Translation of a letter No. 2S3, dated the 23rd June igog .from the Residency Agent, Lingah y to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, With reference to this Agency Report No. 282, dated 23rd June 1909, I have the honour to state that Abdulla bin Samaiyeh had the object of creating mischief in taking those proceedings and bringing Bonstaff and Haji Ali the German, to the island ot Abu Musa and that he had the intention of bringing about a dispute. The members of the firm of Wonckhaus &amp; Co., especially the two abovementioned, are such that they always follow this type of mischief makers. Should you deem it advisable and should it be possible it is most proper and timely that an arrangement should be made to give him ample punishment for this illegal proceeding which has been taken by Abdulla, It seems that if he is forgiven he will take such proceedings as will cause considerable trouble for the Residency, because Abdulla bin Samaiyeh's tomfoolery, pride and sincere anglo- phobian sentiments and especially his unity with the said firm, are not hidden from all the inhabitants of Lingah, etc., and Hassan bin Samaiyeh does not oppose him also. I represent this as it is my duty to bring to your notice what I deem fit as a well wisher. G. C. B. P., Simla.—No. C-7s F. D.—21 -7 09—40.— E. A.

I also beg to submit extract of an interesting letter of I6th ' ultimcC'rom Messrs Strick re Abu Musa and its oxide. I personiljy am of opinion that the sample shipment per 'Calis- tan* should not be taken as a standard or as ■ driterlan, as t believe that the ore has not been put out in a scientific manner; of course due to want of experience on the part of the workmen. I have fullj explained this niatter to Agha Bader when he was here last, and he seemed to appreciate my explanations. Tf further and regular shipments are to be nade,] should propose sending some experienced workmen to supervise the .mining and thereby ensure the selection of better stuff. I am writing to Messrs strick by out going mall to send out a requisite number of screen.^which are indispensable, and as I , ^ v So.I consists of'g3od oxide have reason to believe that the bulk of the minejlike your and my sample) I am sure a good steady business will follow. I have already written to Messrs Strlck for a quantity of explosives (gun powder cartridges) for clearing up the top of the mines,which Agha Bader told me was absolutely necessary. The following is extract of Messrs Strick.s letter,.above referf-ed to dated London I6th July t909. ' ABU MUS A; We have your letter of 20th ult. .■ '(ruli stan ' parcel: last mail we received samples and a full(2) 00195 (^\ • account of what took place from the time paptain ^oore left linga until he returned there.after completion of loading. The samples are portions of larger samples taken during the loading, TIMS QCn UPI SD J1»0ADI NG; Thi s i s disappointing, seei ng that from time of vessel leaving Llnga until she arrived back thare, ^ days had elapsed. Captain Moore states that to insure good despatch in future,there should be a better supply of badges. He also corside^pd the supply of coolies insufficient,and states that with a good supply of mineral on the beach, plenty of coolies,and not less than six boats,the rate per day could be increased to 160 tors. QUALI T Y *GULI S TATi*: If the samples we have received fairly represent the bulk,the result will be most disappointing,and it is really very doubtful whether we shall get the principal buyers to try it at all, wwever we shall make the best of a bad job,and will explain to our customers that this trial parcel was worked before we could arrange for proper supervision, and that,in future ,we intend to have the mineral worked in a more scientific manner, raore carefully cleaned,and better select ed, screened, etc. Nevertheless,it is much to be regretted that the parcel is not of better quality, and nearer the standard of the 'Luristan* sample (kindly supplied by Major Cox) and your I'/th April sample. One expert states that,as a result of hia:Lests,it wonld appear that t /ae^ulistan* samples are not only much imerior to all the samples we have recently received,but,in the natter of strength,are only about SIX that ol* the •Louise* German parcel! Another expert,who tested the mineral in a different manner,found,on levigating, that out of iSbO grains, he obtained 360 grains of hard gritty material.0019&amp;-\ (3) (gt) # of low Rtalnin^ powo^and only 200 grains of soft gofid colour ing matter,or say about 36#. We may mention that in Hormuz the proportions are about 80X good, to ZOi bad. Thus quite apaH from the darker shade of colour, this shipment from a mechanical point of view is only about half as good as Hormuz. Although as mentioned above the matter is most disappointing, yet we cannot help thinking that with more skilful minim^and careful selection,it nay still be possible to do something M with the Abu liusa ore. We may mention that the four samples u themselves differ rather considerably one from the other,show- u ing that the selection at the mine had not been carefully done. it We have now received four sets of samples from Abu Musa altogether, viz. those mentioned in your letter of jVth April, the 'Luristan' 8Rr?ple(Major Cox), Agha Bader's two samples mentioned in your letter of 8th May,and,lastly,those received from Captain »fOore taken during loading. Of the above samples your No. I, y7th April, is much the best,while the '!iUristan* is also good ,but the 8th May and 'Gulistan* samples are much inferior. Can you account for the differences in any way ? SCRE2NS: We do not know whether there are screens at Abu Musa, nor whether the 'GUlistan' parcel was screened, but,in the case of future shipments, this certainly should be done,and,should there be no screens, we will arrange for two or three to be sent out. In our opinion, the best pattern would be a slanting screen about 6' x 3*, -J-' mesh, against which the workmen would throw shovelfuls of ore, the fine passing through the screen, and lumps falling back. You ask us to give our views as to the futureof Abu Musa. Our opinion is that if there is good ore to be found in suffi© 001S7 (4) (§ cient quantities.we should try to get the concesssion for a : ] ; , o-f years,and work the mines ourselves. As-to mode and amount of payment, these details will naturally depend upon the rinlity of the mineral.the quantity,also the coPt.Of workina,transporting to shipping place,and shipping. ' QUALI TY AGA IM; One of the experts who tested the 'Gulistan* s^jniples was of opinion that ?t is very similar to the parcel - imported some years ago in one of Jones, Price's boats, we bel?eve the Sigrid', and which the expert in question s purchased at about P8/~ per ton^elivered in London*.

BuFLRRjEsq , C.S.I,, C.I.E., Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. In their telegram No. S.-284, dated 14th July in connection with the Abu Musa correspondence, the Government of India instructed me that a pledge which had been asked for by the German Government was under consideration and that meanwhile it was in any case clear that the controversy had reached a stage which in practice made it advisable that no further mining operations should be embarked upon for the present. 2. I now have the honour to report that on the 9th instant the Acting Vice Consul for Germany informed me in conversation that Messrs. Wonckhaus wished to remove some more of the accumulated oxide down to the beach for shipment. He could not then give me the name of the vessel or probable date of her arrival and thought the consignment might be for India only, by a vessel from India. He was inclined to demur a good deal to giving me precise infor mation regarding the date of the arrival of the ship, arguing that there did not appear to be any likelihood of difficulty on the island, so why could Hassan Samaiyeh not have open permission to send coolies to work the oxide and why could not the ship come and take the stuff away when convenient. I explained that I had been made responsible that there should be no contretemps on the island or obstruction to Messrs. Wonckhaus's operations for removing the accumulated material, and that to this end I needed both to inform the Sheikh of the contemplated visit of a German ship and to give explicit instructions to the Residency Agent at Lingah, so that it was very necessary that I should be kept informed regarding the approximate time of the vessel's arrival as I had been on the last occasion by his predecessor. Consul General to Acting German Consul dated 14th August 1909. Acting German Consul to Ccnsul General, dated tpth August 1 OQ. Consul General to Acting German Consul, dated 21 st Augu«t 1909. We have since exchanged the communi cations of which I attach copies. 3. I have not yet specifically heard , __ , f the sale of the S.S. '' Louise's ' ship ment m Hamburg and from the trend of Herr Wassmuss's remarks durin^ my conversation with him on the 9th I am inclined to surmise that owing perhaps to some comment made by His Majesty's Government on the failure of Messrs Wonckhaus to take advantage of the arrangement made for him to fulfil the contracts which he claimed to have entered into, the German Government have pressed the firm to keep alive their active interest in the island. 4. I presume that the provisional instructions now issued by His Majestv's Government as to the suspension of mining operations are not intended to modify the standing instructions under which I am required to see that all reasonable facilit i es are accorded to Messrs• Wonckhaus for moving the accumulated material and have therefore continued to be guided by them, but should the pledge asked for by the German Government entailing the cessation of minincr operations, be ultimately given, then I venture to hope that it will be considered possible to close the island altogether to the oxide industry, after the present shipment, until this controversy is laid to rest. It would be difficult to make the Sheikh of Shargah and the other local elements interested understand the equity of an arrangement under which they themselves were not allowed to mine or handle the oxide for their profit, while the German firms were permitted to remove and sell quantities of the accumulated mineral at their will. 5. Under such conditions it will be more than ever to the interest of the German claimants to Keep the controversy alive as long as there is any mined oxide left on the island. They can go on removing it at their leisure while the Sheikh of Shargah being meanwhile deprived of any profit from the island will ■ •■ no . of 1909. / ritish Residency and Consul a te-Genern.l, Bushire, 22nd August 1909. 00209 I f I have the honour to forward herewith, for your information No. *205 b of 22nd August 1909. i a copy of the letter cited in the margin, ivhich I have addressed to the Government of India In the Foreign Department on the subject of the Abu H um , dispute.

As to the very poor quality of the oxide shipped per •Oulistan*,we ourselves have no doubt whatever that J ha defect is mainly due to the ignorant workmen,who might have also for their own convenience mixed up some rejected ores mined previously by others, and lying in close proximity to the shipping place. 4.

STAN* , The above steamer arrived in London last Tuesday,and no time was lost in obtaining samples, which we much regret are no better than those received from Capatin Moore by post from Bombay, In fact,in one respect,viz; higher percentage of moisture, they are even worse. The result is that the best bid we have so far received from one of our oiggest buyers is SOs. per ton landed. Another important buyer wired us yesterday that he found the •gullstan* oxide quite useless for his purposes, W# are awaiting the report of our chief buyer,but fear it will rot be satisfactory, seeing that he has already expressed a strong opinion as to the poorness of the sample received by post from Bombay. We have sent samples to four or five other buyers,but must candidly confess that prospects a^e most gloomy. Is it possible that the natives mixed oxide from other mines with rrhni they had worked in No 1 ? One expert is strongly of opinion t^at such must have been the castf. As the other mines are adjacent to the shipping place,and some hundreds of tons were lying by mine No 2,and seeing also that the natives had greatly exagger ated in their report to Major Cox the quantity they had worked, ready for shipment, ex No I mine, it was perhaps a temptation to them to •borrow' from some of the old workings in order to Increase the quantity, supposed to have be»n dug out by them. One feature, which rather supports th'* s opposition # is the fact that while in the •Oulist^n' parcel there are many micaceous iron particles, in the(f) 0CS22 aapiple dravm by Captain Moor« from the actual lod^the^e is practi cally non«. Whether this was so or not, it is clearly evident that the parcel shipped is much inferior to the oxide lode in mine No I, and the only other theory to account for the diffference is careless working. From what Capatin Moore tells us of the methods adopted, it is not surprising if much extraneous matter did get mixed with the pure oxide. He informs us f a3 mentioned in his lett\er to you, that the mine is in tho form of a crescent-shaped cliff,about 40 to 60 feet high, the lode of oxide bein^ about 20 feet thick and situated at the bottom of the cliff. Above the oxide is 20 to 30 feet of earth,as Captain Moore reports,something like Fullers Earth. The mine is approached from the front by an incline, dipping at/ an angle of about 60 degrees, there being a level space of barely six feet at the bottom of the cliff. The coolie^s with their primitive tools slice out a quantity of oxide,and,eventually, a quantity rf earth falls on top of it. The earthy matter is cleared away aft^r a fashion (that is, it was so treated when Captain Moore was watching,out, possibly,not so much care was taken when nobody was looking), and thrown back on the Incline. To work the mine properly, the whole of the top layer ol earth, and any poorer quality oxide, likely to be found on the top of the oxide lode,should be removed. This, of course, would mean a lot of work,but, unless the mineral can be mined In a jpure state , it will not be worth mining at all. It must be borne in mind that even the purest oxide yet found \t Abu Musa is much darker in colour than Hormuz. According to Captain Moore, the only coolies working the mine were about a dozen of the Sheikh of Shargah's men,and,when Captain(3) 00223 Moo^e amveu, th3 SV coolies he had taken from T inga had actually worked out about 60 tons to make up his parcel, so that, instead of Lne alleged 600 tons being ready waiting shipment, there couM not kar keve been 300 tons ready when the steamer arrived!! This is bad enough, but, when it turns out that the ore for which we have paid It)s. por ton F.Q.B. Abi' Mnaa, is not apparently worth 5s, per ton F ,0 ,B,, we feel that we have come off decidedly badly. Of course, we are not in any way blaming you or the British Fesidency/vhich has taken so much trouble in this matter on our behalf,but it shows what we feared ab initio,viz. that it is impos sible to carry out anything requiring care and judgement in a satisfactory manner, when it is left to natives. As tMngs look at present, we stand to lose a comparatively big sum, considering the smallne^ of the h M pment,smd , if we do make a loss,we think it only equity that it should be made good to us, either in nash or in kind. If the latter method be considered the more feasible, it might be arranged to give us a certain quantity of good oxide free the next time we send a steamer to the island, that is, of course, if ,in the future, the mine can be worked,so as to obtain any oxid^ good enough to ship to this market. Ou** disappointment is great. We hoped to compete with Hormuz, but such low grr.de o^e ^s the w 0ulistan # will be absolutely useless for thi^ purpose, and the annoying part of the transaction is the knowledge that good enough oxide apparently does exist^ in Abu Musa, if only it could be mined properly, and delivered here at a . reasonable price. We feel sure that Wajor Cox and Captain Trevor will also be disappointed at the result , which we fear will be so disastrous, after all their kindness and exertions on our behalf. The question now is whether it is possible to get the oxide( oja V : 00221 t4) mined fjc 9ntlfically,or rather, methods of common sense, at a reasonp.hle cost. If not, then the whole business must be dropped. If, on the other hand,the powers that be can devise means of having the work properly done, o^ will allow ue to do the work our selves, then, in time, we may yet do some good with Abu Musa, Yours faithfully.

Deep as our regret Is to learn for certain that the shipment of oxide per •Gulistan* is of auch bad quality, yet the matter Is not a surprise for us, as we now know beyond a doubt that the oxide has not? been mined with scientific frethcis. In fact it has been put out irliscriminately by ignorant workmen* A couple of our men who we^e deputed to prospect^ the other islands had also by chance gone by tne •Qulistan* to Linga and their report entirely confirm what you now write,that the oxide was of very poor quality. In fact one of them says that he took some hand- fuls of oxide belonging to the Germans and awaiting shipment to compare with the lot which was being shipped per •Gulistan* and found the latter much darker in colour and inferior in quality. He also rinorts that some ^ood. oxide also exisued in tne lot which was be^ng shipped pe*- '^listanVDut that unfortunately it had got mixed up with inferior and darH.lumps which the coolies had pulver ised. We quite agree with you in all you say in your letter under reply and are decidedly of opinion that you are fully entitled to an adequate compensation in the manner you suggest,viz. that you be given gratis a similar quantity of oxide to be mined afresh under more scientific methods and under supervision of some experienced persons who can discriminate between the good and Inferior lodes existing in the mine, and this will be a fair test for the future of Abu B'sa.■■ It is the opinion of experts that if Wine Mo T at Abu Wrsa would were carefnllr wortced the ore wiii not be Inferior to that of Hormi'Z, and indeed A^a Bader to whom we have fully explained matters In h: 8 last letter to us says, that if mo^e oxide id to be mined irem Abu Musa he is the qnality will be equal or perhaps superior to that of Homuz, With tills assu^moe, ocvij:l«ud v;ith trie iict that our No I sample of JVth April was found by you to be of satisfactory quality and supported by Captain Moore's sample from the same ppotjit would certainly be a pity to abandon Abu Musa and it would be a good policy,taking everything into consideration that you be f;iven a fre sh suppl y gratis, so as to ensure an important and continuous business. We informed you last week of Major Cox*8 departure to England and he should have arrived when th5 s preaches you,. We strongly advise you to meet him explaining everything and asking for a fresh supply of say 400 tons as above, and we feel sure that if the case is properly represented to him he will accede to your request, as ha Is a very just and reasonable man,and anxiius to promote BHt:6h trade and help British traders; so meet him by all means and inform hlrr. of our views and of Bader 1 ^ promise for good quality in future, A*; Informed you our letter of yesterday Aga ^ader say^ there are some 3Vb tons of oxide at |bu toisa from his last workings,tut we do not know whfct the quality is likely to be,and should therefore not reco^nend this lot for shipment to London,but if the Resident sanctions It v/e should suggest their shipment to Bombay, where better results may be obtained, and meanwhilerwe intend sending a bag or two to Bombay as sample.(*) 00227 Wo shall infom. ^jor Trevor of the purport, of letter under reply, but we feel sure h« will not act without consulting Major Oox,fic you should be sharp and meet itojor Cox and trj' to obtain his permission on s.11 points by telB^ram.

T - M resmlt8 ^ teats made of the •Gulistan' parcel by the render, of our principal customers fully confirm the bad reports of the frat tests.and. although we may yet be able to get some of our friends to take portions of the shipment, it will only be as a favor ,0 ns, as they all tell us that it is of such low quality that they prefer having nothing to do with it. A*the best bid in T .ondon was ?0s. per ton ex ship.we have arranged -r about half the cargo to be transhipped to the Eorth. and the balance to the West of frigland, and the mineral has been ' discharged into two sailing craft for these destinations. We have arranged to have official weights taken at time of discharge at final destinations, prom appearances, we think there will be a slight excess in weight over the VLading quantity, but this is no dcubt due to the fact that during the rough weather experienced on pascage. » certain amount of water was washed down over and absorbed by the mineral, farther t.eRts of samples taken by Captain Moore prove that( &amp; 00229 (2) with carel'ul mining,and selection, there should be fairly good sale for Mo I Abu Musa,but, unless the management of the mine car be entrusted to a reliable and experienced man, an^La repetition of the 'Gulistan* shipment prevented, it will be much better for all concerned to leave the business alone. Beeinfi the trouble and expense wa incurred in sending the 'Gulist^n' to load the parcel, and the delay to the vessel loading it, and the fact thrt Vie shipment has turned out such poor quality, had ^ve Vnown beforehand what the result was going to De,we should not have touched it,had it been offered to us f^ee, The German shipment per •Louise* was poor quality, but the '(rulistan' is worse, and one expert decla&gt;*eo that as it shows some characteristics which do not appear at all in Captain Moore's sample,it could not all jf^ye come from Mo I mine. If,after paying the out-of-pocket expenses,Major Oox has any balance over,we certainly think it should be returned to us,and not paid over to the sheikh of Shargah. What with the delay In bringing forward the sample, and then the miserable quality of the shipment w /hen it did arrive, a splendid opportunity of competing with Hormuz has been lost. We may mention that, on analysis, the 'Gulistan' parcel showed almost POX less peroxide of iron than your No I sample,I7th April and fejor Cox's sample.

In the same letter (by a strange coincidence) we mentioned that apparentlj the best method of working the mine would be,as you now state Khan Aga Bader himself suggests,viz. to remove the earth from above the oxide lode. Referring to what you write about the necessary blasting op»raticne, we are inquiring as to what would be the simplest and safest method that could be readily adopted. From the lact that ■•ou ask us to send out the cartridges, we presume that you have either obtained permission , or that yo«»havo good reasons for knowing that there would be no difficulties placed in the way of their being landed at a Persian port, for transhipment thence to the island! To make the natter quite clear, we snail oe glad ii jou will cable us on receipt of this letter,and.for this pu-pose, please add to your code the word 'Blastable*, .•neaning , you may ship blasting cartridges', and ,should you cable us 'Blastable Ungah*, or 'Blast- able Buehire', we shell understand that we are to ship them a or via Bush!re,and that you have safe means of having them transhipped thence to the island. If you cable us 'Blastable direct', we shall understand that you wish the cartridges, if shipped at all, to go a steamer calling at Abu Musa. In the latter event,although it would be the safest and would doubtless avoid all difficulty with the Persian Authorities, it might be ajlong time before we could for an outward bound staar^r to call at Abu Mu5?a«0023^ ■ £ • (s) From what Captain Moore told us of the nature of the soil over lying the lode, we should have thought' that with a good supply of picks,crow-ba^s,and shovels,tlie work could be done fairly expedi tiously^, provided sufficient coolies were employed.

A tlie 110110111 to invite a reference to the Resident's letter No 208fi dated 21st August 1909 on the subject of a further shipment of oxide from Abu Musa by Messrs. Wonckhaus and Company. ™ tin S ^ le ' er of 14th August to the German Consul, Major Cox wrote to the Residency Agent telling him to inform Hassan bin Samaiych that ie could collect and ship oxide for the German firm on condition that he gave an undertaking in writing not to send any armed men to the island, nor to attempt to interfere with the mines, nor to take any oxide other than that left on the beach by the b.S. Louise or the heaps taken out from the mine by himself { ai i n t^TT addition Major Cox instructed Agha Bedr to state that Abdulla bin Hassan was only authorised to proceed to the island when the ship arrived, as before. F Dining the first week of this month, Mr. Wassmuss called on me and intro duced the subject of Abu Musa ; he said that he heard that Agha Bedr had imposed conditions on the German firm. I remarked that the conditions were imposed on Hassan Samaiyeh. Mr. Wassmuss said that the German firm had no objection to the conditions about no firearms being taken or to that specify ing the oxide to be taken, but they were particularly anxious to send Abdulh bin Hassan Samaiyeh to look after the mining. I informed Mr. Wassmuss in reply that ^ I could not admit that the matter was one in which Messrs. Wouck:- h?.us and Company had any right to intervene, and that the conditions on Hassan Samaiyeh were imposed solely in order to prevent any regrettable incident with Sheikh Suggar's people. Mr. Wassmuss then asked me to look up the conditions and see whether they were imposed by Major Cox. This I did and subsequently informed Mr. Wassmuss in a private note that I saw no reason to alter the arrange ments made by Major Cox. I now trouble Government with this letter as I think Mr. Wassmuss will complain to his Government about this matter. There is really no ground for doing so, as Hamad Samaiyeh, brother of Hassan, is the man who always takes charge of the coolies and can do the woik well. Abdulla, on the other hand, is an intriguer and mischief-maker. He is suspected by the Criminal Intelligence Department of smuggling arms into India, though unfortunately no proof can be obtained. He tried to get up a dispute when the S.S. Gulistan went to Abu Musa in June {vide my telegram No. 672, dated the 3rd July 1909). He has also mixed himself up with politics, etc., at Lingah to such an extent that we have seriously thought of taking steps to deport him, but have refrained from doing so, as it would have looked bad while this case was going on. In the circumstances it seems quite justifiable to prevent his going to Abu Musa except when the ship goes to load the oxide, and I do not think the Germans will be likely to press the point. It seems advisable, however, to lay the facts before Government in case the matter comes up. Mr. Wassmuss informs me that Messrs. Wonckhaus and Company wish to have 400—500 tons of oxide ready for a ship about the middle of October. This will entail coolies going to the island about the 20th of this month. C-558 F. DiBu shire, 28th September 1 Wy237 With reference to previous correspondence on the subject, have you not heard yet fron London what the actual amount of oxide shipped in the 'Gulistan' was? I am very anxious to settle up accounts with the aheikh regarding that consign ment. With regard to the reference made by Messrs StricW to the bad quality of the oxide in thoir letter which formed an enclosure to your letter of the 8th instant, I think the unfortunate landslip which occurred at the mine when the stuff was dug out has a great deal to do with it# Every effort ^as made to get rid of the ear^h which fell in the r ino, but no doubt some of it got mixed up with the oxide. You wore inform ed by jrJian Sahib Agha Bedr of this unfortunate incident at the time I think. I do not think that unskilful digging had much to do with it, as no doubt the majority of tho coolies enr loyed by Agha Bedr'a brother wore men who had been there before and knew the work well. I hear you want another sample of oxide. Do you want a sample of tho samo stuff as selit by the 'aulistan* or a new lot? TmJ. Malcolm, iiisquire, Bushire.' ■ •urn COUFIDEUTIAL. vdo^n i 4 no .

As to the sample required by us and kindly referred to by you,we understand that about. tons have been recently broughtto the beach by Agha Bader.but. we do not know whether these are old or fresh outputs; hence our desire to have some samples of the present lot.

Herr 'Wassmuss intimated to the Resident as far back as the 9th August last that Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. proposed to remove some 4 to 500 tons of oxide. So far nothing has been done, and as will be seen from the correspondence the actual shipment has been put off from month to month. In fact Messrs. Wonckhaus, while putting forward various excuses for not having arranged for a steamer, have not actually made any serious attempt to secure one.* Herr 'Wassmuss now in his last letter, forwarded herewith, attempts to attribute the delay to the conditions which have been imposed by the Resident on Hassan bin Samaiyeh. As I have already had the honour of in forming Government in my letter No. 2318, dated the 12th September last, the only point on which there is any difference is regarding the right of Abdulla bin Hassan Samaiyeh to go to the island. In my opinion there is absolutely no reason why this individual should go to the island with the coolies, and as I have already stated in the abovementioned letter, there are many reasons why he should not do so. 4. The correspondence and the disingenuous attitude adopted by Messrs. Wonckhaus prove, I think, that this desire to ship 400 tons of oxide is not a genuine one and that it has been expressed, as suggested by Major Cox ^ in paragraph 3 of his letter No. 2086, dated the 22nd August, solely with a view to keeping alive their active interest in the island. S\ 5. If it has been agreed between His Majesty's Government and the German Government to ' sterilize ' the island I venture to suggest that I may be authorised to inform the German Vice-Consul that Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. should effect this shipment of 400 tons of oxide before a certain date, after which, in accordance with the agreement between our respective Governments, no further shipments of oxide by any one will be permitted until the whole question has been settled. As Messrs. 'Wonckhaus &amp; Co. have already been trifling with the matter for four months, it would not, in my opinion, be neces sary to give them a long period'of grace, and the final date for the removal of the oxide might be fixed, if Government see no objection, at one month after the date of my letter intimating it.

Sir00279 Sir E. Grov ventures tc Dcint cut that the under- taking given to Count Metternioh in his note of the ?8th July last was given on the understanding that the reply of the Germans might be shortly expected, in accordance with a verbal statement made bv Herr von Kiihlmann on the 16th June, 4# and that the declaration made bv him on the 13th ultimo intro- duces a new element into the situation, since, if the s tatus quo were indefinitely prolonged it is evident that British interests would be placed at a manifest disadvantage, for whereas His Majesty's Government would have no right to touch any of the oxide in the island during the whole of that time. M essrs. IVbnckhaus would be able, whenever it suited them, to remove portions of that already mined on their account. In view of this consideration and of the fact that, since the date of Sir E. Grei^s memorandum of the 28th * July 19C8, more than a year has elapsed during which it has been open to the German Government to examine these papers. Sir E. Grev feels it his duty tc state that His Maiestv f s v v «&gt; Government could not consent to prolong the present situation indefinitely unless the German Government, on their part, are willing to give an undertaking that Messrs. Wtinckhaus will not only refrain from extracting mere oxide from Abu Muse, but also from exercising their right to remove from the island that03280 that which has been already mined pending a settlement of the whole question.

I undertand that at the berinninr of last month Your Excellency hoped to be able to furnish me with a reply to the Memorandum of the Tlst September within six or eight weeks, and I trust that this may be found possible, for His Majesty's Government would feel themselves unable to grant permission for any further shipments of oxide, unless an undertaking is given by the German Government in the sense of the last paragraph of the Memorandum above referred to.

The Gerraan Consul in answer to my letter enclosed in the above, now ouggosta that in order to settle the difference of opinion as to whether Abdulla bin Hassan should or should not be allowed to go to Abu M Musa, a suggestion has now been made by Wonckhaus and Co that they should undertake with their own coolies the shipment of the 400 tons. I think that we have not , so far, recognised 4 ■ that Messrs Wonckhaus and Co have any direct interest in Abu Musa but only a contract with Abdulla H to receive oxide from him f.o.b. ^e have , on the other hand agreed to allow Messrs W to export the oxide which has already been mined.

This now seems a most unlikely thing to happen. My personal opinion is that it is not particularly desirable to allow the German firm to get a direct footing on Abu Musa, but perhaps , in this instance, it does not matter much as it is to them that the rained oxide is to be given. Hassan , Wonckhaus or anyone could easily remove the four hundred tons which is lying on the beach the fuss made about the necessity for Abdulla*® presence being quite uncalled for.

This reply, which has been very carefully an thoroughly prepared ana contains a good deal oj new evidence collected in the spot, if forwarded in a note expressing the opinion of the German Goverrwier^ that, if His Majesty's Government should decline to admit the grounds on which the Geman contention is based but should adhere to the view which they have hitherto held, the point at issue should be referred to the Permanent Tribunal at The Hague. It appears to Sir K.Grey that, whether His 7 35ty's Government accept or decl ine t)11s last proposal, it will be equally necessary to sutnit ^ne new evidence now brought forward by the Gentian rovz. to careful scrutiny on the spot and also to collect all the counter^evidence that can be obtained.
