With reference to your letter N0.1295-D., dated 27th February 1917, to the address of the Political Resident, I have the honour to report that, under instructions from Sir Percy Cox, I recently proceeded to Katr, accompanied by the political Agent at Bahrain, with the object of procuring the signature of the Shaikh on the parchment treaty. Shaikh Abdullah received us most cordially, and signed the parchment copies without comparing them with the original in his possession, and after a mere pretence at perusal. Tne only point raised by him was in relation to tne letter given him by Sir P. Cox, a copy of which was forwarded with the latter’s letter No.T-15, dated 4th November 1916, and he appeared quite satisfied witu tne assurance given him that the terms of that letter were still in full force. In fact his whole conduct on tnis occasion showed a degree of confidence in the good faith and friendship of Government which is highly creditable to him. The three parchment copies of the treaty are being forwarded to you in a separate parcel. Sir, • InIn this connection I have the honour to invite attention to ray predecessor’s letter No.2124, dated 18th December 1916 recommending sanction for a salute of seven guns for this Chief. He made no reference to the question of a salute on the occasion of his visit to me on H.M.S. 'Mozaffer', but this is a point which will undoubtedly occur to him before long, and it is desirable that it should be settled before Katr is again visited by a Political Officer, I have ascertained that Sir Percy Cox is still of opinion that seven guns is a suitable salute, I have, euc., Sd/- J.H.H.

Sir, ' In continuation of my letter No.14-S., dated t February 15th, 1918 on the subject of the Katr treaty, I have the honour to report that the Shaikh made a verbal request to me that I would ask Sir Percy Cox to send him some short rifles for use by his men when mounted on camels. I reported the request verbally to Sir Percy, with the idea that some suitable rifles might be available locally, but have now been instructed to report the Shaikh’s request to Government, with a recommendation that if rifles of the kind required are available, such supply as Government may deem suitable may be presented to the Shaikh, in addition to the 300 rifles already received by him (vide your telegram No.55-3*, dated 10th January 1917). The Shaikh showed meme a sample of tne kind of weapon preferred Dy him. It was a .303 carbine witn Martini action. I have no idea whether such a weapon is available in India, but any form of carbine would no doubt be acceptable. In view of the satisfactory attitude of the Shaikh and the fact that this was the only request of any kind preferred by him on the occasion of tne signature of his definitive treaty, I strongly recommend that it should if possible oe granted. No number of rifles was specified, but as the Shaikn's object was to arm his escort of camelmen, I consider that the amount granted should not be less than 100, and might extend to 200 if available, with 100 rounds of ammunition per rifle.

I I, Shaikh Abdullah bin Jasim bin Pbani, Undertake that I will, as do the friendly Arab Shaikhs of Abu Dhabi, Dibai* Shargah, Ajman, Bas-ul-Rhaima and Umtn-al-Qawain, co-operate with the High British Government in the suppression of the slave-trade and piracy and generally in the maintenance of the Maritime Peace. To this end, Lieutenant*Colonel Sir Percy CoS, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, has favoured me with the Treaties and Engagements, entered into between the Shaikhs abovementioned and the High British Government, and I hereby declare that I will abide by the spirit and obligations of the aforesaid Treaties and Engagements.

In token whereof, Sir Percy Cox has affixed his signature with the date thereof to each and every one of the aforesaid Treaties and Engage ments in the copy granted to me and I have also affixed my signature and seal with the date thereof to each and every one of the aforesaid Treaties and Engagements, in two other printed copies of the same Treaties and Engage ments, that it may not be hidden. III And in particular, I, Shaikh Abdullah, have further published a proclama tion, forbidding the import and sale of arms into my territories and port of Qatar; and in consideration of the undertaking into which I now enter, the British Government on its part agrees to grant me facilities to purchase and import, from the Maskat Arms Warehouse or such other place as the British Government may approve, for my personal use, and for the arming of my dependents, such arms and ammunition as I may reasonably need and apply for in such fashion as may be arranged hereafter through the Political Agent, Bahrein. I undertake absolutely that arms and ammunition thus supplied to me shall under no circumstances be re-exported from my territories or sold to the public, but shall be reserved solely for supplying the needs of my tribes men and dependents whom I have to arm for the maintenance of order in my territories and the protection of my Frontiers. In my opinion the amount of my early requirements will be up to five hundred weapons. IV A- I, Shaikh Abdullah, further undertake that I will not have relations nor correspond with, nor receive the agent of, any other Power without the consent of the High British Government; neither will I, without such consent, cede, to any other Power or its subjects, land either on lease, sale, transfer, gift, or in any other way Whatsoever.

Cox K C,S I K.CLE- Political Resident in the Persian Qulf, -The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment. In continuation of my telegram No. T.-14 of . . „ , „ -- to-day’s date, reporting conclusion of the Treaty with the_ Shaikh of Qatar, I have the honour tP forward the [original and two copies of the said Treaty, with accompaniments, together with English versions of the same. One example is with the Shaikh and one I have retained with myself for the present in case reference is re quired to it, 2. I have a few observations to make in regard to points on which I have departed from the previous draft. Article 2 .—I duly placed Shaikh Abdullah in possession of {a) The com pilation of our Treaties with the Trucial Chiefs, 1906, and {b) The supplemen tary compilation of 1912, with each item endorsed by me ; “ Communicated and delivered to Shaikh Abdullah bin Jasim this 3rd day of November 1916 in conformity with Articles (1) and (2) of the Treaty of same date ” ; but at the moment of signing up, after being thoroughly bored by the laborious comparison, signing, and sealing of 5 examples of the Treaty, when Shaikh Abdullah was asked to proceed with the affixing of his “ signature and seal to each and every one of the aforesaid Treaties and engagements in two other printed copies of the same ” he demurred greatly to the task, on the ground that he had accepted them as a whole in his Treaty with us and that that should be sufficient. To have insisted would have involved going through with him carefully every page and every item that he had to sign, and arguing again many unimportant details of them which are obsolete or inapplicable to the case of Qatar at the present time ; I therefore did not insist. In point of fact the call for such a plethora of seals and signatures is one that any unsophisti cated Arab Shaikh would jib at. We do not exact them from new Trucial Qhiefs on accession, it being consideied, in their case, sutficient _ to make sure that they are in possession of a copy of the Compilation or Treaties and to take their assurance that they accept the obligation to abide by them. This Shaikh Abdullah has specifically done in Article (1) of his treaty with us and I hope that it will be regarded as sufficient. R. Article 3. —In pursuance of your telegram No. 331-S., dated 29th June 1916 , this article has been amplified in order to provide reasonable safeguards ao-ainst the sale to the public of rifles obtained by the Shaikh through our auspices ; and the annual allowance of them is reduced from not exceeding 1,000 *’ to “up to five hundred.” 4 Articles 6, 7, 8 and p —These were the 4 articles regarding which difficulty was to be expected. As we had decided not to press for the admission of British traders for the present, article (6) was altered so as to apply to British merchandise only and not to traders, and was placed before the three following items as being more likely of acceptance _ As now worded it is intended to protect British Indian merchants residing m Bahrein consigning goods to their agents in Qatar. I was prepared, as authorised, to eliminate the next three Articles if it should prove necessary, but the alternatn e course ot allowing them to stand, while postponing action on them hy a separate letter seemed preferable, as obviating the alteration of the Treaty at some future time, and the possible citation to us by other Shaikhs of the special treatment of Qatar in these respects. I trust the Government of n la will be of like opinion. „ „ , , . 5 My subsidiary letter to Shaikh Abdullah-—Tie first presse or^ a definite respite of 10 years from the operation of these Articles, as well as ror the assuranc P e that they should not be put into ^^UTlmi^sa W v While not agreeing to specify any particular period I thought 1 might sately say that action would noJ he taken on the articles “ n H'f c T^rencT his consent, seeing that ultimately we are m a position to compel concurrence. 1 \'V ; ) !:' ; . with X F9HEI3IT SECRETARY’S no. 0 5 u 1 IoLicC]913or to clianare Abdullah for a chief who would accord it, should the matter ever become of sufficient urgence. I have little doubt, however, that now that our relations with Qatar have been placed on an assured and definite basis these desiderata will be secured without much difficulty in the course of time. 6 As regards the question of slaves already existing in Qatar the Govern ment of India will realise that if Political Officers were to take any ill-consi dered line of action in the direction of manumission of Qatar slaves pursuant to the conclusion of this Treaty Shaikh Abdullah’s position among his dependents would straightway become extremely difficult. The trade in new slaves at all events by sea has practically ceased to exist m the Gun of late years ; a few no doubt continue to be brought over from the Mecca side, but very few ; and among those already here it is found that apart from the initial evil of the truck-system on which from time immemorial the pearl-fisheries have been run, cases of serious maltreatment are by no means common, nor are the Shaikhs concerned unamenable to advice, f am of opinion therefore that both our requirements and the interests of the negroes will be adequately safeguarded by our making our abstention from interference contingent on the hypothesis that the Shaikh and his depen dents treat their slaves fairly. Shaikh Abdullah has assured me that he will be at pains to see justice done in any cases which are brought to his notice. In this connection it will be remembered that in^ the case of Kuwait we have no slave Agreement at all and in the quickly improving conditions and civilising influences of the present day we are getting on satisfactorily without one. 7. I was prepared in connection with the negotiation of this Treaty to be asked by Shaikh Abdullah to take action against his disaffected elder brother Shaikh Khalifah, but their relations seem to be a little more satis factory at present. I offered, if Abdullah wished, to send for Khalifah and cfive him a homily and a warning, or to write one to him, but the Shaikh thought it was not necessary at present, but said he would ask for such help later if the circumstances made it unavoidable. He thought Khalifah’s line of action would be, not any open opposition, but the incitement of 3edouins to harass Qatar so as to discredit his (Abdullah’s) rule. 8. No money passed between myself and Shaikh Abdullah; the necessity for any payment did not arise. The Shaikh, however, explained that owing to the stoppage of all supplies of arms in the market since his accession he was very short of them and begged me if possible to let him have some in the same way that we had supplied others of our friends. I told him that the matter depended on what we had to spare at the moment, as we had had so many such appeals but that I would see what could be done when I got back to Basrah. Shaikh Abdullah was very friendly and cordial throughout and I think quite realises which side his bread is buttered. 9. Captain Bowie, Acting Political Agent, Bahrein, accompanied me and I also took with me Haji Yusuf Kanoo, a prominent merchant of Bahrein (and possessor of the Kaiser-i-Hind medal) who is Shaikh Abdullah’s com mercial agent in Bahrein and has his confidence. He rendered me a good deal of help in talking sensibly to the Shaikh and re-assuring him in regard to points of doubt. Trusting that my proceedings will be generally approved. Enclosure No. 1.

I would reconmend another attempt to get the Treaty signed without alteration, in order to keep, it in line with those in force in the case of the other Sheikhs in treaty with us, but I think we might i&gt;v S Sheikh Abdullah a separate letter at the same time explaining that it was important to have the treaty worded on the same lines as others but assuring him that we have no intention at present of pressing for fulfilment 01 Arfjl - clea Iv » V and VIII.

As regards Article VI of t he Ge ner al T reaty', I am of opinion tnat it would be best for Sheikh Abdullah to sign the treaty as a whole out with the reservation above the signature in regard to the above Article that he does not subscribe to Article VI. 7.

E. The 'Lawrence' having left Bahrain on 19th October, anchored m in Doha Bay about noon on the 20th; and I and Major Keyes called on Shaikh Abdallah at 4.30. We were received by him with friendliness, and, as far as I could see, with an absence of suspicion and mistrust. This interview was devoted to the establishment of cordial relations. 3. The Shaikh cane on board the following day by arrangement at 2 p.n.; and, after the usual polite remarks, I ascertained from him that he was really desirous of having intimate relations with His majesty 1 s Government, thaijhe recognised the fact that such relations must contain elements of advantage to both sides, and that he preferred to hear first what we repaired of him. I then read clauses I and II of our draft treaty followed by copies of the mutual undertakings with the Trueial Chiefs to which they refer, making from time to time the necessary explanations. Mo objection was made to any of bhe provisions of these latter, except to Article 6 of tne General Treaty, which appeared to cause some uneasiness, and is, in fact, somewhat difficult to explain at an early stage of negotiations with one who is a comparatively new acquaintance. I therefore dropped it for the time being; and the Shaikh accepted the remainder oi the articles and. undertakings, expressing his gratitude for the promises made in return. Clause III relating to the arms traffic was then discussed. I impressed upon the Shaikh the important fact mat all our friends among his fellow rulers were now working with His majesty's. Majesty 1 s Government for its suppression; and described in particular the co-operation of Shaikh -Hpoarak; pointed out to * him that arms could no longer be obtained from Ifasqat; and explained carefully the suggested arrangements whereby he might be supplied with arms for personal and State use. The Shaikh agreed that the trade had practically ceased, and remarked that nuite recently some Afghans had visited the port with a view to tne purchase of rifles, and had returned to their country empty-handed. He promised to think the matter over, and I did not press for an immediate reply. Te then proceeded to discuss Clause IY regarding the admission of British subjects to v^atar for the purpose of trade and I was rather ‘surprised to find that Shaikh Abdallah was not at all inclined to accept this. He said that the people of v : atar were still strongly anti- foreign, and would not consent to the reception of foreign traders, and MMffi that he would be in constant fear of trouble resulting to himself from the bad treatment of such persons by his people, and tl i.a t the opportunity would be taken by his enemies to place him in difficulties with his majesty 1 s Government. Ee assured me that he had no personal feelings on the subject, and that his fear of the presence of a British Agent did not in the least mean that he objected to nritisn guidance and control; but he snowed so much ois^ress of mind tkct after a time I was obliged to leave the question with the remark that he need not fear tnat his majesty*s Government would ever hold him or any otner Shaikn in treaty relations with them responsible for what he had done his uest to prevent. Passing over Clause Y, I read and explained Clause YI which presented no difficulty. The Shaikh wished to know how Mubarak of Kuwait and Isa of Bahrain treated any communica tions which reached them from the agents or nationaj-s of otner Governments; and received with interest and approval, the accounts given by Major Key 03 and myseli in leply. Clause YII he was likewise disposed to accept without demur;demir; !mt, in regard to YIII, said that, though he recognised and appreciated tee advantages of post and telegraph offices, the difficulty in regard to foreigners would unfortunately cone in there. The Shaikh was by this time showing signs of fatigue, and 4 I postponed iurtiier discussion for the day, having read over to him the remaining clauses of the draft treaty, savinr that he now knew all we required of him, and that I hoped he would give the question of the admission of British subjects further consideration, as it was difficult to suppose that His Majesty ! s Government would readily recognise a true friend in one who would not allow their subjects to trade in his dominions. 4. The next day Major Keyes and I visited the Shaikh, and referring to Clauses IX and X of the draft treaty, I asked him to describe without reserve the difficulties of his position of which we had already heard something; and to make any suggestions he wished as to the help we might give him. He said in reply that his cousins and elder brother, Mhalifah, were envious of his position, and always ready to intrigue against him with Abu Dhabi, an ancient enemy, or others, whenever opportunity offered. I suggested that a treaty MKM ■^tween him and His Majesty 1 s Government would bring them to see the necessity of abandoning this course; and lie admitted their fear of reprisals by us in the event of an attack upon him, but added that they had already tried to employ the recent events at Doha in connection with the Turkish garrison as a means to set local opinion against him on a.ccount of his leanings towards us. I asked what the effect upon the people had been. He admitted that it had not amounted to much, and that these enemies could not injure him to any great extent without help from outside, upon which I pointed out that Abu Dhabi, being bound by the undertakings we had read yesterday, could not take steps against him without coming directly into contact with us, provided that ^atar had likewise joined thethe signatories. I questioned the Shaikh regarding his fighting strength and that of his unfriendly relations, and was told that he was only afraid of a field-piece which is in the possession of his 'brother Kkalifah, who has a small estate on the shore about 4 miles north of the port of Doha. He asked whether GrOYernment would give him a Turkish or some other gun superior to Khalifah T s, which though serviceable is of old type, and I promised to refer the request in due course. Shaikh Abdallah then went at great length into the provi sions of Clause IX and X of the draft treaty, and put up various hypothetical cases in order to find out as nearly as possible the extent to which Government would be prepared to support him by land. I represented that I had not the power to say exactly what Government would do in any particular case, but pointed to the satisfactory condition of Chiefs who had committed t hens elves entirely to us, and showed that the extent of our support would depend upon that of his confidence in us and the loyalty or otherwise with which he carried out his obligations. This explanation was accepted as satisfactory. A lengthy discussion then took place upon the other clauses of the treaty, particularly upon that relating to the admission of British traders. The Shaikh had. evidently given deep consideration to this subject, but could not bring himself to agree to the insertion of Clauses IV, Y and VIII. I used every ■possible argument, but without avail. In regard to the Arris Traffic, the Shaikh asked what he should do in the event of a dhow filled with arris for sale arriving at his port after he had undertaken to join in the +-xa fvo-Ffnp T replied after some discussion, suppression ot the iraiiic. i - ry r- L - u ' 1 , , that he could either send the boat away, or confiscate the arris which could he set against the number allowed for yearly importation, as he wished. Shaikh Abdullah then intimated that he was willing to accept this clause (and to publish the proclamation regarding 4-i « ftv.a r rv»f£ie) in addition to clauses I, Ii, vl, •' 11 &gt;0 and X, and those of the eneagenents with the Trucial Chiefs wliicli are not peculiar to one or r.ore of tiler , ritl. tlie exception of Article VI of tlie rT Genera3. Treats* •j *conclusion I asked tlie Shaikh, to pive r e a reply for G-overnnent in his own words. He said - 'Vlease tell then that I will gladly undertake everything else that 2 t ou have put to ne, and that I an verv sorrv indeed not to be able to accept British or an^r other foreign subjects as remanent residents in ny countr] 7- at present. I would we leone then gladly myself, but ny people are not yet sufficiently civilised, nor is ny rule sufficiently consolidated, and I an afraid of serious trouble, which could only end in nv own destruction, if I allowed foreigners in now. You nay add, however, that this is only a temporary difficult^ which I hope a few years will remove, and I promise, if G-overmient will allow clauses IV, V and VIII to stand over for the present, to consider them again later and to accept then at as early a date as possible'. Haj or Keyes and I then took our departure and returned to K.h.S. 'Lawrence' which left that evening for Bahrain nnd Basrah. 6. The clauses refused by the Shaikh being among those marked bv von as essential, I was not able to enter into treaty without reference to higher authority and H.k.S. 'Lawrence' being obliged to return to the Shatt-al-Arab for water almost immediately, prevented me from entering into telegraphic communication with j ou. In consideration of the Shaikh 1 s remarks given above, and the fact that the position is much as stated by him, I am disposed to recommend that the Government of India may be pleased to accept the explanation of his inability to admit British traders into his dominions for the present, and to negotiate the remainder of the draft treaty on the understand ing that a subsidiary agreement regarding the clauses omitted will be S made subseouently. I am convinced that Snaikn AbdallahAbdallah will abide loyally by the engagements into which he is now prepared to enter, and I believe that practical experience of our encouragenent and support will increase his reliance on us, which is really all that is necessary. It is suite possible that, should we decline to treat with hir: without these clauses he might ultimately agree to their inclusion under protest, but, unless it is considered that there is any urgency in regard either to.the admission of traders, or a British Agent, or both, the acceptance for the present of the Shaikh 1 s explanations will pay us best in the long run, as it will, in vw opinion, he more likely to win his confidence and regard. I an averse, generally speaking, to coercive measures with Arab Chiefs, except in cases of obvious breaches of engagements. 7. As far as could be learned from the interviews described above. Shaikh Abdallah does not appear to be a strong character but his position is certainly not an enviable one as he is at •present situated, and. allowance must be mace for tnat. &lt;e will be better able to form an estimate after some experience of his adherence or otherwise to the engagements specified in the treaty. 8.

According to my recollection, when I discussed arms traffic with Sheikhs Jasim and Abdulla they assumed that if they undertook to prohibit it they would get a subsidy to make up for loss of income* Mention of Anns traffic thus means|too'much] subsidy and hence my recommendation to drop both. If the Arms traffic lingers we can take undertaking in that connection later on and pay for it. Or if the Government of India prefer it we mi^at retain Anns traffic clause; omit subsidy clause and in lieu of it offer Sheikh an honorarium of 2 o thousand rupees for conclusion of treaty as a whole. Cash would probably tempt him to accept and in any case a present may be necessary of 5000 or 10,000 rupees.

To this end, Major Knox, Political Resi dent in the Persian Gulf, has favoured me with a printed copy of the Treaties and Engagements, entered into between the Shaikhs above mentioned and the High British Government, and I hereby declare that I will abide by the spirit and obligations of the aforesaid Treaties and Engagements. On the other hand, the British Government undertakes that I and my subjects and my and their vessels shall receive all the immunities, privileges and advantages that are conferred on the friendly Shaikhs, their subjects and their vessels. In token whereof, Major Knox has affixed his signature with the date thereof to each and everyone of the aforesaid Treaties and Engagements in the copy granted to me and I have also affixed my signature and seal with the date thereof to each and everyone of the aforesaid Ireaties and Engagements in two other printed copies of the same Treaties and Engagements that it may not be hidden. And, in particular, I, Shaikh Abdulla, have further published a procla mation, forbidding the import and sale of arms into my territories and ports of Qatar. It is understood, however, that tbe British Government will arrange to grant me facilities to purchase and import, from tbe Maskat Arms Ware house or such oth«r place as the British Government may approve, for my personal use and for the arming of my dependents, such arms and ammunition as I may need and apply for in such fashion as may be arranged hereafter, through the Political Agent, Bahrain.

P ^ that m 0V if rnment llave suggested that it is perhaps desirable that this Tieaty should be an accomplished fact whenever the discussion among the Powers as to the future of Arabia comes up. suusion 3 A ^ view of the fact that we are at war with Turkey, our past relations with that Power m regard to El Katr may be regarded as dissolved, and we* may consider ourselves m a position to start afresh. At the same time, in relation to the outside world generally, our position in the Persian Gulf, and a fortiori in regard to El Katr remains unaltered and the fact that the Gov- ernment of India have not concluded a formal Treaty with El Katr could, it is thought, not possibly affect the question of the future of Arabia, in anv arrangement between the Entente Powers. The mere existence of a small lacuna in our Treaty relations with the Arabian Coast of the Persian Gulf at El Katr could scarcely be used by either Prance or Bussia as grounds for a claim m that vicinity, and it is difficult to believe that either of these Powers would make use of this as* an eicuse for questioning our paramount position m that direction. 1 k non l&amp;trjfiE 4^ Admitting, however, that His Majesty r s Government have good reasons for pressing the conclusion of the Treaty with El Katr, the Govern ment of India are of opinion that there are considerable difficulties which mahe such a course undesirable at present. In the first place, a necessarv preliminary to any negotiations with El Katr is the ejection of the Turkish garrison at El Bida. It is understood that a ship of war cannot be spared for the purpose, and it would be inadvisable to detach even a small force from Mesopotamia. Apart from this* the question of El Katr is intimately connected with the negotiations at present in progress with Bin Sand and it would be a grave error to prejudice those negotiations by concluding before hand a Treaty with El Katr, the terms of which Bin Sand might conceivably consider objectionable.. Then again, the present Shaikh of Katr, Shaikh Abdulla Bin Jasim, seems to have some difficulty in holding his own, and it would obviously he undesirable to conclude a Treaty with a de jure ruler unless his position is also assured de facto. Until the Government of India are definitely assured as to the ability of Shaikh Abdulla to discharge his obliga tions under any Treaty which may be concluded, they are not prepared^to conclude such a Treaty. 5. Eiually, I am to point out that in the draft Treaty forwarded with Major (now Lieutenant-Colonel) Knox’s letter No. CL 52, dated the 21st July 1914, it is proposed to give the Shaikh a subsidy of Rs. 1,000 a month, and this seems an innovation on the prucial Coast, for neither under the f l reaty of 1868 with the Shaikh of Katr, nor under any of the Treaties with the Truciai Chiefs, are subsidies given. 6. I am to add that one of the main objects of the proposed Treaty with El Katr was the control of the arms traffic, but it must be remembered that the present war has considerably modified the conditions in this respect, as for some time to come, the arms traffic in Europe will be at a standstill, while with the elimination of Eiench interests in Maskat and our own improved position in the Gulf generally, we should be able in the future to control this traffic on much stronger and more uncompromising lines than heretofore. In so far then as the arms traffic is concerned, a Treaty with Katr would appear no longer to be a matter of urgency. ' 7. I am to request that you will consider the matter in the light of the. foregoing remarks, and favour the Government of India with your views as to whether the conclusion of the Treaty with El Katr is immediately feasible, and if so, with whom, and on what terms it should be concluded.

Sir, I have the honour to invite a reference to correspondence ending with my letter No. Cf 52, dated &lt;olst 1914, on the subject of a proposed treaty with Shaikh Abdullah bin Jasim bin Thani• In my telegram No. 1042 dated 30th August 1914, I informed you. Sir, of the satisfactory reply that had been received from Shaikh Abdullah in reply to the letter in which I announced to him that War had broken out between Great Britain and Germany. The value of that telegram is however, to some extent, discounted by reports received by last mail from tne rolitical Agent, Bahrain, who derives his information mainly from Khan Saheb Yusuf bin Ahmad Kanoo. He has also had the advantage of recently discussing the situation with Shaikh Khalid bin Muhammad, bin Thani. The reports of Khan Saheb Yusuf bin Ahmad Kanoo undoubtedly show that disunion reigns among the members of the Bin Thani family, and that Shaikh Abdullah bin Jasim has some difficulty m holding his own. He seems to be far more tractable than the remaining' members of the family and, theoretically at axl events, holds views as to the maintenance of order, equality of all before the Shara 1 Law and general justice which seem to mark him out as the man for our purposes. But the difficulties of his position, whichwhich he would, it might be hoped, surmount if left alone, are greatly enhanced by the tendency to intrigue with Bin Sa ? ud, shown by Shaikh Khalifah bin Jasim bin Thani. The Mir would be no Arab if he did not welcome the opportunity of increasing his territory and influence and the outlook for the independence of Qatar is gloomy, unless we can arrange to bolster up the authority of the Shaikh. The Turks would no doubt view with satisfaction Bin Saud*s advance along the coast line hoping, not without some show of reason, that it would embroil him with us. The result might be to throw Bin Saud still more under Turkish influence or to weaken his prestige and authority. In either case, the Turk, who loves fishing in troubled waters, would think he stood to gain. Again, if Qatar should fall into the hands of .uin baud, tne consequences for the Trucial Chiefs, commencing with Abu Dthabi, are bound to be most serious. They have been severely scourged this year by the ravages of plague and, on the top of that, comes financial ruin, caused by this most disastrous War now 9 raging in Europe. The only remedy for this state of affairs would appear to be as has been already stated, an attempt to preserve Shaikh Abdullah bin Jasim bin Thani and show, in good time, by marjis of oui favour towards him, to Bin Saud that he must reckon on our strong opposition in the event of any intrigues tending to undermine the position of our prestige. I have been warned by Khan Saheb Yusuf bin Ahmad Kanoo that any attempt at a treaty with Abdullah bin Jasim bin Thani alone must be kept secret, as otherwise the Shaikh runs great danger of assassination or, at least, of being ousted by a combination of his relatives against him on the charge 1 of selling his country and their rights to the British. The fact that such an accusation is absurd and rests on no foundation does not make it harder for an Arab to believe. We are therefore faced with a small problem of considerable difficulty. The solution appears to me to lie in support, as strong as we can make it, of Shaikh Abdullah without for the presentpresent asking for any return and trusting to the future to oring us our reward. And here the personal factor comes into play whether Shaikh Abdullah is worth support. I have already mention ed that he appears tractable and well intentioned. The next question - and a most important one for us - is whether he is strong and will be able to make a good use of such aid as we shall give him. Will he be Shaikh Mubarak or Shaikh Isa ? I am afraid that I must here plead guilty to absolute ignorance of his character and, as I am not sure that any other political officer in the Gulf is in a position to give a more satisfactory reply to the question I have posed above, nothing but personal acquaintance with the Shaikh himself is likely to enable us to form a reliable judgment. Personal acquaintance with the Shaikh is also calculated to lead us to satisfactory conclusions as to what form the support to him, on which I have already laid stress ; should take, for I must confess that I am not in a position at present to put forward any definite proposals on this point any more than I can form an accurate estimate of the Diiainh s personal qualities. On both these points we require xuiler information. While I am unable to submit more than the general lines of the policy on which I venture to think we should embark, I can, with some confidence, state that the present seems a favourable opportunity for the inception of that policy. Shaikh Abdullah bin Jasim bin Thani has recently addressed an appeal for advice to Khan Saheb Yusuf bin Ahmad Kanoo which seems to me to show the great need in which he stands of assistance, and. now fully ne realises that need. A translation of this appeal was hurriedly transmitted to me at the moment of closing the mails by the Political Agent and, though the English is crude and faulty, evidently clerk*s work, as I have not the original Arabic to refer to, I have considered it advisable to enclose a true copy as an appendix to this report. The meaning is clear enough. The answer I propose to send to this appeal is indicated in the following paragraph. YourYour telegram No. 588-S dated August 18th to my address appears to put the possibility of my making- any long stay at Qatar out of the question. I would therefore propose to leave the report on the questions I have indicated to the Political Agent, Bahrain. Should he form a favourable opinion of the Shaikh^ qualifications and power to rule, he might then sound him as to what form of support would be most useful to him and report, giving at the same time his own opinion. He might also indicate confidentially to the Shaikh the nature of the payment in the shape of a treaty which we shall at the propwr time when the Shaikh’s power is firmly established, require for our services (vide enclosures to my No. Of 52 dated 21st July 1914;. Captain Keyes has so far had only a comparatively limited experience of Arab Chiefs but, since his arrival at Bahrain, he has thrown himself con amore into all the questions connected with his charge, and 1 consider that ne can safely be relied on to form an accurate estimate of the qualifications and necessities of Shaikh Abdullah. He will, I hope, receive valuable assistance from Khan Saheb Susuf bin Ahmad Kanoo. Should, therefore, the Government of India agree generally with the conclusions I have reached in the above statement of the Qatar problem, I have the honour to request tnat I may be favoured with sanction to the despatch of Captain Keyes on the mission I have assigned to him. On receipt of this sanction Captain Keyes to whom a copy of this letter is being forwarded, could arrange by correspondence for a meeting with ohaiicn Abdullah bin Jasim bin Thani when I could place the E.I.M.S. 'Lawrence' at the disposal of the Political Agent for the purposes of the meeting. I have, etc., Sd. S. G. Knox, Major, Offg.

I temm had been waiting for it from you* Now some friction has occurred from the side of my cousins. My brother Khalifah is with them in this matter. The cause of all this is that I do not agree with them in highhandedness. They do not care for a woman or a subject or any foreigner. Daily they commit more and more highhandedness. I do not agree with them at all, because such things do not last long. If right is proved against one I wish to make him to pay it according to justice, they stand up against it and insist in not paying up the right. Neither they nor Khalifah will pay. All this time I had been trying to facilitate and brush up the matter, thinking that perchance God will lead them to the right path. Their opinion is that of Khalifa’s. This intrigue has made the thing worse. Now I have shown myself angry with them. Possibly they will collect and come to me. Khalifah may or may not come with them. But if they come, they will say something of highhandedness as mischief is their habit and they would not leave such a habit on which they had been brought up. Perhaps you will hear from some people that I wish to change my residence from here to another place. Mind that won’t be right. Nor that my object is. i consult you and ask you to let me know what your opinion and view is. 1 cannot do without your opinion in this and other matters. I will after wards make up my opinion.

Sir, The attitude of Bin Sand towards British authorities and British interests as a result of his recent settlement with the Turks is a subject of sufficient interest to make it unnecessary for me to preface a report tnereon with any long preamble setting forth the reasons that have induced me to submit such a document. 2. I have recently requested the views of the political Agents of Bahrain and Kuwait on this question ano. theL reports have now reached me. The Political Agent, Bahrain, expresses the opnion that Bin Baud does not consider that the settlement he has made with the Turks is due to our friendly representations. The Amir, he thinks, prides himself on having skilfully played the British off against Turkey and, hy causing Turkey to imagine that he was considering the advisability of applying for British protection and guidance, extracted better terms than he would otherwise have obtained. The i Political Agent adds that, if he has gauged correctly Bin : Baud's attitude of mind, the latter will certainly not himself beholden to us, nor that he has anything from us. He proceeds 'In matters concerning' our s in A1 Hasa, Bin Baud will probably endeavour to steert steer a safe course between offending us by obstruction, and local susceptibilities, (to which. I would add, Turkish susceptibilities) by appearing to be subservient to our wisheso The Political Agent, Kuwait, on the other hand, relying chiefly on the opinions delivered by Shaikh Sir MhaMk/vklK Mubarak bin Subah, hazards the following indications as to Bin Saud 1 s probable attitude: 'Bin Saud T s feeling towards the British are unchanged# He considers that all questions, concerning foreign traders in, or visitors to, Najd and A1 Hasa, are to be settled by him alone without reference to Constantinople# This view would appear to be correct, provided that the requests of such persons are in accordance with treaty provisions, vide #he communication from Hakki Pasha, detailed in foreign Department | telegram No* 428-S*, dated 10th July last® , is unlikely * that Bin Saud attributes his settlemenu with the lurkish Government to our previous efforts on his behali, uiough ne may perhaps be aware that the satisfactory terms he has obtained are in part due to our presence in the field# The arrangement between Bin Saud and Turkey is not likely to be of long duration according to the specific expectations of the former, who is not believed here (i.e* at Kuwait) to have become a pro Turk, tqhave been in the least affected by the pan-Islamic sentiments of Anwar Pasha or to have ceased to regard the interests of himself and his people as paramount'* 3. It will be seen that the Bahrain and Kuwait views differ little, though the latter is slightly more pro hnglisn and anti Turkish than the former* This is only natural as tinged with that violent hatred of the Turk which is so marked a characteristic of the Shaikh of Kuwait# My personal opinion } inclines to the Kuwait view, and I look upon a reconciliation ! 0 f Turkish and Najd interests as impossible* Whether it will ! be more easy to reconcile British and Najd interests is to my mind unfortunately almost as doubtful* The first rock on whichwhich we shall split will he Qatar and the Qatar problem appears to me as insistent as any we have to deal with for the moment on the Arabian shores of the Gulf* It is not, however, easy to see how leisure can be found just now to deal with this petty but intricate problem* Fortunately up to the present, no confirmation has been received of the rumour reported under the heading 'Qatar” in Bushire summary for the period ending with the 31st August; and it may, therefore, I hope be discredited* There is no doubt that the death of Shaikh Abdullah bin Jasim would but add to the difficulties of a solution. 4* i»hile I have no wish to appear to run counter to the policy declared from home of not adding to Turkey*s diffi culties nor of running the risk of severing Arabia from the Empire, I cannot refrain from pointing out the danger of leaving Bin Saud and the Shaikh of Qatar entirely to their own devices, a policy which, it seems to me, can only result - and at no distant date - in our being presented with a 'fait accompli” in the annexation of Qatar. 5* From Qatar to the Trucial Coast is but a step and, however difficult it may be to keep Bin Saud out of Qatar, it will be doubly difficult to turn him out of Qatar once he is there, and such an undertaking would undoubtedly embitter MS our relations with him permanently and would, therefore, be greatly to be regretted* 6. The present turn of affairs in Europe, so favourable to the Slavs and so destructive of German influence, to which the young Turk party have recently been looking’ as their strongest support against the hostile elements wnich they imagine — not without reason - to threaten them, encourages me to hope that a strong reversion to Anglophile feeling may be the next feature of Turkish policy. It might, therefore, be possible, even at some risk of exciting Turkish suspicion, to proceed quietly with our settled policy in the Persian Gulf of preservingL preserving, so far as is humanly possible, the status quo and therefore the independence of Qatar® In this policy, it is of course needless to remark, no hostility/to Turkey finds a place* 7* I therefore make bold to solicit the permission of Government to proceed with the steps advocated in correspondence ending with my No* Cf*52 dated 21st July last, and also that the Political Agent, Bahrain, may be directed discreetly to pursue the policy of keeping in touch with events in A1 Hasa MS and Bin Baud’s subordinates in that province* It is even worthy of consideration, I venture to suggest, whether a warning might not be addressed to the Amir implying that son and lawful heir of the late Shaikh, had, in accordance with universal custom, succeeded to the Shaikhdom; that his maintenance in that position and the independence of the Shaikh of Qatar were objects of their solicitude and that they hoped that any malcontents of his family who were shortsighted enough not to perceive that their true interests lay in the enhancement of the dignity and position of the head of their family, would receive no encouragement at the hands of the Amir or from his officials® 8® I hope that a letter on these lines would make the Amir pause and that such a communication, combined with closer relations on our part with the Bin Thani family, would go far to prevent a break in the friendly relations with Bin Saud which must, for some time - and we may hope permanently - form the cardinal feature in our policy in that quarter of the Persian Gulf® discussions in the family of the late Shaikh Jasim bin Abdullah bin Thani; that the new Shaikh, Abdulla £ the eldest I have, etc*, Sd/~ S.

In amplification of my telegram No. 812, dated 21st July 1914 to your address l have the honour to forward herewith the promised draft agreement and notification which l propose when duly authorised by Government to do s.o, to endeavour to obtain from Shaikh Abdullah bin Jasim bin Fhani. ! he draft has been prepared from the material at my disposal in Sir Percy Cox’s despatch to the Government of India dated 22nd June 1913 on this subject and Government of India telegram dated 1 ith September 1913 to the Marquess of Crewe together with the considerable light, thrown on the attitude and intentions of the A 1 Tham family by Sir Percy Cox’s earlier despatch to the Secretary to the Government ot India in the Foreign Department, No. 755, dated 2nd March 19 &lt;3. 2. It appears to me to be a matter for considerarion on the spot whether the Treaty should be made with the natural head of the Jamdy only, s h all jh Abdullah bin Jasim bin Than! or whether the other sons of old Shaikh Jasim should sign also. It would no doubt be preferable to deal with one mar b 01 J l y t0 P re ‘ vent family squabbles in regard to the distribution of the subsidy I propose should be granted, but the local situation may render this unsatisfactory. Some latitude should also, l venture to submit, be given to me m regard to he amount of the subsidy and possibly with regard to the question of the settlement of a compassionate allowance to Salih al Mana, the Qatar owner of the d^w, men tioned in Foreign Department telegram No. S -497 dated 26th August to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, in case that question is raised. O It will be noted that the draft agreement falls naturally into three por- tionsf of which the ist and second must be secured, if we are h ^^nyth ng tangible from the Shaikh of Qatar in the way of a Treaty The^thwd^tmn contains several clauses that might be dropped if t e sfJm a D itv not to I have enclosed these portions in brackets.

The number of arms, thus annually imported shall not exceed 1,000 rifles per annum with 400 rounds of ammunition per rifle and two pistols shall, for this pur pose, be considered as equivalent to one rifle. The British Government, on its side, in consideratron of the undertaking into which 1 now enter, agrees to pay me a subsidy of Rs. 1,000 per mensem, to be paid regularly to me, or to my duly authorised agent at Bahrein through the Political Agent, Bahrein. . I, Shaikh Abdulla, further, in particular, undertake to receive, should the British Government deem it advisable, an Agent from the British Government who shall remain at A 1 Bidaa for the transaction of such business as the British Government may have with me and to watch over the interests of British traders, residing at my Ports or visiting them upon their lawful occasions. The Customs import dues upon British Goods shall not exceed those levied from my own subjects on their goods and shall in no case exceed 5 per cent ai valorem, British subjects and their goods shall be liable to the payment of no other dues, taxes, or service of any other kind whatsoever beyond that already specified.

On their part, the High British Government, in consideration of these Treaties and Engagements that I have entered into with them, undertakes to protect me and my subjects and territory from all aggression by sea and to do their utmost to exact reparation for all injuries that I, or my subjects, my suffer when proceeding to sea upon our lawful occasions. They also undertake to grant me good offices, should I or my subjects be assailed by land within the territories of Qatar. It is, however, thoroughly under stood that this obligation rests upon the British Government only in the event of such aggression, whether by land or sea, being unprovoked by any act or aggression on the part of myself or my subjects against others. In token whereof, I, Major S. G. Knox, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and l, Shaikh Abdulla bin Jasim bin Thani, have respectively signed and affixed our seal to this original document and four copies thereof. Whereas it has become known to us that the traffic in Arms into British i India, Persia, Kuwait, Bahrein and the Trucial Coast is prohibited, I, the undersigned, Abdullah bin Jasim bin Thani, Shaikh of Qatar, have decided to do all in my power to assist the British Government in putting a stop to this illegal traffic and I hereby declare that, from the date of this proclamation, the impoitation of Arms, Cartridges and all munitions into our territory and the exportation of the same to other places are absolutely prohibited All Arms and Ammunition, imported into Qatar territory or exported theretrom, will, in future, be liable to seizure, and confiscation.

Foreign Secret. My telegram of 13th August. El Katr. Cox who recently visited A1 Bida and informed Sheikh that arrangements were being made for withdrawal of Turkish garrison reports as follows :— “ Sheikh had already read in newspapers report of conclusion of Con vention and intention to withdraw Turkish garrison but Turkish gunboat had recently arrived with some months’ rations for garrison and Captain assured him that there was no truth whatever in the statement regarding their withdrawal. I therefore gave him intimation in writing. “ According to his account his position as regards Bin Sand is as follows. On Jasim’s death Bin Sand wrote to Abdullah asking him to come and see him and saying if friendship was to be maintained he must get rid of Turkish garrison. Abdullah replied that garrison was quite innocuous and that it would only hostilise Turkish Government to expel them, but that he undertook neither to allow garrison to be increased nor Turks to use Katr as abase. As regards visit to Bin Sand he made excuse of his father’s death for postponing it. He continued that his elder half-brother, Khalifah, had visited Bin Sand and professed to have spoken in same sense, but Abdullah could not be absolutely sure of him. In any case Abdullah said that if Bin Sand seriously intended to occupy Katr he doubted whether they could keep him out even if he and his brothers were all united. He thought a warning from us might perhaps keep him away from A1 Bida but would not prevent him from engineering Bedouin raids into Katr. “ He said he appreciated recognition of independence now accorded, and was in any case ready to co-operate in the matter of arms traffic, provided we would give him facilities for supplying his own legitimate needs, but apart from that he hoped we would not be in a hurry to press on him alterations in conditions at present existing. The fact is that between Bin Sand and the Turks and ourselves he does not quite know where he is.” In the circumstances it is clearly desirable to avoid haste and to defer action as regards treaties for the present. Delay in the matter will also accord with wish of Foreign Office that an interval should be allowed to elapse between publication of Anglo-Turkish agreements and conclusion of treaty with Sheikh. When Sheikh’s position is assured, our relations with Bin Saud defined, and El Katr affairs have had time to settle, we are of opinion that suitable opportunity might be taken .to conclude treaty generally on lines sketched by Cox in his letter No. 1963, dated 22nd June, copy forwarded with Foreign Secretary’s letter, 30 M. 24th July. In return for assurances of our protection by sea and good offices in case of unprovoked attack by land, Sheikh should be required to receive British Agent, to co-operate in suppression of arms traffic, and to engage not to enter into relations with, receive representative of, or cede territory to any other Power than British, or to grant concessions or monopolies or right to land sea cables without our consent. As regards maritime, trucial, and slave trade, agree ment should resemble substantially those entered into with Trucial Chiefs. Remaining desiderata mentioned by Cox could be secured later.Telegram - P. Enclosure ’^ter from Fc — '^ S-cretvry, India.

From— Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Cox, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department* Simla. I have the honour to reply to Foreign Department Telegram No. 140 -S., dated 29 th May, asking my views as to the steps which can best be taken in order to enable us to obtain full advantage from the new position which we are acquiring in relation to the Katar Peninsula under the Anglo-Turkish Convention now on the point of conclusion, 2 . At the moment, the subject is rendered a little complicated by an independent development, namely, the expulsion of the Turks from Hasa and Katif and the assumption of the control of that province by Bin Saud. Mean while the Porte shows no sign of removing their garrison from A1 Bidaa, and indeed I doubt whether Shaikh Jasim would readily part with it at present, for in the absence of the Turkish garrison or of assurances from us to supply the place of it, he would not unnaturally feel somewhat apprehensive of being absorbed by Bin Saud. \ &gt; For this reason I am inclined to think that another meeting with him at an early date is advisable either on the part of the Political Agent, Bahrain, or myself, for the purpose of explaining to him the gist of the Anglo-Turkish Con vention so far as it concerns Katar an,d Bahrain, and in order to see what we are likely to get him to accept in the direction of closer relations with us. The inability to give him any reply on the subject of the Arms Traffic Subsidy will be a little inconvenient, but I think it will be possible to^ make him understand that this matter is connected with our current negotiations with the French Government and that the consideration of it necessarily takes a long time. It seems possible that the said negotiations with France may have advanced somewhat in the last few weeks and that the horizon may be clearer for a con sideration of the Katar question ; in any case, presuming that the Convention with Turkey admits of it, it will probably be necessary to give Shaikh Jasim a | subsidy in some form. 3 . As soon as the ground is sufficiently prepared, I am of opinion that we should make a treaty with Shaikh Jasjm by which we should jecogmse his autonomy, give him assurances of protection, (so long as he observes his obliga tions to us) from attack by sea, and good offices to prevent _ unprovoked attack by land (by Bin Saud for instance) and should in return require from him under takings under the following heads, so far as proves possible. (i) To receive an Agent of the British Government of India at A1 Bidaa ; (for the present a Mohammedan Agent of the type of the dency Agent at Lingah, working immediately under the Political Agent at Bahrain). (ii) To allow British Indians to reside in the Katar ports for trade, and to afford protection for their lives and properties. (iii) Not to levy duty at more than 5 per cent ad valorem. rjyj To render co-operation generally for the preservation of the V Maritime Truce, apd in particular for the suppression of the Slave Trade, Piracy and the Arms Traffic. (v) To issue a prohibition against the import or sale of Arms and Ammunition in Katar territory except under special license. (yi) To undertake not to allow foreigners including British subjects, to 1 acquire monopolies or concessions ; or to acquire pearling rights or use diving dresses in his waters, without the cognizance and approval of the British Government.2 (vii) Not to admit the Agent of any Power other than Great Britain (and ' ! Turkey ?) and not to correspond with the officials of any other Power without the cognizance,!and concurrence of the British Authorities. fviii) To receive and protect a British Post Office and Telegraph installa- k tion (as at Kuwait and Bahrain) whenever the British Govern- ment consider that the step is needed. 4 . It goes without saying that we should go slow in working for these desiderata and that we could not expect to obtain them all at once, even in prin ciple. It does not seem to me that any of the items are incompatible with the terms of the Convention with Turkey, but this is a point for the consideration of higher authority. The first three necessary steps seem to be to explain the situation to Shaikh Jasim and his son in charge of Doha; to get rid of the Turkish garrison and then get our Residency Agent installed. I presume that His Majesty s^ Government will take steps to expedite the withdrawal of the garrison, as soon as the Convention is finally accepted ; meanwhile the Government of India will perhaps feel able to authorise me to put the other two steps in hand, informing me at the same time whether any communication can be made to him with reference to my letter No* 755i dated 2nd March .. 19 * 3 * on object of an Arms Traffic Subsidy. 5 . I am forwarding a copy of this letter to the Political Agent, Bahrain, for his information and any observations he may wish to make.■tom</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000419.0x000119_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/10/386</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x000119</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/10/386</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>File 2182/1913 Pt 3 'Persian Gulf Katr Treaty'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1913/1918</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2016-03-07T15:58:30</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 volume (122 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the volume.The subject 2182 (Persia Gulf) consists of 8 volumes: IOR/L/PS/10/384-391.

It concerns a treaty between Britain and El Katr (also spelled Katar in the file) [Qatar].In a copy of a telegram to the Secretary of State for India, dated 13 August 1913, the Viceroy of India acknowledges the former's wish to negotiate a treaty as soon as Britain's convention with the Turkish government comes into force [the Anglo-Ottoman Convention of 1913, which was never ratified]. However, the Viceroy suggests that, following the recent death of Shaikh Jasim [Shaikh Jāsim bin Muḥammad Āl Thānī, Ruler of Qatar], any action should be deferred until his successor, Shaikh Abdullah [Shaikh ‘Abdullāh bin Jāsim Āl Thānī], has established himself as ruler.The volume contains the following:a draft agreement between the British Government and Shaikh Abdullah;British officials' views on the perceived attitude adopted by Bin Saud [‘Abd al-‘Azīz bin ‘Abd al-Raḥmān bin Fayṣal Āl Sa‘ūd] towards the British authorities and British interests, following his recent settlement with the Turkish government;discussion on the importance of concluding negotiations with Bin Saud prior to completing a treaty with El Katr;the ejection of the Turkish garrison from El Katr;discussion as to whether to retain an arms traffic clause in the draft agreement, following the near collapse of arms traffic during the first year of the First World War;an account of treaty negotiations between the Political Agent, Kuwait (Lieutenant-Colonel William George Grey, accompanied by the Bahrain Political Agent Major Terence Humphrey Keyes) and Shaikh Abdullah;a copy of the final treaty, signed on 3 November 1916 and ratified on 23 March 1918.The volume features the following principal correspondents:Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Zachariah Cox, and Major Stuart George Knox, officiating Resident in Cox's absence);Viceroy of India [Charles Hardinge; Frederic John Napier Thesiger];Secretary of State for India (Robert Offley Ashburton Crewe-Milnes, 1st Marquess of Crewe; Joseph Austen Chamberlain; Edwin Samuel Montagu);Foreign Office;Secretary to the Government of India's Foreign and Political Department [Alfred Hamilton Grant];Political Agent, Kuwait (Lieutenant-Colonel William George Grey).The part includes a divider that gives the subject and part number, the year the subject file was opened, the subject heading, and a list of correspondence references contained in the part by year.
