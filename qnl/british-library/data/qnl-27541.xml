My dear George Many thanks for your letter E 1500/247/91 of March 14th and the enclosed copy of the 1906 print concerning relations Between His Majesty’s Government and the Trucial Sheykhs. I note the points about the 1856 and 1879 agreements. I had overlooked the fact that the latter does not appear in other collections, including that communicated to Ihn Saud in 1927. In the same order of ideas, Philhy recently mentioned to me a handbook on the Persian Gulf prepared under the direction of the Historical Section of the Foreign Office No. 76 and published by the Stationery Office in 1920* He said it contained some document or statement admitting Ibn Saud’s rights over Qatar and expressed astonishment at its having been made public. Fuad, who, I gather, has a copy, mentioned it to me also on April 5th but more guardedly. He spoke of the handbook as in one place admitting Ibn Saud’s right to Qatar but as giving some other version elsewhere. This is not very important in present circumstances but, as I do not possess the book, I should like to know whether it does in fact contain anything which might be used to our disadvantage.

My dear George, The following may be of some interest to you and the India Officer- On February 6th or 7th Fuad Bey mentioned to me an address by the late Lord Curzon to the Trucial Sheykhs, which he said was very interesting. I admitted that I was unfamiliar with it, whereupon he offered to lend me a print containing it. He has done so and I have returned it. I do not think I have ever before seen the print in question. The front page of Fuad^ copy is mutilated as the top has been torn off and there are two erasures in the middle. This leaves the title 'Existing Treaties between 'the British Government and the Trucial Chiefs. 1906'; the royal arms; and an Arabic title underneath. The print contains, in English and Arabic, Lord Curzon 1 s address to the Chiefs at a Public Durbar at Shargah on November 21st, 1903, and other texts of eight agreements and engagements, which were in force on January 1st, 1906. You doubtless know the address, though I did not. Fuad rightly describes it as very interesting. The Marquess, like so many after him, used the words 'protection' and 'independence' almost in the same breath, stressing perhaps protection a little more than independence, but promising in terms that, if the Chiefs observed their engagements, 'there 'is no fear that any one else will be allowed to tamper with 'your/ G.W. Rendel, Esq., C.M.G., Foreign Office.'your rights and liberties'. Two of the eight treaties etc. in the print are, I think, unfamiliar to me. One is a 'Further Engagement' entered into in 1856 by Bin Suggur and four other chiefs, for the more effectual suppression of the Slave Trade. I cannot identify this with any of the treaties etc. communi cated to Ibn Saud in 1927. The other is a Mutual Agreement concluded among the Chiefs themselves, under British auspices on June 24th, 1879. It is particularly interesting to note that the text in this print of the identic engagement entered into by the Chiefs in March 1892 about foreign relations, etc., is given under the general heading 'Protectorate Treaties, 1892' in the English; whereas the longer Arabic heading describes the document without using the words 'protection' or 'protectorate'. I am sending copies of this letter to Metcalfe and Fowle . Yours ever, fSgd.) ANDREW RYAN/ t COPY. FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l. 14th March, 1935. My dear Andrew, Many thanks for your interesting confidential letter No. 360/229/7 of the 14th February to me, in which you describe a print document of 1906 concerning relations between His Majesty^ Government and the Trucial Sheikhs, a copy of which was lent to you by Fuad Hamza. I enclose for your archives a spare copy of this document, which the Library have supplied. The 1856 Agreement appears to be the same as that given as No. IX on page 234 of Aitchison, Volume XI. (Actually, in Aitchison, it is given as signed by the Sheikh of Bahrain, but a footnote states that a similar engagement was entered into by the Sheikhs of Ras al Khaimah, Umm el Qawain, Libai, Ajman and Abu Dhabi). The 1879 treaty we do not remember having seen. It should be interesting to know how Fuad got hold of his copy. I am asking the Library whether they can offer any suggestions on this point.

The despatch indicates how strongly Uol. Loch feels regarding the Basidu incident, and contains expressions which will not be very agreeable to the F.O. No action, however, appears to be called for on the despatch. We can pass over the suggestions that H.M.G.’s attitude towards Persia is one of undue humility, etc. Uol. Loch naturally considers matters primarily from the Arab point of view. Possibly (his experience of the Gulf not being very recent) he has not been inclined to give sufficient weight to the difficulties of H.l-.G.'s policy in Persia. Uol. Fowle, who is naturally able to take a more balanced view of Gulf politics, will be back at his post (in which Uol. Loch has been acting) in a fortnight’s time. The despatch itself is addressed to the G. of I., ilr t and can be treated as an ordinary report which calls for no comment Uu. , As regards the address to the Trucial Sheikhs at Debai, the announcement at the end of the address was in the terms which Col. Loch was instructed to use, after consultation with the F.O. (see the d.o. correspondence below). Some of the language of the remainder of the address may be regarded by the F.O. as unduly Curzonian; out on the whole the address should have a good effect. Col. Loch made much of the occasion, but not more, I think, than was justified by the circumstances. The decision to send the flotilla to the Persian Gulf was taken 1712n 5000 3/33 for/mmm MipPf 1 for the purpose of calming and reassuring the Arabs, who - particularly on the Trucial Coast - have been disturbed by rumours resulting from the Persian action at Basidu. There is no object, however, in publishing the address, as suggested in Col. Loch's separate express letter; indeed, there are reasons against doing so. A draft telegram, in which the F.O. concur by telephone, is submitted.

Y he usual repairs hays been done to the British Cemetery. Bince the incident the Guard House has been cleaned up for the Maral Guard and the pier,which had fallen into some disrepair, was put into proper order, 5, Tn the Cemetery there is an Obelisk, on ^ileh are graven on slabs of hard stone the names of those #iose hea stones have become worn in the passing of time. This Obelisk was raised by the Government of India in 1913, and bears the significant legend Lest the 13 fcst be forgotten British Basidu About mid-day the Residency Agent arrived by 6 Plying Boat, kindly placed at my disposal for the purpose by the Air Officer Commanding, ’Iraq Command, to discuss the arrangements for the cruise of the ^irst “Destroyer flotilla on the 'rucial Coast. A provisional programme was drawn up in consultation with the Senior Kaval Officer and the Residency Agent was flown back to ^ibai, with instructions to make the preliminary arrangements for a gathering of the ^rucial Chiefs at Bibai for a Oarbar and Naval Display. 7* Immediately after the departure of the iH.ying Boat H.H.R^owey sailed for Henjam, which was reached at 2000 hours on the 13th September, and the next day was spen t/T #B./ @&gt; ■ pent in mnkin* Tarlouo arrangement a. 8* At alsout 1230 hours on the 13th September the T?ir»t T)eatroyer ^otilla reached Henjan ard dropped ainchor in formation, ' n he ^haildi of Dibai, ^io eaa hunting on Qishm Island t was inwlted by the Senior Naral Officer to watch the arrival of the ^otilla from the bridge of Shoreham, He appeared to be much impressed* 9, Immediately on the arrival of the flotilla the first Incident in connection with their cruise took place. Arrangements had been made on the 13th September by the Senior Haval Officer for the Quarantine Medical Officer to visit the flotilla Leader, where the Bills of Health for the remainder of the Squadron would be collected in accordance with the usual custom. The Quarantine Medical Officer wae offered a launch to tow his nulling boat out to the flotilla Leader, and accepted gratefully. On the 15th September, however, he stated that he had received orders from the Beputy Governor that he was not to grant pratique to the ■“flotilla. It was clearly Impossible to allow the flotilla to be held up at the outset of their cruise in the Persian Gulf, or to defer completing oil and granting shore leave to the men. In the circumstances, and in view of the fact that information had been received that both the Arslan Government and the Governor of the Gulf !3 orts had Issued orders for the grant of facilities, the Senior Naval Officer, ■ having assured himself of the health of the flotilla, sent the Bills of Health to the deputy Governor, with a verbal intimation that he had assumed pratique. The incident has been reported by telegram. 10. I then had the opportunity of meeting Commanderv -4- T t ifoo was ir command of the ^otllla In the absence of Cantain C.^.Ha^rls, and came on 'board to call upon the Senior TTawal Officer and mysel^* 11. On the afternoon of the 15th fleptember, the Senior TUiYal Officer, Commander '^e 11 owes and I went on shore to see the pier, coal sheds, canteens and oth*»r buildings at Henjam. No Persian Officials were to be seen, but the Persian police were careful to salute. IS. On the morning of the 16th September the Commanding Officers of the 'beatroyers called upon the Senior Naral Officer and myself, and in the evening I had the pleasure of meeting them at a dinner given by the Senior Haval Officer. 13. On the 17th September, accompanied by my Secretary (Lieutenant A,Stewart) X returned the call of Commander ^ellowes, and of the Commanding Officers of the 'Soatroysrs, in K.W.S, 'Puncan. Hie Political Resident’s salute was fired by H.M.S.^owey as the 'Oestroyers do not fire salutes. After my call was over, a morning 'At Home' was held in H .M. S. Shoreham. 14. On the 17th September the ^enuty Gov* r nor,Hen Jam, sent a verbal message by a '’oliceman to the'Clerk in Charge to say that he had received Instructions to peimit the Flotilla to anchor. 15. On the nitfit of the lSth/19th September the Squadron proceeded to Basldu, *here all was found to be In order. I gathered from enquiries mads by the Head Muntfii of the Bahrain Agency (an Arab) who was with me and was un known locally, that the inhabitants were heartened by the sight of the Hotilla, but are terrified that they will eventually be left to the mercies of the Persians.

Owing to the otate of the tide it waa necessary to land ov^r a mile from the Mali’s ^ort, and he met our party on the shore with a concourse of armed men, a band and dancing slaves, 4 number of swordsmen ran to and fro before us flinging their swords hiflh in the air and catching them again as they fell. In the picturesque setting of a palm fringed bay between gaunt rocky headlands and with a background of forbidding mountains, the scenewas barbaric, a last ralic of the olden days. At the ^ort we were regaled with the usual oof fee and sweetmeats, and on leaving three ancient guns, half buried in the earth, were fired as a mark of honour. ^e all said that the coming of the flotilla had brought Joy to himself and our friends, but had been a blow to the faction who oppose him. He mentioned certain suboIcIous Persians who had Just left, and an Individual passing himself off as an Afghan, who was thought locally to be a spy. I remarked that if he was a spy, he had in truth seen many wonderful ships. 19. After a sultry night at Khassab, the Squadron weighed anchor on the morning of the 81st and dispersed, H.If.S.Shoreham and four Destroyers to Abu Musa Island, and H.M.S.^owey and four Destroyers (one had gone to Henjam for mails) to '■'anb Island. nothing of note occurred at either place, and the Shaikh of Sharjah’s flag was flying on Abu Husa Island. SO. On the SSnd September the Ships which had been to Tanb Island rejoined us at sea and the entire Squadron proceeded to Dibai and anchored in the forenoon. Yhe Residency Agent came on board and it was then learnt that the Shaikh of had not returned from (iiehra, where he had been hunting. later it transpired that his motor dhow had broken down. 'Tie clutch had been givipg trouble and, though a temporary repair had been effected for the Shaikh by H.M.S.fthoreham at Henjam, a heavy swell probably proved too much for it, so that the Shaikh was prevented from attending the ~^arbar. 7*his event is the more to be regretted, as had we known of itf sooner, the Senior Naval Officer would kindly have given a passage to the Shaikh in one of His Majesty’s/Majesty’s Ships* 21* On the evening of the 23rd September Air Officer Cownandlng,’Iraq Command, (Air Vice f arshal { '.S* Burnett, C.^., B.S.O.), arrived by ^ngoon at Bibai, accompanied by his Aide-de-Camp( 1? lif^t Lieutenant L, B a rrall, M.C.) and by the Officer Commanding 203 (^.B.) Squadron (Group Captain W.L.Welsh, ' n *F*C.,A*F*C*) # The Air Officer Commanding nas escorted by a Squadron of Wapitis, which proceeded to Sharjah* 22. On the 23rd September, with the permission *f the Senior Haval Officer, ^ersian Gulf division, a Barbar was held on the quarterdeck of H.Jf.S.Shoreham, which was decorated with flags and provided with suitable seating accommodation for the more important guests and with nigs for their followers* As explained above, the ShaiVh of TUbai was absent owing to the breakdown of his motor dhow, and the Chief of Bas al Khaimah, though he had been persuaded by the Beaidency Agent to come to Bibai, took fright ^ien he saw the Squadron (he has for the moment an uneasy con science) fearing that he might be carried away* The Chiefs of Abu Bhabi, Sharjah, Ajman, and Umsi al Qaiwain were present and the Shaikh of Dibai was represented by a relative. A copy is enclosed of the programme of the Barbar and of the Address, which I made to the Chiefs. It is too early to gauge the effect of the pronouncement of the policy of His Majesty’s Government contained in my address, but immediately after I had finished, while coffee was being served, each Chief conveyed to me a message of thanks and satisfaction* I think that the effect/-PU •ffect of the pronouncement will he excellent, provided that the confidence of the Chiefe la not a#&amp;ln ehaken hy an unhappy aolutlon of the incident, hy a failure to obtain reparation or apology in the eeveral dhow incldenta or hy a renewal of the activities of the ,3 erBian Navy. If we fail to show determination in our relation*! with ^ereia. the pronouncement, and the circuraatancee in which it waa delivered,, will he looked upon aa inaincere, our influence will decline and the general situation will become worse than ever# 23. After the Tiarbar, the Chiefs proceeded one hy one, Under their respective salutes, from H.M.S.Uhoreham to H.M.fl. Pi amend, Some little persuasion was necessary before the Shaikh of Abu Phabi would go, as he was apprehensive lest ill should befall him. The Senior Naval Officer had arranged for them to he shown target practice with the 4,7* guns and a smoke screen, and finally to pass at high speed close to the target ship, from which, as we passed, a hurst of machine gun fire was directed into our wake. The Squadron of Wapitis flew in formation from the direction of Sharjah. The guests were at first dour and Inclined to suspect our purpose in carrying them out to sea at such speed. The guns awed, hut Impressed them, and the machine gun filled them with delight. By the end of the morning they seemed quite at home and completely finished the refreshments provided, besides the entire supply of ice and iced water in the Ship, I think that the experience has made a deep impression upon them. 24. A* in the case of the pronouncement at the Parhar, I would venture to warn Government that the ultimate effect of the cruise will depend on whether or not we show deter mination/-9- determination in our relations wHh ? ern i a . I hone thst it mill not be understood from this that I advocate a policy of force alone, for I do not. But I t&gt;wt we nay shoe clearly that *e are able and Intend to protect our subjects and our Interests, and those of the Rulers who have Placed their foreign affairs In our hands, and that we may discard that attitude of humility. Khlch has brought about an insult to our nag. such as would hawe been un- drea*i+ of ten year* ago. 2 p. On the e Yen inf? of the S3rd September the Senior Hawal Officer, Persian Oulf Ttlvlslon, held a dinner in ra style for the Chiefs and their more important followers, which passed off happily, though two of the more corpulent guests of the morning found themselves indisposed! On the evening of the P3rd September, after dinner, I left in H.V.S.^owey for Bushlre and the Squadron was to proceed to Aba 'ThaM the next morning. 26. Tn conclusion, I venture to bring to the notice Of Government the very real help and kindness that I have received from the Senior Naval Officer, 'ersian Gulf division, and all under Mb conwand during the cruise of the yirat hestroyer flotilla to Nasidu and -the rucial Coast. '110 general arrangements for the eruiae, 'or exchanges of visits and for the Tiarbar and Naval 'tsplay at T&gt;lhal were admirable, and I have especially to acknow ledge the eheerful and willing way in which the Cypher and Wireless branches of the Senior Naval Officer'? Staff assisted my own staff In dealing with the vast telegraphic correspondence which this unhappy incident has brought forth.

Loch's purpose, since it contains not merely an affirmation of policy, but of the obligations towards the Sheikhs which rest upon the British Govt. Since, therefore, the F.O. are anxious to substitute a formula on these lines, we may agree? of Col.

Department. 1925 5000 6.33 21 SEP W55 My dear Rendel, Many thanks for your letter of 19th Sept., No. E 5484/1273/34, regarding Loch's proposal to reaffim: Lord Curzon's statement of policy of 1903. We do not think that there can be any question of disapproving Loch's intention to hold a durbar at Debai ■ _ (you will have noticed that he did not submit this for sanction, but only the question of reaffirming Lord Curzon's assurance). A durbar is quite an ordinary and routine method of transacting business in the Indian States, or on the Trucial Coast or elsewhere m the sphere for which the G. of I. are responsible. Their officers are,^of-eoart&gt;e^. familiar with the procedure, and we do not regard this proposal as anything out of the -OJ^Linary-, nor, of course, as in any way comparable with the durbar which the Viceroy, on the special occasion of his visit to the Persian Gulf, held at Shargah in 1903. On the other hand, the whole object of the circular^the issue of which has been authorised, and of the visit of the flotilla to the Persian Gulf, is to reassure the Arabs/rsa.) j, a w ujUBt Arabs, and it is almost inevitable that the acting Resident, who is going to the Trucial Coast (presumably for the primary purpose of distributing the circular), should hold a meeting of the Sheikhs and make a speech suitable to the occasion. As regards the form of words to be used, though we think Loch’s proposal quite harmless, we are willing to meet your views and to instruct him to employ the formula suggested in my letter of 18th Sept., with the amendment which you now propose. This, we quite , . think, would be/adequate for Loch s purpose Foreover, in order to put himi on his guard against the possible risks that you foresee,we are asking him to bear in mind some of the considerations that have emerged from the correspondence on the subject.

To be quite frank, we are none of us here altogther happy about the proposal to hold the Durbar at all. The position in the Gulf is so different from that which existed in 1903, and the position of a temporarily acting Resident is necessarily so much less impressive than that of the great Viceroy, that we feel that the whole affair may tend to point a contrast rather than a parallel. Moreover, the international situation in the Gulf is necessarily, at this moment, so delicate and uncertain, that we feel that any statement of any kind may well do more harm than good, and that therefore the less said the J•C• Walton, Esq., C.B., M.C., India Office. bettermam- 2 - ketter. What will count in the Gulf, will be not so much assertions and promises as actual facts; and it is still a little difficult to say exactly what action we shall be able to tal« in any particular set of circumstances, Personally,.1 feel that if we could - for instance - persuade Ibn Saud to raise the Koweit Blockade, or induce the Iraqis to give the Sheikhs of koweit and Mohammerah a square deal over their date-gardens, we should do more to re-establish our prestige in the Gulf than by any number of viceregal speeches, which may only lay up further trouble for us by being misinterpreted either by the Sheikhs in one direction, or by foreign Powers in another. The view here then is that we should much prefer that the Durbar should not take place in present circumstances at all. 3. If, however, it is too late to cancel or postpone the Durbar, we still feel strongly that it would be a mis take for Loch to repeat the form of words used by Lord Gurzon in 1903 in the way in which he proposes. My higher authorities here would indeed prefer to use the formula suggested in paragraph 6 of Warner's letter to you of SeptemberSeptember 16th. But if you still see strong objection to that formula, they would be prepared to agree to the alternative formula suggested in paragraph 6 of your letter of September 18th, subject to a modification of the final phrase (i.e. 'and to maintain the influence of the 'British Government'). In our view that phrase to some extent falls between two stools. Foreign Powers, who, as you know, are becoming increasingly interested in the Gulf, may well regard it as provocative and will certainly read more into it than it is meant to convey; while it is in itself so vague that I cannot believe that it will be of real value to the Sheikhs or to anyone else. Would it not be possible to replace it by some such alternative as 'and 'to maintain their own treaty rights and position'.? 4. I am sorry to have to raise so many objections to Loch*s proposals, but I hope that, if the Durbar must be held and Loch has to make a pronouncement. Sir S.

J.C. Walton.FOREIGN OFFTCE, S.W.l. 16th September, 1933. (E 5414/1273/34) Immediate. My dear Walton, Many thanks for your letter of to-day about the proposal to reaffirm the assurances given by Lord Gurzon in 1903 to the Trucial Sheikhs. 2. .iftiile I admit that we had not taken into A account, when I first spoke to you on the telephone this morning, the bearing of the Exclusive Agreements of 1892, I fear we still feel that it would be greatly preferable to adopt a somewhat more cautious and less sweeping form of assurance. We do not wish to dispute your view that present-day conditions in the Gulf, and the use of the Arabian coast for the Indian air route, render our de facto protection of the Trucial Sheikhs a more practical question than ever before. We feel, however, that there is all the difference between J G. Walton Esq., G.B., M.C.r~! 1 between being ready to protect them to the best of our ability when the critical moment arrives, and giving them spontaneously a comprehensive promise to which they can appeal on all occasions in future. My recollection is that in the interdepartmental discussions which took place last year in connexion with the establishment of the air route on the Arabian coast it was generally felt that we snould be most careful to avoid incorporating in the resulting agreements with the Sheikhs concerned anything in the nature of a comprehensive promise of protection against aggression, and should keep our assurances down to the minimum compatible with the conclusion of the agreements in question. It was then a question of definite written undertakings, it is true; but the assurances which Loch now proposes to give, though not in writing, will none the less be of the most solemn and public character, and we feel that essentially the same considerations our treaty engagements with the Trucial Rulers bind us towmmmm obligation upon us. But the present question appears cw- to us purely r^n^trinn of expediency. Assuming that the results of the Basidu incident it desirable to make some further reassuring pronouncement in addition to the statement already issued* the possible second statement and the intensive showing of the flag in the Gulf by two sloops^ and a destroyer flotilla, is that any reason why we should make a statement which goes to the extreme limit of the widest interpretation of our obiigations. 5. You may perhaps feel that it can do no harm to reiterate an assurance already given once. But Lord Curzon's declaration was a pronouncement of policy which went beyond our strict obligations and its re affirmation now would bind us afresh to pursue a policy towards the Sheikhs which goes beyond our obligations. In our view the circumstances have changed and it is undesirable to do this, in 1903 the Persian Gulf wasa “British lake; the assurance was justified hy our ability to do exactly what we liked there• Now, in our view with a really independent and lively Persia and equally independent Iraq, with international air routes, and large foreign oil interests, the position is completely changed and will chc^jge still further. We should he ill-advised in these circumstances to go out of our way to assure the Arab sheikhs that they can rely on us for complete protection of their interests in all circumstances. (For they would undoubtedly so understand the proposed reaffirmation). For instance, if one of the Trucial dhows is interfered with by a Persian warship on the high seas and a British warship does not happen to be present, all we can do is to enter a protest at Tehran. (Incidentally the evidence is apt to be not very complete which makes it difficult to press our protest very far). It seems to us, therefore, that it could do our prestige no good to give an assurance which the Arabs themselves know^or soon will know that we are not in a position to carry out to the full extent of the interpretation which they will put uponupon it, 6. When we discussed the matter yesterday morning on the telephone you asked that our comments should take the form of a definite and constructive amendment to the proposals already put forward. You know our views on the adequacy of the two written statements which have already been agreed upon in principle, and I need not labour that aspect of the question here. If, however, you feel, as I gather you do, that it is absolutely necessary to make some solemn statement to the Arabs at the forthcoming durbar, we think that it would be preferable, and probably quite as effective in practice, if that statement were to be based specifically on the existing treaty position. The wording which I give below seems to us to meet the case fairly well, though it has been prepared in haste and we are not at all wedded to its precise terms. Eere it is:- ,T His Majesty's Government are mindful of their 'treaties with you ywhich have given you peace and 'protected your coasts for over a century, and they’’are fully prepared to observe the obligations ,T imposed upon them by those treaties*' 7* We feel that some such announcement as this would surely,j%ade in all the solemn circumstances of a durbar, be sufficient to reassure the Arabs, while not committing us to anything outside the scope of the existing treaties. I hope that on reconsideration of the question as a whole you will think so too* I am sorry that we should appear so tiresome, but without any wish to be obstructive we do really feel that Loch*s proposals might involve us in all sorts of awkward and far-reaching consequences which it is difficult to foresee or guard against at such short notice* 8. One other aspect of the matter is perhaps worth mentioning, though it is not from our point of view of great importance; we have always understood that the India office and the Government of India were anxious to avoid any situation which would focus the attention of foreign observers on the special position of Eis Majesty *8~ - Majesty’s Government in the Persian Gulf, is it not possible that an announcement on the lines envisaged by loch would give rise to just such a situation, by creating the suspicion that we were working towards a system of protectorates? definite/ r7\ PJM/EM (13 groups) 4996 DE O Y P H, £ R , OF TE LEGRAM- From (COPIES CIRCULATED) Political Resident in the Persian ,6^° Gulf to Secretary of State for &gt; 1 India* Dated Henjam, 16th September, 1933.

Walton.by/, ^ ^'^—*‘&gt;’1 A-i “L^jJ ^ i k js. ^ ■ J iMjj )s Mr. Warner of the F.O. has raised the point v/hether it is safe, in modem conditions in the Gulf, to repeat to the Trucial Sheikhs Lord Curzon's assurance of 1903 quoted in Col. Loch^ telegram of 12th Sept. I gather that his point is that we had not in 1903 (and have not had since) a treaty with the Trucial Sheikhs which expressly guarantees them protection in so many words, and also that it requires consideration whether the policy of 1903 ought to be announced to the Arabs aa being still our policy to-day. The answer clearly is (as elaborated in the attached draft letter to Mr. Warner) that our policy, certainly no less now than in 1903, is one of ^ facto protection, and also that this is a reciprocal obligation on the British Govt, clearly implied by our agreements with the Sheikhs of 1892, by which they gave us control of their foreign relations. The position of facto protection is even clearer now than it was in 1903, in view of the growing importance of the Trucial Sheikhdoms, on account especially of the air route, v/hich has involved the establishment of a night stop and resthouse at Shargah. in/t (£) In case the F.Q. feel any serioas doubts about proposed announcement, hov/ever, I said that I would submit a proposal to send a ’suspending' telegram to Col. Loch. I hope, however, that the F.O. will agree to the proposed announcement, in which case we should send a further telegram telling Col. Loch to proceed as previously instructed. Mr. Warner also asked whether the durbar of Trucial Sheikhs would include the Sheikh of Qatr. Presumably this is not Col. Loch's intention, but we might make sure. v 4/u—►VW-V*-C' Department. SEP In view of oar telephone conversation this morning regarding Loch’s proposed announcement to the Trucial Sheikhs reaffirming Lord Curzon’s assurance of 1903, we are sending the suspending telegram of which copy is enclosed. We very much hope, however, that you will be prepared to agree to the reaffirmation of Curzon's assurance. Though we quite acknowledge that the prima facie doubts as to the appropriateness of its wording which you have pointed out deserve consideration, we suggest, m view of the following considerations, that there is no reason for whittling down the assurance regarding guardianship and protection which was then given to the Sheikhs. Apart from the maritime truce, there are the Exclusive Agreements of 1892, whereby the Trucial Sheikhs undertook that they would on no account enter into any agreements or correspondence with any Power other than the British Govt., etc. This exclusive control of the foreign relations of the Sheikhs seems to us necessarily to imply that we will protect them from aggressive acts by foreign Powers (since the agreement deprives/deprives them of the right of even diplomatic action to protect themselves). The Agreements imply this reciprocal obligation on the British Govt. We have always regarded these Sheikhdoms as facto under our protection, and have made no secret of this from the Persians (compare F.O. telegram 186 of 4th September, 1928, quoted in para. 22 on page 91 cf P.G. 13). The changes v/hich have taken place in the Persian Gulf in recent years will have the effect of making our ^e facto protection all the more important and all the more a reality,rather than the reverse. The dependence of the strategic and civil air routes on the Arab coast will, for example, inevitably have this effect, and incidentally will (as we have always recognised) make it more difficult for us to refrain even from interference in the internal affairs of the Sheikhdoms. Loch's proposal to hold a durbar is in itself an admirable plan, as it fits in well with the purpose of the visit of the flotilla to show the flag, and remind would be very unfortunate if Loch cannot even go so far as to reaffirm to the durbar/Department. durbar the assurances previously given them of adherence to our past policy. r&amp;M J.

Chiefs of the Arab Coast who are in Ireatv relaU fina with the_ British Covemment . - I have come here as the representative in the great Empire of India of the British authority which you and your fathers and fore-fathers have known and dealt with for more than a hundred years; and my object is to show you, that though you live at some distance from the shores of India, you are not forgotten by the Government, but that they adhere to the policy of guardian ship and protection which has given you peace and guaranteed your rights for the best part of a century; and that the first Viceroy of India who has ever visited these waters does not quit them without seeking the opportunity of meeting you in person and of renewing the assurances and engagements by which we have been so long united. Chiefs, your fathers and grandfathers before you have doubtless told you of the history of the past. You know that a hundred years ago there were constant trouble and fighting in the Gulf; almost every man was a marauder or a pirate; kidnapping and slave trading flourished; fighting and bloodshed went on without stint or respite; no ship could put out to sea without feat* of attack; the pearl fishery was a scene of annual conflict; and security of trade or peace there was none. Then it was that the British Government intervened and said that, in the interests of its own subjects and traders, and of its legitimate influence in the seas that wash the Indian coasts, this state of affairs must not continue. British flotillas appeared in these waters. British forces occupied the ports and towns on the coast that we see from this deck. The struggle was severe- 2 - while it lasted but it was not long sustained. In 1820 the first general Treaty was signed between the British G-overnment and the Chiefs; and of these or similar agreements there have been in all no fewer than eight. In 1839 the Maritime Truce was concluded, and was renewed from time to time until the year 1853, when it was succeeded by the Treaty of Perpetual Peace that has lasted ever since. Under that Treaty it was provided that there should be a complete cessation of hostilities at sea between the subjects of the signatory Chiefs, and a M perfect maritime truce” - to use the words that were employed - 'for evermore;' that in the event of aggressions on anyone by sea, the injured parties should not retaliate, but should refer the matter to the British Resident in the Persian Gulf, and that the British Government should watch over the peace of the Gulf and ensure, at all times, the observance of the Treaty. Chiefs, that Treaty has not, of course, prevented occasional trouble and conflict; it has sometimes been neglected or infringed; but on the whole it has well deserved its name; and under it has grown up a condition of affairs so peaceful and secure that the oldest among you can only remember as a dim story the events of the past, while the younger have never seen warfare or bloodshed on the seas. It is now eleven years since the last disturbance of the peace occurred. Chiefs, out of the relations that were thus created, and which by your own consent constituted the British Government the guardian of inter-tribal peace there grew up political ties between the Government of India and yourselves, whereby the British Government became your overlords and protectors, and you have relations with no other Power. Every one of the States known as the Trucial- 3 •» States has bound itself, as you know, not to enter into any agreement or correspondence with any other Power, not to admit the agent of any other Grovernment, and not to part with any portion of its territories. These engagements are binding on every one of you, and you have faithfully adhered to them. They are also binding in their reciprocal effect upon the British Government, and as long as they are faithfully observed by the Chiefs there is no fear that anyone else will be allowed to tamper with your rights or liberties. Sometimes I think that the record of the past is in danger of being forgotten, and there are persons who ask why should Grreat Britain continue to exercise these powers? The history of your States and of your families, and the present condition of the Gulf, are the answer. We were here before any other Power, in modern times, had shown its face in these waters. We found strife and we have created order. It was our commerce as well as your security that was threatened and called for protection. At every port along these coasts the subjects of the King of England still reside and trade. The great Empire of India, which it is our duty to defend, lies almost at your gates. We saved you from extinction at the hands of your neighbours. We opened these seas to the ships of all nations, and enabled their flags to fly in peace. We have not seized or held your territory. We have not destroyed your independence but have preserved it. We are not now going to throw away this century of costly and triumphant enterprise; we shall not wipe out the most unselfish page in history. The peace of these waters must still be maintained; your independence will continue to be upheld; and the influence of the British Government must remain supreme. There is one respect in which the Chiefs themselves can- 4 - avert any renewal of trouble in the future. The British Government have no desire to interfere, ana have never interfered,in your internal affairs, provided that the Chiefs govern their territories with justice, and respect the rights of the foreign traders residing therein. If any internal disputes occur, you will always find a friend in the British Resident, who will use his influence, as he has frequently done in the past, to prevent these dissensions from coming to a head, and to maintain the status quo : for we could not approve of one independent Chief attacking another Chief by land, simply because he was not permitted to do it by sea, and thus evading the spirit of his Treaty obligations. I will mention a case that seems to lend itself to friendly settlement of the character that I have described. You are all of you aware that the strip of coast known as the Batineh Coast, on the opposite side of the Oman Peninsula, is under the authority of the Chief of the Jowasmis. Nevertheless his authority is contested in some quarters. It is desirable that these disputes should cease, and that the peace should remain undisturbed. Chiefs, these are the relations that subsist between the British Government and yourselves. The Sovereign of the British liimpire lives so far away that none of you has ever seen or will ever see his face; but his orders are carried out everywhere throughout his vast dominions by the officers of his Government, and it is as his representative in India who is responsible to him for your welfare that I am here to-day to exchange greetings f' with you, to renew old assurances, and to wish you prosperity in the future.INDIA OFFICE titCO IS MICliOriLM</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000154_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/3773</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000154</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/3773</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 30/56 'Persian Gulf.
