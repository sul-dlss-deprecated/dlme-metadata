Two additional foliation sequences are also present in parallel between ff 2-207, and ff 15-207; these numbers are also written in pencil, but are not circled. A previous foliation sequence, which is also circled, has been superseded and therefore crossed out.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>This file contains documents and correspondence relating to the takeover of Iraq by British forces following the coup d'état in Iraq during 1941. The papers discuss the possibility of an Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, and the domestic political situation in Iraq during and immediately after both the coup and the start of the British invasion. This includes ascertaining the political attitudes of notables, influential tribes, and military forces present in Iraq at the time. A variety of documents in the latter half of the file pertain to the British effort at stabilising the Iraqi Government following the British takeover, including discussions of its international alliances and treaty obligations.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Coup d'états</topic></subject><subject><geographic>Iraq</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Anglo-Iraqi War (1941)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Military intelligence</topic></subject><subject><topic>Second World War (1939-1945)</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000097#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000097#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
