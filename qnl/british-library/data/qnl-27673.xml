Considering the record of previous death of the Sultan of Oman and as a precaution, Saiyid Taimur was askod to come and see me this morning. I offered to help him in the event of the Sultan f s illness becoming worse suddenly or of his dying unexpectedly by cp Ctvwo getting in troopd from Bait al Falaj ^increasing the guard of the Agency to 100 men and a British officer to keep the town in order.

With reference to the diary entry 394, Saiyids Taimur and Dhiyab returned in the “ Nur-ul-Bahr ” after sending Shaikh Kashid-bin-Uziyiz, with 40 men to Nakhl as a reinforcement. 409. The Bani Harras who constitute the garrison in the fort of Nakhl are said to have objected to this addition on the ground that it would provoke an attack by the rebels who had not till then made an appearance at Nakhl. 410. Jamadar Abdullah-bin-Isa, lately in charge of the fort of Samail, has been stationed in the fort of Barkah with 30 men. 411. It is reported that Shaikh Hamdan-bin-Sulaiman, uncle of Shaikh Hamyar-bin-Nasir-bin-Sulaiman, visited Wadi Samail where people welcomed him out of fear rather than affection or regard. 412. A band of 20, and according to another report 50, men of the Siyabi tribe raided Al-Mogabra near Watiyah and drove off 4 camels belonging to His Highness the Sultan. The keepers and others of His Highness’s men offered no resistance and made a belated report to the troops at Bait-al-Ealaj. 413. It is reported from Samail that an Arab woman, who was accused of adultery and confessed, was stoned to death by order of the Imam, who is said to have thrown the first stone at her. ***•••* Foreign interests .— 415. An elderly Arab, a native of Sur, named Muhammad-bin-Salim- bin-Nagim, met the acting Head Clerk on the 26th September. He said that for 16 years he had been Officiating Kazi in the German East African port of Mikindani and is now on leave. He further said that he came here in the company of Abdur Rahman, younger brother of Abdul Aziz Ar-Ruwaihi of the Erench Consulate, about two months ago. He went on to Sur immediately and Abdur Rahman left the Wadi Ma’awal. This Abdur Rahman is a notorious partisan of the rebels, and it is stated that he has lately persuaded Abdul Aziz to lend the Imam a sum of $ 4,000. Abdul Rahman is supposed to be returning to Zanzibar, where he is employed, shortly and the object of Muhammad-bin-Salim’s visit to Maskat was to get into communi cation with Abdur Rahman and arrange for their return to Africa. 416. Muhammad-bin-Salim was inquisitive, asked what was the British attitude towards the Maskat State and whether His Highness the Sultan, in his relations with the British Government, occupies the same position as the Rao of Cutch or enjoys greater freedom. He also wanted to know whether the British Government take action against the rebels or leave matters as they are at present. The Acting Head Clerk replied that clerks knew nothing of these matters. Muhammad-bin-Salim had intended to travel in India but, on account of ill-health, has decided to return to Africa as soon as possible.[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Poyfimmont. ] ASIATIC TURKEY AND ARABIA.

WITH reference to your letter dated the 10th instant regarding the tribal rising against the Sultan of Muscat, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to forward, for the information of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, copy of further telegrams that have been received from the Government of India on the subject. The Marquess of Crewe thinks it probable that action such as that recommended by Sir P. Cox and Major Knox might be effective, and he does not underrate the force of the considerations urged by them. But, having regard to all the circumstances, he is definitely of opinion that the obligations of His Majesty’s Government towards the Sultan are sufficiently discharged by the aid they are affording in the defence of Muscat and Muttra, and consequently he agrees with the Government of India that the accepted policy of non-intervention in the hinterland should be adhered to.

Warning letters have been delivered in pursuance of your telegraphic instructions of the 10th instant. Messenger was sent back without receiving a reply. We repeat following telegrams, and will communicate our own views subsequently :— (i) From Political Agent, Muscat, dated the 11th July, with reference to telegram No. 232 S., Secret, from Foreign Department:— “ From all present indications an immediate attack on Muscat and Muttra is not likely, but I agree with suggestion of the officer commanding troops that regiment should be held in readiness. Tranquillising effect which I anticipated appears to have been obtained at once by landing of troops. I am now arranging with Sultan for despatch in his steamer (under convoy of H.M.S. ‘Philomel’) of his son Hamid with his Suri troops, including strong contingent of Bani-bu-Ali. I propose myself to watch developments from on board ‘Philomel,’ and, subject to approval, to make effort to communicate with rebel leaders and discover what possible lines of arrangement with them on His Highness’s behalf are open. I should be accompanied by Sheikh Rashid’s secretary, who would probably be sent to Isa-bin-Saleh under flag of truce to enquire latter’s intentions and what chances there are of understanding being reached. I would consult both His Highness and Government fully before committing either. It appears probable that the rebellion is collapsing, and that interview will be refused by the chiefs; in that case I shall ask opinion of Hamid and the secretary as to advisability of the Bani-bu-Ali advancing on Bidbid at once. Isa has apparently only 140 men thereabouts, and the Sultan’s fort seems to be maintaining resistance/ The immediate object to be gained by such advance is to relieve Seyyid Nadir. He wrote a cheerful letter to his father as recently as the 9th instant to say that he had inflicted heavy losses on besieging force and was holding out well. I should be accompanied to Sib by Murphy ; we should sleep on board ‘Philomel’ and not go further than Sib without permission, and I should be in touch with Muscat within three hours by wireless the whole time.” [2985 z—1]From Political Agent, Muscat, dated the 13th July, in continuation of above “ Yesterday morning I had long interview with Sheikh Rashid, Seyyid Mahommed, and His Highness. The Bani-bu-Ali are reluctant to_ move. It may be possible to persuade them to advance to Sib, but unless, as is improbable, situation turns out very favourable they will get no further than that. Utmost limit of enduiance ot Samail Bidbid is estimated at a month. If it falls, it is unanimous conviction of three persons mentioned that a formidable rising will have to be faced. Muscat and Muttra are perfectly safe for present, and the three state that a final suppression of the rising would be achieved by advance on Samail Bidbid of a determined force. Sultan unfortunately has no reliable force apparently, but he says that by landing at Sib a British force prepared to move on Samail Bidbid if found necessary, way would be opened for himself and supporters to occupy latter place. The confederacy would then, he says, collapse and the Ghafiris would renew their allegiance to him. “ I fully recognise the many objections to which such strong action is open, but in my opinion only alternatives are to take this course or to occupy Muscat and Muttra indefinitely. I therefore submit the proposal as in the long run economical of time and money, and as the only one by which restoration of previous position is possible. “Of course the Sultan will be required to make request in writing, force required for advance on Samail Bidbid is estimated as a battalion of native infantry and two sections of mountain battery, in addition to native troops already at hand.” (3.) From Political Agent, Muscat, dated the 13th July :— “ I was told definitely by Sultan this afternoon that the Bani-bu-Ali refuse to move. His Highness is completely disillusioned as to his Muscat Arabs and passed some scathing comments on them. “ From a reliable source the following casual remark made by French to American consul has reached me : ‘ If the British are only wise enough to take it, they have now got the chance of a lifetime.’ I think that, as emanating from a spectator of events whose acquaintance with Oman is intimate and whose experience of Arabs is practically a lifelong one, this remark is significant. I must leave it to decision of Government whether my previous telegram (No. 2) contains correct interpretation of chance alluded to. Please see in this connection the letter of Saud-ul-Jabri forwarded by this mail.” ( 4 -) From Resident in Persian Gulf, dated the 12th instant, with reference to No. 1, above (addressed to Foreign, repeated to Muscat) : — “As to first point—keeping a regiment in readiness—I agree that this is prudent. As regards ^second point—communications of political agent with leaders of rebels— J think, subject to further remarks from Knox, that he had better at first do no more than repeat the warning of 1895, pointing out that if they molest persons or property of British subjects they will have to deal with us. He had better leave to His Highness’s emissary any question of ‘arriving at any arrangement,’ especially if by that is meant buying them off. He might advise the emissary as opportunity arises, and be witness to any eventual agreement, if necessary. I recommend the remainder of Knox’s suggestions.” ( 5 .) From Resident, dated the 13th (addressed as No. 4), with reference to No. 2 :— “As contributory, if not the only cause of this rising, is Sultan’s co-operation in our suppression of arms traffic, we must in honour support him and his son firmly. “ With suggestion of political agent that by rigorous action now we shall probably be saved much trouble and expense in near future, I agree. There ought to be no3 great difficulty in getting tlie French to appreciate fact that Sultan’s position is undoubtedly really critical and to concur at same time in action we take. “ There are plenty of shady gardens at Sib, and it is eminently suitable as a base. IE a small force is landed there, prepared in last event to advance to Samail, there is every reason to believe that advance will not be found to be necessarv. “If u r e are required merely to keep the Sultan’s line of communication to the sea open, the force mentioned by political agent would suffice; but I think that tvro regiments on field service strength—one to advance with the two sections of mountain battery, one to hold line of communications—should be sent if we are required to advance ourselves on Samail.’’ Enclosure 2 in Xo. 1. Government of India to the Marquess of Crewe. (Telegraphic.) P. Jidy 22. 1913. PLEASE see my telegram dated Kith July: Situation at Muscat. On 19th it was reported that Seyyid Nadir, the Sultan’s son, whom the rebels are besieging at Samail, was in a critical position, and the Resident accordingly recommends that a force to march to relief of Samail should be landed at Sib, as he believes that as soon as they heard of the force being landed the rebels would disperse, and that in any case they would be prevented from taking further measures if Samail, which in Resident’s opinion must be held for sake of security of Muscat and its commercial existence, were relieved. Since then Major Knox has sent following telegrams :— a-) “The Sultan is making arrangements for despatch to Wadi Aththabaun of an advance party of Mozaffar’s men. There the Bani-jabar will join them, and, after the main body of Mozaffar’s men and others have reinforced them, Isa-bin-Saleh’s position before Bid will cease to be tenable. His Highness is led by reports from Samail valley to hope to be able to settle affairs by himself, and asked to postpone decision whether more help was required for three days. I pointed out that, whether he wanted more troops or not, it was not by any means certain that they would be sent, and that all I could tell him was that their despatch was under consideration. He appeared to be content and full of confidence, declaring that unless he asked within three days for help he would not ask at all. He appears to feel confident, though I myself am doubtful, that the situation has improved.” ( 2 .) “ All quiet at Muscat. Seyyid Taimur yesterday afternoon took all the Bani-bu-Ali to Sib; we passed them about an hour out from the town. The ‘Noor-al-bahar’ arrived last night with a further body — 230 in number—of Bani-umar and Nain-ed-dowlehi. She Avas at once ordered to return to Sib. A messenger has brought in a verbal report that sixty Bani-yas horsemen from the Trucial coast have come in to Sib, and that, not counting possible adherents in Samail valley, the force now collected under the Sultan and Taimur amounts to 1,000 as estimated.” Expedition to Sib and Samail cannot, we think, be considered. If the Samail garrison is in critical position, relieving force would not arrive in time, and, if it did, as soon as the expedition evacuated the position and retired, the rebels would occupy it. It is not desirable for us to interfere actively in the internal politics of Muscat. In our opinion we should not do more that make Muscat and Muttra secure, and any additional places on the coast which the naval squadron can protect. The Sultan must look after his own affairs in the interior; we cannot shoulder responsibility for keeping his sons there safe. He is given a secure base for action b} r our protection of his capital, and he is thereby enabled to denude it of troops for operations in other directions.[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty's Government.] ASIATIC TURKEY AND ARABIA.

Crisis at Muscat. # On the 1st August Major Knox reported prevalence of rumours that Samail is hard pressed and that Bidbid has been taken. We repeat, for your Lordship’s informa tion, following further telegrams from him, and will communicate our views thereon later. The telegrams are ail dated the 1st August:— 1. “ Officer in command of troops has just telegraphed that friendlies passing through picket No. 3 report Imam’s army to be now on the advance, that one pait of it is about four hours’ march from Sib, at Khoz, and the remainder on the road to Muscat, at Musfaha, a day’s march from Muscat, which the party at Musfaha say they are going on to attack.” . , . , , ^ , p q m • 2 “Sultan to-day sent me a letter, m which he says that capture^of Samail is imminent, and briefly recapitulates how this will endanger his rule and British trade. He declares that the arms warehouse and the rules which on Governments ad\ice he made for it, are cause of his present difficulties. To prove this he adduces the Imam s recent proclamation publishing conditions of his refraining from attacking Muttra and Muscat town; first of these is that the agreement respecting arms compacted by the Sultan with the Christians be torn to shreds. This proclamation I have seen and think genuine. © His Hi Mi ness’s letter goes on to say that it has been represented by interested parties falsely 5 , that the warehouse arrangement is a British-Muscat plan for enslaving tribes by preventing them getting possession of modern rifles and cartridges. He therefore appeals to Government with confidence for help and their old and sincere friendship in his time of need; he asks that troops may be sent by Government as it thinks best, either to relieve or, if necessary, to retake Samail. Hus he considers would effect suppression of the rebellion, and would restore the country and its trade to quiet. He undertakes to keep this appeal secret until Government replies to it. He is fully aware that it is uncertain what that reply will be. _ “ The Sultan’s message I forward at once, not to lose time, and will submit comments on it and suggestions later.” .. . ,. x , ,, 3 “ Your telegram of the 19th ultimo. I beg that policy indicated therein may be pursued. Although recent events must have strained the Sultan’s loyalty to [1825 m —3] /breaking point, he has adhered most faithfully to his promises to us. To prophesy after the event is easy; but we might have foretold this rebellion as inevitable result of the warehouse arrangement, which probably is the first serious effort, since His Highness came to the throne, to force the tribes to accept a policy which must be unwelcome to them. The obvious course for the Sultan to take, if he gives up hope of our helping him, is to abandon the warehouse scheme. This, I submit with deference, would increase enormously the diplomatic difficulties in suppressing the aims traffic. But if we steadily support His Highness and the warehouse now, as soon as present disturbance is past we should have a friend strong and devoted to us, and politics of Muscat would enter upon a new era of peace and progress. “If it is true that Imam's force is advancing, it would be well if the transports called at Muscat to find out wdiether troops should be pushed on from there; this will be settled by events of next two days.” The Resident, Persian Gulf, comments as follows, on last two of Knox’s telegrams above :— “ I fully and earnestly support Knox’s remarks, and have already stated my opinion, that we are bound in honour to help His Highness. Government can, I know, see further ahead than we on the spot, but I cannot see that the evil will result if we do not respond to His Highness’s appeal, can be other than irremediable. This I say the more earnestly that I know that our failure in 1895 to give adequate assistance was main cause of his unsatisfactory attitude towards us between 1896 and 1899.” Enclosure 2 in No. J.

You are, I presume, satisfied as to sufficiency of native troops to defeat the rebels, in event of their attacking Muscat and Muttra in a crushing manner. If you are not their reinforcement seems desirable. It is essential in my opinion that help we afford should be really effective, though limited to coastal operations. Enclosure 3 in No. 1.

Please see our recent telegraphic repetitions of Resident’s reports, and also your Lordship’s telegram of the 5th instant. Dangers which Resident and Political Agent point out, that Sultan may throw over arms w r arehouse and resume the attitude of hostility and obstruction which he took up in past, that we may be involved in indefinitely protracted defence of his capital and Muttra, and that other Arab chiefs on coast of Gulf may be alarmed lest consequences like those arisen in Muscat would follow from their co-operation in suppressing arms traffic, and may, therefore, refuse to help, are fully realised by us. We do not overlook either, that these dangers would largely be avoided, and practical demonstration of our peculiar position in Muscat as compared with that of other nations would be afforded by giving Sultan the help which he requires, which, moreover, is morally incumbent on us, for his protection from the ill results of helpful attitude he has shown to us. In spite of this we remain convinced that to intervene in the interior involves risks greater than compensating advantages, and that no more than coastal operations should be undertaken. These should be as effective as possible in the circumstances. Military authorities state that the troops now at Muscat and Muttra are strong enough to beat off any serious attack, but if they are to combine this with infliction of heavy loss on rebels, reinforcement by a native infantry battalion is necessary, and field-guns should be landed from war-ships to help. We agree with military authorities, and if your Lordship approves, propose to despatch a battalion to Muscat without delay.No. 3113, dated Bushire, the 12th (received 20tli) October 1913 (Confidential).

Extract from MasJcat News for the week ending the 4th October 1913. Condition of the country .— 424. Letters received during the week by His Highness the Sultan from the interior indicate that the rebellion is weakening. Shaikh flamyar-bin- Nasir is said to be lukewarm, finding that supporting a rebel army is expen sive. There is also a general feeling among the people that they are more heavily taxed under the new regime and the rebel leaders cannot agree. 425. The Wall of Sur reports that the rebels are planning an advance on that port under Shaikh Isa-bin*Salih Al-Harithi. The Wali of Sur seems alarmed and is strengthening the fort of Sur and the neighbouring towers and asking for fresh supplies of ammunition from Maskat. 426. It is further reported by the Wali of Sur that the Shaikhs of Sharqiyah are now inclining towards the Imam for whom they are trying to raise funds by disposing of Waqf properties at Bidiyah and elsewhere. It seems probable, however, that these reports are due to a desire to obtain more ammunition from the Sultan. 427. The Jannabah Shaikhs of Sur have written to His Highness assuring him of their loyal support and defence of Sur in case the rebels attack 433. On the 1st, His Highness the Sultan’s yacht “ Nur-ul-Bahr ” left for Hil, Khabura, with forty men of the Bani Umar and arrived on the 2nd. 437. The health of His Highness the Sultan has given cause for the gravest anxiety. During the week, his illness has rapidly gained upon him and he became unconscious on Friday evening. On Saturday morning, a woman of the household, entering his bedchamber, gave a false report to the harem that His Highness was dead and the usual lamentations, customary in this country on the news of death, broke forth and lasted sufficiently long for the shops to be closed and all work in town and harbour to cease before the alarm could be contradicted. His Highness remained unconscious ail Saturday and the end may be expected any moment.

This conversation took place at the house of Syud Taimur on the 10th : of October between 12 and 1p.m. . I was in the verandah and they were having a conversation in the inner room. I did not hea,: what they were saying but Syud Taimur called me in and asked me to deliver the cases . I expalned to Syud Taimur that tne rules do not permit me to do this , unles the consignee produces a delivery order which All Moosa had not done .

I did not mention the conversation of the day before with Syud Timur or make any suggestion that I was likely to be exposed to an insistent demand to hand the goods over with out the production o’ a delivery order .

During late Sultan^ life time we practically treated Taimur as heir apparent. I arrived Masqat 6th Instant and paid informal visit of condolence to Al Bu Saiyid family same day. All Saiyid Faisal’s sons were present and also sons of Muhammad bin Turk! but latter did not attend himself. On 8th instant Al Bu Saiyid family returned my visit at which Viceroy’s message of condolence was officially communicated to them. On this occasion neither Muhammad bin Turki nor his sons were present. Taimur’s brothers then informed Political Agent and myself in Taimur*s presence that they concurred in Taimur*s accession and would render him all loyalty and support. On 9th instant Taimur installed himself at formal assembly of leading inhabitants and retainers and afterwards addressed identic letter to Foreign representatives inti mating that in accordance witli his father’s directions he had taken over the reins of government and requested that they would inform their Governments accordingly. At our meeting on 8th I had informed him that I con sidered that he should address a supplementary communication to British Agency saying that he realised that he could not hold his own without our material and moral support and begging Political Agent to assure Government that he accepted all the obligations which his father bore towards the British Government and intended to pursue his father’s policy, in regard to the arms traffic as well as other matters, and undertook to be guided by our advice in all important questionsll © questionc (of course without prejudice to his independence). Then in conclusion he was to say that he hoped that Govern ment would strengthen his hands for the difficult task be fore him by according him official recognition as speedily as practicable. The natural corollary of such recognition being in our case the continuance of the subsidies paid to hie father. Seeing that the greater part of Oman is dis affected and that the rebels claim to have deposed the late Sultan and started a new dynasty in the person of the Imam pretender, it would be obviously bootless to consult the tribes in this case, and therefore provided that he wrote a letter on the above lines, as he said he was ready to do, we intended to recommend that, unless any important change of policy was contemplated in connection with Saiyid Faisal l s death. Government should authorise us by telegraph to inti mate their recognition and to continue payment of subsidy as usual, without requiring any further conditions than the general undertakings above mentioned. Having been badly ad vised I think, by his relatives Taimur at first sent a letter in unsuitable terms which I refused to accept and from 9th to 12th the wording was patiently discussed and only one point remained for adjustment when the incident occurred described in my immediately following telegram. Letter has since been given in suitable terms. Cox&lt; Telegram From - Resident, Bushire, (Masqat). To - Foreign, Simla. No. M-13. Dated 13th October 1913. % Masqat Arms Warehouse. Please see Masqat letter to Foreign ^0.216 of 16th December 1912. From Second sub enclosure it will be noted that Sultan authorised All Musa to import 6 lakhs of cartridges. Of these 5 lakhs were for Sultan and 1 lakh for Ali Musa himself for sale through Warehouse to approved buyers. Consignment was ordered firms wholly or partly from French/and arrived in instalments about March 1913. Sultan took delivery of his own lot, but authorised retention of Ali Musa's consignment in Ware house pending production of Bill of Lading according to regulations. Shipping documents had been sent to Bank a£ in Bombay only to be delivered against payment of account due by Ali Musa. Latter however had procrastinated in redeeming Bill of Lading and meanwhile had several times endeavoured to obtain possession of the cartridges with out it, but Sultan and Saiyid Qasim were firm and cartridges remained in Warehouse up to Saiyid Faisal's death. Yesterday morning Political Agent was passing office of Warehouse Superintendent when latter asked him to step in and then informed him that during previous day Taimur * had given him peremptory orders to deliver 70,000 of Ali Musa's Cartridges without production of Bin of Lading, and that after making all protest that he could he was ob liged to obey. As I was expecting a visit from Saiyid Tai mur in half an hour on other business Knox hurried on to warn me without waiting to hear further details of trans action. On Taimur's arrival he was at once taxed with this flagrant dereliction. He was reminded that French mer chants had a claim on ammunition from which law suit might(£) result and he was informed that if the matter was to be settled locally the cartridges must be immediately re placed in Warehouse. He begged to be allowed to substi tute other cartridges on the ground that it would be dif- t ficult and humiliating for him to put these cases back, but he was informed definitively that nothing but res toration of identical goods would suffice. He departed promising to replace them but unfortu nately it was ascertained that cartridges had already left for Su/v- in a dhow of the Bani bu Ali tribe for one of whose leading Shaikhs they were infienJed. As the dhow had a fair wind it was doubtful if she could be overtaken but the Nur-ul-Bahr went out ta at once with a responsi ble representative from Saiyid Taimur and I am glad to say that the cases have been recovered intact and replaced in the warehouse. I shall suggest notice to be taken in a separate telegram. Cox.Telegram P. From - Resident, Masqat. To - Foreign, Simla No. M-14 Dated 13th October 1913. With reference to telegrams Nos. M 12 and 13 Yesterday evening I received a call from Saiyid Taimur who was most penitent and apologised for his conduct. He said that, although Saiyid Qasim had done all that was in his power to deter him, the full and grave portent of his action was not at the time clear to him. He went on to say that his lesson had been sharp and humiliating and gave his solemn assurance that it should act as a warning for him for the future; that his obligations should be Hbixgad observed undeviatingly; and that lie would never again ta-ue action in matters such as these without consultation with the Political Agent. He tooH upon himself the entire blame for the impossible position in which he had placed Saiyid Qasim, and begged that his own conduct might not be visited on the latter. It appears that he really repents of his action and as it would be inconvenient to have any upheaval in regard to the succession at this juncture, we trust that it may please Government to condone the dereliction/ far as it concerns Taimur and vasim. At the same time it is recommendedjthat the opportunity should be taken for demanding that Ali Musa should be deported immediately, and that, as secut’ity that his obligations will be met, his property in Masqat shou^ g^ttach^ d. jgath wo awd t ttfiu source of trouble both direct and indirect^ - and'a most salutary effect would be produced by his removal at the present time. as CoxTelegram.

Some people expressed view that Faisal’s death might create a detente and give revolt an opening for reconciliation with new ruler. Saiyid Taimur himself ex*- pressed this view. He begged that at any rate he be given time to try his luck and meanwhile requested that consider-r ation of the suggestion for the sealing of Masqat and Batinah ports against rebels might be deferred as calculated to clash with his pacific endeavours. During the week since passed letters have been going and coming. The last one received by Taimur from the rebel leaders was in truculent terms and concluded with the statement that they were now about to advance on Masqat. Today one of the A1 Bu Saiyid family living near Saraail writes to say that the Imam has just left Saraail for ZiKiii and has circularised tho Shaikh of various rebel contingents calling upon them to assemble after the I^-ul-Haj, four weeKs hence, for the advance on Masqat.

After compliments .—We inform your honour that the people of Oman have agreed by common consent to depose their Sultan, and have assembled to rise against him disliking the innovations he has brought about in Islam, by contravening the Shara commands and committing what is forbidden therein and setting the people against one another, and thereby disturbances are rife in the country and the order of things is disturbed, crimes have been ^ committed, blood has been shed, property looted, legal punishments dispensed with and rights destroyed. Thereupon, the Muslims felt shame for the sake of their religion and were angered on account of what they saw of corruption. So they assembled and agreed on this happy rising-up and hope thereby to secure the reform of their country and people. And as this movement has culminated up to Wadi Samail, we understand that your honour have landed a party of your troops at Bait-al-Palaj and its vicinity. We considered this matter and feared lest there should be a collision between us and you. We pondered over our situation and forbade the tribes to attack, and ordered them to protect your subjects. They obeyed as they needs must obey. All this was done out of regard for your Government and a solicitude to maintain our mutual friendship. By God ! we have not delayed (an attack) on any account except this. Further, we understand that letters have been forged as from us which would cause hatred and ill-will, but an2 untruth like that cannot he concealed from the like of your honour. And it is hoped from your honour that the troops will be removed from Maskat and its neighbourhood, and, God willing, you will have faithfulness (on our part) in relation to your rights, and protection for your subjects’ lives and property, and insha-Allah, you will find perfect faithfullness. And a reply is requested as soon as may be. This is written by their order by Muhammad-bin-Abdullah As*Salimi, with bis band.

After compliments .—It is stated to your honour that you may be acquaint ed with, and informed of, the fact that the entire Arab community of Oman, from Katar to Maskat, has agreed upon setting aside its former Sultan, Taisal- bin-Turki, and has installed a new Sultan for itself, and has secured from him bonds and pledges for the welfare of the country, peace for the people, and compliance with the Bright Code as enforced by the Unitarian Islamic teach ings. And as regards yourself, it is requested of your Government to desist from interfering in this important affair and to stick to the zone of separation in accordance wdth the known Law r in relation to independent States and their autocratic Sultans, as France has done with us. And you will have loyalty on our part in the requirements of friendship and bonds of amity. And we think it impossible that the Great British Government should interpose between us and the reform of our country and be the sole cause leading to ruin and destruc tion and of creating ill-will against herself, for she is a wise Government and the only one which has always been trying to uphold the rights of mankind. And your Government should not suppose that the people of Oman are stupid and ignorant Bedouins knowing no law and understanding nothing. They are, on tie other hand, an intelligent people who have gained experience of the world in every side, have tasted its sw r eets and hitters, known the causes of progress and civilization and understood the policies of powers as well as their tactics. And your Government should not think that this our rising is one for looting, extortion and murder, God fordid that it should be so ! On the other hand, it is a rising the object of winch is peace for the country and happi ness for the people. It is, therefore, requested and hoped of your Govern ment that her troops will he moved from Bait-al-Falaj and entirely removed early. If these were brought for the protection of your subjects, then w r e undertake the responsibility of protecting their lives and property. God willing ! And we do not think that your Government, which is v r ell-known for her diplomacy and considerate treatment, will prefer one individual to twm millions of Arabs and will dash their freindship and love which is greater for her than for any other Government against the wall as useless. The Arab community thinks her above that and that she is far too noble to suffer such a thing from which your Government will reap nothing but loss of lives and the flowing of gutters of blood on the surface of the earth. And a reply is requested from you immediately. This is from the representative of all, Abdullah-bin-Hamaid As-Salimi. Written by his son Muhammad with his hand.

After compliments —I have received your two friendly letters on the subject of the peoples of Oman and they will in due course be submitted to %3 my Government and will no doubt receive their wise consideration. By this time, however, you have no doubt heard of the death of our friend, Saiyid Baisal-hin-Turki, who has now appeared before a Higher Judge than your selves and us and all it would ill be seem any of us to presume to pronounce an opinion on the merits or demerits of his past life. You say with truth that the Great British Government loves justice and peace, and you may he sure that the great desire of that Government is that there should he concord and a good understanding between the Kulers and the subjects of Oman. It has been a source of gratification to me to note from friendly com munications which our friend Saiyid Taimur has shown me that the pillar of the Abadhi religion, Shaikh Abdulla-bin-Hamaid As-Salimi, has not ceased to offer him counsels of wisdom and humanity, and this encourages me in the hope that the clouds which have unfortunately arisen between the people and the ruler in the latter days of Saiyid Faisal-bin-Turki may be dispelled and the tribes may at no distant date reach a good understanding with his successor. - v {Sub-Enclosure No. 4.)

And you are aware that the community has deposed him a long time before his death aud rose against him on various occasions the last being this present rising which we hope will be auspicious, and we pray to God that He may complete his blessing on us and consummate His light for us. And we have previously sent you letters, dated the 30th Shawwal, as we had not seen the new moon which we realized afterwards thus the date should be 1st Al-Qa’ada. The subject matter of those letters being that we have not arisen but to protest against the innovation brought about by the despotic Sultan in the shedding of blood and setting the tribes one against the other, the disregard of privileges and omission of prescribed penalties and the weakening of the Shara’ commands, and thereby disturbances arose among the people. There upon the nation felt ashamed for the sake of its religion and angered on account of bloodshed and (loss of) property. So, it assembled in this auspicious assemblage the news of which has reached you. Then we heard that you landed a party of your troops at Bait-al-Ealaj, but we disliked to attack fearing lest there should be a collision between us whereby the means of friendship would be ended. So we wrote to you about this, but have not received a reply, and God knows if the letters reached you. If you have landed that party for the protection of your subjects, we have undertaken the responsibility of protecting them, and it will be our duty, God willing, to protect the subjects and their property, be they of any nationality whatever. And you have known that we have not come forward to create disturbance on the earth, so when this our letter reaches you, remove your troops, as we are, God willing, coming on the track of the letter in order to take what there is there of the Arab kingdom. And we are responsible for the protection of your interests as well as those of others. And reply is requested by hand of the messenger who bears this.

The Imam and Shaikh Abdullah-bin-Hamaid As-Salimi have written to Saiyid Tairaur exhorting him to abide by and enforce the Shara orders and to administer justice in the country. These would appear to point to a weakening of the spirit of rebellion and a desire for reconciliation. 439. The Political Agent also received communications from the above persons asking that they may be let alone by Government to settle their dis putes with their ruler and that the troops may be recalled, as they, the leaders, undertake the responsibility of protecting British and other foreign subjects and their properties. 440. News has been received from Sohar that one of the Maghrabi Askaris formihg the garrison there, whose pay was partly withheld, shot the Akid killing him immediately. A relation of the Akid who was there shot the murderer dead at the same time. 441.

The funeral of the late Sultan, Sir Saiyid Faisal-bin-Turki, G.C.I.E., took place on the 6th instant. The Janazah was borne from the palace at 8 a.m., and the funeral was attended by a very large number of the inhabitants as well as British Indians and other foreigners. Of the Government and others the following were present:—The Political Agent with his staff, Colonel Edwardes, Commanding 102nd Grenadiers, accompanied by Lieutenant Christie, Adjutant, Colonel Smith, Commanding 2nd Rajputs, accompanied by Captain Griffiths, Adjutant, the Agency Surgeon, Clerk in Charge Telegraphs and Jemadar of the Maskat escort. The French Consul and the American Vice and Deputy Consuls were also present. 450. On the 6th, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, accompanied by the Political Agent, paid a visit of condolence to the sons and other members of the family of the late Sultan. Only Saiyid Muhammad-bin-Turki, half- brother of the late Sir Saiyid Eaisal-bin-Turki, was absent from this and other functions after the burial. 451. On the 8th October 1913, at 11 a.m., after the three days of mourn ing for the late Sir Saiyid Faisal-bin-Turki were concluded, Saiyid Taimur-bin- Faisal, accompanied by his brothers Saiyids Nadir, Muhammad, Hamad and Hamud and his cousin Saiyid Dhiyab-bin-Fahad and his first cousin once re moved, Ali-bin-Salim*bin-Dhuwaini, paid a visit to the Political Resident at the Agency. The following officials and notables of the Oman Government were also in attendance:—Saiyid Hamud-bin-Azzan-bin-Qais Mutawwa’, Saiyid Muhammad*bin-Hamad, Wali of Matrah, Saiyid Saif-bin-Badar, Saiyid2 Harmid-bin-Hamad Rai Dhabiya, Saiyid Yusuf Az-Zawawi. A message of condolence from ITis Excellency the Viceroy to the family of the late Sultan was conveyed by the Political Resident to Saiyid Taimur and his brothers. A verbal message was sent later to Saiyid Muhammad-bin-Turki informing him that he had been included in the above message of condolence and that the Resident regretted that neither Saiyid Muhammad himself nor any of his children was present to hear it. The Resident was assured by those of the family present that they were ready to acknowledge Saiyid Taimur as their Sultan and head and that they were ready to give him full and loyal support. 452. On the 8th October 1913, Saiyid Taimur held a durbar which was attended by the local notables at which he announced his accession. No Foreign Government was there represented. The accession seems to be accepted by all present at Maskat without opposition of any kind except from ^ His late Highness’s brother, but it seems not unlikely that he too will shortly submit to the inevitable. It is rumoured that the principal objection now remaining is the increase of the allowances he received from his late brother from $ 1,000 to $ 2,000 per month. Saiyid Taimur appears to think that $ 1,500 should suffice, but will probably accept his uncle’s figure in return for full support. 453. Saiyid Taimur appears to have grasped the reins of Government firmly and to be inclined to work through his brothers, Saiyid Nadir and Muhammad and his cousin Dhiyab-bin-Fahad-bin-Turki. Great reforms are promised, especially in the Customs; public smoking and drinking are to be prohibited and prostitutes are to leave the town, the local authorities at Matrah have received -warnings, against the taking of bribes and justice has been promised to high and low. Most of these reforms are in deference to the presumed wishes of the Shaikh Abdullah-bin-Hamaid As-Salimi, one of the moving spirits of the rebellion.TiiLEGHAM.R. B'rom Residetit, To Masqat. No 1784.

He is receiving communications, in reply, generally containing expressions of sympathy and assurances of loyalty from most of the Chiefs, notably Shaikh Isa-bin-Salih Al-Harithi, Hamad-bin-Hilal-bin-Hamad of the Ya’l-Saa’d, Saif-bin-Hilal, Hamad-bin-Ali, Muhammad-bin-Saif and Abdullah- bin-Said-bin-Khalfan of Wadi Samail; Hamad-bin-Said-bin-Hammad of the Bani Rawaha, Hamad-bin-Aamir Al-Hinai of Khoz; Said-bin-Abdullah Muhammad-bin-Mubarak Al-Janebi and others of Sur and many others of less note. 457. Saiyid Taimur also received letters from Shaikh Mohsin-bin-Zahran As-Siyabi and Shaikh Saud-bin-Ali to the effect that the rebels are preparing to advance on Maskat, but that Shaikh Isa bin Salih Al-Harithi is well disposed towards Saiyid Taimur, whom the writers advise on that account to make terms with the Imam through the Harithi Shaikh. On the other hand, it is reported that the three chief rebel-leaders, the Imam As-Salimi and Hamyar are now openly at variance among themselves and cannot at all agree as to what they should do.TTO: 190 of 1913.

On the 22nd October, one Hamaid bin Sa’id Al-Falaiti of the people of Socotra paid a visit to the Political Agent. He is an annual visitor to Maskat, appears to be a man of some importance in his own country and is well-known to the Aden authorities. He invariably, during the tenure of office by the present Political Agent, has visited him twice a year, once in the early spring on arrival at Maskat and once in the autumn at his departure. He apparently owns property in the interior and informed the Political Agent that he had been staying this year at the village of Wasil in the Wadi Ma’awal. He said that sedition had not reached that village and that, although the emissaries of the Imam had arrived there, the Shaikhs of his part of the country would not respond. 46S. It then transpired that the main object of Hamaid’s visit was that after the coming Id he wanted to hire a boat from the Batinah Coast in wliich to return with his attendants and some merchandise, apparentlv dates, to his own country, and as he was assured in his own mind that the rebels would certainly attack Maskat and Matrah either just before or after the Id, he wanted to be furnished with a kind of pass or safe conduct to ensure him against interference from the British troops or man-of-war that might take measures against such rebel attack. The Political Agent said that, if ^Hamaid was quite certain that there would be an attack, it seemed probable that measures might be taken to prevent passage of goods and traffic by sea and land between the rebel country and the outside world, and the Political Agent would, in that case, be unable to grant a safe conduct that would do more than pass individuals. 469. Hamaid seemed to be sympathetic with the rebels and to imply that he could not understand how the English could possibly interfere with the Omanis in their free choice of their own Sultan. The Political Agent assured him that, if the rebels attacked or attempted to attack Maskat or Matrah, the British troops would assuredly resist tnem. Hamaid then said that he was certain from the temper of the country that, in that case, there would be bloodshed, and said that various tribesmen and Maskatis were persuading Saiyid Taimur falsely that there was peace when there was no peace, hut that the only people on whom the Saiyid could rely were the English. 470. As these views of a man who is, it is believed, a comparatively disinterested foreigner seem interesting, they w ? ere communicated by the Political Agent to Saiyid Taimur. The latter, however, told the Political Agent that he did not anticipate an attack. 471. AH bin Abdullah Al-Khalili of the upper portion of the Samuil valley is on his way to visit Saiyid Taimur. With him are coming certain Shaikhs of the Bani Buwaha. 472. The Sultan’s yacht “ Nur-ul-Bahr ” went down to Sur on the lOth and returned on the 22nd. Qihtan bin Ya’arab of the Al-bu-Sa’id went with her on Saiyid Taimur’s behalf in response to an urgent appeal for cartridges andassistance from the Wall of Sur. He found that Shaikh Hamyar bin Nasir of the Bani Riyarn had written to the Janebah Shaikhs telling tliera to send two of their number to him to arrange for his visit, to the sons of the late Amir of Ja’alan. The Janebah Shaikhs, however, replied that they were obedient to Shaikh Taimur, and that if he tried to corne with force, he would be opposed with force. 473. The “ Nur-ul-Bahr ** found one Hamaid bin Salim bin A’amir, an influential headman of the Bani Bu-Hasan at Sur, and he asked for a passage to Maskat, as he wished to see Saiyid Taimur. He was allowed to come, but Saiyid Taimur now intends to dismiss him to his home, as other important Shaikhs of the Bani Bu-Hasan are on their way, and the Saiyid does not desire too many Bedouins to assemble in Maskat. ******* 480. The “ Al-Amran ” of Cairo in its issue of 4th October 1913 write 8 on the present situation of Oman, praising His late Highness Sir Saiyid Faisal bin Turki for his sincere desire for the welfare of his subjects and the cordial relations of the Sultanate with the British Government whieh ensure peace and prosperity to the country. The writer concludes by hoping that the present rebellion, which is based on the poisonous teachings of ignorant Mullas, will soon be at an end, and that every Arab who has any voice in Oman will rise up to suppress this evil before retribution follows.\ TELEGRAM.P.

The Jenebah Shaikhs of Sur have sent to Saiyid Taimur letters, dated 22nd October, addressed to them by Shaikh Ilamyar bin Nasir, the Tamimah of the Bani Eiyam. Shaikh Ilamyar states that he writes from Badiyah in Sharkiyah {vide page 195 of the Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf) and that the Jenebah Shaikhs wdll not be excused if they attempt to oppose the seizure, by the Imam’s forces, of the Bait-al-Mal and the towers, presumably those of Sur. He says that they can swear allegiance or remain neutral as they please. He threatens them with the armed forces of the Imam and also the loss of their possessions, namely, date-gardens and bouse property, &amp;c., in Oman itself. 482. Saiyid Taimur has also forwarded to the Political Agent for his information a letter, dated 16th October, from Shaikh Isa bin Saleh Al-Harithi. It is full of usual quotations from the Koran and is friendly in tone. It advises him to reconciliate Muhammadans and pronounces the rather startling doctrine, in the mouth of an Arab, that “ the hand of God is with the majority ” which sounds as if the writer had been studying Bismarck. 483. A loyal letter, dated 18th October, has also been shown to the Political Agent from Shaikh Abdullah bin Sa’id bin Khalfan Al-Khalili, in which the writer says that he dares not disobey Saiyid Taimur’s summons to Maskat, but, on the score of illness, asks to be allowed to postpone his visit until after the Id, and says that his son is with Saiyid Taimur for the present and will communicate all his father’s wishes and desires and receive Saiyid Taimur’s commands. 484. It is reported from Sohar that some men of the Shareki tribe waylaid 8 men of the Bani Umar who were bringing a cargo of dates to Sohar. The goods and camels were looted and 3 of the Bani Umar killed and others wounded. 485. It is reported from Sur that some of the Bani Bu-Hasan of Ja’alan have killed one man of the Bani Bu-Ali, who are making representations to Saiyid Taimur through the Wall of Sur asking for reparation, failing which, the Wali says, there will be trouble between these twe rival tribes in Ja’alan. 486. With reference to diary entry No. 473, Shaikhs Muhammad bin A’amir, Salim bin A’amir, Hamad bin Hamaid and Jumaia bin Nasir of the Bani Bu-Hasan tribe of Sharkiyah have arrived this week to visit Saiyid Taimur who is satisfied with the assurances of their loyalty and has expressed himself assured of their support in case the Imam moves in that direction. It is said that Shaikhs have pledged themselves to fight against the Harithi tribe if Shaikh Isa bin Saleh Al-Harithi joined the Imam in attacking Sur or Maskat. 487. Saiyid Nadir, accompanied by Saiyid Saif bin Badar and Munshi Muhammad Ibrahim left for Sohar in the “ Nur-ul-Bahr ” on the 1st November. The object of this visit is said to be the examination of the accounts of the Sohar customs and an enquiry into the relations of the Wali Muzaffar bin Sulaiman bin Suwailam with the local Shaikhs and inhabitants.

The Janebah Shaikhs of Sur have written to Saiyid Taimur to say that Shaikh Hamyar bin Nasir Ar-Riyami visited the Bani Bu-Ali of Ja’alan and sent messengers to the Janebah to persuade them to join the rebel cause, but that they finally replied that their loyalty to Saiyid Taimur was unchanged. 497. Saiyid Taimur also forwarded to the Political Agent a letter dated 5th instant from the Chief of Ja’alan, Ali bin Abdulla bin Salim Al-Hamudah. It is to the effect that Hamyar visited them and declared his firm resolve to attack Maskat and desired that Bani Bu-Ali should remain neutral, but that they told him that they could try and get some concessions for him from the Saiyid, but on no account excuse themselves from helping the Saiyid, with their lives and property, if need be. 498. A simultaneous communication from the Wali of Sur informed Saiyid Taimur of the failure of Hamyar to get the Bani Bu-Ali and the Janebah to join the rebels and assures him of their steadfast loyalty to Saiyid Taimur, who, the Wali suggests, should visit Sur, though for one day only, to discuss the situation there and to reassure the Janebah and the Bani Bu-Ali. 499. Shaikh Hamdan bin Zaid bin Khalifa of Abu Dhabi arrived with a following of 40 men by S. S. Bankura on the 3rd instant. He and Shaikhs Hilal bin Sa’id al-Hajri and Salim bin A’amir Al-Hasani have written jointly to Shaikh Isa bin Saleh Al-Harithi asking him to refrain from further trouble and to use his influence with As-Salimi with a view to the cessation of hostilities and arriving at a good understanding with Saiyid Taimur. It is said that these Hinawi Shaikhs have added a warning that if matters are not straightened soon all the Hinawd tribes will march out to fight against the Imam and his Ghafiri partisans. 500.

[October 30. j CONFIDENTIAL. Section 2. [49298] No. 1. India Office to Foreign Office .— (Received October 30.) Sir, India Office, October 29, 1913. I AM directed by the Secretary of State for India to forward, for the information of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, copy of a telegram that has been received from the Government of India regarding the succession of Seyyid Taimur to the Sultanate of Oman. The policy of His Majesty’s Government in such matters is to recognise the de facto ruler, and though, in ordinary circumstances, there might be some advantage in deferring recognition until the power of the new ruler to maintain his position has been demonstrated, the peculiar conditions of Oman at the present moment appear to render such a course undesirable. As, therefore, the Government of India are satisfied with the undertakings given by Seyyid Taimur, the Marquess of Orewe proposes, with Sir E. Grey’s concurrence, to authorise the immediate recognition of his succession. The desirability of making new conditions with regard to arms traffic, customs, and other matters can be considered in connection with the question of renewing the Sultan’s subsidy. I am, &amp;c. T. W. HOLDERNESS. Enclosure in No. 1. Government of India to the Marquess of Crewe. (Telegraphic.) P. October 20, 1913. THE following telegram regarding the succession to Muscat Sultanate received from Resident in Persian Gulf :— “ The present change differs considerably from previous instances; Taimur had been practically treated by us as heir apparent before Sultan Faisal died. On the 6th instant I reached Muscat, and paid the A1 Bu Saeed family unofficial visit of sympathy same day. There were present all Seyyid Faisal’s sons, also Mohammed bin Turki’s, but the latter was not present himself. My visit was returned by the family on the 8th, and on that occasion official communication of Viceroy’s message of condolence was made. At this visit neither Mohammed bin Turki nor his sons were present. Taimur’s brothers then informed Political Agent and myself, in Taimur’s presence, that they agreed that he should succeed, and promised to support him loyally. On the 9th a formal assembly of the most prominent inhabitants and retainers was held, at which Taimur installed himself, issuing thereafter an identic letter to the representatives of foreign Powers, informing them that, as his late father had directed, he had assumed the reins of government, and requesting them so to inform their Governments. At our meeting on previous day I had told Taimur that I thought he ought to address to the British Agent a supplementary statement to effect that he realised that he coidd not maintain his position without moral and material support of Great Britain, and ask the Political Agent to assure Government that he assumed all the obligations by which his father had been bound to Great Britain ; that he intended to maintain the policy followed by his father in regard to the arms traffic and other questions, and undertook (without, of course, prejudice to his independence) to ask for and be guided by our advice in all matters of importance ; that, in conclusion, he trusted that Government would strengthen him for the difficult task he had to face by recognising him officially as soon as possible. So far as Government was concerned, recognition would naturally be followed by continued payment of subsidy which his father received. In present circumstances clearly no useful purpose would be served by consulting the tribes, as more than half Oman is disloyal, the rebels claiming to have set up a new dynasty with the pretender Imam at its head. If, therefore, he wrote a letter such as I had [1908 gg —2]sketched—and this he said he was willing to do—I intended to recommend to Govern ment forthwith, without requiring any conditions besides the general undertakings already mentioned, that we should be given authority by telegram to communicate Government’s recognition of him, and to continue to pay him the subsidy as usual, provided no important change of policy in connection with his father s death was in centemplation. u Taimur first replied by letter couched in unsuitable terms, under bad advice given him, I fancy, by his relatives. This letter I refused to accept. From the 9th October to the 12th we discussed patiently the wording of the letter, and there was only one point outstanding for settlement when the incident described in my telegram immediately following occurred. Since then Taimur has sent a letter suitably worded.” The incident to which Cox refers was as follows:— Ali Musa was allowed by Taimur to remove from the warehouse certain ammuni tion in violation of the rules ; but the ammunition has since been recovered and put back in the warehouse, and an apology has been received from Seyyid Taimur. The undertakings now given by him are, we think, sufficient, and we trust that His Majesty’s Government will authorise us to instruct the Resident to tell Seyyid Taimur that he is recognised by Government as his father’s successor. We agree with Sir P. Cox that it is important in present circumstances that we should strengthen Taimur’s position by recognising him with least possible delay. We wdll consider as separate question continuance of subsidies.Confidential. No. 3695, dated Busliire, the 7th December 1913.

With reference to diary entry No. 499, it is said that Shaikh Isa bin Salih al-Harithi has returned an adverse reply saying that he will soon come down to Khoz and then see what can be done with regard to an understanding with His Highness the Sultan of Maskat, who he suggests might meet him at or near Khoz. 511. It is rumoured that a large rabble, said to be 15 to 20 thousand com posed of all the Ghafiri tribes of Oman, has freshly assembled at Samail at the bidding of the Imam and As-Salami, who, it is further stated, are going to attack Maskat shortly. But there is absence of any reliable news from the interior this week. 512. With reference to diary entry No. 500, Shaikh Ali bin Muhammad bin Salim Al-Qarawi left for his home in Murbat. Enclosure No. 2. Extract from Maskat News No, 1149, for the week ending 29th November 1913. {Received 3rd December 1913.) 539. With reference to diary entry No. 524, 100 of the Bani Bu Ali under their Shaikh, Ali bin Abdullah bin Salim, arrived in the “Nur ul Bahr ” on the 27th November and have been lodged in Khan Sahib Nasib bin Muham mad’s mosque. They were originally sent for to assist the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi in his negotiations with the rebels but, on arrival here, refused point blank to go. The Shaikh remarked, it is said, that he was more usefully employed in guarding His Highness Saiyid Taimur and that, if the British troops left Maskat, the Hinawiya, on whom His Highness was relying, would come and shoot down Saiyid Taimur in his own burza. It is said that these Bani Bu Ali are drawing pay for 300 men, while they only number 100 actual ly. The usual crop of complaints, from the peaceful inhabitants of the town against these Bani Bu Ali ruffians, has sprung up and the Political Agent has had to address a remonstrance to Saiyid Taimur on behalf of his Baluch peon Abdul, whose house was robbed the other night. His Highness replied that the Bani Bu Ali would be leaving in two or three days’ time and that lie would endeavour to arrange for compensation to the sufferer. 540 The negotiations do not appear to proceed smoothly and reports have come in from Samail that the rebels are opening their mouths very wide. One version says that Hamiyar and As-Salami demand the cession of the customs of Maskat and Matrah when they will serve Saiyid Taimur, who can remain on as Sultan. The well meant efforts of Isa bin Salih al Harathi at reconcilia tion have been rewarded by his too being styled “ Kafir ” by the other insur gents. Another rumour states that three Hinawiya have been killed up at Samailand that firing has been heard in the Ticinity of Fort Samail. The reports are probably exaggerated but certainly do not encourage any hopes of a speedy peaceful solution. 541. His Highness the Sultan received a letter from Shaikh Hamdan bin Zaid saying that Isa bin Salih was informed by a letter from As-Salami that Shaikhs Hamaiyar bin Nasir Riyami, sons of Hilal bin Zahir, late Wali of Nizwa, Ham ad* bin Nasir bin Hamaid 1 Attabi and Mohanna al ’ Ibri arrived in Samail. He also said that Shaikh Ahmad bin Muhammad bin Hilal of Hhahira had arrived in Sib and that Shaikh Abdullah bin Sa’id al Khalili wished to come to Maskat and requested the use of the steam cutter. 542. Hearing that the Wali of Sohar had been disposing of His Highness’ horses and other property, Saiyid Taimur despatched Saiyid Nadir on the 25th in the “ Nur ul Bahr ” to enquire into the report. Saiyid Nadir returned on the 27th bringing with him Mozaffur bin Sulaiman bin Suwailim, Wali of Sohar. He was immediately made a prisoner and sent up to the fort Mirani. S. G. P. L DelV—No. 902 F.

O* 1 the 17th His Highness the Sultan left for Sib in the 'Nur ul Bahr. ” ^ The same day His Highness’ steam-cutter was despatched to Kuraiyat to enquire into a case of robbery from the shop of a British subject. She re turned on the 18th and the “ Nur ul Bahr,” with His Highness on board, on the 573. This Kuraiyat incident is a curious one and we have not yet arrived at the truth of the affair. A reference is invited to item No. 382 of this diary for the week ending the 13th September, when it was reported, in all good faith, that an askari of the Wali of Kuraiyat had shot dead a Bedouin of the Bani Battash The Bunniah wdiose shop has recently been looted by the Bani Battash under the leadership of a certain Shaikh Sultan bin Muhammad bin Shamaz, puts his loss at $15,000 of which $4,000 are his property, while the balance belong to influential Bunniahs of Maskat and Matrah. This Bunniah, Jairam Nanji, is the principal Bunniah of Ivuraiyat and he has had in his service for the past four years a Baluch, Abdulla bin Muhmmad Hoti, who is practically a native of Kuraiyat and has been in Hindu service, though not in that of Jairam Nanji, for many years. There was some trouble in August between this Baluch agent and a Bedouin of the Bani Dhakar and the Baluch is re ported to have struck the Bedouin, but this fact has only been elicited from Jairam Nanji after close cross-examination. Again, as reported in September, there was the affray between the Wali’s askari, now reported to be a Hadnrami who has since been discharged, and the Bani Battash, According to Jairam Nanji, the affair was trifling; the Wali sent the askari to demand tribute of a Battashi and, if he refused,^to brino* him to the Wali’s barza in Kuraiyat The Battashi did refuse and loaded his 'un and said that he would shoot if interfered with. On this the askari returned to the Wali, when the fort was put into a state of defence, the Wali thought matters sufficiently menacing to come and report in person to his late Highness Sir Saiyid F aisal and the British subjects of Kuraiyat came in a body to His Britannic Majesty’s Consul to ask for protection. It will be seen that this report differs materially from the rumours current in Maskat in the middle of September. At an interview with Saiyid Taimur on the morning of the 21st* 2 December, His Highness stated that he had never heard that an askari of Kuraiyat had shot a Battashi and attributed the unrest among the Bani Battash to the machinations of the rebels, who had told the Bani Battash some time * ago that they were not to attack Kuraiyat in the absence of orders from the rebel chieftains. Saiyid Taimur added that Muhammad bin Shamaz was buried in the floor of the palace, as he had been executed when the Bani Battash w r ere giving trouble in his late father’s reign. The Political Agent cannot help thinking that neither the Bunniah nor His Highness have been quite candid in this question of the Bani Battash and that high handed conduct on the part of underlings of the Kuraiyat officials may be the true reason of the unrest there. Jairam Nanji has been instructed to bring his account books at Maskat and prepare a careful list, which will be checked by independent Hindu merchants of the looted property, the value of which has probably been greatly exaggerated. 574. While this Khraiyat incident shows great weakness and insecurity close to Maskat, complaints have recently been pouring in from the British subjects, again Hindu Bunnkths, residing at Suwaiq. They complain of the in action of the Walt Salim bin Sa’id who declares his inability to do anything to recover claims due from the Ayal &amp;aad or from the Arabs of Bustaq. The Political Agent, at the interview referred to, urged His Highness to send some person of trust and influence to enquire into matters there and pointed out that these reports from two different directions would naturally suggest to the British Government the inference, at a somewhat critical juncture, that His Highness’ authority w'as crumbling aw^ayaltogether. Both Kuraiyat and Suwaiq have hitherto been regarded as outside the rebel sphere of influence. 575. With reference to entry No. 559, Shaikh Hamdan bin Zaid and his brother Sagar and Salim bin Aamir, Shaikh of the Bani Bu Hassan, and their followers returned to Maskat wdth His Highness the Sultan. Hie Sultan intends to send Shaikh Hamdan bin Zaid back to Abu Thabi in the Nur-ul- Bahr ” whence he will return by land in about a month’s time, according to His Highness’ expectations. “A Paque ou a la Trinite” would probably be nearer the mark. His Highness reports that the rebel leaders are quarrelling among themselves and that Isa bin Saleh’s visits to Maskat has been regarded by the other rebels with great suspicion, and this is probably true enough, but a serious settlement or break up of the rebellion must be regarded as distant as ever.

[January 1.] CONFIDENTIAL. Section 3. [83] No. 1. India Office to Foreign Office.—(Received January 1, 1914.) Sir, India Office, December 31, 1913. I AM directed by the Secretary of State for India to forward, for the information of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, copy of a telegram that has been received from the Government of India regarding the conditions on which the subsidies granted ^ to the late Sultan of Muscat should be continued to his successor. The Marquess of Crewe agrees with the Government of India that one of these should be postponement of the revision of the commercial treaty of 1891. With regard to the suggestion made by Sir P. Cox in his telegram of the 14th October last, that the Sultan should be asked to agree to the creation (wholly or partially at his expense) of a levy corps, commanded by British or Indian officers, in the event of his failing to come to terms with the tribal chiefs, Lord Crewe proposes to consider it apart from the question of the continuance of the subsidies. He would be glad to know whether Sir E. Grey sees any objection to the proposal, either as regards any possible French opposition or as to principle or expediency. As regards the suggestion that the Sultan should further be required to undertake not to conclude fresh treaties with foreign Powers without the consent of His Majesty’s Government, I am to advert to the last paragraph of Sir It. Bitchie’s letter of the 19th July, 1911, and to say that Lord Crewe trusts that, in view of the improvecprelations now happily existing with the French Government in connection with Muscat, Sir E. Grey will see his way to open the question with them. The term “ foreign Powers ” should presumably be understood to mean Powers other than France and Great Britain. The increased interest shown by Germany in the Persian Gulf seems to make such an agreement with the Sultan even more desirable than it was two years ago, and his Lordship would prefer to make it one of the conditions of the renewed subsidies; but if difficulty and delay on the part of the French Government are to be anticipated, he realises that this may be impracticable. The Government of India do not refer to the question, which has often been discussed, of requiring the Sultan to place his customs under the management of a British or Indian official, and Lord Crewe is disposed to think that the moment is not opportune to raise it. I am, &amp;c. T. W. HOLDERNESS. Enclosure in No. 1. Government of India to the Marquess of Crewe. (Telegraphic.) P. December 23, 1913. MUSCAT succession. Please refer to your telegram dated the 1st ultimo. It is suggested by political agent that Taimur should be asked to agree that the commercial treaty of 1891 (please see in this connection my telegram of the 17th November, 1911) should be extended in its present form for five years more, or such shorter period as may be desired by us, as a condition of our continuing his subsidy. It is not expected that there would be any difficulty in securing this, and I propose to give Knox authority to carry out suggestion. He also suggests that in case the negotiations with the rebels are unsuccessful (please refer to Cox’s telegram of the 14th October enclosed in letter of the 16th idem from Foreign Secretary), Sultan should be asked to agree to the principle of establishing, as has been proposed, a levy corps at Muscat, half the cost to be paid by Sultan and remainder by us over and above his subsidy. As the Sultan is in urgent need of financial help, both Political Agent and [2001 a—3]Acting Resident wish that the payment of subsidy should not be deferred on the score of the levy corps negotiations, which may be troublesome and prolonged. I agree that question of levy corps should be matter for separate consideration. Lorimer suggests also that Sultan should be asked to pledge himself to conclude no fresh treaties with other Powers; my telegram of the 10th July, 1911, recom mended this as desirable. Pledge is one which it is very desirable to secure if possible, but if it is a question which would cause much delay, we do not desire to press it at present.Extract from Masqat diary No.288 for the week ending 14th March 1914(received on 19th March 1914). Condition of Country . 719. With reference to diary entry No.685,His Highness the Sultan received a letter from Ahmad Thanyan, Shaikh of Nakhl,reporting the presence of the enemy near Nakhl. H.H. forwarded the- letter in original to the Political Agent and despatched Saiyid Nadir to Barka on the same night - 8th March. 720. Later His Highness received a letter from Shaikh ’Isa bin Salih al Harithi to the effect that he had interviewed the Imam at Nazwa and had tried to induce him to refrain from further hostilities. The Imam,however, declined to consider any peace proposals and Shaikh *Isa the then told the Imam that he need not count on his ^Shaikh ’ s) support for the future. Shaikh f Isa stated that he had warned the Imam that,if hostilities were continued,the result would be that Oman would fall into the hands of foreigners(British). 721. Saiyid Nadir wrote to H.II.on the 12th from Barka stating that,although the rebels had threatened to attack Nakhl,no definite movement had been reported on their part. He also said that he had despatched more men to Nakhl with ammunition and that he would himself follow them later if necessity arose. Saiyid Nadir also asked for 300 men to be sent to Barka. 722. News has reached ’ r asqat that the Imam and Shaikh Hamyar,with about 1200 men,are encamped in Wadi Maawal 4 and propose making a combined attack on Nakhl. 723. News has also been received that the enemy propose to march on Masqat,Sur and Batinah in three separate bodies. 724. The reports from the interior,as a whole,are conflicting and H.H.does not anticipate any immediate combinedy?\ ® ILH ITadir combinecyattack on TTakhl. From reports received from Saiyid A he is of opinion that the local tribes with the Imam are wavering and are half hearted. Moreover some of them seem to be quarrelling amongst themselves and are therefore too busy to direct their attention to any combined attack. H.H. informed the Political Agent that he had heard from Saiyid Nadir that several British subjects had fled with, all effects from Barka without Saiyid Nadir’s knowledge and without any warning fearing that the rebels would descend on Parka. As soon as Saiyid Nadir heard of the above he assembled the remainder of the British subjects and assured them that they any need not have^fear of an attack and persuaded them to remain in Barka. 725. With reference to diary No.BR9,fresh troubles are reported in Qaryat but no details have reached Masqat yet.Telegram. P. ni From Lieutenant Colonel Penn,Political Agent,Masqat. To Major S.G.Knox,Resident Bushire,repeated Foreign Delhi. No. 63. Dated 23-3-14( 1.45 p.m.) Reference Imam’s Rising. Following is present situation. The town of Nakhl has been captured by Hamyar who commands Imam’s forces. This town has fallen through treachery of its inhabitants. Nakhl fort has so far not surrendered,it has garrison of 100 Sultan’s men and His Highness says there is plenty of ammunition and is he A confident that the defenders are loyal to hi*m. Colonel Edwardes is informed that fall of the fort is expected and that it will be signal for an advance by the rebels on Barkah. British subjects,who have fled with their families, from Barkah have been interviewed by me. They arrived in Matrah yesterday and state that they had to vacate their houses which were within, zone of fire from Fort,and that they were advised either to leave or to live in the fort. In interview with His Highness the Sultan of Masqat this morning he appeared confident that he could depend on the loyalty of his people and on their success but at the same time again requested that Man of ''ar should be sent to Barkah. This indicated that he thinks the situation grave. He had believed that garrison would be able to administer severe defeat at Nakhl,but now however seems to think Saiyid Nadir’s ability to hold Barkah is doubtful. The Sultan hopes that a Man of War will be sent to Barkah on March 23rd:. He has summoned his loyal Shaikhs to meet him there on that date when consultation as to plans of opera tions to be undertaken against rebels. I have requested Senior Naval Officer to send a ship if he can spare one conveniently,and hope ray action will meet with approval. I have again been pressed by His Highness for an answeranswer regarding the Persian gunners who have 'been detained at 3ushire,and also the loan he has asked for.

They stated that they were advised by SaiyidNadir either to live inside the fort or leave Barka.Extract from Masqat diary No.322 for the week ending 28th March 1914(received 2nd April 1914). Condition of Country . 753. With reference to diary entry No.740,some disquieting news was received at the end of last week to the effect that the Imam was advancing on Nakhl with reinforce ments and that after capturing the Nakhl Fort x±*k he would proceed to attack Barka. 754. On the 22nd H.M.S.'Dartmouth' arrived at Masqat and on the 23rd the Political Agent proceeded in her to Barka and returned to Masqa’t the same night. His Highness had intended proceeding to Barka also the same day hut the 'Nur ul Bahr' did not arrive at Masqat having been delayed at Sohar embarking reinforcements to protect Barka. The Political Agent interviewed Saiyid Nadir in the fort. Saiyid Nadir confirmed the news of the Iman^s intention to attack Barka. 755. The Political Agent also reassured the British subjects still residing at Barka who were much excited at the reports of the Imam's approach. The 'Dartmouth' remained at Barka until the 26th when she returned to Masqat and was relieved by the 'Alert'. 756. With reference to diary entry No.738,the 'Nur ul Eahr' returned from Khabura and Barka on the 25th. She is said to have brought some 300 Bedouind from Khabura and landed them in Barka. The 'Nur ul Bahr' proceeded to Sur on the 26th and returned to Masqat on the 27th with about 200 Bani bu Hassan - vide diary entry No.743 - and after taking His Highness on board proceeded to Barka the same morning. She also carried one gun and about 30 imported Baluchis (vide entry No.757 below). It is reported that His Highness will join his brother,Saiyid Nadir,and both will then proceed to attack the rebels at Nakhl possibly under the leadership of His Highness himself. 1757757. Haji Kasim, 7 /ho was sent by Hie Highness the Sultan about one month ago to Basrah,to enlist some trained Baluchi soldiers,returned to Masqat on the 25th by the fast mail S^/’Kola” . He brought with him 25 Baluchi soldiers 2 of whom have Turkish uniforms and are said to be gunners. They speak Arabic and Baluchi. 25 more are expected by the next fast mail. 758. 16 ponies and 12 camels arrived by the slow mail S.S. w Lindula' on the 25th from Gwadur. They are said to have been sent to His Highness by Sardar Mehrab Khan Gitchki. They are intended as 'gun teams' and were being practised in their work on the parade ground of Masqat prior to their departure for Barka. 759. H.M.S.

Gener°l situation appears disquieting and Sultan's efforts to raise money and enlist foreign aid do not reassure me. Following are most significant items of news: (1) Sultan has apparently appealed to Wali of Basrah for help in money or men. (2) A Jamadar Qasim, lately returned from Basrah, is said to have arranged with a Pa than * Abclur Rahman, Jamadar Chohidar of Messrs Gray Mackenzie Basrah, to enlist 200 Pathans for service vn th Sultan• (3) An attempt is to be made to enlist Baluchis from Rampur. (4) *Ali bin Salim, late Sultan's cousin, accompanied by 'Abdul 'Aziz, French Consulate dragoman, visited French Con sul three tines on 3rd April. We cannot regard with equanimity any of these measures: (1) It is difficult to see what possible response '^ali Bas rah can give to this wild appeal and I think Political Agent might simply address a remonstrance to the Sultan showing its futility and folly. (2) and (3) Unorganised Nathans and Baluchis will only add to disorderly elements in town and probably decamp with any rifles and ammunition given them, possibly purchasing others. They will be entirely useless against local arabs. Political Agent should emphatically discourage these plans. (4) I think Political Agent should endeavour to learn inde pendently and by direct enquiry from His Highness signifi cance of 'Ali bin Salim's visits to French Consul. A talk over situation with his French Colleague might possiblyposaibly ©licit useful iiifozTiatioii* H© shoul port result by telegraph. T-?ue has, I think,- now come for a straight talk with Sultan pointing out the idiocy/^/ of wasting money on his arab iorces. The 'Omani tribes are following out their old policy of bleeding Sultan. One section draw pay from him and render no service in exchange, the other are in possession of hir territory and feed on his estates. He should be warned that we will not lend money to be squandered in these direc tions and aha. 1 1 forbid our subjects to lend him money either, until he gi/es us guarantee that these loans and the revenues of the country are being spent in serious efforts to paci^j »« .l ^, ©specially the Wadi Samuil. For t]E$© rresent, it seems impossible o do anything except stick to the Masqat Matrah enclave organise the Levy dorps and prepare for an advance to Sair.ail in October next. The object of this advance would be to install Nadir, or some other well qualified selection of Sultan there as Governor, hare Forts at ?idbid and Sanail put in thorough order and garrisoned by at least a company each of the new Levy Corps, whose head quarters should be in Sib. It would probably be necessary to leave a double company with machine gun section at Bait al Falaj to frighten off any marauding raids down Wadi f Adai behind hack of Wadi Sam&amp;il. Political advisers, preferably selected nativ|&lt; of India, paid from Customs revenues and in close touch with Political Agent, would be require^, one at Masqat for Sultan and one at Sa^ail for Nadir. Latter could gradually in consul tation with Nadir subsidise selected tribal petty chiefs to maintain communications from Samail to Sib and Masqat. When these arrangements are complete, our troops could with draw. It is essentially a cold weather job and would necessi tate employ lent of troops for from two to three months next winter and maintenance of Bait al Falaj garrison to the end of the year. But it seems the only hope of re-establishing Sultan’s authority, a useful asset to us. As price of this material assistance, Sultan should undertake to manage Masqat69 'H&gt; l Masqat and Matrah customs under our advice and devote Zanzibar subsidy to expense of Levy Corps and secret but effective understanding that he ^111 correspond with no foreign governments unrepresented at Masqat exceptjthfrough us* In our tun, e bear all costs of expedition to re-establish his authority in samail and balance of expenditure on nevy Co^pn* ivnoxjORak. «r w .

Firstly. Sultan read .prefaced reuarks on present situation by referring to delay ii sanctioning of loan. I told him loan had been n»v,- sanctioned and added as he had referred to the subject of delay I would explain reason for it and I then did so in the sense of Government of India 's tele^prtPJ Fo: 185.S. Aprl 4th: His Mighness frankly admitted iJurchase of tVvo( ) guns from French . He said he had recently purchased a breech loader gun from British Firm and as he could not find partleu-lar pattern of snail quick firing gun which he required on British market , he had placed order with a French firm . Ke maintains he had full liberty of selection in such matters . i said the news of the French transaction received , as it was, simultan eously with his request for British loan ,had not unnaturally suggested there was perhaps some connection between the two and caused some hesitation on the part of Government . He replied French guns had already been paid for and would be imported strictly in accordance with Masqat Warehouse regulations and that money asked Tor now was for oppwrations against the rebels and ririintanance of mis present following . in conclusion he begged me to convey to Government of India his deep gratitude 101 ■ LOd l « aas now taken Rs: 10,000 and proposes to draw similar ammounts at intervals of week or so , he will reAmd 5,ooo monthly. Secondly, imam’s Rising. Sultan thought situation most critical .

I estimate Sultan’s following at Barka at 1,500 hut I think His Highness realises, what is undoubtedly a fact ,that all except oerha_)s Baluchis are throughly unreliable . All this together with loss of Nakhl Fort has suite disheartened him. He now awaits certain Shaikhs from Batinah and will discuss further action with them. Sultan arrived here unexpectidly yesterday ,indisposed but after few hours Returned to Barka . he was not able to receive visit from Admiral but he sent a to Barka. Thirdly .

K, From Major S.G.Kno®,Resident Bushire. To Foreign Simla,repeated Admiral and Political Agent,Masqat and Lieutenant Colonel Benn,c/o 'Fox' No. 436. Dated 11.4.14.(3.16 p.m.) Reference telegram dated April llth:No.77 from Masqat. I trust that the authority of Government may be speedily conveyed to H.M.S. 'Fox' to assist the Sultan in the critical position of affairs in every possible way from the sea. Unless,however thera is an unexpected improve ment in the situation,action should tend more,it would seem,in the direction of present withdrawal than in active opposition to the rebels. In selecting the beginning of the hot weather for renewal of activity,the rebels have done well. I take it we have no wish to undertake military operations at present and His Highness appears unable to oppose tebels. I entirely agree with the opinion of His Excellency and Political Agent that the rebels should be shelled out,if they are in occupation of Barkah. Following two questions seem to ask for considera tion without much delay 1. If Political Agent should not advise His Highness to disband unreliable tribal following and thus husband his financial resources. 2. If reinforcements should not be sent to Masqat garrison. No doubt,should it be found necessary to with draw from Barkah,sea patrol will be maintained to watch coast from Barkah to Matrah. If man of war is there ready to shell large forces of men moving along coast, possible advance on oapital would be hampered.j’ro.i, Beiui r Masqat . • &gt;x 9 Bid© . k ' foreign. No: 81.

H.H. informed me that yimmedlately on his arrival». the Ban! Battash had fired on him from, three places* viz: from a fort in the town, f roriu an island in the harbour and from the soa shore, anti that they/only stopped the firing on the approach of the man of war. Certain local residents had join ed, the Bani Battash. These, while professing loyalty to H.H. had refused, their support to. the Wall &amp; had sheltered the Bani Battash and encouraged. them in the destruction of the Baluchi habitations by fire. With.the exception of the fort in which .the Wall &amp; some 400 Baluchis had.taken refuge,the whole.town had boon occupied by enemy who had set up white standards. Shortly after my arrival His Highness sent a message ashore de-‘ manding the surrender of the fort and.the despatch to him of.the rebel headmen within an hour, and* intimating to them that in case of non compliance their positions would be demolishod. B.H. waited for hours,and there being no signs of compliance H.H. came on boaro the'Dartraouth' and at his request the man of war demolished. the rebel fort and other positions pointed out by H.H. The above raentionod island was also shelled. The rebels and the disloyal inhabitants mentioned above fled and thus releasing the Sul tan*s.troops &amp; subjects who had boon besieged in their fort for 6 days. The besieged garrison then set fir*.to all the huts and property of the disloyal Inhabitants who had gone over to th© brbit enemy. After dark H.H. sent a party of men ashore to clear .tho\ island under search light; but it was found to be unoccupied. .The Sultan then signalled. that he fas. in HBB&amp; no furcther need of assistance and. that he was himself leaving for Sur at once &amp; would return as soon as possible, to Muscat.

Please refer to the correspondence ending with your telegram po. 115, dated the 28th April 1914, regarding your unfortunate mistake in discussing with . His Highness the Sultan of MasRat, the matters referred to in the concluding paragraph of Political Resident, Bushire's telegram No. 423, dated the 9th of April 1914. v our telegram N 0 . 103, dated 22nd April, puts us in possession of your explanation as to how you came to make the mistake and it is of course accepted, hut we cannot hut think that if the Resident’s telegram No. 423, and Foreign Department telegram No. 207, referring lo it had been considered together with due care, there should nave been no loop hole for the error into which you fell. It is true that the Bushire telegram No. 423 contained two paragraphs headed 'Fourthly', but you appear to have failed to grasp the arrangement,. In / this telegram the Political Resident first mentioned four significant items of news, numbered firstly, secondly,&amp; secondly, thirdly and fourthly. He then proceeded to comment on eacn item in turn under its own number and recommended certain action in each case, thus the item of news numbered 'fourthly' referred to the visit of All-Bin Salem to the French Consul and the second 'fourthly' suggested what action should be taken in that connection. This clause ended with the words 'he should report by telegraph', after which came the group 'Full stop, t: ew paragraph'. In this new paragraph the Political Resident started afresh to review the general situation and to suggest measures wnich mignt he possible eventually for improving it. Apart from the possibility of leyyud Taimur having taken alarm at some of your allusions, much harm may not have been done locally; but we are necessarily exercised by the thought that the gist of ^our discussion with the Fultan nay have reached the ears of the French Consul and that in convenient enquiries from the French Government may result.

Shaikh Haiadan^ efforts have had no result, partly on account of the pearling season, the lack of money on the Trucial Coast owing to the poor prices at which last year* catch was sold, and the difficulty for the Bedouin of moving their animals about during the heat. The inference that the rebel chieftains will probably # find it equally difficult to induce their partisans to stir up serious trouble for His Highness durin * the presen o aoon is interesting.
