The wing cases are separated by a single incised line. The back of the scarab is worn. There are two forward curving lines on the back, near the rear, which are either cracks or intentional. The legs are given in relief.\r\n\r\nCondition: There are traces of deep green glaze in the hieroglyphs, and in the hollows by the legs. The glaze on the rest of the scarab has turned grayish.
