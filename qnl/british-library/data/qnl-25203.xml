A., First Assistant in charge of current duties, Bushire. I have the honour to report that His Highness the Sultan applied to me, on the 17th February, for a draft on London for £150 in favour of Messrs. Clahrough and Johnstone. His Highness had also at the same time purchased some £200 worth of the arms of Messrs. Laubenburg and Co., and I accordingly, on receipt of the money on both accounts, arranged for its remittance to London to my hankers Messrs. C. Hoare and Co., of 37, Fleet Street, E. C., drawing cheques them, dated 20th March 1914, one in favour of Messrs. Clabrough and Johnstone, Birmingham, for £150, which I handed to the Superintendent of the Maskat Arms’ Warehouse on behalf of His Highness the Sultan and the other for £263-9-4 in favour of the Chief Clerk, London Foreign Office, for payment to Messrs. Laubenhurg and Co., remitting to them in this way all the sums that I had been able to realise up to the date of the remittance, on their account from the sale of their goods detained in the Maskat State Warehouse. 2. I was aware that His Highness had for some time been contemplating the purchase of a machine or small field gun which he proposes to use, if neces sary, in the operations he intends to undertake shortly against the Omani rebels and the letter, of which I enclose a copy, dated 16th February 1914, from the Superintendent of the Maskat Arms’ Warehouse to Messrs. Clahrough and Johnstone, Birmingham, now indicates clearly the object for which His High ness required the draft of £150. His Highness has not consulted me either as to the purchase of this mountain gun or as regards the operations he intends to undertake against the rebels, though he has, in the course of conversation, in formed me of his intentions. 3. As to refuse to assist His Highness in this matter would probably only have resulted in some attempt, possibly through French sources, to obtain the gun on which he has set his heart in some clandestine fashion, I thought it best to fall in with his plans to the limited degree rhat I have reported above, in order that I might be, in due course of time, fully acquainted with what was going on. I trust that my action in the matter may be approved. It is possible that the accident on the Mowlad an Nabi, reported as item No. 669, in my diary for the week ending 14th February 1914, may explain the last portion of the Superintendent’s letter. 4.

Treasury to Foreign Office.—{Received December 16.) Sir, Treasury Chambers, December 15, 1913. I HAVE laid before the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury Sir W. Langley’s letter of tbe 26th ultimo, with enclosures relative to the provisional agreement come to by Colonel Tisclall—for whose services in this matter my Lords desire to express their appreciation—with the two French firms interested in the arms traffic at Muscat. My Lords note that the expenditure which will he required as compensation for the French firms amounts in all to 64,495/., and that Secretary Sir E. Grey is of opinion that no less costly method of meeting the difficulties of the position at Muscat can be hoped for. In these circumstances my Lords will not withhold their sanction to a provision being made in the Diplomatic and Consular Estimates for 1913-14 for a moiety (viz., 32,247/. I Os.) of this sum, it being understood that the Government of India will undertake to make the necessary disbursements on this account in the event of the negotiations with the French Government coming to a conclusion before the 31st March next, and necessitating an immediate settlement of the claims of the French firms. My Lords take note that the value of the arms which it is proposed to purchase from these firms, and which will then become the property of the British and Indian Governments, is placed at 40,895/., and that it is anticipated that a considerable portion of this sum will be gradually recovered by the sale of arms. The moiety of the receipts from such sales should he brought to the credit of the Diplomatic and Consular Vote. I am, &amp;c. T. L. HEATH.

The provisional agreehient resulting from these negotia tions has now been discussed with Colonel Tisdali, and Sir E. G-rey is of opinion that this agreement is a very satisfactory one. It will be seen from this despatch and from those previously forwarded to you that the only poin^ still outstanding is whether His Majesty’s Gov eminent should take over for Five thousand tv/o hundred and sixty- three pounds the stock of arms reshipped by Monsieur Dieu from Muscat to Jibuti. Colonel Tisdall recommends that His Majesty’s Government should agree to this proposal, and represents that they are arms which should not be allowed iT - ' The Under Secretary of State India Office. 29 NOV 1313 -: *(52797/13) allowed to pass into other hands. There can be little doubt that if they are not acquired by His Majesty's Govern ment tney will either find their way back to Muscat or will sold to the Abyssinians, while if they are bought the loss on them when they are resold should be comparatively snail. For these reasons Sir E. Grey is disposed to concur in Colonel Tisdall's opinion that they should be taken over. If Lord Crewe agrees with this opinion Sir E. Grey proposes to instruct His Majesty's Ambassador at Paris to let Monsieur Dieu know the decision of His Majesty's Government on this point, and to inform the French Embassy that a provisional agreement has now been reached with the arms dealers, and that the way is consequently clear for the discussion with the French Government of the terms of the agreement by which the validity of the arms regulations is to be recognised. Sir E. Grey also proposes to thank Colonel Tisdall warmly for the able manner in which he has conducted the negotiations and to congratulate him on their successful issue. Copy[This Docament is the Property of His Britannic Maifisty’s Government,] WITH reference to your letter of the 21st ultimo, respecting the proposals for the settlement of the question of the arms traffic at Muscat, I am directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to transmit to you herewith, for the information of the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury, copy of despatches from His Majesty’s Ambassador at Paris respecting the negotiations between Colonel Tisdall and the Erench dealers.‘ :;: ' It will be seen that Colonel Tisdall has reached a provisional agreement with the firms interested in the trade on the following terms :— M. Louis Eieu to receive 8,632/. for his stock at Muscat and 13,600/. as compen sation for the loss of his trade : Messrs. Goguyerto receive 27,000/. for their stock and 10,000/. as compensation. It is also proposed that M. Lieu’s stock at Jibuti should be taken over in the same way as the stocks at Muscat, for a payment of 5,263/. The manner in which these figures have been arrived at is fully described in the enclosed despatches, but it may he mentioned that the estimate made by the British authorities at Muscat of the value of the stocks was 12,937/., while the owners’ valuation originally amounted to 59,524/., and from information received privately before the negotiations began, there was reason to believe that the two firms would not be satisfied with any sum which fell far short of 200,000/. Sir E. Grey considers therefore that the bargain arrived at by Colonel Tisdall, who was at great pains to ascertain the exact value of all the various arms included in the stocks, as well as the percentages which might reasonably be allowed for commission, freights, profits, Ac., is a very satisfactory one. As regards the stock of arms at Jibuti, the property of M. Louis Lieu, I am to observe that these arms were originally consigned to Muscat, and were removed by the proprietor to Jibuti owing to the operation of the arms regulations. The stock consists mainly of '303 rilles, carbines, and cartridges, and it would be undesirable that these weapons should be allowed to fall into other hands. If they were not now acquired by His Majesty’s Government they would probably either be sold in. Abyssinia and eventually come into the hands either of the Somali Mullah’s adherents or the tribesman on the frontiers of the Soudan or East Africa Protectorate, or that they would find their way back to Muscat, while if they are purchased, Sir E. Grey is advised that the loss on them when they are resold ought to be comparatively small, and he therefore considers that it would be desirable to agree to Colonel Tisdall’s proposal in this respect. X Of the 64,495/. which, under this agreement, it is proposed to expend, a sum of 40,895/. would thus be spent on taking over the stocks of arms and ammunition already in the Persian Gulf. These arms it is intended to retain at Muscat, to be used as required to supply the requirements of the Sultan of Muscat the Sheikh of Koweit and other authorities in the Gulf, and it is hoped therefore, that a considerable proportion of this sum will gradually be recovered as the arms are sold. Sir E. Grey is, however, not at present in a position to give any estimate of the amount which will be so recovered. The reasons for which Sir E. Grey and the Marquess of Crewe considered it necessary to come to the agreement with the arms dealers have been described in the previous correspondence with your Lepartment, and lam now 7 to express the hope that the Lords Commissioners will be prepared to sanction the expenditure of 32,247/. 10s. or a moiety of the total expenditure proposed for the purposes indicated. Half of the sums realised from time to time by the sale of the arms w T ould be credited to His Majesty’s Government, so that the total sum paid out would in course of time be ABMS TEAEEIC.

No payment would of course be made to the firms interested until a satisfactory agreement has been reached with the French Government as to th recognition by them of the regulations in force at Muscat, and of the right of His Majesty’s Government to have these regulations amended. Sir E. Grey is sensible that the sum which it is proposed to spend on buying out the dealers is, even taking into account the properties which will be acquired', a large one. In view however of the great importance of bringing the traffic in the Persian Gulf under complete control, and of doing so in a manner which will not alienate the French Government, he has no hesitation in recommending this scheme to the favourable consideration of their Lordships.

Colonel Tisdall has left for London to-day I have, &amp;c (Signed) Francis Bertie le Right Honourable Sir E. Grey, Bart., K.G. &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.3 November 17th, 1913. Sir: - I have the honour to inform you, v/ith reference to ray Despatch No. 2 of the 13th instant, that agreements have been arrived at with Monsieur Louis Dieu and the representatives of Messrs. Goguyer in regard to their claims for compensation for loss of trade, amounting to:- Monsieur Louis Dieu £13,600 Monsieur Goguyer ' £10,OCX) Total £23,600 The settlements were arrived at in the following manner. The French traders were required to produce evidence of their sales at Free-on-Board prices and of their annual average profits for the three years ending August 1912. These statements were produced, Monsieur Dieu's from his books in Paris and Messrs. Goguyer f s from certified documents extracted from the firm’s books at Muscat. They were checked as far as was i Honourable Sir Francis Bertie, G.G.B., G.G.M.G., G.G.V.O., &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.was possible by figures obtained from the Board of Trade Customs Returns and by information collected during the course of the negotiations. I onsieur Dieu only started business at Muscat in 1909 but he proved that it had mpidly progressed, while Messrs. Goguyer were an old established firm whose business was declining. Monsieur Bieu’s average annual profit from 1909-1912 worked out at £6,800. Compensation for loss of trade on a basis of one year s profit was at first discussed. Monsieur Dieu 1SiCOd f0r Blx a Iia11 ' years' profit and declared that he would not accept less than five years' profit. In view of the fact that his first year of business affected the average of his annual profit adversely, and of its prospective increase, I offered him two years' profit. This Monsieur Dieu refused to agree to. At a final Interview he appealed for more equitable treatment, urging that the total of £13,600 would not cover his actual liabilities to European firms. He further argued that had he not stopped shipment his stock at Muscat would have been more than double what it was and his compensation for it would have been i; ,* ! | j j l 1 I I much■&gt;nuch Skater. He once more raised the question of Ms shipment of aims from Muscat to Jibuti, end assured me that if only these a^s could he included the approximate sum of £5 263 he would he prepared to accept two years- profit in full settlement, i Informed Mm that I had not yet received instructions on this question, hut in view of what he had advanced I would support his request, a list is enclosed. As to Messrs. Goguyer-s claim for compensation of trade, having regard to the signs of the i firm's declining trade, T offered a sum of £3,ooo. Monsieur Georges Leroy, on behalf of the fi ra -s authorised representative, Monsieur Leopold Elba,, asked for three years- profit, which he estimated on tne lowest possible computation at £30,000. He subsequently produced a statement based on shipments from European ports over three years, which showed an average annual profit of £14,422. He again reverted to Ms claims for dhows and buildings at Muscat and stocks of ams and ammunition at Koweit and Katar (see my Bespdtch No. 2 of the 13th instant) and I infomed him that these claims could not be entertained. Messrs. GrOguyer'sGoguyer'6 representatives ultimately agreed to accept a sum of £10,000 In full compensation. I hold offers in writing from the representative^ of the two firms to settle for the sums mentioned. A copy of the minutes of the negotiations is enclosed herein.

(l) Monsieur Louie Dleu called at the Embassy at 10..50 a.m., and negotiations commenced at once. Monsieur Dieu presented a copy of the inventory of the arms and ammunition, his property, at Muscat in substantial agreement with that contained in Major S.G.Knox s despatch to Six’ Edward Grey No. 163 Confiden tial of September 2nd 1S13. (2) Monsieur Dieu further claimed compensation for a stock of arms and ammunition valued at £10,000 not ^ included in the Muscat inventory, but which had been consigned to Muscat and reconsigned to Jibuti owing to the operation of the new regulations and he handed in a detailed statement. Monsieur Dieu was informed that the instructions received made no mention of arms at Jibuti and the matter was deferred for the present. (3) Monsieur Dieu then said he had a claim for arms to the value of £2,900 ordered and alleged to be in the hands of the British and German suppliers reaay for shipment. He stated that the various firms were pressing him to accept delivery and pay for these arms.He handed in a list but admitted that he could produce no contract. This claim was reserved. Monsieur Dieu also mentioned that Messrs Kynoch were claiming compensation for non-acceptance of delivery of 11 million rounds of .503 ammunition held on a tacit underfitmaing (i.e., not expressly ordered).

He explained that they wen included under a separate heading of 'various'.'various', added by him to the form. He undertook to tabulate them for the next meeting in the same form as the rest of his Muscat stock. 9 (b) It was explained to Monsieur Dieu that the totals of each detail in the statement had been worked out on a percentage basis and they were then discussed in the order of the form. Price,F.P.B . The total under this heading amounted to 149,109.35 francs and was admitted, being less than the in voice price given in the Muscat inventory. Freight and Insurance . Monsieur Dieu was tola that an English Firm had given the price of freight and insurance to Muscat as being 35/- per ton and insurance lk\ He questioned this quotation on both charges, and argued that the rata from Manchester was 75/- per ton on arms and anmunition and that it was applied by the shippers by weight or bulk, whichever was to their advantage. He said that the price was formerly 60/- but that it had been 75/- since July 1912. Monsieur Dieu undertook tc produce shippers* receipts to support his statement. MonsieurMonsieur Dieu gave i% as the rate for insurance. Customs Dues . Monsieur 'Da.su’s figures showed a rate of 10.g? for customs. He was asked to explain this rate, seeing that the rate g^ven by the Board of Trade v/as ffo. Monsieur Dieu argued that the rate was ^ and that it ms charged on the Muscat selling value arbitrarily f ixta Mv the Customs. A tajc of 1 Maria Theresa Dollar had also to be paid for each rifle and every 1000 rounds oi am minirion. This statement was subsequently cor- / racted by telephone to the effect that the Muscat customs rate was 5/- except for arms and ammunition which had to pay (j; .■ and 1 a dollar (lfr»2f3) was levied on each rifle and not on ammunition. Tne question of obtaining direct information on this point from Muscat was mentioned. Agent 1 s Commission . Monsieur Blau's figures worked out on a percentage basis give 10.&amp;o. Monsieur Dieu was informed that 3^o would be a more reasonable rate (a rate accidentally mentioned by Monsieur Klbaz when he called alone on November 3in). lonsieur Dieu admitted after some discussiondiscussion that his agent was entitled to a fixed commission of but stated that he also received a share of profit after a certain limit had been reached. Monsieur Dieu finally agreed to accept 3# for the Agent's Commission, seeing that the percen-age for Profits was still to be discussed* Profits * Monsieur Dieu's statement works out at a percent age for profit of 144/b and it was pointed out to him that such a rate could of course not be referred to Hie Majesty's Government as being a reasonable rate of profit. 30;b was mentioned as being a more reason able rate and it was pointed out that other firms had made some transactions in arms with Muscat for only 10;o profit. Monsieur Dieu said that he knew that several English firms, Livingstone Zeytoun and Company, Times Dharwar and Company, traded with Muscat dealers o-n a wholesale basis but he argued that his own trade was a retail business carried on at Muscat and that he was thus able to derive much higher profits. It was represented to Monsieur Dieu that 3Q/o was the maximum rate which it was possible to offer and that there was i a very wide difference between that and 144 c ' demanded. Monsieur(5) OtT) Monsieur Dleu than asked whether Colonel Tisdall was empowered by His Majesty's Government to make a definite offer. He was Informed that Colonel Tis- dall'e Instructions were to endeavour to arrive at a reasonable price „d referendum . Monsieur Dieu stated j that he was prepared to make concessions on his percentage of profits but wished first to know how / his claim for compensation for loss of trade would be dealt with. T -e was informed that the claim for the Muscat Ptocks must he settled first. Monsieur Dieu finally agreed to SOI' profit provisionally. i (4) Jibuti Arms . Monsieur Dieu explained that these arms were shipped to Muscat In September and October 1912 and re shipped to Jibuti in May 1913. They 7 /ere reshipped to Jibuti to avoid loss from thefts which frequently occurred in the Muscat customs houses. He remarked tnat it would bo to the advantage of His Majesty’s Government to include these arms in the Muscat settle ment as otherwise Arab dealers at Muscat would send to Jibuti to take delivery of them.( 1 — lit naiicib ol Tyho iflunul acturera . Monsieur Dieu was asKec what was his liability towards the manufacturers for these goods for not accepting delivery.

It was pointed out that Monsieur Elbaz's 'Bon pour pouvoir* only named three of the five parties mentioned in the heed of Executorship^ Monsieur Jean Goguyer* s widow and Madame Leopold Elbaz being excluded. It was agreed that Monsieur Elbaz v/ould telegraph to Kenchela in Algeria for a similar *Bon pour pouvoir^ to complete his authority. (2) Stocics at Muscat . The statement handed in by Monsieur Elbaz had been /oriced cut on the same percentage basis ig in- dicated in XIX ( 2 ) and it was discussed under each heading. The figures in the statement contained slight errors both ways amounting in all to an overcharge of 139 Frs. This was not contested. Price F.Q.B . The figures given under this heading were the same as those mentioned in the inventory for invoice prices at / ill Iat Muscat and it was proposed to establish the F.O.B. price at a i$Z reduction. This was based on the fact that ammunition was declared in Customs returns at 2Q/o loss laian invoice V!xlue while rifles were declared a^ a pi ice --lose to the invoice value ^ resulting in approximate average reduction of iC9b: Monsieur Leroy established the fact that the declaration to Customs was below the cost price. Colonel Tisdali proposed to take the F.O.B. price at 1C less than the Invoice value. The discussion on this point was held over at Monsieur Leroy’s request. Subsequently Colonel Tisdali raised the question of depreciation on value of stocks and it was then agreed that 10% reduction on invoice values should stand. Freight and Insurance. Monsieur Elbaz’s statement gives as the rate. Monsieur Leroy produced figures showing that the rate on ammunition was 3i%. It was agreed to accept 2r as the mean rate for arms and ammunition. Customs Charges . Monsieur Elbaz’s list included under this head 'divers’ 1 which he explained meant small expenses con nected with landing cargoes, and amounted to SF' fortor customs was agreed to. The &amp; for 'divers' was objected to and reauced to 1^. ^ was thus arrived at as the rate under this heading. Agent 1 e Coiamiss inn . Monsieur Elbaz claimed under this head. It was elicited in the course of discussion that a ^ commission was paid under contract to the agent Humza and that Monsieur Abraham Elbaz (a cousin of Monsieur Leopold Ribas) was entitled to &amp; of the profits on cash sales. ^ 3/&gt; was accepted as the Agent’s Commission hut the 2/o demanded for Monsieur A. Elbafc was rejected as being included under Profits. Profi ts. Monsieur Eibaz’s statement showed a profit of 3^? on invoice prices. 3CF- was agreed upon. (3) Anns at Katar rind Koweit . Monsieur Elbaz's statement included stocks at Katar ('Qatar w ) find Koweit amounting to £5791. He was informed that these were not included in the Muscat inventory and the claim could therefore not be con sidered. In answer to a question Monsieur Elbaz declared that he was anxious to dispose of these stocks.stocks, (4) Comx.snsatlcn for loss af trade . Information of the firm's sales and profits for 3 years ending June 30th, 1912 »as asked for, and Monsieur Leroy produced a statement of profits for 3 years ending August 31st 1913 and a statement of receipts extracted from the firm's booxs and certified hy the French Consul at ?

After contesting the method which had been em ployed in the formula for arriving at percentages of freight and Assurance which according to his own estimate he should produce 4% and insisting that Muscat customs duty on arms is plus t a dollar per rifle. Monsieur Dieu consented to accept the whole formula nrovision^lly as follows:- F.O.B. price 100 Freight and Assurance 2i Customs Charges 6 Agents Commission 3 Profit 3Q- Total 141i This acceptance Monsieur Dieu expressly subjected to an agreement being reached on Compensation for loss of trade. (3) Comeeneation for Loss of Trade . Monsieur Dieu had been asked by telephone to furnish particulars of his profits and sales at Muscatat F.O.B. prices for the three years September 1st, 1909-August 31st 1912. In reply he came to the Embassy and presented a typewritten Memorandum to the effect that before giving the information asked for he must know by what method it was proposed to deal with his claim for compensation. Further with regard to his claims for arms at Jibuti and in Europe if these were not included in the instructions he proposed to add a sum of Francs 200,000 to the compensation and retain possession of the arms and ammunition in question. Monsieur Dieu undertook to produce a statement of arms and ammunition at F.O.B. price sold at Muscat for the three above indicated years, and also his net profit for those three years.XXII. November 13. MQBBrs. moituyer ^s claim for compensation for loas of ' * trade. (l) At their last meeting Messrs. Eltaz and Leroy had deposited two documents certified correct according to the Company's books by the wrench Consul at uscat. They were (a) A form of cash receipts for the period October 16th 1909 to August 31st, 1913, Showing a toUJ. of Prs. 4,434, 607 (£177,384), an average of Prs. 1,182,562 (£47,302) per annum. (b) A statement of profits for the same period amounting to Frs. 1,184,707.69 (£47,388) a yearly average of Prs. 330,716 (£13,224). Messrs. Elbaz and Leroy called at 3 p.m. They were informed that the statements were of interest but that the figures could not be accepted as entirely relevant to the claim for compensation for loss of trade. Such a claim was only entertained by His Majesty*s Government as an act of grace and the figures produced, which doubtless covered the whole of the firm’s trade at Muscat and other ports, could i not be recommended as a basis for settlement. Monsieur Leroy on being asked whether he wished to put forward anyany more reasonable proposal said he had no other data on which to speak for his client. He was then informed that taking a basis of three years Customs declarations at British ports plus i for shipments from foreign ports, which proportion was taken from the stocks at hiscat, Messrs. Coguyer's total trade at ■tf.O.B. prices for 1909, 1910 and 1911 was £13,071, an average of £4,357. 3Q^ profit on this amount gives a yearly average of £1,307. Monsieur Leroy declared that this calculation was so far from the actual figures of shipments that he asked to be allowed to prove it to be wrong by telegraphing to Muscat for details of shipments from England, France, Belgium, and Germany during those years. He proposed to ask the firm's agent at Muscat to have the amount certi fied by the French Consul and telegraphed by him to the Ministry for foreign Affairs. He was told that Colonel Tisdall had no instructions to negotiate with the French Government and that His Majesty's Grovern- ment could only pay on the infomnation obtained from their own sources. Considering the declining state of the firm's business owing to competition, the death of Monsieur GroguyerGoguyer ajid o . cai Bes the sum ot £3,000 was proposed as adequate compensation. Monsieur Leroy asked whether information from Muscat in reply to his proposed en quiry would in any way modify Colonel Tisdales proposal. He was informed that Colonel Tisdall would oe glad to see an&gt; additional information but could not in advance undertake to modify his proposal or change the ground on which it was based. Monsieur Leroy said he would telegraph privately to Muscat and also that he would have to communicate the proposal to the members of the Goguyer family at present in Paris. Colonel Tindall remarked that he intended to leave Paris on Tuesday and would be glad to receive Messrs. Leroy and Elbaz on any day before that if they had any other proposal to make or decision to communicate. Ikmsieur Elbaz seemed perturbed at this remark. (C) Kov/elk and Katar Stocks. Dhows and Buildings. Monsieur Leroy asked whether claims under these heads were to be considered. They were informed that it was not proposed to purchase Dhows or buildings which remained the property of the Goguyer family and that the negotiations were limited to Muscat stocks. Compensation for loss of trade must be held to cover allall claims other than for Muscat stocks. Monsieur Leroy declared after the interview that the result of the negotiations was 'une grave deception*XXIII. November 14th. Monsieur T., Dieu's cia-ima (l) PggM pment to J-ihn-M In r8ply tc a question Monsieur Dleu stated that the arms reshipped from Muscat to Jibuti were not In cluded in the Muscat Inventory. They were reshipped on ay 15th last, while the Inventory was drawn up and certified by the two Consuls In August last. (2) Muscat Stock-R Monsieur Dieu's tabulated claim for 'divers' (see XIX (2) (a)) amounted to Frs. 4839, Frs. 400 more than his previous claim under this head. This was point ed out to him. Worked out at the agreed rates It amounted to Frs. 4701 . The totals of the Muscat stocks and rates were then read over to Monsieur Dieu and noted by him. (3) Comoensatlon for los s of Trade . Observations were made to Monsieur Dleu on the Memorandum left by him on November 12th (see XXI (3)). It was pointed out that His Majesty's Government did not admit any absolute right to a claim against them either for the stocks at Muscat or for loss of trade. Any proposals made were for a settlement as a pure act of grace. MonsieurMonsieur Dieu had submitted a statement of his sales and profits for the three years from September 1909 to August 191?. It showed a total profit of Frs. 510,051, and an average of Frs. 170,017 (£6,800). He asked by what multiple it was proposed to calculate his compensation. He was informed that 1 would be the multiple. He protested that this produced less than the difference between the inventory values cer tified by the British and French Consuls at Muscat,and urged that the least that ought to have been offered him was the valuation of the British Consul as he had set forth in his Memorandum. He was told that His ^ Majesty^ Government were in no way bound by the valuation in question which had been submitted with all reservations, and that it was not proposed to re open the question of the Muscat stocks. He was asked what he considered a fair multiple. Monsieur Gieu said it was not for him a question of sale but 0 f ex propriation and that it was usual in cases of expropria tion to take a multiple which would provide a capital to produce the average profit at l^o namely a multiple of 61, or a compensation of £44,200. It was pointed out that compensation on such a scale could not be re commendedrecommended t»o Ills njesljy's Qovernmen't and lie was in vited to name a more reasonable multiple. A multiple of 2 was finally offered him. Monsieur Dieu said he would not accept a less multiple than 5; he would rather request the French Ministry for Foreign Af fairs to telegraph to the French Consul to remove his seals from the stocks and allow him to continue his business. No further progress was made.XXIV. Novsmber 15th. MrsBers. Goguver'a Claim . (1) In the absence of Monsieur Leopold Rlbaz Monsieur Leroy brought with him Monsieur Auguste Goguyer, one of the heirs. (2) Muscat Stock's . Monsieur Leroy was informed that a few arms not priced in the Muscat Inventory had been omitted from the agreement regarding stocks. Taken at the same rates they amounted to a total of Prs. 5428. The total results of the percentages on the agreed formula were then read and checked by Monsieur Leroy. It was found that he had calculated these by a compound percentage producing 4 V too much in the grand total. He admitted this and noted the correct totals amounting to Prs. 675,000, £27,000. (3) Comoensat1 on for Loss of Trade . Monsieur Leroy said no reply had yet been re ceived from Muscat to establish his annual shipments but he estimated his annual profit at the lowest possible computation at £10,000, and asked for three years profit.

Monsieur Leroy stated that it was 'yes” hut.... Colonel Tisdall informed him that if it was 'yes' I he was not interested to hear 'buts', and the negotia tions with Messrs. Goguysr's representatives were closed after the full total amount for their Muscat stocks and for Compensation for loss of trade had been checked and noted: £37,000.

Asked to give his reply to the above mentioned offer onsie^r Leroy produced a type-written proposal for a compromise between one and three years profit, which was not accepted by Mr. Pamsay. It was agreed y that Monsieur Elbaz should call o^ Monday 17th and ' reply by yes or no. Monsieur Elbaz enquired how long It would take for His Majesty's Government to consider the proposed settlement. Monsieur Leroy was asked, to supply some documen tary evidence of Messrs.

(l) Compensation for loss of Trade . Monsieur Dieu was asked whether he had considered the offer of ‘two years' profits as compensation for his loss of trade and whether he had decided tc ac - cept or decline. Monsieur Dieu said he had considered it but he wished to make an explanation which he felt sure would cause Colonel Tlsdall to reconsider his final offer. He then stated that the compensation offered did not cover the losses he would have to sustain ove^ the orders he had actually placed with European makers. These amounted to Frs. 700,000 (£ 28 ,Oon). Monsieur Dieu pointed out that if he had not, as an act of prudence, stopped the shipment of these arms and am munition to Muscat, the inventory drawn up there would have shown a stock of Frs. 915,800 (£36,632) and his compensationcompensation for stocks would have been proportionally Increased. Asked if he could produce documentary proof of the contracts in question. Monsieur Dieu gave his word of honour that he could do so. it was put to Monsieur Dieu that the firms in question might take over the arms ordered. Monsieur Dieu replied that the arms were packed and had been awaiting shipment for some 12 months and the firms were demanding accep tance and payment. He said they were specially made for the ' useat market and were not saleable elsewhere. Monsieur Dieu appealed to Colonel Tisdall's sense of equity that three years’ profit should at least be granted. Colonel Tjsdall said that he could not Jus tify mere than two years' profit In his recommenda tion to Fis Majesty's Government and that was a more liberal settlement than had been granted to the other firm. His Justification for that difference of treatment was that he had recognized that, while the other firm in question was a declining business, Monsieur Dieu possessed a prosperous and rising business. Monsieur Dieu insisted that if he agreed to accept two year's profits he would not be able to cover his obligations and asked what was to be done regarding&amp; regard in, l,i s reshlpment to Jibuti amounting to ap- proximately *5,400 (.n.r.ardp »ort e d out at aoc.ptod rat8S t0 1,0 !

Tisdall informing me that a provisional agreement has be reached with M. Louis Dieu and the representatives of Messrs. Goguyer in regard to their stocks of arms and ammunition at Muscat. Colonel Tisdall requests that he may receive instructions with regard to a reshipment of arms, the property of M. Dieu, from Muscat to Jibuti and to certain stocks belonging to Messrs.

(No. 2.) Pans, November 13, 1913. I HAVE the honour to inform you that a provisional agreement has been arrived at with M. Louis Dieu and the representatives of Messrs. Goguyer as regards their stocks of arms and ammunition at Muscat, amounting to:— M. Dieu Messrs. Gioguyer Total £ 8,632 27,000 35,632 These totals were arrived at by estimating the value of the stocks given in the Muscat inventory at free-on-board values in Europe, instead of accepting the invoice values shown in that document. The invoice values in the case of M. Dieu were evidently loaded and 20 per cent, was deducted. In the case of Messrs. Goguyer it was contended that invoice values were the same as free-on-board values, but eventually 10 per cent, deduction was accepted. To these free-on-board values was added 2J- per cent, for freight and insurance, 6 per cent, for customs and landing expenses, 3 per cent, for agent’s commission, and 30 per cent, for profit. Each of these percentages were strongly contested. M. Dieu claimed 5'8 per cent, for freight and insurance, 10'5 per cent, for customs, 10'2 per cent, for agent’s commission, and 14*4 per cent, for profit. Messrs. Goguyer claimed 2J per cent, for freight and insurance, 8 per cent, for customs, 5’4 per cent, for agent’s commission, and 34*02 per cent, for profit. At these rates M. Dieu’s claim was virtually for the proprietor’s valuations in the Muscat inventory, while Messrs. Goguyer’s claims was based on the invoice values in the inventory, plus 50 per cent, for charges and profits. M. Dieu only gave his assent provisionally, remarking that it depended on the amount of compensation to be awarded to him for loss of trade whether he definitely accepted the proposed figures. I have received from M. Louis Dieu and Messrs. Goguyer the following claims which do not fall within the scope of my instructions:— M. Dieu claims 10,093Z.

I HAVE the honour to acquaint you that it was decided at an unofficial interview with M.

Louis Dieu and Goguyer and Company, in respect of their claims for compensation for the cessation of their trade at Muscat, should commence at the Embassy the following day. It was arranged that the representatives of the two Erench firms should be interviewed separately. M. Hieu presented a copy of the inventory of the arms and ammunition, his property at Muscat, which was in substantial agreement with that contained in Major 8 . G. Knox’s despatch to Sir Edward Grey, No. 163, Confidential, of the 2 nd September last. He also put forward the following additional claims:— 1. Compensation for a stock of arms and ammunition valued at 10,000/. which had been consigned to Muscat and reconsigned to Jibuti owing to the operation of the new regulations at Muscat. 2. Compensation for arms to the value of 2,900/. alleged to be ordered and awaiting shipment in the hands of British and German firms. I informed M. Hieu that claims under these two heads must be deferred until an agreement had been reached with regard to the Muscat stocks. 3. Consideration of a claim of Messrs. Kynoch against M. Hieu for non-acceptance of delivery of one and a-half million rounds of -303 ammunition held ready on a ‘‘tacit understanding” (i.e., not expressly ordered). I told M. Hieu that such a claim could not be entertained. M. Hieu raised the question of compensation for loss of trade. He was informed that this matter would be considered after agreement had been arrived at respecting his stocks at Muscat. I invited him to present his claim for these in a form giving details of price “free-on-board,” freight and insurance, customs dues, Muscat agent’s commission, and nett profit. M. Goguyer’s representatives, M. Leopold Elbaz and M. Georges Leroy, who spoke for him, produced a copy of the inventory of that firm’s property at Muscat in substantial agreement with that enclosed in Major Knox’s despatch above referred to. 7' [1936 h — 1 ]M. Leroy stated that besides a claim for loss of business, there was a question respecting two buildings at Muscat valued at 2,640/., four dhows valued at 720/., and certain debts due from native traders alleged to be irrecoverable on cessation of business. I informed M. Leroy that these matters would be dealt with when discussing the question of compensation for loss of trade, but that the claim for stocks ^ at Muscat must first be considered.

NOW that the question of compensating firms engaged in the Muscat trade in arms and ammunition has become an admitted obligation on the part of the British G-overnment, having regard to the stoppage of the trade by it, we beg to put forward our claim for compensation. As you are aware, we have for the past twenty-five years been carrying on the business perfectly openly and in accordance with the regulations enforced from time to time, and under a special permit from the Sultan of Muscat. The permits at present in force were for a period of six years from the 9 th September, 1908, and consequently had more than two years to run from the date of the stoppage of the trade. Our claim in respect of the rifles and ammunition which were seized by the authorities at the time of the seizure of the whole of the stocks in Muscat has already had your consideration, and in a letter dated the 18th July, 1913, you dealt with our claim by informing us that there was a buyer for the goods if we were prepared to take an additional moderate profit by way of further compensation in respect of these goods, and as we have expressed our willingness to do so, and the matter will doubtless be dealt with on these lines, our claim in respect of these goods will be made in due course. The stoppage of the trade has caused us immense losses in various directions, and a perusal of the details of the claim we now forward will show you that it covers goods finished and in process of manufacture in order to complete existing contracts with merchants in Muscat; compensation for machinery, tools, and premises rendered useless ; compensation for loss of business ; and various other items of expenses, &amp;c. It further includes an item of 3,500/. which we are liable to pay to Messrs. Kynoch in respect of goods in process of manufacture by them on our behalf for this market. Any further information with regard to the various items, or evidence with regard to them, we shall be happy to produce. Of course if you are prepared to deal with the finished goods and goods in course of manufacture in the same way as you propose to deal with the goods belonging to us which have been seized and which have been referred to above, by selling them on our behalf within a reasonable time, on terms satisfactory to us, we shall be happy to withdraw our claim in respect of these.

Foreign Office to Treasury gj r Foreign Office, October 11, 1913. WITH reference to your letter No. 519 of the 14th January last, respecting the question of the payment of compensation to French traders in the event of its provino- possible to come to arrangement with the French Government for prohibiting the arms traffic at Muscat, I am directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to state for the information of the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury that negotiations on the subject have been nroceeding throughout the summer, and that it is hoped that an arrangement may be made on the following lines The French Government will, if His Majesty’s Government can themselves settle with the trade interests involved, recognise the'regulations now in force at Muscat, and the ri°*bt of the Sultan to amend these regulations with the concurrence of His Majesty’s Government. The French Government will not, however, themselves take part in any negotiations with the traders, but will leave this part of the question to be settled by a representative of His Majesty’s Government negotiating directly with the persons interested. With this object in view it has been arranged that an expert shall visit Paris, with a view to coming to an agreement with the arms dealers as to the sum which His Majesty’s Government should pay them as compensation for the losses they may have sustained in consequence of the establishment of the arms warehouse m re g r ets that it has not been possible, in spite of prolonged negotiations, to induce the French Government to agree to any arrangement for terminating the treaty riadits of French citizens which would be less expensive than that indicated above It must, however, be remembered that the cessation of the trade at Muscat will permit of a large annual saving on the amount at present spent on the naval blockade in the Persian Gulf, as it is confidently anticipated that under the warehouse reo-ulations it will in future be possible to establish a complete control at Muscat over any consignments which may be imported into that place from European ports. The Lords Commissioners will no doubt share Sir E. Grey’s view that it is of great importance that the opportunity of suppressing this traffic, which has lor so many years been a source of constant trouble and expense to the Government of India, as well as the cause of considerable friction between the French Government and His Majesty’s Government, should not be lost. Sir E. Grey trusts, therefore, that their Lordships will approve of the course which has been adopted, and that they will be ready to accept as a charge on Imperial funds half the expenditure which may be involved. , T . , Any arrangement made by Colonel Tisdall will of course be ad referendum.

The question asked is:- 'talcing assessed value f.o.b. as a basis,, what is a fail- Muscat value of compensation for surrender of anas and ajimunition'; and It is suggested that this value should be on assessed value f.o.b. for freight end insurance and Muscat port charges, 10/5 for Muscat agent's co nmlseion, and 2Q' for sliippers’ profit, tialcing a total of 35/5 on assessed value f.o.b.* Being debarred from enquiring from the trade conceraing this matter I liave had to obtain from other sources the necessary data to check the above figures. (1) I understand that although the business in question is transacted in France, the rifles, etc. are si lipped cliiafly from Belgitaa. From the Belgian official returns I find that the exports from Belgium to Arabia in 1312 were as follows:- Military rifles, 53,780 kilos valued at fee.225.000 Sporting Rifles, 26,996 ' * ' * 132.970Slvon separately in the Belgian returns, but in the United Kingdom returns the exports of t’- mt Anas Ammunition (milltaiy) to Arabia-Huscat are stated to hfva been in 1912, 1,757, cwts., valued at £4,150.

These are equal to 3iZ on No. 1 4i/ on No. 2 \ ; 'T and 13C' on No. 3. An average of would seem to toe very literal. (2) Ab regard b the Muscat agent’s commission of KjT) tills (If the rate Is correct) would presumably have to be paid on any rifles that had actually been Imported and were unsold, but It can hardly apply to rifles not yet shipped, unless the exporters have an agreement with the agent to ship a certain number of r: fles each year, which is hardly likely. The commission agent will of course lose the businoss, | and it is a question whether he Is entitled to com- \ pensation on that account. If compensation for cornraission Is to be allowed 10 per cent does not seem to be too much, but it is suggested that it Should be made clear that the merchant to whom the compensation Is paid snail satisfy any claim on the part of the 1 us cat Agent. There is an Import duty of 3f?S ad valorem, which would presumably have to be taken into consideration for rifles upon which duty has been paid but which remain unsold.

Ae regards goodwill the question put v.'as: - •TOiut are the general terras on wliich the good will Is assessed when a flourishing business changes hands?

Messrs. Munro and Morton, Accountants, of Lawrence Lane, E.C. who I understand have had con siderable experience in this class of business, state that the terras vary very considerably according to the circumstances attending each case. Under ordinary circumstances if a f lourlsM ng business entirely changed hands, 3 years' profits would not be out of the my but 5 might be very liberal. hrIn any iurther communica tion on this subject, please quote and address— y The Under-Secretary of State, ‘ Foreign Office, London.

From Major S. G. Knox, C.I.E., Political Agent and His Britannic Maiesty's Consul, Maskat, J J T° Lieutenant-Colonel Sin P. Z. Cox, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Political Resident and His Britannic Majesty^s Consul-General in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. In continuation of my letter* No. 142, dated the 10th August 1913, to * f ide Serial No. 230. your address, I have the honour to forward herewith a further statement showing the second portion of the inventory, namely, that portion which concerns itself with the property of Messrs. Goguyer &amp; Co. (Maskat local agent, Brahim Elbaz). 2. In my view, the main objection to this portion of the inventory is the large number of old and practically unsaleable weapons which figure therein. Many of these, one would think, date from the original establishment of Messrs. Goguyer &amp; Co.^ in Maskat. Some very large items, as for example the caps and the cartridges for shooting canes and the 12-bore shot cartridges, do not come within the scope of the Warehouse regulations, and I do not consider that Messrs. Goguyer &amp; Co. are entitled to compensation thereon. 3. I also enclose a statement showing the arms and ammunition lying unclaimed in the State Warehouse, and believed to be the property of French merchants. The Superintendent of the Warehouse and the French merchants have compared their respective books in the presence of myself and the French Consul, and their figures agree, but the goods themselves have not yet been examined. It is, however, unlikely that these goods will have been tampered with. Further, the rough estimated cost given has been prepared in my office, and the French merchants' prices will no doubt be very considerably higher. 4. Thus the total figures, according to the French merchants, give a rough estimate of £ 62,179, and, according to our figures, £ 52,517 of all arms consi dered up to date.

These arms have not yet arrived, but Monsieur Elbaz has assured my colleague and myself that he is doing his best to bring them here.

Louis Dieu (Maskat local agent Andre Menasche). 2. I give the prices named both by the proprietor and by Inspector Hazrat Shah with all reserve, and I consider that the Erench especially have enormously ovei valued the stocks left to them. I will give one instance only. This morning I took the opportunity of an interview with His Highness to ask him if he had any explanation to offer in reply to the query contained in x Serial No. 198. the last paragraph of Foreign Department ,, _ , telegramJ No. 282 S. to the address of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. His Highness replied that he was aware that Ali Khan had ordered for him 400 Martini-Henry rifles and five lakhs rounds of Martini-Henry ammunition. His Highness showed me the terms of the contract. The goods were to be supplied by the Societe Frangaise des Munitions, and the prices were named therein : Rs. 25 per rifle and Rs. 60 per 1,000 rounds ammunition. A comparison of these with the prices, invoice value Rs. 45 and Pr. 90, and Rs. 65 and Rs. 150 Maskat value according to proprietor, will show that Menasche is trying to get cent, per cent, and even more profit in some cases on Maskat prices. In fact, as I pointed out to him, while he is, on the one hand, complaining loudly against the Warehouse and demanding compensation, he is at the same time hoisting his prices to and above the famine prices caused by the establishment of the very Warehouse of which he complains. The fact is that the past twelve months have been, as the French Consul admitted to me in conversation, a practical monopoly for the French traders, and they have been enabled to get rid of large quantities of what was practically scrap-iron at ridiculous prices. 3. The details of the statement call for little further remark. There is a “ Mitrailleuse ” unpriced. It must have been brought here as a curiosity and did not find a purchaser. I see no reason why compensation should be allowed' for it. Similarly, there are ten thousand buck-shot cartridges which I was inclined to rule out, as the Warehouse does not concern itself with shot cartridges. Monsieur Menasche argued that the breaking up of his business made it impossible for him to sell the buck-shot cartridges alone, to which I replied that, by a simple extension of this argument, the French might put in claims for bags of rice and dates on the plea that such merchandise were merely a side-issue with them, and would not provide them with a living were it not for their trade in arms and ammunition. 4. In conclusion, I would point out that, in round figures, £ 10,000 represents the total value, according to his own prices, of Monsieur Menasche’s stocks in the whole of Oman territory, exclusive of those actually detained in the State Warehouse. In my opinion, Inspector Hazrat Shah’s estimate, in round figures £ 7,500, errs on the side of liberality. 5.

WITH reference to your letter of the 14th ultimo, respecting the possible payment of compensation by His Majesty’s Government in connection with the suppression ot Ihe arms traffic at Muscat, I am directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to transmit to vou herewith, for the information of the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty s Treasury, copy of correspondence on the subject which has been received Horn the Sir E. Grey concurs in the view taken hy the India Office and the Government of India, that the French Government would not he likely to regard as smta e compensation the payment of a sum calculated to represent the reasonable profit the traders on the value of their goods. It is, however, not proposed that His Majesty’s Government should he the first to raise the question of compensate , fnl K Grey h of opinion that it will be desirable to await the reply of the French Govci'nnient to^the°proposaIs now under their consideration, in order to see to what ecterit 1 cempensatioif 1 will he claimed. As soon as the French claim has been put forward it will be possible to consider whether it m any way furnishes a reasonable basis for discussion, and, if the question of compensation is touched upon, wiiat .should ^ been admitted that the Muscat traders have unobtainable. j am W.

Your telegram of 29tli January. Maskat compensation. We doubt whether French would accept compensation to limited extent suggested if principle of compensation were once admitted. If compensation suggested were offered it should be as a compromise or act of grace and not as of right. As regards profits, Knox reports that they are not very large. A great distinction must be drawn between, class (a) European traders sending goods to Arab buyers at Maskat ; class ( 6 ) European traders having- local agents out here to push wares, such as Louis Dieu ; class (c) Persian and Arab middlemen. Some time ago Neauber informed Knox that profits of European houses,—class (a)—were mere ordinary commercial profit, say 10 per cent. As regards class Y) risks are great and profits laige, about 25 per cent., but many of these dealers would not appear on compensation lists. Class ( 6 ) holds position midway between class (a) and (c).expenditure on this object. I an accordingly to en quire whether the purpose 3ir E. Grey has in view could not he secured by an undertaking that, if the traders will take back these rifles &amp;c. from Muscat. they shall receive a payment calculated to represent a reasonable profit on the value of their roods. This scheme. My Lords conceive, would not necessitate the heavy expenditure involved by that suggested in the letter under reply and would at the same time meet quite adequately the claim, such as it is, for com pensation put forward on behalf of the traders.

Please see your telegram No. 1426, dated the 12th instant. I see no objection in principle to the suggested compensation if convenient, but it would not be easy in practice to distinguish between genuine and bogus claims for compensation and to ascertain exact balance stock of ammunition and arms remaining with the French traders. As regards others who are bound by regu lations, I presume that claims will not be considered except for stock of arms and ammunition deposited in the warehouses. In that case on September 1st rifles belonging to the French detained at warehouse number 230 ; rounds of ammunition four lakhs. The stock belonging to others deposited in the ware house and remaining unsold is as follows :—rounds of ammunition three and a quarter lakhs, rifles 4,000. Outside warehouse the French stock of arms and ammunition in their Maskat godowns is I estimate 8,000 rifles with 200 car tridges apiece. Take half the amount last quoted as the French stocks elsewhere in Oman.

(Repeated to Bushire and Maskat.) Foreign Secret, Maskat Arms Traffic. French Consul has asked Sultan for permission for Menachi, French arms dealer, to ship portion of arms and ammunition now in warehouse to Europe or Jibuti, without prejudice to Menachi’s claim for compensation. We see no objection to reshipment of arms, and Sultan would be glad to be rid of them. But question of customs duty arises. As there is nothing in French Treaty to justify exemption, and as warehouse is not bonded warehouse for customs purposes, but storehouse for regulation of arms, trade-duty should be claimed. This will make clear character of warehouse. As regards compensation, Sultan might reply that he has never admitted any claim for compensation, and can say nothing on the subject. % i l qa /i 3 ■ From Secretary of State to Viceroy, Foreiyn Department, 21st January 1913.
