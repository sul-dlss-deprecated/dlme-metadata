Koweit: Release of Political Prisoners by the Sheikh, The Political Resident* s telegram 1013 below reports the unconditional release of all political prisoners by the Sheikh. It is not clear whether this is connected with a request which H.M.G. recently received from Ibn Sand to lend their offices with the Sheikh in securing the release of certain persons imprisoned by the Sheikh in connection with the agitation in 1938, which resulted in the setting up of a more or less self-appointed advisory council to the Sheikh,and subsequent disturbances in 1939 (see papers at Ext. 365/44)- At any rate the Sheikh apparently now feels his position to be securer, which is all to the good so far as are concerned. ^ ^ ^ u i r 3(r (22229) VVt.25796/P.U3 5,000 9/42 A.&amp; E.W.Ltd.

We agree with the Political Resident* s view that this is not a matter in which it would be desirable for H.M.G-. to intervene with the Sheikh of Koweit. If you agree, perhaps the best line to take in replying to Ibn Baud might be simply to say that H.M.G. feel that the appropriate course would be for him to approach the Sheikh direct, if he wishes to take the matter up, Yours sincerely, (Sgd.)

The persons named by Ibn Saud appear to have been involved in the agitation against the Sheikh of Koweit in 1938, which resulted in the setting up of a more or less self-appointed Advisory Council to the Sheikh. (For history of this agitation please see the minutes at P.Z.7323/38 and, for a detailed account, the Political Resident's letter at P.Z.536^/38). It is difficult to identify them for certain, but it seems that some of the individuals are identical with members of the Advisory Council of fourteen; (compare the list given in / Koweit Intelligence Summary No. 12 of 1938, paragraph 90^ We ha?t not, however, heard that any of these persons had since been imprisoned by the Sheikh. The line suggested by the Political Resident seems correct, and a draft letter to the Foreign Office supporting it is submitted accordingly. *&lt;!&lt;&lt;r ~:0 P'L no i &lt;*8 u&gt;\ ITi V - ' JS&amp; iL 365 SisURM 2838 944 INWARD TELE GRALl *^ k ,m &gt;^»i i—» i m *M .ti — (II in ar^y case the communication of .of this document to any person outside Gorernment Service is authorised, it must he paraphrased)* Allotted to ICxte rriaX Department^ OopTes Circulated^ ^ ^ C Y P SR TEL # G R A M run From Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.

My dear Colonel, Will you please refer to paragraph No. 127 of this Agency Diary No. 21 of 1940. t a* »» ft « v t l a. I felt that there was something peculiar about the Shaikh's behaviour when I informed him of the proposed visit of the Armoured Cars. To my statement he replied that Kuwait belonged to Kis Majesty's Government etc, etc, but later he asked if the cars were coming on their usual visit, as much as to «sk if this were an extra one. I replied saying that there wao no such thing as a usual visit, and the conversation turned to something else- later he asked me if they going to stay permanently, to which I replied 'no' and asked him why he should &gt;=sk such a question. He gave some evasive reply. It strikes me as very odd that he should have asked such a question, and I cannot imagine why he did so. 3. The Armoured Cars gave a demonstration one day of car section drill in co-operation with aircraft, and I asked the Shaikh to turn out his vanette drivers to watch. He did not do this, and turned out as few other people as he could, I thought. Certainly he told the Shaikhs present not to accept lifts in the aeroplanes. 4. As there * has been no sloop’s visit since May, 1339, and it is possible that some people here may be inclined to trunk that his Majesty's Government are too much occupied elsewhere to worry about Kuwait, I thought it would be a good thing if the cars were not kept out of the Town as they usually are, and so asked the Section leader to parade the cars in the Saffat one day. large numbers of people came to stare at them, and I neard the appreciative remark that all were Rolls-Royces, and of tne very best make.

Will you please refer to paragraph 94(i) of the Kuwait Intelligence Summary Ho. 14 of 1940. 2. It is now almost two months since the Majlis has met. There has been much conflicting gossip in the town, but there is no doubt that the iimaediate cause of the cessation of meetings was the inspection of Shaikh Pahad as Salim’s accounts during his absence in Bahrain. When Bahad returned to Kuwait he made a great fuss, said his honour had been impunged and quarrelled violently with Shaikh Yusuf bin Isa, Khalid as Zaid and Thaniyan al Ghanim, the three non-Subah members of t'k© Majlis who had taken part in the inspection of the accounts. This quarrel is unlikely to be forgotten in the near future since Pahad spat in the faces of the latter two members. 3. The As Subah are divided amongst themselves and some of of them do not support Pahad. The position is further complicated by Shaikh Abdulla Salim and his party being anxious to oust Shaikh Ali al Khalifah - a man of great character and His Highness* strongest supporter - from the position of 'Director of Law /and2 © and Order ••• 4. It has heen reported that His Highness is very pleased that the members of the Majlis have quarrelled among themselves. This is quite probably true as the various forms of Majlis have given him so much trouble during the last two years. There is little doubt that Shaikh Ahmad has made no attempt to persuade the Majlis to resume its meetings. 5. While I was talking to His Highness yesterday about education in Kuwait he referred to the Maj lis and I mentioned casually that I had heard it had not met for two months. His expression and manner changed completely as if the subject was most distasteful and he said rather hastily that the weather had been hot and most of the members had been absent from Kuwait. I immediately dropped the subject but the reference to the Majlis had evidently upset the Shaikh as he seemed ill at ease for the rest of the interview. There is not a shadow of doubt that the reasons given by Kis Highness for the cessation of the meetings are not the correct ones. 6. Shaikh Abdulla Salim returned from a short visit to Baghdad two days ago and it is said that something will soon be done to end the impasse. It is important to remember that the administration is going on as /usualZ.5457/40 SECRET (X Extract from Kuwait Intelligence Summary for period 16th to 31st August, 1910. No. 16. 94.

The Majlis which normally sits twice a week has not had a proper meeting for the last three weeks, and this is attributed to ill-feeling, resulting from the investigation of the Treasury accounts. It now appears that Shaikh Fahad was never formally appointed Treasurer and that he took charge of the accounts at the suggestion of his elder brother Shaikh Abdulla as Salim.

My dear Colonel Since the beginning of the v/ar i have been sending brief situation reports, which i will now amplify by consider ing each main section of the community separately* Anti- British feelings are part and parcel of anti-Subah feelings and possibly are only pro-German as that is a popular method of expressing dissatisfaction with the present order# 2. The Subah family. His Highness, I believe, at the | outoreak of war was only half-hearted in his support of Britain* The reasons for this were old grudges and resent ment at the support lent to the revolutionaries which resulted in the internal troubles of 1938-39. he showed his hand by his failure to act vigorously in a number of *vays, but 1 think it is safe to say that his attitude has I changed, and that he will now do what he can to help, provided it does not touch his pocket. The very evident signs of nervousness which he used to display at some calamity in Europe no longer recur, and he has steadied down to uxie prospect that he must either sink or swim with us. i don't think that his attitude can be estimated higher tnan that, but he is cheerful and fully aware of the amount of the anti-British-Subah feeling in the town. I think tnis sums up the attitude of the remainder of the Subah family, including the Abdulla Salim faction. 3. The Sunni Arab merchants. Sdme people say that 75/6 of' tnese merchants look upon British activities with disfavour but this is an exaggeration; 50% is nearer the mark.

They add to this the British attitude in Palestine and also our action, as they believe it to have been, in conmitting a volte face over the first Maj lis , and leaving them in the lurch, it rnay be that Herr Hitler is admired for his methods, for some of the merchants are not over- scrupulous themselves. The ring leaders of this party are aoout six in number, and they openly express their sentiments. The remainder are quiet enough, but together they form an influential party and are virtually the party which seized power in 1938. During that time they showed no respect for established institutions. 4® Tne Shiahs. This section of the Kuwait community forms more than half of the total population and is composed of merchants of Persian, Bahraini and Iraqi extraction, and also O- tne labouiing classes. On the whole they are well disposed to tne present regime, but despite their numbers, unfortunately, have not the influence of the Sunnis. 5. This brief summary discloses the state of affairs, and it will oe seen that there is only one just cause for ill feel ing towards us and that is the weakness of the Subah administra tion. I have received many hints, andopen requests from some : merchants, for the appointment of an Adviser and such an appoint- | mQnt is the onl y way to remove this ill feeling, i have men- tioned this question of an Adviser elsewhere, and need say no i.;ore here, except to add that our prestige and influence must be carefully guarded, if necessary by the expenditure of money. When His Highness had signed the Kuwait Sulphur Agreement and was subsiding into the sofa l, who was signing, heard him sigh quietly to himself M Thank God, an American Company at last”.

The Shaikh of Dubai has been pressing his demands on the Shaikh of Sharjah to turn the Auwlad Rashid out of his town and also to force the Shaikh of Hira to turn the Auwlad Bati out of Hira. After a good deal ol talk the Auwlad Rashid, with the exception of Shaikh Mana’s family, moved to Hira and this was followed by an agreement between the Shaikhs of Dubai and Sharjah to 'boycott” Hira until both the Rashid and Bati families are forced to leave. The Shaikh of Sharjah has always claimed that Hira is under his suzerainty but is far too pusillanimous in character and weak in armed strength to enforce this claim. Although the agreement between the Shaikhs of Dubai and Sharjah has resulted in the road between the two towns being reopened to traffic and in a general easing of tension, it is highly improbable that it will have any effect on the Shaikh of Hira’s expressed determination to keep the Rashid and Bati families in his town.1 I 58 i JooX idtritlaq D.O.Bo. i/XOC, Ofiia* of tilt retU#nt in tht ^ *jctl4^miX£»—/ ^t«a tht XXth tbrua*y # X^40# wy dtar Jflurtt f *«fore X Xtft Kuwait in )to«mbtr x toX4 the h&amp;ikh that 1 thought that one of tht reason® why h* had not received the supiort from hit fai ily that he was entitled to expect was that he had been somewhat uig^erdly with the allowa^cee which he made to the^, and pointed out that shaikh Haisad of iaiiraln had always o«*?n very aareful to have hie family four square behind him by ^eans of subsidies whi^fe, if anything, have been on the generous side• 2* X was very glad to bear frew Galloway recently that fee had increased the allowaiioes of the 1 b«bah fey 40 and 501 and in certain oases by as much as 350 &gt;♦ hie will 1 think, have a very good effect, ;or, as arrett observed raan^ ye re agt», the .tiling families of these states regard their irinoipalitles as properties which they won with the sword and expect to fee shared in coaecn, and if the uler does not give an adequate eiiare of the swag to sewfeers of his lazily he is certain to meet trouble *o«*i#r or later, usually sooner* X a si sending copies of th: s letter to ieel and oalloway« Yours sincerely sd* C.G.Prior# 0*f*Garo« suuirs, 3sCVStary to the Government of India, External Affairs Jepartweat, Ksw Delhi* *sent under irinted letter ho*a/X01 of 11th Ft binary 1^40*-7 / 779 j 1939 of the iQlltioaX ^eeident in theiersian Ouil # D*^*Ko*C/833# X«T«Ktarohus 9 at Dfbal* lat«d the Slid moewber, XS 39 • 11XX you pXoaao roier to my de^i-ofiiuiaX letter Ko.y?x3 f dated the 12th Korewber X930 t regarding the Shaikh of Kuwait t After further experience of Kuwait and the simpler i&amp;odea of epee eh and oere^ony prevailing there, I do not now ooneider that the m&amp;mie. in whiuh the shaikh alluded to my predecessor was deliberately intended to be rude, and the incident may be oeneldered oXoee&lt;t w in this part of the world Arab customs are unaffected by contact with the out* side world and there is nothing unusual in alruaiug to a dletlnguiehed person elaply by his n*we without any of the ccmplimeiitary apostrophes that are in rogue elseehere* As regards de Gaury, howerer, there is no doubt tir t the shaikh*s feelings ran away with him. 2« the mstmicrv of the Shaikh of Kuwait are, hewer^r, or hare been allowed to become decidedly lax, as the follow* l»g incident will shear, At the Id, the Ahaiih sent a message to Galloway shortly before his visit to say that it wnuld be ,l ras«ii , *, in oth*r words th ;t he expected hi® to appear in uniform, as 1 kuppsr«td to be in Kuwait it would hare been rude to hare paid no visit at the Id, and as the iolitical Agent was going in uniform 1 went in unifons too.

There is no doubt that he entertains the bitterest feelings for Captain de Oaury. and tnat nothing will make him ohange them.

On reading this file I think we can hardly he surprised if the Shaikh cherishes an animus against Powle and de Gaury. You may care to refer to the papers I have flagged and sidelined. Incidentally I have observed only one reference to Colonel Dickson which you will find at P.Z.4401/38. The Shaikh obviously detested any idea of a Council and considered that in supporting it Powle and de Gaury were playing into the hands of 'the enemy'. He doubtless sees the course of events as follows: V/e make a fuss about the flogging of A1 Bafcrak long before the Iraqi Press takes it up ( P.Z.2715/38) V/e father the idea of a council (P.Z.4401/38) This advice leaks out ( P.Z.5364/38) A council is suddenly set up in which 'the Shaikh is a cypher'. This goes much farther than we had intended or suggested but nevertheless we support it as though it was what we had always approved (P.Z.5035/38)[V&gt;k t ( ^. 7511 ^ U it*. ~| Trouble then starts. First the Sheikh’s secretary/2 . Secretary is threatened hy the hew Council. We attempt a compromise (I’owle was for refusing the Shaikh any support^ on this issue Z.5661/38), hut finally, in view of^danger of^Secretary’s being stoned de Gaury urges that we. should leave. He goes. (p.Z. 6062/38) Then comes the Sunni-Shi^at controversy. (P.Z.7317/38) Finally the Shaikh overturns the Council and sets up a new one (P.Z.214/39) over which he has the right of veto. We accept this state of affairs after doing what was possible in the way of arbitration. ’’That accursed Council has taught us a useful lesson”' is the Shaikh’s final comment on the affair.\ yh (V ^yjto RLE COPY LuO'J I j cs) i ; ,Jlotted to Political PQ-partmen Copy to .Mr, Y/^lton ( 51 groups) ,o^q J l J SECRET, PepartmenTT 4582.

Internal Affairs. 'ft w Local intelligent observers believe that the political barometer in Kuwait is now set ’fair'. One of them went so far as to say that it will remain 'fair' for^about fifteen years”.’ It has to be remembered that incidents such as that on March 10th, reported in the last summary, were most unusual in Kuwait, and that the effect has thus been correspondingly great. Those who leant politically towards the agitators have now confessed they did so because they thought that they were the winning side; such is the unsettling effect of persistent and intensive propaganda on simple minds. The internal troubles in Iraq, straight news from the B.B.C. and other causes, but mostly the firm action forced upon the local authorities by events, have put things right again. The Subah family hold (unpaid, being sufficiently well off without pay) most of the important official posts and are represented in the new Council, which is so far functioning happily, and is of the kind v/hich is usual in Arabia, a Committee of experienced Elders. As the Administrative report of this Agency may not reach recipients of this report, who, owing to Iraq propaganda against Kuwait, may be interested to know the truth, a very brief summary of some administrative matters is included below:- Council . There is an Advisory Council of 13 members, nine are notables, four are members of the Ruling clan, in addition there is a Resident, the Shaikh’s cousin. The Shaikh himself sits with the Council frequently, is the executive power, and has a right of veto, which, so far, he has not used. Financial . The Revenue of the State is at the disposal of the Council and goes to its Treasury. Medical . There is a Mission Hospital which maintains 20 beds for/for men and 20 'beds for women, theatre. 3. hach section has an operating There is a Government of India Free Dispensary. The'-e is a free dispensary maintained by a rich notable, Ahmad al Ghanim. ji nev ' / Kuwait State ’Cottage Hospital’ is being started as soon as possible and plans are under way at the present time. The agency sends the Quarantine Medical Officer with free supplies ox the simpler safe medicines to the village on Falaicha Island annually. Pearl masters take steps to prevent scurvy and supply medicines to the pearling fleet. Charitable. In accordance with an ancient Arab custom, the Ruler gives, out of his private purse, free meals to all who may come for it every Friday. Fortunately there is no unemployment. A Director of Orphans” has just been appointed and an Orphanage is being established at once, purely it seems as a sop to ’’civilized” critics, since orphans in Kuwait have been well looked after by someone, usually the head of the child’s clan, or the head of the quarter in which the orphan was born, into whose family they were adopted. Now, in deference to criticism, the orphans will be treated more impersonally, and possibly less well. ^-b-UCc.tioii. There is free education in the four existing Government Boys’ schools and in the one Government Girls’ school. The number of trained masters, from Palestine, was recently doubled to make 8 and two Palestinian school-mistresses were brought in ior the girls’ school. There are also Kuwaiti masters. The total number of students in these schools is about 400. Every Kuwaiti boy goes to a Koranic school, which is unusually well run, and forms a sort of kinder-garten. For this richer parents pay, others need not. The/4. The Kuwait Oil Company hopes to open a small technical school at its Field for youths who later will he employed 'by them. There is a Free Public Library in the main street with plenty of bo 'ks and many periodicals. University education is usually sought at Aligarh or else where in India, but four boys are maintained entirely at the State expense at A1 AZHAR in Cairo. Military. Quarter Master Sergeant BOOTH of the Iraq Levies arrived by air on che 27th in order to give the Shaikh’s forces a three week refresher course in weapon training* Engineering. Mr. S.G. Murtaza, Assistant Engineer, Indepen dent Persian Gulf Sub-Division, arrived here from Bushire on the 21st in order to advise and superintend the building of a harbour and landing quays and help if required with other State and Municipal works, which at the present time X HO _L UU.O (a) Cb) ( c) Repairing the Town walls, towers and gate-houses. Repair of road to the palace from the housing area. Building of a prison -with 1st, 2nd and 3rd class compartments.

They are prisoners convicted ox sedition; v/ho are allowed to have their own food sent into them if they wish). (d) Building of the State ’’Hospital”. Municipal. Almost the first remark of every European visitor to Kuwait is aoout the most unusual cleanliness of the streets (due to an Alderrnanic system of responsibility) and of the people of Kuwait. the second comment is usually that the people look particularly happy, and the third remark is to contrast Kuwait with Iraq in favour of the forrmr. In so iar as Municipal facilities are concerned there arc the usual abattoirs, fish and meat markets under its control, all much improved within the last three years. There/t z 5. There is of course an Electric Light Supply, a Soda Water ^ Factory c. ; nd an Ice Factory. All these are private enterprises hut are under proper official control. There is a Chamber of Commerce and an Arbitration Court of merchants, as well as Pearl merchants’ and Divers’Disputes Court. Legal- Appeal can be made from the Law Court to the Ruler, who, with his Advisory Council, acts as the Court of Appeal. 40. frontier posts . (i) On March 26th Shaikh Ali al Khalifa, as the Shaikh’s representative, selected sites for the building of two frontier posts, near the Iraq-Kuwait frontier, to be manned by about fifteen men, and have passport control officials. The Political Agent accompanied Shaikh Ali on his tour, ia order to indicate to him, as nearly as possible, the line of the frontier. A courtesy visit was paid by the party to the SAFWAN post. On entering the yard it was found that the Police official in charge was away meeting the Mutassarif in Zubair, and that the attitude of the Iraqi Police towards the Kuwaiti was ug l y: tiiey l° a 4ed and half raised their rifles, vtfiile the car cre^s mounted their guns. ( One man was so excited that he tried to mount it upside down]). That the two parties have met without an incident is very much to the good, but there would have been an incident if the Political Agent had not been there. Ui) The Kuwait frontier post, which the party replaced, was removed again next day. (in 1932 the Mutassarif of Basra offi cially noted and recorded the position of this post, according to a letter to the Political Agent from his Adviser Mr. Jardine). On the 28th, passing travellers reported that not only had the board been removed but the holes in which it was placed had been carefully filled in and the ground smoothed over. This kind of thing, it can be safely assumed, is not the work of idle Bedouins, but of the Iraqi Police, and while it is not of course /6. very grave importance, it shows the mischievousness caused hy aghdad propaganda. 41. SHAIKH ? S DATE G/1R.BBNS IN IRAQ . Completely without warning and contrary to an official under standing, on the 18th, the Kairnakam of Ahul Khasih served a demand note for £19,480, from the heirs of Shaikh Mubarak, on account of past taxes, the note saying that if the amount was not paid within ten days, the properties would be attached. There was no description of the estates v/hich were to be attached, and the method of the calculation of the taxes which were claimed were omitted from the note. Before the ten days v/ere up, the Pao and Paddaghiya estates complete were both seized hy the Mudir of Pao, on behalf of the Iraq Govern lent. The tenants were evicted and others installed, and, according to the Shaikh’s evicted sub-agent from Pao, the Mudir immediately announced that he would welcome offers of purchase. On the last day of the month official information from Baghdad was received that an order for the restoration of his estates to the Shaikh had been issued from there to the Mutas- sarif Basra. 42. IRA^t PQhICh INCURSIONS INTO KUWAIT ThRHITORY . Two Iraqi police cars arrived about 5-30 p.m. on March 20th near camps 3 miles north west of JAHRA, i.e. 50 miles inside Kuwait territory. After dark, as they left the scene, the cars fired on the camps and towards the village with machine guns. There were no casualties. It seems to have been bravado. 43» IRAQ. On March 19th it was rumoured that all road traffic from Iraq to Kuwait had been stopped by the Iraqi authorities. It was subsequently discovered that the incoming mails had been turned back from the frontier by MEKKI EPPENDI, the Police Superintendent/0'^ 7. Superintendent at and that while cars were allowed to go into Iraq none of any kind would he allowed to enter Kuwait. This state of affairs continued on the 20th and 21st, so that the waiting and angry Kuwaiti passengers accumulated at Zuhnir. The Kuwait Oil Company was informed hy telegraph by their Basra agent that this order also applied to their lorries, which, if they entered Iraq, would have to obtain special permission in each case for return. The only information telegraphed by the Basra Consulate, in reply to enquiries by the Agency, was that }, the Iraqi Police ,f and the Mutassarif stated that the passengers stopped were 'those suspected of propaganda against the Shaikh'. Early on the 21st, passengers and Kuwait cars from Iraq were again permitted to enter Kuwait. According to the Kuwait passengers they had heard before leaving that 'Permission has been received for you from Baghdad' but no other explanation was given them. So far as is know, the Mutassarif of Basra has not informed the British authorities about this new system of checking all passengers to Kuwait, including British, at the Basra Police office where they must seek permission to come to Kuwait and, a.ccording to a British Indian official, also give their reasons# ABDULLA S.U.QAR, leader of the recent agitation against the Shaikh of Kuwait, has a certain number of followers, who had committed themselves to him to such an extent that they thought it best to leave Kuwait in a hurry after the events of Larch 10th. Most of them are living on Saqar in Basra. Abdulla Saqar was in touch with the notorious 'MATHANKA CLUB' in Baghdad and through it probably has connection with pro-Germans (Authority Royal -*ir Force Intelligence Summary) . A personality list of these persons is attached as an appendix to this summary.8. 44. IRAUI PRESS AND PROPAG^KDiV . (a) The follov/ing is an extract from the beginning of an article in 'aI Istqlal 11 newspaper of Baghdad ? dated March 6th, 1939: Last night (5.3.39) the Qnsr az eihour radio station announced the following in repudi r tion of the falsehoods made by the London Broadcasting 3t' r :tion n . (b) With the exception of articles in !, An Nr.s :r ejid 'As Sijil if papers, there have been far less in the Iraq press about Kuwait during this period, i.e. March loth onwards. (c) King Ghazi’s Birthday Broadcast speech ended as follows: 'Before concluding I should like to turn with my thoughts to our ^rab brothers in Syria and Kuwait , in whose future and welfare we are interested, hoping that with the beginning of the new year their national ideals may be obtained'. and not as was reported in the newspaper, i.e. without the mention of Syria and Kuwait. 45. GLRMAKY . The Attache of the German Legation in Baghdad has applied for a visa to visit Kuwait. 46. J.-F.JILSE . A Japanese attached to the mission, now in Saudi Arabia under the Japanese Minister at Cairo, has applied for a visa to visit Kuwait. 47. SAUDI ARABIA . On March 27th, London and Palestine, Arabic Broadcast, mentioned an official Saudi communique to the Egyptian Press, in which Ibn Saud emphatically denied a newspaper report that he was agree*ble to the inclusion of Kuwait in Iraq. 'Kuwait is Kuwaiti and belongs to the Kuwaitis' was, the communique said, his attitude. This has had a good effect locally. His Majesty the King is here reported to be coming to see his oilfields in Eastern Arabia between about the 10th and 15th April. 48/48. METEOROLOGICAL.

(Kuwait must be one of the last places of any size in Arabia to be acquiring wireless communications, as even outlying forts and small tow r ns in Saudi Arabia now have Wireless Telegraphy). It is hoped that some satisfactory arrangement will be come to before long for an up to date post office in Kuwait. (b) Anglo Iranian Oil Co. Ltd. Two aeroplanes of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Co.

(a) Reference paragraph 23 of Intelligence Summary No.4 of 1939. The Second Kuwait Council, which had not functioned as such, owing to their reluctance to accept the Shaikh’s veto, which, previously to their election, they had agreed to accept, was dissolved on March 7th. oome of the members, loath to abandon their position, and naturally much encouraged by the extraordinary and violent spate of broadcast and press propaganda from Iraq_ against the Ruler of Kuwait, counselled delay in handing over the papers and accounts of the Council to the Shaikh, xhey seemed to feel that, as long as they had some papers in their possession, they were still entitled to call themselves Members of Council, although they had already been dissolved and in any case nad never functioned. They were at last persuaded to hand in their papers when a Kuwaiti arrived from Iraq, where he had long lived, one MUHAMMAD AL MUNAIS, a former water^M3&amp;r-£is£^in Kuwait, and addressed a seemingly jTlt'f C hi* i &gt; vi 17 ^ Sr e* h \ O'M |3. authoritative and certainly impassioned speech to them and issued leaflets declaring the Ruling family deposed. This made the ex-members hesitate again. -- ^ The next morning the 10th, when MUHAMMAD BIN MUNAIS was being taken to prison under arrest, an ex-member of | * ^ Council, the hot-head YUSUF MARZOOK, and another follower of the Council, MUHAMMAD AL ^ I I'M MI, endeavoured to secure his release. There was an altercation. Muhammad fired on the Police and Yusif drew and aimed his revolver. The Police replied, mortally wounding Muhammad, striking Yusif in the foot, and hitting a nearby shopkeeper in the posterior. The tribesmen,and other military followers of the Shaikh then immediately flew to arms, and maddened as they had been by tnree weeks of intensive propaganda against their Ruler, were out to stand no nonsense from his opponents. The situation was a most dangerous one, and Shaikh Ahmad had great difficulty in restraining the populace and his followers. He was slightly injured by a rifle butt of one of his own men in doing so, and only secured some semblance of order by promising an immediate trial of Muhammad Munais. He was tried, convicted as traitor and sentenced to death, the public execution taking place the same day. Public feeling then began to be allayed, and order was restored by the evening. had the execution not taken place there would have been serious disorders, with probable loss of many lives. On the otner hand, it can be safely said that the change of Council would have proceeded without bloodshed if there had not been three weeks of intensive and disturbing Iraqi propaganda, followed up by the emissary Muhammad al Munais. It is agreea in Kuwait that those in Baghdad who have counselled such methods have the life blood of the two dead Kuwaiti Arabs on their hands, and that, as far as is known, no4. internal disorder and bloodshed of this kind has ever taken place in Kuwait before. Up to the time of writing this report the Iraqi propaganda which became intensified about February 12th had not ceased, and the heavily indebted Kuwaiti malcontent, ABDULLA SAQAR, was still being treated with honour. On the 11th five former members of Council were arrested, a number of other people were detained, or were temporarily put under 'protective arrest' and since have been released, while some others were arrested and tried. (2) His Highness formed a new and representative Advisory Council, of 14 members on the 12th and it commenced its sittings on the 13th. Its composition is nine notables, the remainder of the members being of the SUBAH family. (3) In connection with these recent events, the Shaikh has received most friendly telegrams and letters of congratulation from the King of Saudi Arabia (whose vivid communications come by telegraph to Jarya al Ilya and thence by car, almost every other day just now), from His Royal Highness the Emir Abdulla bin Hussein of Transjordan, (who sent a particularly cordial message of sympathy, having himself recently suffered from the Baghdad broadcast), His Highness the Shaikh Hamad bin Isa of Bahrain (whose rule and whose British ndviser has also been villified by Baghdad Press and Broadcast), from His Highness the Sultan of Muscat and Oman (who himself has not been spared by the Baghdad and Basra gutter Press) , and from numerous other potentates and Arabian notables. In fact, the Iraq attack seems to have served to emphasize the solidarity of the Arabians. From the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and British officials there have come special messages and congratulation on Shaikh Ahmad f s escape from5. serious injury. (4) The B.B.C. Arabic broadcast, which gave short but s** accurate accounts of recent events in Kuwait, and reported a question and answer in the House of Commons, arising out of the Iraqi propaganda, did much to encourage the loyal populace of Kuv/ait, who had for some weeks heard nothing about Kuwait except the references by Baghdad to its resemblance to the Sudentenland and its suggested occupation by the Iraq Army. (5) Sayid Hamid an Haqib, a deputy for Basra in the Iraq Chamber, has written to the Shaikh to say that he wishes to corne to Kuwait to tell him the truth about high politics and recent events in Baghdad, but private information from official quarters in Iraq goes to show that Saiyid Hamid is believed there to be bringing apologies from Nuri Pasha. (6) The Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, who was accompanied by the Political Agent, presented the C.I.B. to Shaikh Abdulla Salim in the presence of His Highness, Captain Young Jamieson, RN, officers and men of H.M.S. ,f Bideford', and the notables and public of Kuwait on March 5th. Much enthusiasm was shown by the populace, particularly by the women, whose shrill Sigarid marked in an unusual fashion, the arrival and departure of the Resident at the Shaikh’s pavilion. 31. SAUDI ARABIA. (l) The following is an extract of an article which appeared in the UMM AL QURA of Mekka, dated March 3,1939 The Arab daily paper ,r An-Nahar' of Beirut has published a letter sent by its correspondent in Basra, dated 2nd January in which the writer attacked bitterly His Highness the Bmir of Kuwait, whom, he said f was6 . supported by Ibn Saud v/bo was afraid of the Shabab al Katlawi, the Youth Movement, as it was about to spread into Nejd.' We reply to this as follows : ''The relationship existing between the two families, al-Saud and al-Subah is an old one. It is rather brotherhood than a mere friendship. His Majesty the King being a true and faithful Arab and the Master of Arab fidelity, is bound to be faithful guardian to the prominent and notable Arab families. It is not strange if His Highness the Amir of Kuwait expects kindness from His Majesty the King, as the two families have been true friends since long ago. His Majesty was very angry when he heard that a few Nejdis who live in Kuwait had backed the reactionaries against His Highness the Amir of Kuwait. His Majesty the King has decided to punish the mischief makers for going against the nature of the Arabs. They have committed a crime against the kind Amir who had treated them with our Arab hospitality. By writing as he did the correspondent of 'An-Nahar' paper has proved his ignorance of the real facts and from his writing, we understand that he knows nothing about Nejd and the Nejdis. There is a great difference betv/een our brains and the brain of this Basri correspondent, who has already proved himself to have no brain or any common sense. We have to declare that His Majesty the King is the heart and soul of all Nejd and the Nejdis. He (the King) is considered to be the only Protector of the Nejdis after God. His Majesty has done for us more than what we expected him to do. We are living in peace and prosperity. No oppression, no persecution and no one is sufferinginjustice, but everybody is living with contented mind. I may assure the said Basri correspondent that no one in all Nejd expects to have better than this happy life on earth, but only in Paradise. We Nejdis are true Arabs end true Muhammadans as well. We pay no heed to what you call 'The Modern Civilization', which is more or less against our religious and moral lav/. The Basri correspondent should have considered the fact that we Nejdis prefer our present Government and beloved King to any other system of Governments in the world. Thank God, the Holy Koran is read daily and everyone is careful in observance of his worship and daily prayer etc. We are all ready to obey the orders of His Majesty to fight in the name of God. Thus there is a great difference between the writer of that message and ourselves, thank God ' (2) The Shaiks Abdul Mohs in ai Hizir and Jarbu, Shaikhs of the Beni Khalid, with their followers, arrived in Kuwait on March 9th for the annual visit. These old oddities, hennaed of beard and most noble of lineage, descended from the builders of the original KUT, or defensive tower, after which this town is named, immediately placed their services at the disposal of the Shaikh, being sure, as they said, that their King would desire them to do so. 52. IRAQ, (l) The Iraqi Post Office, which has long maintained its independence of, and sometimes, according to the character of the particular postmaster at the time, defied the local authorities, was recently, in the stress of the immediate political circumstances, given its orders by the ohaikh, and a measure of censorship and control temporarily instituted. The Postmaster some days later announced thatQS a. ’’no object ion had been raised by the Iraqii Cabinet . (2) Incursions by the Iraqi Police . The Ruler reported incursions by the Iraqi Police on the 9th and loth March as far as four miles North of Jahra, (at the head of the Kuwait Bay). The evidence has been forwarded to the proper authorities, but independent corroboration was given to the Political Agent by various Bedouins camped on the. way to the frontier, on the 15th. On the 16th, the Political ^gent spoke to the new Iraqi Police Superintendent at SAFWAN, on the frontier. He is a Baghdadi called MEKKI and either pretended not to know, or did not know the meaning of the Bedouin Arabic words for the simplest things, or anything about the desert. 33. BAHRAIN.

Sir I have the honour to report that on February 12th the ^asr az Kihour Wireless station, Baghdad, (known here as 'King Ghazi’s Wirelesa n ) broadcasted some remarks about Kuwait. According to the Arab ^&gt;taff of this Agency it was as follows 'The announcer said before giving 'Internal Hews', 'I shall speak about Kuwait and its Council', and added that the viasr az Kihour Station would, in future, be used for propaganda about the condition of the Arab States of the Gulf, although on this particular night his talk would be about Kuwait and. its Council only. He attributed to one of the Council the saying that Kuwaitis would fight for their freedom, and went on about itrab Unity in the customary Iraqi way.

The net result is as summarised in my telegram quoted above, and I have little further comment to offer. The situa tion as you will see was quite serious at one time, and an armed clash was only averted by the efforts of de Gaury and tne Arbitration Committee# de Gaury was of course quite right uO treat the affair as an internal matter and to side-step «he Shaikh’s request for help from His Majesty’s Government. The 'pitted tomatoes' incident (paragraph 9 of de Gaury’s letter) is excellent, it might well be commemorated by the Ruling Family of Kuwait adding to their Coat of Anns* ' A Shaikh rampant upon a field of pitted tomatoes'. Incidentally, it is interesting to note that Kuwait tomatoes h a ve already acquired a certain reputation. Galloway, who h a s been burying his nose in Arabic literature for the last year out mat a certain Anin al Raihani who about 15 or so, points years ago wrote a book of travel entitled 'MUluk a l Arab' (The rings of the Arabs) gives a vivid description in it of the dire effects a dish of tomatoes which he had at Kuwait. Joubtless these were of the 'pitted' variety. Ssquire, K*C. j ? Th®. India Office DD. ** r.

For some time past an opposition party to the Council has been growing, due partly to the Sheikh’s secret encouragement, and partly to those who were naturally against the Council. The latter consisted of (a) Conservatives generally, wnich includes the ruling oubah family. (b) Merchants uho have lost monopolies which were cancelled by the Council. ic) The son of the nheikh’s late Gtate secretary, the De retary having been removed through pressure by the Council, and a n.exaber of the Council who had been expelled. Qdr (d) nn increasing number of the public whose deep suspicion was roused, by a tnreatened ’’numbering of the people”, or census, and whose further opposition was fanned by a recent ord r of the Council, aimeo at the Cubah, that dancing and drumming within the vTails of the city were forbidcen. ' I 5. His Highness mcouragea by, and in turn encourag- ^ ing, all these elements decided to rid himself of the present Council, which had frequently disregarded his wishes. 4. han he first told me of his intention I told him that it was an internal matter, but 1 gave him my personal friendly warning him that he should risk no failure.

After dark two of the members of the late Council, in dejected fashion, paid roe a call, hat they asked, in sorrowful tones was now their best coarse ?. I was gravely evasive. The following morning His Highness came to give 14. me an almost too full description of all his motives ana the history of his 'famous battle. rt I took the opportunity to confirm and so keep him apto the mark about the Reserve remaining under close control; that tiaere would be a new Council, and that he would retain a right of veto on the new Council's decisions. He ^eid emphatically that this was to be so. I i his excitement he let out a remark which on reflection he might not have made. 'That acourssd Council, he said, has taught us a useful lesson.' 15. Arrangements for the new elections are being made by the Arbitrators, and His Highness has pressed for, and succeeded in obtaining agreement to a larger and more representative electorate, to be in the neighbourhood of two hundred ana fifty, among whom will be representatives © of the old established ohiah families of Persian origin.

(b) On the other hand the people have established that for good or evil there is to be a Council. (c) It is satisfactory that the ariae reserve is He- *i\T sa-vw r &gt; ^ r !» once more under the sheikh’s control, as its possession by the Counoil was undesirable as I made clear in my telegram No.2C5 of 9th August, and the closing of the armcHirers shops, except for minor repairs is a good move. (d) The new Council, being more representative, is likely to be less( wrongly) nationalist! c, and zealOsis, and so better suited to the true interests of the country, than were the members of Kuwait’s tirst el acted council, whose extremism was evicent from the fact that they had had the courage to form a Council at all, and against the Ruler’s wishes. (e) The balance between the oheikh and the Council is now about level. In brief, administrative foundations in Kuwait are now sounder* Yours sincerely, (Sgd) G.

Yusif Murzook, a notorious hothead and a member of the Kuwait Council has been expelled from it. ife heard a rumour that the Council were about to ask the Sheikh to change his representative with the Oil Company, one Abdulla Mulla, son of the late State Secretary of the Sheikh, Mulla Saleh, and on this flared up, announced that he would protect the representative at all costs, and with arms, and publicly cursed the Council. The Council denied that they had any such intention at the present time: although it is probably true that they had reviewed its possibility. Yusuf Murzook, who is feeling a financial pinch, since he has been prevented from going to India for certain reasons for some time past, is alleged to have accepted a large ’’loan” which came to him from Abdulla Mulla and this rumpus, which has now died down, lo/ks as if it may have been engineered. It took place during the visit of an American Director of the Kuwait Oil Company. A vacancy thus occurs on the Council, on which an election will in due course be held.2 revenues and pay tne allowances to tne Snaiicn. a/id tne family. (d) (1) THe moat important feature of the Kuwait State finances is, nov/ever, tne revenue from oil, wnicn may in tne future assume considerable pro portions, At Bahrain tne present royalties on oil for tne 3haij£n come, as you are aware, to aoout £ 2o0,000/- per annum, and tne Kuwait i leid in tne course of tne next few years may well produce tne same reveriue 0 It was ooviously of importance to us to xnow wnat were the Shai^n*s intentions witn regard to tne disposal of tms revenue, and I therefore raised tne question witn nim. 1 was quite prepared for nim to say, in tne lirst instance, tnat ne was going to put the revenue in nis pocxet: tne concession is of course between tne Kuwait Oil Company a nd nim, not between tne Kuwait Oil Company and the Council* If ne nad taxen tms line I would nave argued, (as personally from layself not from His Majesty* s Croveinment), tnat ne would oe wexx advised to follow tne example of Snaixn Hamad at Bahrain and give two-tnirds to tne State (i.e, tne Council), and xeep one-tmrd for nis ^rivy j^urse.

If ne nad taKen tnis line ne would nave been on strong ground. It may be that tne SnaiKn tninks that tne Council will at some time in tne not too distant future cease to exist, or will lose their power to sucn an extent, tnat they will oecome mere ligureneads, and tnat in eitner case ue can avoid paying tuem apy money at all from tne on revenues.

His Higiness seemed, although it is hard to ’understand why, quite pleased with this arrangement. The Resident’s enquiries gave the Sheikh an opportt nity to put forward confidentially any regrets of complaints he had about losing the personal control of a possibly vast income, but he did not show the least inclination to do so • Kuwait. 20/10/38.

This was a healthy innovation as previously the Shaikh, unlike the Rulers of the other Arab States of the Gulf, would call on me alone and keep his family and notables deliberately in the background. Accompanied by de Gaury I then paid my return call on the Shaikh and Abdullah al Salim. The conversation at these calls was confined to passing the time of day and remarks about the weather, which after being extremely unpleasant had taken a change for the better. 3. The next step was to get into friendly relations with the Council and for this purpose at de Gaury’s sugges tion I proposed to the Shaikh that he should ask the Council to meet me for a cup of coffee in his palace. The Shaikh agreed to this and on the morning of the 6th de Gaury and 1 met the Council and each member of whom was then introduced to me. I naturally laid nyself out to be friendly, and thanked the member of the Council who rejoices in the title of / J.

The Shaikh definitely approved of it from his point of view, especially paragraphs (c) and (d), and it was arranged that I should see a Deputation from the Council consisting of the President, Abdullah al Salim, and 3 or 4 members in company with the Shaikh in order to deliver this message to them* On the morning of the 11th the Shaikh and Abdullah al Salim with the Deputation came to the Agency and I gave the Deputation the message which was well received by them, and in which they concurred. This was of course the most important point at iss ue* 6* In the last month or so the Council had addressed some communications to the Kuwait Oil Company direct. In itself this would not perhaps be very important, but I thought it worth while taking up with the Deputation. I explained that the /,3- the Company was a foreign concern and further that the Concession was in the name of the Shaikh. Correspondence therefore should be between the Shaikh and the Company* The Deputation accepted this as a principle, but tried to argue that in routine matters of unimportance they should have the right of addressing the Company direct so as to save time* There was something in this but I did not think it wise as a matter of principle to concede the point. I explained therefore that it was not of course our intention to delay the tfork of the Company in ahy way, and in course of time if experience showed that routine matters were held up by these having to go through the Shaikh, doubtless another method could be adopted. 7. such argument as there was at this meeting was of an entirely friendly nature. In fact in the Shaikh’s view too friendly i Ke remarked later at a private meeting which I had with him that my tone had been too mild with the Deputation, and that in future he hoped that I would speak to them more 'roughly'. The Shaikh has all a weak man’s urge for table thumping tactics, especially if these tactics are employed by somebody else on his behalf. He is still definitely, though more unobtrusively than previously, opposed to the Council, and would like nothing better than to drive a wedge between us and them. He would have been delighted, if I had been so foolish as t o adopt a bullying attitude to the Council to have emphasised this later privately to the Council to our dis advantage. Our policy of course is, while maintaining a measure of balance between the Shaikh and the Council, to preserve our relations with the latter so that they regal'd us as friends not enemies and turn t o us for unofficial advice, the more so as we have /teve obtained a good start with them (see paragraphs 10 and 11 of my demi-official letter N0.396-S, dated the 18th July 1938). It is hardly necessary to say that in my future meetings with the Council I did not ta*e the Shaikh’s advice. 8 # To sum up* (a) The written communication, referred to in your letter quoted above, has been given to the Shaikh and acknowledged by him with appreciation* (b) The oral communication has likewise been delivered to the Council and accepted by them without demur. (c) The Shaikh’s stoxhs which previous to iqy visit was somewhat too low has risen some points and at the same time the friendly atmosphere which existed previously between the Council and ourselves has been confirmed* de Gaury was of course present at all meetings and conversations and I have derived much benefit from his local knowledge and command of Arabic.

X I! Could you please refer to my demi-official letter i*o. C/804, dated the 19th October 1938, on the subject of the Kuwait Council. 2. Another matter connected with the Council is as follows. There are here a large number of individuals of the Shi*ah persuasion, probably as many as 18,000, the total population of Kuwait Town being, say, 65,000s these figures are extremely rough as there has never been anything like a Shaikh real census of Kuwait. In 1910, howeverj^ubarak had an enumeration made of the population of the town which showed a total of 38,000, of which 1000 were M Persians w . (The Bedu tribes and the villages in Kuwait territory outside the town are Sunni). 3. The above Shi*ahs can be divided into the following classes: (a) AJAEM i.e. Persians, numbers about 10,000. (b) HA3AWIS. Numbers about 3000. Shi’ahs from the Hasa Province of Saudi Arabia. These are the remnants of the old Persian conquest of the Arab Coast. (c) / J. P. Gibson Esquire, The Ind i a Off ic e, London. i BEfio. POL. BEPT. i 28 OCT 1938 INDIA OFFICE, , \S3) $52 ' - 2 - (c) Numbers about 3000. Sln^ahs from Baiirain and the coasts of the lower middle section of the Persian Gulf. (d) FITSTADRA* Numbers about 1000. These are Shiahs of those Arabs who emigrated from Arabia into Persia, and thence back to Kuwait* (e) Shi*ahs of Iraqi origin. Numbers about 700. 4. All these Shi’ahs have lived contentedly in Kuwait up to within a few months ago, i.e. up to the formation of the Council. Since then, however, they have shown signs of discontent. The reason for this is presumably as follows. 1 Under the one-man rule of the Shaikh the Shi’ahs were at any rate no worse off than the Sunnis. Moreover the Shaikh’s State Secretary, himself a Persian Shi 1 ah by origin, gave them a way of access to the head of the State in case of grievances. With the coming of the Council however - an entirely Sunni body, on which the Shi’ahs are not represented^* they feel that they are unlikely to get a square deal, though up to date they have indeed suffered no actual tyranny from the Council. This discontent culminated lately in applica tions being received by de Gaury, as Political Agent Kuwait, to the number of more than 4500 to become British subjects. The analysis of these figures is as follows: Bahamas ... ... ... 983 Hasawis ... ... ... 37 Iranians (in Kuwait less than 10 years) .... 170 Iranians (in Kuwait up to 120 years and all more than 10 years) *. 3457 4647 This /-5- hsh This figure- includes wives and children of the applicants but not their servants, male and female, which would bring the number up to perhaps 8000. When this move became known to the Council, they allowed themselves to become rattled and, in spite of some good advice from de Gaury, issued a public \ notice to the effect that anyone applying for foreign nation- ality would render himself liable to deportation. This increas ed the apprehensions of the Shi’ahs. 5. Even if we wanted to accede to these applications for British nationality we cannot do so under the rules governing the grant of British nationality to foreigners, which, amongst other stipulations, lay down that the applicant must have long residence in a British possession, de Gaury under my instructions has informed the applicants accordingly, through Said YUsuf Musawi, the Judge of the Shi*ah Religious Court, and the accepted head of the Shi*ah community. 6. Though the Shi*ah question is an internal matter, nevertheless it may have external repercussions since so many of the Shi’ahs in question are Persians, or of recent Persian descent, and if they are hardly treated the Iranian Govern ment may make representations to us on their behalf. Further, we are of course interested in trying to ensure that Kuwait, especially at the present time, continues without internal disturbances. This being so I thought it as well to have a talk with the Shaikh and the Council on the subject and on the 15th a meeting took pla.ce: the Mejlis was represented by their President and six members. I was accompanied by de Gaury. ?•/-4- 7. I began by saying that the position with regard to external affairs had already been explained to them at our last meeting, but there were certain border line cases which might arise from time to time, and which though internal might have external repercussions. On these it would be useful to have mutual discussions, during which I would like to give my personal and unofficial advice. Such a case in point was the Shi*ah agitation, on which for instance His Majesty’s Government might receive representa tions from the Iranian Government, and I asked what was the view of the Council on this matter. 8. The Deputation had no clear views except beyond insisting that Kuwait wa£ Arab territory, and that they wanted it kept as such, free from Persian intrigue and influence# They said that they could not possibly agree to the demands of the Shi’ahs, which had been for (a) special Shi*ah schools (b) representation on the Council (c) representation on the Municipality Council. 9# I agreed that (a) was a request which the Kuwait Government need not grant if they were not disposed to do so, but I suggested that (b) and (c) might be worth consider, ing# A single Shi’ah representative on the Council could not affect the Council’s decisions, but would give the Shi’ahs an opportunity of H letting off steam**, and I explained to them the inadvisability of*sitting on the safety valve.” The Deputation then repeated their views as given above / 10#-5 above, and said that in any case the Shi’ahs were given a chance to vote at the election of the Council. This is true, but owing to the system of voting adopted they were not likely to succeed in having a candidate elected. After some further discussion, in which I stressed that the responsibility for settling the Shi’ah question was in in any case theirs, the spokesman of the Deputation, the new State Secretary, a cadaverous individual named Sulaiman al Atsani, reverted to my simile, and exhibited an unexpected turn of mind by saying that they would prefer to keep the safety valve closed, but would, however, do all they could to reduce the head of steam by taking away the fuel l At this remark which caused seme amusement I brought the discussion to a close. 12. de Gaury tells me that the Council also hold the view, which they could not of course express to me before the Shaikh, that this Persian or Shi*ah problem is a legacy from the administration of the Shaikh, whose Secretary had encouraged Persians to ceme here. /L SCO, W ^ 4tx~ 5 *“) ^ •&gt; ^ 13. The above discussion I think did good as showing the Council that, though the responsibility for keeping things quiet is the Shaikh*s and theirs, we are not entirely disinterested in the question, and I trust that the movement | will now die down. Religious prejudice, however, is as you are aware not easy to control, and when complicated by the question of national origin, as in this case, it is always possible /~6 S' . (JS fi v possible that there may be a revival of the agitation. It is for this reason that I have described the situation at some length.

After the change it tried to insinuate that the movement was instigated by the British, with Imperialistic aims, and warned the Kuwaitis to beware, in an article which appeared in its issue No. 459 of 11.7.38. This was resented by the Kuwaiti residents of Basra who telegraphed to the Iraqi Minister of the Interior, and to several Baghdad newspapers, protesting against the attitude of 'An-Nas' towards their movement, and as a sequel the above warning was given to the paper1 tul&gt;AraMyyah t&gt; &gt; Qaii-o dated |l-9&gt; 38 Kuwait News, 1 f\T r ' t y* 1 drafting, a foundational law wjliajbi will l^eco^ie the Dastoor The legislative Counoil is pr j cm trie srork of (constitution) of Kuwait siiortly* ¥e are glad to announce on the pages of this weekly that the Iraq. &lt;k&gt;veraaent are sympathetic with that liefonos Movaqent, and an indication of this is the warning given hy them to tho Basra newspaper W A1-Has ,, f for insinuating that the Reforms Movement is instigated “by foreigners who f it is feared, may try to toy with it in the future.

It seems to us all to the good that the Sheikh, however reluctant ly, has introduced a measure of popularisation into his Government, On the other hand there is the risk, which we must do v/hat we can to mitigate, of some confusion, and embarrassment to us, resulting from the curious wording of the inaugural Law if the Council should seek to apply it literally. As yeu point} out in paragraph 6 of ypdr letter, it is impossible for us to deal with tv/o conflicting authorities in Koweit.^? On paper the Law (e.g. Articles 3 and 5) appears to us to give too much power to the Council, Even if the Council is induced to give up the authority in foreign affairs claimed for them in Article 3, there would/would still be a risk of confusion if the Council is to be regarded as the executive authority in internal affairs, since internal and external affairs will often necessarily impinge on one another. There would on the other hand be no harm in the Sheikh consulting his Council, even on occasion in regard to his foreign relations, as perhaps, for example, in respect of the treaties proposed to be negotiated by His Majesty's Government on his behalf with Ibn Saud. Probably it would be best if eventually the Council's main functions come to be confined to the legislative and judicial, while as regards administration their functions were merely advisory. In the meantime we agree that the need of co-operation should be impressed on both sides, 3, As regards the message to which you proposed should be communicated fronythe Sheikh we think that certain amendments are desirable in order to make it more palatable to the Sheikh 4&lt;mCcL an&lt;yencouraging any excessive ambitions on the part of the Council, and also to avoid any elaboration of the existing statement of our commitment to Koweit which was made in 1914. You are accordingly authorised to/Department to deliver a message in writing to the Sheikh on behalf of His Majesty 1 s Government in the following terms:- 'I am directed by His Majesty’s Government to inform Your Highness that they have learnt with satisfaction of your establishing a Council. They understand that in taking this step, which they hope will advance the best interests of Koweit, Your Highness has been actuated by a desire to associate the representatives of your people with your administration. His Majesty's Government look forward with confidence to a continuance in the future as in the past of the happy relations which have so long subsisted between themselves and the Ruler of Koweit. There will of course be no change in the existing arrangements by which His Majesty's Government conduct the foreign affairs of Koweit.' 4. With reference to paragraph 8 of your letter, we agree that a message should also be conveyed to the Council and that it should be suhsiawtially on the lines ye** suggests but subject to the omission of/ ja the word ’’constitutional 1 ’ in the reference to the Sheikh as the head of the State, 7 It-46 proposed however that the message should be delivered by ?-ovfle personally when / £e visit\ Koweit shortly, after hfe return to the /£* With regard to y^ur paragraph 10, v/e feel that there is no need to dr altogether for the present the question of a British Adviser.

(a) H.M.G. have heprd with satisfaction of the Sheikh’s decision to establish a Council with a view to associating representatives of the people of Koweit with himself in the affairs of his government. H.M.G. hope that this step will advance the best interests of Koweit. (b) In order, however, that this result may be assured the Council will appreciate the essential need of the greatest possible measure of willing co-operation between the Council and the Ruler. (c) The Council will also appreciate that any internal changes in Koweit such as the establishment of the Council cannot affect the position under which H.M.G. regard the Sheikh as Head of the State with whom their official relations will continue to be conducted. (d) Moreover the Council will of course understand that no such change can affect the existing arrangements based on treaty and long practice, under which H.M.G. are responsible for the conduct of the foreign relations of Koweit with other Powers and States^and control through the Sheikh matters affecting those relations or foreigners in Koweit. 'V- The Sheikh has been frightened by the internal movement of last July against him in Koweit into setting up a Council purporting to have far .wider powers than anything which Sir ?. Fowle can have contemplated when he advised him earlier to associate himself more with his family and people in his administration. The Law setting up the Council provides inter ali^ that its President (the Sheikh’s cousin, Abdullah Salem' represents the executive authority in the State. The idea of the Council and their party seems to be that the Sheikh should be merely the mouthpiece of his Council. At the best, the law is so obscure that we shall not know where we stand vis- a- vis Koweit until it is clarified; and we could not in any case agree to the supersession of the Sheikh by his Council as the authority with whom we deal in regard to r oweit’s foreign relations. I have discussed the matter with Sir ,T. Fowle. A letter to Mr. Weightman might be drafted on the following lines. It is all to the good that the Sheikh has (by his own action, however reluctantly) consented to a measure/measure of popularisation of his government, but on the other hand there is the risk, which we must do what we can to mitigate, of some confusion, and embarrassment to us, resulting from the curious wording of the Law if the Council should seek to apply it literally. As Mr. Weightman says, we cannot deal with two conflicting authorities in Koweit. The Law on paper gives too much power to the Council - e.g., Articles 3 and 5. Even if the Council is got to agree to give up the authority in foreign affairs which is claimed for them in Article 3, there would still be a risk of confusion if the Council is to be regarded as the execut ive authority in internal affairs, since external and internal affairs.will often necessarily impinge on one another. On the other hand, there would be no harm in the Sheikh consulting: his Council-even ^n occasion^ in regard to his foreign relations, e.g., the'prooosed treaties with Ibn Saud. Probably it would be best if eventually the Council’s main functions come to be confined to the legislative and judicial, while, as regards administration, their functions were merely advisory. In the meantime, we should impress the need of co-operation on bothsides. As regards the message which Mr. Weightman suggests we should sent to the Sheikh, the amendments made in pencil seem desirable/of) desirable, in order to make it more palatable to the Sheikh and to avoid any risk of encouraging the Council to be too ambitious, and also to avoid embroidering the existing (19|4) statement of our own commitments. as regards the oral message to the Council, the substance of it might be what is suggested at the end of para. 8 of Mr, Weightman's letter (with the omission of the word 'constitutional'), but Sir T. Fowle will deliver it himself when he visits Koweit shortly after his return to the Gulf. There seems no need to drop altogether for the present the question of a British Adviser. Such an \ adviser is desirable from our point of view. The Adviser would be useful inter alip in helping to promote co-operation between the Council and the Sheikh. ' e might sound the Council informally upon the suggestion. Possibly they might not dislike it, if put the right way. . r « •«n any further communication on this subject, please quote No- F /(.LhX 7/ and address —not to any person by' name, but to— J / “ The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W. 1. r 7 li • P 6091 1938 THE Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs presents his compliments to ^ 0 4^ y and, by direction^ of the Secretary of State, transmits herewith copV of the under-mentioned paper.

Reference paragraph 90 of the Intelligence Summary No.12 of 1938, describing the formation of a Council. The Council soon found that the Chief Secretary of His Highness, Mulla Saleh, who had for some forty years been in effect the Government of Kuwait, was still endeavouring tc undermine their influence and solidarity. An attempt by him to organize the Persians (of whom there are about 20,000) and some others, into an opposition made the Council determined to bring matters to head by demanding his dismissal, and after sharp exchange of views with the Sheikh, followed by a period of anxiety, when neither side would give way, and feeling ran very high, the Sheikh at last decided to send him away on a indefinite leave'. His young Syrian Private Secretary, Izzet Jaafar, had meanwhile wisely left for Egypt. Threats of disturbance have now died away, and the Council is busy about the administrative reforms, which were overdue• Note:- The 'Molla system' of administration, whereby independent, or semi independent but illiterate Sheikhs, placed their trust and their administration, in the hands of one literate man, usually a foreigner, was in the past common Kuwait must be one of the last places, among those in fairly close contact with the outside world, to abandon the system. The late Mullah was Persian by origin who had been the State Secretary since the days of Sheikh Mubarak, to whom it is believed he was presented by Sheikh Khazaal of At' Mohammerahw (E) 2 . At present the Mulla is at Zubair in ’Iraq, near Basra, but it is understood that he may be permitted to continue his leave at Zor on Palaicha Island in Kuwait Bay.*' .

August 1938 on tne subject of troubles at Kuwait. 2. I met de Saury in Basran on tne latn-19tn August and discussed tne wnole problem fully witn nim. rne comments and suggestions below represent our joint views. 5. Tne departure of tne Secretary on indefinite leave removes tne immediate cause of dissension, but does not, 1 fear, go far towards composing tne essential differences between tne Sbaikn spd nis council. In order tnat tnere may be no misapprenension on tnis point I snouid remark tnat de Saury nad nimself suggested tne leave solution in tne early stages of tne dispute, tnat tne anaiicn at tnat time rejected tne suggestion, and tnat tne deciding factor, as ne admitted to de Saury, was that ne nad been inf armed tnat tne Secretary would be stoned if ne did not leave Kuwait before daylight on the 16tn August, de Saury nas little doubt tnat if ne personally nad not made quite sure tnat tne Secretary did in fact leave Kuwait before dayoreaK tnat morning tnere would nave been serious disturbances; and ne informs me tnat tne Council did extremely well, in view of the bitterness of public opinion, to prevent an earlier outbreak. R. T. Peel Esquire, M.C.» The India Office, London« 4. /\^1 - 2 - 4 # i am afraid tnat tne uae of tne designation 'Private Secretary ' 1 in early reports naa tended to ooscare tne real issue. I myself read tots to refer to Izaat Jafiar wno nad nitnerto been described as tne Private Secretary wnile tne 'Secretary* was tne Persian Knan Banadufr mulla Saien. latter^ ofricial title was cnanged on iLue creation ol tne Council* Meitner person, nowever, could properly ue regarded as merely a member of tne Snaiicn* s personal ant our age 5 ootn were directly concerned in tne pre-existing administration; and indeed it is scarcely too mucn to say tnat mulla Saien was, the Government. Thus tnis dispute was (and is), in actual fact, a struggle between the new and old terms of administration. atte mp t to build up some sort of co-operation between tne Shaikh and his Council. This is clearly a most difficult 'i v problem and personally I cannot altogetner eliminate some feeling of regret tnat tne Snaikn nas now, according to de Gaury, completely put out of nia mind any idea of abdica tion. (With tne obvious successor, Shaikn Abdul±a oin \Salim, tne problem would oe infinitely simpler). t&gt; 0 The situation tnen, in its essentials, remains un- cnanged. The Shaiicn continues, in spite of de Gaury’s frequent attempts, to lead nim to a more reasonable point of view, to regard the Council as 'tne enemy'. tie displays not tne least inclination to co-operate witn him, and ne expects, * by nis request for a Britian Adviser, to enlist tne aid and support of His Majesty's Government against tnem. It is significant tnat ne told de Gaury tnat ne himself does not believe tnat tne Council will willingly accept an Adviser. de Gaury /-5- 1/ de Saury, too, is of the opinion, witn wnion 1 entirely concur, tnat any approaon to tne Council on the question oi an Adviser at tnis stage would be a serious error in tactics, for the Shaiin’s move is so obviously designed, and win unquestionably oe recognised in Kuwait, as an attempt to use tne poarer of the Brltisn Government to oreax tne council. And incidentally de Saury and 1 nave little aouot tnat it ne were to succeed he would lose no opportunity of shifting an tne odium on to tne snouiders of riis Majesty^ Government. On tne otner nand tne Council, wiiicn alter ai-i. is making / some attempt to begin to introduce reforms into tne administration, could at tne best only regard our advocacy of sucn an appointment at tne moment as a clear indication of mistrust of tneir motives and abilities. In sucn circumstances no Adviser could adequately carry out nis functions, and public opinion, reacting to tne Council’s resentment, must oecotme increasingly nostile to nis Majesty’s Government. 6. It seems to me tnerefore tnat our first step must be to disabuse botn parties - and in particular tne SnaiJcd - of any idea tnat we regard them as alternative and mutually repugnant manifestations of autnority in Kuwait, or tnat \ we are lively to take sides in tneir disagreemeifc s. no progress can be made until tne SnaiKn realises tnat nis Majesty’s Government recognise tne Council as an essential feature of tne administration of Kuwait and, by implication, tnat they are not prepared to assist in any manoeuvres it designed to destroy smsm. On their side tne Council must understand tnat in spite of tneir 'Inaugural liaw' we regard e**l, k TZszitp.' tne /-4- tne Shaikh as the symbol of authoriuy in Kuwait, anu t “* t » as Sir Trenchard Fowls reraarkel in paragrapn 10 ol official letter ao. 396-3 of the 18th July 1938, tne Snai-cn is still otlicially responsible for Kuwait’s relations witn His Majesty’s soven ment.

The *Inaugural Law* arms them witn greater autnority in respect of external affairs aid dealings witn foreigners generally tnan we can coral ortaoiy acknowledge. The exact terms of this Law need not be taken too seriously, particularly since it nas not been communicated officially to tne Political Agent, bnt it is, I suggest, essential to remove from tne minds of tne council any impression tnat we mignt regard tnan as tne sole repository of autnority in Kuwait /.wA - 6 - Kuwait, tUat we snould oe prepared to deal witn tnem to txie exclusion of tne SUaiioi, or tnat we snoulct tolerate tneif interference vdth foreign affairs or their assumption ol sole autnority in respect of tne otner matters recited in Article 3 of tne law. de Saury nas already t nr own out a few nints to tne members of tne Council on these lines, aid ne informs me tnat tney show no inclination to dispute his state ment of tne controlling power exercised by nis Majesty's Government# At tne present stage a fcrmai pronouncement made witn tne autnority of nis Majesty’s Government (a) tnat we regard tne snaikh as tne constitutional nead of tne State witn wnom our official relations will be maintained, ( b) repeating in general terms tue advice to tine ohaiich tc in regard to consultation ana co-operation, and (c) stating in unequivocal terms our insistence on control of foreign affairs ana dealings witn foreigners generally, would excite no nostile reaction, and mignti well serve ootn to ennance tne ShaiJoi’s prestige and to create a more reason able balance oetween nim and tne Council# 9. Action on the above lines will at least serve to clear tne air and to remove misunderstanding, out if it is to produce effective results it is important tnat it snouxa oe ta^en without delay, before Iraqi intrigue and influence is brought to Dear on tne members of the Council# 10. To revert now to tne ShaiJcn’s formal request for a British Adviser# It seems to me ti-at we can at tne moment only /-7 ignore tniSf and tnat de danry mignt oe instructed to reply to ary furtner enquiries i'rom tne Snaiicn oy saying tnat His Majesty’s Government await tne development oi a luiier measure of co-operation oetween nim axil nis council ani a clearer indication tnat tne request represents a decision ta!&lt;en by w tne snaiicn acting witn nis council* 1 before tney take tne matter into consideration. It is oy no means improbable tnat tne time will soon coue when tne Council will oe ready to look mucn more favouraoiy on sucn an appointment. The surprising unanimity wnicn actuates tnem snd tne wnole- hearted public support whicn tiiey eiy oy at present can scarcely last for ever, aid as tneir difiicuities increase so will tneir minds revert to tne idea of a British Adviser - an idea which appealed so strongly to many of tnem in pre- Council days, before tney tnemselves enjoyed tne savour of authority. I doubt if it is necessary to argue tne advantages of introducing a Britisn Adviser sooner or later, and if this is accepted in principle it will no doubt oe possible for de Gaury, as time goes on, to help tie idea take fresn root in tne minds of tne council. , . , . 11. I am afraid this letter is very long and contains kui Mujuu little tnat is immediately constructive, out it seems to me tnat constructive development cannot occur until our own position is understood quite clearly and until tne Shaikh in particular realises tnat we cannot oe lured into participation in nis schemes to destroy tne Council.

Ihere le daily ovary morning the usual Arab Assembly of the Ruling family end notables but it is very brief, and the Ruber does not obtain its consent to, or opinion upon, administrative decisions, , or consult or frequent the company of his family. in addition to Ms old Secretary, the Ruler, for the last three years, has employed as a private neoretary, a young pyro~ ? gypti«m, formerly working for the kooioty for the revmitlon of Crrielty to Animals in Beirut, (vide note received here from an Officer of C Branch obtained from the Jerusalem C.X.D* about him), who is most unpopular in where he is alleged to be, or have hem, an Italian agent. However that may be the Ruler, in recent years, hno^pmit less and less time at work, and more and more time with this private scoretary, sad others equally despised by the notables, in the 'private' quarter of Kuwait, the area of pavilions, and places of amusement, where they play flip billiards etcetera.The Administration Is doalt with below under the following headings* (a} Finance.

Corruption in Justice is a chief omiee of public against the present ndnintr« tton, m ahmat every mraber of th*&gt; public, in ®me imy or another, is effected. Tlx&amp;e who bov© not boon directly effected th^seelvos are in syiaiathy with nesfae fi»i©nd« or near relatives who have been imjuctly dealt with. The icoet open and chesmiesa aapeat of Justice, or rather injustice, in namit is that Bhaikh Abaulle, or the? Qassis, will give a certain tleoleion in a certain oaa© one day, and will give a reverse decision in anothex but exactly similar case the next day, always having om side of the scales heavily down In favour of ttm party which paid a price, or rather the party which pays higher.

IMtll about I9J55 it was the habit of the Ruler of “cuwait to t«ke an active part in the administration of Justice, and tm Ruler sat daily for a short time, in a public place* when petitioners* who might have been prevented from approaching him* or obtaining Justice otherwise* could come to him with their plaint#(d 'Jenaral.

SUBJECT. 4136a 1000 10.35Minute Paper POLITICAL (EXTERNAL) Department 7* Please see (a) the submission at P.Z.5309/38 regarding the Political Resident’s proposal to send a message to the Sheikh of Kuwait with reference to the newly established Council in Kuwait, (b) the Political Resident's report at P.Z. 5364/38 on the events leading to the establishment of the Council and (c) the officiating Political Resident’s telegrams below reporting on a serious disagreement between the Sheikh of Kuwait and the Council over the question of the retention of the Sheikh’s private secretary, Izzat Jaffar. Prom every angle it is most unfortunate a that fribe clash between the Sheikh and the Council (which for the present at any rate is reported to be pro-British) should have occurred so soon, and particularly over an issue of this nature. Izzat Jaffar is of Syrian extraction and though we do not know very much about him there have been rumours for some time that his intrigues have made him unpopular locally and, as will be seen from paragraph 3 of the Resident's report at P.Z. 5364/38, much of the propaganda which preceded the setting up of the Council was directed against this man. In view of his unpopularity with the new Council and his record as an intriguer, it eertainly seems desirable that he should be removed and, but for the Sheikh’s threat to abdicate, there would perhaps have been no need for us to intervene. The threat of abdication is not however a matter which can be treated lightly and, in view of the serious consequences that may ensue,it seems very desirable to do anything we can to prevent abdication on the issue in question. Moreover it is doubtful whe the r/l 2 . whether , as a matter of principle, we should admit the right of the Council to interfere in questions of appointments to the Sheikh’s personal staff, i^it should not he impossible to bring about a compromise which will save the Sheikh’s face while at the same time satisfying the wishes of the Council.. j SufoiU- .6}fvU {uaCUVvUlU, ) It is therefore - ^ ™ ^ * -- - * suggested&gt;that^we should advise the local political authorities to inform the Counci we cannot admit their right to interfere in questions of appointments to the Sheikh’s personal staff but tha if they withdraw their demand for the secretary’s remova! V- pressure will be put on the Sheikh to dispense' his services on his own account within a reasonably short period; at the same time the Sheikh should be informed of what is being said to the Council and strongly urged to agree. As regards the Sheikh’s request for an adviser it will be noted that Mr. Weightman has instructed the Political Agent at Kuwait to ascertain the Council attitude. If the latter is favourable such an appointment might be of considerable value in easing difficulties between the Sheikh and the Council; but pending information as to the Council’s attitude nothing further can be done regarding this question. In the li^it of these latest developments the proposal to send a message to the Sheikh in regard to the formation of the Council must be left aside for the moment.

Extract from Kuwait Intelligence Summary for tne period from the 16th to 30th June 1938. 90. Local Interests. Politic s. Kuwait has been suffering from an attack of infantile democracy. Better communications, the Radio, and the advent of an Oil Company are the causes. Paced with a request from most of the leading notables of Kuwait for the re-establishment of an Advisory Council, following on advice to do so from British official quarters, His Highness has agreed to permit a Council to advise him. A Council was a condition made by the notables, for his selection to the Sheikhdoms in 1921 but has been in abeyance ever since. The President of the Council, elected by the Council, is Sheikh Abdulla as Salim as Subah, C.I.E. The fourteen members elected by the heads of 150 families on the 29th June were as follows:- 1. Muhammad Shahin-al-Ghanim 2. Sheikh Yusuf bin Isa 3. Abdulla Al-Sagur 4. Mash’an Al-Khudair 5. Sulaiman Al-Adsani 6. Sayid Ali Sayid Sulaiman 7. Mishari A1-Hasan Al-Badur 8. Sultan Al-Kulaib 9. Abdul Latif Al-Thunayyan 10. Yusuf Al-Humaidhi 11. Saleh Al-Othman Al-Rashid 12. Yusuf Al-Murzook 13. Hamad Al-Marzook 14. Khalid Abdul Latif Al-Hamad. All are of well-established Kuwaiti families of Nejdi origin, except No.2, who is a Sabean by origin, from Subiya, on the Khor Subiya, but also long settled in Kuwait. The Sheikh’s Secretary endeavoured to form a coun - *-^-*' party mostly from among persons of Persian origin.

As regards the suggested reply to Bagdad, we feel that it might 'be a mistake not to give the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs a copy of the law governing the powers of the Council, if he should wish to have one. If the powers have already been correctly published in the Iraqi press, there can be no harm in giving a copy by way of confirmation; if they have been incorrectly published, it would be as well to let the Minister for Foreign Affairs have the authentic version. If therefore you have no objection,/ R.T. Peel, Esq., M.C. ENCLOSURE IN AIR MAIL LETTER no. JiT- 2 6 Alie 1938 FROM SECRETARY, POLITICAL AND SECRET DEPT. INDIA OFFICE COPY SENT ,i objection, we will add a paragraph to our telegram to Houstoun-Boswall, saying that he may give a copy of the law to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, should the latter ask for one. Yours ever,Sir T. Fowle discussed this very briefly with me this morning. Though the 'Law 11 giving the functions of the Council does not say so, it is understood that the Sheikh's assent is still necessary both to legislative and executive acts, though, if the Council functions properly, he will be placed somewhat in the position of a constitutional ruler. We agreed that the situation will need careful watching to see whether the Council develops any pro- Iraqi tendencies, and that in any case we must continue to deal with Koweit affairs through the Sheikh. The existence of the Council will of course give the Sheikh opportunities for playing them off against us, but de Gaury will be able to circumvent such manoeuvres. The dilution of the Sheikh's authority, though all to the good in some ways, may make the transaction of business with him more difficult for us in others. In negotiating fresh agreements with him, for example, or the proposed agreement^ between him and Ibn Saud, the existence of the/the Council, whom he will have to consult, will make for ♦ delay and possible differences of opinion about details. If developments of this kind become troublesome we may have to take steps to strengthen the Sheikh*s authority so far as Koweit’s external affairs are concerned. For t the present, however, we may wait and see how matters develop. While keeping on good terms with the Council (who fortunately start with being pro-British), we ought, it t seems to me (and I do not think Sir T. Fowle disagrees), to do what is possible to avoid getting at cross purposes with the Sheikh himself. I am therefore suggesting a slight alteration, with c which Sir T. Fowle concurs, in the message from « to the Sheikh. s■ t ‘Gould you please refer to correspondence ending 5 O 3 5/ifc' 4- 4- °U 3^ with, my telegran lTo*275 of 16th July 1958 on tne subject of Kuwait Agitation, in which I promised a further report. This telegram was sent after discussion with de Oaury who arrived here on the 15th, and whose reports had pre ceded him. 2. The course of events has been as follows. de Gaury duly presented my letter, mentioned in paragraph 4 of my Express Letter No.c /35 4 of isth June 1958 to the Shaikh, who in reply confined himself to generalities and compliments. He apparently had little idea of taking my advice. The fact that this advice had been given leaked out to the bazaars through the Shaikh’s Secretary - no Arab can ever keep his mouth shut even when it is to his interest to keep it closed. The advice in itself, however, was well received by the local notables, one of whom when calling on de Gaury, thanked him for the advice tendered. 3. Leaflets probably printed in Iraq continued to be issued by the 'Kuwait Secret Society', and further attacks on the Shaikh - specifically mentioning the brutal flogging of Al Barrak (see paragraph 7 of my Express Letter of 18th June 1938) - continued to appear in the Iraq Press. These 5 O 3 5/ifc' 4 .«+ ol/ 3iT leaflets and articles referred to the unfortunate Bari broadcast/ R.T. Peel, Esquire,-2- (fs^ broadcast axranged by tiie Sbaikli wliicb. was trie beginning* though not the cause, of the present trouble (see para graph 3 of my Express Letter ITo.C /ll?&gt; ^ dated 25th February 1938), critised strongly the Shaikh's entourage, especially izzet Jaafer, an importation from Syria, and demanded various reforms* (It was this same Izzet Jaafar who had sent the broadcast to Bari). 4. shaikh Abdulla bin Salim, the Shaikh's cousin who recently received the then called on de Gaury with a copy of the original agreement made between Shaikh Ahmad and certain notables of Kuwait whereby he - the Shaikh - had promised to form a Council as a condition of his election as Ruler (see P.G.13 page 73 paragraph 3. The Shaikh has never called this Council). Shaikh Abdulla himself, as one of the ruling family, felt that the present agitation might turn not only against the Shaikh but also against the family as a whole, and was shrewd enough to trim his sails to the rising wind. He is in any case, however, an individual possessing some learn ing and modern ideas. 5. Three of the leading merchants of Kuwait, who had a large following behind them, then requested the Shaikh to form a Council, the membership of which would be elective. This the merchants insisted on, knowing that nominations to the Council would be made by the Shaikh from his immediate entourage, and not from his family end the notables. The same night the heads of the 150 leading families of Kuwait met and elected to the Council 14 persons. The shaikh through his palace clique consisting of his Secretar ies/-3- Secretarie.a, the Director of the Municipality, and a merchant called Ehalid Zaid, made a last desperate effort to win followers, large bribes, and various privileges being offered to any one who would default from the Council. These efforts were fruitless and merexy brought further jcahci odium on the Shaikh and his clique. On the 4th July the rival parties, on the one hand xhe Ruling family and the notables, and on the otner tne Palace clique, including Khalid Said, assembled in tne Shaikh’s Mejlis for the usual morning coffee drinking, and for a final trial of strength. The following is an extract from de Gaury’s report. 'The members of the Council demanded His Highness* formal approval, in writing, of a Council, which verbally he had sanctioned, but it now seemed ^ad secretly tried to undermine. They spoke of his being misled by a few persons with private ambitions, against the wishes of the majority of his countrymen and against the interest of his family, which he neglected in favour of a few ignoble cronies. His Highness asked them what would be the outcome if he withheld his approval. 'in that case' said one of the leaders rising to his feet, and others v/ith him, 'we bid you farewell' His Highness quickly denied that he intended to disapprove. In fact, their trump card, had he done so, was ready, in the form of a petition, to be signed by all the notables, and presented at this Agency, asking for direct British Rule. His Highness then pretended to be, or was, per suaded of the worthlessness of Khalid az iiaid and his clique/L t -4- clique, and turning upon them, publicly denied and his followers who were immediately jostled from the Hall, and down the stairway, into the inimical crowd outside. His motor car had already been burnt. tt This was the only act of violence that took place during the agitation. His Highness postponed his formal consent to the Council for another two days, but finally on the 6th July signed the necessary document. Of the Council de Oaury writes ♦♦ The Council is composed of experienced men, used to weighing commercial enterprises, and conducting the affairs of their large families, and the messages I hare already received from them, make me believe that the result of their deliberations, if they obtain a decree of fiscal power, will lead to the administration of the territory on more efficient lines.” The President is Abdulla Salim. 7 . The powers of the Council, as you will see. from the document which I enclose, are extremely wide. (Some of the Law reads somewhat like the declaration; of the French Assembly in 1791. Abdulla Salim, who keeps an Arabic Encyclopedia, doubtless referred to it for guid ance when drawing it upt). In fact the Shaikh, as I stated in my telegram quoted above, for the time being is a cypher. The general policy of the Council can be seen fr om/-5- from the new Law, Article 3 which concerns treaties, monopolies and agreements is of special interest to us. Even here, however, the Council leave the signature of such documents to the Shaikh. The stipulation that any acts of the Shaikh need the Council’s consent, whether under this article or any other, is not so revolutionary as might appear. All the other Rulers on the Arab side of the Gulf, in Bahrain, the Trucial Coast, and Muscat, invariably consult their family and notables before taking any step of importance, whether this is with re gard to an agreement with His Majesty’s Government, a concession to an Oil Company, or a matter oi internal administration. The difference that in Kuwait the powers of the Council have been made so extensive, and reduced to writing, is entirely due to the crass stupidity - I can use no milder term - of the Shaikh (see paragraph 2 of my telegram quoted above). Even after he had agreed to the Council as elected, the Shaikh per servered in futile intrigues to undermine the Council, which merely served to exacerbate both them, and public opinion generally. 9 # Reference the leakage of ny letter to the Shaikh, referred to in paragraph 2 above. de Gaury is of the opinion, and I agree with him, that the arrival of this letter and its fortuitous leakage, came at the pyschological moment. The movement against the Shaikh was, as has been seen, overpov/ering, and a trial of strength between the popular party and the Ruler, in which the former were certain to have won, was bound to have occurred, either now or in the immediate future. My advice to the Shaikh to form a Council naturally fitted in with the plans of the popular party, and is indeed one of the main reasons that for the moment at all events they are extremely friendly y towards us. Had the movement, however, come to a head without/~\ c : ll NL - 6 - without this advice to the Shaikh, in popular opinion His Majesty’s Government might well have been supposed to have supported the shaikh - tacitly if not actually the victory over the latter would have been hailed as one over our His Majesty’s Government. As it is without/in any way off erring encouragement to the popular party, they are well disposed to us, while the coup d’etat, which is what the movement amounts to, has taken place - as de Gaury points out in one of his reports - without H the firing of a shot or the sending of a telegram”. The absence of telegrams is as gratifying perhaps as that of rifle shots. One can imagine circumstances in which the Council in tne course of their struggle with the Shaikh might have bom barded the neighbouring Arab States - especially Iraq - with appeals for help. Iraq at least would undoubtedly have been only too glad for an excuse to meddle in Kuwait affairs. In this connection de Gaury informs me that the present Mutasarrif of Basra is especially active in openly advocating Iraq interference in Kuwait - ’’which is really a province of Iraq”. 10. With regard to the future. It is of course much too early to lay davn definitely what our policy should now be in Kuwait, but generally speaking, we should, I think, try and maintain a measure of balance between the Shaikh and the Council. Towards the latter we should endeavour to retain their present confidence, so that they turn to us naturally for unofficial advice, while making it clear that we still consider the Shaikh the Ruler, and officially responsible for Kuwait’s relations with His Majesty’s Government. 1 11 . I have no doubt that, though the Council at present/ • :-7- present are sincerely pro British, as time goes by and their position becomes assured, they may display o V rt nationalistic” tendencies which may at times take an tr- —^ awkward turn. But the Council is in being, as a development it was inevitable, and we must make the best of the good start which we have obtained. 12. I would like to stress the fact, which both the Shaikhs of the Persian Gulf and ourselves must realize, that the idea of popular movements, such as the present one at Kuwait, ha^ now permeated the Arab States, and must be taken account of. Even on the backward Trucial Coast, at Debai (vide paragraph 3 of 'Jf- SOtOji* my Express Lette r iro.c/445 of 8th July 1938) ^ the opposition party to the Shaikh asked for certain popular reforms. In this connection also please see Govern- ment of India letter 1 To.P.230-n/ 35, dated 6th November 1935, and connected correspondence on the subject of agitation in Bahrain. This agitation has died away for the moment, as certain measures have been taken to comply with the demands of the Baharana, but I shall not be surprised if the latter, at some future date put up further demands for increased participation in the local government. Such movements will doubtless arise else where on the Arab Coast, and it is obvious that as the chief exponents of democracy His Majesty’s Government cannot ally themselves with the Shaikhs to stamp these movements out, even if this were practicable. What we can, and what in my opinion we should do, is to try by exercise of judicious influence, to ensure that such movements come to fruition by a process of ’’peaceful change as at Kuwait, rather than by violence, and that tney should, also as at Kuwait, be well disposed towards us.* sent under P.L.Ko.397-3 of 18/7/38. 13&gt; Various attempts were made by tlie popular party to enlist the open support of de Gaury, who, however, acted with tact and discretion in refusing to be drawn into the struggle, thus exemplifying the dictum contained in ohe introduction to the Political Department Manual'. 'The best work of a political Officer is very often what he has left undone”• I am afraid that I have made this rather a 14. lengthy letter, but in view of the importance which the events of the last few weeks will probably have on our relations with Kuwait in the future, I have thought it as yygll ■ fco put on record a more or less complete account oi them. * I am sending.copies of this letter to Hetcalfe, to Peterson with copies of recent telegrams quoted, and to de Gaury.• ,♦ ; &lt; Administrative Council as granted 'by H.H* the Ruler of Kuwait i ; \77) o n the 9th July 1938, / We, the Ruler of Kuwait, in accordance with the resolution passed hy the State’s Administrative Council, do confirm and sign this law about the powers of the Council, and we have ordered that it may be put into effect.

The situation in Koweit is that Council, under presidency of Ahdullah Salim, cousin of the Sheikh, have obtained complete control of the administration and, for the time being. Sheikh is a cypher. | 2. If Sheikh had formed a Council as he originally promised (see P.G.13, page 73, paragraph 3), or if he had taken the verbal advice of His Majesty’s Government (vide correspondence ending 3 5*4 with India Office te legram No. 986, May 24th ), or had, at the last moment, formed the Council as suggested in my letter of 18th June l+t+olj zr to him (enclosed with my express letter No. 0.334 of June 18th) this Council might well have remained advisory instead of an executive one. 3.

The previous submission is flagged ’A’ (P.Z.29 62) . From the Political Agent’s report forwarded by the Resident on P.Z.4401 (flag ’B’) it would seem that the Sheikh was not, to begin with at any rate, in a very contrite mood; he apparently had not been sufficiently frightened by the agitation against, and the criticisms of, his administration. The Resident undoubtedly acted rightly in following up the Political Agent's conversation with the Sheikh with a personal letter suggesting that the Sheikh should proceed to form a Council, on the lines followed by Sheikh Mubarak, for the closer association of his family and people with the eose wt iq76o/p 42 1000 5.37 icp administration. The Resident’s letter has borne/ SEEN political committee 1 9 JUU 338borne fruit very quickly; the Political Agent reported on the 6th July that the Sheikh had set up an administrative Council, under the presidency of his cousin Sheikh Abdulla al Salim al Subah, on whom the C.I.E. (Hony.) was awarded in the last New Year Honours List- Abdulla is said to have acted hitherto as Regent while the Sheikh was absent frcm Koweit, and to be well- disposed to H.M.G. As a first step, this is very satisfactory; whether it is successful depends on the extent to which the Sheikh co-operates with his Council. u-^cnl h STlv ^ «xrv*&gt;^c/ ^1**.

J ^^ ’ * I 19.38 | nv. o ivDiTQR of al-si:jxi. . x n your last Issue there was an article against the firm and erect pole of Hulership in Kuwait in which you directed bitter criticism ugainet the innocent and heroic administration of the State* There is no doubt that this ie a sin* for which it should be your duty to atone by a good acts Hew can it be, that Kuwait, which takes pride in her hws and the Hulership, is the only one amongst all Gods’ own countries, which helps her strong neighbours to promote their propaganda, although they may not be of her own religion, and adverse to her interests# Here is an example to prove my assertion# There is a protestant American foundation, a Hospital, choked full by the sick of the Muslim Kuwaitis, who fall a prey to their continuous religions preachings, prayers, and verses of Chwrch hymns. Sach morning its compound is full of patients including the rich, whose wealth is extracted from them by every possible means# They are compelled, by its being the only hospital in Kuwa.it, to come to it although it lacks proper and sufficient materials, owing to which many of the patients have passed away, a sacrifice to lack of attention. The Alfcrate has helped these Am Americans by allowing them to import alx tinir materials duty free, notably religious books, and although this respectable Amirate receives C ^etoms duty on all books imported or exported from Kuwait, even the ;*oiy Koran Forbearance in religious matters has reached its utmost, and some Imams and Kuaxsins do not come for morning prayer® and no heed is given to the complaints of membere of the2 of the congregation* Amongst the good acts, upon which none has commented, of this Amirate, is its being the only one which has an admirable speciality of imposing internal Customs duties, as no one of the dwellers of the small Tillages of Kuwait, such as Jahra, Fantas etc., can take cut from Kuwait City a single bag of rice or any ether necessary foodstuff, without payment of one rupee, or mere, per bag. The people of Kuwait look forward to the foundation of / schools with much eagerness, and they hare been for the last thrity years trying to open schools and a free State Hospital, but they met with bitter opposition from Shaikh Mubarak, grandfather of the present Amir. The great toleration of the Kuwaitis has promoted them to name the Mubarakiyyah school so to please that late Amir, and the other Ahmediyyah school as a mark of encourgemeat and a constant reminder to the present Amir to proceed towards progress, even at a slow pace! The hope of the people for a hospital was swept away by one angry mood from H.H. Shaikh Mubarak. The present state of affairs in Kuwait does net permit anyone to instil into it a life of enlightment and activity, or the freeing of the public from ignorance and disease. Anyone who tries to do so will find that canes, whips and imprisonment in the 'shop*, which is well protected from ventilation, are ready for him. His Highness the Amir is very fond of the guitar and its strings and he always keeps very neater to him those who know how to play it. Kis overbearing desire, to leave all matters as they were, has promoted him to bring in Propagandists, and converts of Free Masonary, and converts of other sects oi self pleasure. As to your bewallings, you newspaper men, advocates of education, lovers of reforms and supporters of personal independence for individuals, you should knowknew that there is ft wide space between you and tue demands of His Highness, our Amir the Preux Chevalier, may God preserve him, and his Chief Justice of the Courts, Shaikh Abdulla al-Jabir, who penalizes anyone who does not come to his Court. With the first messenger he sends notice, a fine for delaying, ofyijfew thousands of rupees, a matter which has necessitated seme of those so pe; A b^. ^ u to flee away from Kuwait, and take refuge at Subair. We, of the entourage, do not care in the least about each resentful persons. Know, you poor journalist, that Kuwait is proceeding on the way which pleases the entourage of her Amir, whether it pleases or angers you, 0 supporters of those foolish Kuwaiti youths. I have some more strange and wonderful things which X shall write you about if you publish this my article. In the end I pray to Allah not to displace our present dearly beloved.

After a number of these attacks had appeared, the Private Secretary to the Shaikh of Kuwait wrote an open letter to the Iraq Press, which was published^in n Az Zairian’ 1 newspaper; in this he advised the iraq newspapers not to interfere in the internal affairs of a friendly Government and to stop trying by means of this unfriendly propaganda to s.tir up the people of Kuwait against their lawful Government. This has, as yet, had no effect on the volume of propaganda against the Kuwait Government and as the Iraqi Governim it control the pre ss it can only be assumed that these press attacks meet with the Iraqi Governart ’s approval. It seems strange, indeed, that the Iraq Governant, who v/ere recently so indignant at Syrian press propaganda directed against themselves, and who threatened retaliatory action if the propaganda continued, should look wth complacency on similar unwarranted and unfriendly attacks by their own press on the Kuwait administration. The Iraq press constantly^ refer to Kuwait as being an integral part of Basra Liwa. In this connection it is interesting to remember tnat during the recent debate on the Iraq - Iran Treaty in the Chamber of Deputies, one leading Deputy referred to the possibility of Kuwait being used as Iraq's outlet to the sea*CONFIDENTIAL.

The Ibth June, 1958. (ill you pleasa refar to your Express letter Ho. 297-S of 271a May, 1938. I spoke to the Ruler today as you instructed me to do. Some time has elapsed since my report on the l.*th jarch and His Highness, as X had thought not 1. probable, now endeavoured to pass off the movement at the tike of the al Barrak incident as nothing of importance, saying that there was no popular or democratic movement in Kuwait. ..y suggestion he said was something new, where had such ideas come from? Such movement as there had been, had arisen from the activities of an Iraqi intriguer, one al :t?aiuhi, who had come down on a boat taking away gravel for the ..nglo-Iranian Oil Company. This man X had not heard of before and I said I was surprised he had not mentioned to me his subversive activities. 2. As for al Rarrak, the Ruler said, that he was punished as he deserved and that -was that. I said that this would not do. There had been torture, and I repeated firmly what I had said before that there was to be no repetition of this kina of beating to extract information, and day after day. A definite number of strokes awarded as a punishment was a different thing to just 'beating up' a prisoner for an Indefinite time, which was not to occur again. His Highness had nothing more to say and only screwed up his face - like a child about to cry. Lt-Colonel Sir Tranchard Po-vle, K.C.X.E. ,C.B. i. , Political Resident, Persian Gulf a n s H I R E.— ° — ** S. The suggestion that any new democratic movement should be drawn by him into useful channels seemed to be I beyond his comprehension, and I believe that it is, A movement of this kind is, in his view, to be suppressed firmly and I doubt if even a lengthy explanation would convinc him of the soundness of any other policy, buch understanding as he has acquired of political forms, has, I fear, long ago ranged him on the side of dictators. I will however, from time to time, endeavour to educate him upon this subject. 4, With regard to a closer cooperation with his family and people in the administration he said he thought his cooperation was quite close enough already, and that no alteration was desirable, .as soon as Oil Royalties began to come in he would undertake the various improvements that were needed, such as a hospital and better educational facilities. I had put these two examples into his mouth, as I had askea him what he meant by improvements, was it such things, or did he mean a change in the shape of the administration ?. 5 , He was surprisingly unemphatic in his reply about the appointment of an Adviser, It may be that he has been expecting such an appointment, and that the various statementg which have appeared in the press from his becretary’s pen, to say that he has no Foreign Advisers, that Colonef. Dickson is not his Adviser, and so on, have been merely an attempt to stave off what he has regarded as inevitable. 6, In any case, he had nothing much to say about it, and only asked what the Adviser would advise about. I said the a ministration of course, and anything on which His Hi -Jiness might need advice. Ke only shrugged his shoulders, and said the Government was able to go what it wished7* His Highness, who, at first, in his usual lively manner endeavoured to brush aside any criticism, had by the end of the interview a quieter and more reasonable air, and was more Impressed than might be apparent from his replies. 3 # I am submitting, in a later mail, a comprehensive report on the present administration of Kuwait.

Private news from Kuwait indicates that the com mercial circles in the Coastal Arab States are discussing the advisability of approaching ‘Iraq upon the question of the conclusion of a united trade agreement between ‘Iraqi Kuwait, Bahrain, Hasa and Qatr on the basis of commercial co-operation between them. Most probably a trade mission will be formed from Kuwait and Bahrain prin cipalities to visit ‘Iraq and get in touch with official and private quarters for realising this great project.Mr, Gibson, I- / fcrr./L ^ Re Mr. Symon*s note of 21st instant and mine of 14th instant, particularly paragraph 2^ The repercussions outside Koweit have not been as extensive as I anticipated and the local situation is quiet. A copy of the article forwarded under 1 Mr. Weightman 1 s printed letter No. C/180 of 29th .larch was harmless enough. In fact it seems to me that the Iraqi press have from their point of view missed a first rate opportunity of attacking Koweit and indirectly His Majesty’s Government.’ ^Paragraph S- .Z.At the same time the incidentjhas attracted some publicity in the neighbouring country of Iraq and I do not think we ought to let i4 pass without notice, if, only to prevent a repetition. Para-graph 4r.3,1 suggest, therefore, that I be authorised by His Majesty’s Government to approach the Sheikh verbally on the following lines (a) So long as the internal administration of Koweit is carried out on proper lines. His Majesty’s Government have no desire whatever to interfere in that administration. On the other hand, they cannot be indifferent to serious incidents occurring in that State since owing to their special relations with its Ruler, they are in some measure held responsible by the public opinion of other countries for the way in which such incidents are dealt with. ^His Highness will doubtless understand this important point). (b) His Majesty’s Government have heard with regret of the incident in which a certain A1 Baruk was involved. They quite recognise His Highness’s right2. [h.XMtS/JSj to maintain law and order in his State, hut they VK consider the treatment meted out to A1 B&amp;ridk is quite unnecessarily severe* (See paragraph 1 of Captain de Saury’s letter No. C.131 of 19th March). Flogging in itself, within certain humane limits, is a punishment recognised by many Governments, but repeated floggings to obtain information such as were inflicted on A1 Barjdk is nothing short of torture.

His Majesty's Government have no desire to give an opinion on the rights and wrongs of this movement, but that it indicated a definite and general discontent with His Highness's rule is evident, and as His Highness will, of &lt;L course, realise it is the business of the Ruler to conduct his administration in such a way that &lt;&lt;oc S general discontent -44^ not arise.

His Majesty’s Government feel that the risk of a repetition of the present unfortunate incident would he considerably lessened if His Highness would associate himself more both with his family and his people in his administration, and in giving this advice His Majesty’s Government take into account that the normal practice of government amongst Arab peoples from time immemorial is for the latter to be associated in some form or other with their Sheikh in the affairs of the State. His Majesty’s Government would be glad to have the views of His Highness as to this suggestion.

I saw Capt. de Gaury on my way through Basra, vide para. 4 of my express letter No. C/149 of 22nd March (P.Z. 2148), and discussed the matter with him. 'is views were as expressed in his express letter of 19th March, No. C/129. 2. The seriousness of the situation in my opinion depends partly at any rate on its repercussions in adjoining countries, especially Iraq. In para. 4 of his letter No. C/131 Capt. de Gaury reported that several persons in panic had left Kuwait for Iraq, and I imagined that the Iraqi Press, which as you know takes every opportunity of attacking Kuwait, would have taken this opportunity of a fresh onslaught. They could have attacked the Shaikh of Kuwait as a brutal and high-handed Dictator suppressing a popular movement, and - what would have affected us - could have represented him being supported, either actively or tacitly, by H.M.G., under whose protection he is. If such articles had appeared they would probably have been copied by the rest of the Arab Press further afield, and the European Press, or rather sections of it., e.g., the Italian, might have taken it up. Before our present detente with Italy the incident ”Ould have been welcomed by the Bari Broadcast. 3. I therefore asked Capt. de Gaury to telegraph to Mr. Weightman, repeating to India Office and G. of I., any repercussions that might ensue in the Iraqi Press. He has not telegraphed and so I assume that, contrary to my expectation, the Iraqi Press has not taken advantage of the incident - why I don't know. Nor has he reported further on the incident itself, so I assume that all is quiet. 4. I suggest however that a telegram be sent to Mr. 'eightam, repeated to Capt. de Saury, oopy by „ r Jf Govt./ ' C ,.G-ovt. of India, referring to my express letter No. 149 of 22nd l arch, and asking (a) whether any articles on the . incident have appeared in the Iraqi Press, (b) How does the situation now stand.

The unfortunate Italian broadcast already reported (see correspondence ending with my letter No.C/il8, dated 25th February 1938, to ./alt on) focussed attention on the Kuwait administration and an article appeared in the Iraqi newspaper 'Al Kifah*' criticising this administration.

I spoke to His Highness accordingly on the 9th March, making my points in the order mentioned in your letter, to which he replied as follows:- He had thought that there was no harm in *good propaganda', about the cleanliness of the streets of Kuwait and so on. The lecture which he had permitted to be sent did not include the statement about a protest by him against British activities in Palestine. That had been added by the Italians, no doubt taking their information from newspapers, and every one knows how misleading are newspaper articles. His reply as to why he had not asked for the broadcast to be made from London was evasive, but he said that he v/ould in future ask us to broadcast his publicity. He would, he told me, never never again send, or permit to be sent by any of his entourage, a contribution to the Italian Station's broadcast, repeatedly adding with emphasis 'I give you my word for it'.

Reference correspondence ending with your telegram No. 69 of the 18th February 1938. 2. There has been some inevitable delay in dealing with this matter ov/ing to the slowness of the mail service between Kuwait and Bushire, my present lengthy tour, and a hunting trip of the Shaikh’s. 3. I instructed you to ask the Shaikh verbally and informally v/hether the Bari broadcast was issued at his suggestion or with his knowledge, and after some hedging he has now admitted that he knew of it prior to despatch, and supposed that there could be no harm in good propaganda. (You strongly suspect that the actual sender of the broadcast 4 was an Egyptian-Syrian, Izzet Jaafar, the Shaikh’s Private Secretary). The Shaikh you report at your last interview seemed low spirited and has presumably learnt a lesson. In this connection you previously reported that the effect of the exaggerated tone in which Kuwait and its Ruler were referred to in the broadcast had appeared to most thinking Kuwaitis as ridiculous 4./4. At the same time I do not think we should ignore the incident as it may encourage the Shaikh to repeat the performance. You should therefore approach the Shaikh verbally as follows. That I have heard from you with regret of the broadcast in question. In the first place, in view of the close relations which exist between His Highness and His Majesty f s Government it was in my opinion entirely incorrect of him, without any re f er &gt; ence to us, to get into touch with a Broadcasting Station which, as all the world knov/s, has for some time past adopted an extremely hostile anti-British tone. In the second place the political part of the broadcast that the Shaikh 'has strongly voiced his protest against British activities in Palestine” v/as, again in view of His Highness’s close and friendly relations with His Majesty’s Government, objectionable. In the third place, as His Highness knov/s, we have recently started an excellent broadcasting system of our own through the B.B.C., which already by reason of its balance and truthfulness is far more trusted by Arabs than that issuing from Bari. Why did not His Highness ask us to arrange for a broadcast from London instead of Bari? If His Highness wishes publicity to be given to his State, an object with which I entirely sympathise, all Governments in these days use publicity, I trust that in future he will approach us with a view to it being done through the B.B.C. 5. Please report His Highness’s reaction. (Sd.) T.C.Powle. Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Attested. (Sd.) J.N.Cotton. for Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.p Si 4 # O^) On the evening of Tuesday the 25th, Bari broadcast an article about Kuv/ait v/ith such exaggerations and undue praise of the Ruler of Kuwait, the people and the town, so that, as people said, it was like a description of Heaven and the Angels. Kuv/ait was described as being the Bride of the East and a great city, surpassing some of the great capitals of Europe, having a great and enterprising Municipality, which has made the city a model of modern progress, the roads being very clean, and wide, and everything built in the most modern style, and by the most modern methods. The city has two sections, one is built on the Eastern style, and the other on the Western style. It has over 70 of the best schools imaginable, and besides many educational institutions it has a library built and maintained by the Ruler v/ith tens of thousands of the best and rarest volumes. The Ruler Shaikh Ahmed Al-Jabir Al-Subah is one of the most enlightened rulers in the world and he spends sleepless nights in looking after the interests and progress of his state and the welfare of his subjects. He is comparable to all the friends of the Prophet Muhammad. He is as just as Abu Bakr, as courageous as Omar, as religious and chaste as Othman, and as heroic and brave as Ali. He always stands fearlessly in defence of all Arabs, and he strongly voiced his protests against the British activities in Palestine and sent large contributions for helping the Arabs there. The budget of the Kuwait Government is one of the best balanced in the world and not a cent is ever spent uselessly, and H.H. spends large amounts from his private income towards charities, institutions and the general welfare of his subjects. He visited Europe for the sole purpose of studying modern methods/2 methods of progress which he introduced into his state. The people of Kuwait are very prosperous, progressive and content all due to the enterprising energy of their great ruler, and they are some of the most heroic in the world. All Arabs should visit Kuwait to see it and observe its great progress. 2. The above is only the essential part of the announcement which went on with some more exaggerated details.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0001ce_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/3894A</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0001ce</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/3894A</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 30/158 'Koweit: Disturbances, 1938, and consequent administrative changes.
