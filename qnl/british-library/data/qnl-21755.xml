Iv IFDIA OFFICE, * h P.Z. 716/40. WHITEHALL, S.W.l. 12th February, 1940. Dear Handley, Would you please refer to your letter of the 5th February, 1940, 3#586515/59/F2 in regard to rates of pay for the Indian Army Adjutant and IT. C. 0. Instructor to be employed primarily at Bahrein under the Persian Gulf Defence schemes. We have now seen correspondence between the political Resident and the Government of India in which the Government of India say that they have already called for volunteers, without stating any special terms, but have had only four applicants all of whom are unsuitable. It is, therefore, obviously necessary to offer terms which will bo a sufficient attraction to Indian Army officers to persuade them to put up with conditions in the Gulf, with separation from their families, and with the extra expenditure involved in maintaining two establishments. The terns which you suggest in your letter for the Adjutant seem to us quite inadequate to achieve this object. On the lowest rate of pay for a married Indian Army Major these show a loss of about £10 per annum as compared with Indian Army pay, inclusive of separation allowance and additional pay as an Adjutant under Indian rules and taking into account that single rates of lodging allowance would be withheld under Indian rules if free quarters were provided. I enclose a statement showing how these rates are made up. We appreciate that your proposal is based on a comparison, which you are naturally bound to make, with the Air Liaison Officer in Bahrein who is a Squadron Leader, but we should like to point out that, as we understand it, the Air Force officer is/ E.W.Handley, Esq., Air Ministry, (Dept. QJ), Adastral House, Kingsway, W.0.2. mis posted to Bahrein as part of his nornal duty, whereas an Indian Army officer can only he ashed to serve there voluntarily. This fact in itself justifies the grant of considerably hotter terms to the Indian Army officer, and it is surely well recognised that an Indian Army officer receives a higher rate of pay than officers of the British Service in respect of his continuous service in the East. If you see objection to the Government of India’s proposal as it stands it seems to us that it would be much better to give Indian Army rates of pay plus an allowance of about £250 per annum which will produce a result similar to the Government of India’s proposals. Unless this is done we are very doubtful whether a suitable volunteer will be forthcoming. On receipt of your reply we will put to India the proposed rate for the Instructor. Yours sincerely, n.

My letter of 8/11 leaving here today fully explains situation. Local Defence Volunteers are intended to be used for defence against air attack as well as ground attack. Unlikely these will be simultaneous. Personnel to man searchlight must be found from local resources. Searchlight is of little use during periods of bright moonlight and at other times consider it suffi cient if crew sleep near light. Instruct Defence officer Persian Gulf to arrange in consultation with S.N.O.P.G. Air Liaison Officer and Oil Company. Regret cannot arrange revisit to Bahrain present time but will send representative at later date when question of guns crew is settled. Matters requiring decision regarding black out measures should 1 be referred to Defence Officer who will consult A.H.Q. on any specified points if necessary.

Dear Kennedy, The Air Officer Commanding has undertaken to provide crews for the anti aircraft guns, but he regrets that he is unable to find personnel for the search light and he requests that they be found from the Local Defence Volunteers. In his opinion the search light is of little value during bright moonlight and he considers that it will suffice at other times if the crews sleep near the gun. Could you very kindly let me know whether you agree to volunteers who are off duty being employed for this purpose ? It is believed that this duty will not cause appreciable dislocation. Dr. R.

His Britannic Majesty's Political Agent, BAHREIN. Dear Sir, DO. 0/878. I was relieved when I read your letter The day before yesterday I had a long conversation with the Air Liaison Officer, after which I wrote him a letter, copy of which I enclose. In it I offered him the use of a score of men for gun and searchlight crews. As the gun crews are now being supplied from Iraq., I presume he will have no difficulty in getting a searchlight crew from the volunteers here. I think it will be fruitless to go into details until the light is here and we know how many men are needed to run it. Yours very truly, Chief Local Representative. THE BAHREIN PETROLEUM COMPANY LIMITED.mJ VW&gt; - &lt; T. Awali, 12th November 1940. The Air Liaison Officer, Manama, Bahrein. Dear Sir, I have consulted the Management about the tonics you raised during our conversation yesterday. The Management's opinion about letting Comaany employees form gun and searchlight crews has already been expressed in memoranda and letters and at the Political Resident's meeting. The Management feel that they should take no further steps in the matter until they are accurately informed about the extent and duration of your need. If you can give them this information they would be in a position to make such arrangements and dispositions as lie in their power; but 1 must stress that any assistance in manpower that they do or will offer is temporary and may have to be frequently adjusted to meet the Company's own requirements. However, because offensive equipment is already available, but men to use them are not, the Management has re-arranged its defence and fire fighting programme so as to free some men for your use during an air raid. The following men will not be needed by the Company at the beginning of a raid, but they may be needed as soon as a raid is over. If you can arrange with these men to volunteer for duty on guns or lights and can transport them to the sites, the Company will not call for their services until the /-the raiders have passed. Messrs. Cornell, Cole, Gray, Tommey, Thompson, V/.R.Walker, T*G#Brown, Pyrah, Garlick, Sinclair, Clifford, Simpson, E. Turner. The following are on night telephone duty but.on any night five at least will be available for you in the same way as above. Messrs. Wild de Carteret J. Wright Mouatt Marsh McGregor Sutton-Wright Barry I desire to make it clear that all the men you use are only to be ,r on call ' and are not to be asked to do regular duty or to sleep elsewhere than in Awali.

Ref: S.10547/1/Air.O 8th November 1940. I have the honour to refer to your signal No.T/488, dated 26th October, 1940, and to our conversations during my recent visit to Bahrain* I have been in communication with A,0.C.-in-Chief, Middle East, and the question of anti aircraft defaaces for Bahrain has been fully considered in relation to other pressing commitments in the Middle East. 2. As you well realise, it is quite impossible, under the conditions which exist at the present time, to M lock-up M any fighter aircraft at Bahrain, as every available fighter we can spare is urgently required for operations/La the Middle East and Greece. ' 3. Regarding the provision of a full A.A. gun and search light ••lay-out'*, as requested by you, G.H.Q., Middle East are unable to spare any equipment or personnel from Middle East resources. Even with anticipated reinforcements, A.A. defences in actual operational areas will still be inade quate. You will fully realise that there are several more pressing claims than Bahrain on the resources of the riddle East Command, including the necessity for sending, at short notice, to Crete, A.A. defences for the naval and air bases which have now been established there. 4. The authorities in the Middle East consider that, whilst the possibility of further raids on Bahrain cannot be ruled out, they are now, perhaps, less likely in view of Italy’s increased commitments. A.A. defence measures which can be taken at Bahrain at the present time, cannot, there fore, be more than token defences. 5. The two A.A. guns which have recently been landed at Bahrain will provide some degree of protection. The diffi culty is the provision of crews to man them. I have sent an 'Immediate'* signal to Air Ministry to ask them if they can obtain crews from the Admiralty, War Officer, or from India. If they cannot help I am prepared , as I told you, to send some 'Iraq Levies, a few of whom may have some ex perience of gunnery - a relic of days long ago, when the Levies included a pack battery. 6. I have asked Captain Cosmo Graham to let me know the numbers which woid be required , and on receipt of his reply will arrange for the men to be earmarked ready to go tc to Bahrain at short notice if experienced crev/s are not available from elsewhere. In accordance with your suggests ion, they would be sent by air to av6id delay over exit visas, etc. I have already sent to Basrah a mobile search light, mounted on a lorry, which is to be embarked on the next ship due to call at Bahrain. It is exnected that the ship will leave Basra^ at the end of this week. This seanh- light will have to be manned by personnel of L.D.Vs, since I have no men to spare for this purpose. These must be many men belonging to the Oil Company who are fully qua lified to operate it. The Honourable Political Resident, PERSIAN GULF.- 2 7. Regarding the question of British guards specially recruited by the Company, the Air Ministry statei very de finitely in their signal X.683 of 12th January, 1940, (which was repeated to you) that they could not consider enlisting men in H.M.Forces for,this purpose. It involved 'serious difficulties', in particular those of divided control an:i the use of British Forces at the expenc of a foreign company, for the protection of private property' It is unlikely that this decision will be reversed. The alternative suggested by Air Ministry at that time has obviously failed, and I welcome your proposal to approach India and ask them to provide six British police sergeants to replace the existing guards. 8. I have called for the names of four volunteer Arab Levy N.C.Os who are willing to take their discharge and trans fer to the special police force at Bahrain. Though you did not specify ''Iraq Levies ' I presume these are the men you want. I anticipate a delay of a few weeks in obtaining the approval of the 'Iraqi Government, through the British Embassy, as it took some months to persuade them to release the ex-Levy officer Alwan. Every conceivable difficulty was placed in the way - mainly, I believe, because the 'Iraqis resented the fact that a Levy had been asked for rather than and'Iraqi policeman. However, I will adk the Emjfbassy to do their best to hurry this matter up. I presume that tra velling expenses from Basrah will be paid by the Bahrain Government. Also that free accommodation and rations at Bahrain will be provided for these men, and that, as in the case of the officer already suoplied, their existing rates of pay will be subject to an increase of 25% frmm the date of their embarkation at Basrah. One of the recommendations made by my representative, Major Rose, after his visit to Bahrain at the beginning of tha yaar October, was that some link was definitely required between the native officer Alwan and the 'other ranks' of the police, and I am only too anxious to find suitable men for this purpose. 9. Major Rose also tells me that he asked the Political Agent (Mr. Weightman), to press the Bahrain Government to increase the strength of the special police force as, with only 110 men, the duties were so heavy as to preclude effi ciency and any chance of training. I am glad to note that the Bahrain Government now intends to increase this force to 160, which should suffice. 10. Regarding the L.D.Vs, I would be glad if you would tell the Political Agent that we have asked higher authority (a) if Americans can be enrolled, (up to about 20). (b) If a Havildar instructor can be sent to Bahrain from India so that one or more Indian platoons can be enrolled, (up to about 50 men). and (c) If an assistant British Junior N.C.O. Instructor can be sent from India to assist the present permanent staff instructor who, owing to the difficulties of shifts, is nov; somewhat overworked This is in accordance with suggestions made by the Political Agent to Major Rose on 12 October. There has been some delay in obtaining equipment for this force but this matter is gradually gi righting itself, and I hope that the L.D.Vs will soon become a real live force In coneludion, I would like to say how much I regret 11 .- 3 - ble to meet your requirements, except in a very slight degree, but, unfortunately, the resouraes at our disposal in Middle East will not permit of this at the oresent time• possi 12. I would be glad if you would explain the situation to Mr. Lipp. I am sending a xopy of this letter to the A.L.O. and S.N.O., P.G. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your obedient servant, H.G.

I then had a day, v/hich subsequently became tv/o days to spare before the next eastbound plane and so went to Baghdad. There I talked to the American Minister about the possibility of enlisting Americans in the Volunteer Defence Force. He was enthusiastic, provided of course that they are not called on to take any oath of allegiance, and he advised me to 'go ahead' without any official reference being made, since an official reference would involve his addressing the State Department in Washington with con sequent delays. I asked him what would happen if we had to deal with an American subject for breach of discipline and he said we need not worry about that, provided we did not actually shoot him ls (Original at page 102 of file 28/l-K) Extract from Tour Notes - Bahrain (December 1940) received from A.H.O.

Copy of a letter from me to the Bahrain Petroleum Company, 3. The Company’s reply. The attendance of volunteers at pprades has been steadily decreasing, and now numbers about 6 to 8 on an average at evening peradee.

Haj or R*G *11 .Alban, Political Agent, Bahrain.\ BY Aid MAIL S £ C R B T EXTERNAL AFFAIRS DEPARTMENT, D .0. No «D ,550l-N/41. New Delhi, The ^ November 1941. We have just seen with some surprise that the Bahrain Volunteer Defence Force is to be disbanded. We observe that the reasons for this are that with the arrival of British forces in Iraq there has been a great falling off in keenness among the members of the ^tt!ai«bBfl39cx&gt;fc&gt;tbec Force and in numbers attending parades. The announcement by the Bahrain Petroleum Company that they will not give benefits to the dependants of men killed or injured in defence duties seems also to have had some effect, though the general spirit cannot have been particularly good if *-v this is in fact one of the main reasons. 2. Bahrain is of course a potential enemy target of extreme vulnerability, and there are in the island well over 200 able bodied Englishmen and a good many Americans. It seems altogether wrong that these men should do nothing in the way of self-help and unless there is some A.R.P. organisation already in being it would seem desirable that the cjiestion of creating such an organisation employing every possible able-bodied Britisher and American in the island, whether men or women, should be seriously considered. It might perhaps be argued that the creation of an A.R.P. organisation in Bahrain would cause alarm and despondency locally, but such an argument can be very largely discounted by the fact that similar action is taken in India without any undue alarm being exhibited in any quarter. Homoeopathic doses, moreover, are sometimes the best treatment. 3. Nor does there seem to be any reason why the Americans should not take their part in A.R.P. work, and we should be glad to know in due course whether any difficulty is being experienced in obtaining American co-operation in active A.R.P. measures, in manning posts, and so on. If there is, we should be prepared to consider taking up the matter through Sir Girja Shankar Bajpai, the new Agent General for India in Washington, with a view to enlisting the interest of the State Department in influencing the parent Companies. 4. The main point is to eradicate the apparent spirit of apathy and helplessness now obtaining in Bahrain and at the same time to ensure that British and American residents of the island do in fact fit themselves for useful service in an emergency. There is no intention of withdrawing the Defence Officer as his services are still required in connection with th the work of the Anti Aircraft Deto.ehment, and you will no doubt find it useful to discuss the whole question further with him and with Alban.

Letter No.Def/Air/S/6 dated 17th July 1941 from the Defence Officer, Persian Gulf, with enclosures. 2. Bahrain telegram No.275 dated 5th August 1941.As regards the questions raised by Mr. Weightman concerning the disbandment of the Bahrain Defence Volunteers, this matter was given very careful consideration by myself in consultation wit a Brigadier Hughes last July when he was here on Persian Gulf Reconnaissance in his role as Brigadier Designate of the Persian Gulf Command. He represented the matter in a report to General Headquarters in India in which he stated his opinion of the Bahrain Defence Volunteers. r, It is of value in teaching local Europeans to handle a rifle but is of no value as a military force, as in the event of a disturbance the majority of the volunteers could not be spared from key positions in the Gil Field. The Unit cannot be given a definite role in defence and it is questionable whether this Unit is worth the time, equipment and instructional staff employed on it'*. Following this up was a letter sent by me which is in your possession, dated July 17th recommending the disbandment of this Unit. Although the unit has not technically been disbanded yet this is merely due to a matter of internal communication between General Headquarters in India and Air Headquarters, Iraq and perhaps Air Ministry in England who Originally sanctioned the formation of this Unit. General Headauorters, India, now come into the matter owing to the fact that land defences in the Persian Gulf have been taken over by General Headquarters in India from Air Headquarters, Iraq in August. For practical purposes the disbandment has been accepted in so much that Air Head quarters have withdrawn all arms, equipment and ammunition which was reported in my monthly operational records, a copy of which was sent to you, for September$ that is so far as the situation stands at the moment.2 - The reasons for the disbandment of this Trnit have been stated on move than one occasion and to clear them up I add the following notes : In W6. Weightman’s letter he states that there are over 200 able bodied Englishmen and a good many Americans. This statement is open to the following criticism. Of the 200 so-called able bodied Englishmen at least 50 per cent of these are either elderly or are employed in such posi tions that in the event of being called to arms they will not be available. As regards Americans there are about 30 of these in the Oil Company of which the complete number are key men in the oil industry. At the moment the scale of attack visualised would be sporadic air raiding for which the role for volunteers does not exist, more especial ly as all aoA. of anti sircvaft defence now been taken over by an Indian Anti Aircraft unit. 'Vith regard to the remaining 100 able bodied Englishmen a great per centage of these are employed on shift duties while a small per centage are unlikely to be of any advantage to any military unit. From its original inception a succession of Defence Officers have made efforts to encourage the attendance of these volunteers at instructional parades with, as has already oecn stated, singularly little success. I am therefore still of opinion that the formation of a volunteer unit in Bahrain is not a practical proposition. As a result of the training taken up by the now disbanded volunteer unit, there are about 60 men who are capable of using a rifle in self defence without being a danger to the public. *bout 30 have fired a V.B. gun* But this does not make them in any way an efficient force. are divided into active and passive air defence. Active air defence is at present catered for to the limit of duties have As regards air raid precautions, these precautions \* - 3 ~ existing equipment that can be spared for Bahrain in its present position in the form of anti aircraft artillery and light automatic machine guns which are oosted so as to attempt to deal with aircraft which may attack the Befinery. Numerous reports on the efficiency and state of equipment of these guns have been made to the proper sources and hardly come in to these notes. Passive air defence Is the responsibility of civil and local bodies. Passive air defence of the Company* a property at Awali and in the Refinery together with fire fighting precautions are in my opinion highly satisfactory. ICO % air raid shelters approved by the Snginepr in Chief, General Headquarters in India, are available. As regards Manama and other totns in the Island I am unable to give any definite information but it might be worth considering whether a comprehensive Passive Air Defence scheme should not be considered. The difficulties are fully realised. O In conclusion it may be stated that General Headquarters in India have intimated that as a result cf the Persian Gulf Reconnaissance held here last July under the leadership of Brigadier Hughes a comprehensive scheme for the defence of the Persian Gulf including Bahrain has been fully con sidered as and when the occasion arises. A further note regarding the volunteers. A very large proportion of the volunteers who are not actually engaged on production or maintenance work in the course of an air raid have jobs allotted to them in connection with Passive Air Defence measures and fire fighting. Dictated by s Major H.T. Hewitt f M.C. 28th December 1941. Defence Officer, Persian Gulf.Confidential D.O. 0/ 253E-SF. Bahrain, Jany 2, 1942. Dear Alban, With reference to your question about anti-air-raid precautions in Bahrain, the following measures have been taken by the government. 1. A black-out has been imposed in Man amah and Muharraq. Street lights are no longer used with the exception of a few at dangerous corners which are suit ably screened. The lamps of all cars have been dimmed. Regulations have been issued requiring householders to screen their windows and to desist from showing naked lights. The black out has however been relaxed lately but it can be tightened up at any time should circum stances render it necessary. 2. A number of trenches have been dug inside and ^ on the edge of Manamah town where the ground is soft enough to allow digging. Two long deep drains which were constructed after last year T s abnormal rain on the west and on the south east side of Manamah town have been kept open in order to afford protection in case of air raids. Both the trenches and the drains v/hich are 4-5 feet deep are not roofed but would provide satis factory shelter against all but a direct hit. It is estimated, roughly, that about 5000 persons could be accommodated in the trenches and the open drains. The public have been given advice as to what they should do in case of an air raid, people on the sea front have been recommended to enter the sea, those on the edge of the town to go into the gardens and warnings have been2 - been given against sheltering under buildings which are liable to collapse. The local paper has been used to give publicity to these measures. 3. The State Police, stationed in the Port and the Manamah and Muharraq Police Stations have orders as to what action to take in case of air raids. It is a assumed that an actual raid would take only a few minutes and the duty of the police would be to guard certain points against attempts to loot, to render assistance to victims injured by bombs or by falling buildings, to prevent panic and to control fires. In the opera tions of the police it is assumed that the use of motor vehicles inside the town will be impossible so the police will go on foot to their various posts. 4. The two fire engines, which are always kept in a state of readiness, with drivers and staff on the spot, would be available in case of fires. Barasti huts, which are decreasing in numbers in Manamah and Muharraq are very inflammable but stone houses do not burn easily. The majority of the houses in the two towns are of stone. In Manamah and Muharraq there are numbers of artesian wells. Those in Manamah have been provided with small tanks, specially made for the use of the fire engines so that they can refill at different points in the town. It has been found from past expe rience that the local population co-operate keenly and intelligently in case of fires and there is never any shortage of volunteers for helping to put out fires or to demolish barasti huts which are adjacent to burning buildings. The band of the State Police has been trained as a fire squad and also in first aid work and in case of an air raid half of the band works with the —3—the fire engines and the remainder report to the hospital to work as stretcher hearers, 5. An air raid alarm worked hy electric power has been manufactured and can be fitted to the roof of the Kanoo building close to the Customs Square, which is in the centre of Manamah town. This building has three stories and is considerably higher than the surrounding houses. The alarm consists of a number of motor horns on a frame and the sound can be heard from a long dis tance. It is more effective at night and probably if an air raid ocurred in the daytime it would not be so necessary. 6. Telephone operators in the Manamah exchange have orders in case of an air raid or similar emergency to restrict calls to certain persons including police posts, hospitals etc. etc. 7. The Manamah-Muharraq bridge is a point which would probably be attacked. A direct hit on the bridge would render it useless, a direct hit on the causeway would only do temporary harm which could be repaired in a day. The State has no means of defending the bridge from air attack but from a strategical point of view even the distruction of the framework of the bridge would be of minor importance because a temporary struc ture capable of carrying cars could if necessary be erected. 8. An emergency medical aid scheme has been pre pared and practised several times. All the medical authorities in Bahrain have cooperated in planning the scheme and in making available the services at their disposal. The personnel consists of English, American andlndian doctors and nurses, dressers, trained police-4- ( *v police and the hospital ambulances. Units operate from two base hospitals, the government hospital and the Mission hospital and both hospitals are equipped to carry out treatment and operations on any casualties. Two ambulances ef‘ four private cars are detailed for this work. The medical equipment for use in air raids is kept ready day and night and during recent months the scheme has been tested by night alarms and has been found to work satisfactorily. 9. The steps which have been taken against pos sible air raids apply mostly to Manamah. It is thought that raids would most likely be directed against Manamah which contains buildings which would be more likely objectives than anything which exists in Muharraq such as the Fort, the Power Station, the Customs Sheds, Oil Stores, Wireless Stations and Government offices. Muharraq consists entirely of residential areas and apart from the aerodrome there is nothing there that sould possibly be regarded as a military objective. The Bahrain Petroleum Company has its own organisation and arrangements for dealing with air raids. The Company’s arrangements do not depend upon the facilities which the Bahrain Government has available but if called upon by the Company the Government fire engines and medical services can be used. 10. Until now no air raid wardens have been appointed. It was considered sufficient for the Police, the Medical Authorities, Municipal Authorities and the State Engineer’s staff to know what they had to do in a case of an air raid. Until the possibility of an air raid becomes a probability I am doubtful whether appointing air raid wardens among the local population Such action would certainly cause people —5- is desirable-5- people to think that air raids were expected. It is essential that air raid wardens should be Arabic speak ing persons otherwise they would be almost useless in time of* emergency. When the progress of* the war makes it seem more likely that Bahrain may be attacked I sug gest that the government should appoint a number of air raid wardens chosen from the long resident Indian population and some of the local Arabs. These people could be given instructions on what to do and how to cooperate with the government services. Unfortunately we have none of the appliances available which are used in England for fire fighting such as stirrup pumps etc nor is there a town water supply which would be useful in case of fire. 11. The opening of the bridge makes it possible to extend A.R.P. work to Muharraq. I am suggesting that the Emergency Medical Scheme should now embrace Muharraq and the State Engineer is already working on a scheme for building fire engine filling tanks in Muharraq as has been done in Manamah. Unfortunately many of the streets in Muharraq are too narrow to allow the fire engines to pass and much of the ground is too hard to allow trenches to be constructed. In Muharraq however the area of saf houses is mostly at one end of the town and can be reached by the new wide sea road. 12. My suggestions for the future are to take similar steps in Muharraq as have been taken in Manamah, to dig trenches where possible, to provide water supplies for fire engines and to extend the medical scheme to Muharraq. Later, when it seems likely that air raids -6-raids may occur, to appoint and teach air wardens for duty in Manamah and Muharraq. and to carry out practices by night and by day with alarms, medical services and police and municipal authorities tak ing part in them, but when this is done the local population will certainly gain the impression that raids are likely to occur. Yours sincerely, Major R. G. S. W. Alban, O.B.E., H.B.M’s Political Agent, Bahrain.-- jr 4 SBCHST D*0* No. C/1 Political Agency, Bahrain, the 1st January, 1942. Reference your demi-official letter No. 146-S dated the 12th December, 1941, and enclosures. 2. Final sanction to the proposal for disbandment of the Defence Volunteers has not yet been received but the arms and equipment were withdrawn by Air Headquarters, Iraq, and despatched to Basra on the 30th September, 1941. I have no relevant papers subsequent to my telegram of 4 5th August. 3. I showed the letter to Hewitt who has written a note on the facts which I append herewith. When I arrived here, just after the air raid in October last year, the Volunteer Defence Force was already in being but the, then, “v Defence Officer complained that in spite of his efforts attendance was very unsatisfactory. Colonel Prior held a meeting at the Awali Club at which about 60 representative men were present. He answered questions on points which had apparently been worrying the men and spoke to them on the war situation generally. I was also there. In the next few months we managed to increase the enrolment figures from some 55 to 100 but the actual turnout on parades always remained disappointing. 4. I know personally that Byard spared no effort to make the scheme a success. After him came Chadwick who also tried very hard but without much result. Hewitt, when he took over as Defence Officer, provided every facility /- The Honourable Lieutenant-Colonel W. R. Hay, C. I. E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire . ifacility to make it easier for the men to attend; instruc tional parades were held two and three times a day to suit people coming off different shifts, competitions were orga nised and all the usual means employed for stimulating interest and encouraging attendance. But there was little response and when Hughes was here in July he lived at Awali for some time and was able to study the situation on the spot. From what he saw he came to the conclusion that the force, of which only a very small number could be available in case of necessity, was not worth keeping up. 5. There is no doubt, however, that given the right spirit most of the men could have acquired a good knowledge of the use of the weapons provided; but their attitude may possibly be due to the nature of their work ?/hich consists largely in attending to machinery and plant of various kinds, a very trying job in summer. Many are on night shifts and have to take their rest in the day time. It is not correct to say that there are 'well over 200 able bodied Englishmen and a good many Americans in the Island'. Actually today, there are 150 English and 20 Canadians in Awali, and 20 English in Manama. This includes people like Belgrave, de Grenier and Campbell of Gray Mackenzie who cannot be expected to attend. There are 30 Americans at Awali which includes Lipp and other heads. One of them is over 60. 6 . The sudden discontinuance of the Defence Force by the military authorities was a great disappointment but, in view of the unsatisfactory way in which it has functioned from the very beginning I much doubt whether it would be worth reviving it, at least under present conditions, or whether it would justify the employment of instructors and provision of arms and equipment* 7. The Defence Officer has sufficient work to do in superintending the duties of the Special Police which incidentally /-incidentally, are much more efficient now than ever before, 2 British officers and some 70 Indian ranks. A sufficient amount of office work is also involved in dealing with pay, equipment, etc., and correspondence with the Army and Air Headquarters and the Oil Company. The Defence Officer is also attending to the duties previously performed by the Air Liaison Officer. 8. A.R.P. in Awali and the Refinery is organised in full and the Defence Officer. It provides for fire fighting, for which there exists very complete and up to date equipment in the shape of trucks, pumping plant and hoses; f to injured, arvi both Awali, the Refinery and the I employees* camp are fully provided with the most u and approved type of air raid shelters. Air raid have been appointed and air raid alarm signals hav installed, a certain number of women would take t 9. As regards Manama, I attach a note on A.R.i by Belgrave. The most important measures are the organisation, fire fighting and the A.R.P. trenche were recently constructed under the advice of the Defence ^ detail, copies of the scheme are with the Company officials in first aid work, attending to children, etc.4 - backward in doing what they could. But this condition is not a new one and was already in existence when I first came here, as reported by Byard, and obviously dated beck to the very start. It is also correct to say that defence and A.R.P. arrangements hardly existed a year ago. Last year the special police were so bad that the Refinery and other plant were virtually unprotected, which is very far from being the case now. The special police are now a useful, well disciplined, semi-military force. There v'as no A.R.P. organisation in Manama, no trenches, no medical organisation, no black-out anywhere in the Island and no anti aircraft defence. The present arrangements as detailed above and also in the notes by the Defence Officer and the Adviser represent what it has been practi cally possible to do during the last year or so, and ex tensions and improvements are being carried out all the time • 11. Reference paragraph 4 of your demi-official letter. The recent entry of dapan into the war has not aroused any noticeable keenness in Awali to join the Defence Force and a reviving of the project would, I am afraid, under present conditions probably lead to a recurrence of the s-.me difficulties which have already been experienced. 12. I hope that copies of this correspondence can be shown to Colonel Prior, who took a keen interest in the defence and A.R.P. arrangements and who may have something to add to this.

Please refer to oorrespondence ending with my demi- official letter No.44-8, dated the 14th January 1942. 2 . I have discussed this case at considerable length with Lipp, Wakefield and others. Lipp states that since the hefence Volunteers were first raised the number of the Company’s American and European employees has dropped from 250 to about 185. Out of these 100 are employed on Bnifte every night. With the best will in the world not more than 20 or 50 would be able to turn out on parades on holidays. Further, in the event of an emergency every man would be required for some special purpose in the Camp or in the Refinery area and none would be available for general defence purposes. 5. The military authorities, too, are not keen on the revival of the Force| they consider that in the event ol an emergency the men would be more usefully employed on their particular jobs ir. the Refinery or elsewhere and that the rifles which would have to be re-allotted if the lefence Force were revived are better used elsewhere. 4 .
