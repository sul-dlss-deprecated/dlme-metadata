V Your telegram No. 1167 January 16th. Bushire - Bahrain cable was laid in 1935 without consent of Persian Government and possibility that they could make themselves unpleasant about it was realised vide your letter No PZ 5071 August 20th 1936. There are therefore strong objections to its restoration (a) on ground mentioned above (b) it may provoke Persian Government to revive claim to Bahrain, which is last thing we desire and (c) it would prejudice negotiations (if not concluded, as to which I have no information) for renewal of Company*s concession in Persia (Tehran despatch 186 June 5th 1945 to Foreign Office;. 2. Persian Government’s permission obtained in 1942 for Company to operate emergency wireless link between Bushire and Bahrain was limited to duration of war. If negotiations mentioned in preceding paragraph have not been successfully concluded have Company taken separate steps to secure extension of permission ? ND?

Your telegram No.91 cables* y. /■ January 19th. Persian T1 2. Cable &amp; Wireless state that new concession has been agreed to in principle subject to Customs exemption points, and is expected to be signed shortly. It permits Cable k Wireless (a) to continue to maintain and operate cables at present landed at Bush ire {oi to establish, install, maintain and operate in future such additional cables at Bushire as Company may require (c) to continue to maintain and operate at Bushire the Company's emergency wireless apparatus on the understand ing that it is used for no other purpose than for oommunioation during cable interruptions unless permissio is given by Persian Government. I understand Bushire end of Bahrain-Bushire cable is still led in to Rushire cable station and that rejoining it would take place outside territorial waters. 3. Provided Cable k Wireless take no action to rejoin Bahrain-Bushire cable until concession has been actually signed clauses (a) and (b) above appear between them to dispose satisfactorily oi points (a) and of your telegram. Do you consider that likelihood of the Persian Government using it ae occasion for reviving claim to Bahrain would remain if Company postpones taxing of action proposed until after concession has been signed. 4. From point of view of improving through cable communication advantages appear considerable. 5 # ?
