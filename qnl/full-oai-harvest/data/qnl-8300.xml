Amendments to the regulation were thought necessary in order to authorise the Political Agent, Bahrain, to marry non-British subjects (The Christian Marriage (Amendment) Regulation, 1946) and those who were resident in Saudi Arabia (The Christian Marriage (Amendment) Regulation, 1948). Discussion of the need for and wording of the amendments occur in exchanges between officials at the India Office, Foreign Office, Government of India (External Affairs Department), and the Political Residency in the Persian Gulf.Also included in the file is correspondence concerning similar questions in Kuwait, namely, whether the Political Agent is able to solemnise the marriage between foreigners or non-Christians (folios 87-98). A copy of The Kuwait Order in Council, 1935 is included for reference purposes.A copy of The Indian Christian Marriage Act, 1872 (XV of 1872) is also contained in the file (folios 16-39).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival item</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Persian Gulf Political Residency</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Indian Political Service, External Affairs Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000602.0x000370#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
