Enclosure Political Review of Iraq for the Year 1946 I. —General During 1946 Iraq shone like a good deed in a naughty world, maintaining peace within its frontiers, amity with its neigh bours and cordiality for its ally. Except for two small incidents—a demonstration in Bagdad and a strike in Kirkuk— security has been absolute. II. —Domestic Affairs 2. When the year opened there was a general expectation that political life, stagnant for so long under the exigencies of war, would revive. It was hoped that, as the result of the Regent’s public announcement on 26th December, 1945, political parties would once more come into being and that elections would be held in accordance with a new Electoral Law. Oppressed by criticism in the Majlis, Hamdi al Pachachi, then Prime Minister, • resigned in February and a new Cabinet was formed by Tawfiq Suwaidi. This plausible but shifty politician included in his Cabinet a number of “ new men,’’ which was encouraging; but with one exception they proved to be enemies of promise. Far from holding elections, Tawfiq Suwaidi was unable even to hold his Cabinet together, though he did succeed in passing the new Electoral Law. In order to divert attention from the anfractuosities of his own intrigues and in a bid for popularity, Suwaidi removed all the war-time restrictions on the press and on public assembly. Irresponsible agita tors at once took advantage of this. Tawfiq, seeing that he was unable to get the djin back into the jar, raised a factitious clamour regarding treaty revision. This evoked remarkably little response from the general public; so, finding his store of political nostrums exhausted, Tawfiq resigned at the end of May, insinuating that his continuance in power had been made impossible by the Regent, to whom Tawfiq is, as His Royal Highness is aware, disloyal. 3. The choice of a successor was difficult. Once again efforts were made to form a genuine caretaker Government whose task would be to hold elections, and once again the experiment failed. Arshad al Umari, formerly Lord Mayor of Bagdad and later Foreign Minister, became Premier. Most of his Ministers were men of straw, who were prepared to leave affairs entirely in Arshad’s impulsive hands. Arshad had been a most successful lord mayor and had improved Bagdad by the same methods of enlightened dictatorship as the Prince Regent improved London. But a regime which can be successfully applied to bricks and mortar may lead to disaster when employed on human beings. With reactionary zeal, Arshad set out to repress what he conceived to be the licence which had been stimulated by his predecessor; a witch hunt of “ reds ” started throughout the country, editors were prosecuted, officials discharged and favours distributed at the sole whim of the Prime Minister. General resentment was naturally aroused by this proud and violent behaviour, and was increasingly directed not only against the Prime Minister but against the Regent and this embassy, who were supposed to be maintaining “the dictator” in power. Like his predecessor, he attempted to divert public opinion from his failure. He 85-1632 produced what he called a five-year plan, but nobody took it seriously. 4. At the end of November the Arshad Cabinet fell and, after much hesitation, Nuri Pasha was again asked to form an election Cabinet. This he did, and yet a third attempt to hold elections was thus inaugurated by the most able statesman in the country. Nuri Pasha took the novel step of inviting the two chief political parties, the Liberals and the National Democrats, to nominate members to his Cabinet. Both parties agreed, on written condition that the elections should be free. Within a month, however, the coalition had collapsed. The representatives of the two political parties complained, not without justice, that the Shia Ministers in the Cabinet were trying to manipulate the elec tions for their own ends, and resigned. On the last day of the year the resignation of the two Shia members was also accepted. To save face, it was announced that they had withdrawn in order to be free to con duct their election campaign. It was, nevertheless, apparent that what had started as a party difference on 20th century lines had resolved itself into a Sunni-Shia fission, and revealed once again the basic weakness of the country : now, as one thousand years ago, “ in every profes sion which allowed room for two persons, the one was a votary, the other an antago nist, of AH” (Gibbon). 5. Thus, throughout the year domestic politics have been stagnant. No new Parliament has been elected, no budget passed. Nevertheless, with the two small exceptions noted in paragraph 1, the peace has remained unbroken. There have been no troubles in Kurdistan or on the Euphrates. As regards the former, recent events in Azerbaijan and the fact that many of Mulla Mustafa’s adherents have returned to Iraq as hunger-bitten suppli ants, have damped the ardour of the most enthusiastic rebels. But on the Euphrates the fires of fanaticism still smoulder behind the black veils of Najaf and Kerbala, whose sterile and greedy hierophants are ever ready to exploit religious antipathy and racial hatred. III.—External Affairs 6. Politically, Iraq is extrovert. During the past year she has played an increasingly prominent part in international life. As regards the Arab League, the rash and unauthorised utterances of Azzam Pasha on such subjects as evacuation of British troops from Arab countries are deplored here. So is the disposition of certain mem bers of the Arab League to exploit it in their own personal interests, or in those of renegades such as Amin Husseini, the former Mufti of Jerusalem, who is regarded in Iraq as an enemy of the State^^^ second only to Rashid Ali. But Iraq its international responsibilities seriously &gt;4 and has never permitted personal or dynastic differences to come before national or regional interests. In Rashid AH’s case great indignation was naturally felt that King Ibn Saud should have harboured this avowed traitor, but here, again, the interests of Iraq prevailed over personal resentment. Iraq has cultivated good rela tions with Turkey, with whom an economic agreement was concluded during the year. Nuri Pasha also laboured to induce a Syrian-Turkish rapprochement. His efforts seemed to promise well, but by the end of the year the negotiations had come to a standstill, because (according to Nuri) the Turks had intimated that, if the ques tion of the Hatay were put forward in a form which called upon them to make any concessions to Syria, Turkey would raise the question of the whole of her southern frontiers—a hint to Iraq that there might be some points on the Iraq-Turkish frontier which Turkey would like adjusted in her favour. Iraq has taken a prominent part in the Palestine discussions. For economic, no less than religious and political reasons, she is deeply concerned over their outcome. 7. Iraq’s relations with Great Britain have been completely satisfactory. The official confidence and the personal cordi ality which have marked them of recent years were maintained and strengthened. The raising of the Iraqi Legation in London to the status of an embassy naturally gave pleasure, as did the eleva tion of the Emirate of Transjordan into a kingdom. Iraq’s election to the Trustee ship Council of the United Nations was regarded as putting the seal on the country’s status in world society. 8. There has been little disposition in Iraq to follow the example of Egypt in demanding the evacuation of British forces, nor has the frothy nationalism of Syria found any following here. There are, of course, those who hate us. They are noisy but so far insignificant. On the other hand the number of those who, like Nuri Pasha feel that the future of Iraq, like its past, is indissolubly bound up with the fortunes of Great Britain are many, though few of them have Nuri’s courage in pro claiming their belief as an article of political faith.3 £ the 9. The credit for this state of affairs must in large measure be assigned to the Regent. He was again in England for several months this summer, together with the young King. There is no doubt that Royal Highness has a great admira- ti&lt;Sh and liking for Britain and for British methods and persons. His cars, his air craft, his clothes, his hunters, his fox hounds, even his swans, are British, and so are many of his closest friends. The influence he exerts on politics and adminis tration in Iraq is all-pervading, if often unseen. He is still shy, and suffers from the introvertive melancholia of his house; but he has made strenuous and largely successful efforts to overcome this defect. He often carries procrastination and inde cision to almost Elizabethan lengths, but in the end he generally comes down on the side of prudence and progress. The only Iraqi statesman in whom he has real confi dence is Nuri Pasha, and in this he shows wise judgment. If this combination can be continued, and provided that His Majesty’s Government does not attempt to coerce the Arabs of Palestine, there is reason to hope that Iraq in 1947 may be as tranquil as in 1946, and that, with the elec tion of a new Majlis, political life may proceed on sound and productive lines.l}+ l f&amp;i* tl /yp r ' 4.11.46.

I HAVE read with great interest Mr. Shone's despatch No. 39 of t} 16 27th February about Communist activity Th the* Lebanon and, with reference to the point raised in his last paragraph, have the honour to state that while there is some evidence that Communist literature in Armenian is reaching Iraq from the Levant, there is none that Arabic literature of this kind is entering the country through the same channels or, indeed, from any outside source except, of course, through Kurdistan where the frontier is wide open to penetration of this and other kinds. There is still no evidence of propagandist activity by the Soviet Legation, and external guidance to the Iraqi Communists seems for the time being to be confined to the emanations of Moscow radio. 2. In this connexion I have sought the views of the British Technical Expert in the Iraqi C.I.D., who has kindly furnished me with a copy of a review of the extent and activities of communism in Iraq which he has just compiled at the request of the new Minister of the Interior, and of my specialist staff. The resultant information enables me, in continuation of Mr. Thompson’s despatches Nos. 398 and 403 of the 26th and 28th December last, to reply to your despatch No. 89 (E 797/797/65) of the 4th March. 3. The only new facts which have emerged from this enquiry are that there is strong evidence of an underground Communist party in this country, run on orthodox lines, and that the police have so far been unable to ascertain definitely either the location of its central headquarters (although the locations of some of the cells are known) or the names of the central committee. There is evidence that the army (but not as yet the police force) is slightly affected by “Communist” ideas, and a circular has just been issued by the Iraqi Ministry of War to all army commanders ordering that their officers should ensure that all ranks understand that it is forbidden to join political parties and instructing them to keep a watchful eye on any signs of such activities. 4. In this country, as in others, the terms “Communist,” “bolshevik,” “reactionary,” Fascist,” Imperialist,” and so on, have lost most of their original significance and have become mere terms of abuse to be directed against persons holding political views different from those of the user. For this reason, the head of the C.I.D. has divided the persons generally spoken of by the ruling class as “ Communists ” into four approximate categories :— (a) Educated people of liberal outlook who wish to see an improvement in the standard of living of the poorer classes. (5) A small group of people well versed in Communist literature and the language of international communism, several of whom have spent some years in Russia. . ...... . {c) Half-educated young men, with time on their hands, who have no clear understanding of the issues involved and who work off in leaflet distribution and similar activities the feeling of frustration and inferiority which their upbringing has engendered. i • i i • (d) Manual workers who are (justifiably) discontented with their wages and working conditions and who are, for the first time, becoming aware of the power which their number gives them. 4. The reasons why the progressively-minded and the discontented turn to communism are not far to seek. In the first place, they have seen the mateiial success of the great Soviet experiment, which madb possible the Russian victories of the late war; they are fully aware that the Government of their own country is in the hands of' a selfish ^ oligarchy, and to them Russia is what revolutionary France was to early 19th-century Liberals. Secondly, there is in this country an ineradicable belief that the British stand behind the ruling class, opposed' to social progress and, through the British advisers and this [76—91]embassy, are “ running the country '; those who wish to see social dhanges tend, therefore, automatically to turn to the only Power which now appears likely to challenge the British position in the Middle East. Many of the Russophils of to-day are the Germanophils of the days before El Alamem. 5. “ Communist activity ’' in this country is still legally an offence against the Crown, but it is the opinion of the C.I.D. that it has now reached a level at which it can no longer be either ignored or suppressed. The Government, however, do not yet seem to have formulated a policy for dealing with thp—^ situation, which they regard with increasing alarm. In governmental circles the main reaction against the growth of communism has been towards a desire for British support. This tendency is repeated in other quarters, and we have acquired some rather questionable friends among the wealthy and timorous. From these the cry goes up : Why are the British doing nothing? Another and more sinister reaction has been the emergence of a Nationalist party on familiar Fascist lines whose “leader,' Dr. Sami Shawkat, inveighs in his daily paper, Al Ba’ath al-Qawmi, against communism, Russian and British imperialism, foreigners in general, and particularly, foreign (i.e., British) employees of the Iraqi Government. Incidentally, the Left-wing press have seized on Dr. Shawkat’s anti-Russian remarks and accuse this embassy of giving him financial support. 6. The adjustment of British policy and propaganda to these developments presents a difficult problem. Russia and Russian methods have caught the imagination of the “ progressives,” Britain and British methods in Iraq have become identified with the present Government. The answer, both from the Iraqi and the British point of view, would be simple enough if a Government could be found capable of reforming the obvious defects of the Administration and using to the full the aid which Great Britain offers to carry out a vigorous policy of social and economic development. But this is asking too much of the Orient. It is necessary to make the best of such political talent as is available, 'which is at least not inferior to that of other Middle East countries, and to stimulate by argument, cajolement and practical assistance every constructive undertaking. This is the constant endeavour of this embassy, and progress is being made in labour legislation, education, the technical training of Iraqis and the provision of British experts. In the long run, this policy offers good chances of success in theory at least, but in practice, the march of events may be so raoid that an ostridh-like Government may be caught bending, despite constant and vigorous advice from us. 7.

Anti-British feeling is centred in those classes which are opposed to the Government for social, economic or, in rare cases, ideological reasons; that is to say, the under-privileged, the under paid and the half-educated. These groups constitute a formidable percentage of the population, but they are so far without serious political influence. One of the chief expressions of anti-British feeling is a slightly hysterical worship of an imaginary Russia—formerly it was Germany; and to this corresponds a morbid fear*of that country in the minds of the governing classes, a fear that has been stimulated by Russian activities in Persia and the establishment of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. There has been much talk about the need for a revision of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty, but there is no indication of any serious feeling of grievance, except perhaps as regards the restrictions placed on diplo- f matic representation. Relations between the Iraqi population and the British armed forces in Iraq have been excellent. II.— Interned Politics. 4. The Cabinet formed by Plamdi-al-Pachachi in August 1944, though expected to be of short life, has survived many difficulties and still shows no signs of early collapse. The sole defection this year has been that of Arshad al Umari, who resigned from the post of Minister for Foreign Affairs in August on account of criticism of the part which he played at San Francisco and because, according to his own statement, he felt uneasy at the unchecked growth of communism in Iraq and at the extravagances of the Regent during his tour in America. He has not been replaced, and the Prime Minister has held the portfolio since his resignation. The constitution of the Cabinet at the end of the year is as follows :— Prime Minister and Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs : Hamdi-al- Pachachi. Minister of Interior : Mustafa-al-Umari. Minister of Finance : Saleh Jabr. Minister of Justice : Ahmed Mukhtar Baban. Minister of Defence : Ismail Namiq. Minister of Communications and Works : Abd-ul-Amir al-Uzri. Minister of Education : Ibrahim Aqif al-Alusi. Minister of Economics : Tawfiq Wahbi. Minister of Social Affairs : Abdul Majid Allawi. Minister of Supply : Yusuf Ghanima. His Majesty King Faisal. 5. On the 2nd May the King entered his 11th year. His health has at times given cause for anxiety, owing to a recurrence of his asthma, but on the whole he has continued to make good progress, both mentally and physically. I On his public appearances his dignity and good manners are very noticeable, though in private he is still sometimes afflicted by a nervous tic. He is a versatile child, and at Christmas entertained his friends with a one-man performance, in which he recited and acted in Arabic, English and French, all delivered with complete composure. There is no doubt that he has benefited very greatly from the services of his English governess, Miss Rosalind de Ramirez. Her original contract was for one year, but she was asked to stay on for another two. She has now been replaced by a tutor, Mr. Pitt Rivers, who was chosen at the Regent’s request by Sir Louis Greig. The Regent. 6. His Royal Highness has had an active and eventful year. He has taken an intense personal interest in the reconstruction of the Iraqi army and in the suppression of the Kurdish revolt. He has paid visits to the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy and Turkey. He has launched out into industrial enterprises and has thereby brought on himself sharp criticism from leading and influential politicians. On the other hand, his prestige and popularity with the army and with the masses has increased. Mean while, it has become apparent that, although he enjoys the dignity and privileges of his position, he has no great liking for the work that he has been called upon to perform and is easily discouraged; on more than one occasion he has spoken of returning to private life.o o 7. His travels began with a visit to the United States, undertaken at the invitation of President Roosevelt. He had originally intended to leave in late spring, but the death of the President caused him to delay his departure till the latter part of May. He visited New York, Washington, Boulder Dam, and agri cultural districts of the Middle West, showing particular interest in agricultural development and the engineering works connected with it. On the 27th June he ^ left Chicago for Canada, where he made a short tour. On the 7th July he arrived in England, where he was entertained by their Majesties The King and Queen. During his visit he broadcast a talk to Iraq from the British Broad casting Corporation, inspected housing developments, visited aircraft factories, and took part in the V.J.-Day celebrations. He paid a brief visit to Germany, at the invitation of the British military and Royal Air Force authorities. On the 25th August he left the United Kingdom for France, and thence went to Italy, where he made a tour of the north and visited Rome and Naples. On the 12th September he sailed from Naples in a British warship and arrived in Istanbul on the 15th September. During his visit to Turkey he had the opportunity of establishing good personal relations with the Turkish President and leading Turkish politicians, and discussed with them outstanding Iraqi-Turkish questions. One result of these talks was the surrender of the traitor, Salahuddin- al-Sabbagh, for execution. His Royal Highness returned to Iraq in a Royal Air Force aircraft on the 21st September, and was received with popular enthusiasm. 8. Since these journeys he has acquired greater self-confidence and calm : the attitude of petulant defeatism, so unhappily apparent in the spring, has only reappeared once, and that briefly, on the occasion when he learnt of the arrival of Rashid Ali in Saudi Arabia. He remains profoundly convinced of the necessity of British assistance for the development of Iraq. Communism. 9. The Russian victories, Russian activities in Persia, the advent of a Russian Minister, and labour troubles at home, have caused the governing classes to take an even blacker view than before of the perils of communism. Super ficially there is some justification for their fears. Communism of a sort is undoubtedly on the increase. It is a subject of discussion among the small student class, and there has been a persistent flow of illicit propaganda of a professedly Communist type. The clandestine paper Al Qa'ida has appeared regularly and has achieved a fairly wide distribution, and the civil authorities have not been able to discover who is responsible for it or how it is produced. There is, more over, no doubt that a considerable section of the working classes look to Russia as a possible protector of their interests. Nevertheless, the problem is not, as yet, that of counteracting foreign penetration or the advance of an alien ideology; it is rather a domestic issue, the solution to which lies in obtaining the confidence of the underpaid and underprivileged in the desire and the ability of the Govern ment to provide better living conditions. There has so far been no evidence of any connexion between the underground Communists of Iraq and Moscow. The new Russian Legation is busying itself with observation, and has so far shown no desire to interfere in local affairs. Communism of the type now to be seen in Iraq is bred of the concentration of wealth in the hands of a few, the delays in carrying out measures of social reform, and the lack of any effective organisation of labour. The intellectual element is small. There is also a small number of self-styled Communists who are opposed to the Government for various reasons, mostly personal, and to the alliance with Great Britain. These were formerly supporters of fascism and can be relied on to rally to any country that can be regarded as a serious rival of Great Britain in the Middle East. Kurdistan. 10. At the end of 1944 the Iraqi Government were preparing to embark on a policy of conciliation in Kurdistan. It was not long, however, before Mulla Mustafa’s activities put a stop to all such endeavours, and armed conflict soon followed. The Iraqi Government failed to inflict a military defeat, but succeeded in bribing other Kurdish chieftains to drive the Mulla out of Iraq. At the end of the year, Mulla Mustafa and his men were still in Persia, where they were alleged to have been sympathetically received by the Russian military authorities. 11. The policy of conciliation involved the despatch of grain and cloth to Kurdistan, the planning of social improvements and the grant of an amnesty to the Barzanis, who had taken part in the rising of the previous year. The amnesty [76—127] b 24 was signed at the end of April and an apparently satisfactory meeting took place between the Minister of the Interior and Mulla Mustafa in the same month. Meanwhile, His Majesty’s Ambassador made it clear to the Iraqi Government that His Majesty’s Government did not regard the Kurds as a separate community, but simply as Iraqi subjects. At the same time, the Iraqi Government were advised to pursue and intensify their measures directed towards social betterment in Kurdistan, and also to give wider publicity in the press and elsewhere to what had been accomplished. The policy of conciliation was not popular in political circles in Bagdad, which favoured a punitive expedition. Nor did it content Mulla Mustafa, whose men became involved in skirmishes with the police, situation deteriorated rapidly when Mulla Mustafa, haying appointed himself arbiter in a tribal murder case, proceeded to Dohuk with an armed band, in defiance of Government orders and the advice of His Majesty’s Charge d Affaires. This action, coupled with the forcible seizure of several thousand yards of cloth from the Serai at Mergasur and the occupation by the insurgents of Government posts, finally decided the Cabinet to take action by calling on the Iraqi army to proceed without delay to the north. 12. It was some time before operations commenced. Apart from the lack of trained personnel and inadequacy of staff arrangements for a major militarv operation, disagreement arose between General Renton, head of the British military mission to the Iraqi army, and the Cabinet, regarding the plan of opera tion, which the former looked upon as militarily unsound. After some discussion, agreement was reached, with the proviso that in the event of the Ministry of Defence ordering operations which, in General Renton’s opinion, were militarily unsound or involved more than normal risks of war, the mission would not partici pate in the field. Furthermore, it was made clear to the Government by His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires that no British or Indian troops or members of the Royal Air Force would be sent to the disaffected areas to assist the Government in the event of failure of the operations. Steps were taken to evacuate the Royal Air Force Rest Camp at Ser Amadia; deputy assistant political advisers and area liaison officers were withdrawn from the scene of operations and, on the 4th September, approximately six weeks from the time of Mulla Mustafa’s demarche at Dohuk, three columns of the Iraqi army, numbering in all some 14,000 men, began to advance from Aqra, Rowanduz and Amadia. It is unnecessary to give a detailed account of the operations. Before the main advance, referred to above, a column was hurriedly, and without the knowledge of General Renton, ordered to advance from Bafistian to Sidaka. and, after suffering very heavy casualties, was only extricated from this deplorable position by the clever intervention of the Minister of the Interior, who, taking advantage of a quarrel which had arisen between Mulla Mustafa and one of his chief supporters, Mahmud Agha Zibari, bribed the latter and other tribal chiefs to join the Government forces. By the middle of October the rebels were in full retreat, thanks mainly to the Minister of Interior’s tribal irregulars, whose help prevented the campaign from dragging on through the winter. Although the Government and army had lost a certain amount of prestige, official communiques spoke of the operation as a complete success. Mulla Mustafa, defiant to the end, crossed over the frontier into the Russian-occupied zone of Persia with 2,000 followers, of whom 500 were armed. The Government made representations to the Persian and Russian authorities requesting that the Barzanis be treated as fugitives from justice and their arms be handed over to the Persian commander of the area. These representations have : so far met with no success. It is reported that Mulla Mustafa has now enlisted the support of the Russians; and the Iraqi Government fear that he has every l intention of making a counter-attack in the spring. 13. In Barzan the Government are endeavouring to carry out a policy of reconstruction and re-settlement. Compensation has been paid to owners of destroyed houses, measures have been taken to look after refugees, and grain has been distributed in some areas, but the building of a Government police post has taken priority over the building of a school and dispensary, a step which, though necessary, is not likely to influence the Kurds in favour of Iraqi goodwill. In November the Regent visited the north, where he was joined by the Ministers of Interior and Defence, and decorated members of his armed forces for their part in the Barzan operations and Kurdish chiefs who had sided with the Government. 14. But Kurdistan is still a source of grave concern. Many Kurds, while blaming the rebel leaders for bringing misery to Kurdistan, have come to regard Great Britain as hostile and now tend to look to Russia for help. The present revolt in Azerbaijan is strengthening this tendency.5 Economics. 15. Economic affairs continue to occupy a large place in the minds of the people. While merchants with visions of large fortunes and politicians with axes to grind are indignant that the end of the war has not brought them a flood of imported goods and a decrease in the cost of living, both Government and commercial circles are busy planning to take advantage of increasing ^relaxation of war-time control and availability of supply. 16. Relaxation of Middle East Supply Centre control over a wide range of commodities came into effect on the 1st January and was greeted with satis faction as a most important step towards re-establishment of normal trading practices although shortage of shipping, exchange control, and export control in the loading areas remained as considerable handicaps to free supply. With the cessation of hostilities in Europe and later in the Ear East the additions to the decontrolled list grew, with the result that a large volume of business was placed abroad. The effects of the new system became apparent in March and between that month and October licences for the supply of decontrolled commodities from the United Kingdom alone covered orders to a value exceeding £7 million of which £6 million were for goods to be delivered over a period of eighteen months. In October the Iraqi Government abolished the import licencing system in respect of all goods released from Middle East Supply Centre control which were manufactured or produced in the sterling area. In November the Middle East Supply Centre was dissolved. Its successors, the British Supply Mission (Middle East) and an American mission, now maintain control only over a short list of goods which are still in world slhort supply. 17. While some measure of success in controlling and stabilising the prices of both imported goods and local products has been achieved by the Iraqi supply authorities, it has been quite impossible, in such a comparatively primitive country, to counter the inflationary effects of British military expenditure. Ministry of Food purchases of export surpluses and shortage of imports. The cost of living having soared has therefore remained at a very high level and severe press and public criticism of the Government has naturally been unavailing. It is of some credit to the Government that inflation has been arrested. The total currency circulation throughout the year remained, with but slight fluctua tion, at ID. 41*5 million. In this country it has been found practicable only to ration tea, sugar and cotton piece-goods and the system worked more satisfactorily in 1945, particularly in respect of piece-goods. More regular supplies enabled a distribution during the year totalling over 14 yards per registered person as compared with only 4 metres last year. To ensure the procurement of some essential commodities barter agreements were concluded during the year with Palestine, Syria and the Lebanon. In this connexion the main item of supply from Iraq was livestock for which the adjacent countries had pressing need. 18. This year the Ministry of Food decided not to make a bulk contract for the Iraqi barley surplus estimated at 200,000 tons but to enter the open market. Owing to the fact that private merchants could not obtain shipping freight this policy has generally been successful and the Ministry have bought at prices ranging from 14^ to 16 dinars per ton as compared with the contract price of 19-| dinars per ton for the 1944 crop. After the end of the war, however, merchants, feeling that they would be able to ship, entered into private negotia tions with the result that deliveries to the Ministry of Food’s representative were held up and local prices soared. As shipping continued to be difficult and Argentine prices remained comparatively low, speculation died down in the latter part of the year and delivery to the Ministry has proceeded at a slow pace. 19. In 1944 it was realised that Iraq’s balances and earnings of scarce currencies were, owing to the wartime economic disequilibrium, becoming insufficient for essential imports from scarce-currency countries. Negotiations between His Majesty’s Government and the Iraqi Government were commenced in December of that year, but not concluded until May 1945, by which a scarce- currency target figure of some 14 million dollars was established within which Iraq could draw on the sterling area dollar pool to satisfy her needs during the year. Owing to the continued uncertainty of the situation negotiations were again opened in November 1945 for a fro rata extension of the agreement for three months ending the 31st March, 1946. 20. The conclusion of the Anglo-American Loan Agreement in December has given rise to the optimistic belief that dollars may become more readilv available after the expiration of the present agreement. It is well-nigh impossible' to get the Iraqis to appreciate international economic and financial complications,6 especially when these are opposed to their intense desire to exchange accumulated sterling balances for imports which they presume are more readily available in America. The task of combating criticism directed against the United Kingdom is, therefore, considerable, though it may be somewhat relieved by increasing availabilities of goods from the sterling area. 21. The two internal loans mentioned in the last report were floated in January. The first issue of ID.l million (bearer bonds of ID.10 each carrying^ 2 per cent, interest for twenty years and a further 2 per cent, in lottery prizes, both free of tax) was received with great enthusiasm and there is little doubt that another 3 million could have been floated at that time. The success of this loan being assured, the Government issued ID. 500,000 of the 3 per cent, loan (bearer bonds of ID. 100 and ID. 1,000 redeemable in three years). This was sold immediately and two further tranches of ID. 250,000 each were offered and taken up within four days. The original intention early in 1943 was that the loans should be floated as a deflationary measure, but by the time action was decided in January of this year it had been realised that, with a currency circulation which had risen during the war from 6 million to 40 million dinars, the issue of bonds amounting to ID. 2 million would have little deflationary | effect. As, however, Iraq has never before floated an internal loan the issues have an educational and experimental value and it is hoped that the way has been paved for further issues. The proceeds of the present loan are reserved for use in connexion with capital projects and there is little doubt that much more will be needed if Iraq is to engage in all the developments planned and at the same time eschew external loans. 22. The four leading banks agreed in May appreciably to reduce the rate of interest and charges on documentary credits for imports into Iraq opened in the sterling area. Later the bank discount rate for bills was reduced from 7 per cent, to 6 per cent, and the rate for loans reduced by H per cent. 23. Industrial developments and capital works schemes held in abeyance during the war have become live issues this year. A cement making plant and a cotton spinning and weaving mill, both in Bagdad, are nearing completion. Final plans have been laid for the establishment of a brewery. These projects are entirely new industries in Iraq. Progress has also been made in considerable expansion and reorganisation of the leather tanning industry. Messrs. Balfour, Beatty &amp; Co., Ltd., are constructing for the Government a new railway line from Kirkuk to Erbil a length of 68 miles and much of the material for this will be purchased from British army disposals. A revised contract has been concluded between Messrs. Balfour, Beatty &amp; Co. and the Government for the undertaking of the Habbaniyah Flood Relief Scheme which had been suspended in 1941 owing to the war. A British geologist has examined the Bekme Dam site, made a favourable report, and will supervise borings next year. Towards the end of the year a contract for the construction of a railway bridge across the Tigris at Bagdad was awarded to Messrs. Holloway Brothers, London, who are also negotiating for contracts for two further bridges required by the Iraqi State Railways. A contract for the establishment of a twenty kilowatt wireless transmitter 10 miles north-west of Bagdad has been secured by the Marconi Company who expect to engage also in further development, 24. A scheme designed to settle smallholders on the Dujaila lands, which has been under consideration for some years, was approved and put into operation in June. Each smallholder is to develop his 100 or 200 misharas (1 mishara = 2,500 square metres) according to a plan laid down by a committee. After ten years of satisfactory operation smallholders will be given freehold titles free of cost. 25. It has been stated that it is the intention of the Government to multiplv such schemes and to supply housing materials, &amp;c., to smallholders. While such developments are greatly to be desired it is considered that measures so designed by Iraqi Ministers, most of whom are large landowners, are more likely to be inspired by fear of what doctrines may infiltrate from the north-east than a spirit of democratic benevolence. Iraqi Army. 26. On the 23rd May, 1944, Major-General Renton succeeded Major-General Bromilow as Inspector-General of the Iraqi Army and head of the British Mission.' He was appointed for the purpose of reorganising the armv still suffering from the defeat of 1941 and many other ills of longer standing and making of it a force capable of taking the field successfully against any subversiveVo) / elements that might appear and of co-operating with British forces in the defence of Iraqi territory. This work involves the discovery and training of officers capable of leading armed forces, the training of the men in the use of modern weapons and other materials of war, the provision of those materials, and the establishment of conditions of service that will permit the development of an efficient fighting force. All these tasks raise serious difficulties. In the first ^ place, many of the outstandingly inefficient senior officers are very well connected ^ and there is strong opposition to any move to deprive them of their posts. There is a certain amount of talent to be found among the junior officers, but this should not be overrated. Inadequate educational facilities, the general inertness of the Middle Easterner, and the prevailing atmosphere of corruption and nepotism, ensure that in the military sphere, as elsewhere, there is a dearth of first-class material. Similarly, in instructing the rank and file in the use of modern weapons there arises the difficulty that the ordinary recruit has little knowledge of modern mechanisms and habitually neglects the normal measures to maintain them in a state of efficiency. The question of supply, since it does not lie in Iraqi hands and the Iraqi Government are willing to pay for the necessary material, would appear to be easier. Unfortunately, however, the need for armaments of all kinds in various theatres of war and the complications connected with Lease-lend have greatly delayed and impeded the supply of what is required. Only in the matter of improving conditions of service has no major obstacle been encountered, chiefly owing to the Regent’s appreciation of the need for reform. 27. Despite these obstacles, Major-General Renton has made good progress. A purge of useless officers on a fairly wide scale was successfully achieved, and with the support of the Regent, who has thrown himself wholeheartedly into the task of building up a useful army, it is to be hoped that more dead wood may be pruned away in the near future. A number of exercises in mountain country, desert and marshlands were carried out during the early summer and led to marked improvements. Unfortunately, progress had not yet reached a stage at which the army was ready to take the field in earnest when it became necessary to conduct military operations against the rebels in Kurdistan. These operations cannot be described as successful but, on the other hand, no disaster occurred and the rank and file maintained good morale. 28. As regards supplies, the outstanding need is for motor transport. Every effort has been made to arrange for an early release of the required vehicles, and it appears probable that the minimum requirements for the anticipated return match against the Kurds will be delivered in time to allow for training in advance. The financial side of the transaction is still under discussion. The difficulties that have been encountered in this field and an unhappy series of ' misunderstandings over the supply of aircraft to the Royal Iraqi Air toice have given colour to the perennial rumour that it is the policy of His Majesty’s Government to keep Iraq in a state of military weakness. 29. The Chief of Imperial General Staff visited Bagdad in November and discussed with members of the Iraqi Cabinet the question of supplies of equipment and partnership in defence. Labour Conditions. 30. The problem of securing a fair and even set of conditions for labour throughout the country has been engaging the attention of the Iraqi Ministry of Social Affairs throughout the year, together with that of avoiding wide-scale unemployment and unrest among the large number of workers (at present over 30,000) who are employed by the British army, when the latter eventually withdraws from the country. 31. Committees on which the embassy and Headquarters, Paiforce, are represented have been set up to deal with these problems, and, in addition to performing extremely useful day-to-day work, have made what will, it is hoped, prove to be a major contribution towards the betterment of social conditions in general throughout the country by preparing a scheme, which has been adopted by the Cabinet, for the establishment of labour exchanges throughout the country, with a central bureau in Bagdad whose duty it will be to observe the general trend of labour and to ensure a fair wage and a reasonable standard of industrial conditions. A British expert on labour conditions has been engaged to assist in this work, Technical Ex'perts. 32. In connexion with the industrial developments and the capital works schemes mentioned in the section of this report dealing with economics, and in8 pursuance of their general plans for social reform, the Iraqi Government have made application for many British experts and advisers. In particular they called for an engineer of international reputation to draw up a long-term plan for irrigation and agriculture in conjunction with a team of technical advisers of his own choosing. Mr. F. F. Haigh has been made available for this post, and his arrival in Iraq was expected early in the New Year. Other requests relate to health services, education, engineering, statistics, &amp;c. Two Egyptian advisers^ were also engaged, one for irrigation and the other for agriculture. ^ The Press. 33. With the relaxation of Government censorship that followed the end of the war, the press took advantage of its new-found freedom. Although the one or two of the more solid newspapers, such as Akhhar and Al Zaman continued to be sensible and friendly, most of the others published many criticisms of British policy, ranging from the thoughtful (if often mistaken) articles of Saut al A hali to the vicious yappings of ^4 Z Nida (Extreme Right) and Al Rai al A'am (Extreme Left). The main subjects have been Palestine and the revision of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty, although writers on the latter subject seldom, if ever, give specific suggestions, thus giving the impression to their readers that the treaty is more oppressive than it actually is. There was a burst of anti-French feeling at the time of the Levant crisis which produced such bombastic phrases as tc Iraqi bayonets are ready to defend Arab freedom ” coupled with a seemingly illogical complaint against the British for not inter vening sooner. The word imperialism (Al Istia’amar) now appears regularly in the hostile press, but as no specific definition of imperialism is ever given it probably does not make anyone’s flesh creep—or not much. In the later months of the year the newspapers were preoccupied with dbmestic politics and the Anglo- American Palestine Commission. A more favourable side of the Iraqi press is that a great deal of pro-British material such as commentaries on the inter national situation from the British angle and articles on British industry is regularly published. Altogether more than 4,000 words of material issued by the Embassy Public Relations Section is published daily in the vernacular press, and, whatever the reasons which prompt editors to use it (cash is not one of them since they are not subsidised in any way), it is a pleasing enough position. There are now fourteen daily Arabic newspapers (and one British-owned English- language one) and, although they have some unpleasant characteristics, they are, on the whole, better in tone than those of some other Middle East countries. 34. Throughout the year the ambassador continued to emphasise to the Iraqi Government the importance of giving adequate guidance to the press on controversial matters, internal and external. The present Director of Propa ganda is, however, such a feeble individual that it would be optimistic to hope for much success. III.— Middle Eastern Affairs. Arab League. 35. At the beginning of the year the Iraqi statesmen interested in Arab unity, and, in particular, General Nuri al Said, had good reason to hope that their aspirations would soon be given concrete form. The Alexandria protocol, signed in October 1944, foresaw an Arab Commonwealth with some degree of sovereignty acting through a council holding executive powers. When the committee, set up to draft the constitution of the league, met in Cairo in February, it rapidly became clear that these hopes were vain. Two States opposed any surrender of sovereignty by the members of the League, the Lebanon, because of her fears of being swallowed up in an expanded Iraq, and Saudi Arabia, because of Ibn Saud’s suspicions of the Hashimite family. Nuri al Said, and those in favour of a league with real power were obliged to content themselves with a centre for discussion. Iraq found herself ousted from her position as leader of the movement for Arab federation, but was powerless to prevent it. The covenant, drafted by the Preparatory Committee, was signed on the 22nd March and was ratified by Iraq in that month. 36. In spite of this disappointing start, the work of the council on the problems presented by the Levant States and Palestine, was not unsatisfactory. These problems and the league’s attitude to them are discussed in subsequent paragraphs.9 The Levant States. 37. The position at the beginning of the year was a deadlock, the irench upholding their demands for the maintenance of special rights and the States resolutely refusing to conclude any agreement on such terms. As the situation developed towards a crisis in Syria, public feeling in Iraq and especially in Government circles, became increasingly bitter against the Trench and tliere ''■was much talk of intervention and the supply of arms to the Syrian Government. Nuri Pasha, on a visit to Jerusalem, made a public statement implying that Syria had only to define her needs and Iraq would meet them. The Government, however, wisely avoided giving any such undertakings and confined themselves to sympathy and representations directed against the French : they showed throughout a good understanding of the attitude of His Majesty’s Government towards the dispute and took to heart the advice to avoid precipitate action. The Regent also used his influence as a stabilising factor. Nevertheless, when fighting broke out a dangerous situation began to develop, and the call for armed intervention by Iraq would have been difficult to resist had not order been restored in Syria by British action. This action was received with widespread thankfulness and relief, although there were many who felt that it was no more than the duty of the British Government and long overdue. At this point, the centre of discussion moved to the special meeting of the Council of the Arab League convened in Cairo on the 4th June, to which Iraq sent a delegation consisting of the Prime Minister, Tawfiq as Suaidi, and the Iraqi Minister in Cairo. The decisions of the council condemning the action of the French and the presence of French troops in the Levant States, and declaring that the league would take all necessary steps to counter French aggression, were regarded as satisfactory by the Iraqi Government. At intervals during the year the suggestion cropped up that the troubles in Syria should be used as an opportunity for advancing the old plans for a Greater Syria under Hashimite leadership. The good sense of the Regent and the Prime Minister ensured that these suggestions were not developed. 38. During the last weeks of the year attention centred upon the Anglo- French agreement for the withdrawal of troops. Palestine. 39. Towards the latter part of 1945 the Palestine problem again emerged as a burning political question. Musa Alami made two visits to Iraq during the year, and was eventually successful in obtaining the sum of ID. 100,000 as a practical contribution to the Arab offices in London and Washington. Provision has also been made in the Iraq budget for support of an Arab Land Redemption Fund, if such should finally be inaugurated. The murderous outrages com mitted by the Zionists in Palestine have sharpened Iraq's fear that any form of Jewish State in Palestine would be administered by an oligarchy of gangsters and would form a bridgehead of armed aggression against the Arab world. Nevertheless, the Government has shown great firmness and restraint m dealing with the matter. No demonstrations have been allowed and the tone of the press 1 compared with that of the surrounding countries has been commendably moderate. Despite all provocation from without and agitation from within, the Iraqi Government have shown themselves determined to maintain order and have shown fhemselves to be fully aware of their responsibility m having as their capital the second biggest Jewish city in the Middle East, Nevertheless, if His Majesty’s Government eventually decide to adopt in Palestine any policy which is widely at variance with the 1939 White Paper, the Jews of Iraq will almost certainly suffer, both in life and property. The reception c f Mr. Bevin’s memorandum of the 13th November was on the whole favourable, and in the subsequent deliberations of the Arab League the Iraqi delegation was a moderating influence. Egypt. 40. Relations with Egypt have not been good. In the first place, the v Regent does not like King Farouk, who, he says, has, on more than one occasion, \ been discourteous to him. Secondly, there is a general feeling here that, wffiereas Iraq was the pioneer both in declaring war on the Axis and in the formation of the Arab League, Egypt is now trying to thrust Iraq aside and put itself forward as the leader of the Arab wx&gt;rld, not only culturally but politically as well. Some of the statements of Abdul Rahman Azzam, secretary-general of the Arab League, have given substance to this resentment, and it cannot be denied that [76—127] . c10 the disappearance of the Minister of State’s office has given colour to the impression that the negotiations between the Arab League and the outside world, including Great Britain, are conducted exclusively through Egyptian media. 41. A grave political crisis was precipitated in February by the omission to invite either the Regent or the Amir Abdullah to meet President Roosevelt and Mr. Winston Churchill in Cairo. The fact that not only King Ibn Saud and King Farouk, but also the President of Syria, were invited to confer witl^ the two statesmen, whereas the Hashimites were pointedly excluded, nearly led l&lt;w the abdication of the Regent. Only the receipt of a gracious personal message from the King restored the situation. Saudi Arabia. 42. Relations with Saudi Arabia have not been of the happiest owing to the antagonism of Ibn Saud to the Hashimite family and the appearance in Saudi Arabia in September of Rashid Ali al Gailani, leader of the 1941 revolt, who had been sentenced to death in absentia by an Iraqi military court in January 1942. The defeat of the Iraqi plans for the Xrab League by a Saudi-Arabian/Lebanese combination has been mentioned above. The arrival of Rashid Ali in Saudi Arabia was a severe shock to the Regent personally and to the Iraqi Government. Despite the advice of His Majesty v 3 Government and the personal representa tions of the Regent and of the Amir of Transjordan, Ibn Saud has felt himself bound by the Arab code of honour to grant protection to Rashid Ali. No progress had been made towards a solution of the problem at the end of the year. United Nations. INInternational Relations. 43. The Iraqi delegation to San Francisco was headed by Arshad al Umari, then Minister for Foreign Affairs. They were assisted by Mr. H. I. Lloyd, formerly a British official in the employ of the Iraqi Government. In common with other Arab delegations they took strong exception to the provisions of the Charter relating to Trusteeship, and Arshad al Umari refused to sign the docu ment. The necessary powers were therefore conferred on Dr. Fadhil al Jamah, Director-General of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. 44. Iraq was represented at the meeting of the United Nations Preparatory Commission that took place in London at the close of the year by the Iraqi Charge d’Affaires and a secretary to the Iraqi Legation in London. United States of America. I 45. The Americans have been in bad odour with the Iraqi Government and all political circles during the past year. The Iraqis view with suspicion the American attempts to extend their economic influence in the Middle East, despite the fact that Iraq is anxious to purchase many American products, and they are bitterly indignant at the open Zionism of many leading figures in United States politics. As a result, American visitors, and to some extent the American diplomatic representatives in Iraq, are inclined to the belief that British influence is poisoning the minds of the Iraqis aganst them. 46. American attempts to persuade the Iraqi Government to set up, or allow American interests to set up, a direct radio telegraphic link between Bagdad and the United States have met with a refusal. Repeated and insistent endeavours to obtain unrestricted “Fifth Freedom” rights for United States airlines have so far resulted in nothing more than temporary and restricted con cessions to two American airlines. Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. 47. The Soviet Legation in Iraq has so far confined its activities to observa tion and some small social activity. The Minister has toured the southern provinces, maintaining a very discreet attitude. Nevertheless, all things Russian are viewed with the deepest suspicion by Iraqi politicians, and the Russian manoeuvres leading up to the establishment of an “independent” Azerbaijan touching the frontier of Iraq have caused apprehension and dismay. V.— Conclusion. 48. The most serious problem that Iraq has to face in the immediate future is one of internal security. If the Kurdish rising, which is confidently expected in early summer, can be met effectively by the Iraqi army, trained and reorganised by the British Military Mission, there is good hope of stability and progress.11 X fortunately it appears probable that, provided the necessary equipment can be made available in time, the army will be able to deal with any unaided attempt of Muila Mustafa and his followers to return to Kurdistan. Failure would create a most serious situation both for Iraq and for British interests in the Middle East and the first objective of British policy must therefore be to support the Iraqi Government in their coming difficulties. 49. Apart from this threat the situation in Iraq is not unfavourable. She has emerged from the war as the one relatively stable country in the Middle East, apart from the anachronistic Saudi Arabia. In educated circles it is generally appreciated that little hardship and practically no damage have been suffered during the war, despite an attempt to draw in by the Axis Powers; and this attempt, if it had succeeded, would have brought the country to ruin. The British attitude towards the Rashid Ali rebellion is still remembered as an almost incredible example of forbearance in circumstances where forbearance could not possibly be construed as weakness. The position of Great Britain is therefore strong, and it has further been strengthened by fear of Russia and distrust of America. 50. On the other hand, disruptive forces are at work. It is impossible for the young and educated Iraqi to reconcile the present conditions of his country, where the vast majority of a relatively small population are underfed, disease- ridden, uneducated, and miserably housed, and where even the rich man must go abroad to find a passably comfortable life, with the potential riches in agricul ture and oil of which he has become aware. The fault is to a great extent his own, but this he will never believe and he is persuaded, to a degree incomprehensible in England, that the British “run the country” and'are directly responsible for its failure to achieve satisfactory progress. Among the classes on which the future of this country depends, therefore, Great Britain is rapidly losing friends and the process is being hastened by the irresponsible accusations of imperialism that constantly appear in the press. It is of great importance that Great Britain should recover her reputation as a leader of material progress. Practical assistance in recruiting technical experts, training Iraqi technicians and crafts men (the latter are still almost entirely lacking in Iraq), together with judicious advice upon internal problems and wide distribution of carefully chosen propa ganda, appear to be the right methods, and these are being assiduously applied.\ Ao SECk^T r &lt; U- m With U. : ^ ‘ zq COPY Under Seorctary of »tat y. - ,&amp;£o'~ 1 'airs X« ^^ • f q.• ?'■ o • iis** 1 1 5 MAY 1S4S | ^44 $/4' (E 521/521/93) /cypil:^ departmental no .1 FROM BAGDAD TO FORE IA OFFIC g Sir- rri Stonehower Bird. rrr it No. 55 T3th January 1946.

Firstly, it would certainly be opposed in the press and in Parliament Secondly, they realise that for British troops to remain in Iraq would provoke Russia whose hostility Iraq is not anxious to incur. /Copies sent to Middle East Secretariat/ J •-&gt; V, ! • —'1^' r FILE COPY THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT (3i) So IRAQ.

I HAVE the honour to report that on the 9th April I was received in audience hy His Royal Highness the Regent of Iraq and presented to him my Letter of Credence and the Letter of Recall of my predecessor. 2. The ceremony followed the usual lines. The Chief of Protocol of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and his assistant called at the embassy with a mounted escort of the Royal Bodyguard at 11.15 and at 11.25 I and my staff left for the Palace. The passage of the cortege through the streets attracted considerable crowds of Iraqis of all classes who appeared thoroughly to enjoy the spectacle and applauded intermittently in a manner which was clearly unrehearsed. There were also cries of “ God give you victory ! ” I am informed by members of my staff that this show of enthusiasm, ingenuous and ragged as it was, is most unusual among these normally undemonstrative people and that it affords a remarkable illustration of the rise of British popularity that has taken place in the past four years. 3. A Guard of Honour was awaiting me at the Palace and after it had been formally inspected I was ushered into the Ambassadors’ recep tion rooini [ 65 — 12 ] i RECa. P:,l» • O, *« 1 X JUN 1 0/! 4 INDIA OFFICEi \ where I was met by the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Shortly afterwards I was received by His Royal Highness. The Regent’s reception of me was most friendly. There were no set speeches, but I told His Royal Highness how proud and honoured I felt to have been chosen to succeed Sir Kinahan Cornwallis. I realised how difficult this succession would be, but I felt sure I could count on the help of His Royal Highness and of a friendly Iraqi Government and people. I was later able to tell the Regent that, when The King had received me in audience on my appointment, he had spoken in warm terms of His Highness and had said that he was looking forward to seeing him on his return from the United States. His Highness spoke in terms of the warmest affection and admiration for The King and Queen and is obviously much looking forward to his visit to England. The Regent assured me, in conclusion, that I could count, at all times, on his friendship and collaboration. 4. At the close of our conversation I presented the members of my staff to His Royal Highness. The Oriental Counsellor, who knew him well, said that he was obviously in a good mood and had been pleased by what I had told him. We talked and laughed together for a little longer, and then withdrew and returned to the embassy. The ceremonies were well organised and passed off without a hitch. I was particularly impressed by the friendliness of the officials with whom I had conversation, including the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Presidents of the Senate and Chamber of Deputies on whom I paid formal calls during the course of the same day. 5.

XQ ' 15th January las t, the following summary of principal everffsin Iraq since that J| | 4 ^ (No. 117.) I HAVE the honour to submit, with reference to my despatch No. 28 of the 23 date. 2 . The rumours of change in the Cabinet mentioned in the second para- ' graph of my despatch under reference proved completely baseless and the Govern ment of Hamdi al Pachachi remains in office with, however, the possibility of &lt; 2 *. changes before the Regent leaves in April on his official visit to the United States. The storms which arose during the long debate on the reply to the speech from • the Throne have died away as suddenly as they came. Speeches in Parliament have recently been less concerned with personalities, have kept to the point under p \ i/jll discussion, and have been less unconstructively critical than heretofore. There » dr- is also a salutary tendency for members to ask questions on matters affecting their constituencies. One reason for the improvement of the general standard of Parlia ment is the publication of their proceedings in the press, which now has far more freedom to comment than formerly. At the instance of a group of Bagdad place-holders, the important new Liwa Administration Bill, which has been under- consideration for so long, was referred by the Chamber back to a Committee, but the Government were determined not to allow it to remain on the shelf, and it has now been passed and will shortly become law; though it will be a year before the complicated regulations necessary to give it effect can be drafted. Its general effect will be to decentralise the administration and, I hope, to revitalise the neglected provinces: 3 . One event of minor political note occurred on the 3rd February when Jamil Beg al Madfai resigned his seat in the Senate. No reason was given for this publicly, but it is generally assumed to have been due to his bitterness at being removed from the presidency of the Senate, as the result of a .plot spon sored by the Regent and Nuri Pasha. However this may be, Jamil Beg is no longer in Parliament and no serious effects have so far been observable. 4. Some weeks ago I was visited by a Shaikhly Deputy from Diwaniya Hwa who sought my opinion on a scheme which he and others of his kind were natching. This was the formation of a tribal party in the Chamber of Deputies r membership of which would be forbidden to Effendis and to those who wear the “ sidara.” I said that I saw no particular harm in the idea and the “ Parlia mentary bloc/’ as it is called, was (with the Regent’s approval) duly announced to a wondering world on the 16th February. After all the recent discussion about political parties in the press and in Parliament, one cannot but be amused that it should have been the Shaikhs, even though led by the armchair Shaikh Hassan al Suhail, who should have shown the Effendis the way. Abdul Aziz Beg al Sa’adoun, an ineffective Deputy from Basra, is the President, and Shaikh Hassan al Suhail the secretary of the bloc. Its guiding principles are stated to be loyalty to the throne, friendship with Britain and preservation of the faith of Islam. I scarcely expect that the new party will have very much influence on affairs, or indeed, that it will hold together very long. Its formation, however, as the first political party to come into existence since 1931, is worth recording. 5. There has been continued interest in Arab Unity. Nuri Pasha has come and gone from point to point with tireless zeal. His public statements have not always been happy and in private it has almost seemed as though he did not know his own mind. For all that, Iraqis in general have approved the Government’s decision to leave the handling of Arab Unity affairs very largely to Nuri Pasha, though not without some measure of protest from the Senate, which was rather hurt that it had not first been consulted on this matter. Interest in Arab unity has been sustained in the press, which has combined the usual attacks .on “imperialism” with dissertations on Palestine and Syria; but it has, at the same time, remained clear that the Arabs, like the peoples of the west, tjrffd it'hard [64—51] h2 to be united except when they are ail in opposition to some outside power or policy which they conceive menaces the Arab States individually or collectively. 6 . The meeting of King Ibn Saud and Earouk at Yenbo revealed an imme diate divergence of opinion, and emphasised the continued existence ol rival ambitions within the Arab world. Messages about this meeting were for the most part published without comment in the Iraqi press. On the other hand, the meeting of the Regent of Iraq with Amir Abdullah of Transjordan was hailed^* as an important event in Arab affairs. The Regent and the Amir Abdullah were clearly disturbed that Saudi Arabia and Egypt should show such solidarity and were apprehensive of the effects of the discussions between the two kings on Hashimite claims to Arab leadership, and perhaps also on Hashimite claims to more material things, like the throne of Syria. The press, voicing what is now, I think, the feeling of most of this country, clearly expressed its support of the House of Hashim and refrained from attaching any significance to the Farouk- Ibn Saud Conference which might appear to conflict with the interests of Iraq’s ruling dynasty. 7. The fear that Hashimite claims might be overlooked, or passed by, was unfortunately strengthened in the minds of the Regent and his Ministers when they heard that Mr. Churchill and Mr. Roosevelt had met King Ibn Saud in Egypt and had conveniently found in the same country the President of Syria. The Regent was deeply hurt at not having also received an invitation, but as I have dealt fully with Ihe resulting local complexities by telegraph, it is hardly necessary to do more than just mention the matter in this despatch. 8 . Kurdish affairs have, on the whole, been quiet during the period under report. Mulla Mustafa after some further touring seems inclined for the moment to take no initiative in attacking the Government. The role of revendicateur has been temporarily assumed by his elder brother Shaikh Ahmad and Beg Mahmud Agha Zibari, while Mulla Mustafa sits back and disclaims any responsibility for what these two may do. Mulla Mustafa was persuaded to meet the Mutasarrif of Erbil, to whose charge Barzan has now been transferred, at Walash on the 17th January, and the results of the meeting are said to have been satisfactory. An amnesty for Mulla Mustafa and his followers for the events of 1943-44 will shortly be laid before Parliament, and is expected to be passed without much opposition. Apprehension in the Rowanduz-Barzan area is stated to be growing as a result of rumours of approaching Iraqi army manoeuvres in the north in which British troops are to participate and highly-coloured rumours are circu lating of when and where the army will attack and of “ counter-measures ” being taken by the Kurds. Much of this agitation can be discounted, but there is no denying that tension exists and the situation will require careful handling. I propose prior to my departure to address a farewell letter to Mulla Mustafa in which I shall not only explain clearly that the coming military exercises will neither threaten nor impinge on his territory, but will also tender him some good advice as to conduct and his relations with the Arab authorities. This problem is largely a conflict of wrong. In the past, the Bagdad Government has been neglectful and vindictive in dealing with its Kurdish areas. On the other hand, the Kurdish Aghas are ignorant, rapacious and reactionary. Their time is up’, and they know it. They are now fighting a delaying action with all the weapons at their command, of which bluff and blackmail are two. In the end, Bagdad wiL win, but it is our duty to see that, if possible, the victory shall be bloodless. 9. Tribal affairs have been more turbulent than in previous months. In particular, there has been renewed trouble between the Shammar Khurassa tribe of Iraq and the Agaidat from Syria, On the 11 th January a force of A°-aidat numbering, it is said, some 1,000 men, with a similar number of followers, attacked an encampment of the Shammar at Bir al Bugharis north-east of Abu Kemal In the ensuing fight about 120 of the Agaidat were reported killed and eleven of the Shammar also fell. The Agaidat, however, carried off considerable booty which the Iraqi police, who claim to have intervened and stopped the fighting were unable to recover before the raiders had recrossed the border. Police patrols are now out on both sides and the Shammar have been ordered well away from the border. A meeting between the Muhafiz of Heir ez Zor and the Mutasarriff of Mosul has been arranged; but until they agree on a settlement and carry out its terms there will continue to be a danger that similar large-scale raids will recur. 10 . The newly-formed trades unions are showing a certain fairly discreet activity, rsotices appear in the Arabic press from time to time stating that this or that union has sent a petition to some Government department or other asking that the workmen of the trade concerned should be granted a stated favour or concession such as an issue of Government cloth or new sugar ration cards3 fp “ Get-together ” parties have even been arranged between the workers of one part of Bagdad and another. 11 . I have not noticed that the unions have displayed much leaning towards “communism,” but as a subject of conversation this is still much to the fore. The arrival of M. Krikori Titovitch Zaitzev, the new Russian Minister, has inevitably led to much propaganda and many rumours. Not the least of the latter was to the effect that you and I, Sir, had opposed the establishment of diplomatic ^ relations between Iraq and the Soviet and that the Russians had refused to appoint a Minister until I had been removed : the news of my resignation, coming as it did with M. Zaitzev, appeared to some to confirm this ridiculous theory. It is perhaps, at the same time, a small pointer to the power with which the Russians are credited by some of the uninformed in this country : Omne ignotum 'pro magnifico. 12. The Russian Minister himself is a pleasant young man, but not appar ently a very outstanding personality. He has a capable Counsellor (formerly the Russian Consul at Kermanshah) named Klimov who has established friendly contact with my staff and it is thought in Iraqi circles that Klimov is the real brain in the Russian Legation. So far, there is little to report on their activities and such information as I have received shows that only the known “communists’ have gone out of their way to flaunt their dutiful belief in the Soviet system. 13. On the 7 th February A wad al Bahrawi Beg returned to Bagdad as Egyptian Minister. I knew him when he was here before in 1941 and find him an agreeable and friendly colleague. 14. A Syrian by the name of Baha ud Din Bakri, married to a daughter of*Yasin Pasha al Hashimi, arrived here on the 8 th February in the capacity of Syrian Charge d’Affaires. Though he has secured a house for the legation, he has not yet begun to function as official Syrian representative, and Syrian visas are still being granted by His Majesty’s Consulates and Embassy here. 15. M. Bakri has nonetheless had a busy time for the President of Syria, Shukri Beg Quwatli, has just been here on an official visit, accompanied by Sa’adullah Jabiri and others. The President and his party travelled in aircraft put at their disposal by the air officer commanding and were very grateful for this courtesy. As I have reported by telegram, the visit cannot be regarded as an outstanding success. In the first place, as you are aware, the relations between the Syrian Republic and the Hashimites, never easy, since the latter regard Damascus as by rights a Hashimite capital, have been strained ever since the Amir Abdullah was refused permission to visit Syria last August. More recently, the fact that President Quwatli flew to Jedda without informing the Iraqi Government of the object of this visit, caused a good deal of resentment here because it is felt locally that this country did far more for Syrian indepen dence than any other in the Arab world. The Regent was by no means pleased to see President Quwatli, and had even talked of being out of Bagdad when he arrived. The general atmosphere therefore lacked cordiality and the receptions were formal and languid. Shukri Quwatli himself and his colleagues were cast down by the failure of the United Nations to invite Syria to attend the San Francisco Conference. It cannot be said that this visit has done anything to advance the prospects of Arab unity. Indeed, it has served to underline once again the strength of the personal, sectional and dynastic*rivalries which obstruct the path to federation, of which mention has already been made in paragraphs 5 and 6 above. 16. The Minister Resident in Cairo accompanied by Lady Grigg and his private secretary honoured me with a visit from the 5th to 8 th March. During his stay Sir Edward Grigg met the Regent, the Iraqi Prime Minister and Foreign Minister and other leading Iraqi politicians. He also paid a flying visit to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company refinery at Abadan. His visit was most opportune and successful. 17. While he was here the invitations to the San Francisco Conference were issued and Sir Edward and I had to receive the Iraqi Prime Minister, the Foreign | Minister and two ex-Prime Ministers to record their protests that Svria and the Lebanon had not been invited. Comment in the press on this omission has been blunt and even bitter. There has even been criticism that Transjordan was not invited, though I do not think this has been meant very seriously. 18. On the 31st January Ramzi Nafi’ Agha, the Iraqi member of a German parachute expedition which landed in Iraq in 1943, and who was captured by the Iraqi police, was tried by an Iraqi court martial and sentenced to twenty years’ penal servitude under chapter 12 of the Bagdad Penal Code. The two 'para chutists mentioned as being at large in paragraph 20 of my despatch under reference have yet to be detained. [64—51] b 219 On the 3 rd March a new list of twenty-two persons released from intern ment at Amara was published. They are all men of no account, largely persons interned on criminal charges who should normally have been sent to the common jaih . . - . 20. Some of the members of the Iraqi delegation to the recent Conference of Chambers of Commerce at New York have returned. They visited other cities of the United States, and report that they were very courteously received by the Commercial Secretariat of His Majesty’s Embassy at Washington. One of them, Abdul Hadi Chelabi, has spoken a little to a member of my staff of his impressions of America, and did not seem to‘be unduly impressed with the advantages of trading with that country. He reported that in many cases, such as that of irrigation pumps and engines, the American product was more expensive than the British, and no better. In luxury articles such as radios, refrigerators and cars the Iraqis could not do better than turn to the United States, but for other things he felt that the United Kingdom was still the best source of supply. He was surprised to find that the highest class of poplin and woollen cloth to be bought in America comes from Great Britain. He said that the Americans appeared to want to buy Iraqi dates, and he had actually been approached by the Ford Company for a deal involving a thousand tons of dates. The Americans, so he said, somewhat resented the way in which we had monopolised the date trade during the war. It is to be regretted that Abdul Hadi Chelabi’s public comments have been far less constructive. In the vernacular press and elsewhere he has, indeed, given expression to some surprising nonsense on the possibilities of trade expansion between this country and America, and has aroused expectations of dollar credits on an impressive scale. 21 . Dates have, I am afraid, been a sore point for the last two months, so far as growers on the Tigris and Euphrates are concerned. These growers have bitterly complained of the treatment they have received at the hands of the concessionary company, Messrs. Andrew Weir &amp; Co.. Ltd., who have perhaps been rather inclined to stand very strictly to the letter of the concession. The Date Board also appear to have helped in creating misunderstandings. In short, the growers of Zehdi dates outside the Basra area find themselves with large quantities of dates on their hands which Andrew Weirs refuse to take, for technical reasons, and which they are unable to sell elsewhere by reason of the concession and of the lack of transport. I hope, however, that the problem will be satisfactorily solved shortly, for it is one which is of concern to many Shaikhs and notables. 22 . Discussions with the Iraqi Ministry of Finance looking to an agreement for the supply of L nited States dollars and other scarce foreign exchange for the essential needs of this country during the current year are still in progress, and at last show signs of being successfully concluded. After some blunt speaking on the part of this embassy, Saleh Jabr has finally agreed to the surrender of such exchange to the sterling pool and to our other main desiderata. At the time of writing, the mam question still outstanding is that of “invisibles” i e the provision of dollars for the Regent’s visit to the United States, for Iraq’s part m Arab propaganda, for students and so on. If, as now seems likely the present Minister of Finance is dropped from the Cabinet in the near future and replaced 7 the more knowledgeable and conciliatory Abdullilah Hafidh, the last stages of these difficult negotiations should proceed smoothlv and with relative speed 23. There is little change to report in the economic situation in general. 1 he country continues to suffer from an inordinately high price leveP and a striking shortage in consumer goods. Cotton textiles have, however been arriving in reasonable quantities and distribution has now taken place in most areas. United Kingdom Commercial Corporation purchases of barley under last year s contact have been going well, and look like being completed before the end of May. I hanks to abundant ram during the winter, crop prospects are excellent and a barley surplus of 350 to 400,000 tons is confidently predicted This has ^ recommend to you, Sir, the desirability of an early decision on the part of His Majesty s Government on their policy towards this crop surplus this year I have represented that while we control all shipping and other transport serving this country, we cannot divest ourselves of interest in the disposal of surnli^ gram, which m turn foreshadows a continuation of “ political buying ” if serious political complications are to be avoided. While comparisons between local and world prices are unreal owing to the continued existence of special conditions in this and other Middle Eastern markets, prices this season should show a marked [han thoVpaidTln m 3 . year ’ ^ “ tUrn ^ Very conside ™bly lower 24. Throughout the period under review the press has been more free and therefore more interesting than formerly. On the whole, its growing freedom has55 o not so far been greatly abused. It is only occasionally, as for instance over Syria 01 e ic ease o internees, that I have found it necessary to suggest moderation. So far as polrtrcal detainees are concerned, the murder in Egypt of Ahmed Maher by a pro-Fascist fanatrc he hrmself had caused to be released from internment, did not escape notrce here Compared with the vernacular press of Syria, Egypt and Palestine, the Bagdad papers are temperate and although from time‘to time articles do appear which can be construed as criticism of Britain, it must not be overlooked that day after day newspapers print articles which are verv much in our favour An interesting development is that the Bagdad Radio has taken of its own initiative to broadcasting a daily translation of “ the Watchtower,” the leading article m the Iraq Times. 25. The British Council has continued to function satisfactorily, and has made a preliminary selection of six research students who are to ‘be sent to England at the Council s expense for the next academic year. the beginning of this month Shakespeare was performed in English m Bagdad for the first time. Egyptian companies have given Arabic versions of some of Shakespeare s plays, and he has been seen and heard in English at the cinema; but the production of “ Romeo and Juliet ” recently at the King Eaisal &lt;{ ^ vas 'l e English presentation on the stage. It was performed by the assan I layers, a group of military amateurs under the direction of a medical missionary^who is at present a staff surgeon here. Their first production was t ecker s liassan some eighteen months ago. They have also performed a translation of Sophocles “Antigone” and T. S. Eliot’s “Murder in the Cathedral. It was very noticeable that on the first night of the Shakespeare performances the majority of the audience were young Iraqis. T Freedom ” recently arranged an exhibition called Iraq Know Ihyself, the purpose of which was to bring home to the people of laq by means of cartoons and diagrams the principal hygienic deficiencies of the country. It has been remarkably successful and called' forth official commenda tion from the Minister of Education. The exhibition is mwv touring the provinces On its return to Bagdad, it is to be shown at the Iraq Army Officers’ Club, at the request of the Minister of Defence. • T^ n ^ m P or ^ an l' series of changes has taken place or is taking place amono- the British Advisers to the Iraqi Government. Mr. C. J. Edmonds, Adviser to Interior, is leaving shortly after some thirty years in Iraq. Mr. A. I. Ditchburn formerly m Land Settlement here, has arrived to take Mr. Edmonds’ place and will take over shortly. Mr. K. J. Ritchie, Adviser to Education, has left after only a few months’ work on doctors’ orders, and he will shortly be succeeded by Lieut.-Colonel C. H. 0. Scaife, formerly associate professor of English at Fuad al Awwal University in Cairo. Mr. E. T Caparn has become Technical Adviser to the Ministry of Communications and Works, in which he has long been Chief Engineer Mr. Forwood has taken up his post as Inspector-General of the Fubhc Works Department and Mr. Sainsbury has settled down happily to his complex duties in the sphere of income tax. ‘ 29. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s High Commis sioner for Palestine and Transjordan, the Minister Resident in the Middle East at Cairo, tlm Government of India, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf tb^ Political Agent at Kuwait, the Political Intelligence Centre in the Middle East and to His Majesty’s Consular Officers in Iraq.

He then stresses the importance to Britain of maintaining the present good relations both from the point of view of Iraq's strategic position, oil and communications, and because of the increased interest in the Middle East taken by America and Russia, and the present tendency throughout that region tffc' eliminati^. foreign influence.

'HiSsfi Copy No* i 1 Q JL tv O Sir K. Cornwallis to Mr. Eden.—(Received l§th April.) (No. 134.) Sir, Bagdad, %Qth March, 1945. ON the eve of my departure from Bagdad, it may be of interest if I briefly review the situation as it stands to-day at the end of the four years during which I have had the honour to be head of this mission. 2. When I arrived in April 1941 Rashid Ali al Gailani had established a stranglehold on administration throughout the country. His chief supporters were a clique of ambitious politicians and army officers who had been brought up under the old Turkish regime. Rashid Ali was not a popular deader, but by methods which by now have unfortunately become only too familiar, he established an armed dictatorship, and the people, cowed into acquiescence, could offer no resistance. Few Iraqis dared to visit me during that month. 3. The fundamental reasons for this state of affairs were four. First must be put the gradual weakening of the administration and of the authority of the Government over a period of eight years which was punctuated by coups d’Etat. Next was the fact that, with the death of King Faisal in 1933, the country lost its chief unifying force. His son, King Ghazi, was wild and unbalanced, and when he met his death in 1938 the Crown passed to a child of 4. The latter’s uncle, the Amir Abdul Illah, who became Regent, was completely inexperienced, a stranger to the country, and hampered by shyness and hesitancy. Nor had he any sensible or capable supporters to help him in establishing his position. He thus fell an easy prey to an unscrupulous gang. Thirdly, there were the Germans. Their old plans for eastern expansion were being revived; and they sent here as their minister a most industrious, experienced and energetic propagandist in Dr. Grobba. In contrast to the task of his British diplomatic colleagues, who sought to guide the footsteps of a mercurial people on to constructive paths, his role was easy : he had to undermine and destroy. In this he was powerfully assisted by the growing might of Germany and by the dynamism that emanated from Berlin and Rome. Britain, on the other hand, seemed to be sunk in apathy. Fourthly, to crown all, came the Arab rebellion in Palestine, and the harsh, but ineffective, measures which we were taking to suppress it. Day after day the German and Italian radio would denounce our actions, and day after day we made no attempt to justify them. Our foreign policy in general was weak and vacillating and our prestige sank steadily. 4. At the same time the contrast between Iraq and other parts of the Arab world was striking. In Saudi Arabia a strong man was in control of a kingdom which he himself had made, a kingdom which had never been the object of German ambitions. In Egypt and in Palestine we had maintained appreciable military forces for strategic reasons. In Syria the people were under control of the French army. In Iraq, however, despite its paramount importance, there were a few British aircraft but no British troops and no effective organisation to fight enemv activities. Over a period of seven or eight years we had sat back and watched our influence decline. It was small wonder that, comparing our apparent weak ness and ineffectiveness with the dominating position we had held only ten years before, the people of Iraq considered that, much as some might regret it, our time was done. 5. It was obvious in April 1941 that Rashid Ali hoped, by feigning loyajty to the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty, to keep His Majesty’s Government in play until such time as the Germans were able to send forces to Iraq. The prompt decision of His Majesty’s Government to send troops to Basra saved the situation and placed Rashid Ali in a quandary. If he allowed British troops to come to Bagdad he * would perish; if he opposed them before the Germans were ready, he could^iot rely on the help of his secret ally. The arrival at Basra from India of a second brigade forced his hand and he decided to attack while our forces were still weak. &amp; The tribes which had waited and watched during April continued inactive during May, deaf to all his exhortations. [65—56] f ^ W2 6 . When Bagdad was freed at the end of Ma); 1941 by a small column that could scarcely have reached here had the desert tribes thrown in then o wi Rashid Ali, it became clear that the country in the main was with us, and was much relieved to see the last of that traitor and his gang. But many pro-Uerman pockets still existed, especially in the towns, and there was still the dangei o German invasion—invasion from two sides, for at the end of 1941 the enemy stood both upon the frontiers of Egypt and in the foothills of the Caucasus. In these|| circumstances my aim was— {a) To secure full facilities for our war requirements and unimpeded oppor tunities for training and defensive measures by our navy, army and Royal Air Force. (b) To root out pro-Nazis and bring about a change in public feeling, both to facilitate {a) and, looking further ahead, to consolidate our future position by making people realise the advantage of alliance with us. (c) Unofficially and in the hope of helping to create greater stability, to influence the administration as far as possible, but not to the extent of causing a crisis and so jeopardising {a) and {b). Owing to my per sonal knowledge of the working of the governmental machine and my old friendship with Ministers, shaikhs and others, I happened to be favourably placed for this. 7. To attain {a) and (b) it was necessary to get in touch with all classes of society, who had been neglected for years, and to proceed by a co-ordinated plan. Accordingly, I formed a political advisory staff, whose duty was to act as liaison officers between our army and Iraqi officials, especially in the provinces, to fight enemy propaganda, to make friends with leaders and, generally, to restore British influence. I was extremely fortunate in securing the services of several officers who had long experience of Iraq and were liked and respected by its inhabitants. They, with their young assistants, have produced remarkable results. They quickly helped to stabilise the country, and they are now frequently invited to assist in administrative problems. They have worked closely with the Public Relations staff, which, in addition to ordinary propaganda work of press and radio, has done much to increase knowledge of Britain and the British by the establishment of reading rooms, the operation of travelling cinemas, and above all by establishing personal contact with people in all walks of life. The Ikhwan al Hurriyah, or Brotherhood of Freedom, is a third organisation which has helped to establish touch with the people, not only in Bagdad but in provincial towns also. Fourthly, in Bagdad, Mosul, Basra and Kirkuk the British Council has made a valuable contribution in bringing about a better understanding of our country and its aims. Finally, tribute must be paid to the work of the British military mission, of British advisers and many other of the Iraqi Government officials, and of the area liaison officers under the orders of Combined Intelligence Centre, Iraq. Nor must mention be omitted of the British army, which, by its traditional straight dealing and good behaviour, has done a great deal to heal old wounds. It is, indeed, a source of gratification to me, and a real tribute to the personnel con cerned, that all these different bodies have worked closely and amicably to°-ether and with general headquarters and this embassy. 8 . In short, it has been my endeavour to establish, through every possible means, closer relations between Iraqis of all classes and individual Britons and I now have the satisfaction of recording that to-day Britons and Iraqis mix far more than they ever did before. My task has been made easier by the fact that Iraqis as a whole were not with Rashid Ali, and that his revolt came as a profound shock to them. They were ashamed, and wanted to make amends. Consequently we received full co-operation, both from the Government and from the people as a whole, even in the most difficult days of 1941 and 1942. As a proof of this, it is to be noted that suspects of all kinds were energetically rounded up and interned, that the Iraqi authorities themselves, of their own motion, tried and hanged three of the four members of the Golden Square who fell into their hands, and that all Rashid Ali’s Ministers who are not in exile are in prison. Not a murmur has been heard from anyone against the execution of thes.e drastic sentences. 9. As regards the question of influencing the Administration, it is not perhaps always realised how difficult Iraq is to govern. Unlike Egypt and the Levant, before the British occupation Iraq had been subject to almost no Western influences. The country consisted in fact of three of the most neglected provinces of a moribund empire. In addition, it was and is divided by secular feuds and differences—the Shia still nurtures his 1.000-year-old resentment4MB* against the Sunni, the Kurd is antagonistic to the Arab, the Christian and Jewish communities (two of the most ancient of their kind in existence any where) are apprehensive of the Moslem majority. Townsmen have little in common with tribesmen, who are heavily armed and -accustomed from time immemorial to resist by force any encroachment on their privileges. This complex society calls for the highest standard of administration. Moreover, | Iraq has many hundred miles of wild land frontiers, with potentially trouble- ' some neighbours, Turkey, Persia and Saudi Arabia. Even in peace-time it is a difficult country to govern, but with the dislocation, mostly economic, which the war has inevitably brought with it, it is small wonder that the people have felt discontented with their Government. To deal with this situation the Iraqi Government had at their disposal a corps of officials, few of whom had received a Western education, and most of whom had been corrupted by ten years of misrule. Working with them was a very small group of British officials, Fortunately, the Iraqi Government realised their own shortcomings and applied increasingly to us for help, with the result that there are now more British officials in the Government than for many years past. Indeed, we cannot supply all the officers that are wanted. Of their own volition the Iraqi Government have, since 1941, placed Britons in executive charge of Imports and Exports, Irrigation, the Veterinary Service and the Transport Service, and we have also Britons as heads of the Port and of the Railways administrations. In all the Ministries where they are employed British advisers are now effectively consulted. This has applied particularly to education, which before was a focus of anti- British agitation. On the whole, therefore, in spite of much corruption and inefficiency, it is only fair to record that the Iraqis have risen well to the occasion. Everywhere public security is good and taxes are collected. There is naturally grumbling about the high cost of living, the shortage of textiles and other commodities, but it is not serious. Only in Kurdistan to-day is there a potentially dangerous tension. 10. While the position is therefore comparatively satisfactory, it would be most misleading to pretend that it will automatically remain so. The problem of government without experienced assistance is too difficult for these people in their present state of development. This is clear now. It will become even clearer when Britisih troops, which have done so much to steady the situation during the last four years, are withdrawn after the war. Besides the inherent stresses which I have described in paragraph 9, there are too many personal hates and rivalries, too little mutual confidence and public spirit, and too much intrigue to ensure stability and continuity, without some external influence. The Regent, although he showed considerable personal courage in 1941, and although his affection for Britain is beyond question, is none the less no leader. He has many of the qualities and defects of his father. With his private friends (most of whom are British) he has an easy, natural manner, and he likes and is liked by the Iraqi army, whose exercises he constantly attends, and which | Pe is determined shall not again, if he can help it, be used against him. But he finds his public duties a very heavy burden, largely because there is no Iraqi in whom he feels he can place implicit confidence. He therefore needs piopping up all the time. There is no present alternative to him, and in any case anothei chano-e in the head of the State would be most unfortunate. It must always be borne in mind that the Regent is far from being a mere figure-head. In fact though not in theory/almost every appointment, every measure of administration, is subject to his personal wish. The chief politicians with whom for some few years more, must rest the leadei ship of the Cabinet are individualists. When they get into office their chief preoccupation is to score off their opponents, and to undermine hostile combinations in the Senate. Xo Cabinet can endure long enough to produce continuity or stability. It is we who should provide the latter, and I fear that we must do it for some tune to come; because the rising generation, while it has produced many ardent critics, has hitherto furnished no men of courage or action. So far as the educatec class is concerned, it is a generation of Hamlets. The malcontents of the so-called intelligentsia have pretended in this country, as m others, to be attiacted to Russian political ideas. There are probably less than a score of people in Iraq who have even the most superficial knowledge of the Russian pout k a system, but “ communism has become a cloak for any critical opinion, whethei honestly or dishonestly held. Some old Nazi wolves, wearing Communist clothing have already established themselves in the progressive fold. This problem will increase and will, indeed, become one of the most difficult which we have to face. We have in the past, here as elsewhere, been accused of backing [65—56] B 2“ the old gang.” To some extent we have done so, but, as I have explained above, it has been a question of force majeure, for no new gang has so tar emerged; and until it does, if the Government is to be maintained at all, it must be through those who have held sway hitherto. The real trouble lies not NV1 us, but with the rulers themselves, who obstinately refuse to give up am o their privileges or prerogatives to others. There are now signs that the) me becoming apprehensive for their future, and I and my staff continually do ic f**- best we can to stimulate their apprehension; for unless they do make some con cessions, a violent clash between the haves and the have-nots is inevitable in time. * , f 11 . If Iraq were not important to us, it might pay us to get out, but it is, in fact, extremely important. In addition to its strategic position, its 01 and its communications, we have a third reason. We cannot afford to neglect Iraq in view of the interest which Russia and the United btates are now taking in the Middle East. We no longer hold the field alone. But how are we to maintain our position? What means can we use; The whole tendency of all Middle East countries is, as you are aware, to eliminate foreign influence as soon as possible. Already in Egypt there is clamour for a modification of the treatv* In Iraq extremists are beginning to raise the same cry, though without so far signifying any single particular in which they consider revision desiiaole. In such an atmosphere it is obvious that any idea of tightening control by force, or of keeping permanently larger forces than those defined in the Anglo-Iiaqi Treatv is completely out of date. Nevertheless, it is possible for us to maintain our place here, and indeed, to enhance it; because there is no doubt whatever that Iraq is fundamentally far more friendly to us than to any other Rower now or at any other time, and it is worth while to keep it so. In his speech of farewell to me last week the Minister for Foreign Affairs publicly declared that the policy of the Iraqi Government was to continue to employ “ British scientists and experts in various branches and to train Iraqis in Great Britain to be scientists and experts.” In the same speech his Excellency stated that Iraq s friendship with Britain is the cornerstone of her policy. This statement, which would have been branded as “treachery ’ four years ago, has been widely acclaimed, both in public and in private. This feeling rests on a sound basis; for more and more people in Iraq are coming to see that the treaty, which at the time when it was signed w^as by many regarded as a bond of servitude, is, in fact, a guarantee of freedom. They realise that by granting us concessions as regards oil and communications (from both of wRich Iraq matei ially benefits) they have engaged us to maintain their frontiers; and they acknowledge that in a war in which so many frontiers have been obliterated we have held these inviolate without ever, even after 1941, encroaching on Iraq’s internal independence. „ . . 12. The desiderata I consider for the maintenance of our present relations are ;— (a) Sympathetic and understanding treatment of Iraq’s problems by His Maiesty’s Government, especially of economic problems and those connected with the change over from war to peace in the next few years. Such treatment will make these people feel that, apart from other considerations, their close associations with us redound to their material benefit. I have been told that some departments in London are antagonistic to Iraq because they think Iraqis are grasping. They are, and so are all Orientals—and perhaps some Westerners too ° As Bismarck said of the Balkans : “ Liberated nations are not grateful— thev are exacting.” But it is of British interests that we should think, and we should realise that by downing Iraq we injure ourselves. We should not be weak but we should be fair and just, and we should avoid like the plague adopting a “tough line” just to be tough. Above all, we should avoid any action which might injure the amour-profre of the country and its citizens. They are a small people, at the beginning of their independent existence, and it is natural that they should have an adolescent sensitiveness. Almost over night public opinion can change. An inconsiderate act or speech produces an exaggerated despondency, and a kind word an equally disproportionate buoyancy. °(&amp;) The officials we send here should be of sound character and knowledge. An ambassador’s influence must always be limited by the nature of his office. Our real influence should be inside the Government, through British officials. If we provide good men, there is no reason why Iraq should not ask for more, but there is nothing to gain in forcing officials on the Iraqi Government, and we must always remember that Iraqis are very critical of foreigners, whom they5 pay so very much higher than their own Ministers, and are quick to spot a second- rater. I have long held that the provision of the mo»t suitable men will be best assured by the creation of a Middle East personnel pool, embracing the Foreign | Office, Colonial Office and India Office, from which trained and competent men could be seconded. I trust that some such plan may soon materialise. (c) It is most important that we should maintain the personal contacts which we have created. We should therefore keep on the organisations of Political Advisorate and Public Relations for as long as possible. When the time comes to give them up, we must hope that there will be some administrative inspectors or land settlement officers in the districts. Failing this, we should consider the establishment of more consulates whose duties would be mainly politico-social. The British Institutes must be encouraged and the more British officials we can get into the Education Department, both in the towns and in the districts, the better. The Oriental Secretariat of this embassy will become more important as the other organisations change or disappear, and it must place high value on personal contacts. 13. A relationship between Iraq and Britain has developed which places us in a strong and enviable position. It will, I consider, be our own fault if we allow that position to deteriorate. We must be continually on our guard and on the alert, for naturally we have many enemies and critics, not all of them Iraqi. Finally, we must take into account in all our actions the new feeling of / solidarity and unity which animates the whole Arab world. The Arabs them- / selves have publicly acknowledged that it is we who have sponsored it and that it is we who have made its realisation possible. It is all the more important, therefore, to consider the Arab world as one, and not as various units on the map, to be handled individually or in sections by different Government depart ments. Our policy towards the Middle Fast as a whole, it seems to me, requires | greater co-ordinatiom It may, for example, seem a small thing in London to ( present the King of Egypt with an aircraft and to make the Regent of Iraq pay for his. But such an incident can have serious consequences as implying favouritism. And, as Lord Killearn has stated, we must be on our guard against the painful gibe that the only way to get anything out of the British is to kick them. 14. Any action which we take in regard to Syria or Palestine, for instance, will, as I have often emphasised, have a direct and immediate bearing on our position, influence and prospects in Iraq; and it is to the maintenance of British interests and British influence that our efforts should be primarily and consistently devoted. It is creditable to any man that he should feel moved to pity and sym pathy by the sufferings of the Jews, or the Assyrians, or the Kurds or the Arabs; but you cannot govern by sentiment. Political lines of force do not change, and the laws of geography and history cannot be revoked. Our interests in this part of the world have been identical for' more than 200 years. Originally those interests were selfish. They are no longer so, for, whether we will it or not, the lives and fortunes of all the inhabitants of the Middle East are as directly bound up with the maintenance of our position as were those of their ancestors with the existence of the Roman Empire. Were we to be driven from our paramount ( position here, the Middl^ East would dissolve in a chaos such as that which enveloped it when the Roman Empire decayed. In time, it may well be, other nations will be willing to share our responsibilities, as they are already eager to share our privileges. But that day has yet to come. Until it dawns, it is for us to maintain our own, and by so doing to preserve and enhance the tranquillitv and prosperity of this ancient and historic land. 15. I cannot close this last despatch without recording how much I owe to my own staff. I have endeavoured to show that such success as has been achieved during the last four years has been due to the united efforts of a good many depart ments and people working in harmony to a definite end. In this concerted plan, the embassy staff had ti vital and essential part to play, and I cannot speak too highly of the manner in which, one and all, they have acquitted themselves. I owe them a deep debt of gratitude. 16. I am sending a copv of this despatch to the Minister Resident Middle East. I have, &amp;c.

I HAVE the honour to submit, with reference to mv despatch No. 510 of OfZ'lX, the 31st October last, the following report on the main events that have since l occurred in this country. . ^ 2. Throughout the period under review the Cabinet of Hamdi al racnacji has remained in office in spite of repeated rumours that it was about to fal . x. The belief that it could not last much longer was shared by several of its members and the criticism to which it has been subjected in the Chamber of Deputies and in the local press certainly lent colour to the rumours. Nevertheless, it nov\ seems ^ ^ 17 , more stable than it did two months ago. It is generally understood that the present Cabinet will repiain in being at least until Nuri Pasha and Arshad al Umari return from Egypt. On the 20th December ministerial changes were announced, consequent upon the election of Mohammed Hassan Kubba as Presi dent of the Chamber. His place at the Ministry of Social Affairs was taken ay Abdul Majid Allawi, a Shia civil servant who was for long a member of the^O^ Iraqi Foreign Service, and has recently been head of the Political Department v*' \).0 of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, shortly before his departure to Egypt, gave up his position as Acting Minister of Defence to General Ismail Namiq, who since October 1941 had been Acting Caief of the General Staff. The latter appointment, which was suggested by the Regent and warmly approved by General Renton, had the fortunate effect of not making it necessary for the Minister of Finance to act as Minister of Defence in Arshad al Umari’s absence, while at the same time providing General Namiq with a a dignified exit from his previous post. 3. Parliament was opened by the Regent on the 2nd December. The Speech from the Throne followed in the main the lines of former speeches and after referring to the great efforts of the Iraqi Government to further Arab Unity and to the continued good relations with His Majesty’s Government and with other Powers, went on to catalogue the achievements of the Government and list its aims for the future. The programme was not notably impressive, and was widely criticised in the vernacular newspapers. In particular the absence of anv mention of the formation of political parties, or of the freedom of the press, two subjects which have been well to the fore in public comment recently, has caused widespread dissatisfaction. In fact, as I have already reported, the press is now being allowed far greater latitude than formerly; though it is still subject to stricter control than the newspapers of neighbouring countries. 4. In opening the debate on the reply to the Address from the Throne on the 31st December, Hamdi al Pachachi considered it necessary to make a long speech to the Chamber defending his administration, and amplifying its foreign policy. He said that Iraq had'played a leading part in the Alexandria Con ference, had done everything possible to hasten its meeting, and had besides insisted that something^concrete must result from it. He claimed that Iraq was largely responsible for the Alexandria Protocol and the idea of the Arab League In the second place, he said that Iraq had exerted every effort to persuade the Governments of the United States, Turkey, Persia and Afghanistan to recognise the independence of Syria and the Lebanon, and he gave the impression that their eventual recognition of that independence was partially, at least, the result of Iraqi efforts. The third plan in Iraq’s foreign policy, said the Prime Minister, was support for the Arabs of Palestine. Concrete proposals had been put forward for this purpose. The opening of Propaganda Bureaux in London and Washington had been urged and the Iraqi Council of Ministers had just approved the spending of a sum of 10,000 dinars as Iraq’s contribution to these bureaux during the current financial year, to be followed by another ID. 20,000 during the coming one. Propaganda, he declared, was most necessary for the Arab cause, '[62— 11] b * 1J:2S. P3L mi itand he alleged that Zionism was a graver menace than Hitler. The Iraqi Glovernment had also strongly urged all the Arab Governments to support the ‘ k National Fund ” started in Palestine to buy up land there which would other wise be sold to the Jews. There seems to be some prospect that Iraq will subscribe to this activity also. 5. As regards domestic affairs, Hamdi al Pachachi explained that the slow^ ness of the progress in public works, particularly irrigation projects, was largely due to the lack of experts, and indeed I fear this is only too true. Not only for technical spheres, but for such things as medicine and supplies, great difficulty has been encountered in responding to Iraqi requests for British officials. It is most desirable that really capable Britons should be found in the future to make j good the present shortage, and to fill future vacancies. 6 . Communism ” has been a topic of conversation ever since the announce ment that diplomatic relations had been established with the Soviet Union and that a Russian Minister was to be expected here shortly; but the advent of the Russian Consul from Kermanshah just before Christmas to acquire actual and imposing premises for a legation has greatly increased the flood of speculation and gossip. The wealthy classes are, of course, particularly apprehensive, and even go so far as erroneously to ascribe the Kurdish troubles to Russian inspira tion. On the occasion of “ 'Id al Fitr ” religious holiday, professedly Communist leaflets were distributed in the streets of Bagdad calling for internal reform, food and clothing for the people and the revival of political life. This manifesto was naturally ascribed to Kamil Chadirchi and his Fabian friends, who are generally labelled as “ Communists.” Whoever may have been responsible, there is no doubt that many educated young Iraqis are impatient with the selfish maladministration of the ” old gang,” though the former seem to be almost equally lacking in constructive ideas or the courage to realise them. The discus- s ^ n j n ^ n gl an d of plans for social reorganisation have undoubtedly inspired a teelmg that the time has come for some measure of social advance in Iraq. It might be expected tiiat the ruling class, if onlv out of fear, would itself under take measures of reform, and I and my staff lose no opportunity of impressing this on those who anxiously whisper the word “ communism.” That reform must come is clear, but that it should have to be the Communists, who profess to be inspired by Russia and by Marxist doctrines, who should lead the public demand, is a pity. But I doubt whether the Pashas can ever be persuaded to abandon their present attitude, and 1 understand that Mustafa al Umari, the present Minister of Interior, is contemplating the formation of a party to oppose com munism and defend vested interests. Political parties, whether Communist or otherwise, aie the subject of much talk at the moment, and we shall I think see their re-emergence in the not distant future. . r , As 1 have already reported in detail, Kurdish affairs have occupied much of the Government s time, and also much of mine. There was a violent flutter m the middle of December, when Mulla Mustafa set out on a flag-march towards Amadia and Zakho with what wa,s first said to be 250 armed men, though this igure was later reduced to 85. When asked what he was doing he said to have replied curtly: Training,” and this did not help to make Ministers feel more comiortable. Their immediate reaction in fact has been to support more actively the reorganisation of the army by General Renton in readiness for a possible campaign against Mulla Mustafa in the spring. Indeed, people like Saleh Jabr and Mustafa al 1)man are spoiling for a fight.” The Mulla’s behaviour has certainly been overbearing and tyrannical; and it is a pity that the Government by the slow development of their policy and administrative inertia, have allowed a brigand to assume something of the importance of a national figure. His imme diate neighbours and many of his humble countrymen who suffer from his exactions and depredations, regard him in no such light 8 . Meanwhile, the Government have taken action, however grudging and inadequate. From the 20 th November to the 26th November the Minister of ™s's a HS d a ( i he p n 0 b he b n IT 8 ? Came back certain Concrete pioposals. Hamdi al Pachachi displayed a most commendable spirit of conciliation, and eventually forced through the Council of Ministers an order “sulLlwal Sf B f T z 7 .f nd ,Mazuri Bala from the Qadha of lib^ (m Ku r d ish 1 Mu tesla ri f^^a \ ^ bl ’ there ? S an ener g etic a ncl sympathetic . dish Mutessanf, Said Qazzaz. I have considerable hope that this action may go far to restore the situation in Barzan to normal. Efforts are alreadv n em p made to transport the 800 tons of free barley destined for the area whic^ has been lying at Aqra for four months; and the mutessarif is himself preplan. to visit Barzan, a thing which the Mutessarif of Mosul would not dream^f doim?3^ 3 r 'itpr ^ r 9. In the debate on the reply to the Address, the state of Kurdistan came under discussion, and Majid Mustafa and another Kurdish Deputy from Erbil made a favourable impression by their exposition of the simple nature of Kurdish grievances and the absence of any separatist ambitions. 10 . The rest of Kurdistan has been quiet, the inflated price being paid for -'tobacco by the Government contributing much to this. ^ 11 . The tribal situation remains tranquil. There have been the usual small skirmishes over land or more trivial causes, but these are politically unimportant. I am glad to say that the Political Advisory staff have as usual played a discreet, but effective, part in settling these disputes. 12 . The rains have been exceptionally plentiful in the last two months and crop prospects are good. Reports indicate that the proportion of barley sown this year as against wheat may be higher owing to the lack of enough wheat seed. In the absence of unforeseen disease or other natural developments, growers will certainly be faced with a very large surplus, for which it will be harder than ever to find a foreign market even at a price more in conformity with world prices than they have grown accustomed to expect. Meanwhile United Kingdom Commercial Corporation purchases under last year’s agreement are so far proceeding smoothly and rapidly. 13. The supply situation remains difficult, though there has been a slight improvement, particularly in the distribution of rationed commodities. The distribution of “kham.’' a course cotton cloth, has been notably more equitable than before. The efforts of Mr. C. R. Grice, the director-general of local products and acting director-general of imports, together with the activities of Mr. R. Corderoy who has toured most of the country, personally supervising the distribution of cloth, should be mentioned in this connexion. A few days before the close of the year the Iraqi Government were officially informed by Identic British and American notes, that on the 1 st January, 1945. Middle East Supply Centre control over a large category of imports would be relaxed. While this announcement at first caused much satisfaction, the range of commodities still to be “ screened” in Cairo and, for various reasons, still in short supply, has been found to be so extensive that it has come to be regarded as not meaning very much. 14. In December Mr. Davidson, representing the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury, and Mr. Gilbert, of the Board of Trade, visited Bagdad briefly in the hope of agreeing with the Iraqi authorities on the allocation to this country during 1945 of United States dollars and other “scarce” foreign exchange. From the beginning the Minister of Finance proved difficult, and it seems clear that he resented Mr. Davidson’s inability to spare more than five days for this capital after several weeks of successful negotiations in Cairo, thinking that an attempt was being made to stampede him into complex commitments without his being afforded sufficient time to consider fully their implications. Other difficulties, such as an incipient Cabinet crisis, also supervened, while there is reason to suppose that the influence of the American Minister, exerted through Ibrahim Kebir, the Iraqi accountant-general, against any arrangements involving strict control of dollar exchange, was an additional complication. 15. Briefly, and in round figures, Mr. Davidson’s proposals envisaged a “target of $13 million for Iraq’s essential purchases in 1945, of which $3 million would be contributed from the sterling dollar pool, the remainder being- obtained from present Iraqi holdings of dollars and potential receipts from exports to the United States. In return, Iraq would undertake to contribute all “ scarce ” currency receipts into the sterling pool, while at the same time re imposing import control upon her trade with Turkey and Persia, such control being considered essential to guard against the latter country especially developing into a wide backdoor entrance for dollar goods into this Kingdom. 16. The request for renewed control over imports from Persia proved the principal rock on which the discussions foundered, though there was also trouble over the Iraqi desire to exempt from compulsory contribution to the sterling pool dollar exchange derived from “abnormal non-commercial transactions,” that is gifts and/or special dollar credits of one sort or another. The Minister of Finance, Saleh Jabr, proved himself extremely obstructive throughout the conversations, while it has since been discovered that the American Minister was strongly opposed to the Iraqi Government limiting their freedom of action in the disposal of their dollar exchange Mr. Henderson has indeed made it perfectly plain, in a frank conversation with a member of my staff, that rigorous control over foreign exchange here could only, in his opinion, militate against any desire [62— 11 ] b 2on the part of the Iraqis to increase exports to the United States, and would besides react upon their schemes for capital development and the extension of cultural relations with America. He feels, I think probably with justice, that the solution lies in agreement between Washington and London. 1/. At the time of writing, the position that has arisen with regard to Iraq 4 is under examination by the interested authorities of His Majesty’s Government, and I am hopeful that in time some means of overcoming the present deadlock may be found. Were it to continue indefinitely, the repercussions on Anglo-Iraqi relations could only be unfortunate. Meanwhile, pending’further instructions 10 m y^ni department, I and the senior members of my staff immediatelv concerned are doing what we can to bring about a better understanding of the problem as a whole by responsible Iraqis, and to this end our offer has been explained to Ibrahim Kemal, who headed the Iraqi delegation to Bretton Woods. Mis reaction was very satisfactory and I understand that within twenty-four !? m \°!i th 1 e of the rec ent abortive negotiations, he had already consulted the British Adviser to the Ministry of Finance, and the minister him- i • n ^ rom v hat I hear, the latter is continuing his studies of the problem which are likely to be influenced by the exact provisions of the Anglo-Egyptian A 0 !cement, the final text of which has only to-day reached Bagdad Wi j, At th f ^ginning of November/Mr. John Smith, Director-General of n A// u T ture p nd Forests 111 ^e Sudan Government, arrived here at the invitation FonnnifTi 0 V T ment m the V er f 0n of TsiW ^ Wahbi, the Kurdish Minister of Economics) to make a report on the forests of Kurdistan.

Considering what a hold Berlin’s Arabic broadcasts used to have here, and the wide reclame acquired by the notorious Yunis Bahri, this spontaneous interest in the B.B.C. seems to me to be an eloquent proof of the value of the London Arabic programme and the authority it now commands. 25. The Amir Talal, eldest son of the Amir of Transjordan, visited Bagdad in October and November and the usual dinners and receptions were given in his honour. He appeared to have a great liking for military life and duties, and spent much time with the detachment of the Arab Legion which is stationed in Bagdad. I have learnt from other sources that the detachment’s commanding officer is much pleased at the friendliness with which he has been treated by British officers here. 26. At last a dean has been found for the Law College, Dr. Abdul Hakim al Rifai from Egypt. I hope this will put an end to the regrettable state of indiscipline in which the college has for so long been sunk. 27. Daud al Haidari, the Iraqi Minister in London, returned, together with his two step-daughters, to Bagdad on the 6 th November. He intends to have a long rest; but it is not yet known whether he will resume his post in London or not. His Excellency and the two girls are loud in their admiration of the British people’s war effort. 28. The reaction of Iraq to the news of Lord Moyne’s assassination was one of horror at this dastardly act, coupled with a certain amount of satisfaction that the Zionists had made such a gigantic blunder. Mr. Churchill’s comments on this crime caused considerable pleasure here. 29. An interesting British memorial has recently been restored in Basra. It is, in fact, the earliest extant commemoration of the British connexion with this country. In 1836 Chesney’s famous expedition started down the Euphrates, but a hurricane overtook them above Anah and one of the two ships, the Tigris, capsized. Twenty of the crew were drowned. The members of the council at Bombay erected a handsome memorial tablet with an inscription in English and Arabic describing the disaster and recording the names of all those who took part in the expedition. For many years past the tablet has lain neglected and forgotten in a disused cemetery. Recently, with the assistance of the Royal Engineers and the Iraqi Government Departijient of Antiquities, it has been re-erected at the foot of the staircase of the British Consulate-General in Basra, and the drinking fountain which it was originally designed to include has at last been added. 30. There have been two sets of Iraqi army manoeuvres in the period, the first in the north, when the Regent was present in camp for several days, and the other in the Muntafiq area and the Western Desert. General Renton appears to be satisfied with the efforts of the more junior officers and the men, but has been drastic in recommending the dismissal of inefficient commanders. The new Chief of the General Staff, General Salih Saib, should prove an energetic director of the army’s work. 31.

(No. 225.) _ ^ ^j r Bagdad, 8th June, 1944. WITH reference to my d espatch N o. 1 24 of the 23rd March*-1 ha\e the honour to submit the following summary of the principal events that have occurred in Irao during the last two or more months :— . 2. The Cabinet formed by Nuri Pasha on Christmas Day remained m an uneasy situation throughout March and most of April. The Regent continued to withhold his active support and to look around for a means to get rid of the three Ministers whom he particularly disliked, namely, Umar Nadhmi, Ali Mumtaz and Sadiq Bassam. I repeatedly warned His Royal Highness that the prolonged uncertainty about the position of the Cabinet was harmful and advised him that his proper policy was either to give it his full confidence or to replace it by another if he were certain that something more satisfactory cQuld he found. At the end of April, after returning from his.tour in the north, His Royal Highness told me that he had decided to keep the present Cabinet in office.. At this stage it seemed that it might prove to be possible for Nuri Pasha’s Cabinet to carry on at least until the end of the summer, but events soon dissipated this prospect. The debate in the Chamber on the budget for. 1944-45 was exploited as usual for the discussion of every branch of the work of the Administration and attacks were made on the Cabinet at all angles. A climax was reached on the 21 st May when abusive language was freely exchanged between Deputies, and the sitting had to be suspended in an atmosphere of some disorder. The Prime Minister and his colleagues were satisfied that their critics would not have dared to become so violent if thev had not felt that they enjoyed at least the sympathy of the Palace. The Ministers decided that they could no longer remain in office in such circum stances and resigned. The Regent accepted their resignation a few days later, and called upon Hamdi Pachachi to form a Cabinet. The invitation was accepted, but as the new Prime Minister, who is elderly and in indifferent health, was indisposed at the time, it fell to the Regent to choose most of his colleagues for 3 . This task was completed within a fortnight and the following Cabinet took office on the 4th June :■— Prime Minister : Hamdi al Pachachi. Minister of Interior : Mustafa al Umari. Minister for Foreign Affairs and Acting Minister of Supply: Arshad al Umari. Minister of Finance : Salih Jabr. Minister of Defence : Tahsin Ali. Minister of Communications and Works : Abdul Amir al Uzri. Minister of Justice : Ahmad Mukhtar Baban. Minister of Education : Ibrahim Akif al Alusi. Minister of Economics : Towfiq Wahbi. Minister of Social Affairs : Muhammad HassamKubba. Like most Iraqi Cabinets it has both good points and bad. Abdul Amir al Uzri, Taufiq Wahbi and Ibrahim Akif al Alusi are newcomers’who offer promise of good work. Arshad al Umari, for years a capable and progressive Lord Mayor of Bagdad, is a well-known thruster and should, if he is not too temperamental, be able to give the new Ministry of Supplies a fair start, and Salih Jabr, if he can resist temptation to sectarian favouritism, has it in him to be an adequate Minister of Finance. The black spot is Mustafa al Umari at Interior. He last held this post in Jamil Madfai’s Cabinet in the summer of 1941, and left it with reputation for corruption, bad even by Iraqi standards. It is a great pity that he should have been permitted to return, and I gather that it was only the essential need for support in the Senate that warn him a place in the Cabinet at all. era V- ? A C3.o. [54—61] REDO. NL. 1 &gt; Jt J|_ ’ INDIA OFFICE4. The “ Edmonds Committee ” on political detainees was reassembled at the end of March by the late Minister of the Interior. They recommended the unconditional release of twenty-five men and the release on security of four others. These recommendations were accepted by the Council of Ministers and the twenty-nine men concerned were freed on the 12 th April. The Military Security authorities were kept fully informed of the committee’s work and no attempt was made by the Minister of the Interior, or any other Minister, to influence the committee’s decisions. 5. The Iraqis interned in Southern Rhodesia returned to Iraq on the 2nd April and were at once taken into custody by the Iraqi authorities. This trial began in May last but does not seem to have made much progress. The change of Government may possibly cause new delays. 6 . In the financial field the major developments during the past two months have been the submission of a record budget to Parliament, the participation of the Iraqi Government in the Middle East Financial Conference in Cairo beginning on the 23rd April, the approval of legislation for the flotation of two internal loans, and the payment of the debt of approximately £330,000 for the Hinaidi Cantonment, which had been outstanding for nearly six years. 7. The 1944-45 budget estimates contain several 'important innovations, including the amalgamation of the ordinary and capital works budgets, hitherto kept separate, and the creation of an emergency budget, covering the expenses of the supplies organisation and the cost-of-living allowances, on the one hand, and profits on Government trading on the other. The total combined revenue is estimated at ID. 17,712,740, which almost balances the total combined expen diture at ID. 17,696,500. The latter figure is ID. 1,555,843 higher than the corresponding figure for the preceding year and is more than twice the pre-war budget expenditure. The budget estimates have been approved by the Chamber of Deputies with comparatively little modification, but only after lively debate, during which full opportunity was taken by Nuri Pasha’s opponents to attack the Government’s policy, especially on supply matters. The estimates are now before the Senate Financial Committee. 8 - The Iraqi Government sent a strong delegation, headed by the Minister r Saiyid Ali Mumtaz, to the Middle East Financial Conference, and 1 understand that they acquitted themselves well. They were able to point out that Iraq was well in the van of the Middle Eastern countries as regards anti- inflation measures, having, for example, already raised income tax to a high level, initiated action for the issue of local loans, as well as being one of the verv few countries in the Middle East where prices of bulk cereals have been showing a downward trend. 9. Legislation was submitted to Parliament on the 18th April authorisiim the flotation of two local loans—one short-term for a total of ID. 1 million bearing interest at 3 per cent., and the other a long-term lottery loan with interest at 4 per cent., of which 2 per cent, will be paid as interest and the remaining 2 per cent, in the form of prizes. The proceeds of the loans are; to be reserved for railway and irrigation development. The Bill was finally approved by Parlia ment on the 28th Ala^y. Doubts continue to be held, however, in some quarters i egarding the outcome of this \enture into what is a novel form of investment in Iraq and at the beginning of May there were for a time heavy withdrawals of currency from the banks owing to malicious rumours to the'effect that bank depositors would be forced to subscribe to the loans. 10 . In the economic field the Government have decided to carry out crop assessments in respect of the 1944 wheat and barley harvests, but on different lines from last year. Instead of individual assessments, based on inspection of individual crops and the out-turn on the threshing floor, last year’s assessments are to be adjusted in accordance with crop conditions in the various areas a reduction of 20 to 30 per cent, being taken as a general guide. On balance this new system should give fairly adequate, though by no means ideal, results! I he Government will probably take over half the wheat crop again Their policy regarding barley, on the other hand, will be largely governed by the volume and pace of purchases by the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation. B\ nolding off the maiket until prices broke in April the Corporation after completing their 1943 contract to buy 200,000 tons at ID. 20/500 a ton at collecting centres, were able to purchase substantial quantities of barley at a pi ice equivalent to rather less than ID. 16/000 a ton. They were however obliged to suspend purchases at the end of April as there seemed’ to be no immediate prospect of moving the barley from Iraq owing to shippin cr difficulties while storage was proving difficult for the 50,000 odd tons already on hand in[54—61] b 2 3 Basra and the 30,000 tons coming forward. The market has since weakened further in view of the offerings of new barley. The suspension of purchases by the Corporation, coupled with the substantial fall in price, is naturally causing unfavourable comment among agricultural interests and, if serious resentment is to be avoided, it is essential that an early decision should be reached regarding the quantity of barley to be purchased for account of His Majesty’s Govern- ^^ment within the next twelve months and the price to be paid. While it is clear that the opportunity should be taken to get the price of barley down to a reasonable level in the general interest of Iraq, as well as our own, especially as other local products tend to fall in sympathy with it, the reduction should not be so drastic as to create undesirable political reactions. A proposal by the United States Minister that American shipping should be employed to lift barley to the Bed Sea/Suez area is at present under consideration in London and Cairo. 11 . On the 1st May Parliament passed a law creating a Ministry of Supply and thus gave sanction to a scheme advocated by Colonel Bayliss ever since his arrival in Iraq. There is much to be said for the concentration in one Ministry of Supply organisations hitherto dispersed among five different State departments, who have often not seen eye to eye in dealing with supply matters. The problem will, however, be to find adequate and suitably qualified staff for the new Ministry, which may also experience some difficulty in securing full co-operation from other Ministries unless the Minister of Supply is a strong but tactful personality. Nuri Pasha did not fill the post, there being few' aspirants to it in view of the inevitable unpopularity likely to be attached to the incumbent. 12 . Colonel Bayliss, who holds ambitious views and whose policy is all- embracing, is anxious that all supply questions should come under the control of the new Ministry and even that the control of all local products should be transferred to it from the Ministry of Interior. I understand, however, that he has waived his insistence in this respect as regards wheat and barley. It is largely this anxiety to get his hands on everything having any connexion with supplies and to set himself up as “economic dictator” of Iraq that has inevitably aroused serious opposition to him in Ministerial and British Advisory circles and recently caused me to send you. Sir, a warning that the Iraqi Government might ask him to go unless he showed himself more ready to seek and accept advice and to proceed with greater caution generally. He has continued to display commendable energy and resource, but his pace has tended to be too fast for a country such as Iraq with a comparatively primitive economy and a weak Administration in which, moreover, corruption has, unfortunately, become rife in the past few years. Nevertheless, as a result of his efforts, the general level of prices of certain imported goods has shown an appreciable drop over the past six months. 13. The main supply problem remains the shortage of cotton piece-goods, which is causing widespread anxiety and growing discontent, particularly in rural areas. The latter have so far received no cloth under the rationing scheme which, owing to the reduced supplies, has hitherto been limited to urban areas. Releases are now beginning in the country districts, but only, for the time being, on half the meagre scale enjoyed by towns. Coupled with the delay in distribution and coming on top of the differentiation between town and country rations of sugar, tea and coffee, this discrimination is causing increasing resentment in tribal areas. I have impressed upon Colonel Bayliss the need for making distribution as equitable as possible and have in particular emphasised the importance of not giving any other part of the country, e.g., Basra, earlier attention or more favourable treatment than the distressed Kurdish districts. 14. A development, which should promote ever closer co-ordination in supply matters between the Iraqi Government, the American Legation and this embassy, was the formation after protracted negotiations of a joint Anglo- American-Iraqi Committee for Co-ordination of Supplies under the chairman ship of the responsible Iraqi Minister. Both the embassy and the American Legation (also the Foreign Economic Administration) are represented on the committee, which held its first meeting on the 13th May. Meetings are to be held fortnightly and judging from the first two meetings they should provide opportunities for frank and profitable discussion of Iraq’s supply problems. 15. The parliamentary abuse unhappily directed against the Govern ment’s settlement with Mulla Mustafa had the unfortunate effect of dissuading the Cabinet from going steadily ahead with the plans propounded by theKurdish Minister without Portfolio, Majid Mustafa, for the paei ca . disturbed Kurdish areas. After the latter s return to Bagdad rom i in February, no fresh instructions were given to him and he remained m capital discouraged, disgruntled and constantly threatening o now up sponge. Meanwhile, the liaison officers, whom he had left behind to help the regular qaimmaqams and mudirs to restore tranquillity and reme } a minis 1 a tive defects, were without guidance, lost heart and began to ge ir f 0 rou :&gt; 1 e with the officials whom they were intended to assist. The Barzam tribal P^pn were quick to sense that something had gone wrong. The\ heaid 01 ie on a;ais of ill-feeling in Bagdad; they put the worst interpretation on Majid s failure to return to continue his work and they mistrusted tne Uo\einmeii s m en ions because they persisted in keeping garrisons at Mergasur and Bil e. , , . 16. The result was that unrest increased. The Barzams and men neighbours refused to surrender the rifles demanded from them an ie\ legan to show the familiar symptoms of sickening for an outbreak of violence of some 17 On the 13th April I received, by the hand of a special messenger, a letter from Mulla Mustafa complaining that the improvements in the Administration which had been promised were not being carried out, ana that Iraqi troops m the areas adjacent to Barzan were being reinforced instead of withdrawn and finally declaring that, provided that His Majesty’s Government had no objection, he and his people were prepared to win their rights ia ^ u s ‘, ,. 18. In reply, I sent him an oral message through Majid Mustafa stating that I was displeased to see that he was again interfering in politics in spite of his recent promises to me to keep quiet and restore the agricultural li e o his villages, and warning him of the serious consequences to himseli ol any thing he might do to embarrass His Majesty’s Government. 19 At this time the Minister of the Interior was away m the Mosul Liwa touring with the Regent, and, at my request, the Prime Minister spoke to him by telephone and invited him to make personal enquiries into the Barzam situation. Later on, the Prime Minister himself joined the Regent and accom panied His Royal Highness to Ruwanduz. It had been planned that the Regent should attend gatherings of the Kurdish clans, one near Amadiyah and the otnei near Ruwanduz. Unfortunately, the first had to be abandoned altogether, ana the second curtailed owing to bad weather. The chief result of the Regent s tour was that, after His Royal Highness and Nun Pasha had returned to Bagdad, the Prime Minister submitted a memorandum to the Lmir m wlucti He outlined the history of events in the Kurdish areas since the creation oi the Iraqi Kingdom and summarised the measures which he considerea should be ta \en o restore tranquillity and speed up the improvement of social services. I he Regen approved this memorandum, and on the 12th May the Prime Minister took Majid Mustafa with him on another tour in the north. Together they \isited Kirkuk, Mosul Arbil and Sulaimani. In each place the Prime Minister had talks with the officials and notables and set out the policy of the Government. He obtained from the mutasarrifs a report on the administrative reforms desirable m then respective liwas and accepted petitions from the local chiefs explaining then o-rievances His tour was rather too hurried and many of those whom he saw said openly that they had heard fair words before but had waited in vain for years for their fulfilment. Nevertheless, I think that his talks did do something to improve the temper of the people. Unhappily, soon after his return to Bagdad the whole Cabinet fell and much of the good impression left by the tour was 20 On the 22nd May Majid Mustafa and Major Kinch (Acting Political Adviser Northern Iraq)' visited Mulla Mustafa at Barzan. Both of them admonished the Mulla for his political restlessness and urged him to settle down quietly cultivate his lands and establish reasonable relations with the local authorities. Mulla Mustafa pressed for a general pardon for all his men, including police and army deserters, and for the withdrawal oi the army detach- ments at Bille and Mergasur. The mutasarrif explained that it was not practicable to pardon all classes of offenders who had joined Mulla Mustafa, but undertook to see what could be done to arrange that, it these men surrendered, they should receive considerate treatment. The military force at Mergasur was withdrawn early in June; that at Bille may be withdrawn later. Since the meeting described above, Mulla Mustafa has handed m nine of the 172 rifles which it is estimated he captured during the fighting last winter. , , 21. Meanwhile, inter-tribal fighting broke out m the Bradost nahiyah north of Ruwanduz. On the 17th May Khalifa Samad of the Bradost tribe attacked%\ l fip ,k e Sheikh Muhammad Sadiq (son of Saiyid Taha). The men °n' )C L 1 P ans ra ^ lec ^ to their leaders and a week later there was a skirmish, in which there were a few casualties on each side. Police reinforcements were t ic.e,liter sent to Ruwanduz, and the Qaimmaqam is endeavouring to arrange a Peace. Mulla Mustafa seems to have offered his help to both sides. 22. In Sulaimani General Baha Ud-din-Nuri has been doing good w’ork ideaning up the administration. Sheikh Latif, the son of Sheikh Mahmud, has ^■Pen persuaded to come back from Sardasht and arrived in Sulaimani on the l()th April. The people of Sardasht have written to many different quarters expressing their fear that Sheikh Latif’s departure will expose them to depreda tions by the Pizhder. Their fears are not altogether unfounded. 23. In the Mosul Liwa several troublesome tribal questions have worried the local authorities. A dispute between Sheikh Sfuq and his brother Ahmad, pi tiie Shammar, about the division of their late father’s estate divided the tribe into two camps, and the Mutasarrif of Mosul at one time felt obliged to take guarantees for good behaviour from the two protagonists and a number of lesser chiefs. This firm action had good results and at the end of April Sfuq and Ahmad came to an understanding. The terms of the settlement are, however, extremely vague and more is likely to be heard of this affair before long. The quarrel between the Aulad Faisal and the Aulad Shallal is another disturbing element in the internal affairs of the tribe and further action has been necessary to make the Aulad Shallal observe the settlement imposed by the authorities after the fighting that occurred in the late summer of 1942. There have also been frontier difficulties arising from fighting that has occurred in Syria between the Agaidat and some sections of the Shammar, in which the Iraqi Shammar became involved. A tribal conference which was to have been held in April and which Sheikh Sfuq, the leading sheikh of the Iraqi Shammar, was to have attended was in the end postponed, but a second attempt to get tribal arbitrators together at Tel Kotchek in early May, when the Mutasarrif of Mosul played a useful part, was more successful and resulted in the signing of peace terms between the warring tribes. This is not, however, the final chapter of the story and more trouble is probable before the terms of the peace are implemented. 24. In addition to these difficulties with the Shammar, there are outstanding disputes among the Yazidies which need careful handling and a serious feud between the Kurdish, Brifkani and the Muzuri tribes started by the abduction of Nuri Brifkani’s daughter by the son of Haji Malo of the Mazuri. Said Brifkani, the son of Nuri, has murdered Haji Malo and is now defying arrest with a large bodyguard of armed men. Efforts to persuade him to come in to submit to a tribal settlement have been unavailing and the police have not yet been able to capture him. It is difficult to dispose promptly of affairs of this kind, and while they drag on they are harmful and disturbing to the Administration. 25. The Amir Abdullah arrived in Bagdad on the 9th April and, after taking part in four days of elaborate official entertainment, he left with the Regent for a visit to the northern liwas. His Highness returned to the capital on the 21 st Aprd and left for Amman on the 27th April. When I called to see His Highness at the Palace he expatiated at length on what he termed the American menace. He was intensely suspicious of the expanding influence of the United States in the Levant States and disliked what he regarded as their support of Zionist pretensions. He thought that their proposals for exploiting the oil ■ resources of the Arabian peninsula were part of a plan to obtain a dominant politico-economic position in the Middle East. He said that he regarded these developments with alarm and did his best to make me share his apprehensions. My efforts to dissipate his fears had little success. Referring to Palestine. His Highness urged adherence to the White Paper of 1939, and he deplored the continued uncertainty of the future of Syria and the Lebanon under French influence. The Amir’s visit provoked a good deal of comment and speculation. The view generally taken seems to have been that he came to canvass support for his candidature to the Syrian throne. Though he did his best everywhere to be amiable, I do not think that he succeeded in enhancing his popularity, and reports which I have received indicate that in many quarters he enjoys little esteem. 26. A Lebanese delegation headed by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs parsed through Bagdad early in April on their way to visit King Abdul Azziz al Saud at Riyadh. They were received as official guests and were most cordially entertained during their three days’ stav in Bagdad. They returned to Bagdad on the 16th April and left the following evening by train for Syria. They professed themselves most favourably impressed by the wisdom of King Abdul Azziz al Saud and by the efficiency of his administration. It cannotbe doubted that while in Bagdad they had many talks with official and non-official Iraqi personalities about Arab Unity, but it is not likely that these talks progressed beyond the stage of formal expressions of support for the ideal of closer co-operation between the Arab countries. No official communique was issued in Bao;dad concerning the result of their visit either to Saudi Arabia or Iraq. 27. Two new diplomatic ministers have been accredited to the Iraqi Coui^^ M. Li Tieh Tseng, representing the Chinese Republic, presented his credentials on the 8 th April, and M. J. M. Kadlec, representing Czechoslovakia, was received in audience by the Regent for the same purpose three days later. Both reside in Tehran and are also accredited to the Shah. The Chinese Government have, however, taken a small house in Bagdad to serve as a legation, and the Minister intends to leave a secretary in charge. 28. Colonel Spillman, a member of the French Commissariat for Foreign Affairs at Algiers, arrived in Bagdad on the 10 th May, to establish contact with the Iraqi Government with a view to securing official recognition for the National Committee of Liberation. He told me that the Committee wished to have full representation in Bagdad. If, however, the Iraqi Government were at all hesitant about according recognition, the Committee would not be greatly perturbed but would await a more favourable opportunity. The change of Government has naturally interrupted his talks with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but I gather that the new Minister is favourably disposed to Colonel Spillman’s proposals. 29. The Regent has carried out several successful tours during the past two months. Between the 14th to 16th March he visited Hillah and the Holy Cities of Kerbela and Najaf and took with him the young King. The Royal Party was received with what appeared to be genuine enthusiasm by tribesmen and towns people alike, and all accounts testify to the pleasure which His Royal Highness gave by his gracious talks with the leading Divines. On the 25th March His Royal Highness went off to Basra on a visit which lasted until the 3rd April, and included an extensive tour of the Southern Desert area. Between the 13th and 21st April he toured Mosul, Arbil, Ruwanduz and Kirkuk, and on the 26th April he was at Rumaitha to open a new irrigation regulator. 30. The Iraqi people continue to react satisfactorily and with unshaken confidence to the course of the war. The news of the invasion of France, coming so closely after the fall of Rome, spread like wild-fire through Bagdad, and telephone calls on the 6 th June rose sharply by 40 per cent, over the normal. I have received numerous telegrams and other messages of congratulation. 31. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Minister Resident, Middle East, Political Intelligence Centre, Middle East, and the Government of India. I have, &amp;c.

Cornwallis to Mr. Eden.—(Received 5th April.) gj rj ^ Bagdad, ‘IMd March, 1944. ’ THE following are the chief events that have occurred in this country since the issue of my despatch No. 20 of the 13th January : 2. The inauspicious signs which attended the birth of the new Cabinet, formed on the 26th December, were not belied and its members soon became involved in difficulties with the Regent. The Ministers wished Parliament to be prorogued for two months to give them time to prepare the Budget and the Regent was asked to sign the necessary Iradah. Hearing of this development, some of the Deputies went to His Royal Highness and represented to him that the Cabinet’s request was only a manoeuvre to escape from the criticism of Parliament and that an adjournment would be inconvenient as the Deputies would thereby be obliged to come back to Bagdad at a time when it was important for many of them to be looking after the harvest. The Regent, who, from the beginning, has disliked the Cabinet, was persuaded by their arguments and refused to prorogue Parliament. He did not, however, 'discuss his reasons with the Acting Prime Minister, Taufiq Suwaidi, but merely sent a telephone message through the Chief of the Royal Diwan. This action upset Taufiq Suwaidi and some of his colleagues and they began to talk of being unable to remain in office unless they had the Regent’s support. They said that it was not fair of the Regent to appoint them Ministers and then to encourage their critics by openly showing his disfavour. On the 15th January, before leaving Bagdad for Basra, I had an audience with the Amir and discussed the situation with him. His Royal Highness told me that he was not satisfied with the Cabinet, though he did not want an immediate crisis. I warned him that the Ministers were not likely to continue to remain in office on sufferance and that unless he stepped carefully he would provoke a crisis whether he wanted it or not. I also emphasised how greatly the country needed a stable administration so that the Ministers might have time to give continuity to the work of their departments. I advised him that he should explain to Taufiq Suwaidi his reasons for not wishing to adjourn Parliament and to let it be known that he had not been influenced by lack of confidence in his Ministers. 3. His Royal Highness professed agreement with, but did not act upon, my advice. Contrary to the Cabinet’s wishes, the President of the Chamber called a meeting for the 22nd January and included on the agenda a new and amended Iradah appointing Taufiq Suwaidi Deputy Prime Minister. The latter (who had been left in charge when the Prime Minister went off for yet another cure in Palestine on the 10th January) was indignant and talked rather heatedly of immediate resignation. Mr. Edmonds, the adviser to the Ministry of the Interior, persuaded him, however, that the proper course for the Government was to face their critics regardless of the attitude of the Palace and he and his colleagues thereupon took courage and prepared for battle in the Chamber. When the time came Taufiq Suwaidi' made an excellent fighting speech, but his plan for the closure to be moved immediately afterwards was upset by the President, who abruptly adjourned the debate to the next meeting. In the meanwhile, the Government’s opponents in the Senate had made plans to move a resolution for the question of the constitutional legality of the appointment of a Deputy Prime Minister to be referred to the High Court under Article 83 of the Organic Law. When news of this development reached the Cabinet, they decided to anticipate it and to put an end to further discussion by themselves referring the problem to the High Court. This was done at the sitting held on the 24th January. A month later the members of the court were, in accordance with the Organic Law, elected by the Senate. Of the four Senators chosen, three are generally believed to hold the view that the appointment of a Deputy Prime Minister is unconstitutional; the opinions of the four judges are not known. At this stage Taufiq Suwaidi tendered his resignation in order that the High Court might £ 3. 5. o.o. \2 be free to take a decision without regard to the personal feelings of the incumbent of the challenged appointment. 4. Meanwhile, Nuri Said had returned on the 7th February from Palestine. A few days later he discussed the Cabinet’s position with the Regent, and enquired whether His Royal Highness wished him .to reform the Cabinet or whether he would prefer a new Prime Minister. On this point, the Regent has not yet really made up his mind. He has objections to every name that is put forward, but^i can suggest no suitable alternatives himself. Although the Cabinet contains some men of ability and is therefore, by Iraqi standards, fairly efficient, the Regent, not without reason, suspects the honesty and loyalty of three of its principal remaining members, Umar Nadhmi, Ali Mumtaz and Sadiq al Bassam. Moreover, the immediate and widespread unpopularity of the Cabinet, which has been notice able since it first came into office, is in the main a reaction against the inclusion of these three “ guilty men ” who, as members of the last Cabinet of Taha-al- Hashimi, are held to be partly responsible for the events which led up to Rashid Ali’s treason in 1941. The Regent’s difficulty is to find an alternative team. Ibrahim Kamal, the obvious candidate for the premiership, would want at least two of the politicians named above to whom the Regent has such strong objection, while the Lord Mayor of Bagdad, the only other aspirant who has been seriously considered, is too temperamental and hot-headed to be successful. His Royal Highness’s policy for the present is to give them a further period of trial and to judge their loyalty and capacity by the manner in which they carry out the business which he himself considers should be urgently undertaken. How long the Ministers will be willing to continue in office on such terms is not yet clear, but several of them have shown signs of wishing to resign rather thaiCcontinue to work under threat of dismissal. 5. On his return from Palestine the Prime Minister spoke to me appreciatively of the kindness shown to him by a number of non-political Jews and told me also that he had had a not unfriendly talk with Mr. Shertok. His Excellency was feted at both Beirut and Damascus. With the Syrian Government he claimed to have reached agreement in principle for the establishment of a close understanding between Syria and Iraq to include a common policy for defence and foreign affairs, whatever the other Arab States might agree to do. It was, he stated, also agreed that Nahas Pasha should be asked to form in March a small committee consisting of one or two representatives from each of the Arab States with which he had been in contact to draw up an agenda for the main conference which it was proposed should be held in Cairo in April or May. The conference would be attended only by official representatives and would decide on the form of federation to be adopted and the extent to which each country w T ould conform. Reports received from independent sources indicate that Nun’s understanding with Shukri Quwatli may be neither so firm nor so positive as he represented and it appears that the Syrian Government are in fact unlikely to take any step of this kind without first being assured that it has the approval of the other Arab countries, particularly Egypt and Saudi Arabia. Earlv in February the Iraqi Government promoted, their Charge d’Affaires in Syria' and the Lebanon to the rank of Minister Plenipotentiary. A small official Syrian delegation headed bv Jamil Beg Mardam arrived in Bagdad on the 19th March on their return journey from Riyadh, where they visited King Abdul Aziz al Sa’ud to discuss Arab unity. Jamil Beg told me that he was pleased and satisfied with the results of the visit but gave me no details of the results achieved. He and his party were cordially entertained by the Iraqi Government during their short stay in the Iraqi capital and were honoured with appropriate decorations by the Regent They left for Syria on the 20th March, travelling by railway via Mosul. 6 . About the middle of February the Prime Minister received news from the Iraqi Legation in Washington of a resolution presented to Conoress bv Senator Wagner demanding that the United States Government should use their good offices to create a Jewish Commonwealth in Palestine and abrogate the White Papei. Nun 1 asha at first kept all mention of this development out of the Iraqi newspapers, but he sent for the American Minister and told him that the Iraqi Government would protest. Mr. Henderson advised against official action by the Go\oinment and suggested that, if the Prime Minister was determined that Iraqi disapproval of the resolution should be voiced, the Senate and the Chamber should pass votes of protest in the same wav that they had done at the time of the crisis m the Lebanon. A few days later the President of the Senate sent a cable to Senator Wagner m Washington protesting in dignified terms against the resolution, and the President of the Chamber sent a shorter, but similar, message to the same addressee. Both telegrams were repeated to Senator Taft![52—44] B 2 3 the Foreign Affairs Committee of the United States Senate and to the Egyptian and Syrian Governments. These telegrams were followed by another to the Speaker of the House of Representatives at Washington, which was signed by the Presidents of both Houses of the Iraqi Parliament. This later message was couched in more emphatic terms, contained exaggerated statements about the implications of the Wagner resolution and declared that its adoption would be tantamount to a request by Congress for an American declaration of war on the Arabs of Palestine. The Prime Minister explained to me that this further protest had been prepared after the receipt from the United States Minister of the full text of the Wagner resolution, the terms of which had caused the Presidents of the Senate and Chamber to feel that their earlier representations had not been phrased with sufficient emphasis. All these cables were shown to the Saudi Arabian Minister, who no doubt kept his King informed of their despatch. The texts were not, however, given to the Iraqi press, but on the 1 st March, after the Egyptian Government had made public the fact that they had protested to the United States Government, the Iraqi Press Directorate put out a communique informing the public of the action taken by the Presidents of the Iraqi Senate and Chamber. Afterwards the Arabic press took up the theme and each newspaper contributed to the chorus of pain and indignation that ensued. On the whole, these articles were restrained in their language, and their key-note was a call to the Governments of Great Britain and the United States speedily to make official pronouncements on their policy towards Palestine which would put an end finally to the present state of nervous tension and uncertainty which had for so long been a menace to the tranquillity of the Middle East. The Minister for Foreign Affairs called on me on the 6 th March to speak about Field-Marshal Smuts’s message to the Zionist Federation of Great Britain and Ireland. This message, he told me, had been kept out of the Iraqi press, but it had been published in Egypt and a protest had been made by the Arab Union Club in Cairo. It was therefore bound to become known in Iraq. He explained that such a message from an honoured figure like Field-Marshal Smuts was bound to be very disturbing to the Arabs, and especially to the Iraqis, who were at all times sensitive to news concerning Palestine. 7. Mulla Mustafa, the insurgent Barzani chieftain, came in to Mergasur on the 8 th January to meet Majid Mustafa, the Minister without Portfolio charged with the improvement of the administration in the northern liwas. On the 14th January Majid Mustafa arrived in Bagdad to report to the Cabinet. He made the following proposals :— (a) That Mulla Mustafa should be allowed to live in a village to be deter mined by the Government, outside the Barzan tribal area. \b) That his brother, Sheikh Ahmad, and the other Barzani chieftains and their families and followers, who had been sent to live in Hilla, should be permitted to return to their homes. (c) That chosen Kurdish officers of the Iraqi army should be appointed to carry out special duties as “ liaison officers ” under Majid Mustafa and to continue the work of pacification in the disturbed area, (d) That grain should be sent up to the Barzan and neighbouring areas and that relief works should be organised on the roads. (e) That the Iraqi army detachments should be withdrawn from Mergasur. but that certain police posts should be re-established. Before the end of the month the Government had accepted all these proposals, and early in February Majid Mustafa went oft again northwards to gBe effect to them. In the meanwhile, Sheikh Ahmad and his party (eighty-six persons in all) returned to their homes. A fortnight later Mulla Mustafa arri\ed in Bagdad to make formal submission to the Regent. With him came a dozen or more chieftains of tribes who are neighbours of the Barzanis. Ihe^ weie sent down by Majid Mustafa apparently with the idea of giving Mulla Mustafa confidence. This object was no doubt achieved, but the effect of their coming was, in other ways, not altogether happy. Their presence in Bagdad naturally attracted a good deal of attention and comment and provided ammunition for criticism of the Government, which, as I have related above, was used with effect in the Senate. Majid Mustafa has been doing good work in all the northern liwas. He has established the former Acting Chief of the General Staff as Mutessarif in Sulaimani and has found another man with a good reputation for Arbil. He has himself set about settling several complex tribal quarrels which threatened the peace in several different districts, and he. has pushed ahead with4 energy the distribution of grain to the hungry villagers in all of the three liwas of Mosul, Arbil and Sulaimani. He has, moreover, succeeded in recovering a considerable number of the rifles which the Government distributed to certain of the tribes in the hope of encouraging them to resist the Barzanis. the cessation of fighting and the progress of Majid Mustafa’s work of pacification has made it possible to withdraw the British Indian troops and armoured cars from Diyana, and the Iraqi army have also been able to recall most of thej^ additional troops which they sent to Barzan and its neighbourhood last autumn. 8 . Colonel Bayliss’s rationing system for tea and coffee introduced on the 1st January has made fairly good progress in the large towns, where the ration for January and February, and in the case of Bagdad and Mosul for March also, has been distributed to nearly all coupon-holders. In the smaller towns and country districts, however, distribution of tea and coffee, as well as sugar, is much behind schedule and there are numerous small districts where no distribution has yet been made. It was not to be expected that the scheme could operate from the outset except in the larger towns, and even in some of these, such as Basra, serious teething troubles were encountered. The provincial administration, inexperienced in detailed supply work and undermined by corruption arising mainly from the inability of officials to make their salaries cover the mounting cost of living, has inevitably been overwhelmed by the spate of instructions associated with the rationing scheme. Nevertheless mutessarifs seem to be interpreting their instructions as best they can and, while uniformity is lacking, most of them are at least endeavouring to apply the rationing policy in the light of local conditions. The political advisory staff are giving the local administration all possible advice and assistance in this important matter and continue to help to clear up the many difficulties which arise. 9. Rationing of textiles began in Bagdad on the 1 st March. In view of the greater complexity of the textile scheme, which is based on a form of points, it was decided to restrict it to the capital in the first place and extend it as the supply organisation permitted. Although stocks of textiles will as a result still remain frozen outside the capital and there is much grumbling concerning the delay in getting textiles in the provinces, it was prudent to make sure that the system would work before applying it throughout the country. About 200 retail shops have been selected for retail distribution in Bagdad and they are said to be working satisfactorily on the whole. The public seem to have discovered surprisingly quickly how to use the coupons and have no doubt been greatly assisted in this respect by the propaganda both in the press and on the radio which has been undertaken by the Government on a scale hitherto unknown in Iraq. 10 . Price control continues to embrace an increasing number of imported commodities, the principles of fixed maximum selling prices or fixed profits being used according to the class of the commodity. In Bagdad at least the price control restrictions appear to be fairly widely observed, some prosecutions having had a salutary effect. A more cogent factor is probably a growing knowledge that the reorganised supply administration under Colonel Bayliss and his British staff really mean business. It is not surprising therefore that the prices of uncontrolled commodities have also shown a slightly downward trend. 11 . In my despatch No. 20 of the 13th January I reported that there was a tendency for Colonel Bayliss to rush his fences as Economic Adviser to the High Supply Council and Director-General of Imports. He also gave the impression that he was trying to set himself up as “ economic dictator of Iraq,” an attitude which at one time caused considerable friction with the other British Advisers and eventually with the Minister of Finance. The issue became acute at the end of January as a result of a discourteous letter addressed to the latter by Colonel Bayliss. I was therefore obliged to intervene and spoke to Colonel Bavliss in no uncertain terms, pointing out to him that he must not adopt dictatorial tactics and that he would need all the co-operation he could get from other British officials. On my recommendation he withdrew the offending letter and apologised to the Minister of Finance. He has since been more amenable and more willing to seek and accept advice, more particularly from the political advisory staff. He continues to show commendable energy and resource and, despite staff diffi culties, is pressing ahead with control measures with the promisin 0, results indicated above. . &amp; 12 . Colonel Bayliss is, of course, being bitterly attacked by the merchants who are making every effort to undermine his position. He has, on the other hand' enjoyed a good local Arab press which reflects the ordinary man’s sympathv with(&lt;&gt;? 5 the steps he is taking to reduce the cost of living. The Public Relations Section of the Embassy is co-operating with him in arranging publicity, but the generally good tone of the press seems to be quite spontaneous. 13. One of the most interesting economic features during the past two months has been the downward trend in the prices of local produce, except meat, poultry, vegetables and fruit. The decline has ranged from 10 to 20 per «tent., being most marked in wheat and dates. This healthy development has not oeen due to control measures, but mainly to the waiting policy which has been deliberately pursued in acquiring for His Majesty’s Government barley and dates for export. The United Kingdom Commercial Corporation or their agents have purchased 230,000 tons of barley or 30,000 tons more than the amount contracted for with the Iraqi Government last year, when, owing to emergency demands for India and elsewhere, there was no option but to fork out what local vested interests thought suitable. This year the boot, for the time being at any rate, is on the other foot—the Iraqis want to sell their remaining surplus, and so far there has been no panic demand from Cairo or anywhere else. The United Kingdom Commercial Corporation have recently offered to buy at ID. 16 per ton (the ruling market price), but the Government insisted on ID. 18/500, with the result that the negotiations broke down and the Government freed the market, subject to the maintenance of the maximum price of ID.20/500, and also export, though the latter facility is merely a nominal gesture to holders of barley since practically all transport out of the country is controlled by His Majesty’s Govern ment. Meanwhile, the U.K.C.C. are now endeavouring to buy on the open market at a price equivalent to about ID. 17 per ton at collecting centres. It is regrettable and inconsistent that the Prime Minister, while giving every support to measures aimed at reducing the prices of imported goods, should have assured Parliament on the 19th March that he hoped to secure a substantially higher price for the surplus Iraqi barley than the market price of ID.16. 14. The Euphrates date-growers have at last realised the folly of hanging on to their 1943 season dates in the hope of securing excessive prices and have reached an agreement to sell the remaining surplus of the 1943 crop to Messrs. Andrew Weir and Company for account of the Ministry of Food at a price of ID.20 per ton, which is more than 30 per cent, lower than their demand six months ago. 15. With the substantial decrease in British military expenditure in Iraq and a considerable fall in the price of major local produce, there is some prospect of slowing down, if not checking, the inflationary trend, provided that heavy and urgent demands are not suddenly made, as they have been in the past, foV the export of cereals irrespective of price. Even if the prices of local produce did not fall further, but remained at the present slightly lower levels, the reduc tion should prove in practice a more important deflationary factor than the issue of internal loans up to a total of ID.2 million now under consideration by the Council of Ministers. 16. Iraqi pilgrims returning from the Hejaz in January brought with them stories of the summary execution of a Persian (Shi’ah) pilgrim for the alleged pollution of the precincts of the Haram at Mecca. The Shi’ahs main tained that the unfortunate man had involuntarily vomited into his “ ihram ” and had thereafter been judicially murdered by Ibn Sand’s orders on a fabricated charge of having befouled the holy precincts. The Sunnis made no complaint about the man’s treatment and accepted the official version that he had been punished for a disgusting sacrilege. In the Holy Cities there was a great stir and the Chief Mujtahid at Najaf, Saiyid Albu Hassan al Isfahani, telegraphed to the Shah of Persia begging him not to be silent but to have the matter fully investigated. The more fanatical elements also brought pressure to bear on the former to make some form of pronouncement condemning the action of the Saudi Government. On the occasion of the Arbain pilgrimage to Kerbala on the 15th February many of the processions chanted slogans against Ibn Sand and against the Wahabis, but there were no disorders and interest in the affair is now waning. 17. Towards the end of January measures adopted by the Iraqi Govern ment to prevent the smuggling of sheep from Iraq to Syria and Transjordan via Saudi Arabia, caused some tension in Saudi-Iraqi relations. The trouble be^an when the Iraqi Government gave notice to the Saudi Legation that all Saudi tribesmen entering Iraq to graze their flocks should register the number of their sheep with the Iraqi frontier authorities. The purpose of this measure was not only to put a check on the acquisition by these tribesmen of more sheep in Iraq which they could take away with them when they returned to Saudi Arabia-, butalso to safeguard bona fide Saudi grazers from coming under suspicion by enabling them at any time to show that the sheep with them had been brought into Iraq from their own country. Ibn Saud unfortunately did not understand the scheme and quite wrongly regarded it as a new and ingenious plan for perse cuting his tribesmen. His Majesty protested violently and threatened to take reciprocal “offensive” action against Iraqi tribesmen grazing their flocks in Saudi Arabia. So soon as the trouble was brought to my notice, I explained the*** Iraqi Government’s purpose to the Saudi Minister and I also discussed the matter with the Iraqi Minister of Finance, whose department was responsible for the initiation of the plan to register sheep crossing the Saudi frontier. A few days later the Saudi Minister and the Minister of Finance talked the whole matter over together and the latter offered to work out jointly with the Saudi Government an alternative scheme to stop smuggling. Meanwhile, the original proposals do not seem to have been put into effect, and as, for purely economic reasons, it seems probable that the ban on the export of sheep will soon be lifted, I think it is reasonable to consider the incident as now closed. 18. A Chinese Goodwill Mission arrived in Bagdad on the 29th February, having travelled from London by way of Egypt, Turkey and Persia. The three members, Messrs. Wang, Han and Wen, were entertained to dinner by the Iraqi Government and lunched at the Embassy. They left Bagdad for Basra by air on the 2nd March. During their short stay they were treated as official guests and shown every courtesy and attention, creating themselves a very happy impression. 19. The Polish Minister of State in the Middle East also visited Iraq in February. The Iraqi Government gave a dinner party in his honour, and I also had the pleasure of entertaining his Excellency. 20. During the period covered by this despatch several events outside Iraq have attracted a good deal of local attention. I have already mentioned the Wagner resolution on Palestine. Another event in the United States that has quite naturally been much discussed was the statement made by Mr. Ickes and elaborated in the American press about American plans for the further develop ment of the oil-fields in Saudi Arabia. Koweit and Bahrein. Some doubts have been expressed here whether a big increase in American interests in the Arab countries would be beneficial to Arab nationalism and the suggestion was put about that Ibn Saud was making the mistake of trying to free himself from financial dependence on Great Britain and turn for help to the United States instead. Among the Jews, however, the prospect of the growth of American enterprise in Iraq and the neighbouring Arab countries seems to have been welcomed. Many Jews are greedily absorbing United States propaganda and are beginning to think that if America’s Middle Eastern capital interests develop she will play a bigger part in Middle East politics and that the minorities will thereby have a new safeguard against the danger of Arab oppression. Increasing United States interest in this part of the world is very noticeable, but is not in my view to be regretted, since the growth of overseas responsibilities must surely tend to undermine steadily the ingrained isolationism of the American people. I cannot but feel that the withdrawal of the Wagner reso lution, following the representations of the State Department, General Marshal and others, is a significant pointer in this direction. 21 . A keen eye is always turned from Iraq towards Turkey, and when in February it was seen that military consultations between Turkey and the Allies had been broken off the political gossips had an ideal topic to exploit. Generally, the sudden withdrawal of the British military experts seems to have been regarded as a set-back for Allied diplomacy, and on the whole sympathy was with Turkey in her reluctance to enter the war. The later news that Great Britain and America had stopped supplies of war materials, including aviation spirit, to Turkey stimulated still further interest in Turkey’s relations with the Allies. It is generally considered here that Turkey’s attitude has been influenced by the unfortunate set-back suffered by British arms in Samos, Cos and Eeros, and the slow progress of the campaign in Italy. 22 . The war review given by Mr. Churchill on the 22nd February provided many topics for talk from which people chose according to their fancy. The malicious tried to make much of his statement that he gave no guarantee that the war would end in 1944, the better-disposed retorted by pointing out that Mr. Churchill had been equally cautious about any guarantees the 'other way. The gloomy ones found reason for more gloom in the Prime Minister’s warning that German retaliation for British air raids would increase, but the optimistic confidently seized on his assurance that the Allied air attacks on Germany would reach a degree of intensity far beyond anything yet achieved or imagined'. Your52 ■gpHi 7 own statement, Sir, replying to a question in the House of Commons on the 16th February, on the present situation of the Iraqi Government was a further source of animated discussion. Unfamiliar as they are with the astonishing irrelevancy of many parliamentary questions, especially those dealing with foreign countries, the Iraqis sought to deduce the reason for the question put to you and ingeniously invented a variety of theories, all very far from the truth, ^gome decided that both the question and the answer were concerned with the competence of the present Cabinet, others thought that their purpose was to reveal dissatisfaction with Iraqi war collaboration, while among the minorities there were those who saw in your reply a sinister repudiation by His Majesty’s Govern ment of all interest in their fate. Talk on these lines did not last for long, though some of its effects may linger, nor was it active enough to influence to any consider able extent the ordinary course of local events. It was nevertheless significant because it showed how sensitive many people in Iraq are to any statements made in high British places touching themselves or their interests, and also how much the field of public opinion has been widened in recent years by the expansion of broad casting and the development of other instruments of publicity and propaganda. 23. Rainfall this winter has been below the average throughout the country, but its effects are particularly noticeable in the southern areas, where in many cases flocks have had to be grazed on growing crops. It is estimated that the harvest will be some 25 per cent, less than last season, and that livestock will suffer severely. It is also feared that the coming hot weather will be punctuated by frequent dust storms. 24. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Minister Resident in the Middle Fast, Cairo, the Government of India, the Political Intelligence Centre, Middle East, and to His Majesty’s Consular Officers at Basra and Mosul.

K&lt;j/jL ku*/ (No. 20.) gi r Bagdad, VMh January, 1944. I HAVE the honour to submit, with reference to my r desp atch No 401 of the ^ ^3 12th November. 1943. an account of the chief events that have taken place in Iraq during the last two months. 2. The Regent returned on the 12th December from his official visit to the United Kingdom. His Royal Highness was delighted with the kindly welcome which he received everywhere he went, and especially pleased with the gracious friendship shown to him by the King and Queen while he was Iheir Majesties guest at Buckingham Palace. On his arrival in Bagdad he was given a very hearty reception by the people of the capital, who thronged both sides of the streets through which he drove from the airport to the palace in company with the young King and the Amir Said. 3. The extraordinary session of Parliament which began on the 9th October was prorogued on the 30th November and the ordinary session for 1943/44 was opened by the Acting Regent on the 1st December, i have already reported by telegram the chief points of the unusually long speech from the throne, and need not recapitulate them here. The ambitious programme of administrative activity which it contained was well received in the press and by the public, though the latter, with some reason, are reported to have voiced doubts whether any consider able portion of the programme would, in fact, be carried out. The promises of a new electoral law and of encouragement for the setting up of responsible political parties aroused especial interest. The young men of the Left wing were pleased with the prospect of greater scope for political ability and have hopes of stronger representation when the next elections are held. 4 . The arrest of the Lebanese President, Prime Minister and Cabinet on the 11th November by the French authorities in the Levant provoked a strong; reaction m Iraq. All classes resented this action as an attack on the established liberties of the Lebanese State and despised it as an exhibition of clumsy brutality by a nation which, with its own country still occupied by an enemy army, is in their view little fitted to lord it over others. There was at once a demand for action to support the Lebanese Government. The Senate and the Chamber held special meetings on the 13th November, at which resolutions were passed and com municated to all the Allied and neutral Governments, protesting against the suspension of the Lebanese Constitution and the arrest of the President and members of the Government. At the same time the newspapers called upon the Allied Governments to intervene to compel the French National Committee to respect the pledges given to Syria and the Lebanon and to uphold the principles of the Atlantic Charter. The Acting Regent also made formal protests to myself and the United States Charge d’AfPaires. 5 . The release and reinstatement of the President, the freeing of the arrested Cabinet Ministers on the 22nd November and their subsequent resumption of office brought tension to an end, but profound mistrust of French motives and methods remains. What is known of the part played by His Majesty’s Govern ment and what is guessed of what went on behind the scenes has generally redounded to the credit of Britain, but there are always a few people who are too clever to accept the obvious and who have ascribed a variety of Machiavellian motives to our policy during the Lebanese crisis. 6 . The Iraqi Government were wise enough to restrain, rather than excite, public opinion. Demonstrations were prohibited and the exuberance of the press checked, but both the Government and thinking people have found in the Lebanese struggle with the French new and cogent reasons for closer political co-operation among the Arab States. 7. The Colonial Secretary’s statement on the 10 th November, that the 31,000 Jewish immigrants who could legally enter Palestine before the end of March [50—39] f /*&amp;&lt;*** O.C2 1944 will be allowed to enter after the expiry of the time-limit, waft received in Iraq without adverse comment. I must emphasise that the reactions here, in Egypt and elsewhere to the Lebanese crisis illustrate clearly what is to be expected on a far graver scale if or when trouble starts in Palestine. 8 . Soon after the Regent's return from his visit to the United Kingdom the Prime Minister took up with His Royal Highness the question of reforming his Cabinet. The discussions continued for some time, but the many permutations and combinations that were considered had only ephemeral interest and need permanent record. The new Cabinet was eventually formed on the 26th December with the following members :— Prime Minister and Acting Minister of Defence : Nuri al Said. Deputy Prime Minister : Taufiq Suwaidi. Foreign Affairs : Mahmud Subhi al Daftari. Interior : Umar Nadhmi. Finance : Ali Mumtaz. Justice : Ahmad Mukhtar Baban. Communications and Works : Sadiq al Bassam. Education : Abdul Illah Hafidh. Economics : Salman al Barrak. Social Affairs : Muhammad Hassan Kubbi. Minister without Portfolio: Majid Mustafa. 9. The novel features of the new Cabinet, made possible by the recent amend ment to the Organic Law, are the inclusion of a Deputy Prime Minister and a Minister without Portfolio. I think Nuri Pasha chose Taufiq Suwaidi in the hope that he would relieve him of a lot of parliamentary work, but I fear that Taufiq will prove to be an uneasy colleague and I shall be surprised if he does not, before long, try to squeeze Nuri out. There are others, too, in the Cabinet who would be willing to take part in an intrigue of this kind. Majid Mustafa is a genuine Kurd and has the special task of appeasing the Kurdish areas and redres sing their administrative grievances. Most of the other members have been chosen for their former experience, or for their skill in debate, while Mohammad Hassan Kubba is a new recruit to fill the usual Shiah quota of three Ministers. He has won a good reputation as a judge. No progressive men have been introduced and as a whole the Cabinet represents the old ruling class of established families rather than any of the new elements now knocking at the door of public life. The return of Salman al Barrak to the Cabinet left the office of President of the Chamber vacant. It was filled a few days later when a large majority of the Deputies voted for the Shiah Deputy, Saiyid Ridha Shababi. Only a few days after the new Cabinet had been got together the Prime Minister told me that the Regent had been criticising its members. His Royal Highness was in particular dissatis fied with the inclusion of Taufiq Suwadi. Ali Mumtaz and to a lesser extent Muhammad Hassan Kubba. In reply Nuri Pasha had, he said, suggested that it was only fair to give the new Ministers a chance until, say, the end of March when, if His Royal Highness was not satisfied, the Cabinet could resign. He had, how ever, begged the Regent to be sure that a better Cabinet could be formed before he broke up the existing combination. 10 . The public reception given to the new Cabinet was far from good, though the reasons for its immediate unpopularity are not easy to see. In make up it is hardly distinguishable from innumerable earlier Cabinets and its promise, if no better, is no worse than the average of its predecessors. I am left to suppose that political enlightenment is spreading and that the Iraqi public are now applying more exacting tests to their Cabinets than were customary in the past. This in some ways is all to the good, but I fear that they will find it difficult to discover a body of Ministers who will come up to these new standards. 11 . In Parliament, too, the Cabinet have had to face much criticism. The assault was launched during the debate on the reply to the Speech from the Throne which opened on the 3rd January and ended on the 6 th January. In the Chamber bitter personal attacks were made on members of the Cabinet and every point of the Speech from the Throne was hotly discussed. In the Senate the constitutional legality of the appointment of a Deputy Prime Minister was the chief bone of contention, but there also many members found the opportunity convenient to mount their own particular hobby-horses and tilt at the Government. It is too early yet to assess what, if any, serious damage the Cabinet have sustained by these onslaughts, but with the Regent ill-disposed towards them and determined opponents in both Houses of Parliament the immediate outlook for the Adminis tration is not bright. The continued indisposition of the Prime Minister is an8 additional handicap. He left for sanatorium treatment at Haifa on the 10 th January and in his absence Taufiq Suwaidi, who has none of Nun s personal popularity, will probably find his position as head of the Government anything but easy. In conversation with the Regent and other local personalities I have urged that the country needs more than anything a period of political stability enabling Ministers to grasp the work of their departments and so get down to constructive action on the many problems awaiting attention. While His Royal Highness has reluctantly agreed to give the present Cabinet a trial, I fear it will be many years before Iraqis as a whole acquire sufficient public spirit to place country before self. 12. Three new Senators were appointed on the 30th December, Muhammad Amin Zaki, the veteran Kurdish politician, who has frequently held a Cabinet position; Muhammad Saihud, a wealthy tribal leader of Kut; and Abdul Razzaq al Mir, a notable of Basra. 13. In my despatch No. 397 of November 1943, I reported the frank talk that ^ f I had had with the Prime Minister about the deplorable decline in the administra tion of the country. Since then I have lost no opportunity of impressing upon his Excellency and other Iraqi personalities the urgent need of improving this state of affairs. The necessity for remedial measures with outside help is now widely accepted, but Nuri Pasha has been confronted, when considering bringing about reforms through the employment of British officers in tlm administrative inspectorate, by the very real difficulty of finding suitable men. To overcome this obstacle I proposed in early January that the existing political advisory staff created in 1941 might carry out in addition to its ordinary duties those of administrative inspection under the Ministry of the Interior for a provisional period of six months. The Cabinet are now studying this offer. 14. The Edmonds Committee on internees finished their work early in December. Their recommendations were adopted and on the 6 th December, two days before the great festival of Td al Adha, it was officially announced that fifty-one men had been released from the internment camp at Amara. I should perhaps mention here that the publicity attending the release from prison in the United Kingdom of the Moseley couple will not make it easier for me to resist the importunities of local politicians who would like to open the gates of Amara. 15. I am pleased to be able to report that on this occasion no untoward incidents attended the committee’s work and no attempt was made by any highly placed persons to influence the committee’s recommendations. 16. During November the Prime Minister discussed with me the question of the return to Iraq of the Iraqi internees now in Southern Rhodesia. The upshot of our talks was that the Iraqi Government formally renewed their request for the surrender of all of these internees and gave me a written assurance that those not tried and sentenced for their offences would be interned again in Iraq. The Prime Minister also confirmed to me orally that all his colleagues agreed to this policy. When the Cabinet was changed at the end of December the Prime Minister again obtained the agreement of all the Ministers to the resolution adopted by their predecessors concerning these men. 17. For nearly a month after the fighting that ended on the 11 th November there were no further engagements with the tribesmen in the Barzan area. The Iraqi army detachments remained in their camps and the tribesmen took no offensive action. On the 7th December, however, a strong tribal force opened an attack on a police post at Shaitana, situated about 3 miles off the Ruwanduz- Mergasur road, just to the north of Mazna. The post surrendered after holding out for only three days, though the garrison had suffered no casualties. The tribesmen are reported to have obtained twenty-three rifles, one light automatic and 10.000 rounds of small-arms ammunition from this post. 18. On the 8 th December a small body of about ten to twelve policemen under an inspector was ambushed while moving from Sideka police post to Diyana. Most of them were killed after a spirited fight and about two days later the Barzani tribesmen began an attack on Kani Rash, the nahiyah headquarters of the Baradost nahiyah. About the same time sporadic attacks were started on the Iraqi Army camp at Mergasur. 19. In the meanwhile, the Assyrians who make up the bulk of the inhabitants of the village of Diyana, situated near Ruwanduz, had become anxious for their safety, and on the 10th December it was arranged in agreement with the Prime Minister, the Air Officer Commanding and General Headquarters, Persia / Iraq Force, that the Area Liaison Officer at Arbil should proceed to Diyana with four Royal Air Force armoured cars to give them confidence. A week later a small force consisting of four more Royal Air Force armoured cars, a company of British- [50—39 b 2V 4 Indian infantry, one mortar platoon and one Bren-carrier platoon was sent up to provide protection for both Diyana and the neighbouring village of Balikian. The arrival of these troops had an immediately steadying effect, and they were warmly welcomed by the inhabitants. 20. On the 14th December the Prime Minister, anxious to be conciliatory, persuaded Shaikh Ahmad Barzan (brother of Mulla Mustafa) to send his own son with a message informing Mulla Mustafa that if he would leave the area of hostilities and go elsewhere to live quietly until next spring, he would then be ^ pardoned and permitted to return to live in his own villages. The reply received a week later was a refusal, and it was evident that Mulla Mustafa’s recent successes had put him into an exalted mood I thereupon thought it well with your authority to send him a warning that the situation in the Barzan area was becoming an embarrassment to the war effort of His Majesty’s Government, and that if he continued his present disorderly activities, they would be obliged to consider his intentions as unfriendly and act accordingly. I received a replv on the 29th December. After reiterating his readiness at all times to obey the British Government, for whom he expressed his deep affection in eloquent terms, he went on to refer to his grievances and to appeal to me to “ instruct ” the Iraqi Govern ment to pardon him and to release the other Barzan Chieftains and their followers now detained at Hill a. If this were done he pledged himself to keep the peace and maintain order. The composition of his letter was involved, but it was clear Mulla Mustafa sought to be left in undisturbed control of the Barzan tribal area. For the present I have thought it best not to continue the correspondence, but in a long talk which I had with Majid Mustafa, the new Kurdish Minister without Portfolio, on the 31st December, I explained Mulla Mustafa’s attitude and discussed at length the chief aspects of the tribal situation in the North. Majid Mustafa indicated that his first aim would be to try to conclude an agreement which would end hostilities. He set out from Bagdad on the 1 st January with the intention of going to Arbil to study the situation and to get into touch with many Kurdish Chiefs who are personal friends and thus to make direct contact with Mulla Mustafa. On the 5th January the officer commanding at Mergasur reported the receipt of a letter, in which Mulla Mustafa had stated that he would withdraw his men from the vicinity of Kani Rash and Mergasur, and would be pleased to meet Majid Mustafa at the latter pace. 21. Colonel Bayliss (formerly of the Middle East Supply Centre) was appointed Economic Adviser to the High Supply Council and Director-General of Imports on the 22nd November with a staff of five officers, each of whom is in charge of a section of the reorganised Directorate-General of Imports wRh the title of Controller and with executive powers. At the instigation of Colonel Bayliss several new committees have been established including a Price Control Committee and a Traders Co-ordination Committee, Colonel Bayliss being chair man in each case. The second committee reflects the policy of the new directorate to keep in close touch with merchants, and to use trade channels as far as possible for distribution. The formation of a Joint Anglo-American-Iraqi Committee for the Co-ordination of Importing Supplies is under consideration, and may shortly be approved by the Government despite some opposition. Such a committee would, of course, facilitate tasks such as the screening of import requirements and the supervision of controls over imported goods. A further contemplated development is the establishment of a Ministry of Supply, in which supply organisations at present scattered over several Ministries will be concentrated. The further steps taken, since Colonel Bayliss’s appointment, to control the prices of imported goods are best set out chronologically. 22. On the 25th November the Ministry of Finance published a notification calling upon all importers and wholesale and retail dealers in cotton and wojlen goods of all kinds, both new and second hand, to register their stocks, and ordering the suspension of all wholesale dealing in those goods until further notice. A similar notification was published on the same day concerning tea and coffee. 23. On the 15th December a notification was published by the Price Control Committee fixing retail prices for the principal varieties of cotton cloth, grey cloth, white cloth, prints and flannelettes. This was followed soon afterwards by similar notifications fixing the prices of tea and coffee, second-hand clothing, certain steel building materials, carbon paper, typewriter ribbons and electric bulbs. Explanatory statements accompanied these notifications, making it clear in simple language their intention and scope, and calling upon the public to co-operate with the authorities in giving effect to the steps that were being taken to bring down prices. Heavy penalties were prescribed for retailers who refused to sell at the official prices.30. According to Nuri Pasha his discussions with Jamil Mardam on Arab unity resulted in agreement between the two Premiers to work for the realisation of the Arab League envisaged in Nuri Pasha’s letter to Mr. Casey last summer. I myself very much doubt, however, whether the Syrian Government are yet ready to go anything like so far towards federation as is contemplated in that document. 31. Mr. Loy W. Henderson presented his credentials as Minister Plenipo tentiary of the United States on the 20 th November. He is the first American Minister of this rank accredited to the Iraqi Government. His predecessors wero^^* only Ministers Resident. Relations with the American Legation continue to be most friendly and helpful. 32. Christmas provided numberless Iraqis with a new opportunity to express their good will towards their British Ally. Many subscribed handsomely to the fund which my wife and I opened to provide presents for the sailors, soldiers, airmen and merchant navy seamen in this command, hundreds sent telegrams and cards of greeting and good wishes to myself and members of my staff and official friendship was symbolised by a huge party given by the Prime Minister and the Iraqi Government to seven hundred British soldiers at the Town Hall, Bagdad. Addressing his guests the Prime Minister said “ This happy gathering will I trust be a symbol of the unity and mutual understanding of our peoples which will endure long after this war has been brought to an end.'’ The King and the Regent sent greetings and good wishes to the guests, and the Queen- Mother gave beautifully iced cakes for the Christmas party at Noah’s Ark. one of the troops’ restaurants run by voluntary workers from the British civil community. All these gestures were spontaneous expressions of friendly feeling, and make a happy contrast with the state of public opinion in this country at the beginning of 1941. At the same time, and while I do not doubt that Anglophobia is now at a heavy discount in educated circles, it may perhaps be wise to temper our satisfaction over this gratifying state of affairs by not forgetting that anxiety to be on the winning side is a striking feature of the Arab character. 33 . I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s representatives at Cairo, Angora, Tehran, Jedda and Beirut, the Minister of State Resident in the Middle East, His Majesty’s High Commissioner for Palestine and Transjordan, the Governor-General of India, General Headquarters India, General Head quarters, Middle East, Political Intelligence Centre, Middle East, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, the Political Agent at Koweit and to His Majesty’s Consular Officers at Basra and Mosul.

ON Thursday, the 4 th November, His Royal Highness the Regent of Iraq arrived in this country on a visit to Their Majesties The King and Queen. This visit was arranged for the 10th and 11 th November. For the remainder of his stay, lasting until the 2nd December, His Royal Highness and the members of his suite were the guests of His Majesty’s Government and, when in London, were accommodated at Claridge’s Hotel 2. Owing to the uncertainties of air travel it was arranged that His Royal Highness should reach England some days before the time of his visit to I heir Majesties; and, his departure from the Middle East being considerably earlier than had been anticipated, it appeared at one time likely that he might be expected on the 31st October last. He was, however, delayed for four days in Gibraltar, during which time he was entertained by the Acting Governor and, I understand, took the opportunity to make an unofficial excursion into Spain. The airport at which His Royal Highness should have landed in England was fogbound on the day of his arrival, but it fortunately proved possible to bring him to an airport only some 80 miles distant. He was conveyed thence by car to Lyneham, where he was met by the Iraqi Minister, Colonel Sir Eric Crankshaw, Secretary of the Government Hospitality Fund, and Mr. John Chaplin, representing myself, and greeted by the Lord Lieutenant and the Assistant Chief Constable of the county. On arrival at Paddington Station, His Royal Highness was met by His Royal Highness the Duke of Gloucester, on behalf of the King, and by representatives of His Majesty's Government and of the Foreign Office. 3 . The Regent’s Iraqi suite consisted of Lieutenant-General Ismail Namiq, Acting Chief of the Iraqi General Staff, and Lieutenant-Colonel tlbaid Abdullah A1 Mudhaifi, aide-de-camp. He was also accompanied by Dr. H. C. Sinderson, who had been granted the temporary rank of brigadier in the Iraqi army for the duration of the visit. Mr. Chaplin was attached to His Royal Highness throughout his stay; for the period of his visit to The King, Lieutenant-Colonel T. E° G. Nugent, Comptroller of the Lord Chamberlain’s Office, was also attached, and while His Royal Highness was the guest of His Majesty's Govern ment Colonel Crankshaw was in attendance ex officio. 4 His Royal Highness was fetched from Claridge’s Hotel to Buckingham Palace at 5-45 p.m. on Wednesday, the 10th November. The detailed programme of his visit, which, under war conditions, was shorn of all ceiemonial, is given in two memoranda issued by the Lord Chamberlain s Office, of which copies are enclosed.() On the day of his arri\al the Regent bestowed upon The Kin°' the Chain of the Hashnnite Order, which is restricted to heads of States, and had also been conferred upon His late Majesty King George V by the late King Faisal I of Iraq; His Royal Highness himself received from His Majesty the insignia of honorary Knight Grand ( ross of tne \ ictorian Older, including, in view 7 of his Royal status, the Collar of the Order. Otheiwise, no decorations w r ere conferred in connexion with the visit. The Emir Abdulillah also made personal gifts of Iraqi silver and silks to Theii Majesties and to Their Royal Highnesses the Princess Elizabeth and the Princess Margaret Rose, being given in return a pair of silver-gilt cups, by which he was much gratified. The visit ended at 10 a.m. on Friday, the 12th November, but before finally leaving the United Kingdom His Royal Highness called again to bid farewell to The King on the 1st December. 5. During the periods 4th-10th November and 12th November—2nd Decem ber the Regent, as the guest of His Majesty s Government, carried out an t 1 ) Not printed. Go-o . A-, 0 a a o. i ''R A- qoa I [49—47]extensive programme, of which a copy forms the third enclosure to this despatch.(') In accordance with your Excellency’s suggestion arrangements were made for him not only to visit naval, military and air establishments and factories producing war equipment, but also to gain some impression of current activities in Great Britain unconnected, or only indirectly connected, with the prosecution of war. In the former period His Royal Highness remained in London—apart from single-day excursions to inspect the coastal defences and naval establish ment at Dover and the College at Winchester. In London, he toured some of the worst bombed areas, and, on the reverse of the medal, was shown anti-* aircraft batteries and the organisation of passive air defence, including a demonstration of fire-fighting. He also visited the Royal Mint, the Bank of England and the British Broadcasting Corporation. 6 . On the 8 th November the Emir was entertained by His Majesty’s Government at a luncheon over which, in my absence, the Deputy Prime Minister presided. Copies of the speeches exchanged on this occasion are enclosed.(') 7 . For the greater part of his time, between the l^th and 26th November, His Royal Highness was outside London. After spending a week-end as the guest of Air Vice-Marshal Champion de Crespigny at Cranwell, where he inspected the Royal Air Force College and training establishments and spent an afternoon shooting, he left for a tour in the eastern counties. This com prised visits to a fighter station, to the University of Cambridge, to a bomber station and to Newmarket. Unhappily, on the night which he spent at the bomber station, operations, which it had hoped that he might witness, were impossible on account of bad weather. On the 17th November His Royal Highness was entertained to luncheon at the Mansion House by the Lord Mayor of London; no speeches were made. He left again for the Midlands on the 19th November to see the bomb damage at Coventry, an aircraft factory at Castle Bromwich, near Birmingham, and the General Electric Company’s works at Stafford, which are engaged inter alia on the production of tanks. At Castle Bromwich the Emir made a flight with a test pilot in a “ Lancaster ” bombing aircraft (which he did not entirely relish), and at Stafford was driven over the test course in a tank of the latest model. 8 . Returning to London on the 21st November the Regent left again the same evening for Scotland. On the following day in Glasgow he visited the docks and Messrs. John Brown and Company's shipyard, where a battleship and an aircraft-carrier were under construction, before being entertained to luncheon at the City Chambers by the Lord Provost; after luncheon he was shown over Messrs. William Beardmore and Company’s steelworks and then left for Edinburgh by car. During his stay in that city, dinners were given for His Royal Highness by the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Lord Provost and a luncheon by the British Council; a number of speeches were made at these functions, but in accordance with his earnest desire the Emir was not called upon to make a formal reply, and a few words of thanks uttered impromptu were all the more warmly received. 9. The Regent left Edinburgh for the Home Fleet on the 23rd November, proceeding by air from Donibristle after an inspection of the Fleet Air Arm station there and a most sumptuous luncheon. He and his suite were the guests of the Commander-in-chief, Admiral Sir Bruce Fraser, and spent the night on board the flagship. The weather was, unfortunately, wet and stormy, and deteriorating flying conditions necessitated some curtailment of the programme, but the Emir was able to go over not only the flagship but also a submarine, which had been brought alongside, and a destroyer depot-ship, where he was presented with souvenirs made during the brief time that he was on board. He had, further, the opportunity of seeing two recently completed destroyers, one of which conveyed him to, and the other from, the anchorage of the Home Fleet. 10 . In Edinburgh the Regent visited the principal places of interest and laid a wreath on the War Memorial Shrine at the Castle. He returned to London overnight, arriving on Friday, the 20th November. From then until his departure, the date of which could not be precisely determined until the last moment, his programme was restricted to social engagements, apart from a visit to the House of Commons on the 1 st December. His Royal Highness displayed considerable interest in the proceedings of Parliament and was fortunate in being able to attend a debate of some general significance on the release of Sir Oswald Mosley; he was also entertained to tea, unofficially, by a group of members interested in Arab affairs, and the Speaker was presented to him. f 1 ) Not printed.3 + H- It should also be recorded that on the 27th November the Regent was the guest of honour at a luncheon given by the President of Poland, prior to which M. Raczkiewicz, who had wished thereby to show his appreciation of the hospitality accorded to his countrymen in Iraq, bestowed upon His Royal Highness the First Class of the Order of Polonia Restituta; General Ismail Namiq received the Second Class and Dr. Sinderson and Colonel Ubaid Abdullah the Third Class of the same order. 12. On the 30th November Lord Portal, on behalf of His Majesty 's Govern- *^ient, entertained His Royal Highness at a small farewell dinner at which His Royal Highness the Duke of Gloucester was present. 13. For security reasons no ceremony was observed on the Regent s departure, and His Royal Highness left London incognito on the 2nd December. He embarked in a flying-boat at Poole harbour at noon on the same day and was seen off by M. Daud al Haidari, Colonel Crankshaw and Mr. Chaplin. 14. While in England His Royal Highness embarked upon no formal political discussions—nor had he, indeed, contemplated doing so—but the Prime Minister took the opportunity to speak to him informally and in general terms of Arab questions, and, at the Emir’s request, the conversation was resumed in Cairo. In addition, the views which His Royal Highness expressed in regard to the future of the Iraqi army and of the constitution of the British advisory military mission form the subject of correspondence ending with my telegram No. 773 of the 4th December. 15. The Regent, frank and friendly, yet dignified of bearing, created an excellent impression in this country. The programme which had been planned for him was inevitably an arduous one, if only from the physical point of view; yet His Royal Highness accepted it in toto and accomplished it cheerfully with out apparent signs of fatigue or loss of interest. The arrangements, which under the overriding control of the Government Hospitality Fund had in large part been made through the Ministry of Information (notably outside London), were highly satisfactory, and the Regent seemed genuinely to appreciate the efforts which were made to render his visit both instructive and entertaining. I understand that his tour is probably the most extensive which has been devised for a foreign visitor and I hope that, by reason both of the publicity which has been secured for it in the Middle East and of the impressions which His Royal Highness has carried away, it has, as I believe, served a useful purpose. The Regent himself, at all events, appeared to be deeply impressed by the welcome accorded to him by Their Majesties and to be suitably gratified not only by the programme arranged for him as the guest of His Majesty’s Government but also by the considerable measure of private hospitality which he enjoyed.

Cornwallis to Mr. Eden.—{Received 'litth November.) (No. 401.) Sir, Bagdad, l'2th November, 1943. SOON after my return to Bagdad on the 16th September a political crisis developed which nearly led to the fall of the Cabinet. On the 18th September the Prime Minister’s doctor informed me that his Excellency urgently needed rest as he was suft'ering from low blood-pressure combined with anaemia. 1 discussed with Nuri Pasha what, in the circumstances, he had best do. With my encourage ment he decided to go to Palestine for treatment until the opening of Parliament on the 9th October. He hoped that the choice of official candidates for the elections had been decided and that he could without difficulty absent himself for a fortnight from the country. He accordingly arranged to leave by British Air ways on the 26th September. On the 25th September his Excellency was, however, confronted with unexpected difficulties. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, who had for some time been restive, resigned because he was dissatisfied generally with the manner in which candidates for election were being chosen, and sharp disagree ments were found to exist among other Ministers concerning the claims of a number of individuals for inclusion in the official list. Nuri Pasha, deploying all his powers of cajolery, persuaded Nasrat al F’arisi to remain at his post until after Parliament had met and. by juggling skilfully with men and places, con trived to satisfy the more pressing election demands of his other colleagues. But these measures brought only a very fleeting detente, for when his Excellency went to the Palace with his final list of candidates, the Regent blandly produced an entirely new selection which he urged the Prime Minister to accept. Hurried discussions and consultations followed and some measure of agreement was reached. The Cabinet (except the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who at this stage abruptly made his resignation final) were willing to approve a large number of the Regent's nominees, but His Royal Highness made two conditions which they found it hard to accept. He stipulated that no sons or brothers of ministers or prominent officials, such as mutessarifs. should be nominated, and insisted on the inclusion of five shiahs belonging to a group which for some time had been political enemies of 8 a 1 ih Jabr as well as strong critics of the Cabinet. I p to the evening of the 27th September the difficulty had not been resolved and on the following morning His Royal Highness asked me to go to see him. 2 . I found him critical of his ministers and evidently resolved to sack the lot unless they accepted his list of candidates nem. con. His quaint plan was to make the Lord Mayor of Bagdad, Arshad al Umari, Prime Minister, with a team comprising Tashin Ali, 1 ahsin al Askari, Salman al Barraq and some others of even less consequence. The thoughtless and irresponsible way in which His Royal Highness had juggled these names together was revealed by his remarks that'he had found Tashin Ali too stupid as Rais of the Royal Diwan and would be Mad to get rid of him by makino- him Minister of Defence. His Royal Highness did not want to ask Ibrahim Kama! to form a Cabinet as it was not likely that he would accept the Palace list of candidates, whereas Arshad al Umari was prepared to swallow it whole. I advised the Regent that I thought it was unconstitutional for him to demand the acceptance of his list in toto and that it was unwise of him to precipitate an acute crisis because his ministers had shied at the names of the few shiahs for whose nomination he was pressin°- so stronglv If he wished to dismiss the Cabinet he should choose better ground^than this^on which to take a stand. T left His Royal Highness apparently in a good humour, but later in the day his mood darkened and in the afternoon he went off suddenlv to his countrv house at Salah-ud-Din (near Arbil), though his orioRm] r ] an to have remained in Bagdad until the following day. The Cabinet thereupon helda special meeting at which they agreed to accept ninety-one out of t le iegent &amp; 105 nominations, but raised objection to the remaining tourteeii. hurther negotiations conducted by courier during the three-day holiday or “ ie a H ^ti, which began on the 30th September, resulted in an oiler by the 1 rune Minister t‘&gt; accept eight more of His Royal Highness s list, not including the n\e shialis to whom he and his colleagues had taken exception. Salih Jabi and Jalai Habau-^^ refused, however, to agree to this solution and resigned. .Thereafter, a few further adjustments having been made, a list of candidates acceptable to both the Regent and the remaining members of the Cabinet w r as drawn up and the elections took place throughout the country on the 5th and 6 th October. I he results showed that some sixty-five of the members of the last Chamber had been returned, and that of the remainder thirty had been in one or more previous Parliaments and about twenty were new men. All of the vehement and convinced supporters of Rashid Ali s anti-British policy were eliminated. In its general character the new r Chamber is very much like most of its predecessors and it may be relied upon to act in much the same way as other Chambers have acted in the past. 3. At the official opening of Parliament on the 9th October the Speech from the Throne w r as short and merely intimated that the chief work of the session would be to consider the amendments to the Organic Law passed by the last Parliament and to prepare a new electoral law r which would harmonise with the spirit of these amendments. Muhammad al Sadr and Hamdi al Pachachi were re-elected respectively President of the Senate and President of the Chamber. 4. Parliament having got to w r ork the Prime Minister was at last able to snatch a bare fortnight’s rest. He left by air for Palestine on the 11 th October and returned on the 23rd October in time to supervise the constitutional arrange ments made necessary by the Regent's impending absence on a visit to the United Kingdom and to deal wdth the opposition that was threatened in the Senate to the Law Amending the Constitution. This measure passed through the Chamber without difficulty, but in the Senate an attempt seems to have been made to make it the occasion for criticism of the elections. This trouble was, however, soon disposed of by the Prime Minister, and the Senate passed the law at their third meeting. 5. Early in September the Bagdad radio and press suddenly opened an attacked on Zionism. Much of the matter used was historical and comment was on the wLole reasonable, but there were also articles which employed highly emotive language and contained unmistakable threats of retaliatory violence against Jews in other Arab countries if the Zionists persisted in their endeavours to make Palestine a Jewish State. Such an outburst could only have occurred under official direction, and in my absence Mr. Thompson immediately made strong representations to the Prime Minister emphasising its several objectionable features. 6 . iNuri Pasha took the line that the propaganda of the Zionist extremists had remained unanswered long enough; in America a strong anti-Arab campaign was in progress and he had therefore lifted the ban which in Iraq had for a long time been placed on all publicity about the Jewish problem in Palestine. He undertook, however, to insist on moderation and to consider calling off the cam paign after a few days. Some improvement was noticeable after this interview, but on the 17th September, the day after my return from leave, two more articles appeared, one of which stressed in strong language the point that the policy of the extreme Zionists would react adversely on Jews living in Arab countries other than Palestine. I accordingly raised the subject myself in the course of a long conversation that I had that day with the Prime Minister and told him frankly that provocative tactics of this kind would in the long run do much harm to the Arabs themselves. Thereafter the articles ceased. 7. This anti-Zionist outburst much alarmed the large local Jewish popula tion and many were apparently persuaded to believe that it had been encouraged by British influence. Among the Jews, and to a lesser extent among the Arabs, the idea was canvassed that the British were pro-Arab and the Americans pro- Jew, and care was taken by interested persons to see that suspicions that we were the real instigators of anti-Zionist feeling among the Arabs were brought to American notice. The American Legation were informed of the facts, but the arrival of Colonel Newcombe on the 13th September for a week’s intense contact- hip of A]ab .Nationalists was pomtGrl to fw many as a further evidence of Britishsympathy for Arab nationalism. On the other hand, the colonel s outspoken condemnation to a press meeting of noisy clamour about Palestine as damaging to Arab reputation in the United Kingdom and the United States seems to have had a good effect. 8 . The action taken by the French authorities on the 11 th November against jthe Lebanese Government after the Lebanese Parliament had amended the Consti- —'(tution deeply shocked public opinion in this country. It is too early yet to attempt to forecast what further reactions may result, but I fear that, unless the French find a more conciliatory method of dealing with the situation than that of keeping the members of the Lebanese Government under arrest, both the Iraqi Govern ment and the Iraqi people will feel obliged to express openly their indignation and resentment. Meanwhile, what has occurred illustrates with brutal clarity the truth that the situation in Arab countries can change out of all recognition in the short space of a few hours. 9. During September Mulla Mustafa, the Barzani chieftain who escaped from detention in Sulaimani in July, was joined by a Turkish outlaw named Said Birokhi and several Iraqi fugitive criminals and towards the end of the month he successfully raided a number of police posts in the Mergasur area to the north-west of Rowanduz. Police reinforcements were sent to deal with the situation, but in a fight with Mustafa’s forces in the hills about 30 miles north west of Rowanduz they lost five men killed and a number of rifles and light automatics and withdrew in some confusion. The tribesmen's next move was to threaten the Nahiyah headquarters at Shirwan Mazin. where there was a police garrison of about twenty men with their families. The police station was not well sited for defence, food supplies were short, and on the 23rd October the garrison surrendered. 10 . After this blow to the local prestige of the Government most of the small police posts in the Barzani area were evacuated and the Iraqi army took over the conduct of the operations against Mulla Mustafa. Orders were issued for the concentration of a force of about one mixed brigade in the disturbed area and the necessary movements had been finished by the end of October. In the meanwhile, Turkish forces had attacked Said Barokhi on the other side of the border, killing him and a number of his men. This event and the show of force by the Iraqi army apparently lowered Mulla Mustafa’s morale considerably, and he sent in a con ciliatory message to the officer commanding Iraqi troops. Further letters there upon passed between him and the Iraqi authorities, concluding in an offer of pardon by the Iraqi Government provided that Mulla Mustafa surrendered with out delay and gave up the arms taken from the police. Mulla Mustafa replied that he would accept if I gave an assurance that his life would be spared and the terms offered properly observed. After obtaining from the Prime Minister certain assurances which I considered necessary regarding the future treatment of the Barzani chiefs, I authorised the political adviser, Northern Area, to send a letter to Mulla Mustafa advising him to surrender on the terms offered to him. His reply, dated the 3rd November, was a categorical refusal to surrender to the Iraqi Government and further negotiation was evidently useless. 11 On the 6 th November Iraqi troops and police made a reconnaissance in force from Margasur north Avar ds in the direction of the Greater Zab River, the head of the British Military Mission and the Iraqi Deputy Chief of the General Staff being present with the troops. They soon met with spirited opposition and lost a number of men killed and wounded before abandoning the reconnaissance and returning to their base. Two days later a similar and equally ineffective operation was carried out and on the 10th November a convoy moving from Rowanduz to Mergasur was attacked by tribesmen and extricated with some difficulty from an uncomfortable situation. In these operations the Iraqi troops and police claim to have inflicted casualties on the tribesmen, but they them selves have shown a lamentable lack of training in mountain warfare. They have also lost three or four light automatics and many more rifles to the tribesmen. At the time of writing it seems doubtful whether there will be time before the onset of winter to attempt any further operations other than restricted patrolling. 12 . A new mutessarif. Wafiq Habib, has been appointed to Sulaimani and Shaikh Mahmud’s son. Baba Ali, has been allowed to return to his home. The internment order passed against Latif (Baba All’s younger brother) has also been cancelled and there is hope that he may be persuaded to return from Sardasht,4 where he has been adding to the confusion already existing among the Kurdish tribes on the Persian border. 13. 1 he ^tezidi chieftains, Khalaf al Nasir and Khodaida Kamo Sharo, were detained in Mosul in early September and later sent to live in Halabja, in the Sulaimani Liwa. Fhey had been giving trouble to the local authorities in ^ e .^ n j ar ’ ai id it was considered that a short spell of enforced residence outside their own tribal area would make them more amenable. 14. M. Maisky arrived in Bagdad by the overland route in the early oi the 6th October and left the following morning by car en route for 1 eh ran. During his short stay he had an interview with Nuri Pasha, who told m6 j t d 1 ? Ia / sky was obviousl y eager that diplomatic relations between Moscow and Bagdad should be established as soon as possible. He was, however, deter mined that the first official step towards this end should be taken by the Iraqi Government. Xuri Pasha agreed in principle to an exchange of diplomatic repiesentatives, but, pleading the Cabinet difficulties and his own imminent departure on leave under doctor’s orders, deferred further action to a later date. I 16 .} r \ l } ie GDmsIer explained to me that it was his intention to await the outcome ot the then forthcoming Moscow Conference and of the subsequent conference ' Tvr le W ° 11 d take P lace between Mr. Churchill, President Roosevelt and Marsnal otalm. 15. The establishment of a Russian Legation in Bagdad would without doubt excite much interest and speculation not only in the capital itself but throughout Iraq. Russian military successes have won as much popular admin,- t on here as they have elsewhere among the peoples of the United Nations and the social and industrial achievements of the Soviet Government, though only dimly understood have attracted wide attention. There is. moreover, hi'this country , an old established tradition of foreign interference, and among many of its people an inherited instinct for intrigue with foreign influences which will give to the advent of a Soviet diplomatic mission a special significance and importance It S to he expected that many of the young men of the “ left wing ” will hasten to establish personal contact with the members of the Soviet Mission and that tion a'tS 0n Th t e l h h i VT t erb l° le t they Wl11 P ° Ur OUt lh0 '' “‘h.-'siasm in adula- tion and flattery.

Sir, 12y Copy No. 1 ^ _ (Received ‘l?&gt;rd November.) ^ Bagdad, §th November, •_ 10/10 ATn r»i Pq all si _ .ir IT will be within your recollection that, when in October 1942 Nuri reformed the then most recent of his many Cabinets, the most important of the new appointments was the transfer of Saleh Jabr, who had shown hunse a courageous and determined Minister of the Interior during the dimcult days o the previous summer, to the Ministry of Finance, which at that time was responsible for all supply questions. It was confidently hoped that the new Minister would display as much decision and enterprise in his new post as m ms previous appointment, and it was anticipated that he would lose no time m applying the rigorous, and even drastic, measures which all thinking persons realised alone could cushion a backward and unprepared country against the impact of the economic difficulties which the war was increasingly bringing in its train In particular, it was fondly believed that the relatively young and progressive Saleh Jabr would willingly avail himself of expert outside assistance in the discharge of his onerous responsibilities, and we, indeed, envisaged the early recruitment of experienced British personnel who would be granted executive powers and, in effect, function in the Ministry of Finance as a Directorate-General of Supply, controlling imports, applying rationing schemes, directing the best use of home production, and the like Unhappily, these optimistic expectations were soon to prove groundless Saleh Jabr who had lately married a lady of strong personality but local outlook from Hillah displayed small enthusiasm towards the enlistment of foreign staff, and even failed to ma'e any adequate use of such officers as Major Page, who was already at work m his Ministry. All too quickly it became apparent that the new Minister of Finance harboured a variety of preconceived notions about the problems of the hour, and, furthermore that, while he was loud in his protestations about ruthless action against “ economic fifth columnists,” important vested interests anxious to profit from the rising tide of speculation and inflation would be enabled to do so with 2 As the remorseless wrecks passed and the world enteied upon the historic year 1943, the difficulties of the Minister of Finance increased, and m fairness it must be recorded that he sought to remedy some of his errors, though it gradually became more and more evident that the job was too big for him. ' least however, no one accused him of corruption. During the first quarter of the year a British officer. Colonel Le Blanc, was made Director-General of I ransport with executive powers, and his appointment has proved an outstanding success. Then, following the enactment of the new “Law for the Regulation of the Economic Life of the Country,” a variety of notifications aimed at hoarders and speculators and the better distribution of necessities were issued with Saleh Jabr’s support. They led to a temporary drop m prices, but prohteers soon recovered courage when nothing was done to enforce the new regulations. Here Saleh Jabr suffered through the Cabinet reshuffle in June which took him back t 0 Interior leaving the Ministry of Finance in the vicious hands of Jelal Baban, who, having previously loudly criticised the Government s enforcement policy which, had it been applied, would have affected his personal interests proceeded to sabotage everything that was being attempted. The few weeks Saleh Jabr spent in his new Ministry before proceeding on leave to 1 alestme m the lattei half of July were primarilv occupied by the last and most difficult stages ot the barley negotiations. That in the end we were able to secure a written contract for 200,000 tons was largely due to his co-operation. ^ . Qol , 3 If I have dwelt in some detail on the disappointment that was Saleh Jabr it is because, in the light of subsequent events, his early inability to rise to the occasion may be regarded as something of a turning-point m Iraq s war-time history. By his failure Saleh Jabr led the country down a twisting road that. - —f 48—81 4+# 'tyl 0.0 %2 has grown more and more difficult for the rattletrap administrative machine to negotiate, and it is now painfully clear, even to local politicians, that it has neither the power nor the gearing to continue much farther without an effective readjustment of its Cabinet load and without extraneous help in the persons of skilled mechanics. It is unfortunate that in the twelve months that have elapsed since October 1942 the supply of the latter has been sharply reduced by other demands, and Iraqi Ministers, who are now reconciled to the enlistment of British executives, find them hard to get. Such, in general terms, is the position to-day. Until the end of July, by which date we had completed the arduous and wearisome barley negotiations, the politico-economic health of the country had deteriorated steadily, but not too rapidly. The sweltering heat of midsummer ushered in, however, a period of slackness and confusion which has increased the downward pace. There have been squabbles in the Cabinet, and recently some snarling between the Regent and his Ministers. Nuri Pasha has been unwell and valuable time has been wasted during his two absences. The elections—'if. indeed, the selection of parliamentarians in this country can be so euphemistically described—were a further disturbing factor. And, finally, there was a good deal of pother over the arrangements for the Regent’s visit to the United Kingdom. For all these and some other reasons, I have found it hard since my return from leave in September to pin any member of the Government down to harsh realities. It was only when the Regent was safely on his way that on the 30th October I at last managed to corner the Prime Minister for an interview that, I believe, attained an all-time high in its duration, for we conversed together without a break for four hours and twenty minutes. 4. I did not mince words. By his persistent preoccupation over his dreams of “ haute politique,” by his dislike of detail, and by his perhaps natural reluctance to offend powerful agricultural and mercantile vested interests, as well as by his tendency 'to let thorny domestic questions slide in the hope that something may turn up to solve them without any special or unpopular effort on his part, Nuri Pasha cannot escape blame for the existing state of affairs. I attacked his Excellency for the endless failure of his Governments to tackle the economic problem honestly and boldly, for the manner in which they have tolerated dishonesty and inefficiency in the public services, for the resultant weakness and corruption in the police, the unreliability of the army, the mishandling of the Kurds, the shameless land-grabbing carried on by prominent personalities, the general lack of courageous leadership and the wide gulf between the Government and the people. I complained, too, of the harmful effects of widespread nepotism and about the low moral tone of public life. I emphasised that now was the time to improve the Administration and to carry out much- needed reforms and modernisation. And I expressed my fear that, if everything were allowed to drift on as at present, the eventual departure of the British forces would inevitably give rise to grave internal dangers. In this connexion I reminded the Prime Minister that there had been a radical change in the attitude of the people during the last twenty years. They were no longer as long-suffering as of yore. In the towns especially, education had brought about a new outlook, and I warned his Excellency that, unless account were taken of these facts, the old order might be very rudely disturbed at no very distant date. I urged that the time had come to act. He should have done with corrupt Ministers such as Jelal Baban. I could also, if pressed, name other politicians of like kidney. Steps to strengthen and cleanse the Administration should be put in hand without delay. 5. Nuri Pasha did not contest one of my statements. He confessed that the general deterioration in the politico-economic situation had been worrying him greatly. He was determined to do all in his power to halt the decline. To begin with, he would like to appoint a Deputy Prime Minister, and he had Ibrahim Kemal in mind as a candidate (the latter has since been sounded informally and has refused). He would act energetically to show speculators and profiteers that their field day was almost over, and. indeed, the Higher Supplies Committee had already taken certain decisions to that end. Moreover, I could rest assured that Colonel Bayliss—whose services have lately been secured from the Middle East Supply Centre and who will, I trust, in due course be appointed DUector-General, Imports—would receive full support in his work. As regards the civil service, a draft law was in preparation to set up special courts for dealing with officials accused of malpractices, while at the same time he contemplated improving salaries (especially those of the police) and other conditions of service for public servants paid less than I.D. 20 per month. (In the case of the police, he has already made good his word.) I suggested that the administration of theprovinces would improve if officials were subjected to constant inspection, and sounded his Excellency about his policy regarding the employment of British administrative inspectors. After some reflection, the Prime Minister observed that Iraq would be in need of this class of inspector for many years, and he thought that a few such officers—say, four—might be appointed in the near future. Nuri Pasha also expressed himself anxious to engage additional Bjatish ■Police officers, but he made difficulties, as he has done before, about their pay. and no conclusion was reached beyond an agreement to discuss the matter further at an early date. In spite of his words, I doubt whether he wishes to employ either administrative or police inspectors. But he expressed his eagerness to secure the services of a British agricultural expert, a forestry officer, a specialist in co-opera tive societies and a geologist. His Excellency warned me to expect early official requests for suitable candidates. 6. ^ ou will have gathered that our conversation ranged over a wide field. I believe the Prime Minister is sincere in his desire to achieve results. Apart from any other consideration, he is astute enough to be convinced, albeit belatedly, that the tide of. at any rate urban, discontent is rising and that he is personally much criticised. This realisation on the part of Nuri Pasha is illustrated by the disposition he has displayed, in other talks with me recently on how best to realign and complete the Cabinet, to consider the appointment of men other than old political hacks. He hopes to reconstitute his Cabinet within the next fortnight, and one can only hope that his outlook will not change. Action in the economic sphere need not be delayed by the Regent’s absence; and here I should like to add that Colonel Bayliss, while in no way underestimating the complexities of his task, told Mr. Thompson the other night that he was by no means pessimistic. Provided he continued to enjoy the goodwill and co-opera tion that the Acting Minister of Finance (Abdul Blah ^Hafidh) is at present extending to him, and assuming he secured the trained staff for whom he is at present negotiating with Persia-Iraq Force and the Middle East Supply Centre, he viewed the future with some confidence. This question of experienced staff is of paramount importance, and I have caused Colonel Bayliss to be assured that in this and other directions he may count on my fullest support. For the rest. I will continue to do all that I can to galvanise the Government into renewed initiative and endeavour. 7. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Minister of State Resident in the Middle East, the Governor-General of India, the Political Intelligence Centre, Middle East, and to His Majesty’s Consular Officers at Basra and Mosul.

WITH reference to my telegram No. 942 of the 6th Octob er, I have the honour to offer the following observations on the new chamber. 2. In approximate figures some sixty-five of the members of the last chamber have returned, thirty others%ave been in one or more previous parliaments an about twenty are new men. llost of the sixt)Aive Deputies who were m the last Parliament supported, under duress, Rashid ^®’s dismissal of the Regent, but all of the vehement and convinced adherents of liis anti-British policy have been eliminated. In its general character, the chafnber is very much like most oi its predecessors. It has no novel features and it may be relied upon to act m much the same wav as other chambers have acted in the past. 3. There are one or two men with dubious personal records, a murder or two for which they escaped conviction, or perhaps an abuse of their official position for personal ^ain, for which they have not been brought to book, but such men have always found places in every Iraqi Parliament, and their presence in the new chamber gives no particular cause for political anxiety. 4. At the official opening of Parliament on the 9th October, the Speech from the Throne was short, and merely intimated that the chief work of the session would be to consider the amendments to the Organic Law passed by the last Parliament, and to prepare a new electoral la\t‘ which would harmonise with the spirit of these amendments. ; * [46—78] r . y A /&lt;?.5.

Ylth September, 1943.^* r, A. I HAVE the honour to report that, though they have not been able to devise any miraculous remedies for many of the more serious economic ills that beset the country, the Iraqi Government have, during the period that has elapsed since I wrote my last general d espatch on the 26th July, succeeded in considerably ■\oy&gt; improving the collection and distribution of available supplies of locally manu- q f act u red goods and home-grown natural produce. Owing to transport and other dimcuities, gram collection tends to be slow in the north. On the whole, however, the grain needed for the big towns is being steadily collected, and the bread sold at fixed prices by the bakers who receive their flour from the authorities is. in most places, plentiful and of good quality, though it is usually sold at a price which still makes it expensive for the poorer classes. Basra has unhappily been an exception to the general rule. There muddle, lack of good flour mills and some • shortage of grain coupled no doubt with corruption 'and the dislike of local merchants for the Government policy of control has more than once made the bread supply the subject of complaint, in which the British Community Council joined. I urged the need for urgent relief measures on the Prime Minister and Minister for horeign Affairs, and it may be that these representations, which were received in good part, influenced to some degree the improvement that soon occurred. 2. The General Committee for the Distribution of Commodities in Kind has been able to show a creditable record of achievement. Up to the end of June the committee had distributed over 223 tons of locally manufactured and imported soap at a low price to Government officials and to many non-Government institu tions and factories. The director-general of local produce was, moreover able to show a profit of over I.D. 7.000 on the working of the Babylon Soap Factory during seven months under Government control. In addition over 122 000 metres of utility summer suiting and some 26,000 metres of winter suiting, both made in Iraq, have been distributed at low prices to junior officials throughout the country. Rice and edible oil have also been distributed. 3. Barley has been coming in from the farms to the United Kingdom Com mercial Corporation as fast as the latter can handle it, and deliveries are likely to be maintained at this rate until the whole purchase of 200,000 tons has been disposed of. As a result of pressure from cultivators anxious to sell more than tne one-third of the barley crop taken over by the Government, the latter announced on the 19th August that the remainder of the crop would be freed subject to licensed trading. No wholesale licences have, however, yet been issued and purchases have been restricted to those made by the United Kingdom Com mereia! Corporation’s agents, except for retail sales in small quantities. The problem has now arisen of persuading the Government not to issue any wholesale barley licences except to the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation’s ao-ents m order that purchases by the corporation considerably in excess of 200,00(f tons may be facilitated, the additional quantity being required to meet the inevitable emergency demand, this time from India, that experience has always shown is to be anticipated. In the circumstances it is perhaps unfortunate that the sugges tion that we should contract for an extra 100,000 tons put forward in mv telegram N o. 655 of the 14th July was not accepted. _in_my__ - 4 Efforts made by local authorities to control ’the prices of fruit and vegetables have not been altogether successful. In most of the provinces adeoimte supplies seem to be available at the fixed prices, though these are naturally much above the pre-war level, but in Bagdad the position is less favourable. The Lord Mayor has made a gallant and well-planned attempt to keep prices down, but the retail traders have been persistently obstructive and the public too ready to trade . [46 14] s&amp;S**. ' &lt;/ . &amp; Sry ^ ArrTfc/ B2 ~ a] ei in a new black market. Tomatoes, the most popular and essential vegetable m local cooking, were priced at 40 fils a kilogramme at the beginning of August and at once disappeared from the market, and at the end of the month, with the hx^d price up to 64 fils a kilogramme, good quality tomatoes were hard to find m the open bazaar. The pre-war price was about 6 fils a kilogramme for the best quality. The price of meat has continued steadily to rise, and in Bagdad now, at 260 fils (something Over 5s.) a kilogramme, it is far beyond the reach of the poor. 5. Imported manufactured articles are becoming more and more expensive, ' and the elaborate plans developed under the Law for the Regulation of the Economic Life of the Country, enacted in April last, have not yet enabled any effective control of prices to be established. The poor townspeople therefore are likely to suffer grievously this winter for want of warm clothing although supplies &lt;-1 v&gt;/~k -Pn-i-nl-tr tO r\-r\ f i -pn I T’Virt -p o i rwr 1 O P 1 /~*T 1 rm of Vl AT' Vt n T1 r] il T’P on the /• are fairly plentiful. The farming population, on the other hand, are, whole, very well off. They are obtaining record prices for their produce, have plenty of food for themselves and with their tribal and village handicrafts are much better able to dispense with imported clothing than the townspeople. Nevertheless, in many of the hill valleys in the northern and north-eastern frontier districts, where little grain is grown and there has been a succession of bad harvests, many of the villages are in a sorry plight, and I have of late repeatedly urged both the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs to make it their business to see that the mutessarifs concerned supply these villages in time with food for the winter and seed to sow for next year’s harvest. 6. Iraq’s difficulties in regard to the import of cotton piece-goods from India remain unsolved. Proposals and counter-proposals have now been exchanged over a long period, and on the Iraqi side some renewed irritation is now becoming evident. This is not the place in which to discuss details, but a general view of the current economic situation would be incomplete without allusion to the disappointment and serious practical difficulties to which failure to find a solution to this problem is now giving rise. As I have urged ad nauseam, loss of Iraqi goodwill over this question may well react against our efforts to relieve India’s grain crisis. 7. The surrender of Italy was welcomed in all parts of the country, and the other good news received from all the battle fronts has maintained at a high level public confidence in ail Allied victory. Internal security remains satisfactory and enemy propaganda insignificant. The released internees have so far given no trouble and the obnoxious Zakji Kadhom has been sent back to the concentration I camp at Amara. 8. The secondary elections have now been completed in most constituencies and the election of Deputies will probably take place about the end of the month. The Prime Minister’s idea seems to be to adopt again as Government candidates most of the Deputies in the last Parliament, but to exclude those who were closely associated with Rashid Ali in 1941. I have lately impressed on him (and also upon the Regent) the need for new blood in the Chamber, but his Excellency is obstinately loyal to his old friends and distrustful of change 9. Thanks to the regular messages put out by the Arab News Agency, the Iraqi newspapers were able to give daily accounts of the Prime Minister’s move ments when he was visiting in late July and early August Damascus, Beirut. Jerusalem. Amman and Cairo for talks on Arab unity with Arab political leaders. The most important of his conversations were with Nahas Pasha. It is not quite clear what conclusions the two Prime Ministers reached, but it seems that it was left to Nahas Pasha to continue to exchange views with the interested parties and then, later on, to call a conference which would endeavour to work out a practical plan of federation based on the highest common factor of agreement existing between them. 10. The Office for Cultural Co-operation between Egypt and Iraq, estab lished by decree of the Egyptian Ministry of Education in July 1942. held a meeting in Alexandria in early August, which was attended by two officials of the Iraqi Ministry of Education. According to statements which have been made tq the press, the meeting resulted in the drafting of a treaty of cultural co-operation to be concluded between Egypt and Iraq, the acceptance by the Egyptian authorities of the Iraqi Secondary School Certificate as qualifying Iraqi students for admission into Egyptian universities without further entrance examination, and the conclusion of arrangements for the loan to Iraq of a number of Egyptian professors and teachers. The Arab news agency announced on the 8th September that in future French would be taught in Iraqi schools, in order to bring their programme into line with that of the Egyptian schools.3 11. I he Bagdad newspapers continue to publish articles on Arab unity, and one editor has persuaded a number of people, whose interest in the subject is well known, to contribute a symposium of their views. These articles have been moderate in tone and have contained nothing new. A press and radio campaign against Zionism was started a few days ago, evidently under official guidance. ^ I have drawn Nuri Pasha’s attention to the undesirability of unduly exciting the ^ ^^ublic mind at the present juncture, and was informed that this propaganda had jeen resorted to on the advice of the Iraqi Minister in Washington, who had lately reported a strong anti-Arab campaign in the United States. 12. I he I urkish Government appear to be taking interest in the plans which Arab nationalist leaders are now trying to formulate. Soon after Nuri Pasha s return to Bagdad from Cairo, the Turkish Minister called on the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and asked whether any information could be given to his Government about the aim and scope of the Prime Minister’s conversations with Nahas Pasha. He was, I understand, given an outline of the Prime Minister s general ideas on the manner in which the Arab countries could be brought closer together, and a few days later the Prime Minister let me know that he was hoping to arrange for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to go to Turkey to inform his 1 urkish colleague of the action which had already been taken to further Arab unity, and to explain that the ultimate hope was that any federation of the Arab States brought into being should form part of a larger group of Middle Eastern States formed on the lines suggested by Mr. Churchill in his broadcast speech on the 21st March. This idea bears a close family resemblance to an inspiration that came to the Prime Minister a year or two ago for creating a Middle East bloc of countries allied with Great Britain, though its purpose is probably different. His earlier aim was to strengthen Iraq’s position vis-a-vis the Axis by means of regional defence pacts with the other countries which were also in special treaty relationship with Great Britain; now, his immediate purpose is more likely to be to dispel the misgivings that the Turkish Government have shown in the past and probably still entertain, at the prospect of a united Arab State stretching along the whole of their southern frontier. Up to the time of writing this despatch the Minister for Foreign Affairs has not, however, fallen in with the Prime Minister’s proposals, and it now seems unlikely that he will go to Turkey on this mission. 13. On his return home from Egypt on the 10th August, the Prime Minister found trouble waiting for him in the Cabinet. Nasrat-al-Farisi, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, was upset that such important conversations, touching Iraq’s external relations, should have been carried on without his having been consulted or even kept informed. He had expressed his displeasure on this point to several friends, and the local Tapers and Tadpoles, having heard the story, seized their opportunity and for a few days Bagdad buzzed with stories of Cabinet resigna tions and appointments. Nuri Pasha was, however, able after a long week-end with the Regent to appease the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and to persuade him to defer all idea of resigning until after the assembly of the new Parliament in October. 14. In August the Ministry of Education published their plans for this year’s award of scholarships for higher education outside Iraq. In all sixtv- three scholarships are to be given for colleges in Egypt or for the American University in Beirut. A wide range of subjects is covered, from Islamic art to veterinary surgery (a knowledge of which is, incidentally, greatly needed in this country where draught animals lead the life of the damned) and^mechanical and electrical engineering. The British Council’s representative in Iraq hopes to be able to arrange for all Iraqi students, including Government scholars at the American University, Beirut, to be accommodated in a special hostel under the supervision of British tutors. This is an excellent plan and may do somethino- to correct the fiery nationalist spirit, so often akin to Anglophobia, which seems to pervade the university as a whole. 15. Two incidents which occurred in Sulaimani are worth recording. The first was the absconding of Mulla Mustafa, brother of Shaikh Ahmad of Barzan. Mulla Mustafa had been banished to Sulaimani after the conclusion of the Barzan operations in 1931, and evading police control he fled back to his native mountains on the 13th July. He is now reported to have crossed the border to Turkey. Plans are being considered by the authorities to persuade him to return and to settle down peacefully. The second incident was an outbreak of anti-Government pamphleteering in Sulaimani town. The mutessarif suspected that two of the sons of Shaikh Mahmud, Baba Ali and Latif, were behind this nuisance and 46—14] , B 94 decided to send them and one or two others to Amara. The police succeeded in arresting Baba Ali, but Latif evaded them by a short head and fled across the | border into Persia. This was unfortunate because Baba Ali (a graduate of Columbia University in New York) though disgruntled and ill-disposed towards the Arab Government, is far less likely to cause trouble than his brother Latif, who has been brought up in Sulaimani and has inherited most of the picturesque characteristics of his turbulent father. Baba Ali and his kinsman Jalal, wb^v was arrested at the same time, have been sent to live at Ramadi, and the mutessarif is negotiating with Shaikh Mahmoud terms for the return of Latif. Developments are awaited. 16. The Prime Minister is still itching to send Iraqi troops to Syria. He failed last February to persuade His Majesty’s Government to accept the offer of a brigade and now, having heard privately that the Commander-in-chief. Middle Last, might be willing to use a contingent of Iraqi troops somehow and some where, his fertile imagination is once again busy devising new schemes. I think the Prime Minister would himself like to see Iraqi troops winning glory fighting side by side with their British Allies, but he knows that active service outside Iraq in the Allied cause would be unpopular with the Iraqi army. He is obliged, therefore, to stipulate that they shall only be used in an area which is near to home, and where there is little danger of coming under fire. There are obviously serious political objections to the use of Iraqi troops in Persia or Palestine, so Syria is left as the only territory to which it is possible to offer to send them. Service in Syria could moreover be represented in Iraq as a contribution, not so much to the cause of the Allies as to the cause of Arab unity and thus be the more easily justified. 17. The Prime Minister is also eagerly toying with the idea of building a broad guage railway from Bagdad to Homs'! This would connect Iraq with the Mediterranean at Tripoli and would be easier and less costly than to build a line to Haifa, Nuri Pasha no doubt also realises that such a line would be a practical and effective means.of strengthening the ties between Iraq and Syria. He has already been discussing with the Director-General of Railways a plan to make a start by building the first section as far as Ramadi. 18. The results of the Syrian elections have been well received in Iraq. The new President, Shukri Quwatli, is well known and popular, and it is felt that, in view of the assurances already given by His Majesty’s Government, Svria now has a chance of quickly achieving a position of independence and security similar to that enjoyed by Iraq. The Regent telegraphed his personal congratu lations to the President on his election, and many of his subjects did the same. 19. The Iraqi Government formally recognised the Syrian Government on the 3rd September. The Prime Minister tells me that it is proposed, in due course, to raise the status of the Iraqi Consulate-General at Damascus to that of a legation and to make the consul-general at Beirut charge d’affaires pending the eventual appointment of a minister. The Arab News Agency announced that the Syrian Government will reciprocate by opening a legation in Bagdad. I 20. The trouble with Saudi Arabia, to which I referred In my despatch No. 271, has died away, and the sleeping dogs of jealousy and suspicion raised by the outbreak of disaffection m Hail have once again been allowed to lapse into ! slumber. The new Persian minister, Muhsin Rais, presented his credentials on the 28th July, and seems to be pleasant and well intentioned. Iraq’s relations with Turkey remain normal, but the opening of diplomatic relations with Syria to which I have already referred, may lead to interesting developments. 21. An opportunity does not often occur in these omnibus despatches of referring to the work of the Ministry of Information in this country, but I think it is well to recall that this continues to be carried on with efficiency and enter prise by the Public Relations Department of this embassy, under the guidance and advice of the head of the mission. The public relations officers have established a sound position for themselves and some of their major conceptions, such as the travelling cinemas on car and launch, and the village reading-rooms, are winning a place among the established institutions of the country. The affiliated organisation, the Brothei hood of Freedom, ]s also beginning to exercise a con siderable influence, through its 650 committees and 7,000 members. Under the auspices of the public relation officers and the brotherhood, a number of tnbaJ sheikhs and other people of substance have recently been entertaining parties of fifty to a hundred British soldiers at their homes and other convenient centres to meet the local people, and these parties have done much to extend and develop good fellowship between the troops and the people of the country. It is5 gratifying that the discipline and general behaviour of British and Indian troops in this country have been remarkably good and but relatively few incidents have occurred. Considering the harsh climatic conditions, the lack of amenities and amusements, and the appalling boredom of the average soldier’s existence in this non-operational command, this is a real tribute to the men. Not long ago Nuri Pasha commented to me with obvious satisfaction on this happy t 0 f affairs. 22.

THOMPSON\. 1 o Copy No. hv* w \.w^l VMi August.) ^ ^ ^ ^ Bagdad, ‘Iftth July, 1943. Ui4Arigq C \ the 5th June an acute restiveness became noticeable among the leading members of the Iraqi Cabinet. The Prime Minister, with good reason, was disappointed with Saleh Jabr for his failure to fulfil the hopes placed in him when he went ^ ^ /j to the Ministry of Finance last October; Saleh Jabr was irritated with the Prime Minister for having obstructed a grant of several thousand acres of O'). 0. Government land which he wished to make to an old friend, he had quarrelled with the Minister of Justice and had fallen out with the Minister of Education, who was becoming increasingly disliked by all his colleagues because of nis coarseness; and Tahsin-al-Askari had proved a failure at the Ministry of the ( Interior. In addition, the Prime Minister suspected Daud-al-Haidari of intriguing against him and had reason to believe that in the absence of a proper Head of the Royal Diwan, minor Court officials were abusing their position to ^ P ^ influence tribal visitors to the Palace against the Government. CT.O. 2. In these confused but typical circumstances, some changes w^ere essential, and so soon as the current session of Parliament ended, Nun Pasha set about ^ / reorganising his Cabinet. His method was that which is usually employed at such times in this country; much hard talking behind the scenes wdth colleagues and with candidates for office, combined with many consultations with the Regent. His Excellency also came to see the ambassador frequently to exchange views. As a result, the following changes w^ere made on the 23rd June. Saleh Jabr was transferred to Interior and was succeeded at Finance by Jalal Baban. Tahsin Ali was appointed to the Palace as Head of the Royal Diwan and replaced at Education by Abdul Illah Hafidh, who, in turn, was succeeded at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs by Nasrat-al-Farisi. Daud-al-Haidari was dropped and consoled with the appointment of Minister, Grade I, in the Foreign Service en disponibilite (with full pay) and was succeeded by Ahmad Mukhtar Baban, in wffiose stead Tahsin-al-Askari went to Communications and Works. 3. The make-up of the re-formed Cabinet was. therefore, as follows : — and were regarded as routine changes, having no considerable influence in the policy of the Government. 4. The 1942-43 session of Parliament was further extended for ten days from the 1st June to enable the final readings of the draft legislation Amending the Organic Law to be taken in both Houses. This having been done, the session was closed and Parliament dissolved on the 9th June. Under the existing Organic Law new elections will now have to be held and Parliament summoned in 'special session before the 10th October. The text of the amending law has not yet been published,, so I cannot offer detailed comments. 5. In his last despatch Sir Kinahan Cornw T allis forecast that, with a view to authorising more releases, the Prime Minister would, before long, reconstitute the committee formed last winter to examine the records of interned persons In the event this was done about the middle of June and the Prime Minister promised the ambassador an opportunity to scrutinise the committee’s recom mendations before they were adopted.

Meanwhile, the Prime Minister, after a brief bout of pneumonia, effectively dealt with by ‘ B. and M. 693, had left for Syria. I was accordingly somewhat taken aback, on arriving at the American Legation for dinner on the 3rd July, to be told by Mr. Edmonds that an hour earlier the Minister of the Interior had, without referring to the committees issued orders for the release of fifty-seven internees. As Saleh Jabr was a fello\v~ guest, I lost no time in tackling him. To do his Excellency justice, I do not think that the Prime Minister had told him of the understanding which had been reached with the ambassador and, in view of the Prime Minister's illness, he had not been able to consult him. I expressed my concern at the precipitate manner in which he had ordered these releases and invited him to explain the reasons for his action. He said that, in the first place, he had himself been primarily responsible for the adoption of a strong internment policy, and in the second, that he was quite satisfied that none of the men released was at all likely to be dangerous. This second contention was largely borne out by examination of the list of those set free. Of the total of fifty-seven, thirty were found to be men of small account and twenty-two others had been provisionally classified by the committee as fit for release. Of the remaining five, however, 1 three were undesirables, with German wives, and one, a thoroughly bad man named Zaki Kadhim, an ex-non-commissioned officer of the Iraqi army who, as physical training instructor in the Teachers' Training College, had, m May 1941, earned notoriety as the organiser and leader of the so-called “ Death Squad ” of students pledged to fight to the end against the British. At my request, the Minister of the Interior arranged for the men with the German wives to be warned to be careful of their conduct and ordered Zaki Kadhim to live in the provinces under close police supervision. All these people had been sent to internment from Bagdad. The releases of internees from the provinces were dealt with more regularly. The Minister of the Interior was guided by the recommendations made by the mutessarifs and, through the adviser to the Ministry of the Interior, I was able to see the list of names before any releases were ordered. Of the original fifty-four names the Minister was persuaded to delete nine, and of the forty-five who remained only one was of any consequence. This was a troublesome intriguing sheikh of the Fatlah tribe of Diwaniyah. He had been living under restraint in Mandali and is now to be allowed to come to Baqubah. Twenty-three of the forty-five were released on the 18th July and the others are expected to be set free before the end of the month. Notwithstanding the improvement in Saleh Jabr’s tactics in dealing with this second batch, I subsequently spoke very seriously to the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the need for co-operation and prior consultation in all matters of internal security. 6. On the night of the 16th-17th June a large four-engined aircraft flew over Mosul. The next day several parachutes were discovered some miles to the west of the town, and it was clear that men had been dropped with a considerable equipment for organising political disturbances, espionage and sabotage. Three German officers and one Iraqi student were eventually captured in Kurdish dress near Arbil on the 29th June. The examination of these men has not yet been finished, but from the data so far collected it seems that they intended to drop not to the west of Mosul but much further east, close to the Persian frontier, and that they expected to find confederates ready to help them when they landed. An unpleasant feature of this business is that about a week passed before these agents were apprehended. During that period they undoubtedly received help, including gifts of clothing and food from friendly villagers, and possibly other helpers. A further fact that has caused no small comment is that the flight of the 16th-17th June was followed on succeeding nights by others, the enemy aircraft droning around at will on each occasion for some time over an extensive area. So far as I am aware, not even a rifle shot was directed at these hostile machines, and this has not helped our local prestige. 7. Nuri Pasha had intended to take leave soon after the middle of June and to pay his long-talked-of visit to Egypt to discuss plans for Arab unity with Nahas Pasha. The sudden illness to which I have already referred prevented him from carrying out this plan and obliged him to go to the Lebanon for his ; convalescence. He left Bagdad on the 6th July. His health being now apparently ; restored, he has gone down into Egypt to fulfil his original intention, but it is not clear what proposals he will make to Nahas Pasha, At the beginning of the year he had hopes of persuading the Egyptian Prime Minister to call together a congress of Arab leaders to draw up a plan for some kind of federation of the3 Arab States, but it was later reported from Jedda that last April he told the Saudi Arabian Minister that, in his opinion, an Arab Congress could not usefully be held until Syria and Palestine had been set free. It seems, therefore, that he may not yet have made up his mind whether Palestine and Syria must have their independence before anything can be done to bring the Arab countries closer together, or whether it is possible to work out a scheme for federation which would Bike in these countries as they are. 8. After long negotiations and much argument, the Iraqi Government offered at the end of June to fix the price of barley containing 10 per cent, dirt at I.D. 20/500 per ton delivered at collecting centres, produce tax paid. This offer, which represented a reduction of I.D. 4/500, or 18 per cent., on the price paid under the Iraqi Government’s fixed price scheme for the balance of the 1942 crop, was accepted by His Majesty’s Government. Owing to the Iraqi Government’s natural and characteristic reluctance to commit themselves on paper to supply a definite quantity and a last-minute change of ground regarding the method of payment for barley delivered to the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation, it was not until the 23rd July that notes were finally exchanged confirming the conditions on which the Iraqi Government undertook to ensure delivery of 200,000 tons of barley at the agreed price to the corporation. Most people think that the price of I.D. 20/500 is good enough to induce growers to sell their barley without aversion; in fact, there are signs that many of them are anxious to offer all the barley they have and not only the third at present requisitioned. The price of barley on the farms has been fixed at I.D. 15/000. The wheat price has also been fixed—at I.D. 25/000 on the farms for best quality, this being the same price as last year, and at I.D. 32/000 delivered at collecting centres, tax paid. 9. The Istihlak (consumption) tax on all natural produce was raised by 1^ per cent, and “ super ” tax increased substantially in laws passed just before Parliament was dissolved on the 9th June. 10. Many classes of imported goods became much cheaper after the publica tion in May of the new Law for the Regulation of the Economic Life of the Country and the subsequent issue of decrees canalising and controlling—on paper—trade in imported goods. As, however, the Government showed a lack of determination in setting up machinery for enforcing the decrees, the phase of lower prices soon passed and prices for imported goods are now, with few exceptions, almost back again at their old high level. Meat, fruit and vegetables are now dearer than ever and a large proportion of the working classes cannot afford to buy them. Many townspeople are therefore obliged to do without these very important foods. Farmers, on the other hand, are doing well and are better off than they have ever been, despite the rise in cost of the goods they themselves have to buy. 11. Prosecutions for infringements of the regulations for the control of trading made in May and June have been numerous and the sentences awarded salutary, but it will be no surprise to you, Sir, to know that there is reason to believe 'that some of the better connected and richer delinquents have not been brought before the courts. 12. Improvement in the direction of public education continues to be noticeable, but a successor to Professor Hamley is still an urgent need. The new Minister, Saiyid Abdul Illah Hafidh, is energetic and broad-minded. He evidently intends to try and keep politics out of the schools, and even welcomes British help. He is well disposed to British educational methods and knows how much needs to be done to reform education in this country. 13. At the end of May disturbances occurred in Hail, in Northern Saudi Arabia. King Abdul Azziz-al-Saud was persuaded that Hashimite intrigues were at the bottom of them, and he caused strongly worded representations to be made to His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Jedda. Nothing could be found here to confirm these'suspicions, but Ibn Saud unhappily considered that Iraq's rulers were the cause of all his troubles, and in early July he returned to the charge with a long message sent to His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires through Sheikh Yusuf Yasin. Unable to produce any evidence to substantiate his charges about Iraqi intrigues in Hail, he reverted to his old grievances and hashed them up with hotly spiced reiteration of his conviction that the Hashimites were trying to encircle and destroy him. Among the few tangible complaints included in this surprising tirade was his claim that the Iraqi Government were con scripting Saudi subjects into the Iraqi army and forcing them to take up Iraqi nationality. The trouble seems to come from the fact that in Zubair there aie many people of Najdi origin. The Iraqi authorities claim that Najdis are4 ex-Ottomans, and therefore became Iraqis under the nationality clauses of the Treaty of Lausanne; but the Saudi Government maintain that Najdis were never Ottoman subjects, and therefore did not become Iraqis but Saudi Arabians, i he point is debatable and King Abdul Azziz can no doubt produce arguments in support of his Government’s thesis, but there is no justification for assuming that the Iraqi attitude is part of a carefully developed plot to destroy his position and prestige. I have asked the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs to go into th and other outstanding questions with a view r to finding a means of improving relations with Ibn Saud, but in his present frame of mind His Majesty is, I fear, unlikely to be appeased by any reasonable adjustment that may he proposed. He is concerned with bigger problems. As 1 see the situation, he can read the writing at on the wall as well as most men. and what disturbs him is not frontier incidents or a dispute about the nationality of a few hundred men, but the vision of Arab n- unity which looms before him as he looks into the future. He can foresee that any federation of the Arab States must menace his own theocratic and antiquated regime. If he joins the federation, a primitive and backward State like Saudi Arabia can hope for nothing better than a very minor role; if he remains aloof, his fate will be no better. His good faith will be impugned and his kingdom will be doomed to eclipse and obscurity. The dilemma for him is real enough, but he is unlikely to resolve it by his present methods. 14. News of the death of General Sikorsky was received with much regret in Bagdad. Only a few days before the accident in which he was killed he had been in Iraq as the guest of the Government, and among other functions had taken part in the official celebrations of United Nations Day on the 14th June. His dignity and sincerity made a favourable impression on those whom he met and much sympathy was felt and expressed with the Polish people for their grievous loss in his death. The Regent telegraphed condolences to President Raczkiewicz, and the Iraqi Government and army were represented at the requiem mass which was said at the Latin Cathedral in Bagdad. 15. The ambassador left Bagdad for two months’ leave on the 29th June. The Prime Minister, as I have already related, went to the Lebanon a few days later and the Minister of the Interior left for a six weeks' holiday on the 24th July. Other members of the Government are, I hear, also planning to fade away quite soon. The barley contract having been concluded, there is no important political question which at the time of writing needs urgent attention. The problem of the hoped-for railway agreement is unlikely to receive any real attention at Iraqi hands until the Prime Minister is back in the saddle,‘a fact which, it must be confessed, causes no small irritation in military circles, from which emanate from tune to time murmured suggestions for “ firm action.” But, as I never lose an opportunity of explaining, Anglo-Iraqi relations are a delicate growth. Even if it were desirable, there are no sanctions we could emnlov tn spmrp nnint- I have, &amp;c. G. H.

I HAVE the honour to continue in this despatch the story of current events .in Iraq from the point at which it was concluded in my despatch No. Ill oi the 28th March. j r 2. Measures for the proper utilisation of the new harvest and tor the * further control of the sale of imported goods have, during the last two months STt occupied much of the Government’s attention and I myself have spent many hours discussing these measures with the Prime Minister, the Minister of Finance and the British Advisers concerned. The new “ Law for the Regulation of^ the Economic Life of the Country ” surprisingly passed through Parliament without damaging amendment—but not without severe censure of the Government s inability to cope with economic problems—and came into force on 13th April. It brought into being a Cabinet Committee of Supplies under the chairmanship of the Prime Minister^ and throughout the latter half of April this committee worked hard to discharge its onerous duties of 1 ‘ preventing hoarding and specula tion and of making available to the people supplies of the necessities of life The result of the committee's labours was a series of notifications put out m the first half of May by means of which a carefully thought out attempt is being made to check soaring prices and to ensure not only adequate supplies at low prices for internal needs but also to put the surplus of the year’s wheat and barley crops at the disposal of the United Kingdom Commercial Corppration for export to the neighbouring countries. 3. Put briefly the plan for these two cereals is that all growers are to surrender to the Government one half of their wheat crop and one third of their barley crop at a fixed price. The balance of the wheat crop may either be kept by owners or sold to the Government at the same price as the wheat compulsorily surrendered. The manner in which owners shall dispose of tne balance of their barley crop has not yet been determined, nor have prices yet been announced tor either wheat or barley, although the High Supply Committee have decided that the farm price of wheat is to remain unchanged at I.D. 2o per ton. A surplus of well over 200,000 tons of barley is expected and, as you know, I am negotiating a price at which this surplus can be purchased by the I nited Kingdom Commercial Corporation. At the time of writing this despatch it seems that the lowest figure to which the Iraqi Government are likely to agree is I.D. 22/500 a ton (including tax and transport to the nearest rail or river collecting centre). This is a hio-h price for the growers, even if judged on the basis of the current hhdi cost of living, but it is probably not higher than that which could be obtained in^the open market, once it became known that the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation intended to purchase large quantities. Iraq, it must be remembered, wishes to get all she can out of the war and the essence of the new doctrine of inter-Allied economy generally called lease-lend, is not even dimly understoocL The steps taken to lay hands on the surplus of the 1942 crop of barley, which I described in my last despatch, resulted in the transfer to the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation of nearly 29,000 tons of barley. A further considerable quantity is available in tax centres and it is expected that a substantial proportion of this will be released for the corporation, who will then have all they need before the new crop comes on the market. Control of 1942 barley was removed on the 20th May and all transactions were declared free until the threshing of the 1943 crop. Transactions in old wheat were also freed from all restrictions except that the price remains fixed as before. \ The preliminary measures taken for the cheaper sale and better distribu tion of imported goods aim at providing the Government with comprehensive information about all wholesale and retail traders and their stocks. When this information has been collected and collated further action to fix prices will follow. \11 dealers are to register stocks and, in future buying and selling whether in bulk or in detail will be restricted to licensed persons. The immediate effect of these [44-32] • b 1 o o U'V lusV 09. O. '?.A. o.o. LNd,measures has been to curtail wholesale dealings, to frighten speculators and to bring down by 15 to 25 per cent, the retail prices of a number of popular consumers goods such as yashmaks, cheap cotton piece-goods, razor blades and soap. Some wholesale prices dropped by as much as 30 to 40 per cent. The market is, however, waiting to see whether the new measures will be forcefully implemented and generally expects prices to recover again in view of past experience of the Govern^ ment’s inability to undertake sustained and effective action to control them. 5. Further control has also been established over the available means of motor transport. It is now absolutely forbidden to sell or purchase a motor vehicle or any kind of bicycle or accessories, whether new or second-hand, without the consent of the Director-General of Transport. Control has also been established over all agricultural machinery and irrigation pumps, but in this case it is largely a paper control as proper administrative authority for its application still remains to be set up. The United Kingdom Commercial Corporation have supplied the Directorate-General of Transport with some two thousand tyres of different sizes for sale to authorised purchasers. They are being distributed at fixed prices under the personal supervision of Colonel Le Blanc. 6. The Iraqi Government continue to press me hard for help to meet their own economic needs and tend to undervalue the blessings which, thanks to the good offices of His Majesty’s Government, they already enjoy. Their most urgent demand is for cotton piece-goods. The problem of how to supply the quantity needed at reasonable prices is still unsolved, but I am not without hope that Sir Arthur Rucker and Mr. Lloyd may find a solution during their current visit to India. Meanwhile the Iraqi Government have still to prepare a workable scheme for distributing cotton piece-goods at controlled prices to consumers. 7. In March and early April distress was reported in parts of the provinces of Mosul, Arbil and Sulaimani. Many villages were found to be seriously short of food and without the means to buy grain at the high prices prevailing in the local market towns. After some delay, due to departmental muddle, supplies of barley were sent northwards from- Government stocks and were either sold at low prices or were distributed free to those without money. These supplies, together with the coming of spring grazing for their flocks, brought some relief to the needy villages but it is unlikely that they will reap much harvest in the summer as they had little seed to sow last year. Further help will therefore be necessary for them next winter. 8. The Budget for 1943/44 was presented to the Chamber of Deputies on the 15th May. Expenditure for the year was shown as I.D. 10,768,000 and Revenue was estimated at I.D. 9,082,560. The Ministry of Defence is the biggest spending department with an allotment of 3 million dinars. Of the estimated revenue about 4 million dinars is expected to be derived from Customs and Excise. The Budget has passed the Chamber and is now in the Senate. 9. Pan-Arabism is, for the time being, quiescent. The idea of a general congress to plan the future of the Arab World has not evoked the fervour for which its promoters hoped and Jamil Madfai was given a discouraging reception when, in March and April, he visited Syria, Transjordan and Egypt as the harbinger of a new advance towards Arab'unity. In Syria the political leaders, though ready with general approval for Pan-Arab principles, were too absorbed in their own problems and the forthcoming elections to be able to give active support or attention to practical schemes for federation; in Transjordan the Amir Abdullah was too jealous of the Iraqi motive to have thought for anvthin 0, but his own position and in Egypt Nahas Pasha appears to have let loose such a storm of verbosity that Jamil Madfai was stunned into silent amazement. The Minister of the Interior, Tahsin al Askari, who was in Cairo at the same time as Jamil Madfai, fared no better with the,Egyptian Prime Minister, who showed no disposition to take his cue from the Iraqi' politicians. From available reports it seems that the chief difference between their ideas and those of Nahas Pasha about an Arab Congress was that whereas the latter wished to restrict participa tion to official delegates of the Governments concerned, the former insisted that there should be £&lt; national ” or £ ‘ popular ” as well as official delegates. In the atmosphere of depression and discouragement engendered by °the set-back encountered at the enthusiastic opening of the new campaign, the Amir Abdullah’s turgid manifesto (published here on the 18th April) found no echoes and the Bagdad branch of the Arab Union Club has lapsed temporarilv into torpor. Inspired articles have continued to appear in the newspapers reasserting Arab hopes and claims but the people of the country continue to show a notable apathy towards the grandiose dreams of their political leaders. The reason for this apathy is not, I think, that people have lost faith in the Arab cause or have3 deliberately set it on one side, but rather that they are so absorbed in questions of prices and in taking daily decisions bringing intimate profit or loss that for the present other matters are excluded from their minds. Nevertheless, it would, 1 feel, be a mistake to rejoice unduly over the present lull in Pan-Arabism. Whether we like it or not, we are likely to hear a lot about Arab ambitions and claims as .time marches on, and we may expect the Prime Minister and his friends to keep ^Jthe ball actively in play. Once Parliament rises in June it is Nun Pasha’s desire to visit Cairo in person, looking in on Syria, Palestine and Transjordan en route, there no doubt to explore all possibilities of further progress. I think it very probable that he will discuss inter alia the future of liberated North Africa and. the aims of the Arab populations in Morocco, Tunisia and Libya with regard to greater autonomy and the enjoyment of the benefits implicit in the Atlantic Charter. this is a theme upon which the vernacular press in Bagdad has developed a certain eloquence since the Axis suffered its catastrophic defeat in Tunisia. 10. Ihis great Allied victory became the subject of a stream of telegrams of congratulation to the Lmbassy from all parts of the country and the Iraqi Chamber of Deputies telegraphed their good wishes to the House of Commons and to the House of Representatives. Public opinion has now finally awarded victory to the United Nations and feels itself free to discuss the future of the world on this basis, encouraged by the comfortable assumption that so far as Iraq is concerned, the war is over. 11- The current session of Parliament was prolonged for a further six weeks on the 15th April. The principal business of the period covered by this despatch was the new Law for the Regulation of the Economic Life of the Country, the Budget and the new “ Organic Law.” The first two of these laws I have already discussed and J have reported in detail on the third in a separate despatch. It is still before Parliament and I cannot foresee in what form it will emerge. It will suffice here to say that as drafted it contains nothing likely fundamentally to change the form of government of the country or the manner in which the government functions, except possibly the provisions increasing the size of the Senate which, if adopted, may strengthen considerably an already noticeable tendency on the part of the L pper House to assert its authority in parliamentary life. A new amendment to the Income Tax Law was passed by the Chamber in early May. It provides relief for the small taxpayer but raises steeply the “ super ” tax on high incomes, bringing up to 45 per cent, the tax pay able on incomes of over I.D. 7,000 a year (excluding the first I.D. 1,300 of income which is subject to ordinary income tax). The Senate is still examining this draft law and are said to regard it with disfavour. Another noteworthy measure dealt with by Parliament was a draft law to ratify a new agreement with the Iraq Petroleum Company. This provides for an interest free loan by the company to the Iraqi Government of 1\ million pounds in return for which the Government agree to the suspension until two years after the war of the drilling operations | of the Mosul Oil Company and of the geological survey of the Basra Petroleum i Company. The law was accepted by both Houses. This is the second free of interes f loan which the Iraq Petroleum Company group has given to the Iraqi Government. The first was for three million pounds given in 1939 in exchange for an amendment to the Mosul Oil Company’s concession and extended the non production period until 1944. It is possibly of interest to add that in the concluding stages American oil interests in the Companies attempted to muscle in on the deal on their own account and indicated that they would like to see an “ open door ” policy adopted in Iraq as regards oil. The Administration were, I believe, rather worried by this unexpected development and eagerly embraced the old adage about “ Better the devil we know . . . . ” etc. 12. Internal security continues to be good except for an unsatisfactory local situation in the Dohuk district of the Mosul Liwa where Salim Mustafa with his gang of criminal bandits are still at large, in spite of the efforts of the police to liquidate them. Elsewhere a few over-zealous “ Communists ” have been the only political nuisance. On different occasions pamphlets appeared in Mosul, Arbil and Basra attacking the ruling classes and the usual illicit Communist journals have continued to make their habitual spasmodic and smudgy appearance in Bag-dad. At the official opening of a new Bagdad thoroughfare on King FeisaTs Birthday on the 2nd May the wife of a well-known “ Red ” suddenly flourished a flag bearing the words ££ The Government should seize the produce from the capitalists and land-owners and safeguard the food of the people.” She was arrested and led away without arousing any demonstration of sympathy from the crowd. The popularity of Communism, nourished on the military achievements of the [44—32] B 24 U.S.S.R. and the rosiest illusions about social conditions in the Soviet Umon, is increasing and is likely to continue to increase as owing to a i k ^ j t • Axis it has at present no rival as a progressive and constructive P° 1 „ , g 13. In my despatch No. 24 of the 22nd January I informed you of the assurance given to me by the Prime Minister that he won c nolitical favour the release of any more persons who had been interned for poll ca reasons. He has recently explained to me that he said June because he was ^ confident that by then the Axis armies in North Africa would have been defea and that the situation would therefore be favourable for a review o , some of the internees. Those freed in January have done no harm an 1 f circumstances it does not seem likely that the release of a fin t lei num e minor personalities would cause the Iraqi Government any embarrassment or be injurious to the interests of His Majesty s Government. I ha\e told both the Regent and the Prime Minister that I myself see no adequate justification tor any further “ appeasement ” until the end of the war, but it is probable neveit e- less, that the Prime Minister who is being subjected to considerable pressure m Parliament and elsewhere, will take the easy course and reconstitute the previous committee under the presidency of the British Adviser to the Ministry of b^ tei ‘ 1( ? r • 14. The “ Board of Education ” created by the new Regulation tor the Organisation of the Ministry of Education which came into force m re &gt;iuary last was set up in April. It consists of the Minister of Education, two senior officials from his department, four senior officials nominated respectively by the Ministers of Education, Communications and Works, Economics and social Affairs and four members elected by the seven persons already mentioned. Professor Hamlev left for the United Kingdom on the 30th April to the great regret of all his'colleagues and, as you know, His Majesty s Government are trvino- to find a suitable successor. The summer holidays are now close at hand and educational affairs are therefore likely to be put aside for some months in favour of more urgent matters. It remains, however, as important as ever that the schools and colleges of the country should be steadily improved and I shall neglect no opportunity to continue to urge the Government to undertake the necessary reforms. . . „ 15. The Prime Minister has again been considering the reorganisation ot the army and hopes to complete his plans during the summer months when he expects to be free from parliamentary work. lie has told me that he has in mind a force consisting of a mechanised and partially armoured division of about 10,000 strong, recruited from long service volunteers, backed by a provincial militia to be 'recruited by compulsory servicemen called up for an initial training of about three to four months, with annual trainings of a fortnight or three weeks. It has been reported to me from several sources that early m May the Acting Chief of the Iraqi General Staff informed the officers of the Musaiyib garrison that a brigade of the Iraqi army would probably be sent to Syria for war duties at the end of June. He encouraged the officers to welcome such a develop ment which he maintained would help towards the realisation of Arab union. The Acting Chief of the General Staff never acts without the authority of his Minister and his talk to the officers at Musaiyib shows that Nuri Pasha still hopes somehow to persuade His Majesty’s Government to reverse the decision given last February not to accept the Iraqi Government's conditional offer of troops for service outside Iraq. Two parties of Iraqi officers have recently visited the battle fields of the Western desert of Egypt. They were most hospitably entertained by the Commander-in-chief, Middle East, and much appreciated both the kindness which they were shown and the opportunities which were given to them to study modern developments in military strategy and tactics. 16^ Measures taken in February to prevent the smuggling of sheep out of Iraq into Syria and Palestine unhappily caused some trouble with Saudi Arabia and Syria. To prevent the passage of flocks across the border, the Iraqi Government established a prohibited zone of fifty miles width along the whole length of the western and southern frontiers. Tribesmen who, in accordance with ancient customs, were honestly grazing their own flocks were not to be disturbed, but all others were ordered to keep outside the zone and military and police patrols were established to enforce this order. Unfortunately, at the beginning the Government’s intentions were not made properly known to the local officials concerned. In consequence some Syrian and some Saudi Arabian tribesmen were hustled out of the zone with undue vigour, while others had their sheep confiscated on the suspicion of being smugglers. On the Syrian frontier the local officials on each side seem to have settled these incidents by direct contact and without recourse to diplomatic action, but similar misunderstandings on the SaudiAral)ian frontier provoked strongly worded protests from King Abdul Azziz al Saud. Soothing replies and explanations were returned and I urged the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs to do whatever they could to hasten the restoration to their owners of any stock and other property taken aw 7 ay from Saudi tribesmen without really good proof that they were engaged in smuggling. 1 he smuggling season is now T over and further incidents are unlikely to occur, |^it I fear it will take some time before the Saudi complaints have been disposed 17. In early May Sheikh Chassib, eldest son of the late Sheikh Khazal, Sheikh of Muhammerah, slipped away from Basra across the Persian border and, w T ith a following of about one hundred armed men, raised the standard of revolt near Alrvvaz. Negotiations with the Persian Governor-General and consultations w r ith His Majesty's Consular Officers in the neighbourhood followed and Chassib was soon persuaded to give up this attempt to recover his father's position as a semi-independent ruler and to return to Basra. The Persian Government have naturally expressed the w r ish that steps should be taken to prevent a repetition of this escapade and the Iraqi Minister of the Interior has instructed the Mutasarrif of Basra to take such action as he thinks necessary for this purpose. 18. The spring now drawing to its close has been exceptionally fine with scarcely any dust. The incidence of typhus has decreased with the advent of the warm weather and, on the whole, public health seems to be good. The infiltration of large numbers of under-nourished Persian coolies attracted by the continued demand of the British forces for labour has, however, given rise to fears of cholera from June through the great heat. The attention of General Headquarters has been drawn to this menace and I am advised that the necessary orders have been issued for the institution of such precautions as may be possible. 19. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s Representatives at Angora, Cairo, Tehran, Jedda and Beirut, the Minister of State at Cairo, His Majesty’s High Commissioner for Palestine and Transjordan, the Governor- General of India, the Commander-in-Chief, India, General Headquarters, Middle East, the Combined Middle East Intelligence Centre, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, the Political Agent at Kpweit and to His Majesty’s Consular Officers at Basra and Mosul.

Cofuj Co A\ab , 3. ^ The Present Situation in Iraq. Memorandum by Sir Kinahan Cornwallis for the Mid,die hast War Conned. RELATIONS between Great Britain and Iraq are established on the provisions of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of Alliance of 1930 and the Iraqi Govern ment are at present carrying out satisfactorily their wartime obligations towards His Majesty’s Government under article 4 of this treaty. With the co-operation of the Iraqi Government Axis propaganda has been virtually eliminated and all persons whose activities were seriously prejudicial to harmonious relations between Great Britain and Iraq have been interned or have fled the country. In January 1943 the Iraqi Government, entirely on their own initiative, declared war on the Axis Powers and signed the declaration of the United Nations. Since then the Cabinet have been making a sincere, if not always very effective, effort to improve the country’s economic contribution to the common war effort. Current relations with His Majesty’s Government may therefore justifiably be called good. Internally the situation is tranquil, though there is a certain effervescence of youth, which tends at the moment to show a somewhat “ red ’ tinge. These two outstanding features of the present political situation, good relations with His Majesty’s Government and internal tranquillity, which are in such contrast with the hatred and strife of April and May 1941, are attributable to three main factors, the turn of the tide of the war in our favour, the presence of strong British forces, and the comparative calm of the contemporary political situation in Palestine and Syria. Iraq and Arab Union. Since her earliest days Iraq has always been strongly represented in the van of the pan-Arab movement, and her people have never failed to take a close and deeply sentimental interest in the political fortunes of her closest Arab neighbours —Palestine and Syria. The disturbances in Palestine in the late thirties diverted attention from ideas of Arab unity and federation to the more urgent issue of the fate of Palestine and her Arab population, and the outbreak of war with Germany again, for a time, put into the background thoughts of rebuilding the Arab empire of the past. Recentlv, however, faith in the ultimate victory of the United Nations and confidence in the Atlantic Charter have brought about a revival of activity directed towards a closer union of the now divided Arab States and peoples. The statement made by Mr. Eden in the House of Commons on the 25th February of this year reaffirming the sympathy of His Majesty’s Government with any movement among the Arabs to promote economic, cultural or political unity has, moreover, acted as a spur to the political leaders who are now seeking to formulate a scheme which will be able to command general approval. ikus uf M tlff'iJuii-AidU™ybJiibiiLi 1 mE It® 14^14 u-,s-s. 6 a to . 2^. v\ The protago Arab revolt of th [42-3] W1 11* TSTfiare the veterans of the aren programme, but there No. 2 6 ^ M JL M3 FROM SECRETARY, EXTERNAL DEP' INDIA OFFICE *2 is small doubt that their ultimate objective is the inclusion of all the Arab peoples in both Africa and Asia in a single Arab State. They appreciate, however, that this can only be achieved gradually by stages, and their immediate aim is to help Syria and Palestine to win independence as a necessary preliminary to their union with Iraq. They see that neither Iraq nor Syria nor Palestine is strong- enough to dispense with the support of a Great Power, but they hope that when united in a political and economic unit these countries will be able to stand alone without the invidious support of a foreign alliance and the concomitant limitation of their national sovereignty. Though they are ready to accept schemes for closer cultural and economic co-operation between these countries as helpful preliminaries, such expedients will not deter them from continuing to work for the earliest possible implementation of measures which will enable Palestine, Syria and Iraq to devote their united strength to the Arab cause. These pan-Arab leaders enjoy considerable support among their contemporaries and generally among the Sunni Arabs of the country. Most of them are now well disposed towards ourselves and, in spite of many disappointments in the past, subscribe to the principle that Arab aspirations can only be achieved through close and friendly co-operation with Great Britain. The Shiahs, who number more than i half the Arab population of the country, are, however, showing little enthusiasm for the federation idea. For some time they have been absorbed in the task of . winning political equality with the Sunnis, and they foresee that if Iraq is at all closely federated with the other Arab States, they may again recede into the status of a politically impotent religious minority. The half million Kurds are another important element in the country, indifferent, and to a small extent opposed, to pan-Arab ideals, and even among the Sunni Arabs a number of the younger men interested in politics take the view that federation should be postponed until many fundamental social and economic reforms have been carried out within Iraq itself. The leaders of the federation movement have not up to the present shown much sign of being discouraged by the negative attitude of the elements mentioned above, but the outcome of the recent pourparlers of Jamil Madfai and Tahsin al Askari with political leaders in Syria and Egypt has evidently proved disap pointing to them. It is not yet clear what further steps they will now decide to take, but they are not likely to let the matter drop for long. A branch of the Arab Union Club founded by Fuad Abbaza Pasha of Egypt has recently been established in Bagdad, but it is as yet too early to judge whether it will plav an active part in Arab politics. Iraq and Syria. It has already been mentioned that Iraqis have for long taken an interest in Syria’s struggle for independence. When British forces entered the country in 1941, there were hopes that Syria would rapidly be set on the path already trodden by Iraq. Disappointment and irritation followed with the creation of the Taj ud Din Government, and what appeared to be the reluctance of the Free French authorities to restore the Constitution, and the opportunity of Mr. Wendell Willkie’s visit to Bagdad in September 1942 was taken to submit to him a memorandum signed by two ex-Prime Ministers and the President of the Senate, urging the intervention of the United States to secure for Syria her legitimate rights. A pointed reference to Syria’s struggle for independence was also made in Nuri Pasha’s reply to the message which Mr. Churchill sent to him on the occasion of Iraq’s declaration of war on the Axis. Political developments since the death of the late President have, however, given considerable satisfac tion to political circles in Iraq and there is now less anxiety about Syria’s future prospects. Palestine. Iraq’s interest in Palestine has been even deeper than her interest in Syria and, since the end of the last war, whenever there have been political disturbances in Palestine, strong reactions in favour of the Palestine Arabs have been evident in Iraq. At the beginning of the present war the ex-Mufti of Jerusalem and a laro-e number of his most determined followers were in Iraq. Their anti-British propaganda among the people and their intrigues with the remaining diplomatic representatives of the Axis Powers were a serious menace to our position and were to a noteworthy degree the cause of Rashid Ali’s open defiance of his Maiestv’s (government in May 1941. Since the restoration of a constitutional and friendly3 Government, in deference to Iraq’s alliance with Great Britain, a tacit truce has been observed in agitation about Palestine, but towards the end of 1942 news of' Jewish arming in Palestine and of Zionist propaganda in'America x^used fears to be felt in this country that the Zionist Jews were taking advantageCf this Arab quiescence to strengthen their own position. During a visit to Cairo in December 1942, the Prime Minister discussed with Nahas Pasha the idea of addressing a request to the United States Government to dissuade their prominent citizeps from making public statements favourable to militant and extreme Zionism, and also endeavoured to induce King Abdul Aziz al Saud to take parallel action. In March 1943 the Iraqi Government communicated a memorandum to His Majesty’s ^ Government in which concern was expressed at the increase of Zionist propa- ganda in Great Britain and the United States, and added that the Iraqi Govern ment could not overlook the possible effect of such propaganda in Iraq, where the people were deeply interested in the Palestine question. His Majesty’s Govern ment, in their reply, drew attention to the answer given by the then Secretary of State for the Colonies to a question by Lord Davies in the House of Lords on the 6th May, 1942, in the following words : “ While I would make it clear that there has been no change in the policy of His Majesty’s Government with regard to Palestine, the noble Lord may rest assured that His Majesty’s Government will not enter into commitments regarding the future of that country without prior consultation with those including both Arabs and Jews whom they may judge to be concerned.” The reply added that the policy reaffirmed in that statement remained that of His Majesty’s Government. This reply appears to have been accepted. The general attitude of Iraqi Arabs towards the Palestine question is that ^hey are resigned to the policy of the Palestine White Paper of 1939 and regard it (as the declared and accepted policy of His Majesty’s Government. They look forward to the early implementation of its constitutional provisions, and many hope that this having been done the way will be clear for Palestine to enter into closer political, cultural and economic relations with her neighbours. Any material whittling away of the safeguards provided for the Arabs in the White Paper, and especially any relaxation of its restrictions on Jewish immigration, would be regarded as a serious breach of faith and would provoke dangerous reactions in this country, where our politico-strategic interests are likely in the difficult post war years to assume even greater importance than they do to-day. In particular, the large Jewish community would be in jeopardy. The Iraqi Prime Minister has set out his personal views on the future of Palestine and Syria and on the Federation of the Arab States in a lengthy memorandum which he addressed in January last to the Minister of State at Cairo. It began with a renewed protest against current Zionist claims and propaganda, went on to review the recent history of Syria and Palestine, and concluded with a recommendation that the United Nations should immediately declare the federation of Syria, the Lebanon, Palestine and Transjordan into one State and promote the formation of an Arab Union, to which this Greater Syria and Iraq should adhere at once and other Arab States join at will. 26^/i A pril, 1943.UA opv THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC AaJESSY'S GOVERNMENT ' t 1 r IRAQ. the Ccmpl!rr»efft5» _of the U ?ec^«tapy o* State CON IIDENTIAL. fo?’ Fore Aff£Lf?*ii eo (V n\i° k » j X- BECo.

Cornwallis to- Mr. Eden. — {Received A pril 19.) V) ff! ( N °. Hi.) Z^a Sir, Bagdad March 28, 1943. ^ (f IN my despatch No. 24 of the 22nd January, I reported Iraq’s formal declaration of war on the Axis Powers and her adhesion to the declaration of the l nited Nations made at Washington on the 2nd January, 1942. This action seems to have caused noticeable heartburning to neighbouring Govern ments. Egypt, Syria, Persia and Saudi Arabia all hurriedly took stock of their respective positions in relation to this event and, though their reactions varied with their individual circumstances, all apparently felt that Iraq had cleverly stolen a march on them. 2. In Iraq itself, the first tangible fruits of the declaration were a conditional offer of a small armed force to help Great Britain and a praise worthy effort to give more effective co-operation in providing grain supplies for other countries in the Middle East. On the 8th February the Prime Minister called on me to offer to send a force of a maximum strength of one mixed brigade to Turkey, if the war should come there, and to detail a second brigade for duty as garrison troops in Palestine or Syria. As I reported at the time, I do not believe that service abroad would be well received by either the Iraqi army or the public, and the political objections to the sending of Iraqi troops to Palestine or Syria are grave and obvious. I accordingly welcomed your instruc tions to tell the Prime Minister that, though His Majesty’s Government were grateful for this offer, they had come to the conclusion that the best help that the Iraqi army could give was to continue to co-operate in the protection of military communications in their own country. Nuri Pasha took this decision in good part, though he maintained, as was only to be expected, that I was at fault in thinking that service outside Iraq would be unpopular. 3. Although Nuri Pasha would not commit himself publicly at the time of Iraq’s declaration of war to help neighbouring countries in respect of cereals, I made full use of the new situation in pressing home both on him and the Minister of Finance that it was the duty of the Iraqi Government now that they were belligerents to take energetic and determined action in order to provide the barley so sorely needed in Persia and Turkey. After constant representations a notification was eventually published on the 13th January fixing prices and establishing Government control over ad sales of barley. The notification was the Government’s first important endeavour to co-operate more fully on the economic front and represented a major step towards proper control of cereals, and stabilisation of cereal prices. The main points were— (a) In the liwas of Bagdad, Hillah, Diwaniyah, Muntafiq. Kut, Diyala, Amara and Dulaim the Government required all persons to surrender any stocks of barley which they held in excess of their own require ments for food. {b) The prices fixed were I.D. 19 a ton for grain declared up to the 28th February; I.D. 17 a ton for later declaration up to the. 15th March and I.D. 15 a ton for stocks registered from the 15th March to the 31st March. Unregistered barley found after the 31st March to be confiscated with a nominal payment not to exceed I.D. 10 a ton. Even after the Cabinet had agreed to the measures which it embodies for the control of barley, the publication of the notification was unexpectedly held up at the last moment owing to the annoyance caused to the Minister of Finance by some remarks made by the Prime Minister during a debate in the Senate on the Government’s economic policy. The Prime Minister admitted that the Govern ment’s action had so far been inadequate and unsuccessful, but promised better measures in the near future. Salih Jabr felt that these remarks implied a criticism of his own work as Minister of Finance and left the meeting determined to resign. So soon as I learnt of this contretemps I saw both Ministers separately Apd spo ke to each of the folly of breaking up the Cabinet at this juncture. The2 Prime Minister protested that his admission was unavoidable and that he had intended no criticism of Salih Jabr’s work. But Salih Jabr was aggrieved and upset and disposed to entertain the worst suspicions. I was able, nevertheless, to persuade them to meet each other and eventually a reconciliation was effected. This was the last and most threatening of the many hitches which had impeded the desired action and the notification was thereafter signed by Salih Jabr and brought into operation. Up to the present nearly 50.000 tons of barley have been registered, and of this quantity the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation have already purchased about 25.000 tons for export. While the amount the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation are likely to obtain from the total quantity now available will enable deliveries to be made to Turkey and Persia on a fairly satisfactory scale for about two months, the deficiencies in those two countries, especially the second, are so great that it is essential that the Iraqi Government should embark on more forceful and effective action to unearth further substantial quantities of barley known to exist in Iraq. I shall continue to exert all possible pressure to secure such action and have arranged for the Political Advisory staff to co-operate with and spur on the local administration in their efforts to locate and obtain possession of more barley, 4. Of less immediate importance but of considerable potential consequence is the new “ Law for the Regulation of the Economic Life of the Country ” now before Parliament. This supersedes the original law enacted in 1942 and places the direction of economic policy and supplies in the hands of a Cabinet Committee of three members with the Prime Minister as chairman. It will also permit the transfer of the control of grains and most local produce from Finance to Interior where a new department, largely under the influence of the British advisers, will be set up. This new legislation will certainly cause a considerable, and possibly angry, flutter in the parliamentary dovecotes, and I shall be pleasantly surprised if it escapes serious mutilation at the hands of reactionary believers in the ■out-worn theories of laissez-faire. 5. Transport has already been placed under the executive control of Colonel Le Blanc, an energetic officer of wide experience. I welcome this appoint ment for two main reasons. Firstly, Colonel Le Blanc should be invaluable in bringing about much-needed organisation of Iraqi road transport. Secondly, since this officer was selected for his present post by the late Commander-in-Chief, Persia/Iraq Force, his presence will be a comfort to General Headquarters, who, prior to his arrival, were not unnaturally reluctant to release to the Iraqi authorities valuable material, such as tyres, &amp;c., which, though consigned to this country on civilian account, they feared might be misused in one form or another. Iraqi irritation over delays in securing possession of such equipment, and over the military use of some 40 per cent, of available civil transport vehicles, threatened at one moment to give rise to political complications. I should perhaps add here that the Prime Minister and others have also displayed a certain sensitiveness over the extent of British military participation in the control and operation of the Iraqi State Railways, with the result that from time to time I feel obliged to use my good offices in consultation with the commander-in-chief, to prevent occasional ruffled waters being seriously disturbed by angry squalls. If I mention these matters it is merely to illustrate the constant watchfulness that is necessary to ensure that minor difficulties do not deteriorate into major complexities. 6. A further development in the Government’s economic policy was the setting up, early in the new year, of a committee “ to examine the question of making grants of certain commodities to deserving classes of the people.” The committee’s report which has recently come into my hands, recommends the distribution at low prices of soap, vegetable oil, rice and cloth to officials, policemen and all regular Government employees. Considerable quantities of soap have in fact already been distributed as well as 8,000 metres of cloth. Special plans are being studied for the distribution of essential commodities on a wider scale. Notwithstanding these activities, the Administration continue to be much criticised for the slowness with which they are grasping the economic nettle, and for their continued subserviency to powerful agricultural and mercantile vested interests. The fact is that the Prime Minister with his head full of Pan-Arab dreams, is reluctant to offend any potential political “ friends.” 7. While I have been engaged in bringing the Iraqi Government to the point of making available part of the surplus produce of the country for export to needy neighbours, the Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance have not ceased to press for more active help from His Majesty’s Government. Their most urgent demands have concerned a gold backing for a national loan, to be3 raised to reduce the steadily increasing amount of currency in circulation, the release of more civil transport from British army use, the reduction of the number of sheep consumed by our forces, the provision of lease-lend agricultural machinery and the supply to the Government, instead of to merchants, of piece- goods, soap, matches, coffee and tea for controlled distribution. I have reported separately on all these questions and it is unnecessary for me to deal with them ^in detail here. It will suffice to record that the visit to Bagdad in early March ^Pof Sir Arthur Rucker and Mr. Lloyd from the Minister of State’s office in Cairo and the talks which they had with Nuri Pasha and Salih Jabr encouraged the Iraqi Government to believe that we were doing our best for them and in fact led to practical help being given in several ways. There remain, however, several demands which have not yet been met, and provided that the Iraqi Government continue to give their co-operation in plans to satisfy our urgent grain require ments it will, in my opinion, be well for us to deal with these demands sympathetically. It must frankly be confessed that the popularity of the Middle Last Supply Centre has lately waned in this country where it is hard for local politicians and others to appreciate the difficulty of persuading other countries to co-operate in easing Iraq’s burdens unless it is clearly in their own interest. Moreover, Iraqi opinion cannot see why the Middle East Supply Centre should worry over such problems as the 5 dhow traffic in the Persian Gulf, for there is naturally little sympathy for the theory that all available supplies should be equally distributed to Middle Eastern territories. As, in fact, there is small hope of establishing effective control over the dhows, I have advised that to avoid unnecessary forfeiture of goodwill, the notion should be dropped. 8. A political feature of the first quarter of the current year has been the revival of Arab nationalist activity. Beginning with a negative reaction to ebullient Zionism, it later developed into a positive endeavour to find a means of laying the foundations of Arab unity. Towards the end of January, Nuri Pasha addressed a long memorandum to the Minister of State at Cairo on the subject of Arab national affairs. It began with a renewed protest against current Zionist claims and propaganda, went on to review the history of Syria, Palestine and Iraq since the last war, and concluded with a recommendation that the United Nations should immediately declare the federation of Syria, the Lebanon, Palestine and Transjordan into one State, and promote the formation of an Arab l nion to which this Greater Syria and Iraq should adhere at once and others join at will. The Prime Minister printed and sent copies of this memorandum to the Viceroy of India, the Dominions Prime Ministers and a number of English gentlemen in public life who have in some way officially or unofficially been associated with one or other of the Arab countries. The Prime Minister also acquainted King Ibn Saud, through the Saudi Legation in Bagdad, and the Amir Abdullah (by personal letter) with the essential features of his proposals. Having himself thus made an effort to direct and stimulate interest in Arab federation, Nuri Pasha naturally warmly welcomed your statement in the House of Commons- reiterating the assurance first given at the Mansion House in May 1941 that His Majesty’s Government would regard with sympathy any movement among the Arabs to promote economic, cultural or political unity. Your remark that the initiative must clearly come from the Arabs themselves spurred him, moreover, to further action, and he arranged for Jamil Madfai, a former Prime Minister and veteran of the Arab movement, to visit Syria and Transjordan discreetly to consult political leaders and to seek agreement with them on a common policy. Before he left Bagdad, Jamil Madfai told me that he and his friends had been much encouraged by your statement and felt that the Arab leaders should at once begin the serious study of the problem of Arab federation. He assured me that I could rely on his entire discretion. He knew that the realisation of Arab hopes depended on the support of His Majesty’s Government, and he wished to avoid any action likely to embarrass us. 9. According, to the information given to me by Nuri Pasha. Arab leaders in Palestine have also been moved by your promise of British sympathy to consider how they can help to produce an agreed plan for the closer integration of the divided Arab countries, and both they and the Amir Abdullah of Transjordan appear to have been thinking of gathering together a congress or conference to discuss details. Meanwhile, Tahsin Askarr, Minister of the Interior, and Tahsin Ali, Minister of Education, have been busy arranging for the opening in Bagdad of a branch of the Arab Union Society (Nadi al Ittihad al Arabi) recently founded in Egypt. The declared objects of tfie society include work for a closer co-opera tion between all Arab countries and the defence of the rights of the Arab world. Experience has made me suspicious of societies of this kind, and I have remindedx 4 the Prime Minister of the harm done by the Muthanna Club, and have urged that the branch or branches opened in Iraq should be kept under the closest super vision. The committee of the society was elected a few days ago. The majority, of the members are men of moderate views and the zealots of the Muthanna have been excluded. 10. Security continues everywhere to be good, and pro-Axis propaganda is not at present a factor of importance in the political life of the country. The Prime Minister has discussed with me his desire to bring to trial in Iraq the surviving persons who were charged before the military court set up in January 1942 to deal with the organisers of the coup d'Etat of April 1941. I told his Excellency that before I could recommend His Majesty's Government to send these persons back to Iraq from Southern Rhodesia, I should need to be assured that all his colleagues agreed with his wish to have them tried. There is, I hear, a difference of opinion on this matter among members of the Cabinet, and the Prime Minister seems to have dropped his proposal, at any rate for the time being. 11. On the 22nd February an official notification was published in the newspapers summoning all Iraqis living in enemy or enemy-occupied territory to return within two months to Iraq, and threatening those who failed to do so with trial in absentia by court-martial. No exemptions were provided for persons who were detained against their wishes or unable to find the means of returning to their homes, but the Minister for Foreign Affairs informs me that the Govern ment's purpose is only to prosecute well-known renegades, such as the Berlin broadcaster, Tunis Bahri, and a number of young officers and students who fled to Europe through Turkey after the collapse of Rashid Ali 's Administration in 1941. 12. Apart from the declaration of war, little of importance has occurred in Iraq's foreign affairs since the beginning of the year, but there are two events which should perhaps be recorded. M. Kadlec, who has recently been appointed Czechoslovak Minister at Tehran, spent several days in Bagdad early in March* en route to his post. He approached the Iraqi Government with a view to obtaining their official recognition of the Czechoslovak Government and their agreement to his appointment as Minister here. It appears probable that both proposals will be accepted. Secondly, in early March the Government regularised the position of the American and Polish forces in Iraq by obtaining the consent of Parliament to a law granting to all Allied forces which are duly constituted in Iraq the same judicial immunities and privileges as those already enjoyed by the British forces. 13. The excitements of nationalist politics and of turbulent economics have* of late heavily eclipsed the affairs of the Ministry of Education which a short time ago occupied so much attention. Nevertheless, some progress has been made towards reform since the two discredited Directors-General, Dr. Sami Shaukat- and Dr. Fadhil Jamali. were relieved of their appointments. Other changes have- also been made among the senior officials of the Ministry and the way has now been opened for a further advance in the desired direction. Whether it will be achieved is a moot question, as unhappily Sadek Gohar, the new Egyptian expert at the Ministry of Education, is proving very difficult to work with and is becoming extremely unpopular in Iraqi circles. It is regrettable, too, that Professor Hamley, v/hose health has of late been indifferent, appears determined to leave for the United Kingdom as soon as possible after the termination of his contract in April. 14. Ihe winter now ended has, climatically-speaking, been very pleasant and (what is more important) endowed with a bountiful rainfall. The prospects for the coming harvest, provided we are spared unforeseen pests or disease, are excellent. Taken by and large, this country, notwithstanding its economic difficulties, is remarkably blessed in comparison with its immediate neighbours, with many of its inhabitants enjoying considerable prosperity. All this was : reflected in the demeanour of the crowds who recently celebrated the birthday of the Prophet on a cool day of brilliant spring sunshine. 15. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s representatives- at Angora, Cairo, Tehran, Jedda and Beirut, the Minister at State at Cairo His Majesty’s High Commissioner for Palestine and Transjordan, the Governor-.

This sort of talk, with its underlying implication that through their sins of omission the British are to blame for the woes of the Iraqi people, tends to throw the British officer or official on the defensive and even to induce in him a quite unnecessary feeling of guilt for his country’s alleged shortcomings. 2. It is a mistake to be bamboozled in this way by such specious talk about our so-called responsibilities to the people, their looking to us to maintain the principles of equity and justice and losing faith in us if we fail. The Iraqis wanted their independence; they still want it, and they would quite rightly fight if we tried to take it away. But unless we take over the administration, we cannot hope to ensure justice and we cannot assume real control without depriving Iraq of its independence. 3. The hard fact is that a people get the government they deserve and, conversely, a government usually gets the electorate it deserves. The Iraqis often enough moan about the injustice and put the blame on us, but they seldom voice their views in public or stir a finger themselves to put things right. Until they do so they will neither enjoy or deserve a better government and it is well to rub this in. 4. As for ourselves, our chief task during the war is to see that friendly relations are maintained with the Iraqi Government and the people and to do all we can to ensure that the country makes a respectable contribution to the war effort of the United Nations. In doing this, we must also think of the future and endeavour to lay a foundation of friendship which will ensure the continuance of our influence in peacetime. It may be said that the more justice we can introduce the easier will be our task. This is true up to a point but not to the point where our interference prejudices our relations with the Iraqi Government and thereby our essential aims. 5. Experience has shown that it is useless for us to force British officials on the Iraqi Government. We can and should suggest, but if we impose, the officials are frozen out and become objects of resentment. The Iraqis must themselves work out their own salvation. We can offer help but the days when we could force the acceptance of assistance in internal administration are gone. 6. My object in writing this minute is to try and put the position in its proper perspective.

As regards the ministerial esolution, however, I would invite your attention to the fact that the published 'sion differs from the original retained in the State archives through the omission of the proviso contained in article 1 recording that Iraq, in declaring war against the three Aixs Powers, “ shall not be liable to any obligations other than those contained in the Treaty of Alliance between Iraq and Great Britain signed on the 30th June, 1930.” I understand that there was considerable argument in the Cabinet over this reservation, the retention of which was opposed by Nuri Pasha and the Minister for Foreign Affairs. However, they finally had to bow to the will of a majority of their colleagues, who insisted that the 'terms of the resolution should dovetail with the notes exchanged beween Abdul Illah Hafidh and myself on the 13th January and copied to you in my despatch No. 13 ff of that date. When I raised the issue myself with the Prime Minister his Excellency evinced a marked reluctance to return to the charge against his cautious colleagues. In the circumstances, and having regard to the terms of the exchange of notes, I did not consider that any useful purpose would be served by attempting to press the matter. 3.

Resolution adopted by the Council of Ministers at their Fourth Meeting assembled at 12 noon on January 11, 1943. THE Council of Ministers met under the presidency of his Excellency Sayid Nuri Said, Prime Minister and Acting Minister of Defence, the following members being present:— His Excellency Sayid His Excellency Sayid His Excellency Sayid His Excellency Sayid His Excellency Sayid tions and Works. His Excellency Sayid His Excellency Sayid His Excellency Sayid Abdul Ilah Hafidh, Minister for Foreign Affairs. Tahsin al Askari, Minister of Interior. Salih Jabr, Minister of Finance. Daoud al Haidari, Minister of Justice. Ahmad Mukhtar Baban, Minister of Communica- Tahsin Ali, Minister of Education. Salman al Barrak, Minister of Economics. Abdul Razzaq al Uzri, Minister of Social Affairs. The Council considered the proposal signed by the majority of Deputies which the Chamber decided to refer to the Government and which was forwarded to the office of the Prime Minister by the President of the Chamber of Deputies under his letter No. 69 dated the 12th November, 1942. [38-66] • L B 'J.2 The Council also considered a memorandum submitted by the Prime Minister, No. 125, dated the 11th January, 1943. i a i r ' 4 M In view of the hostile attitude which has been adopted for a long time by the Axis Powers against Iraq and of the continued activities through their agents for the destruction of the legitimate Iraqi Government and of the pressure brought to bear on the Iraq Parliam^np (as revealed in the Parliamentary resolution adopted by both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate on thty'*^ ^ 11th November, 1941, and the 15th November, 1941, respectively), and in view 1 of the openly hostile action taken ky them during May 1941; and in view of the persistence of the Axis Powers in their hostile attitude from then to the present time by the attacks directed against Iraq and her interests through their broad casting stations; and in view of their continued efforts to create differences and dissensions between the various communities of Iraq, with the object of endangering public security and public order by spreading false rumours and lying news through their broadcasting stations as well as by all other means available to them; And in view of the fact that the Broadcasting authorities of the Axis Powers openly and unceasingly use abusive expressions which are intended to impair the dignity of the Royal Family and so undermine the loyalty of the Iraqi people; and also in view of the fact that the Axis Powers encouraged those persons ^ho defied the law and attempted to overthrow the constitutional system of their country and have, after the escape of these persons from Iraq, harboured and maintained them; And whereas the interests of Iraq in particular and of. the Arab peoples in general make it imperative that Iraq should adhere to the Declaration of the United Nations signed at Washington on the 2nd January, 1942, which was based on the Atlantic Charter signed by the President of the United States and the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland on the 14th August, 1941; and this in view of the lofty principles embodied in the said document, guaranteeing to all nations, small or great, their liberties and independence as well as their integrity; After the perusal of article 26 (8) of the Organic Law, the Council passed the following resolution :— (i) Iraq shall be deemed to be in a state of war with the three Axis Powers, provided that Iraq shall not be liable to any obligations other than those contained in the Treaty of Alliance between Iraq and Great Britain signed on the 30th June, 1930. (ii) Iraq shall adhere to the Declaration of the United Nations signed in Washington on the 2nd January, 1942. (iii) The Ministry for Foreign Affairs shall take any action necessary to give effect to this resolution. Enclosure 2. Memorandum, January 11, 1943. THE principal foundations upon which any democratic State should stand may be outlined as follows :—■ {a) A definite system of government, determining the basic institutions and powers of the State concerned and ensuring her progress towards the realisation of her own ideals, the establishment of justice therein and the development of her vital resources in the political, administrative, constructive, economic, social and other fields. ' Such a system is usuallv ensured by an organic law which stipulates that the conduct of the affairs of the State shall be under the supervision of a Parliament whose designation and composition vary with different States. (b) A head, whom the people entrusts with the supreme leadership of the country and who is invested with powers enabling him to direct the policy of the State and control the proper functioning of the machine thereof in accordance with its Constitution and the laws derived therefrom.A force, composed of all the various armed services, to safeguard the integrity of the State and defend the country against any internal or external menaces. In the present age such a force is, as a general rule, supported by international relationships, which ensure the safety of the State and which are reinforced by treaties and pacts, whereb} the State is linked with certain other States to whom it is drawn closer by common interests and conformity of aims. Recently, such international relationship has become very important not only in the case of small and new States but also in the case of great Powers, no matter how large and powerful they may be, such as the Allied and the Axis Powers which have been interrelated with a network of treaties all of which aim at safeguarding the existence and ensuring the safety and interest ofthe State concerned. One must look forward to the gradual expansion of these international relationships as, owing to the increased complexity and development of international interests due to modern inventions, it is quite impossible for any single State to live isolated from the rest of the world. Any impairment in the above foundations in any State will inevitably threaten the very existence of that State and harm her in proportion to the extent of the defect. 2. If the modern history of Iraq is carefully examined it will appear that the young Iraqi State was only founded after the last Great War, i.e., the war of 1.914—18. Iraq at once commenced to consolidate gradually her three foundations, beginning with entrusting the sovereignty of the nation to the hands of the late King Faisal I, the founder of modern Iraq and restorer of her ancient glory. Then followed the enactment of her organic law, the raising of her armed forces, the delimitation of her frontiers, the conclusion of the Treaty of Alliance between Iraq and Great Britain whose interests coincided with the independence of Iraq, and finally her admission to the League of Nations and adherence to the Covenant thereof. For her existence and stability during that period Iraq was only indebted, next to God, to the efforts of her loyal sons, to the Great House of Hashim and to the British Government, who deemed it to be in her own interest to support the wishes of the people of Iraq. As a matter of fact not one of all the great and the small countries of the world, including those who call themselves now the Axis Powers, agreed to recognise the independence of Iraq except only through the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty which was approved and welcomed by all Arab countries. Even all the leading personalities of Egypt, foremost among them the Egyptian Wafd party, were unanimous in recommending the conclusion of a treaty of alliance by Egypt with Great Britain on the same lines. 3. It is extremely regrettable that soon after the Iraqi State had been founded and stabilised fate should make her suffer the tragic loss of her great leader and founder, King Faisal I, just at the beginning of her new life. Eventually, she had to face many difficulties and was threatened with innumerable dangers, whereby elements of weakness crept into her Constitution. As soon as the policy of aggression began to assert itself a few years ago by the acts of certain ambitious States, the representatives of some of those Powers were allowed to seize every opportunity for aggravating that state of weakness in Iraq by getting into touch with certain evil elements in the country, such as selfish and adventurous persons, and encouraging their dangerous activities. The result was that the wicked intentions of those Powers towards Iraq, in particular, and the Arab countries, in general, were a proved fact beyond all doubts in spite of their pretended sympathy for the Arab cause as expressed through their proteges, mouthpieces and sycophants. In this way those Powers were able to take advantage of the weak points in Iraq, to encourage the agents of destruction and to widen the sphere of their action, thus striking heavy blows against the very basis of the three foundations upon which she rests. If, in fact, the agents, who have placed themselves at the disposal of those foreign Powers who are eager to devour their country, were asked to state what made them serve those Powers, they would be unable to justify their shameful conduct which most dangerously threatened the very existence and vital interests of their country. 4. Even before the present war certain aggressive Powers began to carry out their abominable policy by resorting to force and invaded some countries with their armed forces. The extent of their aggression steadily increased and finally led to a declaration of war between the Axis Powers, on the one side, [38—66] b 2and, Great Britain and her Allies, on the other. The war has since so spread that it has attained its present degree of magnitude. The right policy that should have been adopted by all States—particularly those that are small and recently created—was to denounce and, resist any aggressive policy pursued by any bullying Power. Had all the States of the world combined, before the outbreak olt the present war, and agreed that each one would join in opposing any armed aggression even if the State attacked was a distant one unconnected with them by special ties or interests, we should not have recentl)/^ witnessed one State after another losing their independence and becoming victims of aggression, with all the sufferings and evils entailed thereby. Events have proved that to be indifferent to aggression is to encourage it and to allow it to expand and spread until in time it attains its climax. The Axis Powers, who did so much harm to Iraq by encouraging and nourish ing the elements of weakness therein, have gradually put into execution their aggressive plans and have succeeded in widening the scope of their plans so that a large number of countries, such as Czechoslovakia, Poland, Yugoslavia, Greece, Norway Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Siam, and even some parts of China, Russia, and the possessions of the United States, are now groaning under the oppressive yoke of Axis occupation. There is clear evidence of the threat of an early extension of armed aggression to other States and countries at the first opportunity, and among those threatened are the Iraq State and other Arab countries where the Axis Powers have indulged in secret and open intrigue and propaganda for some years past. Undoubtedly, most of the loyal leaders in those countries now regret their failure to resist the policy of aggression in its initial stages and realise the folly of their once cherished belief that they could save their countries from aggression by being indifferent to the aggressive acts which, as onlookers, they saw being committed in detail against other States. Had all the victims adopted at the outset the wise policy of each country promptly resisting aggression as it occurred to the full extent of her capacity, the outlook of the present world war would have now been quite a different one and, perhaps, the leaders and promoters of this aggressive policy would not have put it into effect. 5. The policy of armed aggression met with a great success at the beginning of the war and brought destruction upon all the countries which the powers of evil were able to enter. In 1940 the Axis victories attained their climax and began to threaten materially the whole world with the evils of subjugation and destruction. The policy of treachery and destruction adopted by the Axis Powers caused a shock of terror and anxiety unprecedented in the annals of history. The world then turned towards heaven, searching for a ray of hope to enlighten the dark future. During those hard times and before the United States entered the war, Mr. Winston Churchill, the Prime Minister of Great Britain, and Mr. Franklin D. Roosevelt met and announced on the 14th August, 1941, the f ‘ Atlantic Charter,” by which they expressed the common principles underlying the policy of their respective countries for the guarantee of a happy future when peace, co-operation and confidence will replace doubt, suspicion and rivalry amongst the peoples of the world. The Charter consists of eight articles, of which the second and third ones specially concern us. They read :— Second .—They desire to see no territorial changes that do not accord with the freely expressed wishes of the peoples concerned. Third .—They respect the right of all peoples to choose the form of government under which they will live, and they wish to see sovereign rights and self-government restored to those who have been forcibly deprived of them. These two articles enlighten the path along which the Arab cause is advancing. They contain the cures for its complications and sound principles for the solution of its problems, as well as the means for the attainment of its ideals. Undoubtedly, these principles will continue to be valid as long as the American people have unanimously resolved to take part in world affairs under Mr. Roosevelt’s leadership for the benefit of the American people as well as for that of the whole world. The most important factor in shattering the belief of men in international justice and shaking the spirit of mutual confidence among nations after the last world war was undoubtedly the withdrawal of the Government of the United5 States from the field of European politics and their refusal to support the ideals which they had themselves promulgated and undertaken to ensure. This negative attitude of the American Government gave a free hand to the other victorious States, who were bound to one another with pledges from which it was not easy for them to be released. This led to certain difficulties and serious consequences in which, unfortunately, some of the Arab countries had a share. The return of the United States to the policy of participation in world ^^Jpolitics will help to remove many of the difficulties that may arise from previous international pledges—especially any secret ones—and will ensure international justice according to the provisions of the Atlantic Charter. It is most unlikely that the Government of the United States will abstain from associating itself with general international affairs at the end of the present war, for they have already witnessed with their own eyes the misfortunes and calamities which befell the world as a result of their withdrawal from participation in world affairs after the last war, as well as the horrors and sufferings of the present struggle, which surpass anything that occurred in any previous war. 6. After the aggravation of the Axis aggression and the entry of the United States into the war, delegates from twenty-six States, representing the inhabitants of more than two-thirds of the whole civilised world, met in Washington and published the Declaration of the United Nations which confirms the principles embodied in the Atlantic Charter and which aims at defeating the policy ol aggression. In this declaration they have left the door open for all the nations who may or will help or contribute materially in the common struggle to adhere to it. 7. It is evident that it is in the vital interest of Iraq (being a State bound by the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of Alliance, as well as by the Covenant of the League of Nations, and being intent upon carrying out her international obligations with all candour and sincerity) to support any policy which tends to ensure the freedom of peoples and resist aggression, especially when it is realised that in the fore front of the States which back this policy stands the country which has already proved by her action her friendly attitude to Iraq and shown that her interests do accord with Iraq’s independence. On the other hand, the object of the states who have adopted the policy of aggression has always been to obliterate the political existence of Iraq and encourage every movement started by Iraq’s enemies in and out of this country. It was the duty of Iraq to stand by the side of her Ally, Great Britain, and her Allies ever since the declaration of this war. But she was unable to do so owing to her being engaged in combating Axis intrigues. The most obvious evidence which proves the wicked intentions of those Powers towards Iraq is what they have done, and are still doing, in spreading false rumours and m intriguing against this country, and in continuing their attacks directed by their broadcasting stations against the noble House of Hashim and abusing every person who may be legitimately in power in Iraq. By all this they hoped to persuade Iraq to disavow her legal pledges as stipulated in the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of Alliance. This is so while the Axis Powers themselves have only recognised our existence and independence through and as a result of this treaty of alliance with Great Britain. The wicked intentions of the Axis were most evident during the notorious rebellion of May 1941, which they not only organised and provided the necessary funds for, but also actively supported. Moreover, the Axis Powers endeavoured to provide arms and funds to the leaders of that rebellion in ordei to maintain it and aggravate its damaging results, which severely injured our country and imperilled its very existence. „ . . ^ . The Axis officials proved the real interest of their Governments in the anaiis of Iraq upon their arrival in this country in the course of that notorious rebellion. The first thing they did was to loot at once whatever Iraqi products they could lay their hands on and send large quantities of these to their countries 'j'tm Axis Powers were not content with the loss and damage they had done to life and property. They are now harbouring a numbei of the leadei s of that rebellion and their followers who escaped from justice, and are forcing them to engage in propaganda against their country in order to obtain the means of SU-fosi All these activities are positively hostile in character. Every evidence indicates that such acts are only a cloak covering preparations for armed hostile action which the Axis will not hesitate to direct against Iraq whenever an opportunity arises. What the Axis have done to Iraq they also did, and are still doing, to all the other Arab countries whom they aim at enslaving, as everybody knows.6 8. It is obvious from the above that the Axis Powers have been aiming at the destruction of Iraq as a State; for years they have exerted unceasing efforts to achieve this. Ever since the outbreak of war they have been openly hostile in their attitude towards this country, and have actually most dangerously threatened its existence. Had it not been for the mercy of God, Iraq would have now been subjected to all those forms of looting, persecution and bondage which are being endured by the countries who have passed under the Axis yoke. The majority of the Chamber of Deputies expressed their desire that Irag^* should adhere to the Atlantic Charter (vide President of the Chamber's letter No. 69, dated the 12th November, 1942). The adherence of Iraq to the Declara tion of the United Nations will enable her to stand formally side by side with the United Nations who are struggling for the principles of freedom and justice. Moreover, such adherence will greatly assist Iraq to attain her national ideals and objectives, in her internal as well as external policies, which have been announced on several occasions and which have in view the welfare of Iraq and that of the Arab countries which are struggling to obtain their freedom and independence. Moreover, the liabilities to be borne by this country as a result of the adherence to the said Declaration are, under no circumstances, expected to be other than those for which she had pledged herself under the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty and the Covenant of the League of Nations. As it is in the interest of Iraq to rely upon the Atlantic Charter and adhere to the Declaration of the United Nations, the Government have taken the necessary steps for the declaration of a state of war between Iraq and the Axis Powers, as well as for the adherence of Iraq to that Declaration, relying on the help and support of Almighty God.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT HIS Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad presents his compliments to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and has the honour - to transmit to him herewith a codv of an exchange of notes between His Majesty s IN accordance with the provisions of article 1 of the Treaty of Alliance concluded between Iraq and Great Britain in June 1930, I have the honour to inform your Fxcellency that the Iraqi Government have under consideration a resolution declaring a state of war between Iraq and all the Axis States and a formal adherence by the Iraqi Government to the Declaration of the I nited Nations made at Washington on the 2nd January, 1942. 2. Before taking this step, however, the Iraqi Government would be glad if your Excellency would confirm that adherence to the above-mentioned declaration will not involve Iraq in any wider obligations than those which she has already assumed under article 4 of the 1 reaty of Alliance of 1930. I take this opportunity to renew to your Excellency the assurance of my I HAVE the honour to acknowledge receipt of your note of to-day s date concerning the resolution which the Iraqi Government have under consideration for a declaration of a state of war between Iraq and all the Axis Powers and the formal adherence by the Iraqi Government to the Declaration of the United Nations made at Washington on the 2nd January, 1942, and in reply thereto to inform your Excellency that His Majesty’s Government have ascertained that the United States Government would regard the furnishing by Iraq to the I nited Nations of all facilities and assistance in their power, including the use of aero dromes, ports, rivers, railways and means of comnfunication in Iraq, as con stituting material assistance and contributions against the common enemies and consequently as qualifying Iraq for adherence to the Declaration of the United Nations. On these grounds I am therefore authorised by His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to confirm the view of the Iraqi Government that Iraq, after having declared a state of war against the Axis Powers, would not by her accession to the declaration incur any wider obligations than those w hich she has already assumed under the Anglo-lraqi Treaty of Alliance.

He said that ,f * although strictly speaking Iraq was not bound to do more than was laid down in the treaty he and his Government felt that was not enough and that it was their duty to contribute to the utmost of their power towards ultimate victory irrespective of treaty obligations. Furthermore he was of the opinion that it would be good for the moral [sic ? morale] of the nation to take an active part in the war and he felt strongly that the suffering caused by German wickedness in 1941 should be avenged. 2. If his offer was welcomed Jie said that the Iraqi Government would be able to send up to a maximum of a mixed brigade' ' to Turkey if that country became involved in the war and, if His Majesty's Government wished to release British forces in Palestine or Syria, a second brigade could be made available for duty on L of C or wherever required. He thought that service in any of the three countries (but not elsewhere) would be popular and that there would be no difficulty in obtaining volunteers. 3. I thanked His Excellency for his offer which I was' sure would be greatly appreciated by His Majesty’s Government to whom I would convey it. The matter was primarily a military one on which I would not express an opinion beyond pointing out that if it was accepted in principle such questions as finance, training and the provision of equipment might provide practical difficulties. While I could not say what the attitude of His Majesty's Government would be I thought that in view of the unpreparedness of the Iraqi army, it might well be held that Iraq could best contribute to the common cause by adopting a vigorous economic policy and ensuring that all surplus grain was made available.

I do not believe service abroad would be well received and political objections to sending Iraqi troops to Palestine and Syria are obvious. 6. This somev/hat belated offer from the Prime Minister may' be partly due to a realisation that his policy following on the declaration of war was not gaining our sympathy; it is no doubt partly for the greater glory of Iraq. Whatever the reason the offer has been formally made and the Prime Minister has. shown considerable courage in making it, for he must know that it will arouse opposition especially after his recent assurances to Parliament. He has already instructed his staff to prepare the plans. It is important that there should be no set-back to the energy of the Iraqi Government in its economic campaign and I therefore trust that if His Majesty's Government decide to reject the offer full credit will be given the Government for its willingness to go beyond the terms of the treaty and risk unpopularity.

While it seems only too probable that Jamali,-who has also been granted two months leave, may be an unconscionable time going, I like to think that his capacity for mischief while in Bagdad will be reduced when, in the near future, Tahsin Ali leaves the Ministry of Education for the Royal Diwan, and is succeeded by the present Minister for Foreign Affairs, Abdul Illah Hafidh. As regards Sami Shaukat, His Majesty's Ambassador at Cairo will be gratified at the cancellation of his intended appointment to that capital as Iraqi Minister, which aroused much opposition in the Cabinet here. 2. Sadek Cphar has arrived from Egypt and is at work in the Ministry of Ewcation in the capacity of’’Technical Adviser.” Professor Hamley - himself described as ’’Technical Expert” - is not satisfied with Sadek s nomenclature, since it denies the latter any executive powers; and accordingly the Professor is lobbying for his appointment as ’’Acting Director-General.” I agree that this is essential if Sadek is to achieve any constructive lasting improvements in the Ministry.

The Council of Ministers have agreed in principle to Professor Hamley s scheme of re-organisation and regulations are now being prepared with a view to beginning the good work of putting it into effect.

Bulk of the public is indifferent. In political circles little interest , has been shown. The majority think the step dictated by the British (we will do our best to correct this misapprehension). Some think it sound move by Iraq to declare for what now appears to be the winning side. Some consider it political manoeuvre by Nuri Pasha against his opponents, while others believe that tnere must be secret clause giving Iraq special advantages and wonder whether Persia could not make similar bargain. 2.

It would have been perfectly easy Lulic statement for him to have done so and also made a pu •in the same sense. t Furthermore, I said that I was very sorry to see that His Excellency., instead of grappling with these urgent and vital problems, was far too much inclined to allow his fancies to wander to other Arab countries. He Knew as well as I the harm which an excessive interest in Palestinian and Syrian questions had done to Iraq in the past. In wartime it was particularly dangerous with our enemies ready to make the most of possible discord. 5* ; The Prime Minister could not deny that the P 0 ! 1 ^ which had been adopted' might seem slightly earthy, but he maintained f Ijha^t there, was a great deal of enemy propaganda about-} arid that it was necessary to counter it' , ^ ssu £ e .the &gt;pe@ple&gt;that*-‘they would not be required to fight outside Iraq.

He intended to send me the letter for which I had asked; he* agreed that the British barley in tax cereals should oe ireed and that export licences should be granted.

Meanwhile, the possibilities will be examined by my staff. 10. As regards his external interests. His Excellency assured me that he had no intention of allowing Palestinian and Syrian questions to be ventilated in the press. Certain references to them had been inevitable when declaring war and informed public opinion was perturbed by Zionist campaign, but he did not want the public to become excited. He had sent a memorandum, oi which he had instructed that a copy should be sent to me, to Mr. Casey some days ago. He was having 500 copies printed for private circulation, but he did not intended to have it published. He asked me what I thought of it. I was beginning to dilate on a few of its more glaring imperfections when His Excellency glanced at^ his watch, exclaimed that he was over an hour late for^his appointment with the United States Minister. an excused himself. I will telegraph further on this subject as soon as possible.

When legislature reassembled on January 16th after recess, only some 44 deputies out of 115 took their seats and [? grp. omitted: ? it] was therefore a thin^house that applauded the Prime Minister’s announcement. High percentage of absentees may be attributed partly to normal post-holiday slackness and partly to the fact that reassembly of Parliament coincided with the ninth day of Muh&amp;rramwhich is strictly observed by all Shiah elements. Probably only in a very few cases did deputies keep away from motives of opposition to Nuri's policy. Little of note was'said in the few speeches that followed the announcement. Possibly the most interesting pronouncement was made by iibdul Wahab Mahmoud, deputy for Basra, who while welcoming particularly renewed interest of United States in international affairs, expressed his regret that no less than 120 elected representatives of the American people should have supported the idea of handing Palestine over to the Jews. Tewfik Suwaidi (who is in a most disgruntled mood, complaining that he has been insulted by the suggestion that he should serve abroad as a diplomatic representative under his dentist, present Minister for Foreign Affairs) enquired whether any assurances had been obtained limiting Iraq s commitments to her treaty obligations and was told by the Prime Minister that there would be a later opportunity to debate the vdiole question of Iraqi belligerency. Other speakers followed the general line of last week’s preparatory propaganda. 2. Public seems to have taken the news very calmly and I have not heard of any demonstrations either pro or con. Crowds listening to special broadcasts outside coffee ships seamed rather glum, but the weather was over-cast and there [? grp. ,omitted 2. was] even a rain v/hich always seems to depress the people. &lt;/?

Strictly Confidential. I feel that I should lose no time in making it clear that the Prime Minister despatched his reply to Mr. Churchill's admirable message without consulting me or any of my staff. In fact I have only just seen text of Nuri Pasha's discourse through the accident of circumstance that 'Judge' Lloyd who is now working as sort of adviser to the Prime Minister and Ministry for Foreign Affairs took the telegram to my P.R. Department for typing. On reading it I was at once struck by the untimely and tactless nature of its latter part and immediately contacted Prime Minister emphasising that in this solemn moment of Iraq's history His Excellency should have dwelt on what service this country can render to the United Nations, not on what she expects to receive at their hands. Unfortunately the cable had already been despatched and the Prime Minister could only observe somewhat lamely that this aspect had not occurred to him. Although he now agreed with me he had only had in mind what the Arabs would expect him to say. To this I replied that his action would not do Iraq any good. 2. The truth is that Nuri Pasha is thinking more and more of his pan-Arab ambitions and while I lose no ppportunity of counselling caution I fear that it may beccme increasingly difficult to keep him quiet especially if Zionist propaganda and activity continue on present scale with apparent approval of certain political elements in Great Britain and United States. I feel I should warn you in this connexion that the Prime Minister is contemplating addressing lengthy cominunication to Minister of State on Arab claims about which I will report further as soon as possible. 3. It is peculiarly regrettable that at this moment Nuri Pasha should have enlisted the personal services of 'Judge' Lloyd. This person who has attended Prime Minister during Palestine Conference in 1939 is bad influence and generally unreliable.

I share your confidence that victory is certain. I feel that after all the exertions that Great Britain and the United Nations have made up to the present what is left to be performed is less than what you have already achieved. We in Iraq are proud to have defeated all the sinister efforts of the Axis Powers to prevent us from taking our proper part in this conflict and in whatever remains to be done we are ready to do our share* We, Mr* Churchill, will never forget that it was your bold and far-seeing policy at the Cairo Conference of 1921 that laid the foundation for the full independence we have enjoyed for the past ten years- The Arabs of those countries which are not yet free are looking to you to secure for them the same independence that we in Iraq possess and so enable Great Britain to complete the great work she undertook over a quarter of a century ago to help the Arabs to obtain independence and unity. We are certain that you and President Roosevelt the authors of the Atlantic Charter will not fail to find a way for the United Nations to secure this for the Arabs.nts* , Under Soc5‘'eL-iry of S^ 4 *^ H. © 'f-ed - iOu, 0£f( f ^ 34 ^ for j ^ ^ U [This document must be paraphrased if communicated to any person outside Government Service] [This telegram is of particular secrecy and should he retained by the authorised recipient and not passed on] [CYPHER] WAR CABINET DISTRIBUTION FROM: IRAQ FRCM BAGDiiD TO FOREIGN OFFICE B. 1*20 p.m. 15th January, 1943.

While I agree that the declaration is bound to have considerable repercussions in the Middle East generally I doubt whether they will be uniformly favourable or necessarily advantageous to us. 2. Ibn Saud‘s reaction deserves particular attention in view of his value to us and of abortive negotiations tv/elve months ago for joint declaration of war by him and Iraq, It is essential that we should avoid giving any impression that we are conniving at the assumption by Nuri on behalf of Iraq of leadership of Arab countries. 3. The effect in Syria and Lebanon is likely to be good. In Egypt on the other hand declaration of war by Iraq may. give rise to anxieties; and, as in the case of Ibn Saud, we must avoid giving the Egyptian Government the impression that we are conniving in Iraqi leadership of the arab countries. Although from most points of view there is unlikely to be any strong desire in Egypt to follow immediately Iraq 1 s example in declaring war, the more so as Egypt has secured her place at the peace conference, it is not inconceivable that she might do .L- c-o so/2. sonie time (e.g, when bombing of Egypt no longer appears possible) with a view to enforcing her post war claims. . ^ or a bov&lt;j reasons i consider message the Prime Minister may decide to [grp. unde. ? address to] Nuri should be more general in character than that suggested by Sir K, Cornwallis and in particular should avoid any specific reference to Arabs and Loslemo v/hich in the uyes ox Xisia and other Middle Eastern countries would give rise to the belief that we are considering Iraq as the. picked leader of Arab world. 5* Beyond this I think our publicity handling of the event should be framed to meet comment or enquiries in other Middle Eastern countries which will probably take the following line; (a) Kas action been instigated by His Majesty’s Government? r If s ° vdiat is Iraq getting out of i/t if it can [92 groups undecypherable] Governments of Egypt, Levant States and Persia and Amir Abdullah should also receive advance information. ^ If it is the intention that exchange of notes with Iraq Government should be published, will Bagdad please arrange to circulate final texts to all Middle East posts?

Nuri was inclined to pooh-pooh this danger, but agreed that Air Officer Commanding should take such precautionary measures as might in the latter's view be necessary.

The Prime Minister is unfortunately hastening hut slowly in this matter although I have impressed its importance both on His Excellency and the Regent as well. However, Nuri Pasha told the Counsellor last night that he was laying his plans and in the circumstances I am instructing the Public Relations Attache to contact him directly to discuss the whole position and agree on how best to proceed. 2. It is essential to my mind that the initiative must come from the Iraqi side and the first step will be an oral campaign starting with the Prime Minister and his friends and carried on through the Director General of Propaganda. This would be amplified by articles in the vernacular press on the advantages etc. of whole-hearted participation in the struggle for Freedom etc. which our publicity organisation can quote, have broadcast, etc. Thus//•' ■ Thus we will always *be following the lead rather than setting the pace, emphasis throughout being on the fact that the decision, if taken, will be due entirely to the enterprise of the Iraqi Government themselves. /Copies sent to Mr.Armstrong./ -OUTWARD TELEGRAM [Copies sent to Mr. Armstrong]. v [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and should be kept under Lock and Key.] [This telegram is of particular secrecy and should t)e retained by the authorised recipient and not passed on] E. 7/103/93 [CYPHER] WAR GABUfET DISTRIBUTION TO: IRAQ.

Although Iraq’s belligerency is unlikely of itself to bring us any particular military or other advantage, the event is bound to have considerable significance and may well exert wide and lasting influence far beyond the confines of this country. For the first time in history an independent Moslem state entirely on its own free initiative has declared war as Ally of Great Britain thereby setting example to the whole Moslem and Arab world by coming down unequivocally on our side. This fact, it seems to me, will be of the greatest importance and I therefore venture to submit that when the moment arrives every effort should be made to extend warm and friendly welcome to this latest recruit to the United Nations. 2. I naturally do not suggest that the occasion should be marked by any political assurances or undertakings on the part of His Majesty^s Government, since we have already made it clear we have no quarrel with the cause of Arab unity. Between the United Kingdom and Iraq there is 'at present no direct bone of contention while so far as the natural anxieties of these people over the future of Palestine and Syria are concerned silence must be our only policy. What I would venture to advise, however, is that in the first place Mr. Churchill should address personal message to Nuri emphasising the historical importance LCypherJ WAR CABINET DISTRIBUTION FROM IRAQ FROM BAGDAD TO FOREIGN OFFICE v Sir K.

A message in the general sense of the foregoing would I believe be very well received’in all circles. Secondly I would suggest that some ceremony be arranged in London in honour of the Iraqi Charge d’Affaires at which suitable speeches could be made and that proceedings be well reported by Reuters, B.B.C., and the press.

I see no objection to attempting to secure some such public declaration of policy from the Prime Minister, and will proceed accordingly unless you instruct me to tne contrary. 2. Meanwhile in appreciating Nuri Pasha*s attitude I think.it important that the following considerations should be borne in mind, namely: (a) that since 1941 the Iragi Government have fully lived up to their treaty obligations and have indeed in certain respects exceeded them, so that it may be said with truth that their contribution to rhe war effort so far has not (repeat not) been inconsiderable. (b) everyone in this country is fully aware that Egypt, without any modification of her status as a non-belligerent ally, has received wide assurances of participation in the eventual peace talks. 3* Furthermore, while it is impossible at the moment to estimate exactly how the population here will welcome belligerency, it is certain that the country requires to be carefully prepared for this development. For this reason the Prime Minister will need to explain his policy in a manner calculated to enlist popular sympathy.. In doing so, he is unlikely to be very enthusiastic about making declarations that might be ill-received by those powerful elements who for their own political reasons and because the tide of war is apparently receding from the vicinity of Iraq, support Nuri Pasha s initiative, 4, I think it will be necessary for our publicity services to co-operate in campaign of preparation and on this point I am telegraphing separately as soon as possible.

O. o. % Mr. Eden.—(Received December l§.) l ^ 'mgiaWTWbvember 25, 1942. ^ THE reformed Cabinet, of which details were given in my despatch No. 2g3 of the 14th October last and with which Nun Said returnea to olhee on the 8th October, was soon found to contain discordant elements. Before a month had passed a violent quarrel broke out between the Minister of Communications, Abdul Mahdi, and the Minister of Education, Tahsin Ali. It is doubtful who was to blame for the insulting language which seems in the end to have been used by both Ministers in the altercation, but I suspect that it was very much a case oi the pot calling the kettle black. Peace-making efforts yielded no results, and each Minister insisted that after what had occurred it was impossible for him to remain in the Cabinet with the other. Friends and partisans rallied to each side, and, as one Minister is a Shia and the other a Sunni, the quarrel quickly developed into something of a sectarian tussle. For a few days it seemed that the Shia Minister of Finance, Salih Jabr, the most important of the Prime Minister’s collaborators, would become involved, but he showed good sense and courage enough to put country before faction and to stick to the task he had undertaken of finding a solution for Iraq’s economic difficulties. The Regent, too, had a personal interest in the matter and once again stood by his protege, Tahsin Ah. 2. To me it seemed deplorable that, at a time when there are so many urgent questions of public interest to be dealt with, a storm in the tea-cup like this should paralyse the administration, and I lost no opportunity of pressing the Regent and the Prime Minister (and the Minister of Finance) to have done with it quickly. Yet over a fortnight passed before all the moves in the tortuous game were played according to convention and a settlement could be leached. This was that both Abdul Mahdi and Tahsin Ali should leave the Cabinet, but that Tahsin Ali’s departure should be deferred until a place could be made for him at the Palace by sending the head of the Royal Diwan, Abbas Mahdi, to Tehran as Minister. Abdul Mahdi’s place was taken by Ahmad Mukhtar Baban, who was succeeded at the Ministry of social Affairs by a Shia, Abdul Razzaq Uzri, formerly a mutessarif. At the same time it was found necessary on account of his ill-health to accept the resignation of the aged and infirm Minister of Economics, Muhsin Shallash, and to appoint in his stead another Shia, Salman-al-Barrak, who for some years has been Deputy President of the Chamber. Peace was in this way restored in the Cabinet, but it is now a thing of makeshifts and patches and cannot be expected to last for more than a few months. 3. Parliament opened, as usual, on the 1st November. This will be the last session of the present Chamber, which, for the first time in Iraq’s parliamentary history, is living out its allotted span of four years. The Speech from the Throne was unduly concerned with Arab national ambitions and was disappointing in the paucity of its reference to current economic problems. 4. At the third meeting of the Chamber held on the 12th November a group of Deputies put forward a resolution asking the Government to secure the accession of Iraq to the Declaration of the United Nations made at Washington on the 1st January, 1942. The Prime Minister confessed to me afterwards that he had himself inspired this resolution because he thought that the time had now come for Iraq to take her place openly on the side of the Allies. He feels, no doubt, that, as Iraq is already contributing to the war effort of the United Nations all that is required to qualify her for inclusion in their ranks, she may as well take her place there properly and thereby gain the rights and privileges of full membership, including those set out in the Atlantic Charter. Nuri Pasha is convinced that such action on Iraq’s part would have a profound effect in all Near and Middle Eastern countries, and, indeed, among Arabs everywhere. Whether, in the event, Iraq’s belligerency will be greeted with joy by the mass of the people—whose pleasure over recent Allied victories was based to an appreciable extent upon the assumption that the danger of war was receding— remains to be seen. I personally think not. _ __ [36—54] ■ r-~rrrTT ..EPld2 5. More spontaneous interest is being shown by both Houses of Parliament in the question of the control and distribution of supplies and the fate of the political internees. At a meeting held on the 14th November, at which a number of speakers appealed to the Government to show clemency towards these victims of their political views, the Prime Minister stated that the Government had set up a committee to review the cases of individual internees and to classify them in three categories : those who could be set free immediately, those on whom thei restraint imposed could be lightened, and those who would have to be kept in internment until such time as they could be released without danger to the public interest. 6. The committee formed for this work is presided over by the adviser to the Ministry of the Interior and includes the (British) Technical Adviser to the Criminal Investigation Department and the Director-General of Police. Mr. Edmonds tells me that, though the committee may recommend the release of a few men interned as a punishment for petty political offences, such as abusive talk in public about the Allies or members of the Iraqi Government, they will not advocate the setting free of any of those who played an important part in anti- British or pro-Axis plotting or agitation. There may, indeed, be something to be said in favour of releasing the nonentities who have been interned for petty offences, and, if it were certain that the Government would not go beyond the committee’s recommendations, there would be little need for anxiety. I fear, however, that much pressure is being brought to bear on the Prime Minister to release not the unimportant but the influential and well-connected internees, and, although in the present state of public opinion such people would be far less dangerous than they were at the time of their internment, it is still, in my opinion, premature to release them. It may be true that the political atmosphere is now unfavourable for their activities, but they would find little difficulty in exploiting against ourselves and the present Iraqi regime the economic discontent to be found everywhere in the country, and might well endeavour to do so. 7. I have spoken firmly to the Prime Minister on the folly of yielding to pressure concerning these people, but I have the impression that he is now anxious to try to “ appease ” his opponents, and I think that he may also have in mind to rally the Nationalists ready for the post-war effort to get something substantial for the Arabs out of the peace. 8. Many Deputies have found occasion to speak about the seriousness of the supply difficulties and the high cost of living now prevailing in the country, but the Government have revealed no considered plan for dealing with these matters. The Minister of Finance is still in the process of studying the elements of his problems, and, though at times he shows courage and determination, at others, noticeably after discussions with the Prime Minister, he is hesitant and disinclined to act firmly. 9. In the meanwhile, he has done little to improve the general economic situation. So far as can be judged in the almost total absence of reliable figures, very little more wheat has been collected, no plan for the control of the sale, export or distribution of barley or rice has yet been adopted, and, apart from sugar, no rationing or other method of price-control of necessities of life has been brought into operation. The only measures that stand to the credit of the Administration are the prohibition of the export of barley and orders for the collection in kind of the land tax on wheat and rice in certain provinces. Fortunately, either because they have stocks of food or are earning wages high enough to compete with current prices, most of the people seem so far to be managing fairly well, and, apart from one or two minor and easily settled strikes, there has been no disorder caused by economic distress. It is nevertheless noticeable that communism is gaining adherents, particularly among educated young men. The strong appeal which its doctrines now make with their promise of easy panaceas for inequalities of wealth and all economic troubles is, of course, being reinforced by recent Russian military successes and by the strength which has been developed by democratic propaganda. If nazism is destroyed, communism will certainly be a considerable political force in this countrv after the Allied victory. It is, incidentally, being fanned by the sense of frustration induced among the more youthful of the politically-minded by their persistent inability to break into the charmed circle of public life, the entrances to which remain closely guarded by an ageing group of conservative politicians. 10. It has become a commonplace of current reports from Middle Eastern countries to refer to the profound effect made on public opinion by the victories of the Eighth Army, followed by the Anglo-American occupation of Morocco and Algiers. In Iraq the swing of the pendulum has been so marked that many people3 seem to think that the war is now all over bar the shouting, and to foster a more balanced appreciation of the facts our local propagandists have had to give up emphasising the good points in our war position and to stress instead the heavy fighting that still lies ahead before victory can be won. For the moment pro-Axis propaganda is silent, floored by the only sort of punch that can really hammer it: a brilliant Allied military success. , 11. Iraq’s external relations provide in these days little material for comment. Her neighbours are mostly absorbed in their internal affairs and the disturbing competition for influence of the representatives of the European Powers has, for the time being, been eliminated by the breaking off of diplomatic relations with Italy, France and Germany. The Prime Minister, however, like many other statesmen, tends to think of the present war as a sequel to the last and to feel that it is his duty somehow to find in it opportunities to carry on the struggle to create a united and independent Arabia, which was begun by King Hussain in June 1916. He also aims at improving Iraq’s international status by uniting in mutual alliance the countries already separately allied to Great Britain. His idea is to form a pro-democratic bloc comprising Iraq, the two other Middle Eastern allies of Great Britain, Egypt and Persia, and the mandated territories of Palestine, Transjordan and the Levant. He wishes to persuade Turkey to come into the bloc too. He regards the Treaty of Mutual Assistance signed at Angora in October 1939 between France, Great Britain and Turkey as establishing relations between Turkey and Great Britain analogous to the Anglo-Iraqi and Anglo-Egyptian Alliances, and realises, moreover, that the inclusion of Turkey in the pact would be the only thing to save it from insignificance. 12. The problem of finding a competent man to replace the discredited Drs. Sami Shawkat and Jamali at the head of the Department of Education is still unsolved. No suitable Egyptian officials are willing to undertake the task of reforming Iraqi education, and the Prime Minister remains opposed to what would seem to him to be so retrogressive a step as the appointment of an Englishman to do the work instead. Meantime, Dr. Jamali has sent a circular to all district directors of education urging them to take steps to implant a love of democratic virtues in the hearts of all school-children, and has been hotly attacked for his pains as a humbug by the Left-wing daily, The Voice of the People. 13. The Minister of State paid a visit to Iraq in the middle of October. He first went to Basra, and then, after a dash to Tehran by air, returned to Bagdad. His work was largely with the fighting forces, but the Iraqis were anxious to honour him, and he found time in his programme to attend a small dinner-party at the Palace and a banquet and reception given by the Government at the Town Hall. He also gave up an afternoon to meet the British residents at a garden- party given by the newly-formed British Community Council. The visit gave much pleasure to the large number of Iraqis with whom he made acquaintance, and his straight talks on the need to face up to current problems courageously were a most welcome reinforcement to my own efforts to bring responsible Iraqis to take a more realistic view of their present-day problems. 14. The large force of Polish troops with women’s ancillaries now in Iraq have been giving rise to special economic and other troubles. When they first camped in the neighbourhood of Khanaqin they descended like locusts on the small bazaar of the town and the unfortunate inhabitants were left almost without supplies. When the town was put out of bounds to Polish troops, contractors were employed to set up canteens in the camp and began to move large quantities of tinned foods, fresh fruit, meat, vegetables and all kinds of small manufactured articles from Bagdad to Khanaqin. On one occasion two lorries loaded with bread bought in Bagdad were intercepted on their way to the Polish camp. Prices at once rose sharply in Bagdad, as the hungry Poles were willing to pay any price for extra food or small articles of personal luxury, such as watches, socks, handkerchiefs, and so on, and a further serious dislocation of local trading was threatened. With the ready co-operation of the commander-in-chief and the Iraqi authorities, measures were, however, taken to check these inroads into the limited quantity of supplies and goods available for the general public, and the British army is now doing everything possible to supply the Poles with all they need. 15. Accidents due to careless or inefficient driving and intrusion into adjacent villages, with the concomitant complications over women, were other matters that have had to be dealt with. The Polish Commander, General Anders,4 has lately imposed severe penalties for offences of this kind, and I hope that the effect will be salutary. . 16. As matters stand, and in the absence of treaty relations between 1 oland and Iraq, Polish troops can only come to Iraq as part of the forces maintained by His Majesty’s Government under the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of Alliance, but the Polish Charge d’Affaires has shown a rather natural wish to take them under his own wing and to be the intermediary between them and the Iraqi Govei nment.^ Both the Prime Minister and myself have in consequence found it necessary to explain to him firmly that the Polish units now in Iraq are part of the British forces and must be treated as such for all official purposes. It has also been impressed upon M. Malhomme that in present circumstances too much publicity in an effort to popularise the Poles with the Iraqis would be unlikely to achieve the object desired. 17. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty s representatives at Angora, Cairo, Tehran, Jedda and Beirut; the Minister of State at Cairo; His Majesty’s High Commissioner for Palestine and Transjordan; the Governor- General of India; the Commander-in-chief, India; General Headquarters, Middle East; the Combined Middle East Intelligence Centre; the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; the Political Agent at Eoweit; and to His Majesty’s Consular Officers at Basra and Mosul.

THOMPSON.2. 5* In the above connexion, I referred to rumours about,—. the cancellation of army cloth, and indicated that if this occurred it would he resented hy His Majesty s Government [S^P* undec* ] I myself would regard It as utterly inexcusable. When the Minister of Finance replied plaintively that his sple object in seizing factories was to produce cheap clothing 1 or the poor and that this would be stultified if a large part of their available machinery had to work on the production of military - stores. I told him bluntly that he should have thought of.that h before, and furthermore that having failpd to do so, his proper course would be to explain his difficulties to the Commander-in- Chief at our coming meeting, with a view to^ascertaininguany modification of contracts could be made. His Excellency agreed to this, and undertook to study the matter in detail. I should add that in this part of our conversation I took the opportunity to explain the extent to which Jewish factories in Palestine are co-operating in the war effort. 4. Minister of Finance was,as always, thoroughly friendly, and promised to follow my advice.

My telegram No. 1216 paragraph 5. On December 14th and December 15th I discussed the twenVy-* C eight varied recommendations of the anti-inflat ion report at long meetings with the Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance and the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Counsellor, Commercial Secretary and the British adviser to the Ministry of Finance were also present. In due course I shall forward by bag some account of these long-winded and complex talks in the course of which I insisted upon covering every paragraph of the report instead of only those in the application of which some measure of British assistance would be necessary. 2, Meanwhile I feel you should know that although on Iraqi side much determined lip service was paid to the necessity for controlling prices etc. of cereals, there was too little indica tion of a determination to tackle ihe hard core of the problem, I fear, therefore, that such action as may be taken will be of a piece-meal nature. I got the impression very strongly, that so far as cereals are concerned there continues to be extreme reluctance to act against the farmers and this is confirmed by an ann9uncement today that growers will in the meantime be paid the official price at the farm. They will not be responsible for oost of transport, for which the Government will pay. This is of course equivalent to increasing price of wheat and represents another concession to agricultural vested interests whose influence over the present Cabinet seems all-powerful. 3. ^ Discussions also appeared to me to reveal a rather disturbing disposition on the part of the Prime Minister especial- ^9* ? valuable quid pro quo for any initiative to cope with the internal problems and an undue tendency to blame the army for the present difficulties, including rising prices and shortages in transport, spare parts and so on. The fact that P.A.I.C. are using through United Kingdom Commercial Corporation and private contractors, some 4Q&amp; of the commercial vehicles available in the country is certainly giving rise to criticism which is not so easy to answer, and the problem is clearly one that will call for care- ful handling. This is shown by the attitude adopted by Nuri Pasha during the meetings when ne argued that the Government must keep a closer check on all local purchases made by the army. He also made a somewhat pointed enquiry on December i5th as to the truth of a rumour that the military authorities proposed to hang /onm ' V ' ; ' ; '* ''' * Fit 1 { COPY u&lt;^' y^^yjJLn 1*I T3.

No. 1147 second paragraph), This^warning related not only to rOle ^ 'oTMPraqi army but also' id' facilities of many kinds granted to British forces. There was no indication that prime Minister imagined belligerency could influence in the least the factors outlined in following three paragraphs of this telegram and which militate against his tackling the economic problem. 2. Secondly as you will be aware perhaps main obstacle to effective action in economic sphere is reluctance of^leading politicians to offend powerful vested interests, agricultural mere entile, who are greatly benefitting irom the present . ilinflationary trend. It is to these elements that Prime Minister looks for help in fulfilment of his major political dreams. 3.

Iraq’s, belligerency Is unlikely to produce a v/ar mentality, \mile I am confident that the people' as a whole like all other nations would prefer to keep out, their present complacency will no doubt lead them to view participation as an academic gesture. To politicians it will'appear as means to an end, namely &lt; strengthening of their claims to British and American support in the settlement of the coming Arab demands. 5. ’I do not favour an attempt to bargain on lines suggested by Mr. Casey in hi£ Second‘paragraph because (a) I doubt whether Iraqis would agree to any such conditions which so far as I am aware have now been demanded in any other case and(b) even if they did there would be small possibility of their being able to live fully up to their assurances.

I told him that I was disappointed at the lack of progress which had been made and that bv its inaction the Iraqi Government was both storing up trouble for itself and failing to give the Allies the help which they expected, especially as Iraq was proposing to declare war on the .axis. It seemed to me that a new and most regrettable spirit of appeasement was growing up and that if it was not checked in the near future the Government would find itself in serious difficulties. There was far too much greed and selfishness about and, in particular, I had been shocked by the proposal that His Majesty*s Government should guarantee the purchase of surplus barley for 5 years at high price. His Excellency, as late Minister of the Interior, must know perfectly well that if firmness were shown the present crop could De extracted without any guarantee for the future. While I could not say what the attitude of His Majesty’s Government would be, I must tell him frankly that I could not advise its acceptance. The Minister.said hastily that, in that case, he would ask the Prime Minister to'withdraw it and he admitted that when Nuri Pasha had suggested that the Iraqi Government should give such a guarantee he had flatly refused. 2. The Minister explained some of his difficulties to me. He maintained that he is in favour of strong action (and I think his record bears this out) but that he is handicapped partly by the poorness of the administrative machine and partly by the attitude of the Prime Minister and most of his other colleagues.who are far too inclined to let things slide. 3. He claimed however that the Government was not being entirely inactive. For instance higher supply committee had yesterday decided to keep wheat at its present price and to obtain Government requirements if necessary by force. When I said this was the policy decided months ago, he replied that v l 19-42 I • •.«2. I was unaware of the strenuous efforts which were being made to raise the official price* 4 He said he was impatiently awaiting the . arrival of transport expert (see my telegram) ana that he was about to ask for two more experts, one to control spare parts for motipr vehicles ana the other to control spare parts for agricultural pump engine . c He said the Cabinet is considering^anti inflation report tomorrow and that the Prime l^inis tor and he wish to discuss it with me the following day. 6 He cited some other instances to prove his ooint and promised that export licence for 8 , 5 uU tons of barley and 8“,500 of millet, for which we have just asked, would be-forthcoming m a lew days 17 j said I was glad to hear he was in favour ,'esf more energetic policy but thatro real progress was likely until a maximum price had been fixed lor che chief cereals, an effective organisation^to ensure collection in due course and drastic punishment metea out to certain prominent people who were know... to be opposing all [grp* undeo. ? concerned] action* «.

Views expressed in above will be communicated to the Prime Minister in support of my recent representations at the earliest opportunity. I must confess that I find his whole attitude on the supply problem very disappointing. He appears to be affected by an extreme reluctance to risk offending any powerful interests, as well as by desire to extract valuable quid pro quo for co-operation, such as export of [grp. unde. ? barley] to [? Limitrophe] countries whose need to benefit from Iraq’s large surplus is acute. It is only fair to add that he is under considerable pressure of course from those who contend that now is the time to secure good bargains. 2. As regards internee problem I fear the existence of committee far outweighs possible adverse effect on prestige of its members should their advice be overruled. [Grp. unde. ? Spence] Edmonds and Company will at least act as a creak and^ up te date have shown no disposition to acquiesce in release ol any important agitators. Naturally however I cannot guarantee that their recommendations in any given case will not^be exceeded. But as against this it seems likely if committee has. not been appointed Prime Minister in his present mood might have already acted rashly. So far as smaller personalities are concerned, and whilb I consider leniency premature, present satisfactory state of internal security makes it hard to contest^ the view that there is a case for revision of sentences in certain cases. As already reported, however, I have urged committee to proceed cautiously. 3. To some extent our own propaganda is to blame for recent growth of complacency here, for it has over-emphasised immediate possibilities of recent successes. It is a^great pity to my mind that a note almost of hysteria seems so easily to upset our^ publicity, especially that of B.B.G. which is listened to with avidity by the Prime Minister and others. Both the Prime Minister and Minister of Finance have for example referred joyfully^to the probable easing of supply position through early opening of the Mediterranean.

(E 6850/204/93) (ThiSf,telegram is of particular secrecy and should be retained -jr by the authorised recipient and not passed on) I am much disturbed by your account of the Prime Minister’s attit de. If unnecessary suffering and discontent are to be avoided the Iraqi Government must take vigorous action to deal with the various argent economic problems awaiting a solution. I had hoped that new spirit of confidence arising from our victories in North Africa would not encourage a man of Nuri’s experience to act as if the war was as good as over but, on the contrary, that opportunity would be seized by him for tackling these problems seriously. .You may let him know that His Majesty’s Government look to him in this matter and may like to draw his attention personally to what Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said on this subject on v/inding up the debate on the Address on the 12th November (text telegraphed to Minister of State). Even from his own point of view N(uri) should realise that these economic prob^U^ms will not vanish the moment the war is over and that his ambitions will require that there should not be economic and financial chaos in his own country. 2. I am also strongly opposed to any slackening in the measures taken against hostile elements in Iraq. The release of even a few of the internees will inevitably encourage the friends of the rest to put increasing pressure on the Iraqi Government to release them too, and these people can be counted upon to make trouble for the Iraqi Government and ourselves at the first favourable opportunity. 3. I am moreover doubtful of t:. wisdom of associating British officials too closely with responsibility for refusing the release of any internees unless greater attention than in the past is paid to their viev/s as to who should be interned. If as I understand some of the worst offenders have been saved from internment by friends in high places Adviser in the Ministry of the lnte*ior etc. might surely be placed in very difficult position when considering appeals from less dangerous among the internees. I should be glad of your views on this. (Copies sent to Mr. Armstrong.)

On November 16th in the Senate Subih Daftari urged the Government to modify their internment policy and to release political prisoners from Amarah camp. His appeal led to forceful reply from the Minister of Finance who in assuming full responsibility for the detentions, made while he was Minister of the Interior, declared then to be fully justified. 2, The attitude of the Prime Minister is not however so firm. He has told me that he favours releasing number of detainees and allowing them to live “somewhere in the south' with the obligation to report periodically to the police. To this end he has appointed committee consisting of British adviser to the Minister of the Interior, British head of C.I.D. and[grp.undec.?

' 4, Unfortunately His Excellency is in “appeasing' mood and anxious from all I hear, to “make friends 1 as widely as possible.

Be this as it may his present attitude is regrettable because it suggests that he is unlikely to^ support the Minister of Finance in strong measures against hoarders, speculators and profiteers, the need for wnich Saleh Jabr is now coming to realise.

M — ‘ IN h is despatch No. 2 07 of the 2nd August, His Majesty’s Ambassador described the signs which suggested that the Cabinet might soon reach the end ot its allotted span of life. The Minister of Finance was at odds with the Minister of the Interior and the two “-Shia Ministers were embarrassing their chiet with demands for the appointment of another Minister of their sect. The truce which was then accepted by the discordant elements was intended to last until the end of August and, in the event, the Cabinet survived this period by only little over a month. 1 . . t 2. The Prime Minister began with the hope that before Parliament assembled in November he might be able to deal with the situation b\ making peace between the Ministers of Finance and Interior, adding a third Ahia to his team and making a few minor changes among the other members. He soon found, however, that, although the Minister of Finance had been m Istanbul during most of August and September, his absence had done little to heal his quarrel with the Minister of the Interior, and soon after returning Ali Mumtaz was once more at loggerheads with Salih Jabr over the difficult mattei of the collection and distribution of wheat. He accused Salih Jabr of wilful obstruc tions, and Salih Jabr retorted by charging him with dishonest speculation and corruption. Nuri Pasha’s hopes of an easy settlement of his Cabinet troubles thereupon vanished and. realising that half-measures would be of no avail, he tendered his resignation to the Regent on the 3rd October. 3. He was at once invited to form a new Cabinet, and having already made his plans he embarked on this task with confidence. He had decided (after con siderable consultation with this embassy, in the course of which we had con sistently emphasised the necessity for a strong personality at the Ministry of Finance) that Salih Jabr must be retained and that Ali Mumtaz would m con- seQuence have to go. He hoped to persuade Taufiq Suwaidi to accept the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and help him to bear the burden of the parliamentary work which he had found so exhausting during the last session, and he had an eye on two or three suitable men to complete the required Shia quota. He wanted to replace Tahsin Ali at Education by Amin Zaki, to move Salih Jabr to Finance to grapple with Iraq’s economic and supply difficulties and to put Abdul Azziz-al- Qassab into Interior in his stead. The other Ministers, excepting perhaps Jamal Baban, he meant to keep. 4. Unfortunately, his luck seemed to be out. Taufiq Suwaidi, with an irresponsibility that shakes one’s confidence in him, made impossible demands. He wanted most of the old Ministers, including Salih Jabr and Abdul Mahdi, to be dropped and to introduce men such as Umar Nazmi and Mustafa-al-Umari, with whom Nuri Pasha knew that it would be impossible for him to work in harmony. Furthermore, he was dissatisfied with the offer of the Ministry for . Foreign Affairs unless he could also have the title of Deputy Prime Minister (for which there is no constitutional provision) and asked for either Interior or Finance for himself. He spoke in disparaging terms of the late Government’s policy of close co-operation with His Majesty’s Government and declared that Nuri Pasha was retaining Salih Jabr only because the British had told him to do so. 5. In these circumstances, Nuri Pasha had no alternative but to give up the idea of including the “ Red Fox ” in the new Cabinet. Nor did the rest of the Prime Minister’s plan work out smoothly. Abdul Azziz-al-Qassab and Amin Zaki both declined office (fortunately, in my view) on account of their poor health, and Tahsin Ali was unexpectedly ^ protected by the Regent, who, for personal reasons which I have not yet fathomed, pressed for his retention. In consequence [rEGd. POL.&gt; ^•S of these set-backs, the Prime Minister was obliged to modify his original inten tions and it was not until the 5th October that he completed his new Cabinet in the following manner :•—■ Prime Minister and Minister for Defence : Nuri Said. ' / &gt; « . Foreign Affairs: Abdul Illah Hefidh. Interior : Tahsin-al-Askari. ^ i &gt; Finance: Salih Jabr. ' . Justice: Daud-al-Haidari. Communications and Works : Abdul Mahdi. Education : Tahsin Ali. Economics : Abdul Muhsin-al-Shallash. Social Affairs : Ahmad Mukhtar Baban. As you will see, there is no fundamental change in the Cabinet except for the dropping of Ali Mumtaz, and six of the late Ministers return to office. Abdul Muhsin-al-Shallash (the third “ Shia ”) has been a Minister of Finance in former Cabinets, and Ahmad Mukhtar Baban, a civil servant, whose last post was Director-General of Supplies, passes as a Kurd in virtue of his membership of the Baban family. 6. The Cabinet has lost vigour by the departure of Ali Mumtaz, and without Taufiq Suwaidi it will, as Nuri Pasha himself foresees, be weak in debate. In political circles it is expected that Taufiq Suwaidi will now join the ranks of those opposed to the Prime Minister and that in the Senate there will be strong criticism of his administration by a compact, hostile group including Jamil Madfai and Mustafa-al-Umari. On the other hand, it is doubtful whether these men wish to assume the responsibility of governing the country in the present difficult circumstances, and they may, therefore, be shy of pressing home their attacks. 7. In a public statement which he made on returning to office the Prime Minister declared that the programme of the new Cabinet would remain unchanged, and that he and his colleagues would devote their attention especially to improving the distribution of essential supplies and the reform of public education. He is without doubt right to give first importance to supplies. 8. The Government’s plans for building up stocks of wheat with which to feed the urban population have not yet produced the results hoped for. The supplies needed for the bakeries and for the sale of flour in small quantities at a controlled price have up to the present been maintained in most places, but of the reserve stock of 100,000 tons which it was estimated would be needed to meet the demands of the towns until next harvest only about 40,000 tons have so far been collected. The policy of compelling the owners of large stocks of wheat to sell to the Government at the fixed prices has, however, only been in operation for a little over a month and on the information available it is not unreasonable to hope that, as each month passes, further quantities will be located, bought up and distributed fast enough to keep pace with current consumption. 9. A similar handling of a number of other essentials of life will, however, be necessary if the great mass of the townspeople are to be saved from severe hardship during the coming winter. For a variety of reasons, which it is unnecessary to discuss in this despatch, the prices of all food-stuffs and con sumers' goods, including many things of which there is no real shortage, have been rising rapidly and the wage-earning classes are facing the oncoming winter with acute anxiety. In consequence, on all sides demands are being pressed for substantial wage increases, and unless urgent measures are taken to peg down market prices or to ensure rationed supplies of cheap food and clothing we shall soon, I fear, see wages vainly mounting in pursuit of prices until inflation and economic chaos result. 10 Compared with the complex systems of the industrialised countries of Europe, the national economy of Iraq is simple, but the fact has to be faced that the administrative machine is woefully inadequate to deal with current problems even in the elementary form in which they occur in this country. The small group of British officials who are trying to establish a working control over supplies are now, however, beginning to make some slight headway, and I try to hope that before winter comes the position may have been improved. It is, nevertheless, clear that the feeding, clothing and housing of the people is the most urgent and important problem that the Government have to face, and I would that I could detect some real evidence of a robust determination to tackle these problems. Instead, one has to fight against inertia, lack of public spirit and widespread stupidity on the part of politicians, vested interests and the propertied classes. h r3 11. Hostile war propaganda is now at a low ebb and confidence in an Allied victory steady. Two important factors influencing public opinion were, first, the stories brought back by Iraqi visitors to Turkey that well-informed lurks were convinced of German defeat and, secondly, Stalingrad s stubborn defence in face of Germany’s reckless attacks. 12. In tribal affairs the Shammar have been attracting more than usual ;J^ution during the last two months. I he late Sheikh AjiTal-Yai wai built up great wealth through his astute exploitation of the opportunities offered to him by the development of oil-fields in the Northern Jezirah and by the constiuction of the broad-gauge railway through the Shammar (lira. He also cultivated influential friends in high places and through them acquired much land. This was given to him in order that he might settle his tribe and persuade them to gAo up their old habits of marauding. What he did, however, was to farm the land for his own profit with hired labour without attempting to settle the Bedoum Shammar. His son Sufuk, who succeeded him after his death not long ago, has not, unhappily, the same strong hold over the tribe as his father and rival scions of the numerous shaikhly house are now competing with him jealously for a share in his inherited wealth and influence. Of these the Aulad Faisal are the most forceful and one of their most troublesome activities has been their persistent blackmailing of the Iraqi Government and British army contractors. Their practice is to demand large sums from all contractors working in the Shammar dira on the pretext of providing local ‘‘ protection ’ for the work, towards the end of Alm ost a quarrel flared up between three shaikhs of the Aulad Faisal and a shaikh of another branch of the shaikhly family as to who should enjoy the right of extorting monev in this manner from British army contractors work ing on certain sectors of the Mosul-Tel Kotchek Road, and a fight followed m which one of the Aulad Faisal and a number of the followers on each side were killed. The forces engaged were so large and well-armed that the Iraqi police in a nearby post were afraid to intervene and the contractors in the neighbour hood were so unnerved that they stopped work and for some time refused to go back to this part of the road. Owing to a lack of proper understanding between the Mutasarrif at Mosul and the Minister of the Interior an unduly Ion- delay occurred before this affair was dealt with, and it was not until the 2nd October that the principal participants were brought into Mosul and locked up. ^o soon as this was done the contractors were able to resume work, but further disciplinary measures will have to be taken before the unruliness of the Shammar is satis factory y QQO'nate quarrel of the Shammar with the Yezidi shaikh Daud-i- Daud has not yet been fully settled by the Iraqi Government, and peace between the two tribes is only preserved by detaining Daud-i-Daud m Sulaimam . an arrangement that cannot be prolonged indefinitely. , 14 Dohuk and Armadiyah have not yet been altogether freed from the marauding bands which have intimidated the villagers for so long. On the 25th August fifteen men raided the Assyrian village of Barzangi m the Armadiyah district, brutally murdered a priest and looted his house. Only one arrest has so far been made for this crime, but about forty men are now awaiting trial for other outrages committed by these gangs. , 15. During the latter part of the summer the Diwamyah hwa was the scene of a number of tribal conflicts, the worst of which took place on the 9th September, when* atody 0 of men of the Aqra tribe attacked five of the Khazad and, hav,ng Wiled them all, mutilated their bodies. Police intervention stopped the spread of the fighting, but the temper of both tribes remains hot and their future action uncertain Their quarrel, like so many on the Euphrates, is an old one, and the Wa state that their treatment of the Khazail dead was retaliation for a similar outrage committed by Khazailis on Aqra men five years ago. These disturbances have no major political significance, but they show how wild and brutish the greater part of the population still is, and give sinister point to the reports which I receive of the large number of rifles and cartridges which the tribes in all parts of the country have secured for themselves during recent years. 16 On the night of the 29-30th August the railway line near Hillah was blown up by a percussion bomb of some kind as a tram was passing Little damage was done, and no casualties were caused. Those responsible have not yet been traced, and it has not yet been established what type of bomb or mine had been placed under the track. . . „ . , ,, •. 17. In late September there was a serious outbreak ot agrarian trouble m the Hai in the Kut liwa. Men of the A1 Aid tribe raided sheep belonging to a neighbouring Sadun landlord who had refused them permission to pass a canalV 4 through his land to the river. When he and a relative went with two policemen to recover the sheep the tribesmen ambushed and killed most of the party. The tribal leaders rejected a twenty-four hours’ ultimatum to submit, but in a fight with the police that followed the tribesmen were dispersed and are thought to have lost about eighty men killed and seriously wounded. The police casualties were eight men killed and twenty-five wounded. 18. The Regent went to Amman on the 31st August to visit his uncle, Amir Abdullah, and remained until the 8th September. During his absence a Council of Regency exercised the Royal prerogatives on his behalf. The members were Muhammad-al-Sadr, President of the Senate; Hamdi-al-Pachachi, the President of the Chamber of Deputies; and Jamil Madfai Senator and former Prime Minister. 19. The Prime Minister's efforts to obtain a suitable Egyptian educa tionalist to undertake the task of putting through urgently-needed reforms, both in the Ministry of Education and in the whole system of public instruction, have, unhappily, not yet borne fruit. On the 10th October he flew to Cairo with Professor Hamley to make a direct personal appeal to the Egyptian Government to release Professor Gourbal for a year or, failing him, some other suitable senior official from the Egyptian Education Service. A new term has already begun, and the desired changes must be made soon if they are to have any influence on the current year’s work of the colleges and schools. 20. The Regent and the Prime Minister were both much disappointed and a little hurt that Mr. Churchill was unable to stop a while in Iraq during the course of his visit to the Middle East in August. Their feelings were eventually assuaged by the encouraging personal message which Mr. Churchill sent to Nuri Pasha on returning to London. 21. Mr. Wendell Willkie visited Iraq in the middle of September as the personal representative of the President of the United States. His stay of two days in Bagdad was filled with a heavy programme, which he worked through with successful vigour and aplomb. He seems to have convinced most Iraqis whom he met that America is now whole-heartedly in the war, and determined to win. Mr. T. Murray Wilson, the newly-appointed Minister Resident of the United States, presented his letters of credence to the Regent on the 26th September. I have not yet had occasion to meet him more than a few times, but my impression is that he wishes to be friendly and helpful. 22. The Saudi Arabian Government have informed the Iraqi Government that they can accept no responsibility for any convoys that may attempt to make the overland journey for the Haj on the Darb Zubaida, which the Iraqis insisted on using last year, and have added that even the alternative route from Zubair through Hafar should only be used by vehicles which the Iraqi authorities are satisfied are fitted for the long journey to Mecca. Motor transport and tyres are becoming scarce, and most serviceable vehicles are profitably engaged on war or other work. The overland pilgrimage from Iraq is therefore likely to be very small this year. 23. There have been no events on the Perso-Iraqi frontier since Sir Kinahan Cornwallis’s last general despatch at the beginning of August, and most of the Kurdish tribes on the Persian side of the border now seem to have established some kind of modus vivendi with the Persian authorities. 24. The Turkish Government have not yet agreed to extradite Salah-ud- Din Sabbagh, the fugitive Iraqi rebel general, and there is now little prospect of their being persuaded to do so. 25. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s representatives at Angora, Cairo, Tehran, Jeddah and Beirut, the Minister of State at Cairo, His Majesty’s High Commissioner for Palestine and Transjordan, the Governor- General of India, the Commander-in-Chief, India, General Headquarters, Middle East, the Middle East Intelligence Centre, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, the Political Agent, Ivoweit, and to His Majesty’s Consular Officers at Basra and Mosul.

Nuri Pasha went on to explain that direct Iraq participation in the war would not alter do facto situation since it would not be possible for this country to contribute more than it is doing already.

As mpatience over persistent deadlock in the Cabinet is now rapidly growing and might very soon lead to resignations of Ministers not directly concerned. I have informed the Prime Minister that unless an immediate solution can be found through the departure of Abdul Mahdi and Tabs in Ali we may be confronted with the downfall of the Government which would react adversely upon British and Iraqi interests. I have asked him to represent these views to the Regent. 2. It is difficult to understand Nuri Pasha's hesitations over this issue but, whatever their cause, they are certainly doing him harm. The Minister of Justice called this morning and expressed his concern over the situation. He hinted that the Prime Minister was n tlred fi (actually he is looking extremely well). In the course of a long and frank conversation I took the line that a major crisis was to bo avoided at the present time when it is so important for the Minister of Finance to tackle the economic problem which daily grows more acute. 3. I have the impression from Baud's observations and from what I hear from other sources that if the administration should collapse Nuri Pasha might not find it easy to form another Cabinet. If the resulting confusion led to nothing worse it would inevitably entail further useless bickering and lack of confidence. So, I feel, in the hope of ensuring some breathing space - if only a month or two - there is every advantage in pressing both the Prime Minister and the Regent to grasp the nettle of ridding themselves of both Ministers of Education and Communications.

Speech from the Throne at Opening of Parliament on November 1st opened with congratulations to Deputies on having reached their fourth consecutive session without a dissolution. War situation was then reviewed and grounds for optimism found in recent addition to ranks of Allied Nations, the decreased chances of the spread of the war from Europe further eastwards and the growing strength of the democratic powers. 2. The foreign policy of the Government would it was stated continue unchanged based on good relations with Iraq’s neighbours # the development or closer ties with kindred Arab States and the fulfilment of the Anglo-Iraqi Alliance. Its aim would also be the realisation of the desires of the Arab States v/hose achievement of independence had been delayed and to whom satisfaction had been # assured in the undertakings given by the British Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs* The occasion of the visit of Mr. V/endell Willkie had been taken to explain the Arab question to him and to impress on him the necessity for modifying the claims to special rights and privileges in Arab countries put forward by certain States wherever such claims were in conflict with recent world developments. 3.

Discussion increased common knowledge of difficulties and strengthened mutual understanding between Provinces and Headquarters. I have no full report on recommendations of the conference but I gather that these include collection in kind instead of in cash of tithes levied on grain crops and compulsory sale to the Govern ment of a proportion (i or l/3rd) of all grain put on the market. Conference also advised closer control of available motor transport.pointtig out that in the provinces not served by the railway cost of lorries added enormously to the cost of grain (e.g. dinars 25 to move A tons from Kirkuk to Sulaimani and dinars 80 from Ramadi to Ana). These recommendations are now before the Minister of Finance who is being urged by adviser to take urgent decisions. Grain proposals if adopted should keep the pot boiling but are unlikely in themselves to provide all that is needed and further commandeering might have to follow* 2.

Repeated to SAinister of State Cairo No. 514. My telegram No . 1078 . I have now discussed the position with the British advisers to the Ministries of Finance and the Interior. While far from being optimistic about this experience /sic. ?experiment/ they feel, and I agree, that our only policy is to watch it put /?grp. omtd. ?into/ effect and see how it works. It would be a great mistake to risk forcing a Cabinet crisis on such an issue. It would be far preferable, we all consider, to be ready to help constructively if as is to be feared, the Minister of Finance fails to find the Iraqis capable or willing to function effectively in the new posts he has created. While we must abandon at any rate for the moment our recent aim of an all-British Directorate-General of Supply with executive powers, we should not lose sight of the Minister of Finance’s undertaking to apply if necessary for the help of the British experts in an advisory capacity. The control of transport and the possible introduction of rationing are likely to be two of the most complex problems to be handled and I therefore recommend that preliminary enquiries should be made to find suitable candidates who, if the occasion arose, could be sent out at short notice. In /?grp. omtd. ?this7 event, I would advise against any/any haggling over terms. The Minister oi' state in his recent personal message to Nuri Pasha offered possible collaboration in furnishing personnel and it might he vvell worth while to he responsible ourselves for the experts remuneration. As regards transport, Mr. Sinclair of the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation who is leaving today for the United Kingdom has drawn up a report for the Government. He states that there should be no difficulty in finding someone in England - perhaps London Passenger Transport Board - with the required qualifications. 2. No one here regrets the dropping of Mr. Lloyd who achieved nothing in dealing with grains and who was loyal neither to the Iraqis nor to ourselves. Nurredin, an Iraqi who was concerned with transport questions and who proved a iailure in handling tyres, has also disappeared. We had been waiting for this for some 3. Meanwhile, and as the situation develops I would utter a warning against the guib advice of those who at tnis juncture favour 'strong British Government intervention'. For example a Mr. Brabazon Jones of the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation arrived here recently and is inclined to be vocal on this theme. He feels that last summer the Iraqi Government should have been 'compelled to store grain etc. but when asked how he would have applied 'compulsion' remained mute. There is too much of such loose jabbering by irresponsibles. /Copies sent to Mr. Armstrong*mpflmante tlfK* indef* Secretary ?or Foreign Affaire St at# !X PvJUfcJL^ t I Sc^ldj^ HOV 1942 (This telegram is of particular secrecy and should l^e.Retained t&gt;y tj^e authorised recipient and not passed on* J •mmMM [Cypher. ] * AMEN DED COPY .* W AR C ABD'g^ DISTRI BUTI ON. .

Repeated to Minister of State No. 510. 999999999 . , IMPORTANT My immediately preceding telegram. When I arrived at Nuri Pasha’s office, Minister of Finance was just leaving and former admitted that he had just been hearing about my previous interview. After [grp. undec.] skating rapidly over much ground already covered by Minister of Finance and confirming that Council of Ministers had approved the new policy, Prime Minister emphasised that none appreciated better than he the necessity for close co-operation with the British and United States authorities. Furthermore he quite realised that if mistakes were made Iraq would have to meet the consequences. It was with this knowledge that he had agreed to SalCK,. Jab^.. , s proposals, a fact v/hich would illustrate the confidence he reposed in them. He repeated.the views • previously expressed in [sic ? by] me about Husam Udin Juma (My_ tele gram 1062 ) and assured me that whatever happened to Mr. Lloyd, Major Page would remain. He had given instructions that there should be no backwardness in filling the posts of Directors-General. He expressed the-personal opinion that Minister of Finance would not (repeat not) be able, when it came to the point, to find suitable Iraqis for this purpose and he added that, had he been Hus&amp;wt, he would never have accepted the invitation to be DirectorHleneral. The long and short of it was that if plan did not work out in practice it would have to be modified. 2. As Nuri Pasha was due to lunch with the Regent, I could not prolong the interview unduly. In any event it appeared useless to argue indefinitely as we are apparently confronted with a temperament which nothing short of a Cabinet crisis seems likely to alter. I got very strong impression that the Prime Minister had been unable to hold the Minister of Finance and had finally decided to give him his head and so perhaps let him learn by experience. He is evidently having trouble in the Cabinet/• , 2** Cabinet, for he mentioned that- the ianfrsters of Communication r' and Education had had a serious quarrel yesterday and that the former would resign to-morrow if it could not be patched up. However I told the Prime Minister that the situation worried me, and that apart from any other consideration I was far from certain this experiment would meet with approval in the country. The United States and ourselves were interested mainly in three things namely (a) that people should be fed (b) that Iraq with her grain surplus should assist neighbouring countries (c) that imports should be effectively controlled and honestly distributed, I would do my very best to report objectively explanations given to me but I would not conceal from him that they were unlikely to be received with acclamation, 3. I shall discuss the whole position with the British Advisor as soon as possible. In the meantime my first reaction,is that while we can take certain precautions (e,g. tyres due at Basra at any moment will be held under Military control) until the position clarifies, the moment is not ripe [grp, undec.] threaten non supply of essential commodities or anything of that kind. Since hay 191-1 we have followed with success a policy of patient co-operation with these people in strict accordance with the treaty and I feel v/e should ponder long and seriously before we even contemplate the possibility of modifying it. We must see first how the position develops. ,' [Copies sent to Mr. Armstrong.) ''* -t,Sl [THIS TELEGRAM IS OF PARTICULAR SECRECY AND SHOULD BE RETAINED BY 1 AUTHORISED RECIPIENT u\ND NOT PASSED ON].

IM PORTANT . &amp; 6 cj • 53^3 My telegram Nos. 988 and 992 paragraph 5 . Mjrt^ssarif of Bagdad has now been dismissed and replaced by Husain Uddm Juma whose appointment however will not be confirmed until he has served a period of probation. „ 2* y° u may recall, this individual was Director General of the Police at the time of the 1941 rebellion and was later Mutessarif of Mosul in which capacity he proved a failure. He is unreliable to say the least and is primarily concerned with being all things to all men. His selection was sprung upon us and there was no opportunity to advise the Prime Minister against it but I shall speak to Nuri Pasha at the first opportunity. , Although it is too soon to express any final opinion about the new &lt; administration, I have the impression that from the Prime Minister down they have at least realised that the economic problem is serious, Y/hether this realisation will be translated into energetic action remains to be seen. Energy alone will not however solve their economic uiiiiculties and indeed it may do far more harm than good unless it is wisely employed in carrying out a policy based on sound principles. Such a plan is not easily conceived for there are, as many realise, more imponderables in economic problems in Iraq than in other countries. Nven the British officials concerned sh own in the Mafia meeting presided over by the Minister oi State on October 18th) often disagree about what should be done and we have no higher expert authority to resolve their differences. 5. It is nevertheless satisfactory that all Mutessarifs have been summoned to_Bagdad for consultation on the question of collection and distribution of wheat and barley and a workable plan may result. As regards inflation, a committee has made certain recommendations to the Government embodying suggestions agreed upon at the recent Cairo conference [grp. undec. ?and] in short there are welcome signs that, in contrast to last summer.

( While the above was being despatched the Prime Minister called to say that this morning the Minister of the Interior had told him definitely he could no longer work with Minister of Finance. Consequently he, Nuri Pasha, was faped with the necessity of re-shuffling the Cabinet as outlined m my telegram No. 973 paragraph 2.. The Regent f had agreed generally with his proposals except that His Royal Highness had demurred over having Abdul Azziz as Minister of the Interior preferring that the latter should go to Finance. Before deciding finally however the Regent wished to know what His Majesty s Ambassador felt and had asked the Prime Minister to see His Sxcellency. 2 .

This has led the doctors (including the consultant, Colonel Lipscombe) to cut^down drastically on visitors and talk. So I told the Prime Minister I would take the responsibility of answering the Regent’s question. 3. In the discussion that ensued I told Nuri Pasha^ that while I was not enthusiastic about having Abdul Azziz as Minister of the Interior, I disliked very much the idea of his being Minister of Finance. He is an^elderly politician and according to my information finicky and bad about taking decisions. Moreover he does not know English, a sad handicap in dealing with British experts on supply problems. Finally the work would be entirely_new to him and its growing complexity would lead to inordinate delays. If he was in the Cabinet he would be more at ease as Minister of the Interior (a part he has already occupied I think five times) a lway s prov ided he gave assurances to abide by the Government 1 s policy and not on sentimental or other grounds let out undesirables now m Amarih concentration camp. 4. The Prime Minister expressed his agreement with these views and undertook to represent them to the Regent. If His Royal Highness agreed he would offer the Ministry of the Interior to Azziz in return for assurances, but say nothing about Finance which would go to Saleh Jabr. He also agreed that if Azziz refused (which I rather hope he will and I believe Nuri Pasha does too) then Saleh Jabr would remain Minister of the Interior while Finance would be offered to Abdul Illah Hafiz now Minister of Economics REC».

This row coincided with the return from a provincial tour of Mr. Lloyd, director-general of grains, who is bitter in his denunciations of Mutessarife in general for their widespread failure to compel growers to disgorge. You will appreciate that all this has given a powerful impetus to the accusations against the Minister of the Interior of supposed “non-co-operation” in making the Government grain policies effective. He is being attacked inter alia for intriguing between Shiahs against Minister or Finance. 3. British adviser to the Ministry of the Interior is doing his best to calm both protagonists down and taking steps to a solution. He does not believe there has been any deliberate [grp. undec. ]ing on either side but his task is hampered by introduction of personalities into the debate. It is unfortunate that the tempers of certain British officials (notably the voluble Lloyd) are also ruffled and I have asked the adviser to the Ministry of Finance to use his influence to soothe the latter especially.

Repeated Saving to Minister of State, Cairo. [][][] Prime Minister returned to this theme in conversation with me on September 24th. He said that the time had now come for him to implement his promise of last summer to add a third Shiah to the Cabinet, a step which would entail other changes the extent and scope of which would depend mainly upon relations between the Minister of Finance and the Minister of the Interior. If as he hoped this problem could be solved on an enduring basis the re-shuffling would be simple. But if as was mare than likely the former had to go reorganisation would be wider. Assuming that the latter course would be inevitable he contemplated^ bringing in Tewfik Suwaidi although this would mean a tussle with the Regent. He then produced a list of changes he had in mind and * invited me to comment on it after consultation with ■■Go-ma'M-dMag and adviser to Ministry Positior _ i Captain Holt and Mr. Edmonds, our main preoccupation being to ensure if possible that somebody with personality and power of decision be appointed to the Ministry of Finance which has to deal with all supply questions now rapidly growing in difficulty and importance. Having decided on certain suggestions we all three conferred again to-day with the Prune Minister and as a result His Excellency declared that if Ali Mumtaz had to go he would propose to the Regent the transfer of present Minister of the Interior to Finance with Tewfik Suwaidi as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Abdul Azziz A1 Qassab at Interior, Nuri Pasha himself retaining Defence. The other changes about three in number need not be reported in detail but the net result would be that the Cabinet would contain three Shiahs and two Kurds. The Prime Minister attached the utmost importance to having Tewfik Suwaidi in the Cabinet because the support which he would thus gain in the Senate and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs would leave him ample leisure foi^his work. 3. It remains to be seen how the Regent reacts should it be necessary to consult hm on the above basis. Changes would take place at the end of Ramadan so that the new administration might have two or three weeks to settle down before the Legislature reassembles on November 1st.y^A. p* 'iw ‘TL&amp;Jtr &amp; ft** w [This telegram is of particular secrecy and should he gained by the authorised recipient and not passed onj* [Cypher] .-r f WAR GABIKBT DISTRIBUTION. / L.*/ F ROM IRAQ f 'io'l r l| FROM BAG-SAD TO FOREIGN OFFICE.

Bagdad, August 2, 1942 i Hh two and a-half, months which have elapsed since I wrote my last general despatch contained no outstanding feature nor any coherent pattern of events to invest them with special significance or importance. The political, economic and social life of the country continued to effervesce quietly, but without movement in any definable direction, and I fear that little of sensational interest can be instilled into an account of so formless a period. 2. From the middle of May onwards much of my time was taken up with ministrations to the senile ailments of a Government that shows signs of approaching the end of its expectation of life. As I related in my last despatch, the trouble began with the strain imposed upon the cohesion of the members of the Cabinet by the trial and execution of three of Rashid Ali’s colleagues, and the subsequent difficulties which the Cabinet had to face caused further stresses which tended to be cumulative in effect. 3. Soon after the executions the Prime Minister had a physical collapse and the doctors ordered rest and change. Nuri Pasha thought of a holiday in Syria .or Transjordan, and there at once arose the question of who should act as Prime Minister during his absence. Subtle questions of seniority and sensitive jealousies made the choice of a locum tenens from among his colleagues more than difficult. Nuri Pasha therefore favoured the solution of bringing Taufiq Suwaidi into the Cabinet. As a former Prime Minister, Taufiq Beg would, without question, have presided over Cabinet meetings while the Prime Minister was away. The other Ministers were not. however, well disposed towards this idea. They suspected that the Prime Minister was trying to put through a cunning reinsurance deal with the other side, and foresaw that Taufiq Suwaidi’s presence in the Cabinet would lead to complications because of his close relation ship with Naji Suwaidi, one of the most important of the Iraqi politicians interned in Southern Rhodesia. The Regent for personal reasons also disliked the idea of Taufiq Suwaidi’s entering the Cabinet, and Nuri Pasha had to give up his plan. The possibility of inducing Ibrahim Kemal to enter the Cabinet was also examined, but he was found to be still too antagonistic to Nuri Pasha to be willing to accept such a proposal. 4. Fortunately, at this stage it was discovered that the Prime Minister’s physical troubles were due not to nerves, as had at first been supposed, but to teeth. The need for him to take prolonged rest outside Iraq passed, and with it the crisis caused by the difficulty of finding an Acting Prime Minister. Nuri Pasha was subjected to a few days’ drastic dental treatment, enjoyed ten days’ holiday in the Kurdish hills, and then returned to Bagdad at the beginning of July in excellent health. 5. The next crisis came only a week later, when the Minister of Finance, Ali Mumtaz, resigned. He complained that he was not accorded proper help and co-operation by his colleagues (especially the Minister of the Interior) in dealing with the distribution of food supplies, and was upset because he had not been informed in advance about the internments of harmful persons ordered bv the Minister of the Interior on the 5th July. The Prime Minister, the Minister of the Interior and Ali Mumtaz himself all came to me to talk at length and in detail over their troubles. Each one threw a favourable light on his own position, leaving the others in the shadow of doubt, and on each one I impressed the virtue of conciliation and sweet reasonableness. The biggest rift in the lute was clearly caused by the internments. It was not Ali Mumtaz alone who was upset; none of the other Ministers liked to see the Minister of the Interior and the Prime Minister in a position to shut up people at discretion without reference to the Cabinet, It was noticed, moreover, that Nuri Pasha always protected his friends, however bad their record, and the other Ministers resented an arrange ment which left them powerless to do the same for their own dependants and [32—42] b2 / ¥% supporters. They thought that they should have some share in the decisions taken, but opinions varied as to its degree. The Minister of the Interior was, however, clear-sighted enough to see that, if all Ministers were to protect their friends, no one would be interned at all. and he in his turn threatened to resign if such a proposal was adopted. The Prime Minister sought to find a solution on the basis of an arrangement whereby, though the Minister of the Interior would retain unimpaired the power to intern anyone whose activities were harmful, other Ministers would be given lists of the internments ordered on the ^ day on which the orders were carried out. Though no final decision has yet been reached, his colleagues are for the moment mollified and some procedure of this kind is likely to be adopted. Meanwhile, the experience has made the Minister of the Interior shy of further drastic internments. . • 6. The other grievances of the Minister of Finance were assuaged by the results of a good deal of honest brokering by myself and some straight talking to the Minister of the Interior. The result was that Ali Mumtaz agreed to return to his office and resume his work. Another crisis seemed thus to have been averted, but the hoped-for tranquillity did not supervene and a fresh shock came only a few days later. 7. On the 19th July Nuri Pasha appointed Abdul Illah Hafidh (Director- General of Revenues in the Ministry of Finance) Minister of Economics, and the next day Abdul Mahdi, the Minister of Communications and Works, demanded the immediate appointment of a third Shiah Minister. The religious tenets of Abdul Illah Hafidh are in doubt, but he is not accepted by the orthodox Shiahs as belonging to their community, and Abdul Mahdi, ' in pressing for the appointment of another Shiah, took his stand on the principle accepted when Nuri Pasha formed his Cabinet in October 1941, that it should include three Shiah Ministers. Since the resignation of Sadiq Bassam in February there have been only two, and Abdul Mahdi seems to have feared that the Prime Minister was about to ignore the accepted principle and fill up his Cabinet with Sunnis. My intervention again became necessary to save the Cabinet from a fall. The Prime Minister was angry, Abdul Mahdi was obstinate and Salih Jabr, though ready at the last resort to be loyal to his chief, gave strong moral support to Abdul Mahdi. Three days of hard talking in sweltering heat somewhat lessened the tension. The Prime Minister reaffirmed his acceptance of the principle of three Shiah Ministers and, tempers having rather surprisingly cooled, both sides approached the task of finding a suitable candidate for Cabinet office. It was soon found that there are sadly few Shiahs who .could be considered eligible, and the choice was quickly narrowed to a very few men. Two alone survived final examination—Abbas Mahdi, the head of the Royal Diwan, and Abdul Muhsin Shallash, who was last in the Cabinet in 1929 as a Minister of Communications and Works. Abbas Mahdi refused to give up his honourable sinecure for the hurly-burly of active politics, and Muhsin-al-Shallash said that he must first go to Palestine for medical treatment, but might agree to take office later if his health permitted. Thereupon the idea of making any further appointments to the Cabinet, whether Sunni or Shiah, was put aside for the time being, and it was agreed by all the Ministers that they should carry on as at present until the mid of August. The Prime Minister quite rightly calls this arrangement a truce and not a peace, and it seems likely that changes in the Cabinet will become necessary before long. 8. The internments which started this chain of Cabinet troubles were made as the result of my urgent and reiterated warnings to the Prime Minister and the Minister of the-Interior that there were still many people at large who were dangerously active in the interests of the Axis. On the 24th May I gave the Minister of the Interior, for his guidance, a list of seventy-five sucn men living in different parts of the country and urged him to send them to the newly established internment camp at Amara. A short period of hesitation, followed by the Prime Minister’s illness, resulted in action being undesirably delayed, but by much prodding and prompting the Minister was at last persuaded to move! and during the night of the 5th-6th July over thirty arrests were made. By the end of the month the total had been raised to fifty-six, and, though a number of bad men still remained free, the effect on public security was excellent. Malicious agitation, intrigue and rumour-mongering were sharply checked, and, warned by the fate of their friends, most of the pro-Nazis who retained their liberty became careful to do nothing that might cause them to lose it. 9. Another security measure which was put through successfully with the co-operation of the Iraqi authorities was the rounding-up and despatch to Palestine for internment of the last of the nationals of enemy or enemy-occupiedr 3 countries remaining in Iraq. In all, nearly a hundred were sent off on the 5th July, mostly Hungarians and Germans, with smaller numbers of Bulgarians and Roumanians. 10. Of the many and varied small events in the internal life of the country which have occurred, the following are all that seem to merit attention : 11. About the middle of June the endemic enmity between the Shammer of the Northern Jezireh and the Yazidis of the Jabal Sinjar once more threatened i to break out in violence. The trouble arose over the ownership of a village on the borders of the Sinjar, for which, during the past few years, Sufuq, the Sheikh of the Shammer, had obtained legal title-deeds, but to which the 1 azidi chieftain, Daud-i-Daud, also laid claim on the ground that before his flight out of Iraq in 1935 he and his forebears had cultivated it for generations. When the villagers had cut and stacked the crops on the threshing floors and the time came for the landlord to collect his share, Yazidis and Shammers gathered in force and a fight was only prevented by official intervention. For both the tribes the matter then became one of prestige (the landlord’s share of the crops was not worth more than about £10 15s.) and settlement called for much patience. The first step taken was to call Sufuq and Daud-i-Daud into Mosul and to take into official charge the disputed share of the harvest until iiT could be disposed of peacefully. Daud-i-Daud, who is wild, quick-tempered and suspicious, was found to be in a dangerously turbulent mood and was sent to Sulaimani to cool his heels. Sufuq was more amenable, though unwilling to yield his legal rights without a satisfactory quid pro quo. Efforts are now* being made to find an enduring settlement on the basis of the grant of Government land elsewhere to Sufuq in return for his surrender of his title to the disputed village. 12. In the Dohuk district north of Mosul the new mutasarrif, Majid Tacubi, has been taking vigorous action to clear up the gang of bandits which had collected there under Salim Mustafa, an outlaw who some years ago murdered an American missionary. The special police force organised for this work has had successful skirmishes and inflicted casualties on the gang. Operations continue. 13. The Regent made two useful tours. During the last week in May he visited the Hillah Diwaniyah and Muntafiq Liwas. His Royal Highness was most cordially received by the tribes, and he worked hard to make a good impression. Soon afterwards he set out on a tour of the Kirkuk and bulaimani Liwas, but, unfortunately, after reaching Sulaimani he had to return suddenly for medical treatment as one of his pet dogs was found to have developed rabies. In early July His Royal Highness took a fortnight s holiday in the Kurdish hills near Arbil, where the young King and the Queen Mother are passing the hot weather. , 1 . _ r . , 14. On the 18th July the Army Commander, on behalf of His Majesty s Government, handed over forty armoured cars to the Iraqi army. The ceremony was attended by the Prime Minister and Cabinet and, as it was preceded by a drive of the cars through the town, it attracted a good deal of attention. Comment seems to have been divided. Some Iraqi gossips thought that this act showed our o-oodwill and desire to help the country, while others expressed amazement at the putting of such comparatively up-to-date fighting equipment into the hands of men who had behaved so treacherously only a year ago. On the whole, howevei, the vesture seems to have been a. success, aitnough a number of British officers did their best to ruin it by proclaiming, within the hearing of barmen and others, that the cars were out of date and useless. Renewed attempts are being made, with the co-operation of Tenth Army, to check such loose talk by those who should know better. . . , „ 15. Professor Hamley has been able to make some progress with the reform of the Ministry of Education, but it seems clear that he will continue to meet with serious obstruction until Dr. Sami Shaukat and Dr. Fadhil Jamali, the joint Directors-General, are removed. The Prime Minister has come reluctantly to realise this fact, and is trying to obtain an eminent Egyptian educationalist as a new head of the department. Meanwhile, Professor Hamley has enhanced his already hi°'h reputation by organising a successful summer school for older boys in which he has been able to demonstrate the value of sane, healthy principles of education, while indicating at the same time the opportunities that exist for constructive youthful endeavour within the country. It is hoped in this manner to combat to some extent the pessimism that seems to cloud so many young minds m Iraq 16 Summer time was officially introduced into Iraq on the 21st June. At 11 p.m. that day all clocks were advanced by one hour, thereby putting Iraq four hours ahead of Greenwich. In a clock-less country where the great mass of [32—42] B 24 he people naturally regulate their habits by the sun such a manipulation of time had little consequence except for the official and commercial classes, and so far as hey weie concerned the new arrangement was made largely ineffective by puttin 0, forward by an hour or half an hour the time of beginning work. . Supply problems have on the whole been handled smoothly and so far with enough success to avoid trouble. On the 1st July the wholesale price of wheat was fixed at between I.D. 23/000 and I.D. 25 per ton according to the district of production, and the Government hope to be able to put into effect a plan for obliging all growers to surrender up to 25 per cent, of their crop at these prices. he\ expect in this manner to obtain sufficient stocks to ensure supplies to the towns throughout the winter. In most districts there was no unfavourable reaction at the time the prices were announced, though little of the new crop (which on the whole is good) has yet been put on the market; in Mosul, as a result of a misunderstanding of the position combined with scare rumours about .^^ ar ’J t grain sellers suddenly ceased trading, and for a few days about the mmaie of July the mutasarrif was faced with a tiresome situation in the town, bupphes of wheat were, however, hurried up from Bagdad and the immediate difficulty was o\ercome, but the wheat holders are still hoarding and sooner or later means will have, to be devised to persuade or make them sell. Since our defeat m Libya enemy propaganda has been most vocal in urging all and sundry to hoard wheat and has skilfully played on memories of the famine durino- the lust wai. In addition, speculation has been rife and has been favoured by higher prices m adjacent countries. Finally, as has happened on occasion elsewhere'’the Government are reluctant to make themselves unpopular with powerful vested interests. I have been urging ministers to face up to the situation and to explain their policy to the people, and my efforts are continuing at the time of writing. 18. Iraq’s relations with her neighbours have remained normal. Nothing of interest occurred with Turkey except the protracted negotiations for extradition of ^alah-ud-Din babbagh, the leader of the traitor generals of last year. 1 hese have so far yielded no result in spite of the personal visit to Angora of the Iraqi Public Prosecutor. •n 19 ‘- reco g nition of the new Governments in Syria and the Lebanon is still withheld, but the Prime Minister may perhaps be willing to accord recognition after new elections have been carried out and constitutional Govern ments installed. 20. Relations with Saudi Arabia have become easier. At a meeting which Assad Beg the Saudi Charge d’Afiaires, and Shukri Quwatli (the Syrian P? 1 f 1( :l a . n ^oo, since his return to Bagdad from the Haj, has been interestino- himself m the settlement of outstanding disputes between the two countries) had with Mr Edmonds, the adviser to the Ministry of the Interior, on the 22nd June they told him that Ibn Saud, moved by advice which I had offered to Assad Beo- that the Arab Governments should drop all minor squabbles and concentrate on the larger issues, had sent instructions to his Legation not to press further for a solution of the vexed boundary and Shammer questions but to seek simple satisfaction m a number of trans-border raiding cases, the victims of which were petitioning the King for redress. They explained that lists of these cases had been given to the Iraqi Government and asked for and were readily Given an assurance that the Adviser for his part would do all he could to see^that each case was properly investigated and settled one way or the other by methods which would satisfy Bedouin standards of fair play. 21. Taking into consideration existing conditions, the Kurdish tribes on the Iraq-Persia frontier have remained surprisingly calm. At the end of Wav there was some fear that Hama Rashid Khan of Waina might renew hostilities and the Persian Government requested the Iraqi Government to p^t pressure to bear on him to withdraw to Iraq. The Adviser to the Ministry of the Interior toured the frontier near Panjwin to see what could be done and found that the local Persian authorities were already negotiating with Hama Rashid and other Kurdish chieftains Details of the result of these negSfons hale not reached Bagdad, but fighting between the tribes and the Persians ant,ears to have ceased for some time In June the Persians complained of the Arrival in Iran of the Jaf tribe on their annual migration from Iraq They seen to have feared that the Jaf would join the insurgent Persian Kurdish tribes and later on threatened to bomb them if they did not withdraw. The Jaf chieftatns however, took the matter in hand themselves, and the situation was eased when they sent presents to the local Persian military commanders. Gn 22. Some months ago the Iraqi Government proposed to the Persian Government that the work of re-erecting, where necessary, the frontier pillars5 he rpmim^ri . P rov ided for in the Frontier Treaty of 1937, should ‘irhdmfo,. ij u ’ m or d er to settle technical disputes on the spot, a British thp Pm-oio S r^° U a PP°^ n t6d to the joint commission.

The successes achieved by the German offensive on tne Don caused and continue to cause anxiety amounting in some quarters to dismay but there are no signs of any growth of public hostility. On the contrary, thanks in some measure to the work of our Public Relations Department; tiere is evidence that at last a belief in the rightness of the principles of democracy m beginning to grow. If a resolute Government can be kept in office and an adequate distribution of food supplies be maintained, I feel that on the facts as they are known to us we are justified in feeling confident that, provided the enemy can be kept from her frontiers, Iraq will now stand true to her alliance to the end of the war. 24.

CM*;. */' jUl, !&amp; Z m, JC u&gt;l^zj AoU-/93 lo SfJL # Position within the Government here'has unfortunately deteriorated with some suddenness during the last fortyeight hours. &lt; Although the Minister of Finance has now withdrawn his resignation, at any rate for the time being, and while reasonably efficient Director General of Revenue has been appointed Minister of Economics, it is clear that the Cabinet are in a very unhappy state. 2. Immediate cause is the action of the Minister of Communications who on July 20 th confronted Nuri Pasha with a demand for appointment within a day or two of another Shia Minister, failing which he [? grp. omtd.] resign. Of the six candidates proposed by His excellency four were disputable and the other two men of little weight. Regrettable as it is that M Sunni-Shia n issue should be raised at this moment, the Prime Minister has no objection to increasing the number of Shia Ministers (there are only two at present) but he resented being rushed and a quarrel ensued. 3. Since then I have had long interviev/s with the Regent, Nuri Pasha and Minister of the Interior. In each case I have emphasized the grave consequences of a Cabinet crisis and the consequent importance of avoiding hasty action. I have endeavoured to smooth down the Prime Minister who is still incensed, and I have urged the Regent to use his influence with the Minister of Communications. It is possible that these representations may lead to some compromise, but of course each wrangle amongst the Ministers leaves its mark. Nuri would like to resign and reform his Cabinet but is deterred by the knowledge that suitable alternative Ministers whether Sunni or Shia do not exist. 4 V Should the Minister of Communications withdraw from the Cabinet the Minister of the Interior has assured me that he would remain loyal to the Prime Minister. He points out however that a crisis on a sectarian issue would cause a very ■ bad impression and would subject him to strong attacks from Shia and make it difficult for him to carry out any bold policy. he/warn wmmm ■■■■ . , 2 .

It is a pity for he undoubtedly possesses some resolution. But his attempt to oust Saleh Jabr who is obviously best Minister of Interior available is a shocking instance of the irresponsibility of responsible Iraqis at a critical time.

The Minister of^the Interior told me to-day that in accordance with my advice to the Prime Minister he hadhad a four hour conversation with the Minister of Finance. This had passed off pleasantly and he had given the most emphatic assurances with the result that in the end Ali Mumtaz has expressed his thanks and pleasure and had withdrav/n his accusations of ’’non co-operation” without, however, agreeing to remain in the Cabinet. He now complained of ’’fatigue”. 2. &gt; The Prime Minister who followed the Minister of the Interior had also seen the Minister of Finance and would do so again to-day. 3. After some discussion on minor points, Nuri Pasha spoke about the recent internments and mentioned that none of the Cabinet (except the Minister of the Interior) were pleased with the present procedure. They felt that they ought to have some share in the decisions though opinions varied as to the degree. I replied that this would be a great mistake. Every Minister including Nuri Pasha himself, was protecting the people we thought should be in Amarah. No doubt the Minister^ motives v/ere of the highest, but a widening of responsibility would inevitably increase the number of 'protected” suspects and so much pressure would be exerted on each Minister from outside that hardly any of the men that mattered would be detained. I thought the Minister of the Interior might resign on such an tissue and in my view he would be right. The Ministers not directly concerned had, however, the right to be informed of decisions taken by the Minister of the Interior with the approval of the Regent and the Prime Minister before the news could reach them from other sources.4, The Prime Minister admitted the force of my remarks and said he would try and find a solution* As regards the Minister of Finance, he feared that he was determined to go whatever was said or done but he■would do his best to dissuade him* 5* If he goes, I fear Ibrahim Kemal does not look- promising, as a successor.

Repeated to Minister of State. Government of india Saving. IMPORTANT, My telegram No. 699 last sentence. Yesterday the Minister of Finance called to inform me that he had submitted his resignation. He gave his reasons at length. Briefly they were, firstly, that for some time he felt he had not been accorded the nelp and co-operation to which he was entitled [grp.undec ?from] certain of his colleagues and notably the Minister of the Interior, and secondly, that he had not been informed in advance of recent arrests of M fifth-columnists ' 0 Minister protested that he was not opposed to internments nor did he expect to be consulted but he was'entitled to be treated with confidence. 2 . I advised him strongly against resigning at this moment and did not mince my words which will be reported in greater detail by despatch,. He finally consented to with-hold action until he had seen the Prime Minister to whom I at once telephoned. 3. To-day Nuri Pasha informed me he had had a long con versation with Minister of Finance but had failed to persuade the latter to withdraw his resignation. Ali Muntaz he declared, was tired, heartily disliked the Ministers of Interior and of Communications, and was ’'annoyed 1 ’ over internment of at least two of those lately detained. It is certainly a fact that Minister of Finance has been at loggerheads with the other two Ministers mentioned for some time, but I agree that arrests were probably the last straw although this he will not admit. 4. Prime Minister has informed Minister of Finance that he hopes the latter will yet think better of his decision and that, in any case, he must continue at his post until the Regent returns to Bagdad. 5. I told Nuri Pasha that_it would be^deplorable if a_ Minister resigned because he failed to obtain ^co-operation'' of two colleagues and still more deplorable &gt; if the said colleagues on hearing'accusations failed to do all in their power to remove misunderstanding. I urged him to see both and ootain fullest assurance of their willingness to ’’co-operate” in future. The Prime Minister agreed. But if as I fear may be anticipated, no result is achieved, he will ask the Regent to return at once. 6 . We had some discussion over possible successor to Minister of Finance should he prove adamant. I said Ibrahim Kemal was obviously the most capable candidate and that he would strengthen the Cabinet if only he and the rest could pull together, Nuri Pasha answered he was quite ready to try. He would sound his colleagues if it became necessary and I agreed for my part to find out INDIV. discreetly how Ibrahim Kemal would react. There matters stand for the moment.

I warned His Excellency that it would he wise to he prepared for worse news from Egypt and to take all precautions in Iraq from now on. I advised him_in the first place to examine the list of his provincial officials, including Commandant and Assistant Commandant of Police and to rid himself of any whan he did not trust. 3. The Minister replied that action on these lines had already occurred to him and he would proceed as suggested; certain changes would have to he made, lie was more worried about hig cities than about provincial districts and I think that he is right. He had changed police officers and constables in Bagdad and^ there were very few now who had been here in May, 1941. The Minister felt that Bagdad Police were now strong and in addition to them he had a mobile force of 2.000 men available. There was naturally a great deal of pessimistic talk and pro-Axis groups were exploiting it. There were, however, no (repeat no; signs at present of any impending trouble. Orders had nevertheless been issued for [grp. omtd. Js to be strengthened and for the police to be on the alert, especially in Jewish quarters. 4. The Minister of the Interior expressed his wish to proceed S-V^At once wittqinternments psee m y te legram No. 477). He had discussed this with the Regent'aiidlTt woqld be taken up with the Prime Minister immediately on the latter’s return on July 2nd. He felt it necessary to await the Prime Minister as he was anxious to detain some of the n bigmen n but was not certain that Nuri Pasha would agree to all he had in mind. I urged His Excellency to watch the situation &gt; very clqsely and if there were any signs of trouble, to take immediate action, ^If^the Prime Minister had not returned he must be recalled. The Minister agreed. He anticipated making the arrests by the night of July 3rd at the latest. 5, As regards possible future developments the Minister, in reply to a question from me, expressed the opinion that if the Gpve^nment were resolute they would be able to keep the country Governmen t were resolut e they would be able to keep the country ^ ■'WOiliftukt W Mk b W!

If the latter could not hold the Germans it was hardly reasonable to expect that Iraqis would he able to do so. He thought that the Iraqi Army was all right for the moment but he had no faith in its fighting qualities if it came to actual war (this confirms exactly the opinion which I have previously expressed). On this subject the Minister considered the Prime Minister was over optimistic. The former went on to say that the Cabinet was at present strong ' and united but His Excellency foresaw that when it came to interning certain prominent persons he might find it difficult to avoid 'offending' some of his colleagues. However he was not unduly pessimistic on this score. 6 . In general I found the Minister full of energy and apparently determined to get a move on. This is gratifying because the bad news from the Western Desert has undoubtedly caused great nervousness amongst our friends here. They are inclined to take the line (and this is understandable) that while no doubt Germany will ultimately be overthrown they will suffer at the hands of their own people'lf the Nazis should first over-run Iraq, INDIVV J^c^c tlLM.

KINAHAN CORNWALLIS. ^7 lf. 0 . y&gt; 'P.A. H.O &gt; h Enclosure. Morale and Attitude of Iraqi Army on May 14, 1942. 1. Introduction. MANY of the \iews here set forth are ones that have already been expressed verbally both to His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador and to the General Officer Commanding, Xth Army. But before committing them to writing, as requested m His Britannic Majesty’s Embassy letter of the 10th May, 1942, ^consulted the officers of the mission under my command. I find that their opinions not only agree with all that I have previously said, but that their view T s enlarge my own. Included in these officers is one wffio has recently been attached for a month with sixty Iraqi officers, another whose work is largely m the office, but who has much contact both with officers in the Ministry of Defence and also outside, though mostly m the Bagdad area; and a third who, though new to Iraq has been in the Middle East for three years now, during two of which he worked in close con junction with the Intelligence branch of the General Staff of the Egyptian army and who was for the last year with Senussi troops (Libyan Arab Force). He has just paid brief visits to all garrisons in Iraq south of Bagdad. Thus the confirma tory views that I have received are from officers of varied experience and cover a wide field. 2. Morale. I myself have seen all of the Iraq army in barracks, on the march, and at training. I think that they have now largely forgotten the blow to their prestige suffered in May 1941. They see around them the Xth Army apparently very lar^e and apparently well equipped. 1 he tone of the Arabic press is favourable and stresses British, American and Bussian successes, and imported goods are more plentiful. Thus the foundations for a good morale exist amongst the officers and those who can read and write. Added to this there is a good deal of inborn conceit in the Iraqis. They consider that, given favourable conditions, they can be a match for anyone. Both the officers and men work cheerfully and keenly and f 30—47 ] mmmmmrnmmmmx , , , B ENCLOSE IN WEEKLY LITTER **2 7 4 4 JUL 1942 EROM SECRETARY, EXTERNAL DEPT., INDtA OFFiCEtheir physique is on the whole good. However unpopular conscription may be, the men, at all events, seem happy and contented once they are in the army. The improvement seen in the conscripted recruits after two months is most marked, due largely to good feeding. There is a great deal of really good material in the ranks. But although they may feel that they are more than a match for anyon^^ iunder favourable conditions, morale must inevitably be affected by their shortag^^ of transport and modern equipment. Given this morale would be not merely good but excellent. 3. Attitude. (a) Like other Eastern nations, the Iikqis are first and foremost pro- Iraqi. Friendship with Britain, if adopted, is only because the Iraqis feel they must for the present have some supporting Power. On the*other hand, friendship with Britain’s enemies would be merely a means of disposing of the Power that at the moment has the closest hold in Iraq in exchange for another from whom more favourable conditions might be obtained. The Iraqis know that at present they cannot stand alone. The degree to which the British will be those whom they support depends on a number of factors which I set out below. These affect the army as much as the civil population. (5) Coupled with Nationalist pro-Iraqi sentiment there is possibly a slight sentiment even in the army towards a Pan-Arab movement. Its only danger is if exploited by Britain’s enemies. (c) On the other hand, even Iraq itself is not a united nation. Arabs, Kurds, .Sunnis, Shias, Armenians, Assyrians and Jews, not to mention Bagdadis and Mosulawis are divided by so many racial, religious and other distinctions that rivalry and jealousy always exist. This is responsible for a mass of reports, seldom disinterested and often entirely false. It has reached such a stage that to denounce a rival or enemy is almost a national sport, with the result that many officers of the army have been included in various Intelligence reports both as absolutely pro-British and extremely pro-Nazi. What seldom appears in Intelligence reports is the motives that lead up to any stated Iraqi’s attitude. The fact that most unit interpreters and the staff of so many British messes, canteens, coffee shops and local hotels are almost entirely Armenians, Assyrians and Jews is undoubtedly responsible for many prejudiced reports. (d) From the Germans the Iraqis have had a lot. First and foremost, genuine friendship from a small but skilful band of Germans under Herr Doktor Grobba. Not just a few “sticky ’’ tea parties and a few organised “ set-piece ’’ entertain ments, but genuine social intercourse. Such few Germans as were here were “ good mixers,” in marked contrast to the British insularity and aloofness. Moreover, when the British were talking and promising goods at some distant date, the Germans were able to, and actually did, supply goods and equip ment, and did so without haggling over the price. Why shouldn’t they, as if they win the war they get it all back and more. As a result of deliveries actually received from Germany and those arranged from elsewhere by Germany, including Turkey, Vichy, Syria, Italy earlier on, and from Japan (regarded for long as an Axis Power), German promises were regarded with good favour. Added to this a long tale of unparalleled success on land, and it is scarcely to be wondered at that a nation whose seaboard is limited to the head of the Persian Gulf should accept German propaganda at its face value, the more so as British propaganda was virtually non-existent. But the story now changes. (e) In May 1941 Iraq received no appreciable help from the Axis, and the German elements were completely discredited in consequence of the disastrous failure of the attempted cou'p. Since then the British have secured Persia on one side and Syria on the other, whilst Turkey is defiant and, in Iraq opinion, likely to resist any aggression that can at present come about. The Japanese, though successful, are regarded as an inferior nation and their successes do not offset the German failure in Russia. The press over a prolonged period has been giving prominence to British successes and to British views. Our publicity is now good without being blatant—in fact, the average Iraqi now feels that Germany will ultimately be defeated. This belief is of primary importance, since orientals must always be on the winning side: in spite of all their faults and defects, it is the British who are winning.(/) Yet another and potent factor in the conviction that Germany will he defeated is the participation in the war of America. Deeds speak louder than words. No longer is the Iraqi impressed by the braying that 88 million people must be right. It is 120 million who can outproduce the 88 million and are evidently doing so. Quantities of American aircraft are passing (with United v^ates markings) through Basra airport. American ships are in the Shatt-el- Arab. American technicians are much in evidence, and quantities of American goods are now appearing in the market. And, finally, above all, there is the inclusion of Iraq in the provisions of the Lease and Lend Act. The British may fail to keep promises to deliver war material, but now the wealth of American output is available to them on the same terms as to others. At last the army of a country that is not rich sees itself able to have a modern, well-equipped army and is prepared to run and perhaps fall again though hardly past the walking stage. (g) Lastly, there is the attitude of Turkey. Most of the senior and older officers received their military education in Turkey, and through being in the Turkish army in the last war have already seen an apparently invincible German army suffer final defeat. Though as Iraqis they were prompt to throw off the Turkish yoke and themselves assume all the privileges of the Turkish ruling classes, they no longer have any hatred of the new Turkey nor of its people, with whom so many of them are closely connected. Angora radio is widely listened to in Iraq, though perhaps largely because reception from Bagdad is often bad, and whatever Turkey does will have an enormous effect. If a large and relatively powerful Turkey finds herself later as the result of German successes in such a position to be unable or unwilling to offer resistance to Germany, even with the British behind her, what can the Iraqis hope to achieve ? (A) Such then are the motives that may guide the mind of the average thinking Iraqi, both in and out of the army—and they do think—think a lot. What is his character ? Besides intelligence and love of being on the winning side, they are stolid and cheerful, can endure hardship and, especially in the north, have military instincts. Regimentally they fought well last year. But above all, like Arabs, they have a great sense of hospitality and friendship. The average Iraqi officer is only too willing to be friendly with the average British officer. But most British officers arrive in the country with a strong anti-Iraqi prejudice, which is further strengthened by the fact that their only regular con tact is with interpreters, &amp;c., mostly Christians and Jews, all biassed against the Iraq Moslems, of which the Iraq army largely consists. If they would only take a little trouble it could be achieved, but, alas, I continually receive reports showing how difficult the Iraqis find it. Not only do they feel that the British officers in general are making little or no effort (apart from a few British commanders and a few individuals, as well as the British Military Mission), they are even made to feel that they are not being trusted. It is difficult for a man who knows he is not trusted and who knows that his attempts at friendship are not reciprocated to fight gladly with the British, especially when invited to do so deficient of trans port, A.A. artillery and A/T equipment. 4. Attitude of Army. The improvement in the whole feeling of the army since October has been most marked. I consider this largely due to Nuri Said and Ismail Namiq, the Chief of General Staff, who have undoubtedly cleared out the majority of the doubtful elements and put in officers who wish to co-operate with us. The British officers of the military mission (several of whom now speak Arabic) have found their efforts to establish confidence readily responded to and there is a considerable feeling of camaraderie between the British and Iraqi branches of the Iraq army which has directly influenced the spirit to co-operate which now undoubtedly exists. 5. Conclusions. Were Turkey to collapse under German threats after a successful Caucasus campaign and were it evident that the British, besides carrying out their rehearsed plans of extensive withdrawals from Mosul, intended to or w r ere likely to be forced south of Bagdad, it is quite possible that Iraq would be as compliant to German demands as Roumania, Bulgaria or Hungary : that is to say, theywould perhaps fail to resist. This, I think, is the worst that would, happen. Actually, even under these conditions, I think it possible that part of the Iraq army would fight with us. The junior officers are following the lead of their seniors, and I do not believe there is now any leader in the army who would try to lead them against their Ally, Great Britain. Morale is good. They want to h^ our friends. All that is wanted is a little encouragement, both moral a'' material. D. G.

Cornwallis to Mr. Eden.—(Received May 27.) Copy No. 118 -pa. (No. 136.) Sir, Bagdad, May 15, 1942. THE outstanding political event of the four months that have elapsed since I wrote my last despatch on the general situation in this country was the trial of six of Rashid Airs principal associates in the cony d'Etat of April 1941. They were Ali Mahmud Sheikh Ali, Tunis Sabawi, Amin Zaki Sulaiman, Fahmi Said, Mahmud Salman and Sadiq Shanshal. These men, having been sent back from South Africa under escort, arrived at Basra on the 11 th March and their trial began a few days later before a military court set up in the Washshash Barracks in Bagdad West. Judgment was delivered unanimously on the 4th May. Tunis Sabawi, Mahmud Salman and Fahmi Said were sentenced to death; Amin Zaki to five years’, and Ali Mahmud Sheikh Ali to seven years’ imprisonment; Sadiq Shansnal was acquitted but at once interned. The death sentences were carried out by hanging in the early hours of the 5th May. 2 . At the beginning the public were generally indifferent, but, towards the end of the trial, press reports on the proceedings stimulated interest and comment. Among the ordinary people the accused had few supporters, and many were heard to declare openly that they richly deserved hanging. The army, which condemned the failure rather than the politics of their erstwhile commanders, allowed them to go to the scaffold without an audible murmur of sympathy or protest. Within the Cabinet two Ministers showed a desire to escape responsi bility. Abdullah Damluji, who became Minister for Foreign Affairs early in February, tendered his resignation soon after the trial began, and, when the Regent delayed acceptance, remained ill in his house. His place at the Ministry was taken temporarily by Daud Haidari, the Minister of Justice. Tahsin Ali, Minister of Education, was also fearful of the work which lay ahead, but managed to screw up enough courage to hold on to his seat in the Cabinet. The effect of the trial and executions has been salutary. Official authority has been vindicated, factious politicians have been rebuked, and law-abiding citizens have been encouraged to have greater faith in the stability of the national institutions of the country. 3. Some Cabinet changes were made in February. Amin Zaki, Minister of Communications, finally gave way to ill-health after five months' confinement to his bed, and Sadiq Bassam, Minister of Justice, left in a pet after a personal quarrel with a colleague. Saiyid Abdul Mahdi was thereupon made Minister of Communications (retaining also his portfolio as Minister of Economics), Daud- al-Haidari was recalled from the Iraqi Legation in Tehran to be Minister of Justice, and Abdullah Damluji was given the portfolio of Foreign Affairs, which had temporarily been held by Salih Jabr. These changes made little or no difference to the policy of the Cabinet, which remained under the influence of the three most forceful members : Nuri Said, Salih Jabr and Ali Mumtaz. 4 . The Government have continued to take measures to suppress pro-Axis intrigues and propaganda. On the 3rd February six Palestinians and four Iraqis were arrested. They were members of an organisation which had as its chief aims political murder and the destruction of important links in national communication. Bombs, firearms and treasonable literature were found in their houses. On the 25th February twenty-five serving and pensioned officers of the* Iraqi army were arrested and interned, and the next day twenty civilians followed them to Fao. An alternative internment camp capable of accommodating at least 500 persons is now being laid out at Amarah. The General Officer Commanding Xth Army is helping by providing tents and barbed wire. In April the [30—2] 1rEC3.POL.DEPt. ) 2JUN 942 INDIA OFFICE /?.Minister of the Interior suppressed the Muthannah Club and the Rovers’ Club, two organisations which for some time before the events of last summer had played a prominent part in all extreme Nationalist and anti-British agitation. Other licensed clubs and associations are being reviewed and several are likely to be closed down. 5. In Iraqi foreign affairs the evetlt of note was the visit to Bagdad i/** March of Dr. P. C. Chang, the Chinese Minister at Angora, which concluded with the signing of a treaty of friendship between Iraq and China. The treaty provided for perpetual friendship and the establishment of normal diplomatic relations between the two countries. It does not come into force until after the exchange of ratifications, The special position of His Britannic Majesty’s representative in Iraq is safeguarded by an exchange of notes stipulating that the provisions of the treaty shall be applied in harmony with the provisions of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of Alliance of 1930. During his stay of about a fortnight in Bagdad Dr. Chang gave two public lectures on Chinese culture and history which were much appreciated. He flattered his audience by his references to the political and cultural intercourse which the Chinese and Arab Empires had enjoyed in the days of their early greatness and made telling points against Japanese aggression and savagery in China to-day. His scholarship and sincerity raised his lectures far above familiar propaganda and made him an effective advocate of the Allied cause. 6. Iraqi relations with Saudi Arabia were disturbed in early February by the seizure in the Iraqi Customs at Basra of a diplomatic bag brought to Iraq by a Saudi Arabian courier. The Iraqi authorities were slow in dealing with the representations made by the Saudi Legation, and King Abdul Aziz-al-Saud sent an angry message threatening to withdraw his representative unless the bag was immediately released. Having heard of the affair from the Saudi Charge d’Affaires I brought it to the attention of the Prime Minister, who telephoned orders for the bag to be delivered at once to the Saudi Legation. This having been done with apologies, the incident was closed. Shortly afterwards Shukri Qawatli, the Syrian politician, came to Bagdad on his return from the Haj bringing with him messages of goodwill from Ibn Sand to the Iraqi Government, and proposals for the settlement of the outstanding disputes concerning the demarcation of the Saudi-Iraqi frontier and the disposal of the elusive and tiresome Shammar of Najd. The two aide-memoires with which Shukri • Qawatli was furnished amounted to little more than a re-statement of the Saudi claims and a rejection of the proposals for settlement, including neutral arbitration about the frontier, hitherto put forward by the Iraqi Government. They therefore provided no basis for profitable discussions. The indisposition of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, to which I have referred above, delayed the informal talks which Shukri Qawatli wished to have about these matters, and his stay in Bagdad has accordingly been unexpectedly prolonged. 7. The Prime Minister postponed until after the trial of Rashid Ali's associates the further consideration of his plan for Iraq’s adherence to the Washington anti-Axis Pact and the declaration of a state of war between Iraq and Italy and Germany. He informed me, however, that the unfavourable reception which King Abdul Aziz-al-Saud had given to the suggestion that Saudi Arabia should take similar action would not alter his own views. As reported in my telegram No. 477, paragraph 3 (/), I regard this as a question in which both Nuri and ourselves should step very carefully. There is no doubt that Iraq’s participation in the war would be extremely unpopular among the people, and that His Majesty’s Government would be blamed for any consequences, such as enemy bombing, the effect of which on popular morale might well be disastrous Apart from this, neither the General Officer Commanding nor I can see whet practical advantage we would derive from Iraqi belligerency at the present time. 8. Mr. Nouri Isfandiari presented his credentials on the 26th January on appointment as Persian Minister at Bagdad. The last of the Japanese Legation left Bagdad for India on the 22nd February, and the Italian Minister and staff from Jedda passed through Iraq on their way to Turkey a day later. Press comment welcomed what was described as the breaking-off of diplomatic relations between the Saudi Arabian and Italian Governments. 9. Mr. Paul Knabenshue, the United States Minister, died suddenly from tetanus after a minor operation on the 1st February. He was popular with theIraqis and with his colleagues, and the British community held him in high esteem for the asylum which he gave to so many of them in his legation at the time of the troubles of last year. A State funeral was accorded by the Iraqi Government. No successor has yet been appointed. This is regrettable, as Mr. Farrell, the charge d’affaires, does not inspire confidence, while his staff Ij^e much to be desired. 10. Supplies of flour have improved. Nine thousand tons of wheat have been received from British Imperial sources since the beginning of February, and 4,000 tons more are due to arrive at Basra soon. This wheat is all taken over by the Supplies Committee of the Iraqi Government and is sold at a fixed price to the public and to the bakers, in the form of flour. Distribution arrangements in Bagdad have been taken over by the Supplies Committee from the municipality and have been much improved since I last reported. Both bread and flour are now available without unreasonable hardship; though the price of both remains high. In the provinces distribution is still in the hands of the local officials and holders of wheat in the country remain reluctant to sell. An owner of 3,000 tons of wheat near Mosul refused to sell at I.D. 25 a ton, though Mosul town was at that time in grave need of wheat. An acute sugar shortage became apparent about the middle of March and a rationing system at the rate of 1 kilog. per person per month is now being put into operation. The registered stocks of sugar amounting to about 13,000 tons are estimated to be enough to meet the country’s needs for six months. Prices of other commodities, including all kinds of cloth, fell steeply at the beginning of April with news of the arrival of large new' supplies at Basra. 11. To counter the effect of malicious rumours which were being spread abroad that the shortage of supplies was due to the British army’s purchases, I published an official statement on the 31st January assuring the people that the British forces had purchased no wheat, ghee, coffee or tea in Iraq, and w'ere, moreover, directly relieving distress by spending over £30,000 a month on the employment of labour. 12. The current session of Parliament, prolonged for a month from the middle of April, ended on the 14th May. A number of useful but minor amend ments to laws already enacted were passed and the budget was dealt with, without new taxation. The final figures have not yet been published, but as presented to the Chamber it showed estimated revenue at I.D. 6,458,200, and expenditure at I.D. 7,627,633, leaving a deficit of I.D. 1,169,433. Several important measures for the regulation of the economic life of the country, the control of prices, the prevention of h oar ding and the distribution of food-stuffs were also passed. Taxation, it seems to me, remains in some forms at an unduly low level, but here, as elsewhere in the Near and Middle East, the governing classes suffer from a strong reluctance to subject themselves to financial sacrifices. 13. His Royal Highness the Duke of Gloucester arrived in Bagdad from Cairo on the afternoon of the 6th May and remained until the morning of the 8th May. His purpose was to visit the British forces in this country, but he was good enough to find time, in a heavy programme, to meet the Diplomatic Corps and the British community at a garden party at the embassy and to attend a dinner party which the Regent gave at the Qasr Rihab. It was pleasant to see the warmth of the popular applause given to His Royal Highness whenever he drove through the streets of Bagdad and the whole-hearted co-operation of the Iraqi police and army in all arrangements connected with the Duke’s visit was as gratifying as it was significant. 14. In general, I consider that the situation in this country has developed satisfactorily since the date of my last review^, especially when one considers the long series of set-backs suffered by our arms at the hands of the Japanese during this period. At the time of writing there is much speculation over the German offensive thought to be imminent. Should the main thrust be launched against the Caucasus and attain its objective, the repercussions among these volatile people will, of course, be great. But a greater and more sudden deterioration in morale would ensue were the enemy to indulge in some unorthodox venture such as an air-borne attack upon, or landing in, Syria. And the fact that up to date there is apparently no evidence of major concentrations against Russia has led to some discussion here of this possibility. But whatever happens the next few months will hold much of interest and not a little of danger.if 15.

As in the new camp prisoners are divided into three categories, he had immediately ordered the police to degrade every trouble maker to a lower class and to send those of the lowest category to a magistrate so that they might be awarded hard labour. 2.

His Excellency promised to study the list carefully and I will pursue the question with him in a few days time. 2. So far as internal security generally is concerned, I made a particular point after executions and before my departure for Mosul, of impressing upon the Regent and the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs the importance of following up the good effect of firmness shown by the Government. Emphasising the danger of leniency on the eve of possibly critical war developments, I urged the necessity of rounding up all dangerous fifth columnists. 5. Since I returned from the North I have spoken in similar strain to the Prime Minister, Ministry of Finance and Minister of the Interior. The response in each case has been satisfactory and all seemed to appreciate the reality of the danger.‘• Indeed, the Minister of the Interior observed that he had [group undec.: ? entire] authority to intern everyone who might be dangerous at the first sign of outside emergency. 4. We must now see to what extent performance ful fils promise. I do not anticipate that all those figuring in list mentioned in paragraph 1 will be, in practice, de tained; for the time being at any rate I would be satisfied with a decent percentage. One factor that I feel should move in our favour is the realisation on the part of most of the Administration that since the drastic [group undec.: ‘ ? steps] of executions they have burnt their bridges as far as their enemies are concerned.

I returned this morning from a : visit to Kirkuk, Arbil and Mosul, I was very favourably impressed with the situation; in fact, one has to go back at least fifteen years to remember such co-operation and friendliness. The Mutessanfs and other Government officials went out of their way to pay. me honour ; 4 . the Mutessarif of Suleimani and General Officer Commanding 2nd Division came from Suleimani to Kirkuk especially to meet me; at each place I had talks with chief notables many of whom came in from districts to welcome me; at each place I was cordially entertained, 2.

These Lewas are politically friendly and far more interested in their own affairs than in the war. L. As pointed out in my telegram No. 188 Mosul Lewa has suffered from hqving a sickly Mutessarif whose heart was not in his work and a bad Commandant of Police. Both have now been changed. There are several unsatisfactory spots; t (a) *Jebel Sinjar* where Yazidis have been badly handled.

It was, I believe, thanks to this persistent pressure that the Iraqi G-overnment embarked upon preparation of a new and larger camp at Amarah which I hope will be ready for occupation in the immediate future. It will be under direct control of Ministry of Interior, Police, and the local Provincial Representative of the Government instead (as in the ease of FAO) of Ministry of Social Affairs. Prisoners from FAO, Samarra and Sulman are able to be concentrated in this new camp. 2 . Director‘-General of Police confessed to me recently his disgust over the conditions at FAO, He was determined to ensure proper discipline at Amarah. He observed in this connexion that as the new camp will contain a hospital there will be no need for prisoners to seek treatment in Bagdad or Basra. The lack of adequate medical facilities at FAO was of course fully exploited by the prisoners many of whom had nothing wrong within [Sic]. So far as I am aware however, there were no actual escapes. ^3.

This may well mean that a decision is to 5e postponed indefinitely and in any case offers an opportunity for stock-taking. I am well aware of the-valuable' results of your.efforts to bring about a healthier atmosphere in Iraq, but I am sure that you will agree (and indeed' it is clear from the very useful appreciation i n your telegram No. 28B_Lof 16th March]) that the position is still far from satisfactory. This is no doubt partly due to circumstances outside our control, in particular to events in the Far East, but it seems worth considering whether there is anything further, that could and should be done. 2. Iraqi Army seems to be the most important problem. You said in your telegram No.288 th at the Prime Minister was not dissatisfied wlLTi the progress of his purge, but that you did not yourself trust the Army. I assume that after the lesson it had last year it is unlikely to cause any serious trouble in present circumstances, but it seems only too probable that it would seize first opportunity in the event of an-enemy attack to secure its revenged Presumably Prime Minister could not survive any proposal for the total disbandment of the Army, but it is a.question whether we should not try to secure its drastic reduction, say to about 10,000 to 15,000 officers and men (about five Iraqi brigades). I understand that total of 10.000 would be sufficient to cover the roles assigned to it last:November, i. e. defence of the North-East frontier and of the' line of communication .Kirkuk-Bagdad-Basra, and additional 5.000 might perhaps be usefully employed In control of the tribes. If the Army could be reduced .to this extent, it should be easier for it to be concentrated in places where it could do us least harm. It .might in particular be possible to effect substantial reduction in Bagdad garrison, where so much of the trouble has started in the past. POL, DwS' -tMAY1942 INDIA OPWftF 5 ./5. I take it that so far •'••as the men ' are concerned reduction on this scale might be welcome. In' oresent circumstances there should be no difficulty in their securing alternative and more profitable emoloyment..:..-. It -might even be possible to combine reducbion of the Army with the abolition • of conscription, which would surely be popular among the great majority of the Iraqis if the Prime Minister could-only bring himself to take the plunge. - Pffeet among the officers would clearly be unfavourable, even if they were given substantial 5^1 pensions. But it is, arguable that, however ill-disposed, they T^J w °ul&lt;l be less dangerous individually than as members of an ^^S?M or g anised armed force. 4. Fifth Column.

But it is not clear that the Iraqi Government are doing enough. Would it help if special security mission, which might possibly examine the position in neighbouring countries also, were to*be sent to Iraqi What we have in mind is a small expert body of policemen with Eastern experience, under someone like Sir Alexander Keown-Boyd,* if he could be spared; from his present duties in Cairo. We realise that the present difficulty lies not so much in identifying anti-British elements, who are indeed well known to the existing security organisations, but in making sure that the Iraqi authorities will put them under restraint as and when desirable. But it might be useful to have-the whole field surveyed by a body of this kind. We would then know where we stood ana would be in a strong position to press the Iraqi Government to take really drastic action against undesirables without fear or favour. , 5 V Iraqi Government. From ynur clear that Prime Minister should alio'be strongly pressed to improve the level of his government and the administration generally by the inclusion of any well-disposed men of proved ability who;/ban be got to work with him. ~He must need all the help he can get and it is difficult to justify continued &lt; exclusion of men. like Ibrahim Kemal on the score of obscure family feuds. / . ; : , 6 .

'tW l understand that these are particularly pernicious and it is clearly hopeless to expect any real improvement in the attitude of Army officers as. long as their training colleges are under • Strong enemy influence. 7.

Recognition of Syrian Government would not imply any special approval of the personalities who now run the x country and could only improve the prospects of Syrian independence as a whole. Moreover, Ibn Saud recognised Syrian Government unconditionally and it does not seem too much to ask of the Iraqi Government that they should do the same. 8.

At the first two meetings no business was done as a quorum was not present. The recess has passed quietly, and the principal matters of concern have been the cost of living, the trial of Rashid Ali and his associates, the interpretation of certain articles of the Organic Law and the review of Iraq’s position in the war. 2. Places of essential articles show little improvement. Maximum prices for matches, tea, coffee, sugar, wheat and barley and certain grades of cotton goods have been fixed by the Central Supply Board, but merchants are generally selling only low quality stocks at the fixed prices. The better quality is obtainable at a higher price by private arrangements. The price of the best quality wheat was fixed early in January at I.D. 40 a ’teghar, and the lowest quality (with 15 per cent, of dirt) at I.D. 34. The price of flour has, however, remained uncontrolled and has now exceeded I.D. 3 per 100 kilog. This is a very high price for the poor to pay. In Bagdad the mayor endeavoured to organise the sale of restricted quantities at a lower price. He was obliged, however, to give up the experiment as he found that without rationing it was impossible to prevent abuses. He is now trying to organise adequate supplies of controlled-price bread instead, but is confronted with the difficulty of having a stock of wheat only big enough to last until the end of February. 3. A British expert is now helping the Iraqi authorities to solve their supply and distribution problems, but so far as can be judged from the available information it will be impossible to find enough grain to feed the people in the towns unless a large quantity can be imported from abroad. Such supplies can only be obtained through the good offices of His Majesty’s Government and I have in several telegrams represented to you, Sir, the gravity of the situation which will arise if wheat is not speedily made available for this country. The people in villages and settled tribal areas have, generally speaking, enough foodstuffs to keep them alive until the next harvest, but in the towns there are thousands of families who had not money enough to lay in supplies in advance for the winter and who are dependent for their daily bread on small purchases. The steady rise in the price of flour and all other foodstuffs has hit these people hard, and if adequate supplies within their means fail they will be faced with starvation. 4. The result of the trial by court-martial of Rashid Ali and his associates was published on the 8th January. Rashid Ali, Ali Mahmud al Sheikh Ali, Yunis Sabawi, Salahud Din Sabbagh, Fahmi Said and Mahmud Salman were sentenced to be hanged. Amin Zaki was also sentenced to death, but the sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. Naji Shaukat was sentenced to 15 years’ ^imprisonment, Siddiq Shanshal to 5 years’ imprisonment and Muhammad Hasan Salman to 1 year’s imprisonment. The court also ordered the confiscation of the property of all the above-mentioned persons. The court further decided to postpone the hearing of the charges made against Naji Suwaidi, Mohammed Ali Muhmud, Musa Shahbandar, Rauf Bahrani, Kamil' Shabib and Abdul Qadir Gilani until such time as they should be able to appear before the court, the court having been satisfied that these persons had wished to respond to the court’s summons to surrender themselves for trial, but had been prevented from doing so by circumstances outside their control. 5. As you are aware, the actual position of the accused persons is that Rashid Ali is in Berlin, Naji Shaukat and Muhammad Hasan Salman are in Turkey, while the remainder, with the exception of Salahud Din Sabbagh whose whereabouts are unknown, are on their way to Southern Rhodesia for internment [27—49] RECd. POL. DEPt. d0iVIAR,9422 m- 6. On the 20th January the Iraqi Government made a formal written application for the surrender of all of the above-mentioned persons who are now in the hands of His Majesty’s Government (except Abdul Qadir Gilani, who is charged with a minor offence). The Prime Minister informed me orally that the Cabinet resolution to take this step had been passed unanimously and that it had at the same time been resolved that if any of these men were acquitted after their return to Iraq they should be interned at Fao. 7. 1 he Prime Minister confessed to me privately, however, that he was doubtful of the wisdom of giving full effect at once to the Cabinet’s resolution, and I agreed with his view that it would be better to have back first those who had been sentenced and to let the others come later on if the situation continued to be favourable. I have, therefore, as you are already aware from my tolopo-am —AH proposed that Ali Mahmud al Sheikh Ali, Yunis Sabawi, Amin Zaki Sulaiman, Fahmi Said, Mahmud Salman and Siddiq Shanshal shall be surrendered as soon as possible, while the others are detained for a while in South Africa. 8. Since the announcement of the sentences I have made careful enquiries throughout the country into the state of public feeling regarding the handing over of the convicted men and the execution of their sentences. Reports show that there has been a considerable hardening of opinion against these men during the last month and that no serious trouble is expected as the result of such action’ 9. In para graph 10 of my despatch No. 349 of the 14th December, 1 mentioned the Prime Minister's declared wish to strengthen the authority of Parliament. During the recent parliamentary recess he has been examining possi bilities of doing this within the framework of the Organic Law. The High Court (consisting of four senators and 4 judges) provided for in article 3 of the Organic Law has been called upon to reply to the following questions touching the interpretation of articles 20 and 22 of the Constitution :— (1) Would the addition of certain rights to the established rights of the King during the period of regency be an infringement of the King’s prerogatives ? (2) If the male descendants in direct line to his late Majesty King Faisal should cease, can a female descendant in the direct line become heir to the Throne ? and. if not, would it be within the rights of the nation to settle this matter ? (3) Would the creation of the post of Deputy or Assistant Minister, to be held by a Member of Parliament, be contrary to the Constitution ? 10. The following decisions were given by the High Court:— (1) The grant of new rights to the King would not contravene article 22 of the Organic Law. This article forbids the modification of the King’s prerogatives during a regency. The assignment of additional rights to the King would not be a modification within the meaning of this article. (2) A female cannot succeed to the Throne, and if. which God forbid, there should be no male heir to the Throne, the decision to be taken would rest with the nation under article 19. (3) The creation of the post of Deputy or Assistant Minister from amoim Members of Parliament is not lawful, for it would weaken the legislative power. (The underlying idea of this somewhat ambiguous decision seems to be that if each Minister could appoint a deputy or assistant the influence of the Cabinet over the Senate and the Chamber would he much increased because of the powerful patronage which the Cabinet would thereby control within the two Houses.) 11. Questions concerning articles 55, 31 and 119 of the Organic Law have also been referred to the High Court for interpretation. 12. The Organic Law itself is meanwhile being studied by a special committee with a view to the elimination, by amendment, of the defects which have been revealed by experience. The committee consists of twelve members ex-ministers and judges, under the presidency of Jamil Madfai. 13. Reports which have reached me from political advisers and other sources show that there are still too many pro-Nazis and anti-British Iraqi civil officials and army officers at large in the northern liwas. Most of them appearI 3 to be inactive at present, but they represent a potentially hostile element, and I snail continue to make strong representations to the Prime Minister for their removal. 1 am also pressing for action against a number of undesirable teachers and officials who still remain undisturbed in the Ministry of Education * ini its various schools. It is impossible to deal with all those persons who showed fostmty when Nazi influence was in the ascendant, but in spite of the fact that too many remain untouched, there is no doubt that the general political atmosphere in the country has greatly improved. Co-operation between the 1 Jontisn and Iraqi forces is excellent, and social intercourse is encouraged by the * igher command on each side. A joint Anglo-Iraqi survey of certain features of the desert area south of the Euphrates, between Jalal Tanf and Ramadi. is now being carried out, and the Mosul Municipality have given their new town hall for use as a service club for British troops. 14. 1 he 1 rime Minister has been thinking a good deal lately about Iraq’s position m the war. From the beginning he has had faith in an Allied victorv, and has seen clearly that Iraq could expect few positive benefits from such a victory unless she played, in some measure, an active part in the fight against nazism. While those who believed in a Nazi victory favoured reinsurance with the Keich, Nun Said has always inclined towards the building up of a substantial credit account with the Allies, on which Iraq could cash in when the time came for peace settlements, i his was the basis of his early schemes for a token Iraqi xoice m the western desert, and though political and military opposition to such a project was too strong for him, he has never given up the hope of finding some wa\ of improving Iraq’s position at the peace conference bv finding a part for her to play in the war. He quickly appreciated the importance for the Arab counti les (especially Iraq, Syria and Palestine) of the Atlantic Charter, and more recently he has seen the opportunity which is offered by the twenty-six Power anti-Axis pact concluded at Washington at the beginning of the year. He has accordingly been sounding his colleagues and some of the senior politicians now out of office, with a view to obtaining their agreement to Iraq’s adherence to this pact and the concurrent declaration of a state of war between Iraq and Italy and Germany. He no doubt feels that Iraq’s ultimate claims to the rioffits and privileges recognised by the Atlantic Charter will thereby be strengthened. He may also hope that if Iraq signs the pact the United States mav extend the Lease-Lend Act to her. He would like Saudi Arabia to take the same step at the same time, but he is awaiting the advice of His Majesty’s Government before making any proposals to King Ibn Saud. 15. Iraq s position vis-a-vis Syria has also been under consideration, and. as you already know, the Prime Minister informed me about the middle of January that the Iraqi Government would be willing to recognise the Syrian and Lebanese Governments if the Free French authorities announced that the present arrangements are only temporary and that at the end of the war the Syrian and Lebanese will be free to choose what form of government shall be set up in their respective countries. 16. The French Minister, his family and the legation staff left Iraq at the end of December. The remainder of the Japanese Legation staff remained pending a decision as to the route to be chosen for their repatriation and arrange ments for the release of British diplomatists in Japanese hands. All Japanese property in Iraq was brought under official control soon after the Japanese declaration of war on the United States. 17. The Iraqi Government have under consideration a draft Treaty of Friendship with China. The Prime Minister informs me that this does not involve an exchange of diplomatic missions. 18.

The Prime Minister is active in countering this and other dangers. He has recently interned twenty-four dismissed ^officers and nineteen civilians and more are to follow. At his request our military authorities are helping to construct intern ment camp near Zubair for one thousand persons. 6. Unfortunately several prominent Iraqis whom we believe to be hostile are his friends, and he will believe no wrong of them in spite of my warnings. I have urged our authorities to use every endeavour to obtain proof against them. There are undoubtedly too many people being protected by high authorities for such reasons as relationship and friendship and though they are at present quiet they constitute a potential danger to which I am fully alive. , 7. In spite of this the Prime Minister and the Cabinet are co-operating with us extremely well, and with a few exceptions holders of key posts throughout tne country are favourable to us. We are therefore fighting hostile subversive activities with free hand and in co-operation with the Government while the enemy has to work in fear of arrest. 8. The- Cabinet appears to be united on the major Questions but with two exceptions Ministers are not individually strong and personal differences exist which might at any time flare- np into sudden crisis. The Prime Minister assures me at the moment they are working^well together with the exception of the newly- i appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs who is a coward* 9. Naturally, after years of German propaganda there are many pro-Nazis in Iraq and agitators; timid waverers will veer towards them as the war appears to go against us. As is always the case in this country unpleasant possibilities exist and the situation may at any time unexpectedly change but at present I do not regard it with alarm. The enemy will doubtless intensify his subversive activities but.we too hold good cards and are not inactive. Test will come if there is a German advance in this direction and I cannot yet foretell what will happen in such a contingency.

I HAVE the honour to transmit to you herewith a copy of a despatch from His Majesty’s Consul, in which he gives an account of events in his consular district from the beginning of April to the end of October. 2. It will be seen that during the months of April and May, in particular. Mr. Finch was confronted with a variety of difficult situations, the successful handling of which testifies to his resourcefulness and devotion to duty. 3. I trust, therefore, that you will authorise me to convey to Mr. Finch your appreciation of the excellent work done by him at a time when, without any contact with the outside world, he was daily called upon to meet situations of heavy responsibility and often of personal danger. I have, &amp;c. KINAHAN CORNWALLIS. Consul Finch to Sir Kinahan Cornwallis. Confidential.) 4&gt;.o (No. 45. Sir, Mosul, November 30, 1941.

(Confidential.) Re/port on Events in Mosul District, April-October 1941. Prelude. 1 . On the night of 3rd or 4th April, 1941 (records are now destroyed), Tahsin Ali, Mutessarif of Mosul, was removed more or less under duress to Bagdad by order of Rashid Ali, and was replaced by Brigadier Qasim Maqsud, of the Iraq army, previously stationed at Kirkuk, as acting mutessarif and District Commander at Mosul. The real military commander, Colonel Abdur Razzaq Hussein, had gone to Bagdad for a horse show, and was prevented from returning. 2. During the same night in which Tahsin Ali was removed, I received a telegram from His Majesty’s Ambassador instructing me to convey his Excellency’s personal greetings to the mutessarif and to inform him that the Regent was forming a Government at Basra which would have the full support of His Majesty’s Government. Early in the morning, when I requested an inter view with the mutessarif, I was met with evasive answers, and finally went to the mutessarifiyah, demanded an interview on the spot, and was told that the mutessarif had “gone to Bagdad.” I was then met with evasion when I enquired who was acting during his absence, but was finally told that Brigadier Qasim Maqsud was in charge. It was then necessary to decide how far the ambassador’s message was for “ the mutessarif ” (as worded) and how far for Tahsin Ali. Obviously, the personal greeting was for Tahsin Ali, but, in view of the decisive effect that a firm, independent attitude by the District Commander at Mosul had had at the time of Bekir Sidqi’s assassination in 1937, I judged that a statement of His Majesty’s Government’s attitude might have a good effect on whoever was in charge here, and that the statement must be made immediately, before any opposing influences got to work. To communicate with Bagdad by telephone was impossible; the lines were blocked by the Government, [25—28] RECo. POL. BE Ft, 3QJAN 942 INDIA OFFICE ENCLOSE IN WEEKLY LETTER No. 6 J7 FEB 1942 FROM SECRETARY, EXTERNAL DEPT., INDIA OFFICE2 Telegrams were subject to inordinate delay and mutilation. Therefore, I interviewed Qasim Maqsud, and gave him the second part of the ambassador’s message. He replied that he was under the orders of Bagdad, and could “ make no answer. I said that I did not require an answer; I was merely telling him something I considered it important for him to know. Qasim Maqsud was not a^ man of sufficient character to take the independent line T had hoped for, bu^) throughout April and May he was, by all evidence, a very unhappy man, inwardly convinced that Rashid Ali had aroused an opponent whom he could not withstand. Differences of opinion among his own officers, latent opposition among the notables of Mosul, and lack of sympathy among the tribes of the north were primarily responsible for Qasim Maqsud’s conviction. 3. During the remainder of the month instructions were received con- cerning the possible rapid evacuation of British women and children and concentration and/or evacuation of the males. Until the occupation of Syria and Persia by friendly forces Mosul was awkwardly placed for evacuation, except to Bagdad. It is hemmed round with frontiers. The Turkish frontier is an inhospitable one in this region, and the road to it presents difficulties. The road to the Persian frontier lies through mountainous country unsuitable for women and children in time of disorder. Syria meant internment for British males of military age, but internment might be preferable to danger to life and limb in Iraq. Ihe most satisfactory route seemed via Baiji and the pipe-line to Trans jordan. For evacuation of women and children, it was decided to use the railway via Syria and Turkey to Palestine; for any general evacuation, the pipe-lme to Transjordan. It was fortunate that in the event the latter route was not used, except for the evacuation by air of the B.O.D. Company’s women and children, for attacks on the pumping stations broke out at the very outset of hostilities. 4. Experience proved that voluntary evacuation and local secrecy, to avoid causing alarm, are objects that cannot together be attained. The poorer British subjects will not move without good reason given, and the better-to-do in Mosul, whose morale was excellent, did not see any reason to stir, in the sultry calm that prevailed in April, until I had strained to the breaking-point my instructions on the subject of secrecy. Evacuation. 5. Between 11 a.m. and noon on Tuesday, the 29th April, His Majesty’s Ambassador’s telegram was received, containing instructions that British women and children should leave Iraq, but not via Bagdad, and that assistance in this sense should be given to an American family in Mosul. The north-bound Taurus ex pi ess left Mosul that day at 2 ‘SO p.m. Most of the English women and children were got on board, thanks to the helpful attitude of the French and Turkish Consuls; certain of them, owing to delay caused by the Iraqi passport authorities, had to chase the train in cars as far as Tel Hugenah. This left four British families and one American, who for various reasons—mainly passport complications—could not, or would not, go by that day’s train. The'wives and children of the scattered British Indians and British subjects of local denizen- ship were mostly of local origin, and were not of a kind to be launched without their menfolk on a journey through foreign territory. Although a number of the men were later rounded up and interned in the consulate, these local families remained unharmed in the town through the subsequent troubles. 6. It was not until between 1 and 2 p.m. on the 29th April that His Majesty’s Ambassador’s decision could be telephoned to the B.O.D. Company at Qaiyarah. The authorities had practically monopolised the telephones and all calls were made with great difficulty. The B.O.D. Company had independent arrangements for evacuating their women and children. 7 At about 7 p.m. on Wednesday, the 30th April, another telegram from His Majesty s Ambassador arrived, announcing that males in Bagdad were beine concentrated. Although Mosul town was quiet, and the only unwholesome signs were police control of movement on the roads and great difficulty in communica tions (it proved impossible to get through to Qaiyarah or Ain Zalah that evening) it was decided to collect everyone in the consulate and the British houses in its immediate vicinity, to ask the authorities for a police cordon round the area and to broach with them the question of providing a safe-conduct to the frontier, if and when this should be asked for. All available British and Americans were accordingly brought into the concentration area, and at 9 p.m. I interviewed267 3 Brigadier Qasim Maqsud. The interview was friendly; he immediately provided the police cordon, and promised, after demanding a certain amount of explana tion, to give police escort to the Syrian or Transjordan frontier if required. At first he wished to limit this to the Syrian frontier, but I insisted on leaving open the alternative of sending a convoy via Baiji and the Haifa pipe-line, and he ^ ^finally agreed. It had been necessary, before approaching Qasim Maqsud, to decide how far we should take the authorities into our confidence and how far endeavour to present them with a fait accompli. It was decided that, since they had our communications so readily at their mercy and were already watching them, and since the supreme danger in Mosul itself was likely to be mob violence, we would do better to demand their co-operation and emphasise their responsibility. 8 . On Thursday, the 1 st May, there was another north-bound Taurus express, hut by this time I judged that, rather than send the remaining women and children away by that route, it would be better to send the whole British and American communities of Mosul and the B.O.U. by motor convoy direct to Transjordan, leaving behind only those males whose presence was indispensable. By this time there was only one means of telephoning to Qaiyarah or Ain Zalah : to obtain communication by order of the District Commander. During that morning I was able, by speaking from the Iraq air force headquarters in the hearing of an officer, to ring up Qaiyarah and Ain Zalah. inform them of our intention, and ask them to assemble all but the indispensable to join the Mosul convoy at Qaiyarah. In return, I learnt that the B.O.D. women and children had been safely got away from Qaiyarah (there were only males at Ain Zalah) by car to K. 3 pumping station; but that a number of males, and much of the required transport, had accompanied them thither, and were not expected back at Qaiyarah until the evening of the 1 st May. '9. In the course of April a desert track had been reconnoitred linking Qaiyarah with Ain Zalah via Adaiyah (Sheet 137/L: S.E., square 21), thus short-circuiting Mosul; and another from Mosul to Adaiyah enabling Qaiyarah or Ain Zalah to be reached without using the main exits of the town. The former of these tracks proved very useful during the critical days. 10. During the evening of the 1 st May arrived the last telegram that we were destined to receive from His Majesty’s Embassy. This stated that relations with Iraq were extremely strained, and instructed me to hand over my consulate to my Turkish colleague if subsequently instructed to do so, but to take no initiative in this matter unless I received such instructions. On receipt of this message (which was answered by the conventional acknowledgments to Bagdad and to the Foreign Office) I fixed 9-30 a.m. on the following morning for the departure of the evacuation convoy, and obtained Qasim Maqsud’s promise of a police escort to the frontier. 11 . But at 9-30 on Friday, the 2nd May. events elsewhere had overtaken us. When the police escort arrived, it was found to have instructions to go only as far as Qaiyarah. I accordingly went with Mr. Ditchburn, Land Settlement Officer, to see Qasim Maqsud. He informed us that the situation had changed since his promise of the previous evening, that relations between His Majesty’s Government and Iraq had been severed, that His Majesty’s Ambassador had left the British Embassy (whither, he could not say), and that all British subjects were to be held as prisoners at the Ghazlani (Tank Hill) Camp. I questioned the truth of his statement about the departure of His Majesty’s Ambassador, stating that it was customary, when diplomatic relations were severed, for a representative to hand over his affairs to a neutral colleague and to instruct his consuls to do the same; that I had received no such instructions, though they might he on their way to me; that I expected my consular privileges to be recognised. Qasim Maqsud replied that, while other British subjects must remain, he would recognise me as consul for twelve hours, by which he meant that within that time I might leave the country. I declined to leave unless so instructed by my ambassador. Before we could protest against the intention to intern civilians in a military barracks, Qasim Maqsud was called to the telephone ’ to speak with Bagdad, and he returned to say that orders had been changed; we were to be interned for the time being in the consulate. We had scarcely returned to the consulate to report on these new developments when a military guard arrived and was posted round the building. All cars assembled for the convoy, which could be accommodated inside, were withdrawn into the compound Between forty and fifty persons were now in the consulate. [25—28] b 24 Qaiyarah and Ain Zalah. 12. While the foregoing events were taking place in Mosul the following occurred in the out-stations of the B.O.L). Company :— 13. On receipt of my telephone message on the 29th April, the Fields Manager at Qaiyarah got into communication with Kirkuk and Haifa and set^ in motion the company’s evacuation plan for women and children. Three Iraq Petroleum Company aeroplanes were to pick them up at Qaiyarah aerodrome (2 miles from the camp) on the morning of the 1 st May. The discovery on the evening of the 30th April that all telephone communication outside Qaiyarah had been cut put the company’s officials on their guard, and they decided to move their convoy out of Qaiyarah camp that night, to camp in the desert a certain distance aw^ay and return early next morning to the aerodrome, which lies out of sight of the camp. Scarcely had they moved out when the police sent a man to the camp and posted him in the telephone exchange, so it was evident that all movement was being watched. Calculating that they would watch Qaiyarah aerodrome and might interfere with the movement of the aeroplanes on the morrow, the company’s official in charge at Qaiyarah camp sent out one messenger to the convoy, warning them not to return to the aerodrome, but to proceed to K. 3 (Haditha), and another—a wireless operator—to K. 2 (Baiji) to tell K. 3, out of hearing of the Qaiyarah police, to keep the aeroplanes there. The convoy accordingly proceeded to K. 3 by desert track via Hatra and Dhuw'aisaii. Because of patches of boggy ground, they did not reach K. 3 until 5-20 p.m. on the 1 st May; but the aircraft located the convoy during the day, landed on the desert, and took off the first batch of women and children. Two more plane-loads were flown off that evening after arrival at K. 3, and the last lot were taken off on the following morning, the 2 nd May. 14. Meanwhile, in Qaiyarah events were as follows : The company wireless staff had put a set into operation in a building apart from the main exchange, in which police were posted. They were thus able to pick up news of the safe arrival of the party at K. 3. Telephone communication with Mosul and Ain Zalah was officially disallowed; wireless communication with Ain Zalah was complicated by the fact that the operator at the latter station was not an Englishman, and it was not considered desirable to discuss certain matters by that means. I was able (paragraph 8 ) by direct approach to Qasim Maqsud to put through calls to Qaiyarah and Ain Zalah, and Ain Zalah managed by similar invocation of authority to put through a direct call to Qaiyarah. As a result of this exchange of information, all but tw T o of the foreign staff at Ain Zalah were sent to Qaiyarah by the Adaiyah route, and a wise decision was made to send Mr. Maxwell, the company’s accountant, to Mosul to draw funds to pay the wages of the labourers for April. Both at Qaiyarah and Ain Zalah they were showing signs of restlessness. Mr. Maxwell effected this mission, and returned to Qaiyarah with a large amount of cash during the early afternoon. ' 15. On the 2 nd May the local staffs, both at Qaiyarah and Ain Zalah, picked up news from the Bagdad broadcast of the outbreak of fighting at Habbaniyah. This caused great fear among the Christian clerks, and increased the restlessness of the labourers, but strenuous efforts on the part of the remaining foreign staff at both camps, and the assistance of Sheikh Mishan at Qaiyarah, ensured that no incident occurred. Mr. Maxwell managed to slip out of Qaiyarah camp for Ain Zalah with the pay, and, thanks to the use of the Adaiyah track, he was not intercepted at Mosul. His arrival at Ain Zalah at 6 p.m. saved what was becoming an increasingly ugly situation for Messrs. Wade and McQuaid, the two company officers remaining there. The police had already arrived on the scene and instructed them to quit the camp and proceed to Mosul for internment, and their argument that the coolies, if they saw them departing before pay arrived, would probably set upon them and cause a riot, though it did not move the police, appealed to the common sense of the Mudir Nahiyah of Zummar long enough for the pay car to be sighted on the road. The labour was paid, and Messrs. Maxwell, Wade and McQuaid were brought in to the Mosul Consulate late on the evening of the 2nd May. 16. The Assistant Commandant of the Mosul Police arrived during the afternoon of the 2 nd May at Qaiyarah and removed the foreign staff of the B.O.D. and Mr. Giles, Permanent Way Inspector of the Iraq Railways at Qaiyarah station. They were brought into the consulate a few hours before the party from Ain Zalah.5 17. Having seen off the last aeroplane from K. 3 on the morning of the 2nd May, the B.O.D. desert party prepared to return to Qaiyarah. But, before they set off, K. 3 station picked up the news that K. 2 had been occupied, and all communications eastward of K. 3 appeared to be broken. Next they learnt that, to the westward, H. 3 had been attacked and that Rutbah had been suirounded and the tanks fired. Later came a signal from Qaiyarah that so far (2 P-M-) r . 1D “ visitors ” had arrived. They therefore decided to make for Qaiyarah via Dhuwaisan and Hatra. K. 3 and Haditha village lie on the right bank of the Euphrates; it was therefore necessary to cross the river by the Blondin ferry to get to Qaiyarah. Just as the last of the convoy had crossed, a message was telephoned over from Iv. 3 that Qaiyarah had been occupied, ihe fields managei, Mr. Heseldin, recrossed to K. 3 to get further and fuller information and to obtain money; the remainder, under cover of the hills on the left bank, debated the possibility of making for Syria. At this juncture (5 p.m.) K. 3 was occupied by police, and Mr. Heseldin and the K. 3 staff were taken prisoners to Haditha. The party on the opposite bank understood what had gone wrong when they tried to telephone K. 3 from the ferry. To get to Syria now via the Tripoli pipe-line or the Anah-Abu Kemal route was now impossible, for both meant recrossing to the right bank. It was decided that before risking a journey to Syria through uncertain tribal country on the left bank it would be better to return to the neighbourhood of Qaiyarah and get under cover of the friendly Shammar with whom the company had always worked. This course would also enable them to get into contact with the rest of the company’s staff, if they were still at Qaiyarah, and, if things went well, to pick up clothing and money. 18. They spent the night in the desert 76 miles from K. 3, and continued at dawn of the 3rd' May to Hibbarah, some 23 miles west of Qaiyarah. Here they halted and sent in their Shammar guide to find Sheikh Mishan. The guide returned in the evening to say that he had been unable to speak to the sheikh and that Qaiyarah camp had been evacuated. So they camped for the night at Hibbarah. . 19. On the morning of the 4th May the Shammar sent them an invitation to come to their tents at Jawan, which they accepted. When they reached Jawan news of events in Qaiyarah and Mosul imparted by the Shammar determined them to make for Syria; but as soon as this intention transpired the Shammar created difficulties, and it is possible that the tribesmen did not intend to let them out of their hands. In the afternoon, just as the party, having spent most of the day in negotiations and messages to and from Sheikh Mishan, weie prepai ing to accept the inevitable and go to Qaiyarah under Shammar protection, two cai-loads of police arrived, headed by the Mudir of the Shorah (Hammam Alii) Nahiyah, the party were arrested at revolver-point, and the Shammar weie dii\en off by the police. For a moment it looked as if the police and tribesmen were going to have 20. The party were taken to Mosul in the charge of the Mudir Nahiyah. On arrival in the evening they were driven round the main streets of the town and halted opposite the principal coffee-houses tor display to the assembled populace At 3 o’clock that afternoon (the 4th May) the first British air raid had taken place over Mosul, and it is thought that this was staged to produce a counterblast. Some of the populace were persuaded that these were British prisoners of war. There was a great deal of hand-clapping, some shouting and some spitting, but no dangerous demonstration. 1 he C.I.D. police officer, Amm Zaki, rode in the front car, insisted on the inside light being turned on to display the occupants, and made hand-clapping motions to show the crowd what they \yei e expected to do. At about 7 p.m. the party were brought to the British Consulate. 21 . The adventures of the desert convoy have been tieated somewhat lengthily because (a) they show the stages by which direct action by the authorities spread over the outlying parts of North-West Iraq and down the pipe-lines on the 2 nd May and the following days, and how the Mosul e\acuation convoy that was to have left the consulate on the 2 nd May would probably have fared had it ever left; (b) they are those of an unarmed party at large in tribal territory during the first three days of hostilities; (c) they indicate the parts played by the Shammar, the Mudir Nahiyah of Shorah (lewfiq Shabib, brother of Colonel Kamil Shabib of the “Golden Square”), and Police Officer Amm Zaki. Another of Tewfiq Shabib’s exploits is recounted in paragraph 54. He has since been suspended from duty for five years. Amin Zaki has been stellenbosched to Zibar.6 A rbil. 22. Mr. Gallagher, of the Irrigation Department, who was drilling a water well near Arbil, was recalled to Bagdad by his department a few days before the outbreak of trouble. The party of British and Indian surveyors working on an irrigation project at Bekhmeh, north-east of Arbil, were taken by the authorities to Kirkuk for internment. Internment. 23. On Friday, the 2nd May, all cyphers, secret documents and confidential archives were destroyed. During the day I tried to get telephone communication with the acting mutessarif (Qasim Maqsud) and with my consular colleagues, but was refused all communication. 24 Our numbers were swelled by the arrivals of the B.O.D. parties mentioned above, and by various British subjects, Indian employees of the railways, &amp;c., who were rounded up and brought into the consulate on the first days of the month. In no cases were the wives and families of these persons brought in, and a few, though not all, local Indian Moslem males were left undisturbed in Mosul throughout the rebellion. In spite of the formidable number thus gathered in the precincts, it was not thought advisable to refuse admittance, since it was felt that they might otherwise be ill-treated or confined in a military area, subject to bombardment, or else that, if we made difficulties, we might all be moved to some place whei'e we might have very much less control over our living amenities, rationing and sanitation. In two cases, however, we objected. The first was an ex-British subject who had taken Iraqi nationality. The authorities declared that they had cancelled his naturalisation, and that he therefore reverted to his British nationality (an error we believed to be a product of genuine imbecility). We resisted his entry for twenty-four hours, after which we ceded under protest, lest he be maltreated. The second was an Indian family, one of whose members was clearly suffering from throat trouble of an infectious sort. 25. Our muster-roll at its maximum reached 99, of whom 17 were 1 Americans, 1 French, 5 Lebanese, 1 Polish, .the remainder British. There were -j 8 women and 19 children. With the pro-consul (Iraqi), one eavass, a gatekeeper fi and my personal servants, this made over 100 souls. 26. Three of the Americans had at first been interned at Kirkuk with the staff of the Iraq Petroleum Company. Later they had been allowed to remain under surveillance in a hotel in Kirkuk, where they were allowed the use of their wireless receiver. They had finally secured a promise from the Mutessarif of Kirkuk, Dr. Faik Shakir, that they could leave the country via Tel Kotchek. On arrival at Mosul on the 28th May they were detained and brought into this consulate. They brought us three weeks’ world news, and the first tidings of the capture of Fellujah and the British advance on Bagdad. Only those who have been deprived of information against their will for three weeks will realise what this surge of news meant. 27. We had some good organisers among us, and the problems of messing, sanitation, water supply, washing and laundering were successfully solved. The general morale of the community was exceedingly high; so high, in fact, that the principal anxiety was lest some exuberance should produce an incident. Such a misfortune did not occur. The question of defence was considered, and certain ■ measures were decided on in case of need. We bore in mind that possibility that the collapse of the rebellion might lead to anarchy before any friendly troops [ could arrive, in which case a mob attack on the consulate was an event for which ; a deplorable precedent in 1939 existed. We were not in a position to do more than i sell our lives dearly rather than cheaply, if we had to sell them; but this we were determined to do. 28. During the first few days contact at the gate with servants and clerks outside was possible, and people were allowed to send for bedding, clothes, cooking- stoves. stores, &amp;c. Later there was more restriction, any servant allowed out was forbidden to return, and the sole comer and goer was the ration contractor. We did not lack funds, as supplies of cash had been drawn by the consulate and several individuals on the eve of the rebellion, and the B.O.D. in particular had provided several thousand dinars. 29. My position as consul was in very important respects completely in abeyance, as far as its recognition by the authorities was concerned, but I7 TJ-Z endeavoured to maintain it where possible. A certain number of written representations were made ; these were sent by me, or under cover of a letter by me, over my official seal and signature, addressed to “ the acting mutessarif,” who de facto was Qasim Maqsud. No written, but some oral, replies were received through the officer of the guard. One piece of consular business they found it r,o A their interest to maintain. Some I.D. 1,200 were due to Iraqis in the form of deposits for Palestine visas. A number of depositors were brought from time to time to the consulate to claim repayment. This gave me a slight hold. Deposits were repaid (by cheque) against the customary formalities, and I let it be understood that these refunds might in certain circumstances cease. None of the cheques were paid by the bank until after the armistice. 30. The French Consul secured the release on the 7th May of one Frenchman and three Lebanese of the B.O.I). staff. The Americans repeatedly demanded in writing that they should be released, and be allowed to communicate with their minister and to leave the country. No attention was paid to their demand for communication with their minister. At first it seemed that they would be allowed to leave, for on the 5th May the senior of them was permitted to go out and take their passports to the French and Turkish Consulates to apply for visas. It was thus that my colleagues learnt authentically of the situation in the consulate, and that my French colleague learnt of the internment of his ressortissants. I had been unable to communicate this. The French and Turkish Consuls made representations to Brigadier Qasim Maqsud and to their legations in Bagdad concerning the inhumanity of confining so many people in a restricted space. I should add that the attitude of M. Cassin and M. Guvenir during the evacuation, the internment and afterwards was consistently friendly and helpful. The Persian Consul was friendly, but did not have the same occasions for being of assistance. All consulates were kept under close police supervision. 31. From the 18th May onwards certain inmates were “ released.” That is to say, their families were instructed to apply for them, and their removal from the consulate was ordered. 1 wo or three who so departed were Indians, who were not further molested. The pro-consul, who was removed on this | pretext much against his will and my own objections, was very shortly arrested, | and his father was made to sign a bond of I.D. 200 that his son would sever all 1 connexion with the consulate. 32. The American representations came to nothing. No reason was given, and it was not until after the armistice that we learnt what must have been the cause : the sheltering of British subjects by the United States Minister in Bagdad. 33. On the morning of the 3rd May the officer of the military guard informed me that the flag must be lowered, as its display might be a provocation to the populace. Knowing the evil reputation of the Mosul mob, and the fact that, if it suited them, the authorities had only to breathe a hint and in half an hour a crowd could be got to attack the consulate and “ overcome ” any guard, it was judged prudent to swallow this affront under protest, and the flag was lowered. It was laid flat on the roof during the first air raids for the informa tion of the Royal Air Force. The consideration mentioned above underlay our acceptance of a number of humiliations during the month, and should be borne in mind throughout the narrative; there were women and children in the building. 34. Next the surrender of my wireless set was demanded. I pointed out that it was only a receiver; nevertheless, it was demanded and surrendered. Then the telephone instruments were removed. 35. The managers of the Eastern and Ottoman banks were informed that they must hand over their keys and duties. They requested and obtained written instructions, and were taken off (in the back of a pick-up), under escort of two soldiers, to Brigadier Qasim Maqsud. in whose presence they handed over their keys to their senior local staff. 36. On the 6 th May Rais Awal Yunis Ali demanded the keys of the B.O.D Company’s safes from Mr. Maxwell. Six keys were given, for which a receipt was taken. Messrs. Maxwell, Rooke and Bennett were taken to Qaiyarah that day by this officer, to hand over the camp. They observed that on the 6 th May the Shammar guards were still on duty and that the camp appeared intact On the 7th May, before they returned to the consulate, they saw the Shammar removed and the Iraqi army installed in the camp. It is* clear from this and other evidence that the considerable destruction and looting that took place at Qaiyarah were primarily done by the military.37. At noon on the 3rd May a party of police arrived and searched the consulate and the personal effects of all persons therein. I hey did notappeai to be interested in money (of which a very considerable sum was stored in one safe). The object of this perquisition seems to have been arms, ammunition, means of communication, and motor vehicles. All objects in these categories which were observed were taken. The confiscated articles were made ovei attei ^9 elaborate listing to a military officer who had joined the party dm ing the proceedings. „ 38. A compact and useful little radio, packed up among the clothes ot one of the inmates, escaped notice. This set became very useful, for it was our last link with the world of reliable new r s. The local press had already begun to pour out a stream of “stop press’ handbills of the Iraq army s fantastic communiques concerning the fighting at Habbaniyah. I persuaded the owner to hand the set over to me and to keep a discreet silence as to it’s existence. It was concealed in a waterproof bag in a bath-room, and the room was used at appropriate night hours behind locked doors as a listening-post to Palestine and the B.B.C. The news, and the fact that I was getting it, were disclosed to only a small number of discreet persons, because ( 1 ) we had reason to suspect that the sentries pumped the semi-Iraqi British subjects in our midst, and probably also the servants, ( 2 ) not everybody in a community of a hundred can be counted on for discretion. 39. The listening-post did not last beyond the 8 th May, when a second and more severe search was made, this time by military officers. This search was undoubtedly for means of communication. Several raids by the R.A.F. had now occurred, and the more ignorant Iraqis were developing a groundless notion that we possessed means of signalling to aircraft or to Habbaniyah. The more sensible probably wanted to make quite sure that we had not; it may be that by the 8 th May they had word of the impending arrival on the 10 th May of the first German aircraft, and were particularly anxious that we should not be able to communicate news of this. The radio in the bath-room was discovered and impounded, together with the electrical set of my gramophone (which they affected to believe was a transmitter), and all binoculars. Even typewriters were demanded (why was never clear), but this was at the time successfully resisted. Towards the end of May, however, it was revived, and all typewriters were taken. From the 8 th May until the arrival of the I.P.C. Americans on the 28th May we had no news of the outside world beyond what we could see from our windows. 40. At 6 p.m. on the 9th May an officer arrived with orders that all were to be removed to an undisclosed destination outside the Mosul liwa. All were ordered to prepare one piece of luggage, to take not more than I.D. 5 per person and to be ready in two hours’ time. At 8 o’clock two army lorries appeared, and the first persons were already being put aboard when counter-orders arrived cancelling the proposed move. We never discovered what lay behind this order and counter-order. The inadequate road transport supplied suggests that we were intended to be taken in batches to the railway station and that the destination was probably Bagdad. Perhaps there was an idea that quarters would be wanted for the Germans and Italians. 41. When the projected move was announced, I requested communication with the Turkish Consul. My intention was to try and make some arrangement for the custody of the consulate. The Turkish Consul was informed of my wish to see him, but when he arrived at the consulate he was not allowed to approach. 42. On the 24th May I was requested by the officer of the guard to hand over my office keys. This I refused. p 43. The restrictions on our liberty increased as the month wore on. Efforts were mainly directed to preventing contact with the outside. The first phase 1 was the period from the 2nd-9th May, culminating in the false alarm of the move. The officers of the guard treated us reasonably, and messages were allowed to be sent out concerning commissions in town. The second phase was probably due to raids by the R.A.F., the arrival of the Axis missions and the reverses suffered by the Iraqis at Habbaniyah and elsewhere. The local news- sheets that we obtained and the astonishing war news confided to us by the Army Intelligence Officer, Yunis Rafiq, indicated the extent to which the population were being fed on lies about Iraqi military successes. The removal of our radio sets was due in part to a fear that a receiver might be, or be made to be a transmitter; but more, I think, to a fear that we should find means of spreading9 in the town the more correct news of the B.B.C. The military were not, in fact, at all sure of themselves. Brigadier Qasim Maqsud’s defeatism has been mentioned in paragraph 2. Enthusiasm for the “ war ' (at a distance)—as distinct from enthusiasm for an opportunity of helping themselves to British property from such treasure troves as Qaiyarah and lording it over the civil ^ population, which affected officers of all ranks from Qasim Maqsud downwards— was mainly confined to the younger officers of the effendi class. 44. From the 10 th May until just before the end we were subjected to increasing restriction. The gate was locked. v o visitors were allowed. The officers of the guard were of a much less pleasant type, and sometimes behaved very arbitrarily. The rations were minutely searched. Every joint of meat was slit open, and every loaf of bread; packets of cigarettes were opened, the labels of tinned goods were torn off. The guard seemed to have an obsession about paper that must have meant fear of messages. The climax was reached when an order of toilet paper was received, and the sheets were unpacked to the bitter end and festooned all over the garden before delivery. 45. The restrictions that caused most friction were connected with air raids. The first British aircraft appeared on the afternoon of the 4th May at 3 p.m. and dropped bombs on the Ghazlani camp area. It was met with a fusillade of indiscriminate rifle and machine-gun fire from every soldier, policeman or civilian with a weapon, whether in or out of range. As bullets flew right and left round the consulate, we decided that we must discipline our community to some form of A.R.P., lest somebody be caught at a window or on the roof by a stray bullet—perhaps by an ostensibly stray bullet. This idea was then taken up by our guards, not with a view to our safety, but to prevent us signalling to aircraft and seeing what damage was done. The consulate commands a good view of the railway station, barracks and aerodrome. The roofs and balconies were forbidden, everyone was made to assemble in the inner rooms of the ground floor, no one was supposed to be seen at windows, and the guard came in and patrolled the courtyard and roof during raids. The restrictions on the use of the roof and balconies were then extended to cover all times, raid or no raid. Attempts were made to confine us to the basement during raids, but these were successfully resisted. All this was submitted to for fear of an incident, or an “ accident,’' or an incitement of the mob. 46. It proved impossible to get the officers to stick to consistent rules; each had a new idea and each was given to changing his mind. The flicker of a kitchen oil-stove was seen from the outside at dusk during a raid; the officer was found assaulting the servants for alleged signalling. The most troublesome officer, Lieutenant Hasseeb-al-Sherbati, made a vague but vehement accusation that people had been seen peering from forbidden windows. This was, to the best of our knowledge, untrue and we declined to make enquiry unless some particulars were given. He refused to give particulars and in revenge confined everybody for one and a half hours in a very restricted space during the next raid, and kept the rations waiting for two or three hours in the sun, dust and flies. Since the armistice I have had an official enquiry from the mutessarif concerning this officer’s conduct and have stated my opinion. 47. The truth is that petty oppressions of this kind gave a spice to an otherwise boring and nerve-trying existence by giving us something to outwit. They also convinced us of the bad morale of the rebels, and the fear in which they stood of the R.A.F. They turned the authorities’ attention from more serious inflictions; and of course they failed in their object. We saw all we wanted to. The air-raid siren was badly managed, and' when British aircraft made surprise attacks on the aerodrome the really important events had taken place, and been seen, in an incredibly short space of time, before the siren went and we were herded to our confinement to gloat over our observations. Our fear that the Germans would take a hand in our custody was not realised; they were otherwise engaged. 48. It is unnecessary to describe more than certain of the air activity. The first German aircraft arrived at 7.30 a.m. on the 10 th May. Two Ju. 90 four- engined troop-carriers flew in from the west and circled over the town. They were the only Axis aircraft seen to arrive with their original markings. Subsequent arrivals were painted over with Iraqi markings, though in some cases the Italian white cross was left on the tail with Iraqi markings on the wings. The Germans were met with the same fusillade as had greeted our [25—28] r10 machines, and the first landed while firing was in progress. But recognition and the protests of the occupants caused the “ceasefire” whistle to be blown everywhere, and by the time the second machine came in all was quiet. After this there was no more indiscriminate firing from the town for the rest of the rebellion. The troop-carriers had been put under cover before two R.A.F. bombers appeared three-quarters of an hour later to bomb the Ghazlani barracks but not, ^ unfortunately, the hangars of the aerodrome. 49. On the 11 th two Heinkel Ill’s appeared, and from this time on there was a constant trickle of incoming and outgoing enemy aircraft, mainly Heinkel 111 , Messerschmitt 110, and (on the 28th May) about twelve CR 42’s. Machines took off more or less regularly at dawn, presumably to patrol and to raid Habbaniyah. Slipways were made on the east side of the airfield, and machines were put under cover of the trees between the airfield and the river. It was impossible to tell in the various comings and goings how many Axis aircraft were brought to Mosul; fifteen at a time was the maximum we counted. About fifty Germans and about twelve Italians seem to have been quartered in Mosul. The townspeople were impressed by (a) the segregation of Germans from Italians— the Germans mixed more in the town, and frequented the shops and coffee-houses; (b) the wolf-like appetites of the Germans for such common local necessities as bread and raisins. Dr. Grobba and his mission are believed to have passed through Mosul on their outward journey; they certainly spent from the 29th-31st May here on their homeward retirement. From statements made to the French Consul by Dr. Hans Ulrich von Granow (? Gronau), the German Counsellor, when he applied for Syrian visas, they were trying to organise continued resistance based on Mosul, and were highly disgusted with the Iraqis for preparing to capitulate without consulting them. They left by road for Tel Kotchek on the afternoon of the 31st May, and the scramble of their departure was duly noted by the public. Thirty-four Italians left by Tel Kotchek that day. 50. The Iraqi Air Force took the air very little. A number of the Hawker- Audax machines in the station were not airworthy, and a Northrop which came in from the Bagdad direction shortly after the arrival of the Germans on the 10 th May was almost immediately machine-gunned and grounded by the R.A.F. Most of the Hawker machines spent the month dispersed on the ground round the airfield, and most were found to have bullet and splinter holes when subsequently inspected. One Iraqi iVudax was destroyed on the aerodrome by the R.A.F. 51. Altogether the Axis lost eight machines in Mosul. Two (Messerschmitts) were bombed and put out of action on the west side of the field on the 16th May; one (Heinkel) was blown to pieces by a lucky bomb dropped by a Valentia in the trees near the river on the night of the 14th May; and two (one Heinkel and one f ? Italian]) were machine-gunned and set on fire on the east side of the field on the 22nd May by two Hurricanes, one of which was hit during the raid and crashed in the Shorah Nahiyah. Of the remainder, a Messerschmitt 110 was put out of action by a bad landing, and this machine, together with another Messerschmitt 110 evidently unserviceable, was burnt on the airfield by the departing Germans on the morning of the 31st May. The eighth machine, a Heinkel 111 , was abandoned in an unserviceable condition in the hangars. Apart from this highly successful work, and the destruction of a refuelling lorry, not much damage was done by air raids in Mosul. A good many bombs were wasted on the partly abandoned Ghazlani camp. 52. On the 14th May at about 7.30 p.m. three Blenheim aircraft, flying quite low in formation, dropped three bombs intended for the railway. The first two fell in the station yard, though not on the tracks, did slight damage and caused one or two casualties; the third was very wide of the mark, and fell at the Bab-el-Sinjar crossroads at the western end of Nineveh .Street just outside a coffee-shop where a number of people were assembled. Thirty-two persons were killed, and about the same number injured. The town siren failed to give any alarm until after the bombs had dropped. This incident caused a number of inhabitants to vacate houses in the south-west side of the town. 53. The station was at the time a very justifiable target. On the 13th May two trains of French war material arrived from Syria, carrying one battery of 75-mm. field guns, 10,000 rifles, 250 automatic arms, and 460 tons of munitions and lorries, loaded at Rayak and Baalbek. This material was feverishly dispersed in various parts of the town and in quarries round! it. Another munition trainr 11 arrived from Syria on the 24th or 25th May. On the morning of the latter day we saw’ two of a battery of four 155-mm. howitzers of old pattern being drawn from the station. The material was supervised at Tel Kotchek by M. Renouhardt, a German member of the Armistice Commission, and the emissary who came to Iraq to negotiate for the deliveries was a Levantine mongrel called Milaucene (alias Mulhausen, no doubt). Two French officers, Donne and Robert, came to negotiate for wheat and petrol to be supplied to Syria. 54. Two British aircraft were lost in the district. One, a Blenheim, was hit by rifle or machine-gun fire while attacking Mosul aerodrome on the 10th May, and is reported to have come down in the Makhmur qadha of the Arbil liwa south of Guweir. The Mudir Nahiyah of Shorah, Tewfiq Shabib (see paragraph 21 ), exceeded his duties by taking charge at Guweir (outside his district) of the two occupants who were taken prisoner, and brought them into Mosul. The third occupant was killed. His body was brought to the Dominican Fathers, and their building was at once surrounded by an angry crowd, out to mutilate the body, and police protection had to be given. The Fathers buried him in the crypt of their church. The other, a Hurricane, was likewise hit over Mosul aerodrome and came down near Shorah on the 22 nd May (see paragraph 51), the pilot being killed. He was buried' in the British Cemetery at Bab el Sinjar by the Iraqis. On the 13th May a British aircraft was intercepted and chased by a German machine within sight of the town. It dived low across the Tigris, and appeared from the town to be coming down on the far bank, but escaped. The hooligan element of the town immediately set out across the bridge, armed with sticks and knives. Read in conjunction with the incident at the Dominican church, this shows the temper of the Mosul mob. 55. About the 29th May we noticed a change in the demeanour of om* Iraqi warders. Restrictions were still maintained, but rumours of the flight of the Rashidists and the advance of the British forces began to filter in, and the troops treated us with more consideration. A southbound train which left on the evening of the 28th returned at 5-45 a.m. on the 29th with its engine in reverse, clearly indicating that an interruption in the railway had occurred between here and Bagdad. On the morning of the 31st many Axis aircraft took off and did not return, and we saw the burning of unserviceable machines on the aerodrome. At 6-45 p.m. on the 1 st June the Commandant of Police (Kamil Yahya) arrived and informed us that an armistice had been signed, that we were free, but that, since there were insufficient police and troops in the town to ensure our safety (there had been many desertions to Syria), he begged that we would all remain in the * consulate or its immediate vicinity. I accordingly caused everyone to remain quartered in the consulate, and only to go out after reference to me and the provision of an escort. The military guard had been withdrawn and a small protective guard of police had been placed at the gate. On the morning of tlm 3rd June British aircraft arrived, bringing a battalion of Gurkhas to occupy th; aerodrome, and the majority of the British and American community were ferried to Habbaniyah by the returning aircraft. Throughout the first half of June such Englishmen as remained lived in or near the consulate, and went about their business by arrangement, keeping to the main streets. A skeleton B.O.D. staff visited Qaiyarah and Ain Zalah to take over and report, but not to reside there. Sullen and angry looks could be seen in the town, and it was evident that strong doses of Axis propaganda and a feeling of having been baulked of an opportunity to triumph and run wild, were having effect. The final efforts of the Germans had been to sow the beliefs that they were soon to return in irresistible force, and that the British were out to wreak sanguinary vengeance on all who got in their way. 1)6. Seeing that the Mosul rabble bears an evil reputation in a country where no such element bears a good one, and that disorders occurred in Bagdad and Basra, credit must be given to the authorities here for having allowed none to happen in Mosul either during or following the rebellion. On the 31st May Brigadier Qasim Maqsud fled to Kirkuk, where he was apprehended. He conformed to Rashid Ali’s orders, and for the rest seems to have concentrated on appropriating a considerable sum of money and some British property, and preventing disorder. Although a great deal of British property was stolen, and in particular the B.O.D. camp at Qaiyarah was systematically stripped by the military, there was no riotous looting. Claims to the value of just under I.D.33,500 have been received at this consulate, about I.D. 10,660 from individuals, [25—28] Dthe remainder from the B.O.D. Company. The articles confiscated at the consulate were for the most part returned in June (some from Qasim Maqsud’s own baggage). Some credit for the maintenance of order in the critical days after Qasim Maqsud’s departure and before the return of the rightful mutessarif, Tahsin Ali, must be given to the Commandant of Police, Kamil Yahya (who, all the same, is reputed to have profited by the thefts in May), and to a handful of ^ the better citizens of Mosul, chief of whom were Salim Namiq (Qaimmaqam of Mosul) and Khair-ud-din A1 Umari (President of the Municipality). Aftermath. 57. It was not to be expected that the glow of this conflagration would be soon extinguished. Propaganda had been too long at work, money had been handed out and the Germans had made use of their time here to plant agents. Propaganda was actively carried on from Syria both during and after the rebel lion. On the 19th May the Special Service Officer at Kamishlieh reported to his superior at Hassetcheh that Sheikh Daham al Hadi, chief of the Syrian Shammar, was touring his tribe to instruct them to leave for Iraq on the 22nd May. What prevented them is not known, unless it was that they sensed the coming collapse. On the night of the 31st May Dr. Grobba stopped for two hours at Tel Kotchek to interview Sheikh Wadban. As late as the 29th June M. Renouhardt and Major Meyer-Ricks, of the Armistice Commission, inter viewed Sheikh Daham at Hassetcheh and offered him money and arms to intimidate Sheikh Sofouq with tales of German successes and of the Germans’ imminent return to Iraq via Russia and Persia, and to harass the British on the Iraq frontier. A description of this interview and of the French S.S.O.’s attitude towards it is given as an annex to this report.Q 58. The expulsion of the Italian Legation, British penetration into Syria and Persia, the shifting of the war from the Near East to Russia, the removal from Mosul of a number of anti-British individuals, the arrival of increasingly large British forces, and the healing of time have progressively driven this sullen hostility underground. With the usual reservations always applicable to such a backward area, the town and countryside are now normal for anyone to go about, and you will not see the black looks of last June. As late as August there were instances of stones being thrown at British military transport by children undoubtedly encouraged by their parents and elders; that is no longer (November) the case. Nevertheless, it would be unwise to say that the sentiments of this mercurial population are fundamentally satisfactory. Nationalism, which has for long been staple food in the schools, the army and the coffee-shops, does not need the stimulant of Nazi propaganda to dispose people of limited vision to be no more than outwardly friendly towards a Power that is in important respects in occupation. Any important German success in Asia could very quickly alter things. And there are still Nazi sympathisers here. 59. It was a very long time before anything was done to remove the C.I.D. police inspector, Amin Zaki. whose occult influence opposed a proper clean-up of undesirables. He was defended by the mutessarif, Tahsin Ali, and only after the latter’s departure was transferred to Zibar, where it is hoped that he can do no harm. The Director of Education, who in no circumstances ought to be a man of totalitarian leanings, is still Yusif Zainal; and, if Tahsin Ali did not remove him as mutessarif, it is to be feared that he will not do so as Minister of Education, unless pressure is applied. The aggressive local secretary of the Youno- Men’s Moslem Association, Bashir Sakkal, still teaches in the Faisaliah School, although the association’s premises have been closed. The Faisaliah School, managed by the Awqaf, is an undesirable institution as at present constituted. 60. The Iraq army is a difficult problem. The military experience ^ained by many of the officers in May consisted of swaggering about and having their own way for a month, moving from barracks into town in case they were bombed driving about in cars of British subjects and living in the loot of Qaiyarah. The collapse of what was essentially an army rebellion has left a sense of frustration which seeks an outlet. The Yezidi situation in September seemed to offer an opportunity, more especially as that situation is closely bound up with the (9 Not printed.13 intrigues of the Shammar sheikhs, who had undue influence with 1 ahsin Ah. Had it not been for timely action prompted from British agencies, there would in all likelihood have been another punitive expedition of the deplorable type that has occurred in the past when the Iraq army has acted against minorities. The Iraqi District Commander at Mosul, Brigadier Abdur Razzaq Hussein, is a pleasant and well-meaning officer, and not the only one; but the wrong spirit has for so long resided in army circles that it must be a work of time before it can be exorcised. 61. The police have suffered from a precipitate change of commandants. One of Tahsin All’s first acts on his return to Mosul was to dismiss Kamil \ ahya. who, being a Moslawi, remained resident in the town. Opinions are divided as to whether Kamil Yahya was a good or a bad commandant, but it is likely that the presence on the spot of a dismissed commandant, in a country where the out-of-office of to-day is so often the in-office of to-morrow, has had a cramping effect on the work of the police and his successor. His dismissal had the effect of shutting his mouth concerning the whereabouts of a great deal of the loot taken in May, about which he probably knows a good deal. The Britisih forces have had much trouble to get proper police co-operation in checking considerable thefts of material that occurred when they first arrived. 62. The mutessarif, Tahsin Ali, suffered from having been here too often, as mutessarif or as police commandant, and having too many old friends at a time when a good deal of impartial firmness was needed. It is not doubted that his sentiments are friendly and he possesses a bluff exterior that is one of a mutessarif’s assets; but beneath that exterior he is too pliant, and his attitude during the threatened Yezidi trouble showed that he is not a level-headed administrator. His elevation to Cabinet rank in October leaves the way open for a successor who will have a considerable task. 63. The countryside has got into possession of more and better arms. Deserting soldiers at' the end of May are reported to have returned to villages with army rifles and ammunition. It would be interesting to know where some of the French arms brought in in May have gone. About 300 Lebel rifles were issued in the early autumn by the acting mutessarif to certain villages, for the classic reason of dealing with the wild pig, who admittedly do cause much destruction; but there are arguments against the wisdom of this. The customary apprehensions have been current among the Christian and Yezidi population, who are apt to exaggerate their fears, but no serious incident has occurred. The presence of British forces in the liwa has assisted towards this. 64. The British forces have brought some welcome money into the area. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to prevent too much of this going into the pockets of property owners, sheikhs and contractors, and too little into those of the poorer classes who are faced with the inevitable rise in the cost of living. It is to be hoped that measures to import stocks of essential commodities, and to control their distribution and sale, will be effective; otherwise there will be distress, and our ill-wishers will father yet another grievance on to us. 65. Such is the debit side of the account. On the credit side there is no doubt that the fomentation and discharge of the sore that has been infecting this district for several years has cleared the way for better relations. Things are better than they were nine months ago. and this not only because we have scored a success in Iraq and introduced our armed forces. We should not, however, lose sight of the fact that those in Mosul and Northern Iraq who are not time-serving, mercenary and parochial in outlook are greatly outnumbered by those who are, and that the only thing that really succeeds here is success.

A MONTH has elapsed since I wrote my last despa tch (No 317 of thp 11 th November) describing current events in this country, and I am glad to be able to inform you that the improvement in the internal situation, which I was then able to describe, has been maintained. 2 . Nuri Said’s Government has continued to suppress activities prejudicial to the Anglo-Iraqi Alliance and the effect of their action has, on the whole, been satisfactory. Thirty to forty more troublesome men have been interned in Fao, where there are now some 170 inmates. The murderer of Captain Jeffreys in INasiriyah in early June has been convicted and sentenced to death, the mutessarif and commandant of police in charge at the time have both been dismissed, and ten people from the town have been sent to Fao. The trial by court-martial of Saiyid Alwan-al-Yasiri, for presiding over the illegal meeting of Parliament which set aside the Regent last April, began on the 25th November; and Muhammad Hassan Haidar, who summoned Deputies to the meeting in his capacity as deputy chairman, was also arrested for trial after the Chamber had agreed to suspend his parliamentary immunity. The trials of Rashid Ali, his Cabinet colleagues and the five generals who took part in his insurrection are’also proceeding before the Military Court at A1 Rashid. No sentences have yet been passed. e, 0 3. On the 6 th November twenty officers of the Iraqi army were arrested, including four who had played a prominent part in Kirkuk during Rashid Ali’s rebellion, and an officer who had formerly been Director of Propaganda in the time of Taha al Hashimi’s Cabinet was placed on pension. I understand that the Piime Minister has so far arrested or dismissed about eighty officers. 4. The Prime Minister has initiated his plan of reducing the establishment of the army by making the third battalion of each brigade into a cadre only; he has also made a beginning in certain areas with the abolition of conscription. The Speech from the Throne contained no mention of any specific plan, but, on the contrary, referred to the steps to be taken to strengthen the army. The Prime Minister’s intention is therefore seen to be the creation of a smaller but more efficient army. 5. The murder of Fakhri Nashashibi outside his hotel in Bagdad on the 9th November showed that further action against Palestinian political fugitives in Iraq was necessary. Two Palestinians with bad records (one a relative of the Mufti) weie aiiested and are awaiting trial, and a number of other Palestinians were rounded up and packed off to their own country. 6 . The Education Department in the Mosul 1 Liwa still contains many undesirable teachers and the Liwa Education Director is a man with a long record of anti-British conduct. I hope soon to persuade the Prime Minister to° remove him and dismiss a number of subordinates. 7. More authority has been given to the remaining British officers in the police headquarters in Bagdad. Major Cones, the chief inspecting officer, will now be given a considerable say in appointments and promotions in addition to other new powers, and Major Wilkins has been put in executive control of the C.I.D. and Passport and Residence Sections of the Police. 8 . Parliament was adjourned on the 30th November after having sat for one month. The reason for the adjournment was that the Government have not yet completed the budget (for 1942-43), which is always the principal business of the annual session. So far, the session has not been eventful, but there were points in the proceedings which are worth noting. The Chamber’s reply to th^- '' Speech from the Throne expressed gratitude to the Regent for the restoraJJeif^O^* ” , [25—34] tjf At*/Qec fUo2 the constitutional life of the country and appreciation of the personal sacrifices made by His Highness in saving the country from the hazardous situation into which it had been brought by wicked men and foreign intrigues. The reply also urged that Iraq’s pledges to her Allies should be fulfilled in the letter and the spirit. This is the first occasion on which a resolution has been passed by the Chamber upholding the Anglo-Iraqi Alliance in such a manner. 9. Three laws were passed dealing with the steady and continuous rise in the cost of living. The first provided special high cost-of-living allowances free of income tax to all State employees with salaries under I.D. 21 a month; the second authorised similar allowances to State pensioners; and the third gave the Government powers to take steps to deal with attempts to corner essential commodities. Another important economic measure was the Exchange Control Law which came into force on the 24th November. This prohibits all dealings in foreign exchange except through banks licensed by the Minister of Finance. It does not apply to dealings in currencies within the “ sterling area.” With the enactment of this law Iraq secured readmission into the “ sterling area.” 10 . The Chamber showed its independence by rejecting four ordinances enacted by Jamil Madfai’s Government and by refusing to accept the Senate’s adverse vote on a draft law amending the Expropriation Law of 1934. In each instance action was taken on the recommendation of the Chamber’s own committees and without a lead from the Government. 11 . The Prime Minister made a speech of some interest in the Senate on the 16th November, in which he defended the existing democratic institutions in Iraq and declared his wish to strengthen the authority of the Iraqi Parliament. He foreshadowed amendments to the Electoral Law designed to bring about a better representation of all classes of the people. Nuri Said put forward a similar project to Parliament in 1939 without result, and it does not appear likely that the Government will introduce legislation of this kind during the current session. 12 . The cost of living continues to rise in spite of all that the Government has been able to do to check it. Supplies of essential goods are not lacking, but speculation is rife and wholesale and retail prices are adjusted to war news rather than to any calculation of supply and demand. The outbreak of war with Japan sent the prices of piece-goods and food-stufis up with a bound and wheat touched the record figure of I.U. 24 a ton, which is about four times the average for pre-war prices. The poor are being hard hit and exceptionally cold weather is adding to their suffering. In the circumstances, discontent is inevitable and our detractors hasten to put all the blame on the British Government. The employment by the British forces of a very large number of labourers and craftsmen is a considerable palliative to the present economic distress of the poorer classes, but I fear that, unless the Government succeed in forcing down the prices of food and clothing, discontent may create a serious situation. 13. The Regent paid an official visit to Basra between the 3rd December and 6 th December. His Highness took with him the young King Feisal and the Amir Zaid. The little King is truly popular everywhere, and the party received a cordial welcome wherever they went. 14. A new mutessarif, Hissam al Din Juma, has been sent to Mosul. In spite of some dubious points in his record, he has good qualities, and in the present circumstances was probably the best available man to send there. There has been no further trouble with the Yezidis and the Shammar have remained quiet. 15. With encouragement from the Egyptian Charge d’Affaires, the Ministry of Education have arranged for a series of cultural lectures to be given by Egyptian professors now in Government service in Iraq. The opening lecture was attended by the Regent and speeches welcoming the occasion as a further step towards closer cultural collaboration between Egypt and Iraq were delivered by the Iraqi Minister of Education and the Egyptian Charge d’Affaires. The press were unanimous in their applause, and the Prime Minister in a subse quent interview expressed his gratitude for Egypt’s help to the Arab cause. He pointed out that history showed that cultural collaboration had always been the prelude to the establishment of political collaboration between all nations which had achieved national unity. The next event in what the press are calling the season of Iraqi-Egyptian cultural collaboration will be the annual meeting of the Arab Medical Congress, which will be held in Cairo at the end of December.3 16. The situation in the Kurdish districts in Iraq remains normal. Early in December a young Avromani from Persia visited the embassy with a letter signed by a number of Avromani chieftains authorising him to consult the ambassador about their situation. He was asked to tell the chieftains that in .their own interests they should seek an understanding on reasonable terms with ^Pthe Persian Government. He was frankly warned that the Persian Kurds should expect no support from the British for their revolt, but at the same time he was assured that His Majesty’s Government took a friendly interest in the Kurds and would try to help them if they behaved sensibly. 17. The Iraqi Government formally broke off diplomatic relations with France and Japan in the middle of November. The French and Japanese Legation staffs have not yet left the country. 18. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majestys representatives at Angora, Cairo, Tehran and Jedda; the Minister of State, Cairo; His Majesty’s High Commissioner for Palestine and Transjordan; the Governor-General of India; the Commander-in-chief, India; General Headquarters, Middle East; the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf ; the Political Agent, Koweit, and to His Majesty’s Consuls at Basra and Mosul.

ENCLOSE IN WEEKLY LETTER No * 5 3 1 JAM 942 FROM SECRETARY, EXTERNAL DEPT., INDIA OFFICECypher telegram from Secretary of State to Government of India, External Affairs Department, Mo. 1841, dated 1st February, 1942. Following is from Foreign Office to Bagdad No.123 dated 30th January. Repeated to Cairo No.522. Jedda No.32, Jerusalem No.120. Begins. Your telegram No.96 (of January 28th. Suggestion ^.that Iraq and Saudi Arabia should enter the war) . I note that proposed declaration of war by Iraq would in your view and in that of General Officer Commanding facilitate your tasks. I accept your recommendation that we ought not to discourage Irani Prime Minister’s proposals. You may certainly show appreciation of his spontaneous offer and let him know that we are in favour of declaration of war by Iraq. 2. As regards timing and procedure, I still feel that approach to Ibn Baud had better be made in the first place by us, rather than by General Nuri. His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda has already been invited by Ibn Saud to visit him at Riyadh within the next two or three weeks. I think it very desirable that the matter should be broached by Mr. Bird with Ibn Saud personally during this visit, and I shall be grateful if General Nuri will agree to refrain from approachin Ibn Saud himself, (and not to commit himself about sending an emissary to Ibn Gaud), until Mr.Bird has reported Ibn Gaud’s reactions. Instructions to Mr.Bird will be rent as soon as possible. 3. I presume that, when once Iraq has declared war, we are likely to be faced with requests for assistance of 'various kinds, but particularly for war material. It may be difficult,if not impossible, to meet such requests, and their rejection, no ever inevitable this may be, will probably lead to much disappointment. May it not therefore be well to warn General Nuri in advance how difficult it may still be for us to help even after Iraq has declared war? Ends.

The General Officer Commanding and I agree that declaration of state of war by Iraq would facilitate our task in this country. We think that by definitely committing Iraqis it would make them face up to their responsibilities and give them a greater feeling of solidarity 0 Defence of their country would become a clearly defined aim and defence measures would be more comprehensive. 3. On the other hand, discouragement of Prime Minister’s proposals would seriously embarrass me. I must emphasise that it was entirely spontaneous and unprompted by me and that it is the first iirab offer of [?grp. omit. ?this] sort which we have had in this war. Prime Minister tells me it has the support of all the chief politicians including his opponents. It seems to me that we should shew appreciation and not give him the unjustifiable impression that he has done something of v/hich we do not approve. I am under no illusions regarding unreliability of Iraqis but I am none the less convinced that our policy must be [grp. undec. ?elasticl and encouraging if we are to get any good out of them. Nil my energies have been devoted to that end since June and it would be a bad set-back if we were to reject this spontaneous offer. V/e could only expect a relapse into apathy and discouragement and that would undoubtedly affect our military and political position. The rehabilitation of Iraq in the eyes of the world is, I agree, of very secondary importance. E. While I agree that a.declaration of war by Ibn Saud would ^ have a far greater effect in the Moslem world than a similar declaration by Iraq, I cannot believe the effect of the latter would be negligible. To my mind a simultaneous declaration would be best from all points of view.

LOST INNEDIATE . Your telegrams Nos^ 22 and 55 /of 8th and 15th January/ and Cairo telegram No.308 /of 23rd January: suggestions that Iraq and Saudi Arabia should enter the v/ar/. It seems to us that declaration of war by Ibn Saud would have important political effect throughout Arab world, whereas declaration of war by Iraq would only have an effect in Iraq itself. I should therefore like an expression of your opinion as to the probable effect of such a declaration by Iraq on the Iraqi situation. Would it, for instance, facilitate your task and that of the military authoities ? I would prefer, in any case, not to commit ourselves finally with regard to General Nuri's suggestion until we have had time to examine more fully its probable implications, for example in Egypt. 2. It follows also that we shall have to be particularly careful as regards the most important problem, viz the manner in which an approach is made to Ibn Saud. It is difficult to forecast what Ibn 3aud*s reactions are likely to be to an approach from General hurt, but they might well be unfavourable. It would probably be better that, we should approacn Ibn Saud ourselves, and on our own initiative,/iff initiative, rather than that General-Nuri should approach him or that we should merely convey a message from General Nuri. 3. If Ion Saud should react unfavourably to the suggestion of a declaration of war, or should put forward unacceptable conditions, we could always fall back on course 'C' in my telegram No.5 to Jedda /of 4th January/. 4. As regards the further suggestion that the two countries should accede to the Twentysix Power Pact, I cannot interpret a multilaters^C pact of this kind without consulting the other signatories and canno^ therefore .give a definite answer to General huri's enquiry whether under the Pact Iraq would oe expected to do more than is laid down in .rt-i-cle 4 of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty. The Pact lays down that the signatories snail employ their full resources, military or economic, against those members of the Tripartite Pact with whom they are at -war. Iraq cannot accede conditionally. ' At the same time it is obvious that many of the signatories will not do more than Iraq is bound to do under the Treaty of Alliance, and it is clearly the intention of all concerned that the obligations of the various signatories shall be interpreted reasonably. 5. My conclusion, which is sufficiently, in agreement with Paragraph 7 of C e iro telegram No.308, is that v/e must handle Ibn Saud first and independently. This does not preclude a simultaneous declaration by Saudi i-m-abia and Iraq if such a step on the part of the latter can be^ justified on its merits and not in relation to it-s eiieccs on the Arab world which will, iu my opinion, be sms.ll, or ^o the neeci icr rehabilitating Iraq whicn is a secondary eonsideratron. In the meanti— Nuri must be held off and position of Egypt in itself seems to give good ground for our doin 0 so. In an v . case you mast make it plain to Nuri that on this question v/e must begin with Ibn Saud: and while I cannot prevent Nuri from communicating with latter I should prefer him not to do so and must in any event ask him not to imply that he does so after consultation with us. *(This telegram is of particular secrecy and should he retained hy the authorised recipient and not passed on).

Nuri Pasha wished for some re-assurances that adherence to the Pact would not involve Iraq in obligations greater than those laid down in article 4 of the Treaty of Alliance of June 30th 1930.

Middle East Jar Council. 2. As regards Saudi Arabia, I agree with His Majesty’s Minister at jedda, that alternative (a) in paragraph 3 of your telegram No. 5 to him (Treaty of Alliance) has little to recommend it and m any case would take too long. As between alternatives (b) and (c) I favour clear cut declaration of war. Major advantage whicn we seek is publicity value in the Moslem world ot Ibn Saud’s open association with us; and from this point of view tne declaration of war wnich would be easily understood and free from any ambiguity would surely have/» have much c reater effect than the declaration suggested in alternative (c). Moreover, it has a quality of directness likely to appeal to Ibn Saud. I do not favour trie suggestion that Ibn Saud (?should) make a declaration of sympathy now and eventually declare war at some later date. His honour would (? I think) prevent him declaring war when it was too obvious tnat we were going to be victorious. 3. I do not consider that alternative (b) need involve more ^ active participation by Ibn Saud in tne war tuan would alternative (c). He realises the complete dej;endence of the Arabs on us and has no illusions about playing an active military part. So far as can be foreseen, tnerefore, he would not expect large supplies of war material from us in return for declaration of war as feared bj Mr. Stonenewer Bird. . : . • .-. . . 4. Matters on which Ibn Saud probably would ask assistance would be: t . (a) motor transport (for which he has already asked); (b) financial aid and concessions. I presume this need not be serious obstacle; (c) for tne rest he might hope for a protective treaty after tne war to improve tne chances of survival of his dynasty. 5. As regards Holy Cities I see no possible advantage to the Axis in bombing Mecca or Medina. 6. I agree tnat in any case we snould so far as possible specify at the outset what facilities we want in Saudi Arabia. 7. Considering our relations with .Ibn Saud, I think we should give him an opportunity of declaring war first or at any rate simultaneously. When approaching him I snould see no objection to our also informing him frankly of Muri's proposal. A premature declaration of war b, Iraq might make Ibn Saud reluctant to take ary action and in any case would seriously diminish the value of subsequent declaration of war by him. 8. I am going to Baghdad on January ^4th and will telegraph further on the merits and timing of Iraqi declaration of war after discussion with Sir K.Cornwallis. Meanwhile I urge decision on Saudi Arabia be reached as soon as possible so that we can go anead there in any case. Please communicate decision to me at Baghdad where i snail be until January 27th.

Unfortunately the Prime Minister’s energy soon began to flag, and the he readiness which he showed to yield to the importunities of those who besought him to spare even some of the most active of pro-Nazi enthusiasts eventually brought about his fall. ft/U *4^ ^ C 4. In July, however, the Government was still fairly active. Propaganda » r was accumulating rather than losing energy, and though much of it was devoted ( 0 *u.fL Kl*. Dkt'olu . 1 ao, °t. 1 to praise of Jamil Madfai as the true patriot rather than to condemnation of tn J 5 Rashid Ali and the principles for which he stood, there was still promise of 1 further action to eradicate pro-nazism from the public services. 5. On the 13th July three obscure men were publicly hanged for crimes committed during the rioting of the 1 st and 2 nd June, and about the same time a number of others were sentenced to terms of imprisonment. The effect was salutary, but these punishments cannot be regarded as a just and adequate liquidation of the deplorable happenings of those two days. Many police and military officers are known to have taken part in the general looting and killing, but few of them were punished, and even where disciplinary action was taken it seldom fitted the crime. The report of the commission set up to enquire into the events of those two days was in the hands of the Madfai Government some time before their resignation, but they took no action against the high officials whose conduct is impugned. 6 . During the latter half of July and the early davs of August further action was taken against many of the Palestinian and Syrian political fugitives who had for so long infected political life in Iraq with their extreme nationalism and bitter hatred of Great Britain. A large number were repatriated and about thirty were banished to villages in the Kurdish districts, where they are unlikely to find public sympathy for their troublesome agitation. These prophylactic measures were rounded off by the successful arrest of three turbulent tribesmen of the south . Sheikh Abdul Wahid-al-Haj Sikkar, Saiyid Alwan-al-Yasiri and Saiyid Qati-al-Awadi. All three had been most active supporters of Rashid Ali and had continued to exercise a baneful influence even after his flight The removal of these men brought much relief to the Southern Euphrates area, where endemic disputes among well-armed tribes gave them wide opportunities for dangerous intrigues. 7. In the army a mild purge was carried out, and about eighty officers of all ranks were retired on pensions. 8 . By the middle of August, however, the Government’s efforts to mop up the big pockets of anti-British elements left behind after the rout of Rashid Ali’s main forces began to slacken. The completion of the internment camp at Fao hung fire, and action taken by mutasarnfs against pro-Nazi officials was often reversed by Ministers. The impression thus spread abroad that the Prime Minister favoured appeasement and agitation against ourselves be&lt;mn to revive [24—35] RECd. POL* DEFt» i 2 9. At this stage the British march into Persia to some extent diverted public attention from home affairs, and the success with which it was carried out stimulated confidence in Great Britain's position in the war. 10 . The Iraqi Government themselves, when informed of our intention to go into Persia to turn out the Germans, promised their support and assistance. They were at first a little anxious about possible political and military reactions on Iraq, but so soon as it was evident that there would be no serious opposition to our columns these anxieties faded away and I heard no more of them. In the I Holy Cities, where Persian religious influence is strong, the British entry into Persia and the subsequent abdication of the Shah were both welcomed. The Shah’s suppression of the age-old pilgrimage to Najaf and Kerbela and his treatment of the ulema in his own country had made him most unpopular with the Shiah priesthood and they rejoiced in his downfall. 11 . On the 1 st September official notices were published in the press summoning Rashid AH and all members of his Cabinet, the late Chief of the General Staff and the four Divisional Commanders known as the Golden Square, the former Director of Propaganda and the former Master of Ceremonies in the Palace to surrender themselves for trial. All were charged with offences against the State punishable by death, except Abdul Qadir Gailani, the former Master of Ceremonies, who was merely charged with defamation. Rashid Ali and two of his Ministers were already safely in Turkey and one of the generals vanished, but the remainder were all rounded up by our troops in Persia. 12 . Their fate remained under consideration for some time and was not decided until after Jamil Madfai had resigned and had been replaced by Nuri Said. With him it was agreed that all the accused men (together with some other less important political fugitives from this country who had also fallen into our hands) should be interned by His Majesty’s Government, that they should be tried in absentia in Bagdad, and that after sentence had been passed the Iraqi Govern ment should consider whether or not to ask for some or all of them to be handed over to suffer the punishment prescribed. Arrangements are now being made to remove them to Southern Rhodesia for internment as soon as transport can be | made available. 13. Some fugitive Palestinians from Iraq were also captured in Persia. Most of these are being sent back to Palestine, but about half-a-dozen with bad records are to go to Southern Rhodesia. The Mufti is still at large. 14. Soon after the beginning of September the Government’s hesitation in dealing with the still persistent pro-Nazi agitators provoked serious differences among members of the Cabinet, and the Minister of Finance, Ibrahim Kemal, resigned. His action was supported by one or two of his colleagues and by many influential people outside the Cabinet who shared his dissatisfaction with the liberty allowed to the large number of Rashid Ali’s supporters still left at large and with the absence of any scheme for the reorganisation of the army or the Ministry of Education. Jamil Madfai had in fact shown himself to be too small a man to deal with the exceptional difficulties with which he was faced. It is, however, to his credit that he took office at a time when no other Iraqi appeared willing to shoulder the responsibility, and that throughout the period of his premiership he worked in a spirit of friendship and co-operation with us. I believe that he is sincerely convinced that the future of his country must be closely linked with that of Great Britain, and, although in one or two matters he could not free himself from long-standing prejudices, he was genuinely ‘anxious to fulfil the many requirements of the military and Royal Air Force authorities. Considering how deeply Axis influence had penetrated into the life of Iraq, the co-operation and absence of friction during the past five months have, I think, been remarkable. 15. Jamil Madfai tried without success to find men to bring new strength to the Cabinet, and obviously saw in the circumstances that he would not be aT)le to remain in office much longer. At the Regent’s request, however, he agreed to carry on for another month to give His Royal Highness time to fin’d a successor. 16. The Regent did not make much use of this respite, and when I returned to Bagdad on the 16th September, after a short visit to Palestine, I found that His Highness and the principal politicians, though quite willing to air their views on what ought to be done, were waiting expectantly for me to make all the necessary moves to solve the crisis.* 8 ! 3 17. At my suggestion the Regent got into touch with those who might be able to form a Government, but he found that the likely men were all faced with difficulties which prevented them from undertaking this task. Ibrahim Kemal was from the point of view of efficiency the best candidate, but he has never taken any steps to court the confidence of the public, and he felt that he could not undertake office without the co-operation of Nuri Said. There has been a feud between the two for the last five years, during which they have not spoken to one another, and it was therefore not surprising that Nuri Said should refuse an invitation to serve as Minister of Defence. Ibrahim Kemal accordingly dropped out of the running and there remained only a choice between Nuri Said and a suppliant appeal to Jamil Madfai to remain in office. The Regent was rightly disinclined to take the second of these two alternatives, and so Nuri Said was brought hurriedly from Cairo (where he was the Iraqi Minister) to take part in i the political manoeuvres. 18. He arrived on the 5th October and four days later the following Cabinet was appointed :— Prime Minister and Acting Minister of Defence : Nuri Said. Minister of Interior and Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs : Salih Jabr. Minister of Finance : Ali Mumtaz. Minister of Economics : Abdul Mahdi. Minister of Justice : Sadiq Bassem. Minister of Education : Tahain Ali. Minister of Communications and Works : Amin Zaki. Minister of Social Affairs : Jamal Baban. 19. The Cabinet contains three Shiahs, one of whom is the Minister of the Interior. This is the first time that a Shiah has held this position. The Kurds have two representatives, and the Prime Minister, by taking for himself the portfolio of Defence, indicated his intention personally to accept responsibility } for bringing about the necessary reform of the army. 20. Both the Regent and Nuri Said consulted me closely throughout the negotiations which took place while the Cabinet was being changed and, before taking office, Nuri gave me encouraging assurances about his policy. He under took to co-operate fully in carrying out all our military plans in Iraq, to reorganise the army and purge it of pro-nazism, to intern the chief anti-British agitators : and to eliminate anti-British teaching from the schools. 21 . These points were reaffirmed in the Speech from the Throne at the opening of Parliament on the 1 st November, and the Prime Minister has already set his hand to the plough. The Chief of the General Staff has been removed and replaced by a better man. Forty troublesome men have been sent to the internment camp at Fao and a special committee has been set up in the Ministry | of Education to review the history text-books in use in the schools. (These books have in the past frequently contained matter intended to cultivate hatred of all British institutions in the Middle East.) Further action on these lines may be hoped for in the near future. 22. The Regent paid an official visit to Kerbela and Najaf between the 16th and 18th October. He was well received and the ulema of the Holy Shrines are reported to have assured him of their full support for his policy of close alliance and friendship with Great Britain. This visit, coupled with the appointment of a Shiah Minister of the Interior, which I have mentioned above, has caused some discontent among the Sunnis, who fear the loss of the predominant position hitherto enjoyed by their sect. Those who are hostile to British influence have been quick to allege that the Shiahs owe their improved ' political position to the British and to make this allegation an argument for I supporting Rashid Ali and his Nazi friends. This line of propaganda has not yet made much headway, but it needs to be watched. 23. Two royal visitors arrived in October : the Amir Zaid from Turkey, on the 13th October, and the Amir Abdullah from Amman, on the 25th October. The Amir Abdullah’s visit was attended by full ceremonial, both in Bagdad and Basra, and the talks which His Highness had with a very large number of people undoubtedly have done good. He was outspoken in his condemnation of the Rashid Ali regime and in his belief in the advantages to the Arabs of friendship [24—35] b 24 and alliance with Great Britain: so far as is known, he studiously refrained from pressing any claim to the throne of Syria. He returned to Amman on the 6 th November with an enhanced reputation amongst the moderate elements. The Amir Zaid is living quietly in his own house and is expected to remain in Bagdad for some time. 24. A serious situation was threatened in the Sin jar early in September, The Quaimmaqam went out with some police to stop a fight between two villages and was accidentally killed by a stray bullet. Difficulties with the Yezidis of the Sinjar had begun in June with the return from a prolonged absence in Syria of a troublesome chieftain named Daud-i-Daud. Afraid lest past misdeeds might still be remembered against him he omitted to pay his respects to the local authorities, who in consequence were disposed to regard him as a potential rebel. The difficulty was overcome by the intervention of the Adviser to the Ministry of the Interior, but the Qaimmaqam of the Sinjar then embarked on a policy of provocation while the Mutasarrif of Mosul whose dislike of the Yezidis is notorious, pressed the Central Government to repress vigorously the unrest to which the Qaimmaqam’s conduct led. Consequently when the Qaimmaqam was killed the Mutasarrif made the most of his opportunity to demand the exemplary punishment of the whole area. Iraqi troops were hurried to the spot and it seemed possible that the Government would embark on a general punitive expedition of the kind which had more than once disgraced their handling of the Yezidis in the past. I hastened to urge calm and moderation, and my efforts were supported by the Adviser to the Ministry of the Interior, who persuaded the Minister to resist the Mutusarrif’s demand and personally to visit Mosul to bring about a reasonable settlement. Thanks to the efforts of the adviser, who went with the Minister to Mosul, the leading Yezidi chieftains came in to Mosul to make their submission. The section responsible for the skirmish in which the Qaimmaqam was killed paid a fine of 1,000 dinars and undertook to surrender the men responsible for firing on the Qaimmaqam. After this settlement most of the Iraqi troops were withdrawn from the Sinjar but some remained at the Qadha headquarters and in the middle of October nearly caused a grave incident by carrying out night operations in the neighbourhood of a village without giving warning of their intentions. Troops in the Sinjar are unnecessary and provocative, and I have pressed the Government to have them withdrawn. 25. Another constant cause of trouble in the Sinjar is the Yezidi feud with the Shammar Jarba* Not only does this lead to raids and counter-raids between the two people but it also results in incessant intrigues by the Shammar with the Iraqi officials against the Tezidis. An exceptionally good Mutasarrif is needed in Mosul to deal with these difficulties. Tahain Ali’s anti-Yezidi and pro-Shammar bias was unfortunate. Tahain Ali has now joined Nuri Said’s Cabinet and everything possible must be done to find a fair-minded and competent successor. 26. One of the most difficult problems which the Iraqi Government has now to face is that of the steadily increasing cost of living. The extent to which prices have risen recently is shown by the examples given below :— Retail Prices. Flour ... Local bread ... European bread (rolls) Meat ... Ghee ... Sugar ... Matches Calico (unbleached) ... Calico (bleached) Cotton flannel Kerosene Salt Limes... Prices in August 1941. 60 fils per hugga (9 lbs.) 16 fils per waqiya (kilo)... 2^ fils each 40 fils per waqiya 640 fils per hugga 40 fils per kilo 40 fils per dozen ... 16 fils per dera (f yd.) ... 24 fils per dera ... 25 fils per dera ... 116 fils per tin 20 fils per charak (13 lbs.) 8 fils per waqiya Prices in November 1941 80 fils per hugga. 28 fils per waqiya. 4 fils each. 48 fils per waqiya. 740 fils per hugga. 72 fils per kilo. 60 fils per dozen. 36 fils per dera. 50 fils per dera. 50 fils per dera. 128 fils per tin. 40 fils per charak. 12 fils per waqiya. To understand the full hardship of war prices, it is necessary, however, to make a comparison between the prices of 1939 and those of the present day Ghee in 1939 was only 240-280 fils a hugga; meat 28-30 fils a waqiya ; sugar 16-18 fils a hugga; and matches only 16 fils a dozen. This rise in prices has caused much hardship to the poorer classes and serious discontent may result unless meansa 5 plnth \ T ’ q : esseiiLiai articles as tea, sugar, nour aim k u y i feai( ^ s Cabinet are not neglecting this question and already measures e een a'en which are having a beneficial effect. These measures include the plnf/° U ]V^ ^°q C ost suc ^ essent i a l articles as tea, sugar, flour and hnv b u y i 1 ~ aic ^ s Cabinet are not neglecting this question and already measures ^announcement of the purchase of large quantities of wheat, sugar, tea, coffee and jpex i es Tom India, and I have been asked to help the Iraqi Government to find emppmg for these necessary supplies. 7 ~ *7 . . -LWi VAipiuillciLIC 111 tmo UUUI 1 LI y used for Axis activities. Cypher facilities were withdrawn from the a^egation on the 27th August and, after much procrastination, the Japanese Minister was persuaded to leave early in September. The last of the Japanese community followed him shortly afterwards, and apart from a small egation staff there are now no Japanese in Iraq. Cypher facilities were with- iawn from the Vichy Irench Legation on the 17th August, and since Nuri Said s Government came into office ways and means of persuading both the French and Japanese Governments to withdraw their legations have been under consideration. t ^ ie i( ? ea the y mi ght be persuaded to do this if he published a statement making it clear that their diplomatic missions were no longer welcome. He accordingly gave an interview to Reuters (published on the 29th October), in the course of which he referred to the reprehensible conduct last May of two Governments with legations in Bagdad, one of which provided arms to the rebel Government and allowed Axis aeroplanes to use territory under its control, while the other financed the rebellion with Axis money. The Vichy and Japanese Governments cannot have failed to see where the cap fitted, but up to the present they do not appear to have decided what, if anv, action to take to meet this statement. 29. Relations with Saudi Arabia have been passing through one of their periodic phases of difficulty. The Shammar of Najd, who were sent back across the border in 1940 in accordance with the understandings reached at Raudha-al- Tanha in April of that year, have evaded the Saudi authorities and found their way back to Iraq. King Abdul Aziz is demanding that they should be expelled again, but the Iraqi Government are slow to do this, because they feel that it was the Saudi Government’s business to have kept them in Saudi territory if they did not wish them to break away back into Iraq. The unsettled question of the demarcation of the frontier at Judaidat-al-Arar also remains a cause of friction. 30. I have spoken to the Prime Minister of the importance of preserving good relations with Saudi Arabia, and I hope that the Iraqi Government, with the help of the Adviser to the Ministry of the Interior, will soon be able to put forward practical and conciliatory proposals for a further attempt to settle these and other outstanding differences. i 31. One of the basic causes of trouble with Saudi Arabia is that, whereas King Abdul Aziz is always intensely interested in desert politics, the Iraqi Government persistently neglect their Bedouin tribes and are only awakened to activity when a crisis occurs. So soon as this has passed they relapse into indifference, leaving the desert people to their own ways until the next crisis makes a further demand for official action. 32. After the British and Free French forces had completed the occupation of the French Mandated Territories in the Levant, the Iraqi Government began to show renewed interest in the future of these territories, and especially in^the establishment of the independence of Syria. At the end of July the Minister for Foreign Affairs addressed an official communication to me in which, after recalling the undertakings given by His Majesty’s Government concerning the independence of that country and the long struggle of the Syrian people for liberty, he uro-ed that His Majesty’s Government should themselves supervise the procedure^by which satisfaction would be given to Syria’s national aspirations through the creation of a genuine national Government. The Iraqi Government also endeavoured to persuade King Abdul Aziz-al-Saud to join them in making representations to His Majesty’s Government with a view to hastening the establishment of Syrian independence. King Abdul Aziz did not agree to this proposal, but counselled patience and confidence in the pledges already given on this subject. 33. Shortly afterwards an inspired press campaign was opened the main themes of which were the hopelessness of expecting anything from the Free A*' throughout their period of office I maintained constant pressure on 1 ac * ai Government to prevent foreign diplomatic missions in this country pressure on6 French and the duty of Great Britain to right Syria’s wrongs. I told the Minister for Foreign Affairs that such articles were embarrassing to us and were playing straight into the hands of the Germans. The campaign was then stopped, but rumours and suspicions remained unabated until, on the 27th September, General Catroux announced the formation of an independent Syrian Republic, with Shaikh Taj-ud-Din as President. 34. In spite of the lead given by the Egyptian Government, the Iraqi Government have deliberately refrained from recognising the new republic. Nuri Said and his colleagues are, of course, willing to recognise Syrian independence, but maintain that they cannot recognise as President of a Syrian Republic a man who has been appointed without any reference to the wishes of the people. 35 . I should like, in conclusion, to refer briefly to the work of the political advisers. You will recall that towards the end of last June you approved proposals which I submitted to you for the appointment of political advisers to work under my direction with a view to enabling me to combat enemy activities by keeping in close touch with the tribes and of obtaining reliable information of political developments throughout the country. There are now two political advisers (with the rank of lieutenant-colonel), one for the North and one for the South, each with two assistant political advisers with the rank of major. They all tour constantly and maintain close and friendly relations, not only with the big tribal chiefs, but also with important notables in the towns and with the principal Iraqi officials, who, having known most of them of old as colleagues, welcome their collaboration and advice. Through the information which they send to me I am kept well informed of all that takes place, and I am thus in a position to take steps with the Government departments concerned to check maladministration and to counter the activities of subversive elements. The political advisers have also been able to give valuable help to the British military authorities in their dealings with the local Iraqi officials and have, in addition, maintained useful liaison with officers engaged in similar work both in Syria and Persia. This organisation works in close co-operation with my public relations depart ment, which has itself been expanded and strengthened, and I am satisfied that, together, they are a powerful influence for good in combating enemy propaganda and strengthening our own position in all parts of this country/ 36. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s representatives at Angora, Cairo, Tehran and Jedda, the Minister of State, Cairo, His Majesty’s High Commissioner for Jerusalem and Transjordan, the Governor-General of India, the Commander-in-Chief, India, General Headquarters, Middle East, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, the Political Agent, Koweit, and to His Majesty’s Consuls at Basra and Mosul.

Bagdad, July 11, 1941. ^ IN this despatch I continue the story of current political events from the % point__ at which I conclu ^djji}Lde.spaliih N(L_-148 of. the 6 th June. ,s ”” 2^ The Regent’s return on the 1 st June was not welcomed by all classes. boJT Rashid Ali’s forceful propaganda had made too deep an impression for so sudden , . a change of public feeling to be possible. The army and police were largely sullen and resentful, and the people .in the streets looked angrily at those who passed^ UA ^ 0 j 9 Xy on their return from greeting His Highness at the Palace. Sensitive observers i of public feeling forecast trouble and events soon justified them. Shooting,daXL looting and rioting began in the streets of Bagdad about 3 o’clock in the after noon ^ and continued spasmodically throughout the night. The next morning (2nd June) * the situation became steadily worse, and by about 10 o’clock the mob was out of hand, looting shops at will. Malicious persons deliberately encouraged attacks on Jews. A large number of Jewish shops and homes were looted and_sevexal hundred Jews were brutally murdered. The police force was for a time useless. Its discipline had been undermined by the political manipulations and fanatical propaganda of Rashid Ali’s regime, and officers and men joined recklessly with the mob in breaking into and looting shops and houses all over the town. The Lord Mayor who, pending the formation of a new Government, was still nominally in control, begged the Director-General of Police to use his reserves and to order them to clear the streets and shoot to kill, but the Director-General pleaded that he could not accept responsibility for such drastic action unless specific orders were given by the Regent. After some delay the Regent sent the order in writing and also arranged for the despatch of troops to take control. The soldiers did their work well. There was no more aimless firing into the air; their machine-guns swept the streets clear of people and quickly put a stop to looting and rioting. In those few hours, however, hundreds of families were ruined and brutal outrages committed which all right-minded persons will for long remember with vni were shame and horror. The Jews suffered most, and there is no doubt that a large number of them would emigrate rather than face the risk of another such pogrom if they could only find a country to take them. Many have made pathetic attempts to obtain visas for India for themselves or their families, only to find this way of escape now closed. 3 . There is evidence to show that the riots were instigated by certain officers in the army and police who took advantage of the temporary absence of responsible authority. Had a Government been formed earlier it is improbable that such a serious situation would have arisen. I had at my first interview with the Regent the previous day urged the extreme importance of forming a Cabinet at once, and I again impressed on him the necessity for immediate action when I saw him later that afternoon. The Regent was in a difficult position. Jamil Beg Madfai was the only apparent candidate. His name had been put forward by Arshad Beg at Umari and his temporary committee, and my enquiries failed to reveal anyone else who had the courage and influence to step into the breach. Jamil Beg, however, seemed to have no zest for the part. The Regent had been dissatisfied with his attitude during the later stages of their stay in Palestine, and knew that though generally sound in his views he was an ageing man lacking energy and purposefulness and too weak in character to be able to deal firmly with the problems which would face him. His Highness sought anxiously for alternatives, but found none, and was therefore obliged to call upon Jamil Beg to form a Cabinet. The latter refused and persisted in his refusal all that day. That night his friends brought pressure to bear on him and the following morning he sent the Lord Mayor and the present Minister of Finance to me with a message that he would accept if I would promise him my full m-n RECd. POL. OEPt. 19AUG 941 INDIA OFFICEsupport. This I promised to give, and he assumed office when the rioting was at its height. As every minute almost was of importance, the Regent gave him a free hand, and on the 3rd June the following appointments were announced :— Prime Minister : Jamil Madfai. Foreign Affairs : Ali Jaudat-al-Aiyubi. Interior : Mustafa-al-Umari. Communications and Works : Jalal Bahan. Finance and Justice : Ibrahim Kamal. Economics : Nasrat-al-Farisi. Education : Ridha-al-Shabibi. Social Affairs : Ja’far Hamudi (appointed a few days later). 4. The new Government had much to do. Their immediate tasks were to re-establish relations with His Majesty’s Government on the basis of the Treaty of Alliance of 1930, to punish rebels and rioters, to discipline the army, the police and the public services, to stamp out Axis propaganda and to change the heart of a great mass of the people. 5. For two or three days I had prolonged talks with the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs about the essential conditions of a good understanding with His Majesty’s Government, and then, after I had formally given notice that in the opinion of His Majesty’s Government a state of imminent danger of war had been reached, the Cabinet on the 5th June authorised the Minister for Foreign Affairs to communicate to me the following decisions :— (a) The Iraqi Government agree that for the duration of the war, and for war purposes alone, His Majesty’s Government may station their ground and air forces at such places as may be necessary for the defence of Iraq, subject to— ( 1 ) the Iraqi Government being notified as far as possible in advance; (2) due consideration being given to such observations as the Iraqi Government may make on account of local administrative necessities; (b) The Iraqi Government agree to establish a postal and telegraphic censor ship and to safeguard the interests of His Majesty’s Government in these matters by employing in the department concerned a British official from among those in the service of the Iraqi Government. (A later letter informed me that British interests in the control of aliens in Iraq would be safeguarded in a similar manner); {c) The Iraqi Government agree to the British military authorities exercising the necessary measure of control in co-operation with the Iraq? authorities over the base area at Basra and will issue orders to the Basra port authorities to co-operate fully regarding all measures necessary to facilitate and ensure the safe arrival of British forces at Basra. I also received an oral assurance that relations with Italy would be broken off. 6 . The decision about our troops has, up to the present, given good results Our forces- have moved everywhere without opposition and, with few exceptions, friendly co-operation has been given by the Iraqi police, military and civil officials. News of all movements is passed to the Ministry of Defence through the remaining officers of the Advisory Military Mission who now act as connecting link between Force Headquarters and the Ministry of Defence. 7. The press and postal censorship is beginning to get into its stride and with the tactful use of the trained staff which the Middle East Command is providing, it should become more effective before long. 8 . Details of the British co-operation which it is desirable to establish at Basra, both in the port and the base areas, are being studied, and in the mean while the provisional arrangements in operation are working reasonably well 9 - Relations with Italy were formally broken off on the 8 th June and the Italian Minister and his staff left for Turkey via Syria on the following dav The Japanese Military Attache installed during May has been obliged to leave and the Japanese Government have been informed that their present minister is persona non grata to the Regent. • 10 w T f dea ] ^ith the worst rebels and rioters, military courts have been set up in Mosul and Bagdad, and a large number of persons, including manv of Rashid Ah s outstanding supporters, have been summarily arrested A new3 director-general of police has been appointed, and many army officers have been placed on pension. Troublesome Palestinians and Syrian teachers have been packed oh to their homes and new mutassarrifs have been appointed to most liwas. These measures have to some extent improved the situation, but they have not been carried out with enough energy to make them fully effective. 11 The departure of the Mufti and the Italian Legation has deprived pro-Axis and anti-British propaganda of its motive force, but the adherents of Rashid Ali, the many convinced pro-Xazis in the army and the public services, and the iireco'iwable anti-British elements in all parts of the country, are main taining a widespread opposition to the Government and their endeavours to cultivate a public spirit more friendly towards Great Britain. 12 . The Government began their own propaganda campaign very warily, and I had much to do to persuade them to quicken and strengthen it. Gradually they gained confidence and by the end of June, both in the press and on the radio, they were attacking their opponents with good effect. Their handling of the soldiers and officials has been less successful and too many prominent supporters of Rashid Ali's regime have been released from prison after only a few days’ detention. The Government are now talking of an internment camp for the worst of their political opponents and this seems to be the only solution of a difficult problem. The Government are also collecting evidence for impeachment of Rashid Ali and his Cabinet for treason and have taken powers to try them in absentia. Up to the present no action has been taken against Rashid Ali’s chief tribal supporters, a fact which is causing resentment among those who remained loyal to the Regent. 13. The Government have made a creditable attempt to improve their representation abroad. The minister at Angora, the charge d’affaires at Kabul, the consul-general at Beirut and several consuls and secretaries known for their pro-German activities have been recalled and a new minister has been sent to Tehran, who, it is hoped, will bring pressure to bear on the Iranian Government to impose effective restrictions on Rashid Ali, the Mufti, the Golden Square and their followers, now refugees in Iran., 14. Southern Kurdistan is providing a further difficult problem for an already much-embarrassed Administration. Sheikh Mahmud, the outstanding Kurdish tribal leader, escaped from his forced detention in Bagdad towards the end of May. From 1923 until his surrender in 1931 he fought continuously against all established authority, British or Iraqi, in the name of Kurdish independence, and ten years of exile from his own hills have evidently wrought little change in his proud and unruly character. After his escape he returned to his old haunts in Sulaimania and, having gathered fighting men around him. was about to attack Sulaimani when the Rashid Ali Government fell. The restoration by British forces of a constitutional Government offered a prospect of sympathetic British intervention in Kurdish interests and Sheikh Mahmud held off his attack to see what could be gained by negotiation. The Government thereupon sent a Kurdish official. Mustafa Qaradaghli, to talk with him and, at the same time, collected forces in Sulaimani as a warning. Sheikh Mahmud’s proposals included j the transfer to the Kurds themselves of the control of law and order, the administration of the Kurdish districts through a locally appointed committee ,of Kurds and the creation of a special voluntarily enlisted force for garrison /duties in the Kurdish districts. These proposals were unacceptable to the Iraqi Government, who saw in them a long first step towards Kurdish autonomy. They also felt, with good reason, that Sheikh Mahmud, with his out-of-date tribal outlook on political questions and his treacherous nature, was not a man with iwhom any lasting arrangements could be concluded. They therefore adopted the plan of detaching his tribal allies by offers of concession to their local interests and of depriving him of any support which the educated Kurds might otherwise give to him by attempting to redress their grievances. The Kurds have long complained of the deliberate neglect of the Bagdad Government and there is a widespread feeling that the present moment is propitious to extort concessions. Some Kurds go so far as to dream of autonomy, while others would be satisfied with real equality within the Iraqi State. Some, like Sheikh Mahmud, still apparently hope that Great Britain will even yet see that the Kurds have a fair deal and are never tired of telling us how much better friends they would have been to us than the Arabs, for whom we have done so much and from whom we have received so little gratitude. Others take the line that the Kurds obviously do not fit into British policy and that it would be foolish to expect us to upset the4 Arabs for the blue eyes of the Kurds, and that if ever they are to have a future as a nation they must fight for it themselves. The Iraqi plan for dealing with the immediate manifestation of this chronic element of internal unrest is in principle sound, and if carried out in a generous and sympathetic spirit will probably succeed. But the Prime Minister is bigotedly anti-Kurd, and unlikely A to handle the problem with friendliness and foresight. The adviser to the^ Ministry of the Interior, an expert in Kurdish affairs, tells me that in discussions with Iraqi politicians he frequently senses in some of them a vindictive feeling that they would prefer to lose Kurdistan rather than secure them as loyal Iraqis by acknowledging their existence qua Kurds; they are ready to contemplate evacuation of the Kurdistan areas but never a really liberal policy. Sheikh Mahmud sent a confidential messenger to me with good wishes and protestations of obedient friendship towards His Majesty’s Government. I returned thanks with a pointed reminder that in this time of war His Majesty’s Government did not wish to be burdened with troubles in Iraq, and that in the large British forces now in Iraq they had the means to put a stop to any such embarrassments to their war effort. For the moment the situation is quiet; Sheikh Mahmud has promised to disperse his armed band and the Government have given him permission to live in one of his villages near Sulaimani. It cannot be hoped, however, that this truce will last for long. 15. People of all classes in Iraq continue to follow external events with close interest, but recent war developments have not greatly influenced Iraq’s internal affairs. The Free French declaration of the independence of Syria and the Lebanon made on the 6 th June and the declaration of His Majesty’s Govern ment associating themselves therewith were both well received and well advertised by the Iraqi Government, These statements of policy gave confidence to our friends but did not appreciably change the views of the solid mass of our obstinate enemies. Your own Mansion House statement on British policy towards the Arabs and their national aspirations made an excellent impression at the time, but it is, I fear, now beginning to be forgotten and it would be good from all points of view that an early opportunity should be sought to have it recalled and repeated in an authoritative manner. Germany’s attack on Russia is regarded by many as increasing British chances of victory, but the pro-Germans have been working hard to convince everybody that Russia will quickly collapse and leave the road to India open to the German army. 16. To sum up the general situation I would say that though they have made some progress the Government have not yet consolidated their position. The tribes are quiescent and their leaders are for the most part friendly, but the army is a potential element of danger. There the bitterness of defeat still kindles the fires of hatred of the British under the ashes of appeasement, and news of the eastern march of German forces might well be taken as a signal for a fresh attempt to destroy our position in this country. I am myself taking all possible steps to make such a possibility more remote. After a long period of ostracism, the way to the Embassy is now open and I have visitors—tribal and others—from all over the country. With the reorganisation of our propaganda machine and the activities of the newly-formed Political Advisory Staff, I have hopes of regaining an appreciable portion of the ground which we have lost throughout the country. Much will depend on the length of the present respite and on the course of the war, but, granted reasonably good fortune, I see no reason why we should not be able to place ourselves in a far stronger position to resist any subversive attack against us from within the country in the future. The future of the Regent and of his Government is linked with ours in this matter. I am' doing what I can to strengthen them and have enlisted then- support for my plans. 17.

Sir, Bagdad, June 6 , 1941. *oSk&gt; WITH reference t o my despatch No. 143 of the 28th April, I have the honour to submit the followingTeport on events in Iraq from the arrival in Basra in the middle of April of the first convoy of British troops from India down to the signing of the armistice between the British and Iraqi forces on the 31st May. 2. So soon as the troops had disembarked, Rashid Ali began to press hard for the full recognition of the new regime by His Majesty’s Government and the early movement of the newly arrived British forces along the lines of communica tion which they had come to open. I made it clear that His Majesty’s Government would not give full recognition until the new Government had shown by their acts that they were really friendly, explaining that full discretion must be given to the General Officer Commanding to organise the lines of communication in accordance with military requirements. This second point was also discussed with the Iraqi Chief of General Staff by the General Officer Commanding, Basra, when he visited Bagdad on the 23rd April. He emphasised the need of time for the proper organisation of a base, and explained that a battalion of British troops was being flown from Basra to Habbaniya. He also told the Chief of General Staff of the probable arrival within a few days of a few more ships carrying men belonging to the formation which had already disembarked. The Chief of General Staff received this news well, but urged that something should be done quickly to show that we had no idea of keeping troops permanently at Basra. 3 . On the 25th April, acting on your instructions, I called on the Minister for Foreign Affairs and informed him that, in view of Rashid Ali’s friendly assurances regarding his general policy and of the co-operation shown by the Iraqi authorities in connexion with the landing of our troops at Basra, I had been authorised to enter into formal relations with the new Administration forth with. I added that I had your authority to express the hope that further co-operation by the Iraqi Administration might provide evidence of their desire to fulfil the Anglo-Iraqi Alliance and thereby soon enable formal relations to be established. 4. Musa Shahbandar expressed his friendship for Great Britain and pro mised to use all his efforts to bring about an improvement in Anglo-Iraqi relations. He pressed hard, however, for early and full recognition and for the quick passage through Iraq of the troops which had been landed at Basra. He also spoke of the harm that had been done to our mutual relations by our failure to reassure the Arabs about the future of Palestine. An official communique on my call was published the following morning in the press. The key-note of the newspaper articles at this time was that, though Iraq would honour her word by allowing British troops to pass through Iraq, the Government were ready and determined to resist any attempt to violate the country’s sovereignty and independence. 5 . In the meanwhile the Iraqi reinforcements, which had been sent to Basra at the time of the arrival of the first convoy of British troops, were being with drawn to Musayib and Bagdad, and one infantry brigade and one artillery brigade were brought down to Bagdad from Kirkuk. 6 . The deduction to be made from these movements seemed to be that the Iraqi military commanders had given up any idea of holding Basra, but were taking steps to be in a position to see Bagdad securely under their control and to act against Habbaniya, if they wished to do so. 7 . On the 28th April I sent my counsellor to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs to give notice of the impending arrival at Basra of three ships carrying about 2,000 men (of whom some 1,600 were non-combatant) belonging to the units and formations which had already arrived. About noon I received a message by■2 &amp; troops 0 ' 6 that th6 Ilaqi Government were unable to agree to the arrival of these , at . on&lt; T a *ked for an interview with Kashid Ali, and he received me at the • erai at 4 o clock m the afternoon. The Minister for Foreign Affairs was also present. They said that the Cabinet had considered the arrival of the three troop ships and had resolved to adhere to their previous decision that no more troops should land before those which had already arrived had begun to pass on out of t le country (see paragraph 14 of m y despatch No. 143 of the 28th April, mil ... * le y tested that, however widely article 4 was interpreted it could not possibly be hdd to give His Majesty’s Government the right to maintain any ces in Iraq, even m war time, other than the guards required for the treatv air bases. The retention of a British force at Basra was, they claimed a vioE of the treaty and would not be tolerated by the Iraqi people.' Public opinion was a icady much upset by the fact that no transport arrangements had been made to mov e on any of the units which had been landed, and it was quite impossible for the authorities to consent to further arrivals, unless they could point to a !:‘° n '. e ?E. 0nduig exodus ,- As I reported at the time in my telegram No. 409. I did y utmost to persuade them to take a more reasonable view of the provisions of the treaty and of the troops required to organise a line of communications but I was unable to move them. I warned them, nevertheless, that the ships’would wmukTte serTous° a ' d conse( l uences of opposition or obstruction 1° Rashid Ali specifically stated that, if the troops were disembarked before the despatch northwards of those already in Basra, he would broadcast a sihTfWtl 011 ° f ° Ur aCtl ° n n . a V on He added that he could not be respon- sdi e for the consequences which might follow the inevitable outburst of popular teeling. His attitude in general was so unsatisfactory and the danger of a clash between British and Iraqi forces appeared so imminent, that I decided to order the immediate evacuation of all British women and children from Iraq o a li ■ 1 1 ) n f ormed the two Ministers of this decision on the following morning !, ootained from them a solemn assurance that all women and children would be allowed to leave the country in safety and that every facility would be given to enable them to do so. Plans for the evacuation of those in Bagdad were readv and were put into operation with success. All British and a number of other European and American women and children, numbering about 224 in all were marshaHed at the Bagdad Civil Air Port in the early afternoon of the 29th April trlk 1 U T R °y a i A I r Fo , rc , e motor buses &gt; lorries and ears to the air base at abbaniya. I am deeply indebted to the Air Officer Commanding and the officers untler his command for their valuable and wholehearted assistance in this matter n;™ P fl 1C p arra ? g ?^ S at the point of assembly were also excellent, and the irector-General oi I ohee W’as present himself to see that all went well The whole party arrived safely at its destination and the Air Officer Commanding prepared for its onward movement to Basra by air during the next three or four days. r . 1 vr P ! a ^ whieh had been made for evacuating British women and children 10 m Mosul Kirkuk and other centres were also put into effect, but I have not \et been able to obtain reports of the measure of success achieved 13. During the night of the 29th-30th April it was observed in Bagdad that the mechanised force of the Iraqi army under Lieutenant-Colonel Fahmi Kaid meludmg a quantity of mechanised artillery, moved out of its barracks in the Muaskar Kashid, and, having crossed the new King Faisal Bridge in Bagdad continued) to move m a westerly direction towards Falluia. This movement suggested a threat to the air base at Habbaniya, and it was reported to the Air Officer Commanding from the embassy by urgent telegram at about 2-30 a m on the morning of the 30th April. Some part, if not all, of this force was'in position commanding the Habbaniya air base by first light on the 30th April and shortly afterwards the Iraqi commander sent a message to the Air Officer Commanding demanding that there should be no flying nor any movement of forces outside the cantonment, and giving warning that the Iraqi authorities would shell aircraft attempting to take off from the aerodrome or armoured cars leaving the perimeter. I his action immediately placed the British women and children who had arrived at Habbaniya on the previous afternoon in a position of great danger; it was a direct breach of the assurance which had been given and an act of gross treachery. The Air Officer Commanding informed me of this3 ultimatum, and shortly after noon I sent a member of my staff to the Ministry lor ioreign Affairs with a written protest, coupled with a request that the Iraqi iorces should at once be withdrawn from the vicinity of Habbaniya. I adddd that, if this were not done, responsibility for the consequences would rest with the Iraqi authorities. 14. 1 he Iraqi reply claimed that the despatch of troops to Habbaniya was only a precaution taken in the face of the several threatening acts of His Majesty s Government, including the retention of forces at Basra, and made no reference to my request for the withdrawal of the Iraqi forces from the position wnich they had taken up around the air base. Throughout that day more artillery and infantry continued to march out to strengthen the Iraqi forces, and it became clear that it was their intention completely to surround and dominate the cantonment. 15. During the morning, as a precaution, I gave orders putting into operation an emergency scheme which brought about the protective concentration of the remaining British subjects within the precincts of the British Embassy and the American Legation. In all about 350 persons came to the embassy, and about half that number went to the American Legation. 16. The following day, the 1 st May, passed quietly. The next step lav with the Air Officer Commanding, and, apart from assuring him that I would fully support any action which he might decide to take to deal with the situation at Habbaniya. there was nothing which I could do. During the course of the day he informed me that he had determined to issue an ultimatum to the Officer Commanding Iraqi Forces early the next morning, demanding the instant with drawal of the forces surrounding his camp, and stating that he would attack if their withdrawal did not begin at once. In the evening I heard from him that the Iraqi forces had increased to such an extent, and had not only taken up artillery positions dominating his camp, but had penetrated after dusk into Humfriyah, lying just outside the perimeter of the cantonment, with the result that he had decided to attack at 5 a.m. without giving any warning. A few minutes after this attack was due to begin I sent to Rashid Ali a written communication, informing him that, as no response had been made to my request for the withdrawal of Iraqi forces from the vicinity of Habbaniya,' and as T moreover, the Iraqi army continued to concentrate increasingly large forces with hostile intent in the vicinity of the British air base, the Air Officer Commanding had been compelled to take appropriate action. I also warned him that, if the British Embassy or the American Legation were threatened, or if any harm were done to British subjects in Bagdad or elsewhere in Iraq, the Air Officer Commanding would at once take appropriate action. In their reply the Ministry for Foreign Affairs stated that they regarded the action of the Air Officer Commanding as a clear act of hostility directed against the rights and safety of the country. From this time onward the embassy was cut off from all telephonic communication except with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, and no further cypher telegrams from the embassy were accepted for transmission at the Central Telegraph Office. I was, however, in wireless communication until late on the night of the 2nd May. In addition, the embassy was surrounded by Iraqi police, and, in spite of the fact that in principle diplomatic relations had not been severed, no British subject was allowed to enter or leave the embassy precincts. 17. Appropriate pamphlets had already been drafted by His Majesty’s Embassy in advance for distribution by such means as might be available. The texts had been telegraphed to the British military authorities at Cairo and the High Commissioner at Jerusalem in order that they might be distributed by aeroplane at the proper moment. Between 6 and 7 a.m. on the 2nd May His Majesty’s Embassy took what steps were possible to arrange for a limited distribution of pamphlets in Bagdad itself in co-operation with air distributiin which actually took place on the following day. 18. I think it necessary at this point to describe the state of tension which existed, especially during the first two days after fighting had begun. It had been considered by my military advisers that the bulk of the Iraqi army had no desire to fight against us, and that it would retreat in disorder after the first serious bombing attack. It is possible that this opinion was not confined to British circles, and the result of the initial fighting was no doubt unexpectedly heartening to Rashid Ali and the army commanders. Their forces had resisted the first onslaught of the great British Empire, and they had reason to hope for [19—44] b 24 early and effective help from the Axis. For a brief intoxicating moment they felt themselves to be, and were hailed as, the leaders of a great Arab risorgimento. By propaganda, which employed all the tricks of the most up-to-date European models, the Government succeeded in infecting public opinion in Bagdad with something of their own high-strung reaction to the crisis. Public opinion in Iraq, as in all countries without intellectual habits, depends on public feeling, and the de facto Government did everything they could think of to play on the emotions of the people By impassioned harangues broadcast in every coffee-shop, by poems, speeches and sermons, by martial music and processions of youth, they strove to stir up a patriotic and religious fervour for the struggle upon which they had embarked and to embitter the hearts of the people against Great Britain. I do not yet know to what extent they succeeded elsewhere, but in Bagdad they aroused popular excitement and enthusiasm to a high pitch. In such circum stances the safety of the British lives under my care in the embassy was a grave anxiety. few rifles, a supply of ammunition and a small quantity of tear-gas bombs had been collected in the Chancery, and under the direction of Major-General Waterhouse and two officers of the British Military Mission these arms were distributed' and the defence of the building organised. With these limited resources it was hoped that it would be possible to beat off any sudden attempt that might be made by a rabble to break into the premises, but it was of course clear that a few untrained men with rifles could not hope to defend the embassy against an organised attack, whether by Iraqi armed forces or by semi- organised civilian insurgents like the Palestinian mujahidin. 19. Our first line of defence was the police, of whom about twenty had been posted at our gates. Our own emergency defences could not be expected to hold out for long if the police failed. Apart from this dependence on the dc facto authorities for protection, we were also dependent on them for electricity, water and all food and medical supplies The reserves of food which had been collected in the embassy were soon reduced to a dangerously low level, and the large daily deliveries of fresh food and other supplies needed to maintain in health the 350 men, women and children of several different races who took refuge in my house could only be obtained through the goodwill and good offices of the authorities. I was obliged, therefore, to be more circumspect in my dealings with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs than I should have been had I been responsible only for the safety and welfare of a small official staff. I naturally assume full responsibility for every decision which I took, but I would add that I carefully considered each question as it arose in consultation with the senior members of my staff and with senior officials, such as General Waterhouse, the head of the British Military Mission, and Mr. Edmonds, advisor to the Ministry of the Interior. We were, and still are, of the opinion that during the first two days the fate of the embassy and of those living in it hung in the balance, and that the Iraqi authorities, deceived by their apparent success, were prepared to proceed to any lengths in the enforce ment of their demands. We were dealing not with a properly constituted Government which, even though hostile, could be relied upon to observe the recognised procedure of international law, but with a number of desperate men in league with the Axis Powers. The fact that successful operations round Habbaniya and the bombing of the military camps near Bagdad later induced the authorities to adopt a more moderate tone has not caused us to modify our opinion. My acquiescence in certain of the Iraqi demands referred to in the following paragraphs must necessarily be viewed in the light of the situation which had just been described. 20 . In view of the danger of the situation, on the 2 nd May I gave instruc tions for all secret archives and most cyphers to be burnt. I am sending a separate despatch giving details of the cyphers and other documents so destroyed. 21 . Late in the evening ( 2 nd May) I received a note from the’Ministry for Foreign Affairs demanding the dismantling of the wireless transmitter’ and receiver which up to that time had been in use in the embassy. Apart from the rights of His Majesty’s Government under article 3 of the annexure to the Anglo- Iraqi Treaty—and in this case the wireless apparatus was manned by the Royal Air Force personnel for the maintenance of wireless communication between the Air Officer Commanding and His Majesty’s Embassy—I was very doubtful whether I could in any circumstances claim a right in international law to use a wireless apparatus, particularly as British forces were then fighting the forces of the de facto Government. The latter could justly assume tliat the apparatuswould be used for military purposes, and the Iraqi military authorities would be more than likely to back up their demand by force. I was most anxious that Iraqi forces should not enter the embassy precincts and thus have the opportunity of remaining there permanently. In any case the wireless apparatus could not be worked without the continued supply of electric current which was under the control of the local authorities. In the circumstances I felt obliged to yield. In reply to the Ministry’s note I pointed out, however, that their demand was a contravention of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty, and I disclaimed all responsibility for the consequences which might ensue from compliance therewith, unless at the same time the Iraqi authorities granted facilities for the prompt despatch of telegrams from the embassy to all destinations through the Central Telegraph Office. 22 . The next day the Ministry sent a second note on this subject informing me that it had been decided to confiscate all wireless apparatus in the use of foreign diplomatic missions, and asking me to surrender the apparatus which had been erected in the embassy. At the same time I was informed that the Ministry were prepared to accept from the embassy en clair telegrams for transmission from the telegraph office. As the transmitter and receiver had already been dismantled. I decided not to resist this second demand, and was prepared to hand over the apparatus to the representatives of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Defence who had come to take delivery. The representatives were not content, however, with surrender, but insisted on searching the Chancery buildings. I only acquiesced under the strongest protest and seized the opportunity to press for the restoration of domestic electric current which had, in the meanwhile, been completely cut off, thereby endangering the health of the large number of people living in the house and Chancery. (The danger to health was serious because the clearing of the septic tank which receives all the sewage of the embassy is entirely dependent on an electrically-operated pump.) My representations were successful and the supply of current was not again interrupted. 23. Later in the day a further demand was sent to me to allow representa tives of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and of the Ministry of Defence to search not only the Chancery building, but also every room in the embassy house, and satisfy themselves that there was no other apparatus in our possession. In spite of this further flagrant infraction of diplomatic immunity from search, I had no other alternative but to accept the demand, under strong protest. Another small transmitter set, which was not in use. was discovered, and, with my consent, removed. 24. On the same day the Ministry for Foreign Affairs sent yet another note, stating that the flying of the British flag over the embassy at a time when Britain was waging war on Iraq would increase public excitement and, it was feared, provoke a regrettable incident. The Ministry, therefore, asked that the flag should not be flown. The position was not wholly free from doubt. I was advised that it could not necessarily be claimed that foreign diplomatic missions have a prescriptive right to fly their national flag daily over the buildings which they occupy. The usual custom was for missions to fly the flag only on their own national days or on the national days of the countries of residence. In Bagdad, for some reason, possibly dating from high commission days, a departure had been made from this custom, and the embassy and all foreign legations were in the habit of flying their flags daily throughout the year. To depart from this custom was a grave step, but I felt that in the special circumstances there might be some justification in the Iraqi Government’s contention that the flying of the Union Jack in the heart of the capital at that moment was provocative, and would render more difficult the authorities’ task of protecting the embassy from danger of a mob attack. I felt also that there was every prospect that the authorities might themselves incite such an attack or send in an armed party to remove the flag themselves. I decided, therefore, unobtrusively to remove the Union Jack from the flagstaff on the roof of the embassy, where it ordinarily flies, and to hoist it from a staff in the grounds, where it would not be visible outside. 25. Another incident which marked the day was a request made orally by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs that the British managers of the Imperial Bank of Iran and the Eastern Bank, who were both in the embassy, should be asked to hand over their keys to the Iraqi authorities. The Ministry stated that the British manager of the Ottoman Bank (who had taken refuge in the American Legation) had agreed to hand over the keys of his bank on condition that the managers of the two other banks also agreed to do so. If the managers refusedto hand over their keys the authorities would open the banks by force. After consulting with myself and the adviser to the Ministry of the Intel ior, the two managers in the embassy decided to authorise their representatives in the United States Legation to hand over their keys under protest in the face of force majeuve. Whether the surrender of the keys actually took place I was unaware, as no contact existed between His Majesty’s hmbassy and the l nited Leo-ation. Details of the manner in which this action was taken, and of the situation of the banks under the control of Rashid All’s Administration, will be reported in a separate despatch. 26. The 4th May was a second eventful day. In the early morning Wellington bombers were seen from the embassy dropping leaflets over the city. Shortly afterwards an official in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs telephoned to tell a member of my staff that these leaflets contained a threat that the Govern ment offices in Bagdad would be bombed unless the Iraqi forces were withdrawn from Habbaniya within four hours. The official said that he had been instructed to inform the embassy that the Iraqi forces would not be withdrawn and that, if the Government offices in Bagdad were bombed, the Iraqi Air Force would retaliate by bombing all places inhabited by the British. This, of course, was tantamount to a threat to bomb His Majesty’s Embassy and the United State* Legation, where so many British subjects were congregated, and constitutes a further example of the flagrant disregard by the Iraqi authorities of interna tional law and custom. This message was afterwards confirmed in a note from the Ministry. . « T i i j 27. The threat made in these leaflets came as a surprise, for I had under stood that all ideas of bombing other than military targets had been dropped. I had already made it clear by telegram to the British military authorities on 1 st May that I was strongly opposed to such action. As I saw it, the bombing of the'Government offices would have united public opinion throughout Iraq against us, and aroused the fury of the Bagdad mob without in an\ wa\ alteimg the militarv situation at Habbaniya. I therefore addressed an urgent telegram to the Air Officer Commanding,' Middle East, the Air Officer Commanding. Habbaniya. and the General Officer Commanding, Basra, recalling my opinion that the bombing of civilians was undesirable. This telegram was sent off en clair through the Iraqi civil telegraph office. 28. Hardly had this action been taken- before a police inspector arrived at the embassy gates with a note from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs asking that all Iraqi subjects within the embassy should be expelled and handed over to the inspector in charge of the police guard. It mav have been that the Iiaqi authorities were anxious to withdraw Iraqis from the danger zone of the British Embassv in case it were to be bombed, but I feared that the underlying purpose of this'request was to get hold of all the Iraqi servants and to victimise them for having served the British, and I decided to reject it. A member of my staff discussed the matter with the Ministry by telephone, making my attitude clear, and was then informed that the reason for the request was that the wives of some men employed in the embassy had petitioned the Ministry, alleging that their menfolk were being forcibly detained and asking for their release. When it was explained that all Iraqis'were free to leave, if they wished to do so, the Ministry were satisfied with a list of their names. I have a feeling, however, that the demand would have been pressed had it not been for the timely bombing of the military camps near Bagdad that morning. 29. The'next event was the unexpected arrival of M. Ustum, my Turkish colleague. He came to acquaint me with bis Government’s offer of good offices to find a solution of the dispute between Great Britain and Iraq. He also told me that he had been invited by the Iraqi Ministry for Foreign Affairs to suggest that it was desirable that the action threatened in the leaflets dropped earlier in the morning should at all events be postponed so as to enable the Turkish offer to be considered in a favourably atmosphere. I showed him a copy of my telegram about bombing civilians, but explained that as I was cut off from all confidential communication with my own Government I was unable to express to them my views concerning the Turkish Government’s offer. This visit, however, gave me the opportunity of explaining to M. Ustum the various humiliations to which His Majesty’s Embassy was being subjected, with the request that his Government should be fully informed. Forty-eight hours later M. Ustum paid me another visit, complaining that he was unable to withdraw certain funds from,550 7 the Ottoman Bank. He said that he had seen the Iraqi Minister, who had given him permission to visit me with the suggestion that the British bank managers should resume their functions under self-conduct, and this His Majesty’s Govern ment should provide sufficient funds to meet the liabilities of the British banks. ** I informed M. Ustum that I was not in touch with my Government, and that if he desired any action taken the Turkish Government siiould raise the matter in London. M. Ustum confirmed to me that he had acted on the request made to him by me at the conclusion of our previous meeting. 30. The next day, the 5th May, passed quietly, but in the evening the Ministry for Loreign Affairs again became active. They began with a telephone message informing me that the Iraqi authorities were willing to remove all British and Iraqi women and children from the danger zone at Habbaniya and asking for a list of names. I sent a reply explaining that the Air Officer Commanding at Habbaniya was responsible for the women and children in his cantonment and that any decision regarding them must rest with him. 1 suggested, therefore, that the commander of the Iraqi troops in the vicinity should be instructed to communicate the Iraqi Government’s offer to the Air Officer Commanding direct. At the same time, I addressed an en clair telegram to the Air Officer Commanding informing him of the offer and leaving the reply entirely to his discretion. Two days later he sent a message by aeroplane telling me that, having forced the enemy to retire, he had been able to arrange to send the women and children to Basra by air without the need for Iraqi co-operation. 31. The next step on the part of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs was to send a note stating that the Iraqi Government had decided to establish control over the property of foreigners and to take over all the motor cars within the embassy except those belonging to members of the diplomatic staff. The Ministry asked that all these motor cars should be handed over at once to officials who had been sent to take them away. I decided to insist this demand to the utmost limit, and in my reply I asked to be informed under what law the decision in question had been taken, warned the Ministry that, if control was established over British property in Iraq, His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom would certainly take similar action against the property of Iraqi subjects in all terri tories under British rule, and finally pointed out that the demand made for the surrender of property located within the precincts of the embassy was a direct violation of international law. I am glad to say that I heard nothing more of this proposal. 32. Another note received from the Ministry late on the 5th May asked for a list of the names of all persons in the embassy of whatever nationality, accompanied by a certificate that it was complete, and an assurance that no one would be allowed to leave before the consent of the Iraqi authorities had been obtained. I replied asking to be informed of the purpose for which such a list was required, explained that all who were in the embassy had come voluntarily on my advice, and gave an assurance that so long as a state of emergency lasted I would, within the limits of my authority, continue to advise all concerned not to go outside the embassy grounds. There was, of course, no desire on the part of anyone to do so. This reply seems to have satisfied the Ministry, who did not again address me on this subject. 33. After the first few days, thanks largely to the help of the Protocol Department in the Ministry foi* Foreign Affairs, a regular and sufficient supply of food began to be delivered daily, and the efficient arrangements made bv voluntary workers made it possible for adequate, though simple, meals to be provided to all those who had been gathered within the embassy. Necessary medical stores were also obtained in the same manner. There were fortunately a number of doctors and nursing sisters among our community, and with their help the sick were looked after and! sanitary services organised to prevent epidemics. Owing to the efficient measures which were taken, the health of the community was throughout remarkably good. I should here like to pay a tribute to the civilian members of the community, who, under the direction of the military mission, were responsible for placing the embassy in a state of defence and for providing the necessary guards and patrols both by day and! night. 34 . The press attache’s staff distributed frequent news bulletins from material picked up from broadcasting stations, and a variety of entertainments and other distractions were organised to combat boredom. The spirit shown by the British community was altogether admirable.8 35. I have made no mention of the British aircraft which passed daily over Bagdad for scouting and demonstration purposes, to drop pamphlets or to bomb military targets in the neighbourhood. There is no doubt that this air action had a very salutary effect, not only on the Iraqi authorities, but also on the population of Bagdad, which might otherwise have got out of hand and constituted a serious menace to the British community. 36. The week between the 6 th and 13th May passed without noteworthy incident, except for an oral request from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs for permission to take away the forty-line private internal telephone exchange which the Telegraph Department had put into the embassy only a few days earlier. It was represented that this was urgently needed elsewhere, and I consented to its removal on condition that it should be replaced by another which would be adequate to ensure the maintenance of telephone communication inside the embassy premises. My condition was accepted and the exchange amicably carried out. 37. Late in the evening of the 13th May I received a note from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs stating that they had learnt that Iraqi prisoners of war were being kept at Habbaniya, and asking that, in accordance with international practice, they should be removed to places of safety. They added that if this were not done the Iraqi authorities would be obliged to act in a similar manner. I sent to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, for transmission to you, an en clan telegram summarising this note, and informed them that, as I was denied the right to send cypher telegrams, I could take no further action in the matter. The information contained in y our telep‘am No. 467 of the 20th May that Iraqi captives would be removed from the Koyai Air Force cantonment as soon as possible was communicated to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs on the 23rd May. 38. Between the 15th and 20th May the Ministry for Foreign Affairs were again active. On the 16th May they asked me to convey a protest to His Majesty’s Government against the bombing of a military hospital at Fallujah on the 3rd May, and the bombing of military ambulances on the 12th and 13th May. They gave warning that the continuance of such attacks would “absolve the Iraqi forces from all responsibility if they acted in a similar manner.' A second note protesting against the machine-gunning of a motor ambulance on the 13th May was delivered to me on the 19th May. The purport of these notes was sent to you in my telegrams Nos. 448 and 453. Air Headquarters, in commenting on these allegations, admitted that a stick of bombs aimed at another target had fallen into Fallujah. but denied that ambulances had ever intentionally been attacked. They pointed out, on the other hand, that Iraqi shells had hit three churches in Habbaniya, and had also fallen in the hospital grounds. Moreover, on the 16th May, six German aircraft had deliberately machine-gunned: two British ambulances clearly marked with the Red Cross. 39. The next day it seemed possible that the demand made earlier for the expulsion of Iraqi servants from the embassy precincts would be revived (see paragraph 28). The head of the Protocol Department telephoned in the morning to say that, in view of the Iraqi Government’s proclamation of the day before, the authorities desired all Iraqis remaining in the embassy to leave at once. He added an assurance that no harm would be done to them. I assumed that he was referring to a proclamation which had been referred to in the bulletins broadcast by the Bagdad Radio Station, warning all Iraqis in the service of the British Government that, unless they left their posts within seven days, they would be condemned to death and their property would be confiscated. I did not, however, know the full text of this proclamation, nor was it clear to nie that it was necessarily intended! to apply to Iraqi servants in the embassy. 40. I accordingly caused a semi-official reply to be sent to this message pointing out that it was contrary to accepted diplomatic practice that pressure of any kind should be brought to bear to compel the servants of a diplomatic mission to leave its service, and that, if the proclamation had been made requiring Iraqis to leave the service of a foreign Government, it could! not properly be applied to the employees of a diplomatic mission. The reply also asked that, if the Iraqi authorities decided to proceed further.with the matter. I should be furnished with the text of the proclamation to which reference had been made, and’ I gave warning that, if the demand for the expulsion of the embassv’s Iraqi servants were pressed. His Majesty’s Government would no doubt take similar action against all Iraqi diplomatic missions and consulates in territories under their control.9 41. The 18th May passed quietly, but on the 19th May, in addition to the second protest against the machine-gunning of a military ambulance on the road Fallujah—Bagdad which I have already mentioned, I received a note from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs stating (a) that on the 18th May a British aircraft had dropped pamphlets on Fallujah threatening the inhabitants that the town would be bombed owing to the location of Iraqi troops in that area, and (b) that, in the opinion of the Iraqi Government, the bombing of towns was a reprehensible act contrary to international treaties. The note ended with the warning that, if the British military authorities killed Iraqi civilians, reprisals must be expected against the British civilians in various cities in Iraq. Without in any way consulting His Majesty’s Government, on whom the final decision rested, I explained to the Ministry that, if there was strong presumption that Iraqi troops were located in Fallujah, it would be quite legitimate for British aeroplanes to bomb it and that the wilful bombing of, or other reprisals against, British civilians in their present situation in Iraq would be an outrage which would no doubt lead to the strongest counteraction by His Majesty’s Government. If, on the other hand, Fallujah were an open town, Iraqi troops would have to be withdrawn and a declaration to that effect made by the Iraqi Government. On the following day I learnt from the British Broadcasting Corporation that, before my reply was delivered to the Ministry, British forces had occupied Fallujah. 42. On the 21st May I received through the Ministry for Foreign Affairs your telegram No. 877. in which, with reference to the Iraqi note mentioned above, you instructedIne to inform the Iraqi authorities that His Majesty’s forces had so far scrupulously abstained from bombing any but military objectives in Irac^ and to warn them that, if any acts of violence were committed against British subjects, such crimes would meet with drastic retribution. In their comment, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs stated that they had already made it clear that the Iraqi authorities would regard the bombing by British aircraft of non-military targets and the consequent shedding of innocent blood as a violation of inter national law, and that in such circumstances reprisals could not be regarded as unjustifiable; responsibility for the result of such reprisals would, they main tained, devolve on the party which had provoked them. They also protested against the machine-gun attacks which, they alleged, British aircraft had made on peaceful civilians with fatal results. 43 . In acting on the instructions contained in your telegram, I drew particular attention to the unusual action of the Ministry in offering observations on a telegram addressed to the embassy before its contents had been communicated to me officially. 44 . On the same day, the Ministry protested against the bombing by British aircraft of quarters of Mosul inhabited by civilians and the resulting death of thirty-two persons and the wounding of twenty-six, of whom the majority were —On the 26th May the Ministry complained that fences, defence works and a new aerial mast had been set up in the embassy grounds. They declared that all such activities were contrary to international custom, and demanded that the erections should immediately be taken down and that an assurance should be given that they would not be put up again. In my reply, after recalling the fact that the immunities enjoyed by a diplomatic agent covered his residence, and that I therefore had unfettered right to make whatever structural alteration or additions I might think necessary to the embassy, I explained that the work on wire fencing facing and in the vicinity of the rivet had been staited by my predecessor to keep out cats and trespassers, that no aerials had been put up on the roof since the 3 rd May, when, in blatant contravention of international law, and in spite of the strongest protest, an official from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, accompanied by experts, had searched the embassy and satisfied himself that there no longer existed any aerials for wireless transmitter sets. Further, I was able to explain that what was regarded by the Iraqi authorities as a newly constructed strong point was only, in fact, a corrugated-iron shelter for shower- baths. The demand contained in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs’ note and the arguments adduced in support thereof were so fatuous that I can only presume that the Ministry for Foreign Affairs were once more acting as a post office for the complaints of the military authorities, who, as a matter of fact, had for some old men, women and children. This protest was repeated to you ir No. 456. ' „ [19—44] cunexplained reason taken over the protection of the embassy from the police foi twenty-four hours at about that time. . . 46. After this I received no more tiresome notes from the Ministry, and each day artillery fire and bomb explosions sounded nearer and B.B.C. broad casts announced the approach of our troops. We also learnt that pamphlets hau been dropped announcing that the Regent would soon return to the capital. 47. On the 30th May the Lord Mayor of Bagdad, Arshad Beg A1 Umari, telephoned to tell me that the Sharif Sharaf, Rashid Ali, his Cabinet and the four military commanders who had supported him, the ex-Mufti of Jerusalem and some thirty to forty other adherents of the short-lived rebel Government had fled the country, and that he. with the Director-General of Police, a senior army officer who had had nothing to do with Rashid Ali and his fi lends, and the Director-General of Irrigation, had set up a Committee of Internal Security to maintain order until the Regent could return and form a constitutional Govern ment. The Lord Mayor said that he wished to see me as soon as possible and suggested that I should attend a meeting of the heads of foreign diplomatic missions which, with a view to stopping the fighting, he had called at the municipal offices. I excused myself and asked the counsellor to attend instead. The latter pointed out that no progress could be made unless full telephone, telegraph and wireless facilities were immediately restored to His Majesty s Embassy. Instructions were at once given and the Royal Air force wireless transmitter was returned within half an hour. Apart from this, nothing occuired at the meeting which deserves record, and shortly after 4 o clock in the afternoon the counsellor brought Arshad Beg and the newly appointed Acting Chief of the General Staff, Lieutenant-Colonel Nuruddin Mahmud, to see me at the embassy. 48. They asked for an armistice to enable the Regent to return and set up a constitutional Government, and I accordingly communicated their request to the General Officer Commanding by wireless telegram. In the meantime, however, British air and ground forces could be heard attacking the Iraqi positions on the outskirts and, as darkness came, the Lord Mayor telephoned urgently to ask that arrangements might be made to send out an Iraqi party with a white flag to arrange an immediate local suspension of hostilities, until the appeal for a general armistice had been considered. 49. The General Officer Commanding the columns operating against Bagdad met the Iraqi flag of truce at 4 o’clock the following morning about 8 miles outside Bagdad, and then sent me a message asking me to go out to see him before the armistice terms were settled. I arrived at the rendezvous at about 6 o’clock in the morning and brought back with me the terms prepared by General Clark and Air Vice-Marshal D’Albiac for a general armistice throughout Iraq. These were drawn up in consultation with me and with my approval. On returning to Bagdad I handed them to the Lord Mayor and the Acting Chief of General Staff, who took them to the Ministry of Defence for discussion with the remaining senior officers of the Iraqi army and the Committee of Internal Security. In the after noon (31st May) Arshad Beg, together with General Ismail Namiq, Colonel Hamid Nasrat and Lieutenant-Colonel Nuruddin Mahmud, came to the embassy to discuss the terms. They wished at first to make some textual alterations with the intention of making the armistice appear to be the result of mutual agreement and not of terms offered by the victors to the vanquished. I explained, however, that I had no authority to amend the General Officer Commanding’s draft, and after some discussion, in which I was supported by Arshad-al-Umari, the officers signed the armistice terms at 3-30 p.m. A copy of the text of the armistice, together with a translation of a letter covering the question of the Basra area and Washash Camp in respect of Iraqi troops is enclosed herein. 50. The next morning ( 1 st June) the Regent reached Bagdad. He was accompanied, amongst others, by Jamil Madfai, Nuri Said and Ali Jaudat. I and my staff and the senior British officials in the service of the Iraqi Government went to meet his Highness some miles out in the desert on the Fallujah Road and returned with him to the palace, where he received the congratulations of members of the Diplomatic Corps and a large gathering of officials, notables and well- wishers. No representative of the Japanese Legation was present. 51. The Regent’s return marked the close of Rashid Ali’s attempt to over throw the Constitution and govern the country with the aid of an army Junta in alliance with the Axis Powers. It should not be assumed, however, that this392 X' •*y 11 | Ht L.OO event will bring to an end our political difficulties in this countrv 1 Germany will sit still after this set-back.

IN his despatch No. 114 of the 26th March, Sir B asil Newton reviewed events in Iraq up to the time of the return of Taufiq Suwaidi (then Minister for Foreign Affairs) from his visit to Cairo. In this despatch I shall record briefly the subsequent events which concluded with the arrival of British troops at Basra. 2 . So soon as he came back to Bagdad Taufiq Suwaidi began to go into the question of breaking off relations with Italy. He quickly found that the senior military commanders were resolutely opposed to such a step and realised that in order to have freedom of action the Cabinet must remove these officers from the dominant position which they had secured in the political life of the country. He therefore took up this matter with the Prime Minister and his colleagues as a necessary preliminary to dealing with the Italian Legation. At the same time the Regent continued to be insistent that the Prime Minister should take disciplinary action against the same officers for their misbehaviour during the crisis which had taken place at the end of January. 3. After much hesitation Taha Pasha was induced to act. Towards the end of March he issued an order as Minister of Defence transferring Lieutenant- Colonel Kamil Shabib, Officer Commanding 1 st Division with headquarters in Bagdad, to command the 4th Division stationed at Diwaniyah. Kamil Shabib refused to obey and supported by his three associates, Lieutenant-Colonel Salah- ud-Din Sabbagh, Officer Commanding 3rd Division, Lieutenant-Colonel Fahmi Said, Officer Commanding Mechanised Force, and Lieutenant-Colonel Mahmud Salman, Officer Commanding Iraqi Air Force, he called on Taha Pasha and declared the order to be illegal. Taha Pasha was quite unable to deal effectively with this insubordination. He gave up the attempt to assert the authority of the Cabinet and to appease the Regent offered his Highness the suggestion that he should receive the four officers, accept an apology from them and thereafter regard the affair of their earlier misconduct as closed.' The Amir would not at first agree to this proposal, but finding no support or encouragement from the politicians of any party or group for his desire to deal firmly with military presumption he yielded afterwards to the Prime Minister’s importunities and' on the 1 st April signified his willingness to receive the officers at the Palace. 4. His decision came too late. A few hours afterwards, between 10 o’clock and midnight, troops occupied the Bagdad telegraph office, the telephone exchange and the broadcasting station and picketed all the approaches to the city. The four officers then extorted a letter of resignation from Taha Pasha and went to find the Regent to demand that he should accept Taha Pasha’s resignation and appomt Rashid Ali in his place. The Regent, being warned, eluded them, and after hiding m a relative’s house throughout the night took refuge earlv the next morning in the American Legation. 5- The Regent s flight placed the officers in a dilemma, for without an 1 rad ah from his Highness neither Taha Pasha’s resignation nor Rashid Ali’s appointment could be made constitutionally complete. From the empty Palace they returned to Taha Pasha’s house where the members of the Cabinet had by then been gathered together. The meeting seems to have gone on all through the mgnt while the Cabinet made a vain attempt to find a compromise. In the morning they dispersed with nothing settled and twenty-four hours of uncertaintv followed, during which Taufiq Suwaidi made a last despairing effort to persuade I aha Pasha to hold the Government together and defy the officers. But Taha I asha had no courage for such a task, and by the evening it was known that he had thrown m his hand. The following day ( 3 rd April) his resignation [19 s] • * ; ' //«J e&lt; ^&lt;-0&gt; -tv, IrEOd.POU.DEPt. T 1 12JUL &gt;9412 was published in the press and Rashid Ali took over control of the Government offices in the name of the Government of National Defence. 6 . The Regent, in the meantime, was spirited away from the American Legation to Habbaniya, where I found him on the afternoon of the 2 nd April on my arrival by air from Cairo. I had only time for a brief conversation before I proceeded to Bagdad, but I did what I could to encourage him. The next afternoon he and Ali Jaudat Beg were flown to Basra. He was joined two days later by Jamil Madfai. 7. The first act of the Government of National Defence was to issue two proclamations. The first appeared over the signature of the Chief of the General Staff, Amin Zaki. It accused the Regent of treason, violation of the rights of the nation and desertion of his post in time of crisis. It then went on to declare that the army had provisionally entrusted full executive authority to Rashid Ali- al-Gailani as head of a Government of National Defence. The second proclama tion was signed by Rashid Ali. He declared that he had accepted the burden of the position of head of the National Government as a patriotic duty, and added that the programme of the Government would be to carry on Iraq’s national mission, to honour Iraq’s international obligations, especially the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty, and to keep Iraq out of the war. 8 . In Basra the garrison was at first friendly to the Amir Abdul Illah, but later, on receipt of orders from Bagdad, the officer commanding attempted on the 4th April to arrest his Highness and his companions. They fortunately escaped and took refuge on board one of His Majesty’s ships in the Shatt-al-Arab. The officer commanding then arrested the mutessarif, who had been loyally helping his Highness, and sent him in custody to Bagdad. These events destroyed the Regent’s hope of establishing a strong centre of loyalty at Basra from which he could defy the junta in Bagdad, and apart from 'giving him asylum there remained little that His Majesty’s Government could do to help his cause. 9. In Bagdad Rashid Ali pushed forward rapidly measures to regularise his Administration. He formed a High Defence Council consisting of the Chief of the General Staff, the officers commanding the four divisions of the Iraqi army, the officer commanding the mechanised force and the officer commanding the Iraqi air force. The civil members were himself, Yunis Sabawi and Ali Mahmud (the last two had been his supporters in the crisis which led to his fall in January). He also got into touch with the embassy through the adviser to the Ministry of the Interior. Through this channel he conveyed profuse assurances of his desire to carry out loyally the treaty of alliance, and indicated that in order to obtain the full recognition of His Majesty’s Government he was willing to put through the following plan : the Regent to accept Taha Pasha’s resignation and to entrust Rashid Ali with the task of forming a new Cabinet. The new Cabinet then to sanction the Regent’s absence from the country for four months and the Sharif Sharaf to act as Regent while the Amir Abdul Illah was away. He undertook concurrently personally to broadcast to counter German propaganda, to implement the alliance on a wider basis than before, to stop all agitation about Palestine and Syria, to give control of publicity to the adviser to the Ministry of the Interior and to prepare public opinion for a rupture with Italy. His military associates would not, however, give time for a reply to be received to these proposals, and under their pressure he summoned an extraordinary meeting of Parliament on the 10 th April. A joint session of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies then gave a unanimous vote in favour of setting aside the Amir Abdul Illah and electing the Sharif Sharaf Regent in his place. Forceful methods were used to persuade Senators and Deputies to attend and to vote in the desired manner Some absented themselves, but 94 out of a total of 135 were present 10 . In a speech made after the election of the new Regent Rashid Ali said :— “ This national movement is entirely an internal movement having- no connexion whatever with any foreign State. Our relations with foreign States are based on the honouring of our international obligations in accordance with our custom. I declare also that we shall honour the Anglo Iraqi Treaty. We shall carry out and maintain this alliance and Irna will continue zealously to fulfil this treaty, both in the letter and the spirit ” 11 . Immediately after his election the new Regent went to the Palace where his first official act was to accept the resignation of Taha-al-Hashimi and his3 second to entrust the formation of a new Cabinet to Rashid Ali. Rashid Ali completed this task two days later and on the 12th April the new Regent signed Iradahs making the following appointments :— Prime Minister and Acting Minister of the Interior : Rashid Ali. Foreign Affairs : Musa Shahandar. Defence : Naji Shawkat. Finance : Naji Suwaidi. Justice : Ali Mahmud. Social Affairs : Rauf Bahrani. Economics : Yunis Sabawi. Education : Hassan Salman. Communications and Works : Muhammad Ali Mahmud. Behind the Cabinet the High Defence Council remained in being and placed the military commanders in a position from which they could virtually veto anv Cabinet proposal which they disliked. 12. On the 13th April I received your decision that sea- and air-borne troops would be sent urgently to Basra to open up a line of communication through Iraq to Palestine. I thereupon arranged with the air officer commanding and the senior naval officer in the Persian Gulf for the Amir Abdul Illah and his party to be taken from Basra to safety in Jerusalem. They arrived at their destination on the 16th April. Meanwhile I made private and unofficial contact with Rashid Ah m the hope of leading him into a proper mood to accept the arrival of British troops without opposition. Information of their coming seems to have reached the Iraqi Government from several different sources two or three days before the troops were due, and the Ministry of Defence sent reinforcements to Basra with orders to resist any unauthorised landing. I therefore decided to give formal notification of the approach of the convoy some hours earlier than I had originally intended, in oidei to allay misgivings and to forestall direct enquiry. I m et Rashid Ali for the third time on the evening of the 16th April. ex plam e d that the troops were coming to open the lines of communication, and that it the new Government gave unconditional co-operation in accordance with the provisions of the treaty His Majesty’s Government, for their part, would be prepared to enter at once into formal relations. I also expressed the hope that further co-operation on the part of the Iraqi authorities would enable formal relations to be established before long. Rashid Ali received this news well, and agreed to give all facilities for the movement of troops under the plans drawn up last summer. r 14. The air-borne troops began to arrive on the afternoon of the 17th April and the movement nontirm^d r ri.„ n , (a) All measures should be taken to fmsten i ™ ™ ^ i „ i {C) ino lurther troops should disembark i i . • i * b W xx — mclvvccij incniseives ana ms Majesty's Government, [19-8] B 216. Public feeling about the arrival of the troops has been vanet . n ^ forceful persuasion from the local authorities deputations from a 1 pai s o n provinces have been flocking into Bagdad to offer fulsome congra u a ions o e new Prime Minister, but their private sentiments are different, in mos n\&lt;is, except Diwaniya and Kerbala, the tribal attitude is generally one o im i f !ei , Uv ‘ The tribes feel that their personal and tribal interests are not involved and they regard the latest change as being much the same as the other changes o jovem ment which have been brought about almost annually since the mandate came to an end. Some of the older men of the official and educated classes are a ii c shocked by the way in which the Constitution has been disregarded and the law set aside, but others are disposed to see in it an opportunity for promotion. Most of the vounger educated men were at first enthusiastic supporters of Kashi&lt;. . i &gt; new regime, which they believed would bring the final delivery of Iraq from the trammels of British control, but when British troops arrived Rashid Ah lost much of his popularity. It seemed to many that he had deceived them anc la . while posing as the champion of fuller national liberties, he had secretly come to terms with the British. They even accused him openly of having been bribed by His Majesty’s Government. In the Diwaniyah and Kerbala liwas tribal opinion is sharply divded. Rashid Ali has secured the support of some oi the leading sheikhs by flattery and promises, but there are many others who are against him, and it is in the Diwaniyah liwa that trouble for the Government is most likely to begin. The Shiah Divines of the Holy Cities have so far refused to declare in favour of the new regime. , . 17. The attitude of foreign Governments towards the new regime has varied with their relations with His Majesty’s Government. The American. Turkish and E°yptiaii Governments instructed their representatives to act in harmony with the British Embassy. King Ibn Saud recognised the new arrangement's, but sent advice to Rashid Ali to take care of his relations with His Majesty s Government. The Italian and Japanese Governments were, of course, quick to offer generous congratulations, but the representative of the Vichy Government though not keeping in such close touch with the embassy as his American, Turkish and Egyptian colleagues, was instructed not to enter into relations with the new Government before I had received your instructions to do so myself. 18. The army commanders’ prompt seizure of the administrative machine and their effective secret police work prevented any of the Iraqi politicians outside Rashid Ali’s group from opposing his plans. As I have related above, Jamil Madfai and Ali Jaudat succeeded in joining the Regent, but they were at once driven to take refuge on a British warship and, after that, were quite unable to influence the march of events. Muhammad-al-Sadr, the President of the Senate, and Maulud Mukhlis, the President of the Chamber, both stood aloof, but, though disgusted with the proceedings of Rashid Ah and his army friends, they were afraid to move against them. Taufiq Suwaidi, Umar Nazim, Ali Mumtaz, Abdul Mahdi and Sadiq Bassam, all members of Taha Pasha's last Cabinet, were at the outset full of fire against Rashid Ali and wanted to rally round the Regent. They soon lost heart, however, when they saw that none of the tribes were rising in defence of his Highness, and they then quietly effaced themselves in their homes. Nuri Pasha fled to Amman at the first sign of the coming of the storm and was joined there by Daud-al-Haidari. In contrast to the comprehensive and efficient measures taken by Rashid Ali and the militai \ commanders, the preparations made by the Regent to meet the situation were pitiable. Although the dangers of a coup d’ft tat must have been obvious for weeks before it took place, he and his advisers appear to have been taken completely by surprise. They seem to have assumed that the majority of the army and of the tribes was loyal and that it was therefore unnecessary to take any special precautions. They did not even make plans to leave Bagdad quietly and meet at some prearranged rallying-point should a sudden crisis render this course necessary. In consequence, although they were commonly supposed to have the major portion of the country behind them, they were defeated in an incredibly short time. They are now discouraged and unorganised, and it seems evident that the growth of any effective opposition to the present regime will be slow The Regent is well liked, but his personality is not one to arouse the enthusiasm of the people. There are none in Iraq who would risk their lives to bring about his return. Of his followers, Jamil Madfai is probably the best, but taken on the Whole, they do not compare in vigour and resourcefulness with5 their opponents. They represent the more solid and slow-moving elements as contrasted with the youthful and hery. No group of Iraqis has as yet held together for long and it may well be that the inevitable disintegration of the present regime will come about more from its own actions and its internal dissensions than from the strength of its opponents. At present it has-&gt;established a firm control over the whole country and effective opposition is non-existent. 19.

CONFIDENT! (No. 235.) HIS Majesty’s Ambassador presents his compliments to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and has the honour to transmit herewith a copy of a record of conversation between the Secretary of State and the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 7th March, 1941, and a memorandum by Mr. Holman, dated the 8 th March, 1941. Cairo, March 17 ,1941. AFTER lunch to-day at the Embassy I had an hour’s conversation with the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs on the general situation and in particular on Anglo-Iraqi relations. General Situation. 1 . 1 explained to the Minister for Foreign Affairs that I had come out here with General Sir John Dill to review the situation in the light of British successes in Africa. He would realise that victories in Libya had transformed the military situation in the Middle East. The spring and summer would be hard, as Germany had to secure a decision somehow before British, Dominion and American industries reached the peak of their production next year, and it was only by breaking Great Britain that Germany could hope to win. We had secured air supremacy over Great Britain and the Channel and unless Germany could obtain air day supremacy, she could not beat us. As it was she was distributing her air forces over Tripoli, Sicily and elsewhere so that the chances of her reach ing her objective must have considerably diminished. Turkey and Greece. 2. I told the Minister for Foreign Affairs that I had just paid a visit to Turkey and Greece to get first-hand information of the position for the purposes of close collaboration, particularly in view of the German menace in the Balkans. I said that Turkey would certainly fight if she were attacked and that I was deeply impressed by the spirit of friendship for Great Britain throughout the country. Greece too was fighting bravely and was proud of her achievements. Great Britain would send both Turkey and Greece all assistance in her power if either of them were attacked by Germany. There were already a large number of British aircraft on the Greek front, but it was not the policy of His Majesty’s Government to give a pretext of provocation to Germany. If ever Germany took the initiative His Majesty’s Government must have everything in readiness to counter such a move. In reply to a question by the Minister for Foreign Affairs I said that it was for the Turkish Government to say for certain whether Turkey would immediately come to the help of Greece, if the latter were attacked by Germany. She probably would, but that was a military and political consideration which would naturally depend for its application on the opportune moment. I was convinced, however, that the spirit of Turkey was completely on the side of Greece. I told his Excellency that reports that I was arranging with the de Gaullists,or had done a deal with Turkey at the expense of Syria, to invade Syria were on a line with the usual German propaganda. I added that, if Turkey were Enclosure 1 . Record of Conversation between the Secretary of State and the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs on March 7, 1941. [16—47] ) FA Y 942 yioio attacked by Germany, Turkey would have many military advantages to balance the striking power of the German war machine. 3. I concluded by assuring the Minister for Foreign Affairs that Iraq was never mentioned in my talks in Turkey, so that rumours of the conclusion of a secret agreement between Turkey and Great Britain at the expense of Iraq were^ without any foundation. Anglo-Iraqi Relations. 4. I emphasised that x\nglo-Iraqi relations were far from satisfactory to-day. Iraq was an ally and yet the Italian Legation still existed in Bagdad. The Iraqi Government were not carrying out their obligations under article 4 of the treaty in the letter and spirit and were not behaving like loyal allies such as Greece, Turkey and Egypt. It was quite impossible for me to ask His Majesty’s Government to provide dollars and other Iraqi requirements so long as the Iraqi Government harboured this Italian centre of intrigue. Iraqi relations could never be put on a proper basis so long as His Majesty’s Government were not given satisfaction on this point. In fact His Majesty’s Government might even find themselves, in view of war-time conditions, obliged to cut down what they were already doing for Iraq and concentrate on 100 per cent, allies. 5. His Excellency replied that he himself was convinced of the wisdom of close co-operation with Great Britain, but that the rupture of diplomatic rela tions with Italy was a most delicate question and needed careful preparation. He explained that since the rupture of relations with Germany the Iraqi army had been constantly kept short of war equipment. &amp;c., by Great Britain; this had created a deplorable effect on the army. It had therefore become more difficult now in view of army feeling to break with Italy at our request. If he could only be given time he would try and win over the army to his point of view. Failing that he would try to eliminate the army leaders. If he did not succeed, he himself would resign. What help could Great Britain give if the army opposed by force the action of the Government? I replied that this was quite a new aspect which would require consideration. It was the duty of Iraqi Government to govern in its own territories and to fulfil its treaty obligations. 6 . I expressed my thanks to his Excellency for his personal intervention in securing the appointment of Mr. Smith as Director-General of Railways. His Excellency seemed very flattered and said that he had met Mr. Smith that morning and liked him. At my request he promised to let the Embassy have an official acceptance of the nomination on his return to Bagdad. 7. The Minister for Foreign Affairs stated that he had suggested recently a plan for the return of Palestinian refugees to Palestine; but had so far received no answer. I replied that the matter was under examination by the competent authorities ( see Bagdad telegrams Nos. 132 and 177). His Excellencv enouired whether His Majesty s Uovernment could not implement immediately the under taking in the White Paper of Palestine regarding the establishment of a Constitu tion. I told him that naturally His Majesty’s Government stood by the White Paper but that I could not go beyond that. 8. His Excellency then raised the question of direct railway communication between Turkey and Iraq. He was agreeable in principle but would need rmiterial and a loan to carry through the project (see Bagd ad telegrams No ft tn of State at Athens and No. 192 to Foreign Office)! He estimated the cost at ' £6 million, wny could we not use the line through Syria or lorry traffic by road v In reply to his request I told the Minister for Foreign Affairs that concrete proposals for the scheme would be submitted to him. 9. In conclusion the Minister for Foreign Affairs asked why no satisfaction had been given to the Iraqi Government in connexion with their proposals of 193R for the application of the Iraqi Customs to Koweit and the construction of railway line from Basra to Khor Abdullah. I promised to look ino, fi™ questions. 10. After the Minister for Foreign Affairs’ departure I instructed Mr bis F.xcellency that I reeard ahnnt a , . ‘ ’ Holman to make it clear to his „ regard ahout a fortnight a« *1 proper period m which the Minister for Foreign Affairs might prepare the ground tor the rupture of relations with Italy. This would enable me to put off con si d ing the proposals contained in Bagdad telegram No. 191 until mv siaer - London in the event of no satisfaction being 1 Wthf’cming. return to3 Enclosure 2 . Memorandum by Mr. Holman. THE Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs asked me to cal] on him this morning when he went over all the points in your conversation of yesterday. He seemed very pleased at the cordiality of the interview. 2 . The main question discussed was of course the rupture of diplomatic relations with Italy. I therefore took the opportunity of telling him that you hoped that in about a fortnight we should see his efforts crowned with success. He replied that he would do everything he could. He then expressed the view that his task with colleagues would be made easier if he could have some personal assurance that in the event of the dismissal of the Italian Legation— ( 1 ) His Majesty’s Government would he accommodating as regards dollars and equipment; ( 2 ) His Majesty’s Government would implement their undertaking in the White Paper to proceed to the establishment of a Constitution in Palestine; and (3) That His Majesty’s Government would now or later sponsor “ Syria for the Syrians.” 3. I told him that there could be no question of marchandage. but personally I felt that as regards ( 1 ) His Majesty’s Government would do what they could. Everything depended on the amount of dollars and equipment available. As regards (2) I referred him to your statement yesterday that His Majesty’s Government stood by the White Paper, but that it was difficult to go too fast' in war time. The Minister for Foreign Affairs appeared satisfied. As regards ( 3 ) the Minister for Foreign Affairs said that the Iraqi Government would be only too pleased for Great Britain to occupy Syria. What they wished to avoid was that the future of Syria should be decided by de-Gaullists, Vichy-ites and Turks. If the British held the country, they could give it its independence after the war in consultation with the Iraqi Government. I pointed out to his Excellency all the difficulties of making any official declaration about the future of Svria at this moment, and that it was difficult for us to tie our hands as regards the future. His Excellency will mention these points to you at the E^mbassy reception this afternoon if you can spare him five minutes. He proposed to leave for Bagdad by British Airways on Wednesday next. 4.

My telegram No. 1527, May I receive guidance as soon as possible as to the reactions of His Majesty’s Government to the landing of German aircraft in Syria? May I also be informed what line it is desired that our propaganda should take m the matter? 2. It seems clearly right that General Gatroux should proceed at once to Jerusalem and do his best to enlighten opinion in Syria as to what is happening. Further decisions may have to be taken rapidly. On general grounds it seems to me unthinkable that we should not exploit every possibility of offering resistance by whatever means to a German occupation of Syria. 3. The situation is being fully discussed with the Service Commanders, General Gatroux and General Spears. //////////5i I have been informed by a source in touch with French- military circles that one of the main French pre occupations in connexion with possible German descent is whether, in fact, we should be in a position to intervene effectively as General Fougere has convinced Dentz that we have hardly any troops in Palestine. Any reassurance onthis point v{hich you can authorize me to pass to the High Commissioner might, I consider, have favourable influence on him. 6. I assume from the second paragraph of your telegram 110 that His Majesty’s Government do not intend in any case to forestall German attack by attempting preventive occupation. Such an attempt would undoubtedly be resisted. On the other hand, it would, in my opini n, be essential to intervene, if at all, within 48 hours of German Army s descent; in ohat case, the French in my opinion, would not resist, and might even be glad to see us.nytt, \ . .OUTWARD TELEGRAM &lt;Jl4* UauM [This Document is the Property/of Hi//Britannic Majesty’s Government, and should be FROM FOREIGN OFFICE TO BEIRUT .

In view of the imiortance of safe-guarding the railway communications it would seem logical that the Turkish Government should occupy Aleppo and hold the railway in the event of German attack being followed by British military action from the south. This was contemplated at the earlier staff conversations. I am, however, uncertain how you view this problem in the present circumstances.* AMENDED COPY .* j' [CYPHER] DEPARTMENTAL (SECRET ) ' FROM BEIRUT TO FOREIGN OFFICE . Mr# Havard.

High Commissioner, to whom I spoke in this sense on May 2nd, reaffirmed determination to carry out hi^present orders to resist but considered the German descent unlikely at least until they had secured their lines of communication by infiltration of Turkey. He had, however, informed Vichy of the possible developments (see my telegram No. 110#) Suggestion of British co-operation in case of need obviously interested him, but he maintained that his-resources were adequate to deal with any German attack on the scale suggested in your telegram No. *107*. 2. I cannot discover that an y spec ial preparations have been made in *the country* either for or against the arrival of air-borne troops. Reports which have reached the Middle East Intelligence Centre of concentrations of lorries near aero dromes etc., appear to be unfounded. No Germans, apart from residents, are here (though some are said to be arriving on May 9th) and the Italian Commission is shov/ing little activity. 3. Stores of aviation spirit in this country are estimated at less than 1,000 tons stored mostly at Rayak and Aleppo. The French military stocks of ordinary petrol are thought not to exceed 1,000 tons stored at various depots. Civil stocks of petrol are low. 4. While the Germans may, in any case, be able by a determined effort to seize some aerodromes (Rayak and Aleppo being the most likely in view of the stocks of petrol there), I am inclined to agree with the High Commissioner that it would be unlikely, unless of course they had first succeeded in inducing Vichy to order the High Commisioner not to resist.

They urge that these developments mast surely arise from some mi sunder standing exploited by' Axis agents, and appeal to Rashid to settle peacefully with British in wider interests of Moslem freedom. It is incomprehensible to Indian opinion that Indian troops should In any way be regarded as menacing Iraq independence, or freedom of action of an Iraqi Government, since It was largely due to Indian troops that Iraq independence was achieved. Indian troops, when they landed at Basra, wore pleased, but not surprised, at the people ? s welcome. They felt they were coming to a country their fathers had helped to establish, and with which since the last war close (? relations) of trade and alliance had been established. The people of Basra were spontaneously friendly, but have now been forced by Iraq military action of most repressive nature to suspend any relations with the men they received so war ally. The cause of this charge is fully realised by the Indian forces now in Iraq who have deliberately avoided any action against interests of the people. Military action has been strictly confined to self-defence against Iraqi forces directed by Baghdad 'Government” in defiance of treaty. In Basra, fore example, steps were successfully taken by our troops to secure establishments essential to their security and to prevent the Iraq forces from getting such a grip on essential services as to render the people helpless in power of their irresponsible army leaders. No further action has been taken in the Basra area than, this intercourse required after Iraq military had failed to fulfil a promise to withdraw from specified points. Such violent action as has been necessary is purely for the self-defence of Habbanxyah Air Force station where safe harbourage allowed to British women and children from Baghdad by Iraqi Govt, was promptly violated by Iraqi air and land forces. For the protection of (? party) from these attacks it has been necessary to (? attack) Iraqi military and air installations in the area from which the assault has been organised.

I HE chief political event which has occurred sin ce I wrote my despatch No. 89 of the 1st March was the meeting of the Minister for Foreign Affairs with yourself in Cairo at the end of the first week in March. Taufiq Suwaidi returned to Bagdad on the 17th March. He spoke to me and to others of his difficulties and regretted that His Majesty’s Government had not found a means to help him to overcome them by promising munitions for the army. He was, however, prepared to tackle, albeit with some uneasiness, the task set him of severing diplomatic relations with Italy. 2. He was not precise in his talk about his difficulties, but it is safe to put them down as being the determined opposition of Rashid Ali, the Mufti and the military clique, and the half-heartedness or worse of General Taha. Of these elements the Mufti holds the central position, and quite apart from the strength which he gains from his alliance with the other two, the Mufti ’s personal influence with General Taha, and even with Taufiq Suwaidi, makes it difficult for either to affront him by doing anything so contrary to his wishes as to break off relations with Italy. There have been some signs, however, that the Mufti, or at any rate his Palestinian associates, are not as popular as they were, and in responsible quarters as far apart as Sulaimaniya and Bagdad I have heard criticism of their continued presence and of the cost involved to Iraq. 3. The Cabinet are, however, confronted with other perplexing problems. The military clique is still defiant, the vacancies in the Cabinet are not yet filled, and under the guidance of the Mufti and his associates tiresome agitations are developing in favour of interference in Syria’s troubles and the release of the men sentenced by court-martial in Bagdad and Mosul in 1939, including Hikmat Sulaiman and the men condemned for the murder of Mr. Monck Mason. 4. The press has also tried to make a major question of the recent disturb ances in Syria, and has been painting a picture of a formidable outbreak of national indignation with French misrule. Shukri Kawatli’s manifesto has been reproduced, and articles advocating that Iraq should support Syria in her struggle for freedom have appeared in most of the daily newspapers. When I saw the Minister for Foreign Affairs last week he did not, however, seem to have much sympathy with or knowledge of this agitation. 5. The story broadcast from Bari to the effect that the Syrian disturbances were the result of British intrigues was not taken up in the press here, though it still has wide currency among the people and has done much to confuse their ideas. It is hard for them to know what they should rightly think when, on the one hand, they are urged to believe that the Syrians are making a gallant bid for freedom and, on the other, they are assured that the whole movement has been arranged by the British for their own evil purposes. 6. In Parliament little of importance has occurred since the beginning of March. A Royal irada prolonged the current session until the end of the month, but the adjournment is likely to come without any further effort being made by either House to press home the criticisms and proposals put forward in the debates on the Government’s programme. 7. A new and successful feature of German wireless propaganda in Arabic which is having noticeable success in Bagdad is criticism of British democracy as bogus coupled with specious claims that national socialism levels the rich with the poor and ensures well-paid work for all. This theme appeals to a mass of men and women little interested in either Germany’s might or Hitler’s sympathy for Arab nationalism, and talk of the blessings that nazism would bring to the poor at the expense of the rich is now common in the Bagdad coffee-shops frequented [it 8] T »3 S 97by working men. As, however, it is the richer and not the poorer members of the community who have the chief influence, such propaganda may easily overreach itself. 8. The great Arabian pilgrimage fell this year on the 19th March. A vast concourse of thousands of Shias gathered in Kerbala, and it is to the credit of the authorities that no disorders or epidemics occurred. From several sources I learn that in poems and speeches and in the meeting-places of the people there was much said of loyalty to the Throne and the Regent, and the leading Ulema (“ Divines ”) seem to have warned the sheikhs and tribesmen quite frankly not to be deceived by anti-British propaganda. 9. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s representatives at Cairo, Angora, Jedda, Tehran, to His Majesty’s High Commissioner for Palestine and Transjordan and to the Government of India.

Also that it was illogical for His Maiesty’s Government to approach a Government which they refused to recognise, with such requests as that for permission to land troops.

MOST MiEDIATEc General Officer Commanding Basra 1 s telegram C/46/9 (repeated to Air Ministry). My views are as follows: 1. If Iraqis take hostile action against Habbaniya and are successful, I agree that General Officer Commanding Basra should treat local troops as hostile and assume control of civil administration. But he should await result of action at Habbaniya before taking action. (2) If hostile action against Habbaniya is taken and the Iraqi army is routed, it seems probable that present gang will flee. I would hope that the country would breathe a sigh of relief and that we would bo able to restore the Regent and instal a friendly Government. In such a case Iraqi army at Basra would in all probability also turn its coat, and I should be apposed to action against it or assuming control of administration on account of very bad effect it would have throughout the country. (5) If we decide to attack Iraqi army at Habbaniya and rout them my opinion is as in (2) above. 2. My^views as given above are based (l) on fact that we are fighting a particular pro-German gang and not the whole Iraqi army or nation. We want to confine ourselves to them if possible; (2) on fact that Iraqi army at Basra is weak and scattered and not a serious menace to our troops. I realise, however,, that, the General Officer Commanding must be the judge of local situation and that if local army or population show themselves hostile he may have to take action. I hope, however, that my general principles will be accepted.INDIA OUTWARD TELEGRAM This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and should be ) ^ direct T v yv kept under Lock and Key.] [Cypher] DEPARTI'.? dt 2Z26 ttNTAL (SECRET). 1 FROM FOREIGN OFFICE Ti No, 358 1st May, 19E1 d, 3.20 a.rn. 1st May, 19E1 Repeated to General Officer Commanding Basra No. 18 Air Officer Commanding Iraq Unnumbered Government of India No. 1783 Senior Naval Officer Persian Gulf No. 1 Commander-in-Chief Middle East No. 6 Air Officer Commanding--in--Chief Middle East Unnumbered Commander-in-Chief Mediterranean No. 32 Angora No. 961 Jerusalem No. 671 a.a.a. a.a. a.a MOST IMMEDIATE. 2324..

JJJJJJJJJJJ IVly telegram No. 406, T . I sav/ Rashid Ali and Minister for Foreign Affairs this afternoon for three hours. -They said that the arrival of the three shins had been considered by the Cabinet and High Defence Council who had resolved to adhere to their previous stipulations (see my telegram.No. 570). They had further resolved that no further discussions concerning the treaty or any other important matters.could be entered into with His. Majesty’s Government until I had presented my credentials. 2. I spoke in the sense - of my telegram No. 370 and long arguments about the provisions or tne.treaty followed. . 3. Rashid Ali r s main point was that however widely article 4. was .interpreted it could not possibly be held to give His Majesty’s Government the right to maintain (even in war time) any forces other than those provided' for in article 5. He was willing to give every possible facility for troops to pass through and to provide protection with Iraqi troops whenever |requested but the maintenance of a force at Basra was contrary to the treaty and would never be tolerated by the people of Iraq. 4. The army and people were already disturbed by the fact that no transport arrangement had yet been made to move any of the troops who had already arrived and it was quite impossible for the Government to consent to further troop disembarcations un less they could point to a corresponding exodus. 5. I entirely denied their interpretation of the treaty and insisted that we were acting fully within our rights. I said that the three ships contained anclllaries.which wene part of the force already here and were not new formations and that it was absurd to think that His Majesty’s Government in bringing troops had designs on the independence of the country or that a Brigade group constituted occupation. Troops had come to open a line of communication and sufficient forces were necessary at the base and at other points along the line. 6. I urged them to give orders for these three ships to be properly received. They would not however agree to do so even unde/ protest though I warned them that the ships would come nevertheless and that the consequences of any opposition or , obstruction/2, i obstruction would be serious. As regards public opinion, _ said that they knew quite well that this was manufactured by the Government and that if the Government gave the right lead, there would be no trouble at all. 7. They said they had already been exposed to violent criticism and that if the ships came in before a move along the lines of communication began, they would have to declare „ publicly that [grp. undec.] of a British force at Basra was a violation of the treaty for which they were^not responsible. No appeal to reason could move them from their attitude. Before I left I urged them once more to reflect before it was too late and warned them that my Government would hold the de facto Government responsible for any breach of the treaty and for any harm that might come to the foreign population if they stirred up public excitement. This development may be bluff on their part^ (though they did not give me that impression). Chiefly it may mean that they have received definite promise consisting of Axis support now or in the near future. In which case I assume that His Majesty's Government will proceed with their plan ‘ since the fundamental question of maintaining a base at Basra is involved and we should have to face the issue sooner or later. I am getting into immediate touch with Air Officer Commanding British Forces Iraq regarding prepautionary measures m Bagdad and keep in close touch with the General Officer Commanding. Their'attitude was so unsatisfactory that I am proceeding on the basis that they mean to make trouble, though as Basra is so strongly held it is more likely | to occur here. There were unmistakable hints that the treaty might be repudiated.PeJL TWARD TELEGRAM •^i ^.c.O^ i This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and should be * f .\ n kept under Lock and Key.] *IH- [Cypher].

Newton to Mr. Eden.—(Received April 8.) (No. 101.) Sir, Bagdad, March 8, 1941. WITH reference to my despatch No. 91 of th e 6th March informing you of the debate which took place m the (Jhamber on the programme of the new Govern ment, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a summary of the principal speeches delivered in the Senate during a debate on the same subject which took place on the 27th February. To simplify reading I have underlined( ! ) the chief points made by the speakers. 2. The speeches in the Senate were more definite and forceful than those delivered in the Chamber, and brought out more clearly many of the points which have been emphasised in private conversations by this embassy. Sharp attacks were made on the policy of the late Government, and the present Government were strongly criticised for failing to take proper steps to correct the errors of their predecessors. Jamil Madfai boldly declared that Iraq’s national existence depended on her alliance with Great Britain, and turned the tables on those who had made insinuations of British interference by saying that on the contrary the interference and propaganda had come from the Axis and should be stopped. Jalal Baban exposed Rashid Ali’s tergiversations, made a bold attack on the military clique and condemned the part played by teachers in encouraging the demonstrations planned as a protest against Rashid Ali’s “ forced ” resignation. Nuri Said denounced the heresy of thinking that Iraq was a neutral in the present war. 3. Not a speaker supported Rashid Ali, his foreign policy or his attempt to browbeat the Regent; in the frankness with which they spoke their minds the Senators showed a moral courage which has seldom been equalled in the short history of this country. Nuri Said’s championship of the policy of friendship with Britain and his call for guidance to public opinion, Ridha Shabib’s bold demand for a definition of the “ Iraq’s national mission ”—the latest pan-Arab cliche devised by Rashid Ali and forced by him on his successor—and Muhsin-al-Shilash’s frank avowal that the British Government had given Iraq real freedom after her admission into the League of Nations, and that Iraq herself was therefore alone to blame for all her adversities, were all utterances which showed a determination to face the truth in a manner which has hitherto been noticeably rare in public life here. 4. Naji Suwaidi’s speech requires explanation. His remarks about “ the sudden declarations ” made to the Iraqi Government refer presumably to the action which I took on the 25th November, 1940, when I informed the Regent and the Minister for Foreign Affairs that the elimination of Rashid Ali from the Government was essential if a serious crisis with His Majesty’s Government was to be avoided, and acquainted them with the dissatisfaction with which His Majesty’s Government had learned of the resumption of public telegraphic communication between Iraq and Germany. It had always been known that Naji Suwaidi was one of the Iraqi politicians who resented this action, and in his speech in the Chamber he maintained that it provided justification for Rashid Ali’s allegation that his resignation had been caused by foreign interference. The Prime Minister himself took up this particular point, and it is satisfactory to see that he vindicated the action of His Majesty’s Government in warning the Iraqi Government of “ certain matters which might adversely affect the interests of the alliance.” 5. I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s representatives at Angora and Jedda, to His Majesty’s High Commissioner for Palestine and Transjordan, to the Government of India and to the Combined Middle East Intelligence Centre. I have, &amp;c. BASIL NEWTON. [16-34] P) Printed in italics. » 50*.. C'**r i • .5 UR 44 | I. DtA OFFICE Copy No. 9f; &gt; to su h %2 Enclosure. Proceedings of Parliament—the Senate—February 27, 1941. (Meeting at which the Senate discussed the Cabinet’s Programme of Policy.) I HE following is a translation of noteworthy speeches made at the above meeting and since published in the local press : — The Prime Minister, Taha-al-Hashimi. the Cabinet’s programme of policy, which has already been laid before the Chamber of Deputies, has now been distributed to you, and I beg leave of the House to say that I am prepared to answer any questions concerning the programme and make any explanations that may be asked for. J amil-cd-Madfai. We have read the programme, and we find it lacking in clarity in many respects, notwithstanding his Excellency the Prime Minister’s declaration that he loves frankness. In any case, I am of opinion that it is not programmes that matter, but deeds and achievements. We trust that the present Cabinet will so act as to retrieve the many mistakes of the past. In a previous statement his Excellency the Prime Minister made a remark suggesting that there was no propaganda or foreign interference. / regret to say that I disagree with his Excellency on this point, for propaganda exists in fact together with foreign intrigues, and tens of thousands of dinars are being spent for these purposes. I fear lest the contention that nothing of the sort exists should mean that we are not going to adopt a resolute policy for the repression of promoters of propaganda and intrigues, which might lead to the destruction of our national existence. Gentlemen, our political position is well known and so are our economic interests and our geographical situation. As I pointed out on a previous occasion, our national existence stands on three main planks, of which one is the alliance with Britain. Since the conclusion of that alliance things have been going on smoothly, good accord and understanding prevailing between the two parties, and thioughout the period of alliance nothing occurred between ourselves and our Ally of a nature calculated to violate or infringe our independence nor has there been any interference in our domestic affairs. But foreign propaganda agents, seeking to take advantage of the^ simplicity and good-heartedness of Iraqis and concerned only with promoting the policy and interests of the particular countries on behalf of which they act, even though their activities might spell death and, destruction for other nations and peoples have been promoting and inspiring the evil idea that there has been interference on the part of our Ally and demands of a nature which the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty neither upholds nor justifies. Both myself and certain members of the Chamber of Deputies, including, as far as I can remember, his Excellency Saiyid Abdul Mahdi, asked questions concerning rumours about such demands at the Finance Committee of the Chamber. The Prime Minister at the time denied that there had been any interference or demands of a nature calculated to bring about misunderstanding between ourselves and our Ally. But hardly had a few davs elapsed on that denial of his than the former Prime Minister again alleged that among the reasons for his resignation was foreign interference, seeking thereby to justify the errors committed during his administration. . Gentlemen, it is absolutely inadmissible for us to delay or shirk the adoption of a resolute policy for the suppression of this propaganda, which is detrimental to the existence of the State. Likewise, it is absolutely inadmissible for us to throw ashes over a fire and declare that the fire was non-existent. Gentlemen, a fire exists, and it must be extinguished lest it should o-et alive again and spread about upon some opportunity afforded it. I confidently hope that the men now in power will succeed in the adoption of such policy. We shall support them with all our might as long as we see them seeking the realisation of the aims and objects dictated by the country’s interest3 N aji-al-Suwaidi. . The explanation of programmes of policy and the answer to questions raised in connexion with such explanations are matters for the Prime Minister responsible for such policy. The former Prime Minister not being a member of this House, while I myself had been driven by circumstances to serve on the last ^Cabinet, I consider it my duty to explain to the House certain points which I ^consider should be explained. The causes of the resignation of the last Cabinet, which have given rise to so many rumours and unfounded statements, are not attributable to any essential difference about the provision^ of the treaty or any other instrument. As was desired by members of the House, the last Cabinet pursued a policy of mutual co-operation and collaboration among its leading members and the country’s prominent leaders. That policy aimed at the maintenance of peace, tranquillity and stability in the country during the violent world struggle. Getting into touch with the Majlis, we found that that body, with the public opinion behind it, upheld that policy and the course it followed. Matters continued like that until that sudden declaration which followed the stand taken by the former Government in advocating slow deliberation over the questio7i of severing relations with the Italian Government following the declaration of war by the latter against the Allies. As Iraq had severed her relations with the German Government immediately upon the outbreak of war between Germany and the Allies, it was desired that we should act similarly in the case of Italy. We considered, however, that political circumstances required that we should proceed carefully and slmvly about such a delicate course of policy, and should take no step before first ascertaining the likely consequences to the country of the decision which was to be taken. Such were the causes of the first crisis, which gave rise to a variety of rumours, including one that certain propaganda was afoot of a nature calculated to lead the country to an unknown end. When the Iraqi Government had suddenly sprung upon them “ those declarations ” they considered it their duty not to afford any opportunity for our national problems to take a course calculated to undermine the future existence of the State. For we had seen in the past that any Cabinet act involving a going- back on the principles of independence would ultimately prove disastrous for the country, constituting a precedent which would be seized upon by the adversary to strike the nation and the country. Observers can rightly claim that the recent crisis between the “ higher quarters in the State ” and the Government was not the outcrop of foreign interference. Developments had led to personal rivalry and personal disputes. Nevertheless, the fact is that the causes of the last events lay in the original crisis. . . . By our stand we wished to show our ally that the Iraqination is independent in her affairs. I regret, however, to say that folloiving on the acquisition by her of the status of an independent State, by her admission into the League of Nations under the provisions of the last Anglo-lraqi Treaty, Iraq failed fully to exercise her rights as an independent State, and neither the people nor foreign Govern ments had impressed upon them the fact that the State of Iraq is a fully independent State. I contend before this House that the stand taken by Iraq over the question of severance of relations with Italy was a cause for general gratification in Iraq, inspired complete confidence in the Government, and served to prove that Iraq had a “ political existence ” which she is able to demonstrate by the exercise of her political and administrative rights as an independent State. It is contended, on the other hand, that that stand on the part of Iraq has had the result of enabling the adversaries to disseminate propaganda harmful to the policy of our ally and also to the policy of Iraq. This is a question of administration, responsibility for which rests upon the departments and Ministers concerned. At the same time it must be noted that propaganda has not been confined to one party. It is a weapon which both parties have been using here as well as elsewhere. The former Cabinet took no rash or imprudent acts of a nature calculated to undermine the existence of Iraq. They only sought to keep Iraq away from the calamities of war and to avoid getting involved in the violent struggle between powerful nations. [16—34] b 2 /4 As to the question of upholding the rights of the nation and of the legislature, with which rights certain quarters and forces have, it is said, been interfering, we all know that Iraq is a constitutional parliamentary State in which affairs cannot proceed properly unless equilibrium is maintained between the legislative and executive powers. All of us are, however, aivare of the fact that all the higher quarters and forces in the State have acted together for the suppression of^ Parliament and the rights of the people and have sought to deny Parliament all opportunity properly to carry out its mission of representing the people. As a result that authority, which we had intended to establish as the “ supreme authority and arbitrator in the State ” has beconfe ineffective. Successive Iraqi Governments, including the present Government, failed to think of restoring to the legislative power its prestige and influence. Unless that power has its prestige and prerogatives restored to it, we shall never he secure against other Powers interfering and controlling the affairs of the State, as the case is at present. On the contrary, we shall have to expect such interference from all sorts of quarters as may choose to interfere. There has already been interference of this kind by armed tribes, which was followed by similar interference by another armed force which came to strike those tribes. If we wish to remove this second force from the field, we must set up in its stead another force—that of the people. Unless the Legislature is accorded its right of self-defence, whereby a balance of powers will be established in the State, some other force is bound to emerge and take over control of the affairs of the State by constitutional or other means. Responsible men should, therefore, consider the setting up of a “popular force ” to uphold the Legislature, acting as supreme controlling authority over the Government and doing what is necessary in the interest of the country. This is all the information I have to give to the House to show the good intentions I and my colleagues had. If we have erred in any respect, well different people take different views of things, and everyone has his own views. Jalal Baban. I must thank his Excellency A1 Suwaidi for the explanations he has made, for these explanations afford us opportunity to speak. I do not deny that it is necessary to act together and oppose unjustifiable foi eign demands and also to assume before the foreigner the attitude of one who is sti'ong and independent. On the other hand, we must not forget that it is equally necessary to ensure good understanding and keep the way open for the purpose as may be necessary in the interest of the country. If we review the political histoiy of nations, we shall find manv instances of a Cabinet bavin 01 been changed to ensure understanding sought in the interest of the country concerned As regards the proceedings of the former Cabinet, I do not wish to deal with this subject at great length. I would, therefore, begin from a certain point namely, that Sunday meeting of the Cabinet at which his Excellency A l Hashimi spoke, declaring: “It has become necessary for us to resign, our continuing in office having become detrimental to the public interestP This declaration by his Excellency Al Hashimi was received with approval by all his colleagues Subsequently, the Cabinet, with the exception of its chief, decided to resign Taking this event as a starting-point, l may now continue. Following on the Cabinet's decision to resign, we saw a new chapter open at sunset and close at sunrise on the following day. With the close of that chapter a further painful one was opened. It was a chapter to be deplored by all Iraqis, for with it we reverted to the errors of the past, which we much needed avoiding. But how could those errors of the past be avoided, when some ones, as we have seen, would not hesitate for a moment to take any action agreeable to their own desires no matter how harmful such action might be for the State. These sufferings began with the event of the m,h October, 1936, known as the military coup d Etat, and the disastrous and unfortunate acts which characterised that event, such as hangings and martial law. The army was innocent of that event. I say so although I was abroad at the time. On my return home I made enquiries and found that the army was innocent of that coup d'Etat which was a painful movement undertaken by a handful of individuals acting for the furtherance of their purely individual aims. The movement, which had nothing to do whatever with the public interest, was unfortunately’ascribed to the army.Gentlemen, / believe that the honour of military officers is such as forbids them to allow themselves to act as tools of individuals seeking to exploit the army for their own personal benefit. A military officer believes that he is born to serve his country—and his country alone—and not to serve private individuals and undermine the existence of the State in the service of personal interests. I do not wish to hold in review past painful events, which began to he repeated of late. I beg leave of my colleague, his Excellency Nuri-al-Said, to say that even his fourth Cabinet was formed on the same lines. I say so, though it may hurt his Excellency, because I feel I must frankly state the truth, in order that we shall take lesson and be on our guard lest past painful events should be repeated. I shall now turn to another page of painful events: The former Cabinet resigned on Friday. In the afternoon and evening of that day handbills indicating the time and places for a demonstration against the neiv Goverurnent, were distributed by individuals moving about either on foot or in motor cats. On the following day meetings for demonstration purposes were held, but only in Government schools by the students of such schools. It is to be deplored that Government school students should embark on such activities. The Cabinet has been in office for over twenty days, almost a month, but has taken no action to indicate that it intends putting an end to such lamentable proceeding s. Gentlemen, the school students are themselves innocent of such activities. They must have been driven on that course by others. Now who can these others be ? I have little doubt that it was some schoolmasters who had instigated the students. Where is the Ministry of Education? Will that Ministry continue to maintain silence in the face of such proceedings? Does she propose to promote the spirit of chaos among the rising generation? _ I do not propose to speak at length about the Cabinet s programme of poke}, for it is acts and deeds and not programmes that really matter, and I expect good and wholesome deeds from the Hashimi Cabinet, and also the suppiession of .all harmful activities. ^ In their programme of policy the Cabinet speak of their desire that the Houses of Parliament shall exercise a controlling influence over the acts of the Government. We, however, find that the first action taken by the Government following on their declaration to this effect has been to prohibit the publication of statements made in the Chamber of Deputies, not a word of which has been published in the papers. Someone may perhaps contend, as some did on certain previous occasions, that it is up to newspapers themselves to publish or not to publish such statements. I however feel convinced that had newspapers been allowed to publish these statements’they would have published them to the last word and letter. 1 now wish to qo back to the deplorable events of the past, which 1 hope will not be repeated in future. I fervently request the responsible ones, in particular the Minister of Defence, to put definite end to proceedings of the nature alluded to I join his Excellency A l Madfai his remark that we must not the fire with ashes and then declare that there is no fire. I am afraid that, if we continue to hide fire with ashes, we shall one day regret this sort of conduct on our part, but regret would then be of no avail. Ridha-al-Shabibi. I had liked to declare myself content with the valuable words of his Excellency Al Madfai in which he expressed his views on Iraq's foreign relations and on the form which, according to his convictions, these relations should assume But 1 altered my mind upon hearing the speech made by his Excellency Al Suwaidi countering the views on Iraq’s foreign policy put forward by his Excellency Al Madfai. I myself belong to the group of men who have been maintaining an attitude of strict neutrality in regard to the present war and international struo-rie. I was, and am still, of opinion that Iraq s interest lies entirely in her teaders adopting and always maintaining the same attitude m both then utterances and their acts. , , . . * u We however observe that since the outbreak of the war our country has been it ’is to be deplored, divided into two camps, one upholding one party to the war and one the other. Rival propaganda has no doubt been influential in bringing about this dissension.6 e I would like to ask A1 Suwaidi to say whether foreign propaganda has been free from bias, and whether it has not, on certain occasions, constituted a danger to Iraq and a factor making for the confusion of public opinion. 1 earnestly pray A1 Suwaidi to answer this question frankly, for it is not in the interest of our country to keep facts concealed. Gentlemen, the Chamber now faces a new Cabinet, the fourth, I believe, since 1939. The Cabinet which relinquished office on the 25th December, 1938, advocated a policy of “ Let bygones be bygones.” Opposition politicians and succeeding Cabinets criticised that policy and condemned it, and the struggle between the advocates of that policy and those who oppose it has continued ever since, though occasionally taking an unopen form. I have no desire to point out the methods and means resorted to by certain Cabinets to secure office. These are too well known to need pointing out. I would, however, like to point out that the period I am speaking of was characterised by a series of trials and errors, as a result of which the country has suffered considerably. The history of that period, however, testifies to the wholesome nature of the policy of “Let bygones be bygones” and to the spirit of genuine patriotism and appreciation of the public interest which inspired that policy. Gentlemen, one cannot leave the subject without taking up the last major crisis which led to the present Cabinet taking over the reins of public affairs. That crisis persisted for some three or four months. It was at last declared that the continuance in power of the last Cabinet was no longer desirable, and the Cabinet collapsed in the manner known to you after having committed so many errors. Then came the present Cabinet with its programme of policy which is now before vou. The opening clause in the Cabinet's programme of policy provides for the discharge of the national mission Iraq has taken upon herself to carry through, and also for the consolidation of relations with the sister Arab countries. It is good that Iraq should have a national policy. Having, however, pledged myself to be frank, I suggest that we should first come to agreement over the significance of the term “ national mission ” or “ national policy.” Because of the strong bearing this mission or policy has on our national existence and our political and social affairs, it forms one of the most important questions being discussed in this Assembly and by the people and in the press. What, I wonder, does this so-called “national mission” consist off 1 have observed that there are some who believe that stigmatising one's own compatriots close at home and showing animosity and dislike for them on the ground of showinp sympathy with more-distant kinsmen is not a thing incompatible with the “national mission” (? A sly allusion to anti-Shia spirit among Sunnis in Iraq—Translator ) Such is the logic of the hallucinated and the fanciful—a vicious logic which continues a factor making for dissension in this country. When we, together with the fair- minded ones, declaied that it was disastrous for Iraq to give such interpretation to nationalism, they refused to be convinced. Besides, there are certain newspapers, both here and abroad, who wish to live on ill-gotten money. The Government should therefore decide a sound definition of national policy free from fantastic conceptions and of practicable character, in which regard should be had to conditions in Iraq and special interests of country. I much wish responsible men would show a great measure of frankness on this subject j j ' We view with approbation the Government’s determined resolve to uphold the provisions of the Constitution and to strengthen parliamentary life We do not. however, wish that parliamentary life should be a mere form or show and an exhibition of dolls manipulated by individuals. We want the institution of Parliament to be an effective factor working for the upliftment of the country and the warding-off of he danger of tyranny. Parliamentary life should ensure ofX pSs.^ benieS ' ln Par * iCUlar ’ fl ' eed0m of °P-io„ and freedom Recently the publication was prohibited of the proceedings of the Legislature Ibis prohibition has no parallel except in the rei^n of Abdul Hamid r • i, the Prime Minister would state his vie'ws on the subject cltarlv forThe Cabme’t s programme of policy is ambiguous on this point. ... ‘ oamnets7 Nuri-al-Said. After a general reference to recent events in Iraq, Nuri-al-Said wished the meeting was in camera in order that he might speak with greater freedom and then proceeded as follows, referring to the speech of Naji-al-Suwaidi :— 41 His Excellency (Naji-al-Suwaidi) opened his speech by ascribing the cause of the crisis to the failure to break off relations with the Italian Government. Gentlemen, I assure you that the question of breaking off relations with the Italian Government was not the direct cause of that violent crisis When, in June last, Italy entered the war, we discussed at the Council of Ministers the advisability of proceeding slowly about the breaking-off of relations with Italy, on two grounds : firstly, the collapse of France, following which it was difficult to appraise the position of Britain, and, secondly, the desire on our part to ascertain the attitude of the Egyptian and Turkish Governments. So we decided to wait for a while until the situation created by France’s collapse had been cleared up and the attitude of Egypt and Turkey had become clear. Accordingly, to speak of the non-breaking-off of relations with Italy as having been the direct cause of the crisis is incorrect. During the six months which followed that decision nothing arose between the British Embassy and the Iraqi Government of a nature suggesting that any problems had arisen on account of the said decision. The crisis had existed long before that date. During the course of last summer we made attempts at solving these crises, undertaking for the purpose several journeys by air and rail. These crises, however, had nothing to do with our relations with Italy or any other country, nor with any interference on the part of the British Embassy, as some believe or claim. Gentlemen, Iraq’s relations with Britain are relations of allicmce, determined by treaty, and, contrary to the views advanced by some, Iraq cannot adopt an attitude of neutrality so long as the Treaty of A lliance stands and is not denounced or altered by either party. It is not right that we should impress upon public opinion the wrong idea that we are neutrals. The treaty defines our obligations in time of war as well as in time of peace, and in the war our country is a non belligerent State. It is true that we are an independent State and that every such State can dispose of its affairs as it likes. But should the fact that we are conscious of our independence induce us to neglect thinking about our interests, instead of acting to remove such harm as our country may suffer and to promote further its welfare ? If we find that certain activities calculated to create for us difficulties with our Ally are incompatible with our general policy, we should take steps to suppress such activities. An independent country must discharge its respon sibilities at a time such as the present and the leaders of such country must enlighten public opinion and not allow it to grope about in darkness. If any man among the men of Iraq has any new policy, other than the one just alluded to, and he believes it to be in the interests of Iraq, then let such man boldly and courageously reveal that policy of his. / have not, however, come across or heard of any man in Iraq, whether in a place of responsibility or otherwise, who differs from the one commonly held view that Iraq must maintain the policy of alliance with Britain and avoid any act likely to prove detrimental to that policy and, ultimately, to the interest of Iraq. Being as we are all agreed upon that course of policy, it only remains for us courageously and frankly to follow it, affording no opportunity for action by those wishing to play foul with the country's destinies. Gentlemen, so much for our relations with the British Government.^ As regards present policy and the immediate future, by which lattei term I lexei to the time when the present war is over, I am among those who believe that the present world situation affords a great opportunity for all peoples, particularly small ones, to obtain a larger measure of justice than they were able to obtain in the past. It would appear to me that “ matters ” [sic] will no longer remain in the hands of one nation or of a limited number of nations, but that all the nations of the world, including the peoples of the American Continent, will enter the held. We must, therefore, seek to prepare for ourselves conditions better than those in which we have lived in the past and secure for ourselves a greater position than that we were able to secure in the past ....£ 8 This State is founded on a Constitution in which Parliament forms the corner-stone. In recent years a series of events took place in which Parliament was smitten and dissolved. At the time some of those events happened I myself was among those responsible for the course followed. Parliament has become incapable of functioning. Upon careful consideration we shall find that the^ cause for this lies in the Electoral Law, which dates back to eighty years ago. Parliament cannot truly represent public opinion unless the existing Electoral Law is replaced by a new law fashioned on more up-to-date lines. Unless a Deputy feels that he had been elected exclusively by the will of the people, und' not as a nominee of the Government, and that if he leaves his seat as a result of the dissolution of the Chamber he would be re-elected and reinstated by the people, he cannot speak frankly and insist on his views or offer opposition to the Govern ment when he sees the latter depart from the constitutional and other laws, nor would he withdraw his confidence from the Government and bring about its downfall. Without such conviction on the part of its members Parliament cannot truly represent the nation. Note.— The remainder of Nuri Pasha’s speech is devoted to emphasising the above point about strengthening the hand of Parliament to enable it to exercise the necessary check upon the proceedings of the Executive. The Prime Minister, Taha-al-Hashimi. After thanking Senators for their speeches and remarks, the Prime Minister proceeded as follows :— The first point I wish to take up is the remark made that the Cabinet s programme of policy is ambiguous, and that it is complementary to the programme of the former Cabinet. There is nothing in the programme to show that it is complementary to that of the former Cabinet. It only says that the Cabinet will carry through certain portions of the programme of the former Cabinet which accorded with the wishes of the nation and remained on hand unattended to. A change of Cabinet does not mean undoing useful work accomplished by the outgoing Cabinet. The second point I wish to take up is that concerning foreign propaganda. In my recent statement in Parliament and on the 6th February I did not suggest that there was no foreign propaganda about. I only said that the resignation of the Cabinet was not due to foreign influence at play. In all countries, no matter how strong and independent or how solidly united the people might be, foreign propaganda agents are maintained to undertake propaganda on behalf of other countries interested. As you know from the experience of the last war, the weapon of propaganda is made use of by all nations. So propaganda is an unavoidable evil, but, no matter how extensive propaganda might be, it is of no consequence for a solidly united nation whose solidarity will render it immune against propaganda. His Excellency Senator A1 Suwaidi, not being in a place of responsibility, deemed it fit to raise and discuss certain questions which a person in a place of responsibility would hesitate to discuss in great detail. Nevertheless, I can declare that a party to an alliance is entitled, even in time of peace, to invite the attention of his ally to certain matters which he considers might adversely affect the interests covered by the alliance. The case is even more so in time of war. As regards the other point raised by his Excellency A1 Suwaidi, namely, that about “ sudden declarations,” I would point out that a written statement was tendered in which the attention of the Iraqi Government was invited to two matters. Apart from that statement in writing, there was nothing but verbal talks of which no written record was made. It may be claimed otherwise. This, however, does not matter. What matters is that the Iraqi Government have a right to protest against foreign interference. As I pointed out at the Chamber of Deputies, our national existence was established by sacrifices made by the sons of this country, and it must be maintained and safeguarded. We are unwilling that a Government should rise or resign by foreign influence. His Excellency Senator Jalal Baban drew the attention of the Government to the question of handbills and demonstrations. The Government have caused enquiries to be made into the case with a view to discovering the instigators.9 and, if any officials are found to have been guilty of instigations, the Government will not fail to take disciplinary action against them. .... His Excellency Senator Jalal Baban, and also his Excellency Senatoi A1 Shabibi, raised the question of the publication of speeches oi Senators am Deputies and of the proceedings of parliamentary meetings. As I have already declared at the Chamber of Deputies, the Government have no intention o prohibiting the publication of such matter in the press. I he Government are, however, entitled to prohibit the publication of speeches made in Parhamen unless they are copied from the official minutes or from accounts drawn up by t e official parliamentary reporters; these alone are authentic and dependable. . s far as I know, the speeches of the Deputies are being published in the press to-c a&gt;- In regard to the different interpretations being made by legal men ol the word “ neutrality ” and the significance of the word, we may let legal men continue disputing among themselves on the subject. What we^ know, however, is that, havina ream'd to the terms of the treaty, we are non-belligerent Allies His Excellency Senator A1 Shabibi has asked for a definition of the “ National Mission ” and what it stands for. As far as I and the Iraqi Govern ment know, the “ National Mission ” means endeavour by diplomatic means tor Arabs to obtain their rights in accordance with promises and pledges and the Covenant of the League of Nations. . Note.— The remainder of the Prime Minister’s statement in reply is devoted to the questions of {a) strengthening the hand of Parliament and (b) the fair distribution of justice, and his words on both subjects emphasise the desire and intention of the Cabinet to do all that is possible towards strengthening the hand of Parliament and ensuring the fair distribution o^ justice. Abdul Muhsin Shilash. After referring to the preceding speeches, particularly those of Jamil-al- Madfai, Nuri-al-Said, Ridha-al-Shabibi and Naji-al-Suwaidi, Abdul Muhsin Shilash proceeded as follows :— I believe that his Excellency the former Prime Minister, Saiyid Nuri-al-Said, should have spoken in more explicit and plain terms. His Excellency the Prime Minister declared that the “ statement” dealt with two matters, and that, apart from it, there had been certain verbal talks. Such written communication and such verbal talks are no matter for surprise, for we are bound up with Britain by a treaty which has been upheld by successive Governments, in their programmes of policy, including even the former and the present' Governments. What we really seek to ascertain is whether the differences which cropped up had arisen from the process of implementing the provisions of the treaty or from some other 'cause. According to the statements made by the former Prime Minister, there is no difference between the Iraqi Government and our ally. I have no desire to dwell at length on this question, and I would content myself with the statement made by his Excellency the present Prime Minister. Nevertheless, I feel impelled as a matter of duty to point out that it was the crisis that compelled the Supreme Authority to leave the capital. This is a grave matter which we must reflect upon, but over which secrecy has been maintained. Gentlemen, the Iraqi Constitution is no longer respected. This indictment is impliedly confirmed by the statements of his Excellency the Prime Minister. If that was not the case, the Prime Minister had no cause to lay emphasis in his Cabinet programme on the intention of upholding the Constitution. / beg leave, Gentlemen, to declare that the Supreme Authority must remain respected and honoured under all circumstances, to act as final authority for the solution of grave problems. Had there been no good cause dictated by the needs of the country, the Constitution would not have provided for the sort of preroga tives vested in the Supreme Authority in order to have recourse to the latter in critical times. I uphold his Excellency Al Shabibi in his remark about the term “ national mission ” occurring in the Cabinet’s programme of policy. I realise, as all of us do, that this and' like terms are used by sincere men with, no doubt, good intention. Nevertheless, their use is likely on certain occasions to promote [16—34] r10 ✓ 'propaganda of a nature harmf ul to our country with the possibility of making it impossible for Iraq thoroughly to fulfil the national mission in its true sense Clause 4 in the Cabinet’s programme of policy speaks of the fair distribution ot justice and of promoting a sense of duty and faithfulness to one’s work among a 1 members of the people^ This is very good in principle; but I beg leave of his Excellency the Prime Minister to point out that the people have come to be in gieatei need of practical results than of fine words recorded on paper. With her admission into the League of Nations, Iraq became an independent State for the purpose of the administration of her domestic affairs. We all know that since then the British have been letting us alone and have not interfered in our affairs. / believe that for such distressful events as we have gone through and for the lack of respect for our laws, as well as for acts of maladministration leading to instability of conditions—for all these responsibility rests upon us we having failed m our duties.' y ' ’ M usta fa-al- U mari. Aftei summarising the speeches which preceded his and expressing himself in agreement with the speakers on many points in their speeches, particularly the desirability of keeping the army out of politics and upholding the authority of Parliament, Mustafa-al-Umari remarked that these desiderata had been repeated and emphatically expressed in the past, but little had been actually done to realise them. ^ A bdul Mahdi, Minister of Economics. Saiyid Abdul Mahdi spoke very shortly emphasising the need for stability, which, he said, was felt by all, and expressing the hope that common efforts will be directed towards securing stable conditions in the country. Taufiq-al-Suwaidi, Foreign Minister. His Excellency the Prime Minister has spoken at such length on the points laised by honourable Senators that I feel I need not take up except a few simple points. To begin with, it is not the practice in parliamentary countries for public assemblies to discuss at length and great detail matters of foreign policy. There are special committees to discuss details of questions of foreign affairs before such questions are laid before the whole House. Gentlemen, that the public should say or hear that Mr. So-and-so has spoken on foreign matters is of no consequence. What actually matters is to get solved delicate problems of foreign relations, proceeding about the job wisely and rationally. What matters still more is maintaining secrecy about such matters. I believe that the House shares with me the opinion that such matters should not be discussed in open assemblies, the main object in discussing them being only to serve the interests of the country. I may now take up another question on which several Senators have spoken including his Excellency Senator Shilash, who agrees with others that this country has been exercising its rights, in both domestic and foreign fields, in the manner we had sought, without foreign interference; while in regard to the conduct of our ally, it has been entirely in accord with her undertakings and with the provisions of the Treaty of Alliance The remark has been made that the non-severance of relations with Italy has gratified public opinion. Well, Gentlemen, in matters of foreign relations among States it is not gratification of public opinion alone that should be sought nor are questions of foreign affairs and of consolidation of relations among States dealt ^ with on the basis of ensuring gratif cation of public opinion. Such questions are dealt with on other bases, such as international standing, inter national undertakings, neighbourly relations and treaties. I do not believe it to be in the interest of either the people or the State that the whole nation should be acquainted with such matters of detail. One of France's greatest men Talleyrand, said: “ Man is given a tongue not to reveal his conscience but to suppress it'; while Plato says: cc We must not tell the people all that we know.'11 Jalal Baban. Speaking again, now in reply to Nuri-al-Said, who, he said, might have taken exception to his remark that the fourth Saidi Cabinet had been formed on the same lines as the last four or five Cabinets in Iraq, during whose administra tions Iraq was the scene of a series of painful events, Jalal Baban said :— “ Gentlemen, the record of the last few years has indeed been a painful one. From the Cabinet of A1 Aiyubi down to that of A1 Madfai and the late Yasin-al-Hashimi and succeeding ones, we have gone through a succession of events full of pain such as we cannot at all conceal. I have no desire now to dwell at length on those events. I would only call upon those in places of responsibility, in the name of the public interest and the State, not to deny these events. “ As regards my remark addressed to his Excellency A1 Hashimi concerning his speech at the Council of Ministers, I am aware that no speeches were delivered on that occasion. I referred to his few words on the occasion by the term ‘ speech ' only by way of denoting my great appreciation of his words, which had such a high purpose and object in view.” Muhammad Ridha-al-Shabibi. In this second speech of his, A1 Shabibi, taking up the Prime Minister’s reply to his request for a definition of the term ££ national mission,” and to his further request for freedom for the press to publish the proceedings of Parliament, said :— ££ The definition given by his Excellency the Prime Minister is quite reasonable, and is as should be. I would, however, add that the objects of the national mission should include the strengthening of cultural and economic relations between Iraq and other Arab countries, and the rendering of such aid as may be possible to render to the sons of Arab countries. On this we are all agreed. The fact, however, remains that many people have misunderstood the real purpose of the national mission, and have been acting wrongly under this misunderstanding. This has been the case for a long time, and a grave responsibility rests upon the Government in this connexion. That responsibility consists of stating the fact about the nature of the national mission, indicating what part of that mission is possible of discharge by the people and Government of Iraq acting together, and what part is impossible of being carried through ££ As regards the question of the freedom of opinion and freedom of the press, the press was actually prohibited from the publication of matter the publication of which is authorised under the Constitution. Contrary to what was suggested by the Prime Minister in his statement in reply, the question must not be left to the intention of the Government, as the Constitution is explicit on this right of the people which must not be made the subject of individual interpretation I would therefore request his Excellency the Prime Minister to reconsider the matter and to ensure for the nation its rights as laid down in the Constitution.” Mahmud Subhi-aTDaftari. There is nothing noteworthy in this Senator’s speech, apart from his concurrence in the view that details of foreign policy should not be publicly discussed in open house in Parliament, and his statement that he appro\es of the Cabinet’s programe of policy, which approval he, however, qualifies with the remark that: £ £ It is not programmes that actually matter but the actual execution thereof.” Daud-al-Chalabi. Daud-al-Chalabi dealt only with two of the many questions raised in the course of the meeting, namely, (a) the question of upholding the authority of Parliament, and (b) propaganda. In regard to (a), he suggests certain amendments to the Electoral Law designed to ensure that half the total number of Deputies shall be elected on thenomination of the people themselves, and advocates freedom of formation of political parties. In regard to the other question, he said :— “ In regal'd to propaganda, as already remarked by his Excellency the Prime Minister, propaganda is undertaken by all States in the countries of others an d cannot be at all suppressed. In admitting this fact I further admit that,&amp; according to what we hear and see, propaganda exists of a nature at variance with the Government's desire to proceed in accordance with the Treaty. If those concerned wish to render such propaganda ineffective, they must search out the cause why so many people are affected by such propaganda contrary to the wishes of the Government.'‘4 INDEXED ^WSth the Compliments of the Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affair* r Y [CYPKER].

Practically all Iraqi reinforcements sent to Basra have now withdrawn to Musayib and garrison dispositions at Basra are now normal. One infantry brigade from KirkuK and one artillery brigade from' Table Mountain have been brought to Bagdad. Deduction to be made from these movements seems to be that Iraqi military commanders are giving up all holding Basra but are taking steps to be in a position to hold Bagdad securely and to oppose if necessary any large movements of British troops from Basra northwards and their establishment in the Bagdad area. No opposition is likely however to be offered to movement of small bodies of British troops along the lines of communication. Possibility of active German co-operation with Iraq troops cannot be ruled out, but any attack on Habbaniya without such co-operation appears unlikely at present.

On the other hand Iraqi Minister had just seen him and assured him that Iraqi Government wanted to do everything possible to assist us and entirely agreed to the presence of troops. Minister had read the Minister for Foreign Affairs a telegram in this sense. Minister/went on to express personal views as to need to support His Majesty*s Government and undesirability of a German success in Iraq which would result in the splitting up of the country into its component parts. 2. Minister for Foreign Affairs explained this contradiction to himself by concluding that, while Iraqi Government in direct dealing with us wished to stand strictly on their rights, in speaking to him they wished (without giving way on points of principle) to intimate that in practice they agreed with what we were doing c I said that we still had no confidence in Rashid Ali« 5. In answer to your telegram under reference Minister for Foreign Affairs said that instructions had already been sent at the time ^ 909 that Turkish^ representative should resume normal relations' with Iraqi Government. Minister for Foreign Affairs was vague as to exactly what had been implied but I gathered, though no question of de jure recognition had been mentioned, normal official relations had been opened.

General policy of His Majesty’s Government. Our chief interest in sending troops to Iraq is the covering and establishment of a great assembly base at Basra, and what happens up-country, except at Habbaniya, is at the present time on an altogether lower priority. Our rights under the Treaty were invoked to cover disembarkation of troops and to avoid bloodshed, but force would have been used to the utmost limit to secure the disembarkation if necessary. Our position at Basra is of course covered by Article 4 of the Treaty, but it also may be regarded as a new event arising out of the war. No undertaKings can be given that troops will be sent northwards or moved through ro Palestine, and the right to require such undertakings I should not be recognised in respect of a,Government which has in itself usurped power by a coup d’etat, or in a country ' where our Treaty rights have so long oeen frustrated in the spirit. Explanations had better in any case be avoided as far as possible in dealing with Iraqi authorities. 3. Basra. Troops which have arrived in Iraq will remain at 4. Intention is that second brigade shall sail from India second week in May. Third brigade will follow some time in June. Final decision has not yet been taken regarding disposal of these further troops. It is possible that some may be stationed at Habbaniya, and some pass through to Palestine or Trans Jordan where they would remain as a striking force if required. Much will depend upon the views of General Officer Commanding Basra regarding the number of troops required to ensure security of base there. Question will not arise till arrival of further troops, and you should in the meantime consult with General Fraser, bearing in mind that security of base at Basra and of air station at Habbaniya must have priority over passage of troops through to Palestine. 5.

It is possible that at instigation of Rashid Ali or the Axis Iranian G-overnment may attempt to raise objections to British troops being transported up Shatt al Arab by His / Majesty’s Ships, arguing that this involves passage through/ Iranian, v/aters. * 2. Our action is fully covered by Article A of Anglo- Iraqi Treaty, while so far as Iran is concerned rights of Iraq and her obligations to His Majesty’s G-overnment are reserved in paragraph A of Protocol of 1937 Treaty between Iraq and Iran. If Iranian G-overnment should attempt to raise difficulties, you may make it abundantly clear from the outset that it would serve no useful purpose to transmit such communications to London, for His Majesty’s G-overnment certainly intend to exercise their Treaty rights so far as they may consider this to be required by the war situation. —AT—' 2 5 DO 1 r n INDIA OFFICEm OUTWARD TELEGRAM m r : [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and should be IMMEDIATE.

His Majesty’s Government regarded this as test case and His Majesty's Ambassador accordingly informed him on April 16th that provided unconditional cooperation was forthcoming for opening line of communications, His Majesty's Government for their part would be prepared to enter at once into informal relations with his Government, and accord full recognition to new rdgime as soon as there has been sufficient time to judge whether the new rdgime is capable of acting up to Rashid Ali’s own assurances. 2.

MON1H has passed since Genejal Taha-al-Hashimi became Prime Minister, and it is well to consider what his Cabinet has achieved and what course it is likely to try to follow in the future. f he two principal tasks which lay before the new Prime Minister when he came into office on the 1st February were to improve relations with His Majesty s Government and to curb the power of the military clique wffiich had played so prominent and so unconstitutional a part in the events which led up to Rashid Ali’s resignation. d. Up to the present he has done little to dispose of either. There is some negative improvement in his attitude as compared with that of Rashid Ali—he does not seem to be intriguing so directly with the Axis or to be in such close collusion with the military clique—but he has taken no positive steps either to give satisfaction to the more pressing requests of His Majesty’s Government or to prevent further interference from the army in the government of the country. 4. In his short speech to the Chamber when Parliament was adjourned for twenty days on the 6th February he accepted the somewhat ambiguous statement of foreign policy made by his predecessor, and in the programme given to the Chamber on the 22nd Februar y (my telegram No 159 of the 23r d February) the same principles were reaffirmed There is excellent reason to believe that he sought Rashid Ali’s approval of the Cabinet’s programme in draft, and at Rashid Ali’s instance added a reference to the “ national mission undertaken by Iraq.” ^ 5. When he first took office General Taha seems to have hoped that the unfortunate impression made on His Majesty’s Government by Rashid Ali’s Administration would be effaced merely by a change of Government and without a specific advance towards the satisfaction of British requirements. It has since been made clear to him that this was a mistake, but he has not yet shown himself capable of taking the remedial action which the situation demands. Even in the comparatively small and quite straightforward matter of the appointment of a British Director-General of Railways, Taha Pasha’s Cabinet has attempted to continue the tactics of evasion and delay adopted since last summer. 6. One of the Prime Minister’s chief difficulties is his fear of Rashid Ali and his supporters, but instead of dealing with this danger by taking the initiative in the attack, he is looking for compromise and appeasement. His attitude towards the military clique is similarly irresolute. 7. As I have already reported i n my telegram No. 148, I have spoken to both the Prime Minister and the MinisteUfor Foreign Affairs vefy plainly about the responsibilities of the new Government for remedying the mistakes of their pre decessors and for preventing a resumption by a few officers of the political activities which recently threatened the stability of the Iraqi State and pre judiced the good relations of Iraq with Great Britain. I have also maintained pressure on the new Cabinet to bring them to break off diplomatic relations with Italy, but, quite apart from his personal inclinations to sit firmly on the fence, Taha-al-FIashimi has evidently not the strength of mind to face the storm which he fears that the Mufti and the army clique would raise if he were to give the Italian Legation their passports. In this he shows himself to be not only timid but also a poor judge of a political situation, for there is small doubt but that he could rally to his support most of the Senators and Deputies and the best and strongest tribal elements in the provinces for a determined blow at army interference in politics. Taufiq Suwaidi, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and perhaps the only man in the Cabinet capable of influencing the Prime Minister, takes a somewhat different view from his chief. He sincerely wishes to keep the army out of politics and is perhaps ready himself to face a break with Italy. [16—33] ECTf^t 1c If8. In the debate on the Government’s programme which took place in the Chamber on the 24th February (my despatch No. 88 of the 27 th February) the Prime Minister came under fire both from the supporters of Rashid Ali and from those who are anxious to see effective action taken to put a stop to military inter ference in politics. To the former, who challenged his earlier denial of Rashid Ali's allegation that the resignation of the late Cabinet had been brought abour^-. by foreign influence, he replied by reasserting his view that Rashid Ali and hi**- colleagues had resigned because the Regent had refused a dissolution and to the latter, who demanded guarantees that recent deplorable events would not be repeated, he offered an assurance that it would be his purpose to uphold the con stitutional authority of Parliament. This assurance is, I am told, regarded as being of little value by the majority of the Chamber, but in the opinion of most Deputies there is no likelihood that the matter will be carried to the point of a vote of confidence. Only about two weeks remain of the present session, and the general opinion seems to be that Parliament, though thoroughly dissatisfied with the Government’s lack of a firm policy, will go into recess without attempting to force a change. 9. Outside Parliament it seems that Rashid Ali, with his following of pan-Arab extremists and pro-Nazi elements and the four senior officers who are the leaders of the army clique, remain in close touch with each other and there is talk of plots to restore Rashid Ali to power. There is also ground for the belief that Rashid Ali is seeking, though probably without much success, to consolidate a personal backing among certain tribal elements in the middle Euphrates. His principal confederate in this movement appears to be Sheikh Abdul Wahid of the Fatlah. . 10. On the other hand, Jamil Madfai and his numerous political and tribal friends and supporters continue to work for action against the military clique and for a better understanding with Great Britain. 11. In the light of the facts reviewed above, it seems that Taha Pasha can only find active support by giving satisfaction to either Rashid Ali or Jamil Madfai. So far he has hesitated between the two and has been unable to satisfy either, but, in spite of the consequent weakness of his position, he will probably trv to'steer a middle course until war developments in the spring show on which side it will be safe to put the helm hard over. General Taha is certainly an improvement on his predecessor and may lie given credit by us for having been attacked recently on the German radio. Nevertheless, it is impossible to repose confidence in him, and if the result of our pressure is to expedite his resignation, this should clear the way for a worthier successor. 12 I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty s representatives at Cairo. Angora, Tehran and Jedda, to the Government of India, to His Majesty’s High Commissioner for Palestine and Transjordan, and to the Combined Middle East Intelligence Centre, Cairo. I have, &amp;&lt;:.

I hope it is ' realized that this country has heen thoroughly prepared for fifth column action. Danger of early flare-up by Germany is a real one and at present our friends are not in a position to i resist it except with our help from Basra. The Government and the Army have gained a temporary stronghold and carried [? intimidation] to a fine art. Our well wishers have in consequence paid lip service to Rashid Ali. They seem completely disorganized and have been too frightened to come and see me. This complex must be removed and it can only be removed quickly I in a more normal atmosphere. I must have a quiet period during I which I can get in social touch with old friends and during ! which inevitable opposition to Rashid Ali will have a chance to grow. 2. For that reason I attach particular importance to immediate entry into informal relations with the Government. It will not affect our prestige to any extent and is generally expected. I do not recommend de jure recognition now, our policy, until the t? situation] again changes, should be I submit to keep Rashid Ali in play and at the same time be careful to do nothing which can be twisted into a threat against their sacred independence. 3. [?Here the] broadcast about landing troops has had exactly the effect which I hoped for. It has weakened Rashid Ali's position and while giving cause for compliant [sic:?compiLajnt] I hope will sow distrust in the minds of the extremists and the Axis. The more we dwell on his friendliness the more the people will be non-plussed and if by some freakish chance he is [grp. undec.] it will still be the right policy. 1. I regard this as a temporary phase but it is an important one. Ue have only won the first round by the safe landing of troops. Very shortly I think we must come to a [3 grps.undec.] seek [grp.undec.] with Rashid Ali [2 grps.undec.J postpone the clash as long as possible.

He volunteered information that one battalion was being withdrawn from Basra and assured me that the whole tone of the press would change from today. H e kept harning on the question of full recognition. He ascribed any impatient feeling of annoyance which might exist amongst certain officers in the Army to our failure to supply their requirements and assured me 'chat all would be' satisfied when we did so. He referred again.to the importance of rapid passage | of troops through Iraq, He stressed the extreme importance from the Arab point of view of some declaration by His Majesty's G-overnment regarding Palestine and Syria. In each of our conversations I have spoken with extreme frankness, I have told him that His'Majesty’s Government naturally wish to maintain cordial relations with any Government in power but that they have disliked his recent methods and greatly resented the hostile attitude of certain Iraqis and the extent to which enemy activities have been permitted. I have told him plainly that certain of his Ministers and Army Chiefs are suspected and that insults to members of R.A.F. in the last 3 weeks have caused extreme anger, I have expressed my desire to co-operace with him but there must be an entirely new basis and a new atmosphere. Instead of putting all blame on us the Iraqis must recognise their own shortcomings and prove by acts that they are really friendly. They must come out into the open and make ^known their policy to ever;/one. If that is done and His Majesty's Government become convinced of their good faith, no doubt benefits will follow in due course. I told him that / continued presses advisers [grp undec] especially with the opening of lines of communication could not fail to keep alive the distrust and asked him why relations with the Italians were not broken off. He replied ’ ve.: thatthat unfortunately whole of the nation was convinced that such- action would not be in the best interests of Iraq but that he was ready to render [three grp undec].

Feisal also asked whether Ibn Baud should telegraph congratulations to the new Regent. 2. I said that it seemed clear to me from the communication which I had made that Rashid Ali s regime was on probation. If the Government followed the principles laid down by Ibn Baud himself namely full co-operation with His Majesty’s Government and no contact with the Axis, His Majesty’s Government would probably recognize it. As regards congratulatory telegram to the new Regent, I felt it would be better if Ibn Baud awaited our lead as separate action might afford an opening for undesirable Axis comment. REC®. ROL. CtTPr.

This morning in his discussions with the Head of the Military Mission, the Chief of the General Staff informed him that orders &lt; had been given to the garrison at Basra not to oppose landing and to withdraw all troops and guns from the river except the normal garrison of one company and guns at Fao which would remain in their position. General Waterhouse was informed that the total of artillery at Basra was four 5.7 howitzers and four 18 pounder field guns. 3.

We are therefore hound [group undec.] hy this communication and in addition public opinion will expect and, I think, accept it. It is basis of all our explanations to Iraqis and a departure from it would be regarded with grave suspicion. I realize however that present force may be regarded as an advance guard for permanent protection of lines of communi cation and that [group undec.] impossible to effect actual passage of troops, except possibly a small token force, over lines of communication until further reinforcements arrive. From political point of view as I see it from here rapid [? opening] of lines of communication is very important. Basra is naturally of supreme importance to us strategically, but on the other hand in Iraqi eyes it is comparatively speaking of minor political importance, and though the arrival of troops should have an immediate and wholesome effect throughout the whole of Iraq, it will soon wear off if none of them are seen further north. Retention of large^force at Basra without opening of lines of communication will be quickly turned to our [? immense] disadvantage. If we are to establish our position more firmly and safequard our strategic and other interests throughout Iraq we must show the flag here* Bagdad is/ 2 . AV*'- f&lt; —&gt; .. is hub of Iraq* ^ It dominates country and is fountain head r of most anti-British and pro-Axis activities,. It is these* that we have to fight and the opening of lines of communi cation should immensely help us both here and in the districtso I therefore hope that no time will be lost in making a start. ^What I have in mind at present is the retention of a sufficiently strong -force at Basra to protect itself ? the strengthening, if it is thought necessary of Habbaniva and the passage of future reinforcements through to Palestine where they v/ould remain as a striking force if required,, I understand that the use of Palestine as a base has been policy of far Office until recent events necessitated direct despatch of troops to Basra, It would also have an excellent effect (though not on Rashid Ali or his gang) if depot in Bagdad v/ere occupied by British troops.

On the contrary this development has proved that any regime in Iraq is prepared to honour its obligations under the treaty with Great Britain and that this policy has the backing of the vast majority of the Iraqi people.” 3. ^ We must remember that any comment of ours indicaoing satisfaction with Rashid Ali must tend to rally the waverers to him and discourage our friends. It would therefore seem advisable to go slowly in any comment unless and until we have made up our minds that we must recognise Rashid Ali and accord him our support.

After consulting head of Military Mission I decided that in order to forestall direct enquiry from Rashid Ali concerning truth of these rumours (and also to set at. rest dangerous suspicions to which [?they would] give rise) it was necessary to notify Rashid Ali this evening. I met him at 6,15 p.m, and he was much gratified by the prospect of recognition* I explained circumstances of arrival ^ of troops in accordance with your instructions 0 Rashid Ali received news well, agreed that passage of troops was treaty right and promised all facilities in accordance with plans drawn up last summer* He undertook that local authorities at Basra should at once be informed accordingly* He agreed also to arrange for suitable publicity which would dispel public misgiv ings. I suggested that our own publicity organisations should put out nothing until we see what line he takes. He thought it important that the usual compliments should be exchanged by His Ma]esty ! s Shins and shore authorities as a demonstration of accord and goodwill tuid I hope that Naval Officer in Charge will agree to act accordingly* Here insert text of my immediately following telegram. 99999 Your telegram No, 283.L i^tl j [CYPrffiR] DEPARilIBI'jTj\L (SECRET) S FROM BAGDAD TO FOREIGN OFFICE. ^Sir K* Cornwallis i\[Oe 547 ICth 'April, 1941.

Angora No. 1, vvvvwv IMPORTANT . In reply to my communication Ibn Sauu has sent me a long message of which the following is the substance. 2. Ibn Saud strongly disapproves of action taken by Rashid Ali but is not altogether surprised as u Since Allah created them, Iraqians have always been like that”. His Majesty's Government know his, Ibn Baud’s, policy to struggle for friendly relations with Great Britain who alone can help the Arabs. 3. He had received at the same time as my communication a f message from Rashid Ali through the Saudi Arabian Charge d Affaires in Bagdad stating [gro.undec,] Ibn Saud's advice was alone of value and that he would accent only His Majesty's mediation between the Iraqis and the British. The King had replied Iraq should make every effort to reach agreement with His Majesty s Government, they should avoid disturbance and seditious acts calculated to harm their country and [grp.undec. ] enemy, and should have no dealings with the Governments and individuals who seek only their personal advantage to the detriment of Iraq's interests. 4. As regards recognition of the present regime in Iraq, Ibn Saud does not consider it is a matter of immediate \ practical importance to him as this is not a time when questions | between the two countries could be discussed, but he can assure , His Majesty s Government that even if there were no disagreement between Iraq- and His Majesty’s Government in the matter he would take no action which would encourage present Government in Iraq |to believe that he approved of the situation which he regards as prejudicial to the interests of his friends the British. 5. Ibn Baud’s message is satisfactory in that it contains condemnation of Rashid Ali's actions and assurance that he will afford no support of the present regime, but it gives no indication that the King intends to instruct his^representative at Bagdad not to recognise the present regime as the constitutioml Government of Irac. 6. I have thought best to await your further instructions before pressing Ibn Saud to express more clearly and openly his view of the legality of Rashid~Ali’s coup and have merely thanked His Majesty for his assurances and for his renewed expressions of friendship. \4,.

Although Ibn Saud had, as you will have seen, already addressed Rashid Ali on lines indicated by you, I sent a further message asking him, in view of the recent developments, to write once again in stronp: terms to Rashid Ali. 3. As regards recognition, the Kaimakam, through whom I communicated my message to Ibn Saud, explained the King’s attitude as follows: His Majesty did not wish to take action which could only result in a personal breach with R. He had, he felt, considerable influence with Rashid Ali, but if he followed His Majesty’s Government’s suggestion and openly declared that he regarded his Government as unconstitutional, Rashid All would take it as a personal affront and could no longer be expected to listen to his advice. Ibn Saud had shown that he shared His Majesty’s Government’s views and that he condemned Rashid Ali*s action, but he felt strongly that British interests could at present be served if he avoided an open breach. | 4. In view of the Kaimakam*s statement which I have no doubt was inspired by Ibn Saud himself, and pending your instructions, I thought it useless to press Ibn Saud in the matter.r 'A [CYPHER] DISTRIBUTION B.

He has publicly announced his intention of fulfilling Iraqi obligations under the 'Treaty and has made all sorts of specious promises if only we will give him our support. However we know beyond all doubt that he has long been in touch with the Axis Powers and that he is determined to pursue a policy directed against the Anglo-Iraqi Alliance. We are also convinced that he would be really dangerous once he was firmly in the saddle, which at present he is not. Unwelcome as this development is, His Majesty's Government have therefore come to the conclusion that it is impossible to have any confidence in him and his assurances, and that we must base our attitude tov/ards him on the known fact of his complete ! unreliability. I 2. Please inform the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs accordingly in strict confidence, after thanking him for the offer of his good services. You should go on to say that one of our main considerations is to secure the safety of the Turkish line of communications through Basra and that in view of the great attention which is always paid in Iraq to the attitude of the Turkish Government we aftach special value to their cooperation with us. What we would recommend is that they should in all their dealings with the present Iraqi regime shew complete scepticism of any friendly assurances, exnress grave anxiety both at the illegal developments in Iraq and at the dangerous strain on Anglo-Iraqi relations, make clear their complete solidarity with us and generally keep the Iraqis guessine: S-s to their intentions. 3. You should of course impress on him that relationship of Iraqi Minister at Angora with Rashid All makes snecial caution in dealing with him essential. in particular we do not repeat not think it desirable that Rashid Ali should receive any indication yet whether we are or are not prepared to treat with him, still less any light on the steps which wo may have to take in the circumstances which nave arisen. * m*:*.

[of 10th April: forthcoming uldUi^r^ ° f lroors t01 ™ 1) - The main^reason for sending troops to Iraq is the importance which is attached here to the future use of Basra for^military purposes,, Military authorities consider it essential that we should not be deprived of all possibility of establishing a depbt there if in their opinion war developments necessitate this, 7/e realise probability that there will be some degree of opposition, and that our line of communications between Basra and Bagdad may be closed to us, at least temporarily. 2. it is appreciated that contemplated action is not entirely covered by our Treaty rights. Our rights are to use lines of communication through Iraq, and also to send reinforcements to Basra aerodrome in an emergency, but only after consultation with the Iraqi Government. Although this is undoubtedly an emergency, we cannot presumably obtain prior consent of the Iraqi Government, and there is indeed no Iraqi Government which we recognise. Best line of justification seems to be that recent developments in Iraq demonstrate grave danger lest, as a result of direct or indirect Axis influence, our line of communications through Iraq and our Treaty position generally should be imperilled, and we are therefore obliged to take prompt and effective steps to meet this unexpected emergency. 3. Do you think that the arrival of British troops in Iraq should be made the occasion for a proclamation in favour of the Regent's rights? If there were a really strong movement in Iraq itself in favour of the Regent, there'would be much to be said in favour of lending it any support we can. But even if this were the case, it seems doubtful whether a proclamation at that particular moment would really be the wisest step in the interests of His Royal Highness himself. 4./ POL SI P*f. 1 i APR 94f INDIA OFFICE4. As regards the attitude which you should at present adopt towards Rashid Ali and his friends, our main object must be to try to reduce possibility of effective opposition to . / landing of troops.

Personality of the Regent is too colourless to impress itself deeply on the country and it is becoming more evident that any difficulty which may grow against Rashid will be due to embryo enmities and from consequence of a crusade to restore the Regent, Intervention on his behalf is, therefore, now too 1 ate. 2. After Rashid Ali’s speech in Parliament yesterday (see my telegram No * 512) any justification for immediate intervention on the protection of our treaty rights would logically seem to have disappeared. By this manoeuvre Rashid Ali has placed himself in a favourable position to represent any forceful action on our part as an attack aimed against the independence of the country and it is quite likely that he could rouse such a fanatical and unreasoning people against us. It is, therefore, important that when we take such action it should be as a consequence of his refusal to implement treaty in some important respect. We must have a clear cut issue with which to justify ourselves to the Iraqi nation if we are to avoid large scale operations.. 3. I understand from your telegram No 0 256 tha t His Majesty's Government have no intention of recognising de facto Governmento By refusing Rashid Ali recognition we will test the sincerity of his protestations. He may show his true colours and denounce the treaty, in which case we will have a clear right to act. On the other hand he may be reasonably friendly for a time in the hope of ultimate recognition. We would then have a respite, of which advantage might be taken. Opening of lines of communication will obviously be a test case and if His Majesty’s Government decide to adopt a force ful policy, it seems to be most suitable and necessary^issue to raise. Whether it should precede or follow evacuation of British women and children is a matter for consideration. 4. As you are aware, I favour a strong policy but^ ) rapidity of events has deprived us of our first opportunity. Rashid Ali’s speech in Parliament has changed the situation from a local point of view and until all our plans are made I deprecate any premature action of which he may take ad vantage to alienate latent sympathy towards us which still exists. At the moment his game, for some reason, is not to antagonise us and until he changes his attitude there appears to be no immediate danger of violent action.[Cypher], DISTRIBUTION B FROM EimJ) TO FO RE IGN OFFICE, 3ir K* Cornwallis. x &lt;lo. 315.

With the deposition of the Regent hy Parliament and in the absence of any signs of a popular movement in his support, there seems to be no object in his remaining at Basra. I therefore suggest that it would be best to explain [grp, undec. ?situation] to him and to offer him and his companions asylum until we are in a position to bring about his restoration. I suggest that his destination might be Cairo or India. It may be necessary to provide him and his companions with funds.

The Regent's chances of organising an effective resistance in the immediate future ha-we disappeared. He is isolated at Basra and has no supporters in the country v/ho are hold enough to come into the open on his behalf. Strong latent *discontent* and considerable public *sympathy* no doubt exist but new regime is in complete control of the country and probably considerable time must pass before active opposition to it can be organised. Nothing short of armed intervention on our part can hurt Rashid Ali at present and his propaganda in general is so strong that if it is decided to use force, we shall have to take careful precautions to ensure that our action is not resented by the people. Last week most of them would have welcomed it. The general deterioration has been so rapid that I do not think that general adoption of second course *mentioned in my telegram No. 281* can do much more for the moment than encourage the spirit of non-cooperation with Rashid Ali among the Regent's supporters though [? it would] be extremely embarrassing to him in the long run. Air demonstrations by themselves would not be sufficient to turn the scale and I do not advise them unless the situation changes. Opinions vary as to probable effect on Rashid Ali of adoption of this policy. I see no reason to change the opinion expressed in my telegram No. 281 but the actions of a gang of unscrupulous ruffians cannot be treated with certainty and there is always the possibility that they will resort to violent coercion. From above information, it will be seen that unless we use force we shall have, a long *uphill task in regaining our lost influence and in eradicating that of Germans. Failing force and provided that I am [? in] time however, I am not at all/all hopeless of success* I am still of the opinion expressed in my telegram No. 291 regarding value of Rashid Ali’s proposals and think that if it is decided to negotiate with him, it should he without any illusions and purely as a matter of unfortunate expediency in order to gain time.

Rashid Ali has made the following proposals to adviser to Ministry of Interior for communication to me:~ (1) Regent to accept Taha’s resignation and entrust Rashid Ali with formation of new Cabinet. Cabinet will_at once sanction four months’ absence from the country (maximum allowed by Constitution) for Regent, Sharif Sharaf to act_ during his absence (this is alternative to present intention of calling Parliament to appoint Sharif Sharaf as Regent on • grounds that [grp. undec 3 ] has left his post). (2) Rashid Ali undertakes (a) to broadcast at once and at intervals in future countering German propaganda that his Administration is pro-Axis, (b) to implement spirit of alliance on wider basis than heretofore, (c) that there shall be no agitation for implementation of White Paper before the t end of the war or action afterwards in favour of His Majesty's Government, (d) to give Advisers large measure of supervision over propaganda and passports of Palestinians, &lt; v e) to prepare opinion for a rupture with Italy which he now professes to consider desirable. 2 . I do not know whether in making attempt to legitimise his position Rashid Ali has been actuated by uneasiness regarding his own position, or whether he has received German orders to go slowly for the present,, I cannot credit him with a real change of heart or place the slightest reliance on any of his promises. Even if he were sincere, I doubt whether the army and other extremists would allow him to make such a volte face. I also doubt whether the Regent would even consider the proposal. The only possible advantages of its adoption which I can ^e^are that we would probably ensure safety for British community for a +ime and might (though', this is problematical) have a breathing &gt; space during which we might regain some ground. We could, in fact, nut off the evil day for a while. On the other hand, we would be in the painful nosition of sponsoring a proposal which we nnow would be intensely repugnant to the Regent REC».

It contains correspondence and memoranda regarding relations between HM Government (HMG) and the Government of Iraq, and documents the reaction of the India Office and Foreign Office to political developments within Iraq. The file opens with descriptions of the situation following the coup d'état of Rashid Ali al-Gaylani, and documents the build-up to the Anglo-Iraqi War (2-31 May 1941), including the arrival of British and Indian troops in Basra (under rights granted in the Anglo-Iraq Treaty of 1930), arrangements to evacuate the Regent 'Abd al-Illah, British attempts to shore up support from the Turkish and Egyptian authorities, and Axis propaganda in Iraq. The papers then contain communications regarding the progress of the war, including reports on troop movements, the dispatch of war materials, the actions of Germany, Italy, France and Turkey, and Indian public opinion regarding the conflict. These papers consist of dispatches sent by the British Ambassador to Iraq (Sir Kinahan Cornwallis) to the Foreign Office, as well as numerous copy communications between the Senior Naval Officer in the Persian Gulf, the Commander in Chief of the East Indies Section, the Political Agent Kuwait, the Viceroy of India, and HM Ambassador to the United States.From the end of the war the file consists primarily of dispatches from Cornwallis to the Foreign Office, reporting on the return of the Regent, the pogrom against the Jewish community, the breaking of diplomatic relations with Vichy France and Japan, the trial of the coup supporters, the Iraqi declaration of war against Germany, Italy and Japan, the possibility of Iraqi membership of the United Nations, and the release of political prisoners from the Ammara [̔Amāra] concentration camp. The regular dispatches also contain details of various cabinet crises, and details of the domestic economic and military situation. The file contains a small amount of material for the years 1944-1946, including annual reports submitted by Cornwallis and his successor, Sir Hugh Stonehewer-Bird.The file includes dividers which give lists of correspondence references found in the file by year. These are placed at the end of the correspondence (folios 2-4).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Rashīd ʿAlī al-Gaylānī</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>Government</topic></subject><subject><topic>Politics</topic></subject><subject><topic>Coup d'états</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Iraq</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Second World War (1939-1945)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Anglo-Iraqi War (1941)</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000602.0x000195#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
