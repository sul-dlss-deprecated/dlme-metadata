The Director-General understands that Major Catley is willing to return to the Iraqi Railways as a civilian if he can be released from his military duties. 4. As it is most important from many points of view to keep the Iraqi Railways running efficiently we should be grateful if you would kindly approach the authorities concerned with a view to them permitting Major Catley to accept a new contract as Assistant Engineer in the Iraqi Railways. 5. If they are willing to do so Major Catley should be asked to settle the details of his employment directly with the Director-General.Tne buaan iiovernment is prepared to agree that Mr. John Smith, Conservator of Forests, should be made available for service with the Iraqi Government for a period of two months subject to the following conditions (a) In order to prevent valuable time being lost the Iraqi Government should pay the cost of air passages to and from Bagdad. (b) The Iraqi Government should ensure that Mr. Smith is not put to any expense on account of transport or equipment (including camp kit, tent, kitchen etc.) necessary for the work. As it will be necessary for Mr. Smith to fly to Bagdad he will be unable to bring such equipment with him. 2. As Mr. J. Smith will be on leave from the Sudan, and will be receiving his normal pay, the Sudan Government will not require payment of any salary to Mr, Smith, but would raise no objection to his accepting any honorarium which the Iraqi Government might think fit to pay him. 3. Mr. Smith can leave Khartoum between October 20th and 30th if the Iraqi accepts the conditions given above. 4.

Retiring official although secretary plus chief auditor has in fact been carrying on duties of deputy Director General but it is important for the Railways to obtain the services of an experienced technical railway official to replace him. Hence the proposed change in designation. 2. Board have also agreed to the setting up of an independent audit department under a senior auditor who would be an experienced Iraqi Railway official. 3. 4s the post of chief auditor should, under the terms of agreement attached to the 1936 Railways Agreement, be held by a British subject until March 1946, I should be glad to learn 1, whether you agree to the Railways' proposal. I hope you will agree since: (a) Deputy Director General is a new appointment. Number of British officials will therefore not be reduced. In any case the present chief auditor has agreed to stay on until suitable Deputy Director General is found; (b) Board have recently also approved appointment of a British architect 4.

I enclose a copy of a Saving telegram just received from Bagdad, from which you will see that for various reasons the Ambassador does not think that it would be advisable to raise this question at the moment. In view of the considerations mentioned by Cornwallis, we also feel that it would be better to allow the matter to remain in abeyance. You will note that Chatley is in fact receiving every facility; and if the present arrangement should prove unsatisfactory in practice the proposal that the Engineer-in-Chief should be formally appointed as consultant could always be reconsidered at a later stage. In the meantime we feel that we should defer to the Ambassador’s opinion that it would be imprudent to raise this matter with the Iraqis at present.

In their discussions with late Port Directop Admiralty proposed that qualified Civil Engineer with training in river work should be appointed to advise him in the development ot the dredging operations. Chief duty would further scientific study and research of the problems involved in the maintenance of the channels in the estuary which are liable to constant change. ~ Appointment would be additional to the present dredging organisation which would remain under a Dredging Superintendent responsible for the day to day details of the management of the dredgers. 2. Ward agreed and was sure that he could get sanction of the Iraqi Covemment for the appointment. Ha mentioned # salary terms aggregating £l-,500 per annum plus cost ol living allowance of £96 per annum. &gt; Appointment should be lor at least one year in the first instance. Admiralty attach highest importance to this appointment in connexion with the maintenance of the channel and are prepared to release Mr. Coutts B. Sc. A.M.i.L.ri* who is well qualified for the post. He served for 16 years with the Department of Railways and Canals and National Harbour Board in Canada and is 50. 4. In addition Admiralty wish as soon as new Port Director arrives to send out to Basra on a short visit member of Civil Engineer in Chiefs staff. Dr. Chatley. ne is an expert in drag suction dredgers, took part in all the discussions with 'Ward, and could inform Port Director of tho results and Admiralty views on most profitable method ox dredging* He would go as employee of the.Admiralty and no financial liability would fall on the Iraqi Government. 5. If essential for success of his mission, he c^uld be given temporary Naval rank, but Admiralty do not wish to do this unless you think it necessary. 6 . Both these proposals are urgent and Admiralty do not wish them to be held up pending appointment of new Port Director. Please therefore secure concurrence of Iraqi Government as soon as possible. 7. Finally you should know that Admiralty think it Lly yOvx ~., m ■■ „ desirable that Civil Engineer in Chief should be used as consultant for the duration of the war.

' I told Minister for Foreign Affairs that we were finding it difficult to recruit C.I.D. police, and enquired how urgent and important appointment was. Minister for Foreign Affairs thought that they could manage very well with Major Wilkins until his contract ended in May 1941, and mentioned the value of local experience in this work. In this connexion he recalled the good work done by Major F. W. Gerard of the Indian Police who was appointed Deputy Commissioner of Police at Basra m June 1920. He said Major Gerard had returned to India in 1922, and that if he would return here for a few years the authorities would welcome him. I should be grateful if you v/ould trace Major Gerard in the hope of recruiting him. CuitUjL44 ' ~ Repeated to Government of India telegram No. 88 . ( ***ray.) IWk CctK * bn.(^R) 7b /w /f C cJhya^^ ^ Z^ 4 ' ^ /x^ I attach our papers^with the Government of 7 ' India’s telegrams flagged at P.Z.4780 and P.Z.6200. The Government of India’s answer has been that they regret their inability to find a C.I.D. expert for Iraq but they are short of officers for their own purposes. There can, however, be no question as to the importance of effecting an improvement in the situation in Iraq and we can have another try with the Government of India on that ground. Sir Alexander Cadogan asks that we should take the matter up on a personal basis and I suggest a private telegram to the Viceroy accordingly. 7/.vhw BtC (S) 7« Foreigrn Office, S.W.l. 5th Decemher, 1940. f In June last the Iraqi Government asked for our assistance in recruiting an expert in criminal investigation, with special knowledge of intelligence work, for a period of tv/o years at a maximum salary of £150 per month. On the 24th June we wrote officially to the India Office, and also to the Colonial Office and Home Office (the reference number of our letter wasJ 2 2158 / 2158 / 93 ), enquiring whether anyone suitable for 15e“'Din could be found. Unfortunately, however, the Government of India were unable to meet this request (see their telegram 4459, of the 13th JJovember, addressed to the Ambassador at Bagdad and repeated to the India Office) and the only candidate suggested to us by the other departments concerned was unable to accept nomination. The Iraqi Government are now pressing for a reply. As you doubtless know, the Iraqi Government are under a treaty obligation to endeavour in the first place to recruit British subjects whenever they require the services of foreign officials, and it is obviously up to us to do our best to supply suitable candidates in all cases. Quite apart from that, I should, however, explain that there is a great deal going on under the surface in Iraq which causes us all the greatest anxiety. This request by the Iraqi Government for a criminal investigation expert seems to us a heaven-sent opportunity to put in some really reliable and competent man to keep an eye on things, and I should view with dismay any failure on our part to avail ourselves of it. Jhis is / a Sir Stuart Brown, K.C.I.E., C.B.a matter on which Lord Lloyd too, feels very strongly. It may also he assumed that the Service Departments, who have recently shown considerable anxiety about the situation in Iraq., would support our desire to take full advantage of the present opportunity. As the result of a letter which I wrote to Maxwell on the subject, the Home Office have very kindly now made renewed enquiries and have discussed the position with us orally. It seems that they can give us, and have in fact given us, the names of certain possible candidates who might be capable of taking on the job, if they were willing to go, and if they could be spared from the work on which they are at present engaged. At the same time, the Home Office admit that it is very doubtful whether any of the names on their list, mostly retired officers of the Government of India, would really be the best men for the post. It was agreed, as the result of our talk, that the ideal solution would be for the Government of India to second a really first-class service officer, say forty to forty-five years old, with recent experience of work among Moslems. Although I fully realise how reluctant the Government of India must be in present circumstances to spare anyone doing this sort of job, I should be most grateful if you would consider taking the matter up with them on a personal basis and asking them to consider the Iraqi Government* request anew, not from the point ofview of their willingness to oblige the Iraqi Government, but as a request v/hich it is really important in our own interests that we should meet. It would be a valuable piece of v/ar-work for which we think a really good man should, if necessary, be seconded. As I have said, the appointment is for two years, but if the war came to an end before that time, we should not / raise71 (g&gt; raise any objection to the selected candidate retiring. If you see no objection perhaps you would be good enough to telegraph to the Government of India in the matter and emphasize the really vital necessity in the national interest of releasing someone for this work and arranging for him to proceed to Iraq at the earliest possible moment.plotted to Pol.

J. p. Qinqp\nde* £D Desire of the Iraqi Government to engage two experts for the purpose of carrying out a compre hensive survey of Iraq r s mineral resources Please refer to your demi-official letter to Mr. Caroe No. P.Z.7193/39, dated the 17th November 1939. 2. I am desired to say that Dr. Heron has been asked if he would like the senior of the two posts. He has replied that he is ready to accept it, but has requested that his salary should be Rs. 3,000/- per month or thereabouts. This seems reasonable as this was his pay when he was under the Government of India, and is what he is now drawing from the Government of His Exalted Highness the Nizam of Hyderabad. As, however, he is drawing a pension, he might be willing to accept less than Rs*3,000/- a month, provided the period of employment is for two years or more. He agrees to the provisions of the form of contract and is content to leave its duration for decision between the Foreign Office and the Government of Iraq. 3. As regards an appointment to the second post, Dr. Heron considers that for the first year^only one officer, the senior, is necessary. He could tour the country extensively, gain a general ide : he geology and the conditions of work • • • •in consultat orities in Iraq, work, and then, formulate a concrete scheme for the survey. We agree with Dr. Heron B s view and think that it would be better to defer engaging an Assistant until the possibilities of mineral development have been gauged and the requirements of the country have been ascertained. 4. The Government of India would be glad to be informed whether the Iraq Government are desirous of engaging Dr. Heron and, if so, on what pay, and for what period. They would also be glad to know when, and to whom, he should report in the event of his accepting the terms offered by the Iraq Government* R.T.Peel, Esquire, C.B.E., M.C., India Office, London1% 124 (3 7257/5725/93). J.P. Gibson, Esq My dear Gibson, I enclose a copy of a despatch from the Ambassador at Bagdad about the wish of the Iraqi Government to recruit two experts to carry out a comprehensive survey of Iraq’s mineral resources. On receipt of this despatch we wrote to Starling of the Mines Department and asked if he could suggest any suitable candidates for these appointments or, failing that, if he would consider approaching any sources from which they thought that candidates might be forthcoming. We also got in touch with Lloyd of the Colonial Office. Starling has now told us that he has discussed the question with his technical adviser who has had a good deal of experience in the East, His adviser feels that experience of eastern conditions is almost a sine qua non for the job in question and he suggests therefore that loy far the most likelv f i which to recruit at least the RECd. POL. OEPt ) yNOv1939 INDfA OFFFCE /senioriiiafirr-tH i ...... Utf Jsenior* of the two experts required is the Geological Survey of India, In particular he mentioned the name of Dr. Heron, who was formerly director of the Indian Geological Survey hut who has apparently now retired and is still in India doing private consulting work. Starling suggested that we should ask you to find out whether Dr. Heron or some other ex-officer of the Indian Geological Survey of suitable standing is available. We should be most grateful if you could make enquiries on the subject through the Government of India. You already know of the importance which we attach to finding strong candidates for all appointments under the Iraqi Government and the v/ar has also added to the difficulty of filling such vacancies. In the present case, as you will see from Newton’s desoatch, the terms under which these officials are to serve have not yet been formulated. The Iraqis propose that it should be left to the experts eventually selected to suggest the period in which they consider they could complete their work. At the same time nothing has been said about salary, except that it would be adequate.We feel, however, that it will 'be difficult to recruit anyone unless there is at least an agreed minimum period of employment, which could, of course, 'be extended later 'by mutual consent. I may say that the Iraqis are usually reluctant to give contracts for a longer period than three years in the first place and that Starling has expressed the opinion that a three years contract would be reasonable. We also asked Starling for his views on the question of salary. We pointed out that it might be a good thing, as there were two appointments to be filled, to have a senior man for one of them at a higher salary and to make the other one his assistant. It was felt, however, that the feasibility of this would no doubt depend on whether tv/o men could be found to cover more or less the v/hole field of investigation desired by the Iraqis. Starling's opinion was that it would probably be necessary to offer something like 2,000 rupees a month as a minimum, and he suggested that, as regards a junior officer, perhaps the right course would be to ask the senior officer to select his own assistant.We would “be more than grateful if the Government of India could sound Dr. Heron or any one else whom they regard as suitable and find out whether he would he prepared to consider this post, and, if so what salary he would expect to receive. I enclose three copies of the standard form of contract for foreign officials in Iran under which the experts are almost certain to he engaged.(!1 127 Copy. i i i r . 7193 | (S 725V5725/93).

Their idea is to employ two at the beginning and more later if necessary. 2. They have not suggested the period for which contracts would be offered as they prefer to leave it to the experts to suggest the term in which they could complete the required work. The Minister for Foreign Affairs made it clear, however, the remuneration on an adequate scale would be offered to men who had the requisite expert knowledge and experience. 3. For want of technical knowledge, the Ministers are unable to give me any further details of the survey which they wish to have made, but they have explained that they wish to establish a basic and complete record of the /geology The Right Honourable The Viscount Halifax, K.G., G.C.S.I., G.C.I.E., etc., etc., etc.geology of Iraq’s surface, so that plans may he evolved for the development of her mineral resources (including earths, sands, gravels, etc.).

IKDIA OFFICE Many thanks for'your letter P.Z.4481/39 of the 24th July, about the recruitment of British judges for service in Iraq. 2. I feel that the time has come to let you have a statement of the position in this matter, on which we have given you so much trouble. As you know, we have been in touch with the Colonial Office as well as with yourselves about the possibility of filling one or both of the vacant posts by secondment. The Colonial Office have drawn a blank in Palestine, but are still making enquiries elsewhere. He have informed the i^mbassy at Bagdad accordingly. 3. We have also told them that the Madras Government have put forward the names of two Indian Civil Service officers who would do very well for the appointments in question but that both of them are already earning more than the salary offered by the RECd. POL. DEPt. | I rAUG 1939 INDIA QFFir.F Iraqi/Iraqi Government and obviously cannot toe expected to go to Iraq unless the terms of service are improved. We have therefore explained to the Embassy that it very much looks as though it is simply not possible for us to find suitable candidates on a three-year contract unless the Iraqi Government improve on the existing terms. We do not, of course, know for certain how the Iraqis would view any suggestion that the salary to be paid should be increased, but in view of the relative unimportance of the two vacant posts, we fear that they are not at all likely to be attracted by the idea. 4, However, we have asked the Embassy for their views on the whole question including (a) the possibility of asking the Iraqis to improve on the terms of service hitherto offered and (b) the possibility of leaving the two posts vacant. (This last solution, however, involves various complications with the League of Nations with which I need not trouble you.) When we get their reply, we shall probably have to ask them to talk the matter over with the Iraqis. 5. I am afraid all this means that it will be some time still before you will be able to send a definite reply/00 JJ reply to the Government of Madras about their very helpful offer. I hope that this will not involve them in too much inconvenience. We shall, of course, write further as soon as possible. Yours sincerely,F0iU2»XCiK OirFi'Jcij ^ •” •J-.

But what stands in the way of either of them beinp 1 considered for the appointment is the salary of the temporary post of Judge in Iraq, which it is presumed will be £ 112-10-0 per mensem (equivalent to Rs. 1500) throu^out the period of appointment. J.E. Laher, I.C,S., completed his judicial trailing in July 1938 and has acted as District and Sessions Juo.ge for about 6 months. Ee is now on leave till 23rd June 1939. He has put in 10 years 1 an^ 6 months* service and is now in receipt of a salary of Rs. 1350/- plus £ 25/-, which will rise as follows in the next three years:- Rs. 1425 plus £ 30 from 1st November 1939 Rs. 1500 plus £ 30 from 1st November 1940 Rs. 1600 plus £ 30 from 1st November 1941 Rs. 1700 plus £ 30 from 1st November 1942. 7.7. G-eorgeson, I.C.S., is now undergoing judicial training, which will be over on 2nd July 1939. He has put in 8 years* ana 6 months* service. His salary in the senior time scale of the I.C.S., will rise as follow's during the next three years:- Rs. 1275 plus £ 25 from 1st November 1939 Rs* 1350 plus £ 25 from 1st November 1940 Rs. 1425 plus £ 30 from 1st November 1941 Rs. 1500 plus £ 30 from 1st November 1942. (He is not likely to be appointed to act as District ana Sessions Judge for some time for want of a vacancy). It will not therefore be advantageous for either of them to accept the appointment on the terms now offered. If however the officer • • • •officer selected could be allowed to draw his pay in the regular line, and a suitable deputation allowance while employed as Juoee in Irag. both the officers mentioned above will be consulted whether they are willing to accept the appointment in the event of its bein^ offered to them.Dear Peel, Many thanks for your letter p.z. 2595/39 ol the 9th June about the selection of a successor to Sir John Ward as Director-General of the Iraqi Railways.

My dear Mowbray, Reference youi - confidential D.O. No. PZ2622/39 dated 10th May 1939. I quite realise the importance of the post of Director General of the Iraqui Railways and will do my best to help even though it may mean a certain amount of inconven ience to ourselves. I shall, of course, approach no one till I hear further from you. 2. Generally speaking, I think it would be difficult to get a really good serving officer, who has prospects ahead of him in this country, to accept a short term contract with the Iraqui Government unless it can be arranged to allow him to retain a lien on his job in India. I do not think there would be a great deal of difficulty for the first period of three years. If, however, the officer decided to accept a further term of office, he might be required to sever his connection with Indian Railways. He would then have to assess the advantages or disadvantages of doing this. 3. I think you will agree with me that before it would be fair to approach any particular officer, I would require to have further details of the terms on which he would join the Iraqui Railways. The terms I am thinking of are pay, leave admissible and allowances payable, cost of house accommodation, whether income tax is payable or not, and at what rates. 4. I think there would be considerably less difficulty in getting an officer near the end of his service, or one who has just retire^, than a young man round the age of 40, as has been suggested by Mount. I shall now endeavour to tell you what I know about the officers suggested by yourself and Mount. I shall take Mount's list as this includes all those suggestedHe is a L.H, Kirkness. C.I,E.. D&gt;S.Q.. Q.B.E&gt;, V.D. first-class man with a splendid war record. He could hold down the charge, but he is 58 on 17th November this year; has settled down at home, and I question if he would desire to uproot himself again. J. C. Higher. F.C.H. Has just retired from the post of Member of the Railway Board; has brains, but is now lethargic; has not, 1 think, the energy necessary for a post of this description. He would not, in my opinion, be a success. A.F. Harvey, F.C.H. Has just retired from the post of General Manager, Eastern Bengal Railway. Has been in indifferent health for the past two years; has heart. I feel quite certain that his health would not stand it also that he would not accept the offer. J.a. Bell. On leave preparatory to retirement from the post of (General Manager, East Indian Railway. Has great ability, but I rather question his tact. He also is not a fit man. He has, I believe, a certain amount of money. I do not think he would take the post, if offered. Lt.-Qol. R.E. Gordon. M.C.. R.E. Not to my mind suitable. He is quite an able officer in his own way, but lacks tact and is apt to hunt hares. One of the ‘'hares' that he has been hunting is causing us a considerable amount of trouble at the moment. Colonel H»L. Woodhouse, M.C., R.E. To my mind not a particularly outstanding officer. He is now on leave preparatory to retirement. Before this was Director of Civil Engineering with the Railway Board for just over three years, so I was in a position to see a good deal of his work and I do not recommend him.I ^6* f ( i’ Col onel J«P»S. Crreig* I have no knowledge of this officer, so cannot offer an opinion. Major J.E. Clutterbuck. I agree with Mount that he is a first- class officer, but so far he has only been employed on construction and maintenance and has had no administra tive experience. Except for this I think he v/ould have been a good choice. He is young and before he could take on the post he v/ould require some guarantee that he had a lien on his post in Indian Railways. This could, I think, be arranged. The question of v/hether he could continue in the Army v/ould require the approval, presumably, of the War Office. Lt.-Col. R.D. Waghorn, R&gt;E. Was at one time in the North Western Railway but reverted to military duty some years ago. I have no personal knowledge of him, but from enquiries I have made he would appear to be quite a good average officer. Ma jor C.A. Langlev. R.E. Was at one time in the G-.I.F. Railway but reverted to military duty a few years ago. Has a quiet, pleasing personality, and did well when he was with the G.I.P. I should say he was tactful, though I have only met him once or twice. A.G-. Hall. Grood, hard working, average officer, but so far has had no administrative experience, and though good, I am rather doubtful whether he would quite fill the bill. 5. Here are a few further suggestions S.L. Manley. Recently retired from the Eastern Bengal Railway as Chief Engineer. Age 53. He has also been Deputy Agent and twice officiated as Agent. First-class man; « was in Mesopotamia during the War for about two years.

Yours Rob. Mowbray, Rsq., India Office, LONDON.&lt; My dear Peel, Many thanks for your letter P.Z. 2205/39 of the 19th April about the post of Financial Adviser to the Iraqi Government, As regards Sir Robert Bell, we agree that his age is not necessarily a final bar and we have written to ask the Embassy at Bagdad what their views are. Subject to what they say, hov/ever, we feel that it would on the whole be better if we could find someone younger, and we think therefore that he should not be approached anyway at this stage. On the other hand Mr. A.F.L. Brayne sounds a very suitable man and we should be most grateful if you could sound him with a view to finding out whether he would allow his name to be considered for the appointment. I am sending a copy of this letter to Waley at the Treasury. RECd. pePT. INDIA OFFICE. R.T. Peel, Esq., M.C4 , Draft Paper. Department. Sir Guthrie Russell, K.C.I.E., Chief Commissioner of Railways, Simla. 10 MAY 1959 Confidential. My dear Russell, We have been asked whether we can suggest any successor to Sir John as Ward^^3Sce Director-General of the Iraqifc Railways. The exact terms of service are not known, but it seems safe to assume that the salary offered will be in the neighbourhood of £2,500, and that the contract will be for three years in the first instance, and might be renewed for a further period if the man chosen were a success. The age mentioned was 50 or not much more, and it would, of course, be essential that the officer selected should possess tact and patience to enable him to v/ork harmoniously with his Iraqi colleagues and chiefs. When I was first asked to advise, I suggested the following names in the order of preference indicated:- Ok^Qtfv^s') \/ A.P. Harvey J.A. Bell J.C. Highet and also ventured the opinion that the salary contemplated might be insufficiently attractive to serving officers of 50 or younger holding or having expectations of the higher2 — administrative appointments on the Indian Railways. Colonel Mount, who was also asked to advise, has suggested the following names 55 or older. 50-55. Under 50 . - L.H.Kirkness J.A.Bell Major J.E.Clutterbuck J.C.Highet Lt.Col. Lt.Col. R.D.Waghorn A.P.Harvey R.E.Gordon Major C.A.Langley. Col.H.L. A.G.Hall. Woodhouse GOl.J.P.S. Greig. It will he noticed that the above list includes all the names originally suggested by me. Mount also thought that it would be particularly valuable to have the opinion of Sir James Pitkelhly, who is said to know Iraq very well, and might also be able to suggest further names. The Foreign Office now seem to think that it would be definitely preferable to select someone younger than 55 ( if a suitable man can be found who would accept the post; aftd it would no doubt be easier to secure the services of a retired officer or of one who is about to retire. Mount, hov/ever, thinks that in the present circumstances it is highly desirable to get an energetic man still in the forties for the job, and strongly recommends Major Clutterbuck, of whom he formed theni Department. highest opinion. If Clutterbuck were disposed to take up the post, but unwilling to retire from the Corps, would it be possible to arrange for him to be seconded for a period of three years in the first place 1 . It is fully realised here that requests to spare a highly efficient officer may be very inconvenient to the Government of India, but it is urged by the Foreign Office that the post to be filled is a key one, since communications through Iraq may at any time become of vital strategic importance. We shall be very grateful if you can help in the matter. The Foreign Office suggest that until they have considered your views, no approach should be made to any of the officers whose names are under ceaaide ra t ion. Yours sincerely,I^Zj p. &amp;rn O (iLm Ctm \ Q '•&lt; 9 * -w • y -.y ' FOREIGN OFFICE, S,V.l* 25th April, 1939. -*fc p u: IJl irf Will you please refer to your letter p # 2 . 1861/39 of the 1st April to Baxter about the selection of a successor to Sir John Ward as Director General of the Iraqi Railways. 2. Waley has now passed on to us letters from Sir L. Browett of the Ministry of Transport giving the names of certain other possible candidates for the post who have been suggested by Colonel Mount, the Chief Inspector of Railways at the Ministry. Grouped for convenience in classes according to their age, the various candidates from India so far mentioned to us are as follows:- 55 or older Mr. L.H.Kirkness Mr. J.C.Highet Mr. A.F.Harvey R.T.Peel, Esq., M.C.

Under 50 Major J«E.Clutterbuck Lieutenant Colonel R.D.Waghorn Major G.A.Langley Mr. A.G.Hall Mount is of the opinion that the Government of India snould be consulted and he suggests that it would be particularly valuable to have the opinion James Litkeathly, as he Knows Irac[ very well. He may be able to suggest further names. Our feeling here is that it would definitely u . be preferable to select someone younger than 55, if a suitable man can be found who would accept the post. It would no doubt be easier to secure the services of someone who has already retired on pension, or is on the point of doing so. I should, however, say that in Mount*s view it would in present circumstances be highly desirable to get an energetic man in the 40*s for the job, and if this proves feasible, he would strongly recommend Major Clutterbuck, who made, he says, a great impression on him. Presumably Clutterbuck would not be prepared to retire from the_Corps, and when you write to the Government of India we should /beIlf 2622 be most grateful if you could raise with 9 possibility of arranging for this officer to be seconded, say for a period of three years in the first place. V/e realize to the full how inconvenient requests of this kind must be, but the authorities concerned in India will, I am sure, realize that the post to be filled in a key one, since communications through Iraq may at any time become of vital strategic importance* 4* Would you therefore now consult the Government of India? Until v/e learn their views I think that it would perhaps be best not to approach any of the individual officers mentioned. I am sending a copy of this letter to Waley. Yours sincerely.

I I- ' j 20th April, 193«; My dear Gibson, Many tnanks for your letter P.Z. 1996/39 of the 5tn April about the recruitment of a British judge for service in Iraq. We have now heard from the Embassy at Bagdad that a vacancy for a judge of first instance definitely exists, and we should therefore be most grateful if enquiries could be made of the Provincial Governments in India, as Metcalfe has suggested. v. 1/ [ J-P* Gibson, Esq,from India on the financial side. As regards the retired list, if we exclude Nixon^ as I think we probably must, I can think of no other ex-Central finance officers except ft,f.L.Brayne, who, if willing,would do very well, and possibly Nind, though I doulftt whether in any case he would want the ;}ob. I do not think any ex-Provincial finance officers with whom I have had contacts would be both willing and suitable. So we come back to someone like Bell. I should rather doubt whether his qualifications would justify us in pressing him in the face of any really serious objection on account of agej but my impression is that he does not carry his yearrs heavily. 13th April 1939* I am afraid I cannot add to the names mentioned here. I think A.F.L.Brayne, if he would take it, would be quite suitable. He has had considerable experience in the Finance Department of the Government of India and in addition to knowing about budgets, has also some knowledge of exchange and such like matters. He is about 55 years of age and when I last heard of him was at Bath. On personal grounds he would be quite suitable for this job but I have no idea whether he would take it. 17th April 1939* (E 2458/1889/93) FOREIGN OFFICE, ~ 4th April, / My dear Gibson, I fear I must trouble you again in regard to a vacancy in Iraq, 2, The Iraqi Government have decided not to renew the contract of Mr. Gascoigne Hogg, their Financial Adviser, and though no official request has yet been received General Nuri has intimated that they will ask us to recommend a successor. We do not know the exact terms of service, but the Embassy have suggested that we should make preliminary enquiries on the assumption that the terms will be the same as those offered to the Adviser in the Ministry of Economics and Communications last year. These are:- (a) A three-year contract on the standard terms for foreign officials in Iraq, of which I enclose a copy for convenience. (b) Salary: £2,600 for the first year, rising in the second and third years to £2,800 and £3,000. (c)/ J.P. Gibson, Esq.(c) This salary will he subject to Iraqi income tax (first £150 free of tax, next £150 taxed at 6^, and thereafter at rate of 9$). 2. The Embassy hold (and we entirely agree with them) that the requisite independence vis-h-vis of the Iraqis could best be assured if the Adviser were seconded from British Government service. The Treasury are, unfortunately, unable to spare anyone, and we should t therefore be most grateful if you could consider whether there is anyone in the service of the Government of India whom you could recommend. This is of course a key-post, and important not only to the Iraqis but also, in view of our existing stake in Iraq, to His Majesty’s Government. 3. If there is no one suitable who can be spared from Government service, we should be very glad to receive suggestions as to retired officials. The Treasury have suggested the name of Sir Robert Bell, but on the whole we are inclined to think that it would be preferable if possible not to recommend anyone to the Iraqi Government who was more than, say, 55.C.F. 21. * Contract for foreign Officials. made this day of 19.., between acting on behalf of the Government of Iraq (hereinafter called “the Govermnent ,, ) of the one part and (hereinafter called “the official”) of the other part, whereby it is agreed as follows:— 1.

Have you got anybody that yon would like to suggest? tfould it, for instance, suit Freke, late of Bombay, and do you think it is the sort of thing which he would be inclined to consider if a proposition was made to him?

My dear &lt;/aley, I send you herewith a copy of a telegram from Peteraon at Bagdad about the deciaion of the Iraqi Government not to renew Hogg’s contract, and their wish to find a succeaaor for him at the Ministry of Finance. You will see that, in Peterson’s view, the new adviser should, if possible, be seconded from British Government service. ./e fully agree with him about the great advantage of having an adviser who is in a really independent position vis a vis of the Iraqis, and we shall be very grateful if consideration could be given to the possibility of seconaing a Treasury official, as Peterson suggests. I). The terms of service to which he refers are those finally decided upon for the Economic Adviser appointed last year. They are A three year contract on the standard contract form G.F.E1, of which a copy is enclosed herein. Balary 112,600 for the first year, rising in the second and third years to £2,800 and £5,000. This will be subject to Iraqi income tax (first £150 free of tax, next £150 taxed at rate of 6 ( /c, and thereafter at rate of 9/o). If it is not possible for anyone to be seconded from the Treasury, we shall have to ask you for help in suggesting suitable names from outside. You will see, however, that, if an appointment from the Treasury is possible, Peterson would like to sound the Iraqi Government on the matter soon. He is due to leave Bagdad on the 20th March, daley. Esq., C.B., M.C. / andand we should therefore be very grateful if you could let us have a reply on this one point as soon as possible. &lt;/e note that Peterson does not recommend trying to persuade the Iraqis to keep Hogg on. He is no doubt right in this, but it seems to us that it will be very inconvenient if the Iraqis are left without any expert financial adviser when they are in the middle of negotiations with us about financial assistance. I should be glad to know whether, in your view, we should ask Peterson to urge on the Iraqis the desirability of keeping Hogg on at least until his successor arrives, or the credits question is settled. I am sending a copy of this letter to Nixon at the Export Credits Guarantee Department. Yours sincerely, (od.) L. Baggallay•Copy. NO OldTRIBUIIuN. Becode. Jir M. Peterson (Bagdad). 14th March, 1939.

Iraqi Government propose to dispense with his services as from March 31st. Prime Minister told me on March 12th that the Government would ask for a new Financial Adviser. In anticipation of formal request (which from past experience may take some time to reach the Smbassy) could pre liminary enquiries be made about a successor on the assumption that the terms of the contract will probably be similar to those of Mr. Loggin (see my telegram No. 159 1938). Candidate besides having all the obvious technical qualifications should be strong personality and tactful. (R ends). It is essential that he should not be content to wait to be asked to advise as I fear has been Hogg's technique. Requisite independence of attitude could, in my opinion, best be assumed if the adviser were seconded from the British service. A senior official of the Treasury would if available appear to be the best equipped to serve the interests of the Iraqi Govern ment and His Majesty's Government at the present juncture, in view of the special nature of financial difficulties, need of credits, proposed formation of a National Bank. Should this suggestion meet with your approval and that of the Treasury I should be grateful for early information in order that I may sound the Iraqi Government as to whether they wouldwelcome each an appointment# It would be very difficult to secure prolongation of Hogg’s contract and while I am seeing him to-day I do not recommend any attempt to do so#'N RCCn.

I'CejL Please refer to your letter No. P.Z.764/39, dated the 11th February 1939, asking for the views of the Government of India as to the possibility of finding a suitable junior Indian Civil Service officer for temporary appointment as a Judge in Iraq. Presumably the secondment of a relatively junior officer of about 7 to 9 years service with experience as a Judge is desired. So far as the Indian Political Service is concerned, there are no suitable officers available with the necessary judicial qualifications. As regards the Indian Civil Service cadre, the existing strength in practically all the Provinces is now below actual requirements, and it is very doubtful whether any Provincial Government would be able to spare an officer for the appointment. A further consideration is that the terms offered are not likely to prove attractive=—\ attractive to officers of 8 or 9 years service. I sun to say, however, that enquiries will, if desired, be made from Provincial Governments after it is known whether and when the new Judge will be required. To R. T.

Dear Peel, We have just learnt from Peterson at Bagdad that by agreement with the Iraqi Government Sir John Ward is giving up his position as Director-General of Railways and will confine himself, until he retires, to the management of the Port of Basra. The Iraqi Government have asked us to recommend someone suitable to succeed Ward in Railways. We do not yet know exactly what the terms of service will be, but it is probably safe to assume that the salary offered will be in the neighbourhood of £2,500 and that the contract will be for three years in the first instance. 2. You will remember that last year we approached various departments in the matter of a new Adviser in the Iraqi Ministry of Economics and Communications. Among the names that your or other departments suggested to us/ R.T. Peel, Esq., M.C. RECd. POL. DEPt. 24MAM939 INDIA OFFICE4./ us were those of Mr, H.C.M. Austen, Sir C.T. Mullings, Sir Preston Colvin and Sir 0* Mance, who are all railway experts* Distinguished as their records are, however, we are inclined to feel that it would be preferable to send out someone rather younger. As I have said, the contract will probably be in the first place for three years, but under the Agreement of 1936 with His Majesty's GrOvernment for the transfer of the Iraqi Railways there is to be a British Director General until 1956, and if the new man is a success, there seems no reason why his contract should not be renewed. What we have in mind, therefore, if we can find the right man, is someone of fifty or not much more. 3. It seems desirable that candidates should have had some experience of service overseas. This is not, however, perhaps an essential requirement if we can find an adaptable man with a really good record of service at home. What is essential is that he should have the qualities of tact and patience which will enable him to work harmoniously with his Iraqi colleagues and chiefs.l suggest any names to us for consideration.

My dear Gibson, Will you please refer to your letter P.Z.210/39 of the 19th January about the recruitment of a judge for service in Iraq? 2. We have noted the names of the three retired I.C.S. officers whom you suggest as possible candidates and we would be very glad to receive any further details about them which you may be able to furnish. At the same time, we still feel, for the reasons set out in the third paragraph of my letter of the 9th January, that, if it were found possible to second some comparatively junior judge, he would be likely to fill the bill better than a retired officer. We should accordingly be most grateful if, as suggested in your letter under reference, the Government of India could be consulted in the matter. 3./ J. P. Gibson, Esq. 1 .'J FEB 1939 i iMni.K OFFICE/3. We realize of course that it may he difficult to part with a competent judge; we hope, however, that if the position is explained to the Government of India, they will do what they can to overcome any difficulties on general grounds of policy. From our point of view it is important that the Irakis should not start appointing foreign officials, and if we are to stop them, we must he in a position to supply suitable people ourselves. 4. If the India Office feel able to make enquiries of the Government of India, it would probably be fair to tnem to make it clear that it is not for the moment entirely certain whether or when the new judge will be needed.)

Before p^oceedin^- , lurther, the Government of India would be glad if fclicw- ing points could be reconsidered; (a) Clause 1 of ^ntract,. Government of India regre it is not possible to at^ree to suggestion made by you, as under Fundamental Rules, to which surveyor are subject, they must relinquish charge of their posts at their respective headquarters in India and not on date on which they report for duty in Iraq.

Under Indian Audit rules suoh compensation or extraordinary pension is charge able to Government under which recipient of pension is serving when v/ound or injury is received. Government of India therefore consider that stipulation made in para. 2 of their express letter No.F.485-N/38, December 9th, should be accepted by Iraqi Government. It may be added that liability in question is only contingent, and its possible amount cannot be calculated at present. (c) Pa yment of pension contributi ons n etr&gt;. , Personnel selected will pay their pension contributions and sums on account of repayment of advances direct to Accountant General Central Revenues. It is hoped that Iraqi Government will give personnel such facilities as are possible for remittance of these sums to Accountant General Central Revenues through exchange accounts of Iraci 'Government.

W. 1 9th January, 1939 (E 7618/2515/93) 19b'.9 j My dear Gibson, I do not know if you are the right person to whom to address the following request for assistance. If you are not, perhaps you will pass this letter on to the proper quarter. 2. In the Summer of 1938, the Embassy at Bagdad were asked by the Iraqi Government for the names of candidates for appointment as Judge to take the place vacated by the resignation of the British President of the Court of First Instance at Basra. The conditions of service are as follows: (1) The candidate to be a member of the English Bar; (2) The period of the contract to be until the 2nd October, 1942 (when the Judicial Agreement between His Majesty^ Government and the Iraqi Government expires); (3)/(3) If a selected candidate is thoroughly acquainted with the Arabic language, or if he has had previous service as a Judge, he will be paid a salary of 112/500 Iraqi Dinars, (£112. 10. Od.) a month; otherwise he will be engaged on probation for a period of 2 years at a salary of 101/250 Iraqi Dinars (£101. 5. Od.) a month. On confirmation his salary will be raised to 112/500 Iraqi Dinars. (An Iraqi dinar is equivalent to £1 sterling. These salaries are subject to certain deductions, including Iraqi income tax, which rises to 9%,) (4) The candidate is to be engaged on the standard form of contract for British officials in Iraq. Although the retiring Judge was stationed at Basra, it is probable that this post v/ill be filled by one of the British Judges already in Iraq, and that the new Judge v/ill be appointed to a smaller town, probably Hillah or Baqubah. 5. We have here the names of a number of persons desiring judicial employment abroad. However, on enquiry it has proved that none of those whom v/e regard as possible/► ' possible candidates is prepared to consider the post. The chief difficulties appear to be that the period of service (less than four years, with no assurance of employment of any kind thereafter) is not sufficient to tempt any young man to throw up whatever work he may be doing at present, and that the post is not senior enough to attract retired Judges from the Colonial or Indian Judicial Services, who seem the only category who might consider short-term employment of the kind. 4. We have therefore come to a dead end. It would really be most unfortunate if we proved unable to recommend any suitable candidates to the Iraqi Government, especially if our inability to do so led to the appointment of a non- British Judge. It has, however, occurred to us that it might be possible to get someone suitable if we could get sanction for his secondment for the four years from India or the Colonial Service. The shortness of the period of service would then be no objection, since he would be able to return to his parent service in 1942. We realise that it may be difficult for you to second one of your officials and we have put off asking you to do so until we have quite exhausted the possibilities elsewhere. But as I have/if' &amp;/ have said above, we seem now to have reached that stage, and we should therefore be most grateful if you could find out for us v/hat the possibilities of seconding someone suitable are. The official seconded would of course have to be a European. A similar letter is being addressed to Jeffries at the Colonial Office.(B 220/220/93) Dear Gibson, With reference to your letter P.Z.7862/38 of 29th November 1938,1 write to let you know that we have now heard from the Embassy at Bagdad that the post of Chief Engineer to the Iraqi Irrigation Department is to be filled by Mr. T.D. Atkinson, who has been serving as an Irrigation Engineer under the Egyptian Government. Would you arrange for Mr. Bigsby to be informed accordingly? We are most grateful to him for his willingness to consider this post, and to you and the Government of India for your help. J.P. Gibson, Esq. RESO. POL.

Addressed to Government of India No. 7 Saving. Your express letter No. F s 485-N/38. To make position clearer I think I should explain that the Iraqi Government do not desire again to enter into the complicated commitments incurred when Indian surveyors were obtained in 1932 for demarcation of Syrio-Iraqi frontier, but wish to employ them on a fixed inclusive salary on standard contracts, the terms of which are familiar to their own finance authorities^ Rates of pay suggested have been fixed accordingly. If terms offered are unsatisfactory it might be possible to obtain slightly higher rates of pay (though I should prefer not to have to ask for this) but I am sure that depart ments concerned would be most reluctant either to enter into detailed amendment of clauses of standard contract offered or to accept obligations beyond those contained therein. Bearing these circumstances in mind and in the light of the further explanations offered below on the specific points raised in your telegram I hope that Government of India will find means to arrange secondment of surveyors on terms proposed by Iraqi Governmento If however this is not possible best alternative would be for Government of India themselves to pay all salaries and allowances due to men concerned and to quote inclusiveinclusive charge for loan of their services to Iraqi government. Clause 1 . Could not Government of India make the date on which the surveyors relinquish charge of their posts coincide with date on which their contract service with Government of Iraq begin, ioe, date on which they report for duty in Iraq. Clause 4 . Rates offered for voyage period will I am advised probably be about 50% in excess of Indian rates of pay of personnel concernedo These rates should therefore be suffi cient to enable men to pay pension contributions without loss. Clause 6 (1) and (dj . Probable position will be that surveyors will be on duty up to termination of their contract and will then be given passage to India ana leave earned for which pay will be given in advance. Return voyage will then fall within leave period ana question of half pay will not arise. Clause 5 (2) . Total permissible for incidental expenses on outward voyage is £2. Paragraph 2 o Department concerned has been consulted un officially on this point. Their view is that risk of injury or loss of life will be no greater in Iraq than India and that such risks are presumably covered on an actuarial basis by pensions fund of men's parent service contributions to which are to be maintained by men themselves while they are serving in Iraq* Claim to capitalised value of pension payable in circumstances mentioned would not therefore appear to be justif iedo Paragraph S. Efforts will be made to arrange through the Chiei British Surveyor of Survey Department that men shall not be brought within scope of Officials Mutual Guarantee Fund Law but no undertaking can be given.

As the surveyors will have to pay pension contributions for the entire period of their foreign service, the grant of half salary provided for in this clause my not even amount to Indian pay in the case of the higher paid men, and it would not be fair to ask them to pay pension contri bution out of the reduced pay.

It is suggested that the incidential expenses to be prescribed by the Iraqi Government should be auf±icient to cover all personal expenses including carriage of personal effects. °a d).e Tiie last sentence of this clause is not clear It is presumed that surveyors will be able to take full leave earned by them at the conclusion of their work before ter- ruination oi their contract or a cash gratuity in lieu of the leave. (In this connection please see clause 11 of the contract). Clause 11. H Gratuity in lieu of leave” has not been clearly defined. It is presumed that the gratuity will be the cash equivalent of the leave salary which would have been paid to the surveyor if he had availed himself of the leave. If this presumption is correct, a stipulation to this effect, it is suggested, should be added at the end of clause 6 of the contract with an option to the employee to take leave or gratuity in lieu thereof. 2. ^o stipulation exists in the contract, for compensation or extra-ordinary pension for injury or loss of life in the execution oi duty.

Dear Peel, Will you please refer to your letter P.Z. 4609/38 of the 4th July last to Baxter about the various candidates whom the Government of India have suggested for the post of Economic Adviser to the Iraqi Ministry of Economics and Communications. 2. We duly passed on the names of the suggested candidates to the Embassy at Bagdad, and our Charg£ d f Affaires has now written to us about Mr. Bigsby, the Chief Engineer of Irrigation, Punjab, in connexion with another post, that of Chief Engineer to the Iraqi Irrigation Department. Houstoun-Boswall tells us in a letter dated the 28th September that the Acting Iraqi Minister of Economics and Communications asked him, in the course of a long conversation, whether Mr. Bigsby would care to be considered for this latter post. The Minister who has not yet raised the subject with his colleagues and who R.T. Peel, Esq., M.C. ?jL i 2 0 OCT 19383 I who was therefore speaking confidentially, stated that he would like this appointment to he for three years in the first instance, as such a term would give the Iraqis a chance to ascertain how the official in question turned out. He said that he intended to propose to his colleagues a beginning salary of 2,000 Iraqi dinars per annum, rising by annual increments of 200 Iraqi dinars to 2,400 Iraqi dinars. The Minister added that, while he could not guarantee the policy which would be followed by any new Minister or by his successors, what he himself had always preached was that it was no use engaging highly qualified experts from the United Kingdom unless full advantage were taken of the advice they offered. He also pointed out that the reason why the Iraqi Government are prepared to pay such high salaries is that they want very highly qualified men of wide experience, who are among the leaders of their professions. We understand that the Chief Engineer in the Irrigation Department will be the senior foreign official of that section of the Ministry of Economics and Communications.3. I should therefore he most grateful if you could let us know as soon as possible whether Mr. Bigsby would be prepared to accept the irrigation appointment if it were offered to him.

Dear Symon, It has 'been suggested to us that the India Office might he able to assist in finding a successor to Mr. H.H. Wheatley, Adviser to the Iraqi Ministry of Economics and Communications, who has retired after holding that post for many years. The question of finding a candidate for this appointment has been under discussion for some time, as a result of unofficial enquiries from the Iraqi Government, in consultation with the petroleum Department and the Treasury, but hitherto without much success. We have recently been informed that the Iraqi Government have now asked officially for the assistance of His Majesty’s Government in finding a suitable candidate, (I attach copies of two telegrams from the Embassy in Bagdad) and the matter is therefore of some urgency. 2 ./ A.C.B. Symon, Esq. 'Tl/a S C o/2. It will be seen that the Iraqi Government want someone with an adequate knowledge of general engineering, who without being necessarily an oil expert, should have a close knowledge of oil matters and also have experience of irrigation and public works. They no doubt want a general adviser on all matters of economic development, including road development, irrigation, etc. There is no apparent need for the candidate to be a qualified engineer, but he should be able to give general advice on engineering problems. We appreciate that it will not be easy to find a candidate who fulfils all the Iraqi requirements, especially someone who possesses a knowledge of oil matters, together with the other qualifications. Nevertheless, if we could find a man who had to his credit outstanding achievements in even one of the fields of engineering activity referred to, it might be possible to persuade the Iraqi Government to overlook a lack of experience in the others. 3. Although we do not know the exact salary which the Iraqi Government are willing to offer, the fact that Mr. Wheatley was receiving, after many years of service, between £2,000 and £2,400 a year gives an indication of what/mmtm !— what might he offered. All British officials in Iraq, have to pay Iraqi income tax which, after a free allowance of £150, is at the rate of 6$ for the next £150 and 9$ on all additional income. The Government officials do not receive any customs immunity, hut they have certain perquisites such as the chance of obtaining a Government-owned house at a low rent. There is no pension, hut their exists an arrangement whereby British officials pay one twelfth of their salary into a •‘Provident Fund*’ the Iraqi Government contributing a similar amount. The money accumulates at compound interest until the official leaves the country, when he can draw out his share as a lump sum. 4. We are asking the Embassy for further particulars in regard to the terms of the appointment, and we will let you know when we have got a reply. 5. In the meantime, we should be most grateful if you would make urgent enquiries as to whether you can find anybody likely to prove suitable. The appointment is, as you will appreciate, one of considerable importance, and it would be very undesirable that the Iraqis should appoint a foreigner, which they are certain to do if His Majesty’s Government cannot find an adequate candidate/candidate in the near future 6. Sir Maurice Peterson, our Ambassador at Bagdad, has suggested that the Government of India might perhaps be able to second a good man for a few years. Even if no one is available with a knowledge of oil matters, they must, he thinks, have men who have attractive records in irrigation, roads and public works, and it may be possible to persuade the Iraqis that oil is not after all so important as they think. 7. Perhaps you might show this letter to someone in the Burma Office as they may think there is a reasonable likelihood of finding a good man in Burma who has a knowledge of oil matters. 8. I am also writing to the Colonial Office and Crown Agents. Yours sincerely.r NO DISTRIBUTION I Telegram (en clair) from Sir M. Peterson (Bagdad) 24th hay 1938. D. 24th hay 1938. R. 26th May 1938.
