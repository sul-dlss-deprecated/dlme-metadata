Dear Colonel Loch: From time to time we are faced with the question of the relative importance of the religious holidays observed by the Mohammedans, either Sunni or ohiah or both. The men come to us at frequent intervals and ask for a day off or, if not that, for permission to go to town in the evening, presumably to attend at their mosques. If you have it, we would appreciate your giving us a list showing holidays of either sect which are of sufficient importance that the men should be granted a day off and, also, those of lesser importance which warrant their being transported to and from town in the evening in order to permit them to visit their mosques. Yours sincerely, FAD: J E.A. SKINNER Lieut.
