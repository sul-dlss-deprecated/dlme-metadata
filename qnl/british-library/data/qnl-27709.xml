Dear Mr, Walton, In confirmation of our conversation this morning, I am suggesting to Ma^jor Holmes the insertion in each of the Trucial Coast Draft Concessions of an Article designed to cover the position which would arise in the case of an inter se dispute between two of the Shaikhs (or possibly between one of the Shaikhs and a semi-inaependent inlying tribe) . There is no doubt that in such an event we might find ourselves quite unable to proceed, and although the suggested solution involves invoking the good offices of the Political Resident over what might be far from an easy matter, I cannot think of any other way, and you yourself this morning seemed sympathetic to this suggestion. Would some such formula as the following meet the case? 'The Shaikh agrees that, in the event of a difference of opinion between him and any other ruler or authority as to whether a given place or district is properly to be considered as within his territory or in that of the other ruler or authority, he will accept without reserva tion the decision of the Political Resident on this matter, and will, in so far as lies in his power, nrevent the existence of the dj spute from affecting adversely the operations of the Company in any manner. * The Company similarly agrees without reservation to accept such decision.'- 2 - If, 13 s you suggested, the Political Resident is able to orogress towards an official definition of the respective areas, this would, of course, make it much less likely that we should have to have recourse to the suggested Article.

I enclose Jaerewitn Dotes of trie conversation which I had oh the 6th April with Holmes and Arnold, of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, who visited Bushire in order to discuss Oil matters with me, I informed them that any opinions I gave in the course of the conversation were merely tentative and liable to revision on further reflection* Holmes and Arnold arrived at Bushire late on the evening of the btn April and Holmes left at 10*30 on the morning of the 6th, so there was not much time for discussion as far as Holmes was concerned. However, we covered the ground fairly thoroughly. a I am sending copies of this letter together with all the enclosures to Metcalfe and with the relevant enclosures to de Gaury, Loch and Watts* J. C. Walton Esquire, CB*,MC., The India Office, London, 'i ■* ! 4 MAY 1936 K'' D ■ r\ Or HCETRUCIAL COAST I explained to ifejor Holmes and Mr. Arnold that one of the important points with regard to P.C.L. operations in this area was that the Shaikhs should agree to Condition (e) - protection of Company’s employees and surveying parties (vide Government of India telegram Wo.766 of 24th March 1956 to the India Office). While the concession areas st Kuwait and Bahrain were saife, the same was not the case along the Trucial Coast where the various Shaikhs exercise practically no control over the Beduoin in the interior, and that therefore some such clause was necessary. On my recent tour along the Coast, Ihad given letters to the Shaikhs concerned, asking them to agree to tnis clause. Should any Shaikh refuse to agree then obviously he did not feel himself able to afford proper protection to the employees of the Company and the Company therefore would not operate in his area. I thought,however, that the Shaikhs would agree to the clause sooner or later, and ir the meantime I did not think it necessary to hold up Major H. 1 s negotiations with these Shaikhs pending their reply. I would'merely write to the Shaikhs pointing out to the unless they did agree to Condition (c) His Majesty’s Govern ment wouldnot sanction the grant of any option or concession BUSHI.BE, 6 th ^pril, 1956MUSCAT AND O MAN. I explained to Major Holmes and Mr .Arnold the difficulty of getting in touch with the Sultan who was at Dhofar. Major Watts who is flying down there shortly to see the Sultan could inform him, without producing any specific agreement, that the P.C.L. wisned to operate in his territory, and then report on his reactions. I explained that one of the difficulties that the Company will ha^e to face in this area was that the Sultan dad only effective control of the coast. Major H. said that expert opinion generally was that the oil-bearing area probably lay between SUE and DHOFAR. I pointedout that this was somewhat unfortunate as in tnis area, except for Sur and Dhofar themselves, the Sultan’s control even over the coast was very light. However, it was agreed that there was no particular hurry about Muscat territory, and in the meantime Major H. would have plenty to occupy himself with in Bahrain and the Trucial Coast. T.C.F.

That is to say, tnat if tne P.C.L. offered to merge witn tne California Oil Company on terms of 60-40,ana tne California Oil Company stood up for more than 40 per cent, they would not receive Ibn Baud’s support. 5. Mnjor H* gave me a copy of nis proposed option i or tne Neutral zone, on whicn my comments will fellow. T.C.F. BUSHIRE. 6th April 1956BAHRAIN. i. Major Holmes rather to my surprise said that though he had 1 nformed Mr. Skinner iniorrsa i ly of the P.C.L.'s proposal to obtain a concession from the Shaikh with regard to the remaining area of Bahrain not covered by the Bahrain Petroleum Company's concession, Mr. Skinner did not appear in any way perturbed,nor did he (Major H.) think that the B.P.C. proposed to compete with the P.C.I.. in the matter of the remaining area. However, he irill be able to confirm this attitude when he returns to Bahrain. 2. Major Holmes said that Mr. Skinner had informed him tha-t they - the B.P.C. - were 'sitting pretty' with His Majesty's Government i.e. were on good terms with them. That the B.P.C. much appreciated the sympathetic attitude and assistance which His Majesty's Government had extended towards them and were out to reciprocate in every way possible. g. The questionof the rights of the B.P.C. outside their ctual oil area in the matter of fresh water, telephones, pipe-lines, Sitra harbour, roads, etc. was then discussed. To cover these rights a Clause 2'i (a) had, «t the uigge-t' of the India Office (see India Office telegram No.987 of 18th March 1936) teen inserted in the proposed Leased Area by Major H. I suggested that Major H. might go into the vaiious po_n concerned with Mr. Skinner and to report accordantly to his Company or this might be deferred until the -.C.L. hao- „ctUolly got their concession; it was presumably for the Comp, rt to decide. of flying facilities for the P.C.L. was 4. The question 01 £ \ i 4 qpptried to 'bo that the then discussed. MajorH.'s general idee -p.C.L. might establish a sort of centre in Bahrain in touch by air with the other areas, chiefly the Trucial Coast. • I pointed out that the Rulers of Kuwait, Bahrain and Muscat had forbidden private flyers to fly over or land in their territories. The idea of this was to prevent single- engined. machines flying down the Ara.b Coast which is un suitable for such machines, and it might be possible to obtain permission for commercial planes of the P.C.L. to fly over these areas. (There is no mention of flying rights in the B.P.C. concession, and they do not require such rights since their area of operations is a small one, while P.C.L., if they obtain all the concessions they want, will cover the whole of the Arab Coast of the Persian Gulf). 5 . On the assumption that the P.C.G. would obtain their concession I raised the question as to whether their trill ing operations would interfere with those of the B.P.C.s whether their wells might not tap the latter's supply. Such a Such a state of affair had, I understood, occurred in some Oil-field where two rival Companies were operating side by side. Major H. said that to meet such an eventuality he new paragraph instead of the present one Government . 11 For T, His Britannic Majesty’s Gov paragraph Colonel Loch, so Major * s Government 45 at the end ol the H. informed me, had suggested /suggested that 'the Shaikh' should he substituted. (The Shaikh is obviously the interested party but he will of course look to His Majesty's Government for advice on such a technical matter, and I suggest that the words 'of the Shaikh acting on the advice of His Majesty's Government' should be substituted for 'of His BritarmicMajesty's Government 1 *) • T*C.F• PUSFTRE. 6 th April 1956,Draft Paper P.Z.3163/36 Department. ^ J.

In the first place it is I think clear that in Mr. Longrigg's telegram the words 'responsible party' mean the individual Sheikh concerned, not Petroleum Concessions Ltd. Colonel Fowle was at first inclined to the view that it would be desirable, before letting Major Holmes start negotiations with any individual Trucial ruler, to wait until that ruler had given an undertaking that he would be responsible for the safety of the Company’s employees. On further reflection he was disposed to modify that view: he felt that the sheikhs would agree to a protection undertaking sooner or later -^of course^ if they do not, H.M.G. can refuse assent to any concession^ and that it would be unnecessary to hold up Major Holmes’ negotiations meanwhile. Mr. Longrigg's telegram therefore seems to be based on an out-of-date apprehension. Our papers show that on the 14th * April Colonel Fowle sent to Colonel Loch, | for transmission to the sheikhs oi Abu Dhabi/Diiabi, Dibai, Siiarjaii, Ajman and Ras-al- Kiiaimali, letters of which I enclose epooim^^tsopy’* Copies of the letters were to be given by colonel Loch to Major Holmes. They appear t-e me- to be en^eiy satisfactory from your point of viewf We have no reason to suppose that these letters have not actually been despatched to the Sheikhs.

Dear Mr. Walton, I should have acknowledged before the receipt of your letter P.Z. 2078/36 dated the 2nd April, in which you stated that there would be no objection to negotiations being started with the Trucial Coast Chiefs, subject to certain conditions. My Board has recently appointed Mr. S.H. Longrigg to be General Manager of the Company, and Mr. Longrigg left here on Friday last for Cairo, to meet Major Holmes and to discuss the situation generally with him. I have now received from Mr. Longrigg the following telegram:- nwiLL INDIA OFFICE NOW INSTRUCT BUSHIRE THAT HOLMES MAY OPEN CONCESSION NEGOTIATIONS WITH PIRATE COAST AREA ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT RES PONSIBLE PARTY HAS SIGNED OR UNDOUBTEDLY WILL SIGN PROTECTION CLAUSE 11 . I gather from this telegram that the steps indicated In Clause (1) of paragraph 3 of your letter have been duy taken, but that there is some doubt whether Major Holmes may proceed to open negotiations with the Chiefs until the 'Political 11 Agreement referred to m Clauses (3) ana of that paragraph has been signed, COPY cr of nV Ain ^A• * v SEN' E- -On that assumption I should be greatly obliged a telegram could be sent to the Political Resident, that Major Holmes may be authorised to proceed with negotiations in anticipation of the signature by P.' the 'Political” Agreement referred to.

The Sultan of Muscat, who was expected back in his capital in April, is now intending to spend several months longer in the interior of his State (in Dhofar), where he is inaccessible except by a prolonged desert journey or, in emergency, by R.A.F* aeroplanes. In these circumstances, it would be exceedingly difficult for Major Holmes to get in touch with him, and it looks 3kli.ros Esq as/ Petroleum Concessions Ltd., City-Gate House, Finsbury Square, E.C. 2*2. as if any detailed, negotiations will have to he left over till next season.

The way will then be open to Major Holmes, (2) Major Holmes will be required to keep in close touch with the Political Agent, Bahrein and keep him informed of the progress of the negotiations* (3) No concession can, of course, be finally concluded without the specific further approval of His Majesty's Government, who will require the Company to enter into a separate 'political” agreement with them* (4) it will be sufficient at this stage to define the boundaries of the concessions as those of the respective Sheikhdoms without attempting to prepare maps* (5) As regards the protection of the Company’s employees, in the event of a concession being obtained and operated, responsibility will fall on the Sheikh concerned. As a corollary of this, it is proposed to include in the 'political' agreement a clause to the effect that any movements of employees entailing special risks (e.g. penetration for more than a certain distance away from the coast) should be subject to the prior written permission of the Sheikh.0) 4. 4.

J A - -f A O Abadan, Dated 1st February 1936* My dear Fowle, Further to my telegram of the 18th January, you ha v e possibly now heard something from the India Office concerni^ Holmes*s appointment as negotiator for Petroleum Concessions Limited, but, in case you have not, you might be interested in such information as I have received from n&lt;y London Office. I understand that Holmes has three tasks s- (1) tL°^ ai vv,f grant fr0Dl the Shaikh of Kuwait of the Shaikh s interest in the Neutral Zone. (2) To obtain from the Shaikh of Bahrain an option ot concession over that part of Bahrain which is not covered by the 100,000 acres selected, or to be selected, by the Bahrain Petroleum Companyl ^ ^?^ ai V* ten ° l0n ? 0:f existin 6 options from the Shaikhs of the Trucial Coast* I have not received any information with regard to the first two items o With regard to the third, it would appear that the intention is that Holmes should endeavour to negoti ate extensions of the present options to 5 years and that these extensions should include the terms of definite concessions of 75 years which the Company could take up at any time it wished during the currency of the options* It is not apparently proposed to make any formal transfer of the existing options to P*C*L. as the latter, being an associated company of ours, is entitled to negotiate with the Shaikhs under the terms of the options. It is assumed also that there is no necessity to convey H*M*G* r s approval of the existing options to the Shaikhs before Holmes proceeds to the Trucial Coast. The procedure discussed in London was that Holmes should approach the Shaikhs with letters of introductions from /-2 fronyou in which, it is suggested, the Shaikhs could be infomed that H.M.G. approves of the options already granted to us and is agreeable to further negotiations under these options being conducted bv HBlmpn oo « ^ y floimes as a representative of p c L I understand the India Office have been connnunicated with on’ ’ this point and they will no doubt mention it should they write to you on the subject generally Holmes will also, of course, have letters of introductions from us to the Shaikhs in which the latter will be informed that he represents f.C.l. an associated company of ours with whom, we trust, they will be able to negotiate mutually satisfactory agreements^ nth regard to your letter Ko,1055 of the 31st December in which you officially informed us of H.M.G.'s approval of the options obtained up to that time subject to certain conditions, I gather that the India Office have prescribed identical conditions for P.C.L. who have accepted them. It is not clear from theietters I have received, however, whether the India Office hate approved of P.C.l. proceeding to negotiate extensions of the present options or new concessions with the Shaikhs, or whether, if such approval has been given, the conditions necessary to safeguard Government interests have been considered,, Until the position is clearer, therefore, I am not replying to your letter No® 1055* If all arrangements have been made direct between the India Office and P*C.L*, I presume these points have been covered and there should be no necessity for further correspondence here. Holmes on his arrival will no doubt be able to throw light on any points such as the above which are at present somewhat obscure* /X \ la a ‘' OJ ^Oijqo nsiini/;; H aidl oj oH 3JJ 00 ^ 9ri iatij w ,®ds alai^e 1 W oiifw t!l anoiJqo oiiJiSB I {d^fi53 id flioil uiW tsnstxs ;til)n 03 ID Ill 5?1 ^ [ gS9 J - :ui ^ K nz &gt; obscure 0 He was due to leav^ 'R’ntjTEin^ at 10 -Leave England on the 23rd of January but was going to spend some time in Cairo on his way. i understand he will be visiting you soon after his arrival and that he hopes to complete all his work in three or four months„ I think he proposes starting with the Kuwait job and does not anticipate being ready to start for the Trucial Coast until about the beginning of March* Yours sincerely, sd.

The situation appears to be a little confused but as I understand it is as follows. Your Company, acting as a member of the I.P.C., h s obtained options from all the Trucial Shaikhs with the exception of Uram-al-quw&amp;in. His Majesty^ Government have approved of these options provided your Company agrees to the conditions laid down in my letter Ho. 1055-3 of 31st December 193b. Your Company have not yet notified me of their ecceptance of these conditions, though P.C.L. have accepted them. But as P.C.I. are working the options qua one of your associated compfinies , it would be more in order if your Company signified their acceptance. 4. The P.C.L., one of your associated companies, t irougi Holmes, now intends to extend the present options to 5 years, these extensions to include terms oi definite concessions up to 75 years, which the Compsny can take up at / S.H.O.TSlkington Esquire, General Manager, Angl o— I ran i an Oi 1 0 o • Lt d. , Abadan*at any time it wishes during the currency of the options (your paragraph 2) • I note - vide the same paragraph - that it is not apparently proposed to make any formal transfer of the existing options to P.C.L. since the latter, being an associated company of yours, is entitled to negotiate with the Shaikhs under the terms of the options. His MaJ esty *8 Government have, however, approved of the transfer of the options, subject to P.C.L. accepting the conditions attached to them, which the P.C.l. have done. Before the P.C.L. enter into negotiations with any Shaikh re* the 75 years (mentioned by you) they will - under condition (d) - have to obtain the sanction of His Majesty’s Govermaent. Similarly if the P*C.L. - as intimated by you - wish to extend the options obtained by the Anglo-Iranian Gil Company to 5 years they will have to obtain His Majesty’s Government’s approval. But before Holmes, on behalf of the P.C.L., begins any negotiations with the Shaikhs of the 'frucial Coast condition (c) will have to be accepted by the Shaikhs concerned. 5. In addition to the options obtained from the Shaikhs of Kas al Khaimah, Sharjah and Bibai, which were dealt with in m letter of 31st December, I telegraphed the India Office for approval of the Abu Dhabi and Ajraan options subject to the acceptance of the condition®, but have not yet had a reply. 6.

Draft D raises with Colonel Powle the question as to whether there is any moral obligation on us to inform the Bahrein Petroleum Company,who already hold about half the area of Bahrein, that we are allowing another Company to apply to the Sheikh for rights over the unallotted portion.

Sheikh should be informed tnat Petroleum Concessions Limited, having asked His Majesty’s Government for permission to approach His Excellency with a view to negotiating for the unallotted area on basis of draft concession submitted, have been informed that His Majesty’s Government have no objection to their doing so. Presumably Holmes will be required to approach Sheikh through Political Agent in the first instance, but having done so might conduct detailed negotiations direct while keeping Political Agent informed of their progress. 4 .

The following preliminary conclusions have been reached at tnis stage on questions of (1) Boundaries ( 2 ) Protection. As regards ( 1 ), it will he sufficient at this stage to define areas of concessions as those of the respective Sheikhdoms without annexing maps, hut eventually it will he desirable to define boundaries so far as possible, and His hajesty’s Government accordingly suggest that Resident should take steps to enquire into boundaries of various Sheikhdoms an( i vis-a-vis Muscat. Question of boundary between Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia would depend on course of negotiations with Ibn Saud. As regards (2) His Majesty’s Government are inclined to view that so far as possible all responsibility for protection should be placed by the concession agreement on Sheikhs themselves (compare Art. 15 of draft concessions and condition (c) attached to approval of the options) ? but provision could also be made in political agreements and in accompanying exchange of letters between Government and Sheikhs concerned that any movements of Company’s employees entailing special risks (e.g.? penetration for more than a certain distance/ ) i 1 ■I Adistance into the hinterland) should h e 3 ' outgect to prior permission of Sheikh who would thus Toe responsible for saying where Company could operate and consequently (in the event of any incident occurring) for taking all possible action against the culprits and paying any compensation which His Majesty's Government might consider necessary, 6 . As regards Bahrein, Trucial Sheikhdoms and Muscat, we should emphasise Both to Holmes and the rulers concerned in informing them of permission to start negotiations that no concession can he finally concluded without specific further approval of His Majesty’s Government, who would require Company to enter into separate political agreement v/ith them. 7* Please see separate telegram regarding Kov/eit Neutral Zone . 8 . I should he glad of your and Resident’s concurrence or observations in above proposals. Draft concessions would he examined here from legal point of view and corresponding political agreements would he drafted. As regards general form of concessions His Majesty’s Government are satisfied that it is in accordance v/ith usual procedure of oil companies nowadays to link exploration and mining concessions together.DRAFT TELEGRAM.

A meeting of the following representatives or the Departments concerned was held at the India Office on February 21st to consider whether His Majesty's Goverament could authorise the proposal of Petroleum Concessions Ltd. to enter into negotiations for oil concessions in Bahrein, tne Kuwait neutral Zone and the six Trucial Sheikhdoms: Mr. Walton ) Mr.Clauson ) Lord Hood ) Mr.Bendel ) Mr.Brenan ) Mr.Seal Wing C oramand er Pirie India Office.

It was agreed that Petroleum Concessions Limited should be allowed to open negotiations with the Sheikh for a concession on the basis of the draft which they had submitted, on the understanding that any concession would be subject to His Majesty's Government’s approval and would be accompanied by a 'political” agreemenl between the Company and His Majesty’s Government. A question was raised whether it might perhaps be well to inform the Bahrein Petroleum Company, with whom certain correspondence regarding the unallotted area took place in 1933, that PetroleumV Concessions limited were entering into negotiations wit, the Sheiich. A deoision on thlS ^tothe India Office but it Was that it Would -nr'ATa Vs-! would probably be preferabl not to do so. (2) I1: was a S re ed that Petroleum Concessions Ltd. might approach the Sultan with a view to opening negotiations for a concession (on the same understandings as in the case of Bahrein). it was agreed that Petroleum Concessions Limited should be allowed to enter into negotiations with the Sheikhs with a view to obtaining concessions on the basis of tne drafts submitted. in this connection the following points arose. ( a ) it was agreed that for tne purposes of the concessions it would be sufficient to define the areas in question as H the territories of the Sheikh'. Mr.Rendel, however, suggested that it was feasible and desirable to fix forthwith the boundaries of the various Trucial Sheikhdoms, except in the case of the Saudi-Abu Dhabi boundary. It was therefore agreed that Colonel Bowie should be asked to submit his recommendations for the definition of the boundaries of the Sheikhdoms inter se and vis-a'-vis Muscat, but that this need not delay the negotiations for the concessions.- - r- (t) ^ 0 -S-^i2n. It was agreed that the Sheikhs should he held responsible, so far as possible (of. draft Article 15), for the safety of the Company and its personnel, sauce , however, His Majesty's Sovernment 1 s international responsibility might possibly oeccme involved if, for example, non-British personnel were concerned in any serious incident, it was agreed that, while there mignt be no need in the 'political'agreement to lay any definite restriction upon the Company in regard to the spheres of its activities, itUaight be desirable to require the Company to obtain the Sheikh’s approval before undertaking work entailing special risks, e.g. , penetration to more than a certain distance into the hinterland. It was agreed that some such provision could be included in the 'political' agreement to be signed between the Company and His Maje s t y's G overnment. ( c ) Refinery. Mr.Seal suggested that we wanted more from the Company than the expression of a pious hope, and that Petroleum Concessions Limited might be asked to give an undertaking to erect a- refinery if the sum total of the oil produced in the various concessions exceeded a certain fixed output - say 500,000 tons a year. It was suggested that a clause to this effect might4 . be proposed to the Canpany in each of the political agreements between His Majesty's Government and the Company when these are drafted. it was agreed that the India Office should send a separate letter to Mr.Skliros informing him that some such undertaking would probably be suggested. (4) Koweit 'eutrajLZone^ It was agreed that this draft concession should be treated separately om 'k L&amp; °thers , and. that before sending any reuly to the Company Sir Andrew Ryan should be consulted. General. 1 * me conclusion of the concessions between the Company and the Sheikhs should be subject to the conclusion of satisfactory 'political” agreements between the Company and His Majesty's Government safeguarding the interests and desiderata of the latter. These would be accompanied by exchanges of letters between His Majesty's Government and the Sheikhs making the Concession agreements subordinate to the 'political” agreements. A draft of the 'political'agreements would be prepared and circulated. 2. The India Office legal advisers would be asked to examine the draft concessions submitted by the Company. 3. The conclusions stated above regarding the opening of negotiations by the Company in respect of Bahrein, the Trucial Coast and Muscat are subject to consultation with Colonel Howie.0-64 groopB'; r&gt; v i*Ur i I 25 4 936 W64.

We have since received from the Company details of their plans (Mr. Skliros’ letters of 30 th January) and drafts of the concessions which they propose to negotiate through Major Holmes, with the Rulers of Koweit, Bahrein and certain Trucial Sheikhdoms. T he drafts are at present under scrutiny and a meeting is being held shortly between the interested D epartments.^ My cir ‘ cular letter of 13th February states the points for consideration.

On the question 1 of procedure in regard to the approval of the options already obtained by the D*Arcy/ ^D’Arcy Exploration Coy. ( alias A.P.O.C.) I have consulted Fowls. That is a comparatively unimportant matter. The main question is whether we can now allow the Coy. to authorise Holmes to enter into negotiations with the various Sheikhs (who would visit Bahrein for the purpose) on the basis of the draft Concessions, subjedt, of course, to the concurrent negotiation df satisfactory agreements between the Coy. and H.M.G. It will be noted that the Coy, propose to apply for concessions straight away without waiting to do any exploratory work under the existing options. Skliros t • t * * and Lefroy called here on 6 th February and explained that their reasons for this are not any desire to rush us, but that their arrangements with Holmes make it desirable to get the whole thing settled as soon as possible; and apart from this they wish to enter at once into firm agreements with the Sheikhs (from which of course the latter would benefit financially), because the price of the concessions might be unduly enhanced in the event (improbable though they think it) °f oil having actually been found in one oif more of the territories concerned before the concessions are obtained^-and-they prefer tp-get ths-Sh&amp;^i q ■■ 11 etP-do-wn now e -problematic 5 ./ r \Draft Paper.

As regards the latter point, Art. 15 of the draft | concessions puts certain responsibility on the Sheikh (which seems right, so far, at any rate, as it goes). 6 . The question of a refinery will of course be dealt with in the Govt, agreement. 7. Koweit Geutral Zona . This question presents difficulties.

Having regard to the delay which from our discussions yesterday is likely, beyond that previously anticipated by Skliros, to take place in a direct contact between Holmes and these Shaikhs, I think it is on the whole better that Abadan should at an early date write to each of the Shaikhs concerned. The instructions we have given them read as follows: 'As regards a communication from us to the individual Shaikhs of the contemplated negotiations by P.C.L., we think that in the altered circumstances of the anticipated delay in the inauguration of negotiations between Major Holmes and the Shaikhs it would on the whole be better for you to notify them COPY SENT b\ AIR MAIL ^ 2 1 FF8 1958 to- 2 - 'in the near future of the likelihood of these n Jo t -%T improbable ci 18- ?! u Ve S 5 egotiations be ‘tween P.C.L. and the a Shaikhs have to be delayed for a time owing to discussions at this end as to procedure, Major Holmes fr 2 m communication with the Shaikhs, and ^2 circu ^stances it may lead to less suspicion if we also notify them. We suggest that the notification should include a statement that the approval by His Majesty 1 s Government of the agreement into which we have entered is under consideration in London, and that meanwhile discussions have taken place between London Principals and Petroleum Concessions Ltd., a British company of standing and repute in which we are partners, regarding the exploration and contingent exploitation of the Shaikh’s territories. These discussions have been carried on with the kno?/ledge of H.M.G., and we are awaiting the approval of H.M.G. to direct discussions between Petroleum Concessions Ltd., who have nominated as their representative Major Holmes, whom they under stand to be well known throughout the Persian Gulf, and the particular Excellency to whom the letter is being addressed. We trust that when these discussions take place they may eventuate in mutually satisfactory results, and in the meantime we shall continue to have the pleasure of paying the monthly sums agreed. We anticipate that in due course the Excellency will receive confirmation of the position from the Political Resident. The procedure we have indicated above has the approval of the India Office, subject to your prior consultation with the Political Resident.' Yours sincerely./ 14'S'i /C^4 / Jf'l T „ COPY SENT BY AIR MAIL INDIA OFFICE, ’k/^ fc U Q P.Z.946/1936. Air Mail. LOKDOiT, S.W.l . 7th February, 1936. Wlth relerence to my letter of 31st January, P.Z. 677/36, and previous correspondence regarding the Dated 30th pr0p0sals cf Fetro leum Concessions Limited, I enclose copy, January. with six enclosures, of the Company's reply to our official — letter 01 12th December. Copy is also enclosed of a demi-official letter which I sent to Skliros on 4th February, and his reply dated 6 th February. 2. We shall of course be consulting you further, after obtaining the preliminary views of the other Departments of His Majesty's Government, regarding the various draft concessions enclosed with the letter of 30th January from Petroleum Concessions Limited. 3. The point on which I want to consult you at the moment is the procedure in regard to the approval of the options already obtained by the Anglo Iranian Oil Company from the Sheikhs of the Trucial Coast. The original proposal/ The Hon'ble Lieutenant Colonel T.C.W.Fowle, C.B.E., BUSHIRE.proposal oi Petroleum Concessions Limited in their letter of C4-ch October was that they should take transfer of thes options from the Anglo-iranian Oil company, and we have signified that we would approve the grant of the options and their Transfer on the conditions set out in paragraph 5 of our letter to Petroleum Concessions Limited of 12th December. The two Companies now propose a somewhat different procedure - yi_z., that the options should not be transferred, because for technical reasons (presumably the wording of the option agreements) they are not transf ei aole, and suggest that the approval of the opening of negotiations for actual concessions might be given at the same time as approval of the options. Skliros and Lefroy called here on 6 th February, and I explained to them that it may be some little time before approval can be given to the opening of negotiations for actual concessions on the lines of the draft concessions which they have sent us. In accordance with paragraph 5(d) of our letter of 12th December approval has yet to be given to the commencement of negotiations for actual concessions, and though it is probable that we shall be able to give it, the question has yet to be decided in consultation with/3. With the other Departments and yourself, and might take a little time to consider from the point of view of the possible commitments which would be involved in the eventual grant of concessions. ( Two points which might have to be considered are, for example, the southern boundary of the Abu Dhabi concession, and the general principles which we might have to get clear in our own minds in advance in regard to the sort of provisions that should be made for the protection of the concessionaire. I dare say there will he no great difficulty on either point. Skliros suggested at our talk on 6th February that the southern boundary of the concessions might be ieit indeterminate and said that he saw no reason why the Company should not agree that any operations to work a concession would be confined within whatever distance of the coast we pleased. But these poinus have to be considered.) I informed Skliros and Lefroy that we would let them have an official reply co the Company's letter as soon as possible, but that there must be some little delay on account of the necessity of consulting 1 the other authorities concerned. Meanwhile it is probable that Holmes may be able to fillm time by starting work in regard to the Bahrein concession and perhaps visiting Muscat, though he will not make any start at all until we intorm Petroleum Concessions Limited that he may do so. 4. Now with reference to the procedure in regard to to he existing options* thene seen in no j - IiUie seem b0 be two alternatives - (1) to approve the grant of the options to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company at once, on that Company agreeing to conditions (a), (b) and (d) and the Sheikhs concerned agreeing to condition (c); (2) to postpone approval of the options (a course -go which the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company have no objection) until we ai u in a position to approve the opening of negotiations for actual concessions; then to approach the Sheikhs in regard to condition (c), to explain to them bhe proposal that negotiations should be opened by Petroleum Concessions Limited, and then approve at the same cime both the options and. the opening of these iurther negotiations. The second alternative seems to have the merit of making one bite at the cherry with regard to the Sheikhs. It will in any case presumably be necessary for someoneto explain to the Sheilfcs how it ooaos about that, though thS Angio-Iranian Oil Company which obtained the options, it is Petroleum Concessions Limited which is negotiating lor concessions. it will, 0 f course, primarily be for the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company representatives in the Gulf to do this, and we understand mat they will be instructed to introduce Holmes and give the necessary explanation, but it will perhaps also be desirable that you, when the time comes, should inform thu Sheikhs bhac His Majesty's Government approve the opening of negotiations under the options by Petroleum Concessions Limited through Holmes, and that it will be understood that any concession concluded can only be granted subject to the approval of His Majesty's Government. As&gt; therefore, it will probably be desirable co approach the Sheikhs at the time when Holmes opens his noigot.i aliens, you may think it the simplest and least troublesome course to postpone till then the approach to them in regard to the approval of the options and condition (e). Could you kindly lot us know by telegraph which course you think preferable from your point of vie?/? 5 ./V 6 . 5, We are assuLainr. in v-inr-r xo-o^ J-Xl v lev/ O irrmr’ -j- ,,-] _ „ UJ - - our telegram of 4th I “ 0 ‘ aOr ' ”°- 9S6 - ,tot &gt;»« »» t0 tt0 omployment oP „ tto loa „ Wual t0 6o by the company with the negotiations. Since this was written Lefroy telephones that his Company are advised by Elkington that they should explain to the Sheikhs forthwith the present position in regard to the options and the proposal which is being made to His Majesty's Government that their affiliated company, Petroleum Concessions Ltd., should negotiate concessions. The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company are instructing Elkington to act accordingly, subject to your prior approval of the messages to be sent to the Sheikhs. I do not think that this development greatly affects the choice between the two alternatives suggested above in regard to our own procedure, since when the proposal that P.C.L. should open negotiations for concessions has been approved by it will still no doubt be necessary or desirable that you should inforai the Sheikhs that this is the case, (Sd.)

Sir, As you are aware, we have for some months past been negotiating with the rulers of the Trucial Coast for 'two year options' over territories under their control. These negotiations have throughout been on behalf of our allied company, Petroleum Concessions Ltd., in which we hold 2^% of the share capital. We have hitherto succeeded in obtaining such options over the territories of the rulers of Ras-al-Khaimah, A1 Ajman, Sharjah, Dubai and Abu Dhabi. The text of the letters exchanged with the ruler of A1 Ajman has not yet reached us, and we have instructed our local representatives in the Persian Gulf to withdraw from further discussions with the ruler of Um-al-Qawain. For your information we send you copies of the following documents as we have received them from our representatives in Abadan: 1. (a) Letter from the !puler of Ras-al-Shairaah dated the 29th Rabi 1354. (b) Our letter of the 8th August 3.935* under reference 72-H/7, addressed to the fruler of Ras-al-5haimah. 2. (a) Our letter dated the 24th September 1955 to the ruler of Sharjah. (b) The reply of the ruler of Sharjah on the 26th September 1935* under reference No. 226. (c) Our acknowledgment of the ±uler f s letter No. 226, under date 28th October 1935 reference 145/7* 3* (a) Our letter of the 19 th October 1935 to the ruler of Dubai.

(a) Our letter dated the 5 th January 1936 to the ruler of Abu Dhabi. (b) A reply under the same date from the ruler ox Abu Dhabi. (c) Our letter to the ruler of Abu Dhabi dated tne 21st January 1936 , under reference 304/7.1 % - 2 - We will in due course send you a copy of the letters exchanged with the ruler of A1 AJman, so soon as we have received them from Abadan. / We understand from Petroleum Concessions Ltd. that you have approved a transfer to that company of our above option agreements, subject to your approval of the terms of the option agreements, copies of all of which have been sent by our Abadan representatives to the Honourable Political Resident. Major Holmes has been selected by Petroleum Concessions Ltd. as their negotiator in the Persian Gulf, and it is proposed by that company that he shall initiate negotiations under cover of our option agreements, subject to your approval of the terms of the option agreements and of any concession proposed to be negotiated. The procedure which we visualise as necessary to put Major Holmes in a position to initiate discussions with the various rulers is as follows: (a) Our representative in Abadan will hand to Major Holmes a letter addressed to each ruler individually, introdueihg Major Holmes as the representative of Petroleum Concessions Ltd., a British company in which we are partners with other companies of standing and repute. Petroleum Concessions Ltd. desire to negotiate with the ruler for a concession covering a longer / period than our option, and we trust that His Excellency and Major Holmes will be able to come to mutually satisfactory terms. (b) The Political Resident will inform each ruler individually: (i) of the approval of His Majesty's Government to the options granted by the ruler to the D'Arcy Exploration Company Ltd. (ii) that His Majesty’s Government approves the initiationof negotiations between Petroleum Concessions Ltd. under that option through Major Holmes, and trusts that the ruler and Major Holmes may be able to come to mutually satisfactory arrangements which in all cases are subject to the approval of H.M.G. (c) Pending the conclusion of a definite agreement between Petroleum Concessions Ltd. and any of the rulers in question, we shall continue responsible for and make the periodical payments due under the option agreements to the rulers. Subject to your approval, we should not propose at this stage to make any formal transfer of the options as a whole to Petroleum Concessions Ltd., but consider that with the introductions from ourselves as option holders and from Colonel Fowle as the representative of His Majesty*s Government, no serious difficulty in achieving recognition should be experienced by Major Holmes. It should be clear however that we are not by this procedure desirous of implying that we claim any beneficial interests in these options otherwise than as shareholders in Petroleum Concessions Ltd. We are sending a copy of this letter to Petroleum Concessions Ltd. for their information, and we shall be glad to know if our views as to procedure meet with your approval.3 P.2. 759/36. IKDIA OFFICE, WKIT 3 EA.LL, S.W.l, /tli Feljraary, 1936 . Dear Mr. Skliros, We have received your official letter of 30th .January, enclosing a copy of draft concessions for the Kowcit Neutral Zone, Bahrein, Has al Khaimah, Ahu Dhabi * Debai and Sharjah. 2. v/e shall be sending an official reply to your letter after the necessary consultation with the other Departments concerned and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I am sending you this demi-official letter because tnere is a point of procedure in regard to the Trucial Coast negotiations which it seems desirable to get settled. 3* The Anglo-Irani an Oil Company (or the D’Arcy exploration Company) have obtained options from the Sheikhs of Ras al Khaimah, Sharjah, Debai and (as we learn from a telegram from the Political Resident of 1st February) Abu Dhabi and Ajman. The first step is to give approval to these options on the conditions set out J* Skliros, Esq. , Petroleum Concessions, Ltd. , City Gate House, E.C.2.m paragraph 5 of my letter of 12th December. One of th ° oC condl0lon&amp; &gt; ZDS. , (c), has to he agreed to hy the Sheiklis concerned, and it will he desirable that the position in regard to the options should he clear to tn3ifl Wh6n ::;olonel Fowle approaches them in regard to condition (c). for this reason would it not he convenient that as a first step - before Colonel Fowle approaches the Sheikhs - your Company should take over tne options from the Anglo-I rani an Oil Company and that tne position should he explained to the Sheikhs hy that Company’s representative in the Gulf or perhaps hy Colonel Fowle, when he approaches the Sheikhs about condition (c) ? We have not got a copy of all tnese option agreements, hut we have one of that concluded between the Sheikh of Ras al Khairnah and the D’Arcy Exploration Company, in which I see that it is provided chat the Sheikh will not negotiate with any other than that Company with regard to exploring for oil during the two years'* period of the option. If your Company now takes over the existing options at once and it is explained to the Sheikhs that this being done, the position would appear to he simplified. Colonel Fowle would/ n : -ii ywould not have to approach the Sheikh twice in regard to condition (c) - once as affecting the Anglo-iranian Oil Company and again as afiectmg your Company. Moreover the approval of the options obtained by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and of their transfer to your Company could be given at the same time. 4. ,vhen the options have been approved, we shall then have to consider the question of the approval of the opening of negotiations for actual concessions from the Sheikhs concerned, as foreseen in (d) of paragraph 5 of my letter of ISth December, This question (in connection with which the draft concessions you have forwarded would be taken into consideration) must, I fear, necessarily occupy some little time, though we shall expedite it as much as possible. I am therefore wondering whether it would not be better to postpone for the present Major Holmes’s departure for the Gulf until the question of entering into negotiations- for actual concessions from the Trucial Coast Sheikhs is further advanced. 5./S.

It is S dlffioul t question whether the terms of an actual concession should be embodied in the option agreement to be offered to the Sheikh of Koweit, since the concession itself if granted, would have to be obtained and held from Ibn Saud aluO, o.nd it might perhaps be a more convenient course to wait until it is possible to seek approval for negotiations with him as well as the Sheikh of Koweit before drawing up tne terms of an actual concession.

Sir, 1 apologise for the delay in acknowledging your letter of the 12th ueceruber, 19ou (f.8856/35j, a delay occasioned by the desire to send with this reply copies of the terms which it is proposed to offer to the various Rulers for concessions on their respective territories. (2/ I assume that the conditions which His majesty^ G-overnment would attach to their recognition of the •^concessions in which my Company is interested are conditions similar 'to those embodied in the separate Agree ments concluded between the India Office and the Anglo-Iranian Oil Co. in respect of the Qatar Concession, and such - or similar - conditions my Com pany will accept, subject only to the observation that the refinery obliga tion if applied separately to each one of the concessions may introduce an altogether uneconomical burden. (3, 1 Refineries . Hine concessions are involved, i.e. Neutral Zone, Bahrein, six on the Trucial Coast and Qatar; some of these must be barren, but assuming that oil were found on two, or even three, of them, it by no means j follows that the amount of oil found on each concessionary area could support a refinery. I would, therefore, propose that in accepting as applicable to all thes^ concessions the provisions of Clause 9 of the Agreement of 5th June, between His Majesty’s Government and the Anglo-Persian Oil Co. Ltd., relative- to Qatar, there should be an understanding that not more than one reiinery gS is in question for the Persian Gulf area. (4) I enclose, in duplicate, copies of draft concessions for the Koweit . Neutral Zone, Bahrein and the Truciai Coast. The Neutral Zone and Bahren drafts differ somewhat from the Trucial Coasi- drains. j.he drc~i.to _or n Ajman and Umm-al-Quaim will be similar to the drafts for the other areas ijf ; the Trucial Coast; the amounts payable will differ, but the oo-xer con f j tions are precisely the same in all the Trucial Coast dra-its.THE NAME OF GOD THE MERC IFUL This is an Agreement made at day of ... on the in the year 1936, corresponding to the day of 1S5... between His Excellency Shaikh Shakboot Bin Sultan Bin Za-id in the exercise of his powers as Ruler of Abu-Thabi, Arabia, on his own behalf and on behalf of and in the name of his heirs and successors in whom is or shall be vested for the time being the responsibility for the control and government of the State of Abu-Thabi (hereinafter called ''The Shaikh' ) of the one part and Petroleum Concessions, Limited, a Company registered in Great Britain under the Companies Act, 1929, (hereinafter called 'The Company') its successors and assigns of the second part.

It seems possible, however, from what Skliros saio to Rende^that P.C.L. may propose to negotiate fresh 5-year options; if they dp such a proposal will of course have to be further considered, and m that case it might be best to deal first, and separately, with the approval of the existing options.

At the request of Sir John Cadman I had an interview this morning with Mr. Skliros, Chairman of Petroleum Concessions. Limited, which is the new Company formed by the Iraq Petroleum Company to acquire and develop concessions in the areas, other than Iraq, within the so called 'Red Line'. 2. Mr. Skliros began by giving me a detailed account of the genesis, activities and objects of the new Company. He told me little or nothing that I did not already know. He explained that one of the main reasons which had led to the formation of the new Company, which only differed from the old one in not having an Iraqi Director on the Board, was that the French authorities had objected to any Company with an Iraqi Director operating in Syria. This is no doubt true, but he admitted that it was also to the obvious advantage of the various groups concerned to keep the Iraqis out of their other activities, in the Gulf and elsewhere. Mr. Skliros then described the activities of Petroleum Concessions Limited in Qatar, Abu Dhabi and the other Trucial Sheikhdoms, and explained that their policy was to secure a series of 5 -year options, by which they v/ould obtain permission to carry out exploration for 5 years against a fixed annual payment, retaining an option at the end of that period to conclude a concession on agreed terms. Thi^ meant that there need be no further negotiations about the. terms of any concession should the Company decide to take up its/ Vi 1 ' iill N r,n ». op„on. B »t ! ^ ^ ^ particular Burry t. Uauaiup ol i lo ^ or „„„ ^ &gt;m merely .iah.a to pr.veut otter concern, coMng m , M developing a nuisance value. 3. Mr. Skliros added that Petroleum Concessions Limited also hoped to conclude an agreement on similar terms with the Sultan of Muscat, where the prospects were favourable. 4 * They might also consider trying for something on the same lines in Turkey, whither he might himself he proceeding in a few months' time. The Turks had, however, made it clear that they would not deal with any mere group of financiers who were taking up a concession to sell it again at a profit. They would only deal with a concern capable of and ready to exploit any oil that might be found. 5. Mr. Skliros then gave me a very depressing account of the failure of the I.P.G. to take up either the Bahrein or the Hasa concessions. He explained that the Bahrein concession was originally taken up by the Gulf Oil Company of California, which was then a constituent group of the I.P.C., and which, therefore, in accordance with the provisions of the 'Red Line' Agreement, offered the concession to the I.P.C., who, however, refused to take it up, not believing that there was any oil- in Bahrein. As a result the concession had eventually gone to a rival group, the Standard Oil Company of California, and the I.P.C. were reduced to trying to obtain a concession for themselves at greatly enhanced terms for the small area in Bahrein not covered by the existing concession. now J I * ii n VXUtJ I,/ jej 6 . He also explained that Un-in-,. t„ a tmt i^ajor longrigg, who had been sent out to Jedda by the I.P.C. at the time of the Hasa negotiations, had obtained from Xbn Saud a clear statement of his terms, i.e. £50,000 gold in a cash payment in advance and a royalty of 4s. gold a ton on any oil eventually won. mt. okliros had apparently made a great effort to induce his Board to agree to these terms, but they had, in spite of his advice, to the contrary, come to the conclusion that Ibn iiaud was merely bargaining, and had instructed Major iongrigg not to rise above £30,000. As a result the concession had oeen lost to the standard Gil Company of California and most of the present troubles and difficulties had followed. I entirely agree with Mr. Skliros and concurred in his view that it was most unfortunate that the l.P.C. had lost this opportunity. (Incidentally had the I.P.C. obtained both the Hasa and the Qatar concessions we might have avoided all our present trouble about the Qatar-Saudi frontier - though I did not, of course, say this to Mr. Skliros). 7* Mr. Skliros then came round to what was the main object of his visit - the possibility oi his Company obtaining of the interview separately. 34&amp;/2bu/yij.Yu jritannic House, Finsbury Circus, London, E.C, 2. 17 th Januaryj 1956 .

I have passed a copy of this letter to Skliros, who is actively engaged in discussing with Major Holmes the negotiation of further agreements in the Persian Gulf, on behalf of Petroleum Concessions Ltd. In view of Holmes 1 engagement for these discussions we do not here propose to concern our- selves any further/than as shareholders in 'P.C.L.' in negotiations in this area. 9 I understand from Skliros that he will shortly be writing to you about the negotiations which Holmes Is to carry on, and in reply to your letter of the 12th December last, of which you were good enough to send me a copy. Abadan have sent us on for instructions a copy of a letter from the Resident detailing the conditions to be accepted by the Company prior to the Residents approach to the Shaikhs.

My dear Lefroy, Jill you please refer to correspondence relating to the question of oil on the Arabian side of the Persian Gulf, ending with your letter of the 16th December. \ou will remember that in my letter to Mr. Skliros of the 12th i ecember, 1935&gt; P-2. 8856/35&gt; (a copy of which was enclosed in my letter to you of the same date), it was stated that His Majesty’s Government had no objection to Petroleum Concessions Limited applying to the Sultan of Muscat for a concession, on the understanding that any concession granted would be subject to the conditions considered necessary to safeguard Government interests. The Sultan of Muscat has recently informed the Political Agent that he is anxious to have a thorough oil survey carried out in his State. This information may perhaps be of interest to you and Mr. Skliros. Do you know whether the Anglo-I rani an Oil Company or Petroleum Concessions Limited are intending to open negotiations in the near future with the Sultan (for exanple by applying for an option on the lines of those already obtained on the Trucial Coast)?

We have just heard from Abadan that the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi has been away hunting and that they anticipate an early renewal of negotiations with him for a similar option. Regarding Qatar, I should anticipate that a separate subsidiary for this area is likely to be formed by Petroleum Concessions Ltd., and it would be to that subsidiary that we should contemplate transferring our concession. So far as anything is definitely settled among 'the Groups', 'P.C.L.' will not operate concessions but will seek for them and form separate companies for the operation! of any concessions obtained.

Replies have been received from the F.O., Admiralty, Petroleum Dept, and from the A.M., to whom I also wrote, concurring in our suggestions. Col. Fowle has also concurred by telegraph. 7L ^ /P fysje? 7 A draft letter to Mr. Bkliros is accordingly submitted, together with a d.o. draft letter to Col. Fowle, asking him to take the necessary action locally in regard to the three options already obtained by the A.I.O.C. at Has al Khaimah, Sharjah and Debai, and a draft d.o. letter to Mr. Lefroy of the A.I.O.C. The Admiralty ask that a reference should be made to the importance attached to the erection of a refinery or refineries. The relevant clause in the Qatar ^ (between the A.I.O.C. and H.M.G.) to which they refer was as follows, and there was a similar clause in the agreement between the Koweit uil Coy. and H.M.G..- H The Company declare that it is their intention, should they consider that commercial conditions justify it, to erect a refinery in Qatar. If and when the Company is satisfied that commercial production is assured, the Company agrees to examine with His Majesty's Government the question of establishing a refinery in Qatar of suitable type and capacity.' This clause, of coarse, does not in any way bind the Coy. the best that we could obtain after/ to erect a refinery, but wasI) . after prolonged negotiations; the Coys, were naturally reluctant to commit themselves on the subject. .«e shall probably find equal reluctance ^ the l^^of Petroleum^ Concessions Ltd. to commit thems.elyes to the erection of a refinery/, bat there is no harm m making a mention at this stage, as the Admiralty desire, of the importance which is attached to this question, though it cannot arise until an actual concession is applied for, and must then be subject to discussion with the Coy.; t-he Admiralty have been somewhat inelastic in pressing for a stronger refinery clause; the importance to the iia^vy of local refining is recognised, but it may be impossible in connection with these small concessions to induce any coy. to undertake expenditure which may be totally uneconomic- Fortunately the Bahrein Petroleum Coy. is now erecting a refinery at Bahrein (where in time of war we could certainly reckon on requisitioning the supply), and this, which is in addition to the A.I.O.C. refinery at Abadan, may go far to meet the Admiralty requirements.

With reference to your letter of November 4th, 'l 1 - No. PZ.7763/35, enclosing copy of a letter from the Managing Director of the Iraq Petroleum Company, concerning the formatio of a new Company known as Petroleum Concessions Limited, as a subsidiary Company of the Iraq Petroleum Company to acouire oil concessions in the Persian Gulf area, I had, just before I received your letter, been informed by Mr. Skliros of this new development, on much the same lines as in his letter to you. We had rather hoped at one period, in view of our special interests in the Persian Gulf, that an arrangement might have been come to within the Iraq Petroleum Company by which the Anglo-I rani an Oil Company and the Shell Group might have been allowed to take up some of these concessions. The formation of the new Company makes it clear that the French and American groups have not been willing to agree to this. E C. Walton, Esc. , C.B. , tndia Office, ^hi tehall, 3.W. 1. X copy sekt :r: ,\;n mailWhile we may from some points of view regret this decision, the new development has the advantage that we can, I think, now be sure that a Company with very substantial British interests wil l he available to counter the quite serious threat of further penetration in this area by purely American concerns such as the , Standard Oil Company of California, and as I know of no substantial purely British Company which is prepared to go into this area, this is all to the good. You refer in the third paragraph of your letter to the nossibility of an arrangement between the Iraq Petroleum Company and the Standard of California in the marketing of Bahrein oil removing the deadlock in the Kuweit Meutral Zone. But recent efforts to come to an arrangement have broken down. This, I think, may have the result of stimulating the action of the new Company in these Persian Gulf areas. I am interested to see that Mr. Skliros is inclined to take up an option for the remainder of Bahrein. There may not be much left that is very valuable on the main island but perhaps the shallow waters and other islands may be worth investigating. Subject to necessary safeguards such as you refer to in paragraph V of your letter, I think we should encourage the Company to go ahead with their plans.

My dear Walton, In reply to your letter P.Z.7763/35 dated 4th November, 1935, enclosing a copy of a letter from Mr. okliros about the proposed procedure for dealing vi tn oil concessions in certain areas in the Persian Gulf, I write to say that the Admiralty are mainly concerned in the matter of safeguards. This question, although not at present urgent, is bound sooner or later to arise if oil is discovered. We note that Mr. Skliros stated in his letter of the 24th October that the provisions of the Qatar Government Agreement would be generally acceptable to the new Company. As you know, this agreement (like that for Koweit) deals with the question of a refinery in a some what unsatisfactory manner by a mere declaration ol intention on the part of the Company to erect a refinery if commercial conditions justify it, and to examine the matter with H.M. Government when commercial production is assured. Every new concession granted in countries ■bordering the Persian Gulf accentuates the importance of the refinery question and it would be most unfortunate if the greater part of the territory were developed without any binding obligation on the part of the Company to build at least one reftaery. We do not think that the relaxation of our requirements in this respect in the Qatar and...... J.C. Walton, Esq., C.B#, M#C.&gt; India Office, S. W. 1. DU] g ° py of U 1 l!•&gt; ana Koweit concessions, in each case after long discussion with the companies, is a good reason for accepting the same position without further discussion in any future concessions. W e feel, therefore, that new draft concessions should contain the approved standard refinery clause and that any relaxation should he agreed to only When good reasons are forthcoming. u-e do not suggest that there is any necessity to raise the matter in this form with the Company at the present stage, hut in view of Mr. Skliros* reference to the Qatar agreement we think it desirable that the Company should be reminded that the erection of a refinery or refineries in territory under British influence in the Persian Gulf is one of the prime desiderata of H.M. Government. Perhaps, therefore, you ?/ould be good enough to include such a reference in your reply. Apart from the foregoing we have no comments to offer on your proposed action.

My dear W T alton, When I last came to see you with Skliros you made certain reservations as to the policy of His Majesty 1 s Government in allowing any exoloration on the Trucial Coast. In this connection it may interest you to know that we have heard from Abadan, through Bahrein, that the Shaikh of Ras-al-Khaimah during a recent visit to Bahrein spent some three hours with the representatives of the Bahrein Petroleum Company, during which he showed them n some stones which he had brought down with him”. It is said that he was told by the Bahrein Petroleum officials that there were indications of the existence of oil as well as copper in his country. Our Chief Geologist reminds us that 'many limestones have a foetid smell which may not have any practical significance”. In a later report it was stated that the Manager of the Bahrein Petroleum Company had referred the question of obtaining a concession in Ras-al-Khaimah to his principals in the U.S.A. We are also informed tnat the Shaudi has ^,one into partnership with a cousin of Haji Yusuf Kanoo, our agent in Bahrein, with the intention of boring artesian wells in his territory, and that a dril-ing r g ii shipped to Ras-al-Khaimah from Bahrein.a letter in which ^ writes? «? f ki »fton at Abadan you in connection w^tHur isl^aX^V 0 a ?f? ss ' to know if the Comnany wishes W ° uW like it is not free of oil^ red cfay^d other^SSal^,' 3 Abadan are asking the Polifinni S.

These enclosures are, I think, fairly self-explanatory. You will see that the reply which it is proposed to send to Petroleum Concessions, Ltd., provides safeguards at three stages. First, in approving the options which have been obtained or may be obtained by the A.i.o.C. from the rulers of the crucial Coast, we would lay down the conditions suggested in para. 7 of my letter. Secondly, in accordance with these conditions it would be necessary for the Coy, to obtain the further approval of H.M.G. before opening negotiations with any of the Trucial Sheikhs for the grant of a concession. Thirdly, if sucn negotiations take place we should, before^ approving any concession agreement , negotiated/1 Y in negotiated, impose such conditions as were necessary to safeguard Govt, interests in connection with the working of the concession. These last conditions would *• ® ' be incorporated in a separate agreement between the Coy. and H.L .G. A separate Govt, agreement of this character was concluded m the case of the Koweit and Katar oil concessions. I enclose copy of A/ww £ /}Poc rdm the Katar Agreement^and its connected / concession agreement, which are referred to in the third para, of the letter from Mr. Skliros and which show the sort of machinery which has been devised for securing whatever Govt, safeguards are considered necessary v the case of any particular concession.

When the time came they would, - ke formulated m consultation with the Air inistry and the other Gepts. concerned. !

Davis did not take place for the reasons stated in Major Holmes's letter of 24th October below. On 23rd October Mr. J. Skliros, Managing Director of the I.P.C., and Mr. Lefroy of the A.I.O.C. called to explain a scheme for acr^airing options and concessions for a company called Petroleum Concessions, Lta., which is the I.P.C. under another name, except that there is no Iraqi Govt, director. These proposals are briefly stated in Mr. Skliros’s letter of 24th October below and in the draft d.o. letter to the F.O. , Petroleum Dept, and Admiralty attached. It will be best, subject to the concurrence of those Depts. , to deal with the proposals of Petroleum Concessions, Ltd. in the manner suggested m the draft letter, which is self- explanatory. * ^proposed procedure for acquiring options, and subsequently possible concessions, for oil in certain areas in the Persian Gulf. Certain points in this letter were more (3) S.A. Seal, Esn., ADMIRALTY, S.W. 1. fully explained at an interview which I had with Mr. Skliros and Mr. Lefroy of the A.I.O.C. on 23rd October. 1 , The oteAftek-o-f forming a company - Petroleum Concessions, Ltd. - separate from the I.P.C. is, I understood, merely that the latter coy. has an Iraqi Govt, director, and it is not considered necessary or desirable that he should participate in undertakings solely concerned with the acquisition of concessions in countries outside Iraq. 3 As regards the Koweit neutral zone, Petroleum Concessions, Ltd. , are aware of the position of deadlock resulting from the commitment to the Standard Oil of California, but they think that by the offer of an arrangement to facilitate the marketing of the Bahrein Petroleum: Co.'s production they may obtain the necessary leverage to induce the California Co. to relinquish their stranglehold on Ibn Baud's partr^Ww^ intei'CTst in the Koweit neutral zone- With reference to the unallotted part/of Bahrein, Mr. Lefroy did not think that this would be of value to anyone, oat Fr. Skliros was inclined to think uhau it might be worth while to obtain an option with a view to its examination. So far as I know, we have not entered into commitmenijs with anyone regarding this area, so that il ls presumably open to any coy. which desires to do so to apply ^o the Sheikh xor a concession (subject, of coarse, to H.M.G. approval). r On the Trucial Coast the A.I.Q.C. (or the E^rcy Exploration Coy.) have, as you know, already obtained two-year options, subject to H.M.G.’s approval, at Has al Khaimah and Sharjah. Mr. Lefroy stated that they have just obtained a similar option at Debai. They are also in the field for options at Abu Dhabi, Ajman and Umm-al- Qaiwain. The A.I.Q.C. would go forward with their pending negotiations, but any concessions for which they have acquired or may acquire /w/; ^ J ^ options on the Trucial Coast would betaken . by Petroleum Concessions, Ltd. //The reference to the Pirate Coast ' is a geographical misunderstanding. Petroleum Concessions, Ltd., might interest itself in the possibilities-of Muscat, where we have not committed ourselves to anyone and the field is consequently open. ! I stated that certain preliminary V conditions to the approval of options t',. Draft P' r ^ Pz rffr y tjir V'-g , ( J uK1 Draft Paper. kjJ Department. 3761 5000 5.35 the iracial Coast (which had been discussed with Fowle during his deputation) would be required by viz.: \ illL-_arVia the Company: - (a) that any geologist or employee who visits any of the Trucial Sheikhdoms for the purpose of exploring a &amp; &gt;VUa ^ the option should be of British nationality; (b) that the exploring party in their travels would be definitely guided by the views of the Resident as to where they should go. Vis-a-vis the Sheik h;- (c) that the Sheikh concerned should give a definite guarantee in writing that he would be responsible for the safety of the exploring^party. I added that another 'condition to the approval of an option would be that further approval by H.M.G. would be necessary before negotiations for an actual concession were entered into with the Sheikh concerned. f The question of our future policy on the Trucial Coast, which was discussed by the Middle East Committee on 24th September, has, of course, a certain relevance to the question whether in this backward and uncivilised area the/ r! #2! illthe acquisition of oil concessions by any coy., of whatever nationality, ought to be encouraged or permitted, ihe result of the meeting in regard to general policy vvas somewhat inconclusive, but there is, I think, nothing in theft? conclusions, such as they were, to suggest that we oughu a at a definite decision to sterilise the iru Coast so far as oil is concerned. Indeed, the trend of the discussion was rather m t opposite direction, and Fowle himself, mve cial he though he is averse from any new pronouncement I of general policy, has always taken the view that in regard to oil we can hardly impose an absolute veto on concessions which the Sheikhs may wish to grant, though specially careful conditions to safeguard the tn**- /£V' interests 1 of H.M.Gh and limit commitments would be necessary. In any case, by making the actual commencement of negotiations for| a concession,apart from the conditions on UsilA Ih which it should be granted, ^subject to U M H I n jL-J\ / Jt ^ t s approval, we ensure that each case is kept open for decision by when the time comes, in the light of considerat of general policy and of the degree of commitment which the grant of any concessip would involve. i V 0n the ^estion of nationality, it be Reen that the nationa l complexion of i-ions nDepartment. Petroleum Concessions, Ltd., is identical with that of the I.P.C. It was explained to me that Petroleum Concessions, Lta., would probably beget separate companies to exploit the seveial areas in which they mi^it be successful in obtaining concessions, but that such are the national jealousies on the part of the non-British elements in the I.P.C. than there is no chance of such companies being formed on a basis of a larger proportion of British ownership than that in the I.P.C. itself. As, however, the areas mentioned (apart, possibly, from the Koweit neutral zone) are within the Red Line agreement, it seems necessary to be content with the I.P.C. proportion of British shareholding, since no British coy. outside the I.P.C. has shown a serious interest in these areas. Holmes has indeed been angling during the last few months for the interest of an all- British group (which, however, had no experience of oil concessions), but I ^ hear) from him that his negotiations have definitely broken down. /o, If the (1) Petroleum Dent, and the 2) Foreign Offi£&amp; 3) Admiralty other Depts. concerned and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf agree, we would propose to inform Petroleum Concessions, Ltd., as follows:- (a‘ - I ^ a (a) On the Trucial Coast, subject to v ' nnj the conditions stated above, w€ approve the options already granted by the Sheikhs of Ras al Khaimah, Sharjah and Debai, am. any options that nay be granted by oth Sheikhs. If it is desired daring the currency of the option to enter h o-o negotiations with the Sheikh concerned fc a concession, the prior approval of H.M.G. will be required before such negotiations are opened. In the event of such approval being given, the conditions to safeguard Govt, interests which would have to be attached to any concession obtained would have- to be considered r ^ . (b) In Bahrein and Muscat there is no objection to Petroleum Concessions, Ltd., applying to the Halers concerned, on the understanding that any concession granted; would be subject to the conditions considered necessary to safeguard British 'polit-ieal interests. (c) As regards the Koweit neutral zone, application may be made to the Sheikh of Koweit for an option for his part- interest in the zone, on the understanding; that, if it should later become possible for tne Coy. to okWin a concession from him and Ibn Baud jointly, the prior approval qf H.M.G. would have to be sought before the j Coy ’ ^^^d into negotiations with th&amp;y~ llulers/\ 3761 5000 5.35 (Sgd.) hi.

Could you kindly let us know whether you concur m the proposals which are also made in the letter to the other Depts. concerned? As regards para. fi(c) of that letter, it seems sufficient to inform the Company in these terms of the preliminary condition to be required of the Sheikhs, though in addressing the latter this condition could be made full and precise in the manner suggested m your note of 3rd October which you recorded here. t f]&lt;ruu . 4 r n 1 11 I V 1 ■J i 'V Sir, X sun directed by the Secretary of State for India to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of 24th October regarding the proposals of Petroleum Concessions, Ltd., to seek oil concessions in certain areas bordering on the Persian Gulf.

Lear Mr. Walton, In reference to the interview and discussions I had with you and Colonel Fowle just prior to the latter T s departure for the Persian Gulf, I wish to inform you that the scheme for forming a company entirely British in its composition has failed. Sir Edmund Lavis and the Board of the Anglo-American Corporation of South Africa did not reach agreement as to certain points regarding the adyisaoility of having one of the large Oil Groups in with them. I interviewed - on 'behalf of Sir jidmund Lavis - two of the large Oil Groups but, as they were not inclined to entertain a participation in any such company in the circumstances I see no chance of any further steps being taken in the matter of forming an all British company.

That speech had hitherto been accepted as the ruling authority in matters affecting the policy or Kis Majesty's Government on the Trucial coast 5 and as a basis the Air Ministry fully accepted it still. There were 9 how ever 9 incon sistencies between trie policy contained in that speech and the policy now recommended by Colonel Fowle s and these inconsistencies must 5 in the Air Ministry’s view 9 he resolved.

Air* Vice-Marshal Courtney pointed out that conditions had changed since Lord Cur son made this speech, and said that as regards the first point which he had quoted from Colonel Fowle's despatch, it was tne view of the Air Ministry that, if British interests were threatened owing to any developments in the internal affairs of a Trucial Sheikhdom, His Majesty's Government should intervene. Air power now permitted His Majesty's u-oveminent to intervene, or prevent hostilities, on land, if they wished to do so, and he suggested that his Majesty s Government should make it clear to the Crucial oheikus that they could and would intervene by sea, air or even landif necessary. As the safety of the air route to the Far East «as now the principal British interest on the Trucial coast, the Air Ministry had taken the initiative in asking that the matter should 'be considered by tue 8 ub-Commi 11 e e. he would tame the recent incident at Debai as an i rnionol ••'owlet in his despatch, had represented then taken by his Majesty's Government did It was, however, to oe that the action t not const i tut e int era er eric e. assumed that this action was taken because tne ^■ itioh authorities feared that British lives and property might ultimately be threatened, if the quarrel at Debai hadthe E.A.F. petrol store Tn , i. 1 LX oLOxv,. in tha u ease &gt; measures had successfully been taken (viz. 5 a threat to immobilise the — Abu Dhabi pearling fleet) which were designed to affect the people of Abu Dhabi * as well as their Sheikh. No internal interference had been necessary, and the Sheikh, having given his signature to the agreement by which he had allowed the petrol store, had simply been told that he must give effect to it. iviK. itEiDDDL suggested that it might be convenient if he spoke before the discussion progressed any further since a.i' 0 m txie Foreign Ofrice point of view there would, be advan tages in framing the question raised by the Air Ministry in even wider terms than the Air Ministry had employed. While many of the principles enunciated in Lord Cur*zon 1 s speech of 1903 might still be applicable, it seemed essential to recognise that the general situation in the Gulf, particularly from the international point of view, had been completely and fundamentally revolutionised by post-war developments. Lord Curzon f s speech had been made at a time when the Persian Gulf had been virtually a British lake, under unchallenged British control and cut off by almost impassable do sorts from the North and West 0 The Ottoman Empire had proved no serious menace to this position. These was no aviation, tnere was no oil, and there was little xoreign cracie. a. a a r esux c, the limi in-&gt; of His Majesty ? s Government T s action had been set solely by themselves. Tc—day tire f er si an cruli was one Oj. the world’s highways, bordered by strongly nationalist States, whose interest in the G-uli was real and active, and the discovery of oil had led other foreign Powers to take an increasing interest in Gulf affairs. In his view, the time had come, or was at least rapidly approaching, when his Majesty’s Government would no longer be able to maintain1 at Qatar.

COLONEL EOWLE agreed that the e ciiscovery of oil on the Trucial Coast meant that His Majesty's Government must offer ucc ,.ion, making it, of course, conditional on the actual grant of a coricessinn -t-p ^ 4 -, -uncoion. -if oil were not found, it was clear that no guarantee was necessary. ! -..xv. REi-aEL pointed out, however, that in Koweit the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s investigations had failed to find oil which another company had afterwards located. Moreover, in Qatar it had been necessary for His Majesty’s Government to promise the Sheikh protection in return for the grant of the concession without waiting to learn whether any oil was actually found. Even if it were unnecessary to grant protection in return for prospecting licences, this would merely postpone the question for a short period. There followed a general discussion arising from the following hypothetical question: what would he the position of His Majesty’s Government vis-a-vis a foreign Government if, say, a prospecting party of its nationals were killed or otherwise molested on the Trucial Coast by — (a) Saudi Tribesme 11; (b) Tribesmen of one or other Trucial Sheikhdom; - 7 --8- ! .c) Tritesmen of the hinterland ovj- a.aegiance to no Sheikh in particular. ng COliOlTEL PCWL3 maintained that this situation need never arise since no subject of a foreign power could go to the Trucial Coast unless Els Majesty's Government allowed him to do so and that, as regards oil prospectors etc., His Majesty's Government would take steps to ensure tnat any concession on the Trucial Coast went to a British c ompany, 1 . 111 . Riia'JjjHjL pointed out 3 lioweve v } that a Bnitisli companv was not always availahle to compete - particularly in view oi the Oil Agreement of 1SS8 between the various groups of* the Iraq_ Petroleum Company - and that in such circumstances it might be impossible, even if it were desirable, to keep foreign enterprise out. Foreign Governments wished to deal with a responsible authority. Who was at present that authority on the Crucial Coast? Unless His Majesty’s Government were in a position to say that they were ultimately responsible in all respects, some foreign Power or other might take matters into its own hands. It was important that these admittedly hypothetical questions - which might, however, at any moment become acute - should be faced beiore die pressure of foreign enterprise became too gre^t. COLONEL FOWLS said that, as regards aviation, there was already machinery for controlling the Dutch and the french air lines should they decide to use the Arab coasu. As regards foreign air lines, he doubted whether His Majesty's Government had the means to exclude them. This drew from AIR VICE-MARSHAL CGUNTKEY the remark that His Majesty’s Government did not wish to exclude them., but to control the conditions in which they should enter.turning to th9 question of oil dev»i P-sve it Pq , • ' development, COLOIEL POVV 1 E bcive 1 c a s his view thst -p a ? - American engineers were Hnop on the Trueial Coast son - l ' nlted States Government appealed to His Majesty's Government to to, . r 1 „v. r J take action, the 11 gn b course woul ri ^ , ^' ai ' ! -© the nearest i vr o nrl ,.

The Resident, however, still maintained that His Majesty's Government could prevent any ioreign engineer from going to such a place at all. CAPTAIH PHILLIPS said, that the Admiralty were in general agreement with the views of Colonel Powle. They would prefer to see His Majesty's Government keep a free hand by avoiding any unnecessary new commitments. As he understood the nis tory ox this ques tion, the reason for confining guarantees to the sea in the past was that the physical arguments against any guarantee covering land operations had been very strong, whereas protection from the sea was an easy matter. The advent of aeroplanes had undoubtedly made possible many operations which previously could not be undertaken, but he was not convinced that it could be said to-day that they alone could uphold a guarantee by land, and that if we gave such a guarantee there was no chance of our being involved in mili tary operations. The case of the Sheikh of Mohammerah had shewn that guarantees were two-edged, and he thought shat His Majesty’s Government should beware of them. 'In Qatar the offer of a guarantee had clearly been the trump card in the hands of His Majesty’s Government who had thought the offer of it worth While. It would, no doubt, be a trump card in other places too, but, in that event, we should, he thought, be careful not to play it too soon.

MR. 0LAUS0.N said that the India Office we re in general agreement with the views of the Government of India and of Colonel Eowle. Referring to Mr. Rondel’s suggestion that, in their relations with tne Yrucial Coast, His Majesty's Government must now either go backwards or forwards, he indicated that the India Office were ready to advance when and as necessary, but that they saw no adequate reason why His Majesty’s Government should not continue to pursue their present policy. If an oil concession were granted on the Tracial coast, for example, at Ras-al-Kheima, the India Office would not oppose the necessary guarantees of protection being given. As regards foreign penetration of the 1’racial Coast in general, Mr, Clauson observed that while the political control which His Majesty’s Government at present exercised was still -ia-undisputed, it had o.tcn been com/enient for them to be able to describe the Trucn al i „ ^ 1 ruIe - s being ft independent Arab uhei.vno ir. special relations with His Majesty's Government'. 1,0113 tae iehS ’ tne Inaia Office would not wish to exclude tne eventual possibility that control on the Trucial Coast might be tightened up by seme such measure as the placing of a British political agent in one of the Sheikhdoms, but their general policy was one of evolution, ■hLu. rL-:-Ijj_i expressed a feeling that the Air Ministry were perhaps suggesting that fences should be taken before they were reached, THM CHAIRMAN remarked that His Majesty’s Government was of course responsible for providing protection for the Trucial Sheikhs against aggression by Ibn Sand, SIR A, RYAN said that he was concerned with the question of protection only in so far as it meant protection against Ibn Sand, The most explicit statement in Lord Cur son’s pronouncement was to this effect:- H If you behave well, His Majesty’s Government will protect you against all comers”. His Majesty’s Government had, in Sir A. Ryan’s opinion, taken a serious risk in delaying the recent specific promise of protection to the Sheikh of Qatar, Their reluctance to respond to earlier appeals by the Sheikh for some guarantee of protection had almost driven him into the arms of Ibn 3aud He reminded the meeting that the Sheikh had visitea Kiyaah a few years back and while there had established relations with Ibn Saud which appeared to have been a great deal closer than was altogether convenient for His Majesty's Government. COLONEL FOWLS held that His Majesty’s Government had, in their Treaty with Qatar, an effective instrument for prevent- mg such developments and an adequate ground for punihive action if they materialised. In this case, S-.oj.-d Qatar had, in fact, done nothing serious. 11, . AIE VICE - 41ARSHAL pointed out that even lf thi ^ '•ere &amp;o, the Sheikh had refused for years *o years t0 agree to a ■landmg ground in Qatar althouB-h it v, , , for&gt; ^ Xt had been strongly pressed verting to the incident at Behai i n October 193u ViCe ~ MarShal C ° Urtney -P-ted that the Air Ministry were unable to find that the pronouncements of the Government of India covered the support which the fioyal Air Force had affor- Hi * incs try, he said, were of course at all times ready to give this support, but he must point out that they had net formally assumed any obligation to do so. The second proclamation issued by Colonel Fowle on the 24th of October had warned the inhabi tanfc? +h«+ xj.ixiau± bctntfo i,nat those responsible w111 ' be to account'. This was in the last resort a threat of force and it implied that His Majesty's Government were prepared to take action beyond any that was now formally provided for. If, therefore, the policy recommended by Colonel Powle was to be approved, the Air Ministry must press, if only out of consideration for the Air Officer Commanding in Iraq, that the Committee should make a recommendation to clarify the policy of His Majesty's Government in regard to such action. MR. RE1IDSL suggested that, if His Majesty’s Government were to admit their ultimate responsibility for the affairs of the Trucial Coast, such eventual action might be coveredo AIR VICE-MARSHAL COURTESY and AIR VICE-MARSHAL BURNETT referring to the fact that in certain possibilities the Air Officer Commanding in Iraq might be called upon for assistance, both insisted strongly that these possibilities were not by any means remote. They were, in fact, daily becoming more urgent and when there were oil concessions to be protected the Royal Air Force would need more facilities, such as landing grounds, than were at present available. --hey o u ul 1 net, therefore, agree to leave the matter in an uncertain state.\ -13- Tiiftrii. af ter ifiE CHAIRMAN then proposed, and some further discussion agreed. the Sub-C ommit te e to recommend as follows:- (1) chat His ^Majesty’s Government must admit ultimate international resoonsibility for the affairs of the Trucial Coast, inc1uding Qa t ar; (2) that the Air Officer Commanding in Iraq might be informed that intervention on land in the Trucial Sheikhdoms was an’ additional commitment which he might in certain circumstances be called iroon to meet; (3) that the interested Departments should examine the personal suggestion put forward by Captain Phillips, for the appointment of an Englishman as agent on the Trucial Coast in place of the present native Residency agent at Sharjah; (4) that as the departments represented on the Sub-Committee were unable to reach agreement as to the necessity or otherwise for a new pronouncement or the adoption of a new policy in the Persian Gulf, this matter should therefore be reserved for further consideration. /Air Vice-Marshal Courtney, Air Vice-Marshal Burnett, Captain Phillips and Mr. Seal then left the meeting which proceeded to discuss the question of lhe Eastern and South- Eastern boundaries of Saudi-Arabia.

THE CHAIRMAN opened the discussion by saying that he understood that the situation was that a deadlock had been reached in the negotiations with the Saudi Government over the question of the frontier, and from the papers that he had read on the subject it did not look as though there was much hope of reaching a solution. H e was not personally familial v.i.t,. the question and his observations were, therefore, made primarily with the object of eliciting information, but he would be glad to Know whether it could be regarded as satis factorily established that it was, in fact, worth while pursuing the negotiations in these circumstances. Was it really a matter of urgency that these botmdaries shoula be settled? was it not a fact that the permanence of the Saudi-15- ■bmpire depended to a large extent on the life 0 f one t-o 01 one man - Kino- Ion Baud? Were thp q-nv ^ . , 6 • e kuo-Committes satisfied that, m these eiroumetanoes, it was desirahle that his raies^'o e - 11 ° iil8 - J Q s ty s G-overnment should hind themes lyes to e ^ J -'' x - -r frontier in these areas despite the uncertainty of the future? 8IR A * KYAH explained that the settlement of the frontier was now an urgent matter for two main reasons. m the f 1rBt Place, as regards the northern end of the frontier, the question or oil now made an early settlement imperative, since disputes hSa ari36n oyer the areas of certain important oil concessions, econdlj, the eiction which his Majesty's Government had been obliged to tame in aefining their interpretation of the frontier h_._ created in I bn Saud a genuine sense of injury which was poisoning the relations between His Majesty’s (Government and Sauai Arabia. Sir A, Ryan was anxious to see this source of friction removed since at present it was rendering Anglo-Saudj. relations extremely difficult, and furnishing a ready handle to all those who wished to exploit Ibn Saud f s feeling of resentment to the disadvantage of His Majesty’s Government. MR. RENDER further developed Sir A. Ryan’s points. In the first place, the oil question was one of increasing urgency, since King Ibn Saud had now openly challenged the situation created by the grant by the Sheikh of Qatar of an oil concession over his territory to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, Ibn Saud had protested strongly against this concession, and had even threatened to take steps to prevent its exploitation. Further, there was reason to believe that the American oil interests who had obtained a concession from Ibn Saud would be quite ready to extend their operations over the disputed area, thus confronting His Majesty's Government with a most embarrassing fait accompl i. Again, various interests were actively seeking to obtain an oil concession (or at least a prospecting licence) from the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, which would lead to further difficulties if no boundary ©.XX s ted.Secondly, unless s there would he no i lm some boundary could be agreed upon, ■ iiiii c to Ibn Baud’s ex'^pne-? + 1 s expansion towards the St ’ 311(1 ^ hiS C °— d penetration into the hinteriand ^ ^ TrUCial Sh ~ ^ - Ul d pay us tetter to ayroe on a boundary which would set a ter, to his expansion, than, ° y leaVlng th6 SitUati0n fluid &gt; ^ risk finding that he had further extended his influence over - and possibly even in sone oases completely absorbed - the territory or tribes of our proteges. Thirdly - and this was a point of great importance - bis Majesty's Government were confronted with a situation of great aelicacy ana even danger in the Red Sea area. fhe Italians were making strenuous efforts to extend their influence and undermine our position, and were constantly making advances to Ibn Saud. While it might not be to the latter's ultimate interest to respond to these advances, he mignt be driven to do so if he felt that His Majesty's Govern ment were not prepared to give him a 'square deal'. it was, therefore, of major political importance that we should treat _l jn Baud as generously as possible over 'the grievance which he felt against us in this matter of the frontier. Lastly, His Majesty’s Government were committed to continue negotiations by their acceptance of Ibn Baud’s invitation to Sir A. Ryan to visit Riyadh on his return to his post next montho It was essential that Sir A. Ryan should have instructions enabling him to make constructive proposals at his meeting with the King, and, if these instructions were to be ready before his departure, time was extemely short. MR. CLAUSOH said that the India Office, vrlthout necessarily accepting all the foreign Office arguments, did not wish to dissent from Mr e Rendel’s conclusion, and agreed that it would be convenient to reach an early settlement. They would not, however, regard failure to reach an agreement with Ibn Saud over this question of the frontier as necessarily disastrous.,£K * ia ' ;fi ' 0SL then B«imjaUeed the ivc„nt history of the Q110 SCiOTl# Ho r»f-r*c,'l 1 ( 0 &gt;rl : V C .4 , Gcxij - eci Uiici0 ^ a resu.lt of American en~ cjaines, nib Kajestyus government had felt obliged to define their interpretation of the legal position, which was that Ai&lt;_. x non biers set up by the Anglo-Turkish Conventions of Iflo and 1914 (i.e. , the '‘blue' and 'violet'® lines) were still internationally valid. The fact that one of these ooirvencions naa not been ratified was irrelevant since the frontier was fully covered'by the ratified Convention, moreover, legally I bn Send could not escape from the liabilities of an Ottoman succession State, especially in view of his pre-war agreement with the Ottoman Government, by which he accepted Ottoman suzerainty. But a careful re-examination of the question had shown that, while the legal position might have been unassailable had the territory on the non-Saudi side of the line been under the effective sovereignty of any other Power, tnere would be great difficulty in holding Ion baud back, as it were, against a vacuum. Our position was, therefore, by no means as strong as we had at first supposed. neverthe less, our policy hitherto had been consistently based on the principle of holding I bn baud bac.x as far as possi ole, and the weakness of our position had always been that we could make no effective positive claims on behalf of our selves or our proteges to the territory on the easuarn side of the line we had proposed, but that it was still auainst a vacuum that we were trying to establish, h'-e eastern limit of Ibn Sand’s dominions. Our object hau, of coarse, been not to commit ourselves to &amp; recognition of Saudi authority over an area over which it might wane on the termination of Ibn Saul’s personal rule; bat it-18 now seemed rdain +&gt;/-■ , , L '^ the lriaint enence of this negative policy would be impossible. ibn '•■ nn 1 , 1 Dn ^ ciLIa n made it clear that he would only be wi i -i •; v ir . iid oc willing to o.ibcuss the matter on the basis of positive claims on belief or o / / ^ _ 1 0feAlci11 01 oar proteges, and lt &gt;,as onJ -d by following up sue ■ a ro itUr- i • &amp; 1 “ a pOoluive policy that a settlement was now lihely to be reached. Although it was easy to be. wise after the event, Mr. 2 end el felt bound to say that he thought our tactics had been faulty. Having obtained from Ibn Baud on the 3rd April last a clear and reasoned - though no doubt tardy and exaggerated - statement of his claims, we had virtually ignored Ms proposals and retorted immediately proposing first one and then another artificial line y ' e could not adequately defend. One of our key points on our proposed line had been the Well oa Banaiyan, and it was largely on this point that the deadlock had been reached in June. But now it was clear, from later information from British authorities m the Persian Gulip that the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi had no real claim to Banaiyan, that it was a predominantly Murra well, and that it would, be necessary to give way over it. Mr. Pended therefore suggested that Kis Majesty's Government should now try to define a new frontier line, based on the reasonable maximum claims of our proteges and on the reasonable claims of Ibn Baud to suzerainty over certain tribes, such as the Murra, hearing in mind at the same time questions of oil and of protection, but without giving too much importance to the risk of a possible vacuum on the Saudi side of it. The necessary data were now available, and he was prepared to make general suggestions for such a line.\ ■ \ -19 1'^ “ '-'LAuduLI said that he under at non f./fv. r i » - a^i ooooa itr. Rendel s proposal t0 06 tnat EiF ' a;iesty ’ £ Government should now agree, as it •/ere, to transfer the vacuum to the Saudi side of the frontier. But it seemed undesirable to eetaolish any frontier lino .flirther than the limits Th-n co-n^t 0 0 - L iLri b aua s real authority. if the frontier V/as to oe fixed on the basis of the limits of the territory over which the Trueial Sheikhs exercised any ' cuithoi ity it might conceivably be desirable to revive the idea of a n desert zone- , though, he himself, did not know much about the details of this idea and believed it had not found favour with the Committee. Otherwise, while further con cessions to Ibn Saud in the desert area might be considered if ti,.er— were a really firm prospect of agreement, the India Office coula not agree to tne boundaries of the frueial sheikhdoms oeing .fixed and to Ibn oaud being allowed to come right up to them. MR. RhNDhL said that it now seemed inevitable that the boundary should be co-terminous, but explained that the line that he was about to suggest was not intended to constitute a frontier in the ordinary sense of the word. It had al ways been clearly recognised that frontiers in the European sense were entirely inapplicable to these desert areas. On the other hand, the various devices which had been suggested for getting over the difficulty of a v *frontier- in such an area, eng,, a desert zone, a neutral (or unattributed) belt, a purely tribal definition, etc. , had all been found impractic able. The present proposal was for a line which should, so to speak, bisect what would otherwise have been a neutral area. It was not intended that it should be a line up to which the authority of each side should in practice De t ally and effectively exercised. In practice the effective authority for each side would probably step short a long way from the actual line. It was a liremeant as far as possible t -o bisect the empty space between c,ne j£actc limits cf the t 10 C'-^tnorities, hut which would nevertheless mrk the ultimate limits to which each authority coulw., legitimately be extended, it os any line in the desert m it should he woulcl necessarily 'be — must be - an artificial line. But, so drawn wherever practicable as to provide on either side for as wide a space as possible of empty territory which would incidentally give the Air Ministry the space ,: to turn round in' for which they had so often pressed. j.nr, Rend el sngges u ea that in fixing this line we should ufc glided mainly oy the new information now available as to the areas predominantly wandered over by the Murra tribe, 1*6,, the Murra Lira., He explained that none of our proteges bad ever claimed to exercise any effective control over the Murra tribe, that His Majesty's Government had never seriously challenged Ibn Baud's claim to exercise suzerainty over them and had acquiesced in Fuad Bey's contention that the tribe ?/as under Saudi suzerainty, and that in practice it would be impossible to refuse to recognise Ibn Baud's claim to wells predominantly used by that tribe. If this criterion were adopted and we were to base any new concessions on the latest information regarding the extent of the Murra Dir a, it was now clear that His Majesty's Government must abandon their claim to the wells a o Bano.iyan, and this concession might be important seeing the stress which Fuad Hey had laid on the point in London. On the other hand there were certain areas which Hxs majesty s Government could not in any circumstances concede to Ion Baud. The first was the area actually covered by the nev/ Anglo --I rani an Qatar oil concession. The Sheikh of Qatar 5 ll had, ^ with the approval of His Majesty's Government -SO-1 ■ granted to the A t a n n '' “• I -°- C - a certain area which we haa ■, garded as beinr .

RYAN entirely agreed that there should be no question of Ion Baud being allowed to acquire an outlet to the sea to tne east of the Qatar Peninsula. Basing himself on these principles, as a tentative basis for discussion a new MR. RENBBL suggested line running some what as follows:- (a) Starting from a point on the coast, say, four miles to the north-east of Qasr-el-Salwa, the line would run south-eastwards to a point (which could be called key point T A f ), at, say, the western end of the salt lake discovered by Mr. Bertram Thomas and known as the Sabkhat-el-Amarah. This would give a small further concession to Ibn Baud in an area to which he attached great importance, without at the same time abandoning any territory to which the sheikh of Qatar had a reasonable claim. It would also establish a line parallel to the line of the A.I.O.C. coneession and in comparison with the so-called ''protection line', would actually be somewhat more satisfactory from the Air Ministry point of view. The details could, of course, only be worked out locally, but generally speaking such a line would seem to take reasonable account of the physical and political features of the situation. -Bl~mmthis point (key D 0 in + south until the poLt point 'B 7 ) where due of (h) Prom 'PStP' } . the llne wouid run i t v, he called key the Hurra'Dira' as defined iPtheP aor P ern Rd g 8 i'rcm Colonel Dickson 1 „i n olle l ai;e st information supplied hyP^fo^hicPa^uPu^tm MP circulated to the meetino- hh teen of Ahu Dhahi a reaBonahie'heh I W ° Ula giYe the sh eikh td exercise thehhPo wh-h °£ Coast to enable him possessed oyer the Fhor-al odPri Recognised that he line (be tween key poirP &gt; A° ant-n &gt; Thl t Part cf . the the western frontier of the She'iichdom of^Dtobi)^ (C; Ihf' ?/ ro ® ke y Pop* ’B’) the line might rui. ^icigonally m a straight line to ? say the inter- secoion of parallel 2P and meridian 54 3 thus ro'oghly i oil owing the northern limit of the Hurra Dira as snown on the blue print supplied by Colonel Dickson.

Possibly such a point mig oe found at the Dhuwaihim wells as shown on Major lit Cheeseman’s map* or at the well of oufuk ? which the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi claimed* although Fuad Bey had also put forward a strong Saudi claim to it. i/d) From the intersection of parallel DC and meridian 54 the line would run due south to the point shown on Colonel Dickson’s blue print as Sabkhat Mijora. This would give I bn Baud a small part of the Manas ir country, hut leave the hulk of the Dira of this tribe* which were mainly an Abu Dhabi one* outside Ibn gaud’s controlo (e) If the line then followed roughly the southern limits of the Hurra Dira* as shown on Colonel Dickson’s blue print * it would correspond broadly to the southern frontier offered to Fuad Bey in June* and would produce a frontier line which would correspond with the latest information now received from Aden.

If a large offer were now made to Ihn Baud, Ile m:Lght thlllk that he ha ' 1 got His Majesty's Government 'on uie ruif' and wait for them to run still further. Sir A* v-ycxn eoulu not affirm that the offer now proposed would bring about a settlement, as it would be based on considerations connected with the Dira of the Murra tribe only, whereas Ihn Baud's statement of his desiderata purported to rest on claims to sovereignty over the Murra, part of the Manasir and two other less-known tribes, nevertheless, he thought that the proposed offer, even if it did not lead to a settlement, would place His Majesty’s Government in a more advantageous position. They could point out that they had given full consideration to Fuad Bey Hamsa’s statement regarding what should be included in the Dira of the Murra, the one tribe involved to which Ibn Baud appeared to have a strong claim; and that, although they had found it to he more extensive than they supposed, they were not deterred by that fact from making their further information regarding it the oasis oi a new and generous offer. Bir a. Ryan considered uh&amp;t, if ion Baud retorted by pressing his other demands ana a rupture ensued.

Fowle's o tjsiislfce request to continue a previous survey for water, telegram of 20th August, 1935, from the Political Resident stated that they were opening negotiations for two-year options over Abu Dhabi and Debai . In an express letter of 5th June Col. Fowle forwarded for favourable consideration a suggestion from Major Holmes that application might be made by an 80% - 100% British company for concessions in Abu Dhabi and Debai. Major Holmes has been seen at the 1.0. on 24th June, 7th October and 11th October ^&gt;1 (Col. Fowle being present on the last two occasions), and on ■ v’A 16th October at 3.30 is bringing Sir Edmund ^avis (described in &gt;'* A A j AWho's Who as 'Chairman and Director of many mining companies') N'T/d*' O- 1 ' 7 ' to give particulars regarding the interests which would be «v prepared to back such a scheme. Col. Fowle considers that if we are satisfied of the financial soundness and British nationality of a new company which desires to interest itself in the Trucial Coast, we should allow them to compete for an option on Abu Dhabi and Debai, subject to the approval of H.M.G. of the terms of such option, if obtained. Moreover, approval of any option, by whoever obtained, would be subject to the conditions (a), (b), (c) stated/ |p&gt;stated in Col. Fowle's note of 3rd October flagged, and also the condition that further approval by H.M.G. would be necessary before negotiations for a concession were entered into with the Sheikh. At the interview tomorrow we can hear Sir E. Davis’s proposals and inform him that the question of permitting a new company to apply for an option will be considered. We should then consider it in consultation with the Petroleum Dept, and the F.O. with reference to the financial and British standing of the company and the prospects of their being able to command the technical resources necessary for making a success of a concession. I would also inform him of the conditions stated above which would attach to approval of any option obtained. The only question of difficulty at this stage lies in our relations with the A.P.O.C. and the fact that they also are interested in obtaining options on Abu Dhabi and Debai. Pending consideration of Sir E. Davis’s proposals, it would seem best to send a stand-fast order to the Political Resident - i.e., ask him to warn the two Sheikhs that they should not proceed with any negotiations for options pending further advice. Otherwise, if the A.P.O.C. obtain options, even thou^i they would be subject to H.M.G.’s approval, it would be difficult to admit another competitor. The position should also be explained d.o. to the A.P.O.C. We could also promise Sir E. Davis to consider the question of permitting applications for options at Ajman and Umm al Qaiwain. if he desires this and raises the point. We understand from Major Holmes that the new company would desire to be considered for the pert of Behrein liich is not elre.d, included in the concession of the B^rsin Petrol..

Activities of the A.P. 0 . Please see the previous submission on P.Z. 3521 / 35 , regarding the activities of the A.P.o.C. on the Trucial Coast. Since then the Company has secured an option from the Sheikh of Ras al Khaimah* which would give them the right to explore for oil in his territory, with the object of negotiation within that period for an oil concession. This agreement is, of course, subject to the approval of His Majesty’s ifar Government which has not^been granted* i«i,« ira,twfrfoo kx* to* kstucM OtLiftiilt'ftici* 11 *Zhe matter with A Colonel Powle during his deputation in this country. After dealing with Ras al Khaimah the Company proceeded to open negotiations for similar options in other Sheikhdoms, and have since secured an option &lt;on Shargah. The other places that they have in mind are understood to be Abu Dhabi, Debai, Ajman and Umrn al Khaiwam. They have in all cases been told that any engagements they enter into will be subject to the approval of His Majesty’s Government. These exploration agreements would, of course, be merely for the purpose of discovering whether oil is likely, in fact, to exist on the Trucial Coast, and in the event of the experts' survey teing fruitless, the whole matter will automatically come to nothing. If, however, the Co^any were to he convinced that there was a probability of oil being commercial quantities, the Company would then^enter into/ v&lt;n 2 into negotiations with the various Sheikhs for proper oil concessions. After discussion with Colonel Fowle it is proposed that His Majesty's Government's sanction to any exploration agreements on the Trucial Coast should t&gt;e accompanied by the conditions stated on page 3 of Colonel Fowle's note of the 3rd October (flagged) and also to the condition that His Majesty's Government's prior approval would 'be necessary before negotiations were entered into with the Sheikh in question for &lt;»■ an agreement for the extraction of oil. These proposals will, of course, have to he considered hy the other interested Departments of His Majesty’s Government and a submission will he made on the subject shortly. Meanwhile Major Holmes has once more come into the picture. Some months ago he approached the Political Resident with a view to discovering how His Majesty’s Government would view the possibility of a 100 per cent. British Company which he (Holmes) thought he could gel together with a view to exploiting oil in + f]P ^ • f -h far&gt;f - n nnrTpl ni tr- 1 pnilii i -''i 1 j, ]' l i Q the Trucial Coast. The ^ L.

Recently/ \ a tRecently, when Colonel Powle met Major Holmes in London the latter stated that he thought he could ‘ 10V glVe the India 0ffioe some more information about jus hackers and the two interviews with Major Holmes ' i ' ntaa '• ;1 j uce on the ^th October and the 11th October, of which notes are immediately below, were the result. It will he observed that as Major Holmes has been so long in producing his backers, the A.P. O.C. have more or less got a footing on the Trucial Coast. .oven now it is not at all clear whether the 100 per cent. Company is actually a practical proposition. It is therefore proposed for thepresent to take the following line: (1) If Sir Edmund Davis appears to be seriously determined to form a Company, if he gives a complete account of what the Company would consist of then tie advice of the Petroleum Department will be taken as to whether such a Company would be likely to be able to work satisfactorily ftny oil concessions that they might secure. (2) If before next Tuesday, as seems possible, the A.P. O.C. have secured options in any other Sheikhdoms on the Trucial Coast, e-g. Abu Dhabi, Sir Edmund Davis should be informed of this so that he should be able to consider the situation in the light of the fact that the A.P. O.C. have 'got a start' on the Coast. (3) If before Tuesday the A.P. O.C. have not 4.. 4+ ‘be for consideration, secured any more options, it will oe i oi in the light of the interview with Sir Edmund Davis, whether/^nether a tele gram should be sent tQ Colonei instructing him to tell the Sheikhs of Abu Dhabi and (? ^ A3man and *1 Khaiwam) not to conclude 8117 agreement of ki ^ the A.P o.C. for the present, m view of the faTt * nC V ^ anot her Company bo-in tlin n, QUftht^ to br. aii lu .i, a - ei an ee of cmpnet.ippr wi+v, ■ | -bi : - j p_ o_ 1-- considering the whole matter it will be desirable to keep the following considerations in mind: ^ a ) ^ rie A*P*0.

It may be most convenient, especially as they have the neighbouring concession of Qatar, that they should be the people to work the Trucial Coast if anybody works it, and that we should not have to deal with more than one Company in that particular part of the world. (b) Major Holmes has not a very satisfactory back hi story and one must naturally be certain of one s ground before recognising any Company which he may have started. (c) A combine of South African Coal miners may not be a suitable body for exploiting oil concessions and may not be able to secure markets for selling it when they have exploited it. For the moment it is only requested that general approval be given to the line that is at present being taken.~^^~^y^~^iS2_23_0oto'ber llt.h -j^IL-^a jor Hq] a.' ■— p ^ H ° lme8 ° alled ° n °^°^ r nth. m„ Walton, 0101161 ' ,,0Wle and Mr - bauson were present. Major Holmes explained that he had not been able to arrange for Sir Edmund Davis t o come along, but he to come to the noped to fix an appointment for him India Office next week. It was arranged that Sir Edmund should come at M.30 on Tuesday to see Mr. Walton. Major Holmes went over much the same ground as was covered during his visit to the India Office on the 9th October. He said that he hoped Sir Edmund would be able to tell Mr. Walton on Tuesday all about the people whom it was hoped to make into the 100 per cent. British Company. He said that they were South African Magnates and that one of the bodies concerned was called the Anglo-American Corporation of South Africa. (He asked particularly that it should not be mentioned to anybody that he had given us this information). He stressed the fact that, in spite of the name, there was no American money or participation in the Corporation. He seemed a little vague as to how far this Corporation and the other body concerned (whose name he aid not mention) would come up to scratch, but he implied that Sir Edmund Davis would be able to say all about tnai. He asked what the attitude of His Majesty's Government would be towards p Company of this kind if it wanted to seek concessions in the Koweit Neutral Zone, the unconceded portion of Bahrein and the Trucial Coast. Mr. Walton said that as Major Holmes probably knows, there/i.here is something of a dear'llr,M • t, u a deadlock m regard to the Koweit Neutral Zone. Neither Thr c a ner Itn SaU( i nor the Sheikh can give a concession without the consent and co-operation of the other, ihn Saud is committed to his own American Company and the Sheikh is understood &lt;-o be reluctant to have anything to do with the matter ° n tlUS ' bas:ls - Major Holmes said he certainly understood there was difficulty in regard to the Koweit Neutral Zone, but he was not clear whether it was insuperable. ^^ / ^ &gt;0c tX4 ^ X J L CtCOf 'fc—) t'S-i+ty »n, f- 4* £~ 4^^/tt ^ In regard to Bahrein, Mr. Walton said that there ' certainly is a portion of the territory not included in t-ne concession of the Bahrein Petroleum Company, an d i'b would he for consideration whether a 100 per cent. British Company might have a chance of competing for it. He could not, however, say anything definite on the subject. As regards the Trucial Coast he felt he should tell Major Holmes, as he perhaps already knew, that the A.P.O. C. had already obtained options from the Sheikhs of Ras al Khaimah and Shargah. These options were subject to the approval of His Majesty*s Government and therefore the matters could not be said to have been concluded; but for the purposes of a new Company it would have to be assumed that Ras al Khaimah and Shargah rere ni-nnorMr-nnouniod and: oan.l competed f-w. It was further known that the A.P.O.C. were thinking of trying to secure options at Abu Dnabi Debai, but for the present the Trucial Coast be ope^o all with the exception2. 'I Oj. Has al Khaimah and Sharpah/. Th P r.e -, S 2 ihere was also Muscat v/here the field was still open. Mjor Holmes noted these statements and said he would he seeing Sin Edmund Davis before Tuesday. k % 'loi—i ' ''''' &gt; &lt; ^ if f-^C. ]A- — fofc ijt 0 / m Colonel Fowle brought Major Holmes in for a few minutes' conversation on 7th October. Major Holmes said that he had been approached by the Iraq Petroleum Co. to act for them in regard to the securing of concessions (a) in the Koweit neutral zone; (b) in the portion 01 Bahrein not allocated to the Bahrein Petroleum Co.; (c) on the Trucial Coast. So far as his personal interests go this is an attractive proposition, and he would like to take it up. On the other hand, his conscience compels him, before doing so, to consicer the other alternative which is open to him - namely, to act on behalf of the 100% British company of which he has for some time been proposing to suggest the formation and which he has been proposing to interest in Persian Gulf oil. Major Holmes said that when he raised this matter with the India Office some time back he was told that he ought to have behind him before he started concession-hunting a well-established technical company which would have the technical experience and personnel1/ to work any concession which mi^t be obtained, when he went with the results of this xnterview to hxs backers they thought that he had mishandled the matter with the India Office, and more or less threw in their hands. Quite recently, however, Sir Edmund Davis (who, I gather, has been abroad and has recently come home) had been in touch with him and was keen on reviving the iaea of this new 100% British company. Major Holmes therefore suggested, and Colonel Fowle urged, that he should be allowed to come along, bringing Sir Edmund Davis to talk about the matter further. It was agreed that it was desirable to await Mr. Walton’s return, and the time was fixed at 11.30 on Friday morning, the 11th October. I Major Holmes gave no indication of who his backers were, except that they were connected with gold mining in South Africa. His theory is that they have plenty of money and therefore would be able, when they floated their company, to employ the best possible technical experts to work the concession, although they have no experience themselves of oil concessions.I onaerstooci him to say also seeking markets and so on the li^e the Bahrein Petroleum Co into the Oil Ring. say also that in the matter of so on they would employ experts and, a Co., would fight their way Major Holmes will be prepared to lay his cards on the table, and it will then be possible to consult the Presumably at the meeting on Friday Major Holmes will be prepared to lay his card morning Petroleum Department. It will of course have to be borne in mind that the A.P.Q.C. have already secured a number of options on the irucial Coast, subject to the approval of His Majesty's Government. The position m regard to the unconceded areas in Bahrein and the Koweit neutral zone will i have to be considered. I am not very clear in my mind whether the new company would propose to interest themselves in these areas as well as the Trucial Coast or not. There is also the question of Muscat. The Sultan of Muscat some time ago asked us for advice as to oil development in Muscat, and if an effective 100% British company is available, that might possibly be a promising field for their endeavours.Mr. Claison On the subject of certain recent oil developments oi which I informed you verbally. ^ About ten days or so ago I met Major Holmes and told him that we were anxious to find out about his hundred per cent. British company which, according to him. was aes ^ rous 01 obtaining an oil concession on the Trucial Co a.st. Major H. said that he would approach his backers, whose names he still did not give, and would communicate again either with me or with the India Office. I have heard nothing further, nor, I believe, have you. Last Monday, at the suggestion of Sir John ? SkiVliTt Cadman, I met Mr. John Skirloss (I think that is how lie spells his name) of the I.P.C. Mr. J.S. gave me the following interesting information. Owing to the difficulties which the British elements of the I.P.C. were having with their foreign colleagues, a new company was being formed. Exactly what connection this company would have v/ith the I.P.C. was rather vague, but Mr. J.S. informed me that it would be rather on the lines of the d’Arcy Exploration Company, which goes ahead and seel© concessions/concessions for the A P n r mu n -„ •c.c. This new company, in which Mr. J.S. would, I gathered, play a prominent part, were going to get Major Holmes, if they could, to go to Koweit at some time m the future and approach the Sheikh on the subject of obtaining his consent to some sort of concession in the Neutral Zone. Mr. J.S. quite understood uhat the Sheikh could give no concession without H.M.G.’s sanction and also that of Ibn Saud. n The second line of activity of this new company would be on the Trucial Coast. For this purpose Mr. J.S. said they had two negotiators in mind, one Mr. Hedgeock and the other a Mr. Chapman, and asked what my views were on these two individuals. I said that, as he knew, Mr. Hedgcock had been at Muscat as Financial Adviser aid that I knew him very well, and that I did not think that he would be quite a suitable person for the purpose in view. Mr. J.S. said that the company would therefore choose Mr. Chapman and bring him round some time to introduce him to the India Office and talk the vhole matter over. B efore/Before H.M.G. give their sanction to any activities of any oil company, whether the one proposed by Kr. J.S. or any other, on the Trucial Coast, X think they should make the following terms: V is-a-vis the Company : - (&amp;.) that any geologist or employee who visits any of the Irucial Sheikhdoms for the purpose of exploring the option should, be of British nationality 5 (b) that the exploring party in their travels would be definitely guided by the views of the Resident as to where they should go. 1 Vis-a-vis the Sheikh:- (c) that the Sheikh concerned should give a definite guarantee in writing that he would be responsible for the safety of the exploring party and in case of aiy \y active aggression against the party would take action against the culprits and pay up whatever compensation H.M.G. considered suitable. These terms should go far to meet any oojections which the Air Ministry and the Foreign Office may make, on the lines that they produced at the C.I.D. meeting the other/CWP/AW, (51 group's)— - J W96&lt; DECYphtpp n-n E G R A i Erom Resi ^nt in the Persian Gulf to Secret a J!

Hot only was he keen to receive^ news of the liklihood of there being oil in his territory but also wishing to know if there were any likelihood of a good ground for boring artesian wexls. Like most of these Shaikhs he seemed to think the Geologist had only to look at a place to say just how much and how- deep down .the pil or water was, and it took me all my time explaining as well as I eould the difficulty and what ug exploration and length of time were needed before an inion could be expected from a Geologist. Later when we returned to Ras-al^ahimah Mr. Lison informed the Shaikh ttet he had not been able to • +« ■*&gt;Vua Qhcrt visit snd h.6 I* 1 any opinion owing to the snc , n-no-pr visit by the D t Arcy nested a further and longer ^is. i j w/aot'he'r The Shaikh said he deration in the cold weather.■* 3 *.

The conditi for this promise were either that the Company bored several artesian wells in his territory or that they paid him Rs. 750 per mensem during the period of two years, If we had not requested the two years permission the Shaik would not have asked for any payment. But, as he said, he felt that if he was to be stopped frot bringing in who were perhaps keener on finding oil than we/were we should pay him something for the delay. On the coast +• rtur movements in Kuwait and there is nothing secret# our movemen «atar, and the movements of Others in Bahrain are known to the different Shaikhs almost as soon as they are carried out - and it was only by showing the Shaikh on the what a much .mailer territory his was in compare ^ + -r* that he consented to accept a with Kuwait and Q^atar* t than the amount he had been ^informed we smaller amount than tne had paid Qa-fcar®: Sid! ■ oinj V: fcij TOlp I COMPETITORS. 3&gt;ubai has receiTed a *** n etter and also Abu Dhabi sigaed by J-rank Holmes and offering them to bring his men in and search for water and oil. m his letters he quotes the good work he has done for the Arabs in Bahrain and Kuwait and hints that only he could have found water and oil in those places.

The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. (Copy to i Political Agent, Bahrain). ABU DHABI - OIL. J During the exchange of calls with the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi on 18th July 1935, the latter mentioned the prospect of finding artesian water and/or oil in his Shaikhdom. The following account of the conversations is forwarded, at the Shaikh 1 s request, for your information. 2. - At first the Shaikh wished to know the relative merits of the geologist at Kishm and Mr .Cox, who visited Abu Dhabi last December. On hearing that they were both considered to be good experienced men, he then asked whether they compared with the American geologists who found oil at Bahrain. On this point he was reassured. 3. - The Shaikh then went on to deal with events in this connection at Abu Dhabi. He explained how Mr .Cox advised him that artesian water might be found at 200 feet and said that later he had a visit from Mr.Williamson who predicted 1000 feet, and assured the Shaikh that his Company would drill for him. 4. ~~ It appears that this change of opinion did not impress the Shaikh who seems to have felt that it was '‘erely a clumsy attempt on the part of the Company to carry ou ^ t ^!'. ct r^g“ e for oil. He said that if water was available at both^levels, he would employ a contractor to drill t denon c-trated fact, throughout the interview, th ®. ^^^ ^nancial clearly that he was no fool where his possible financial interests were concerned. 5. - About this stage, ^ it reached^Abu Dhabi. Major Holmes of the Kuwait Cil Comp^y^ appears t o The latter, in a straight.!orwa saicl he thought there have favourably ^u L Lu^habi territory, that if the Shaikh agreed he woul f d fn Gulf oil having found STbSK KSSfI found the Shaikh _ his f 11. 6. - The Shaikh, who was under the impression that Major Holmes was an American, asked whether he would he able to conclude a private business agreement with him without incurring the wrath of H.M•Government. It was then pointed out that his Treaty engagements^ precluded him from granting any concessions of this nature v/ithout H.l.Government’s consent, and that an oil concession, liable to affect his whole Sheikhdom, could not be considered as a matter of private business. This view he professed to understand. 7. - It was further pointed out to the Shaikh that Major Holmes was English, but had American partners, and that it was understood that he was now in London arranging for an entirely English concern. Also that unless Major Holmes had found such a Company he would not be allowed to have any concession in Abu Dhabi by H.M.Government. 8. - Another point on which the Shaikh appeared anxious was the possibility of Major Holmes* arrival in Abu Dhabi before permission was received from the Honourable the political Resident to conclude an agreement. He was informed that .

I am glad to say that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company have at last arranged to send one of their own geologists - Allison - to visit Has al Khaimah at the end of this month. I understand that the delay was due to lack of interest in this a*ea by the Iraq Petroleum Company (under whom it falls and on whose behalf alone the Anglo-rersian Oil Company can act)* 2. In view of the strong foreign element in the Iraq Petroleum Company, and their lack of interest in this area, x feel that we should do all we can to encourage any group with a larger British element that is prepared to exploit the Trucial Coast. Have His Majesty-s Government been able to ascertain the composition and intentions of the group behind Hoimes 7 (see paragraph 3 of my letter .uoted above). , Officially I hold no brief for Holmes, as you ^ 3 * nv) and I was for example mainly (though I ^ P erS ° nal as chief . in having him removed fiom hi P instrumental in hav ng ^ presence n+otive in Bshr&amp;iu, ss Local ««« su . lt ,„ „„oaa.

Do they propose to work themselves any concession they can obtain ? if the answers to these questions are in the affirmative then it appears to me we should give them all the assistance we can* 4* The despatch of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company - Iraq Petroleum Company geologist to Has al Khaimah need not stand in the way of the policy suggested above. It binds neither the Iraq Petroleum Company nor the Shaikh and was pressed chiefly in order to forestall intrusion by any foreign element e.g. the French (vide paragraph 2 of my Express Letter N0.336-S of 27th April 1935). Even if the Iraq Petroleum Company pursue the matter further and eventually obtain a concession from the Shaikh this need not deter us from encouraging a British group to enter the field in respect of the rest of the Ifucial Coast. Stimulated by the'example of Bahrain, and more recently, of Qatar, all the Shaikhs of the Uncial Coast are now eager for the oil exploitation of their territories. • « this letter to Acheson and I am sending copies of this lei, 0016 * — c. t ' ^ &lt;c—^=--ar l &gt; i/ 4 (S 3683/185/91) FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l, 20th July, 1935.

K X ._ABU DHA B I - OIL. Daring the exchange of calls with the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi on 18th July 1935, the latter mentioned the prospect of finding artesian water and/or oil in his Shaikhdom. The following account of the conversation is forwarded, at the Shaikh’s request, for your information. 2. At first the Shaikh wished to know the relative merits of the geologists at Kishm and Mr.Cox, who visited Abu Dhabi last December. On hearing that they were both considered to be good experienced men, he then asked whether they compared with the American geologists who found oil at Bahrain. On this point he was reassured. 3. The Shaikh then went on to deal with events in this connection at Abu Dhabi. He -explained how Mr.Cox advised him that artesian water might be found at 200 feet and said that later he had a visit fron *'r. Williamson who predicted 1000 feet, and assured the Shaikh that his Company would drill for him. xi + chpnge of opinion did not •4. It appears that t us enc, b . . viqvp felt that it was impress the Shaikh who seems to ha ^ . nn the cart of the Company to carry merely a clumsy at tern P ^ ,, He 3S id that if water was out test drilling for oil. - e ' ■, i= he would employ a contractor t available at both levels, *e wou ■ t in fact throughout the interview drill to 200 feet first. In f*c,, ^ . , early that he was no .ool w. the Shaikh demonstrated • ! interests were concerned. His possible g that two letters from \ ^ Dajor holmes ot xne straightforward manner which appears The latter, m a straigm! ^ have favourably i m p regsed the _ Qai ^ h . said he thought there was a chance of finding n-n • - 11 m Abu Dhabi territory that if the Shaikh agreed hp a b 6ed he would send a geologist, and also mentioned that he was ex^r-i * ^ • was experienced in Gulf 0 ii having four_d the deposits in 'UoVrw ■? eposi.a m Bahrain and Mejd. Major HolTnes also informed the Shaikh that v,^ . aixn that he was prepared to come to ou Dhabi himself in mid —Au^u&lt;?t + mia August, and to send a geologist at any time of year. 6. The Shaikh, who was under the impression that Major Holmes was an American, asked whether he would be able to conclude a private business agreement with him without incurring the wrath of H.M. Government. It was then pointed out that his Treaty engagements precluded him from granting any concessions of this nature without H.M. Government’s consent, and that an oil concession, liable to affect his whole shaikhdom, could not be considered as a matter of private business. This view he professed to understand. 7. It was further pointed out to the Shaikh that Major Holmes was English, but had .American partners, and that it was understood that he was now in London arranging for an entirely English concern. Also that unless Major H - olmes had found such a company he would not be allowed tc h. ve any concession in Abu Dhabi by H.M.Government. 8 . Another point of which the Shaikh appeared anxious rr 1 i h Abu Dhao 1 was the possibility of Maj or Holmes received from the Honourable the before permission was reoei , J „ ^roOTent. He was informed Political Hesident to conclude an agreement not Visit the Shaikhdom without that Major Holmes would no. vi ^ p nlit ical authorities, though m view of permission from the Politica . . t0 0 ane back in August it is not Major Holmes' premise to ccm thought that he believed this. qheikh. was j Tittle doubt that the bnei^ 9.

It was understood that these islands were situated between Abu Dhabi and Yas but the Shaikh was most definite that no outsider should investigate without his permission. He complained of having been treated cavalierly in this respect by former A.P.O.C. investigators, and it is suggested that if the Shaikh is treated with tact and courtesy in this respect, better results will accuse. 1C. To summarise, the Shaikh:- (a) Wishes his territory to be examined for oil preferably by Major Holmes in whom he believes, but he is willing that an A.P.O.C. geologist should do this first, should P.R. so prefer, and no delays are entailed. (b ) Wishes to negotiate a concession with Major Holmes if Political Resident will allow it. (c) Has been promised a letter or visit from Major Holmes by mid-August. (d) Is jealous of his prerogative and wishes any geologist sent to obtain his peimission to search in areas desired, before doing so. u. I found the Shaikh very friendly, obviously sorry misdeeds and anxious to make amends; very his problems which lasted 40 instinct, intelligent and for his previous mi anxious for discussion on • j. . tini + Vi a keen business minutes, with resent ful of any slight . + . -he is touchy and resent u quick on a point, on his Shaikhly dignity.

In this connexion Mr.Walton recently reminded Mr.Lefroy of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company that His Majesty's Government attached importance to any exploratory work on the Trucial Coast being carried out by British subjects and we have also reminded the Resident of this demi-ofticially. vVe understand however from Mr.Lefroy that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company are not likely to send a man of their own to Abu Dhabi; if the Iraq Petroleun Company propose to send a man, he might not be a British subject. On general grounds the past policy of His Majesty's Government has aimed afsterilizing' the Trucial Coast so far as oil development is concerned, but if oil resources exist there and have to be developed it is important that as far as possible only British personnel should be employed. It is satisfactory that the Sheikh of Ras-el-Khaimah, who has been very troublesome in the past (in connexion with I:;'' 8 ^ th6 R&gt;A - P - Petr01 and recently in regard to &gt; ... „o la , a Mnttct „ th OTr poUt sloops, is now apparently adopting * I. .U1 b.

The representative was refused permission to proceed by the Political Agent, Bahrain. i»'r. Philby, the well-known Englishman living in baud! Arabia, is also believed to be interested in this new venture. 54. The Honourable the Political Resident is prepared to allow Major Holmes to try for the concessions provided his company will be 100% British. It is to be hoped that Major Holmes can enlist this British interest as he has shown considerable initiative in the past, particularly at Bahrain, and the A.I.Q.C. with their support from H. a.Government, are rather formidable opponents to private enterprise.,v } CONFIDENTIAL.

To send down an American geologist, following especially on the establishment of the Standard Oil in Hasa and in Bahrein, might moreover very well prejudice their negotiations with the Sheikh of Qatar and might leave on the local Sheikhs &amp;c* the impression that the Americans were the interest of real importance. Would they in these circumstances consider, even though it might cause them inconvenience, finding an English geologist to do the work? If so, no obstacles would be placed in his way and he would be given all facilities. The Company would appreciate the political considerations involved, and the fact that the preferable alternative for His Majesty's Government to allowing exploration or development of these areas by foreigners was to close them (as had been their policy hitherto) for Purposes of oll dev.lopmt to .U ” consider the matter further.

The negotiations were initially with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company Limited (APOC) (later known as the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (AIOC)) and the D'Arcy Exploration Company Limited, but D'Arcy's rights were subsequently taken over by Petroleum Concessions Limited (PCL) (a subsidiary company of the Iraq Petroleum Company (IPC), but in which the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company were a partner).The papers cover: oil explorations in the region; the role of Frank Holmes in the negotiations; claims on the area by the Iraq Petroleum Company; the desire of the British Government to encourage exploitation of Trucial Coast oil by a group with a majority British element, as the Iraq Petroleum Company was strongly non-British controlled; official British satisfaction that a company with substantial British interests (PCL) had been able to counter the threat of American penetration in the area (folios 257-258); draft concession agreements; correspondence between PCL and local rulers about the transfer of D'Arcy's rights to PCL (folios 85-86); correspondence between the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and local rulers making them responsible for the safety of surveying parties in their territories (folios 69-78); correspondence between the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and local rulers informing them that approval had been granted to PCL by the British Government to enter into negotiations over concessions in their territories (folios 36-47); and the insistence of the Shaikh of Dubai [Sa‘īd bin Maktūm Āl Maktūm] that Haji Williamson [William Richard Williamson] should accompany any survey party sent into his territory (folios 10 and 14).The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year.
