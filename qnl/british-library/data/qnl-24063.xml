Dear Sir: As the Tanker SS w El Segundo' is here to do a very special job in a short length of time, Captain I. B. Smith and myself would like to limit the number of visit cars allowed aboard to the European residents, the shaikhs and their families, and the more important merchants. We have set aside Friday for visiting day. Europeans and Shaikhs will be welcome at any time without passes, but I think it would be advisable if all others would secure passes from you, from Mr. Belgrave, or from myself. I would appreciate your informing those concerned of the above arrangement, or I will do so myself if you prefer it. Yours very truly, E. A. SKENITER. B cc - Captain I. B.
