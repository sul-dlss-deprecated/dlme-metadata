This visit might, it is suggested, form part of the co operation in publicity suggested in paragraph 3 of our telegram referred to above. It might perhaps be represented that such a visit would prepare the ground for sympathetic reception of Af gh an broadcasts in India, as soon as these are undertaken, and promote recognition in Indian broadcasts and press of the achievements of Afghanistan under the present regime. I am to enquire whether you think that such a visit would be advantageous. If so, I am to request that, if you see no objection, you will kindly ascertain from the Afghan Government, without entering into any definite commitment, whether they would welcome such a proposal.

THE I HAITIAN QOVmiimt MOAJXZAQTim STATION * H/.DIO-T£HRAN H . !• The Inangural celebration took place on April 24th 1940 in the presence of the Crown Prince. . programle lasting from 7 p.ra. to 11 p. u local tine, was broadcast. This bc;an with a loyal address by the j rime inister, thanking the royal family for having bestowed a radio station upon the country, and enlarging upon the benefits it wouftd confer. Then followed a speech by the sinister of Posts, Telegraphs and Telephones, describing the installation already completed and the additions contemplated in the near future. The substance of this latter speech was then given in Arabic, Turkish, French, Russian, English and German, in that order. The English announcer (a man) was an Iranian, who delivered his English quite well, very audibly, and with tew mistakes; his main fault, from an English point of view, was a rather histrionic manner. The other foreign announce ients were quite competently done, and were easy to follow. 2. The following is the substance of what was announced:-* Two transmitters are in operation. (a) Station EkA, a medium-wave transmitter of 3 kilowatts power, adaptable over a range of from 250 to 560 metre© It operates on 335.2 metres (895 kilocycles) for the Tehran district. (b) A short-wave transmitter of 14 kilowatts power, adaptable over a range of from 14 to 80 metres, intended for nore distant regions in Iran, and for abroad. It will operate in time on the following frequencies:- 16.16 metres, or 18.560 19.87 * M 15.100 27.75 ' ' 10.810 30.99 * ” 9.680 36.99 w ” 8.110 48.74 M ' 6.155 iggacycles t# « h- 2 - only of these short-were fpecmeneiee «r« ftt present la operation, n^aeljr;- *m f 19,87 mtv** B C, SO,99 w 3, The present hour® of broa&amp;e&amp;sting «r©:- (i) 11,SO to 14,00 loeal tlae (8,00 to 10.50 QWS) on ©ta tioaie E .

Telegraph® A Telephonee could also be used for wireless tele graphy and telephony. Its power for telegraphic purpose® would be 32 kilowatts. The apparatus, constructed by Telefunken, had been delivered in November 1939, and erected by i'aroh i940. Two further tranamittors were cm order from the ^ell—Standard Telephone Company, and when these, together with twelve sub sidiary medium-wave transmitters for regional purpose s in the provinces, had been erected, the Iranian broad casting network would be complete. 6. The Tehran station has functioned daily since April 24th, and the following general r*M9fc8 can be -made about it:- The general scheme of the daily progremMse is as fallows:- (Issssi-Xiafi) 1 Rftlori . 11,30 National Anthem, announce:'-.entsi 11,48 Talk (Done®tic economy) x # C0 usie (Bttfopoan records)6 13,00 -5- KuBic In Persian. 13.15 * M Arabic. 18,50 w w Turk!sh. 13.46 * ” Ibis si an. 17.16 Second Transmission, ffeele (records, generally i^ropean) 17.45 News in Persian.

The time-t&amp;hle is not very strictly kept. If one item runs omt short of tiiae, the next one (Including news) is sometimes started ahead of schedtile. The ”signature time% or interval signal, consists of a sequence of slightly harped piano chords, in the treble register, 6. Needless to say, the whole sche ie is being mm in close conjunction with the Office for the Orientation of Public Opinion; that is to say, its object will be to reach the populace, and create loyalty to the Shah and all thatthat his regime stands fop. To give full effect to this* the government will hove to place some form of aheap receiving set within reach of the public. Up to the present the sets imported and stocked have necessarily been of the more complicated and expensive all~wave, or medium-and- short-wave, varieties, which, after the addition of very heavy duties and road taxes, are definitely luxury articles. Purliher, if the villages and smaller centres are to be reached, battery sets (and batteries) will have to be intro duced. The government are already at work on a project for the provision of receivers, and the Minister of Posts, Telegraphs and Telephones, in a recent report on the subject presented to the Off Tee for the Orientation of Public Opinion, drev^r attention to M the need for putting within the public reach low-priced receiving sets and loud speakers capable of making the programmes heard in inhabited centres’ 5 * Taking tills in conjunction with the proposal eventually to establish twelve subsidiary regional trans mitters on .i©cii urn-waves , it is evident that the intention is to iaake the Tehran programme audible to the whole of Iran on mcdiuui-waves, and to utse the short-wave transmitters (a) to feed the regional relaying stations, (b) to be heard outside Iran. It is not difficult to suppose that, once that scheme has been completed by the erection of all the stations and the obtention of a stock of cheap medium-wave receivers, the Iranian Crovemsaent will take the further step of rigging their taxation and licences to encourage ne&amp;ium-wave eats and discourage or prohibit short-wave sets and so oblige the public to listen to Tehran and prevent their listening to foreign stations. By the same reasoning, they are unlikely to go to these lengths as long as theyhave to rely on abort-waves to reach their outlying provinces, rrecise information is not yet available, b*t it seems unlikely that the 2-kilowatt station &amp;QA will be audible very far from Tehran, at any rate during daylight hours. 7. The news service is not at all satisfactory. (a) The foreign news, like that in the local press, evidently lias to pass through the bottle-neck of the Agence Pars, and is stale. (b) It is scrappy and incon*x&gt;lete. (c) The foreign language bulletin® are a waste of time, and appear to bo mere advertisement'. What foreigner, except out of curiosity, is going to listen to a part ial and belated re-hash of what he has already heard from his own country's broadcasts7 (d) The bulletins in kaxutaa French and English consist solely of items from fceuter, Havas, and a few neutral sources, the neutral ones being broadly speaking of Allied complexion; th© Osman bulletins, on the other hand, consist solely of D83 Items and neutral ones of German complexion. Doubtless the Russian ones are loaded with Tass. They occur at an inconvenient hour for listening. (©) The bulletins in Persian, which are, of course, what really matter, contain an enormous amount of DM news, but it cannot yet - on the short experience available - ae said that the 23HB items, though in the majority, sufficiently crowd out the Allied ones to form a subject for protest. But this must be watched. The source of all is acknowledged, what is radically unsatisfactory is that no intelligent attempt is made to compose a balanced r6sum6 of the important news. juxtaposingjuxtaposing th© various versions where they eoni'lict. Usually one imj^ortont incident is presented in the German form only and another incident in the Allied form only f and the result mast be quite incoherent to a listener unprovided witn a 'back ground obtained elsewhere, i.e*, to the Iranian listener to whom it shoiild be addressed. Moreover, this practice opens the way for a tendeneiou© qualitative selection, while keeping a pretence of '‘neutrality { on tlie quantitative side. This parrot like system has from the outset been th© Iranian practice in the press. But a newspaper contains rmich more than a radio bulletin, and the reader can pore at leisure over the conflict ing items and extract the meaning; the drastic selection necesss -y on the wireless may produce a very different result. 8. The male x*nglish announcer is not bad. jsut the female one, who more frequently reads the bulletin, is lamentable. 8he does not appear to be an Iranian, but an Englishwoman of imperfect education, who cannot read a sentence without tripp&amp;ng up at every comma, or pronounce words that begin with a capital letter, as well as a great many that do not. 9. It is of interest to note that a very noisy M side band H occurs (in Tehran) on either side of the medium-wave station £.*A. This completely obscures the Delhi medium-wave station ( that Ilea close to it, and therefore, amongst other things, renders the Delhi broadcasts in Iranian and Kabuli Persian totally inaudible in Tehran. The Delhi station produces no effect (in Tehran) on &amp;-j%; it is entirely the other way round.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000466.0x000351_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/397</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000466.0x000351</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/397</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>PZ 3506/40 'Inauguration of Tehran broadcasting station'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1940/1940</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-05-24T23:52:37</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (10 folios)</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence for this description commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 12; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file contains correspondence regarding Radio broadcasting in India and Iran. Included are two telegrams (folios 2 to 3) from Edward Walter Fletcher, Secretary. One is addressed from the Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department, to HM’s Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary at the Court of Iran, Tehran and proposes the building of relations between ‘All India Radio’ and publicity organisations in Iran, in particular a new radio station in Tehran. The reason of which is to limit the influence of German broadcasts from Iran, and to demonstrate the promotion of the Iranian regime in India to Iran. The second telegram is addressed to HM’s Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary at the Court of Afghanistan, Kabul and proposes cooperation with publicity organisations in Afghanistan for similar reasons. This telegram also refers to an earlier correspondence dated at 1 May 1940 which is not in the file.The main body of the file contains correspondence and a report (folios 4 to 10) from Reader William Bullard (British Ambassador at Tehran) to the Viscount Halifax at the Foreign Office detailing work undertaken by the new broadcasting station ‘Radio Tehran’. Copies of which have been forwarded to the Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department, the Ministry of Information, and to HM’s Representatives at Baghdad and Kabul; these copies are not included in the file. The report includes information regarding the hours of broadcast, individual broadcasters (including the Minister of Posts, Telephones and Telegraphs), the mechanics of frequency and transmission, current and future scheduling, and opinion on the and style and content of programming (including a negative assessment of the available news service).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><topic>Broadcasting</topic></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Indian Political Service, External Affairs Department</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Iran, Pahlavi dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Posts and Telegraphs Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Iran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Tehran</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Radio</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000466.0x000351#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
