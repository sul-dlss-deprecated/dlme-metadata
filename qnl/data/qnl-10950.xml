It argues that both have overestimated the difficultly in overcoming the natural obstruction at Ahwaz [Ahvāz], which would open the upper river to light steamers. It also argues against funding the construction of carriage roads in Persia in favour of light railways and mule roads.Included in the memorandum are two tables showing the height of various ascents along both the Shuster [Shūshtar]-Isfahan [Eşfahān] and the Bushire-Shiraz routes.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="personal"><namePart>Oliver Beauchamp Coventry St John</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Karun River</geographic></subject><subject><topic>River navigation</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000074#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
