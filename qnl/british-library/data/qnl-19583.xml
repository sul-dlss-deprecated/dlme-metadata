Topics covered include: willingness of some of the Arab Shaikhs to follow the new slave trade suppression treaty; resistance to measures on the Persian coast, and in particular at Lingah [Bandar-e Lengeh], as a result of antagonisms between British and Persian emissaries and the overhasty seizure of slaves by British Agent at Bandar-e Lengeh; the relative power of British treaties over the rulers of the Arab (or Oman] coast, compared to the Persian coast; ambiguity in Government acts relating to the seizure of vessels in Persian waters; a request for money to improve the condition of freed slaves held at Bassidore.The letter includes numerous enclosures, a list of which are included at the end of the letter (folio 223).
