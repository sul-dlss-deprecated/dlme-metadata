Questions discussed include whether the Trucial Chiefs' commitment to end illegal arms trafficking in 1902 extended to the British Government, and whether the existing permissions given by Trucial Chiefs to the British Government to patrol territorial waters would permit them to stop and search vessels;The position of Katr [Qatar] and a possible agreement between the British Government and the Chiefs of Katr, particularly the Bin Thani [Āl Thānī] family, to make the trafficking of arms illegal in Katr.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival item</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Governor of Doha</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Katr</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Trucial Coast</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Territorial waters</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100027673310.0x000004#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
