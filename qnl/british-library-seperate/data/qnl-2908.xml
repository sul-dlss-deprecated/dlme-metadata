These are followed by extensive file notes recording administrative arrangements and actions, as well as providing a list of file contents (f.31). The list records the reference numbers 1 to 4 written on some documents towards the front of the file in red crayon and encircled; also reference numbers 1 to 6 written on other documents towards the back of the file in red crayon and encircled. The reference numbers help to identify and locate these documents in the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: numbered 1A, 1B, and then 2 to 34, in pencil in the top right hand corner.

It is addressed to the Political Agents for Bahrain, Kuwait and Muscat and asks them to send him weekly summaries of any news items relating to their area, made in Arabic broadcasts by foreign radio stations.The file consists almost entirely of several English summaries of Arabic news broadcasts, transmitted to radio listeners in the Gulf States by European and Middle Eastern radio stations and expressing mainly anti-British views. Most summaries are from Berlin Radio and include news of Jewish immigration into British controlled Palestine and President Roosevelt’s peace telegram to Hitler on14 April 1939. There are also two short news summaries about Palestine from the British viewpoint, broadcast by the British Broadcasting Corporation (B.B.C.) Empire Service (known as Daventry Radio) in England.The reference number ‘1.a/25’ appears on two telegrams in the file (ff.17-18). This is a related file in the same series. There is also a cross-reference to a particular file part in a handwritten note on the file cover which says:‘Please see file 1.a/25-III for future correspondence’. This file part appears not to have survived.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Adviser to the Government of Bahrain</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Bahrain Political Agency</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">creator</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Propaganda</topic></subject><subject><topic>Public information</topic></subject><subject><topic>Intelligence operations</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000194#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
