From the enclosed correspondence'^ it will be seen that the Treasury have agreed to share with your Government the amount of the annual grant of Rs. 1,250 which you have sanctioned on this account. I confirm your pro ceedings, on the understanding that the sanction conveyed in my telegram of 10th June 1909 to the arrangements originally proposed is regarded as having lapsed ; and I request that no expenditure in excess of the annual sum of Rs. 1,250 may be incurred without a further report to me. 3. The amount actually expended on the above account should be included in the supplement to the annual statement of diplomatic Jand consular expenditure in Persia annually submitted by your Government (vide paragraph 4 of my Political Despatch No. 73, dated 30th July 1909). 1 have the honour to be, My Lord, Your Lordship’s most obedient humble Servant, (Signed) Morley of Blackburn. 10829. 1.989.A 2 10S29. INCLOSURES. Enclosure No. 1 . India Office to Foreign Office.

Recurring, 17 SI. a year, treasury to the payment from British revenues of a moiety of the cost- of improving quarantine arrangements at Bahrein, I am directed t Foreign Department, No. 148, dated ^ the Secretary of State for India 20th October 1910. to enclose copy of a letter! from the Government of India on the subject. It will be seen that the Sheikh has now expressed his willingness to pay the cost of the quarantine arrangements generally, but that expendi ture has been authorised by the Government of India of an annual sum not exceeding Rs. 1,250 (83b 6 s. Sd.) for the purposes mentioned in paragraph 1 of the Political Agent’s letter, No. 319, dated the 13th May last. In view of the probability that the proposed measures of quarantine may not suffice to prevent the occurrence of plague in Bahrein and of the undesirability, referred to in Mr. Marling’s Despatch No. 14 (Com mercial), dated the 16th May last, of bringing Bahrein into the dis cussions of the Tehran Sanitary Council, the Earl of Crewe proposes, subject to the concurrence of Secretary Sir E.

In reply to your letter No. 46,187, dated the 6 th January 1911, regarding the arrangements arrived at for the purpose of dealing with plague at Bahrein, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to explain that in the letter of this Office, dated the 21st December ‘last, it was contemplated that the annual sum, not exceeding Rs. 1,250 (831. 6 s. 8 d.), of which the Government of India had [authorised the expenditure, should be equally divisible between the British and Indian exchequers. The money in question would be expended, strictly speaking, on internal measures of plague prevention, rather than on “ quarantine arrangements,” and for this reason it seemed preferable to regard the previous sanction as having lapsed. But the principle of the equal liability of the two Governments for expenditure in dealing adequately with plague at Bahrein remains unchanged, and the Earl of Crewe would, therefore, propose, subject to the concurrence of Secretary Sir E. Grey, to include the sum actually expended, not exceeding the amount above-named, in the annual statements of diplomatic and consular expenditure of the Government of India to be presented to your Department.

'0 \ The Right Hon’ble VISCOUNT MORLEY of BLACKBURN, O.M., Bis Majesty's Secretary of State for India. Simla ; the 20th October, 1910. My Lord, We have the honour to refer to Your Lordship’s telegram, dated the 10 th June 1909, which conveyed sanction to certain proposals for placing p'ttZe our despatch No. 195 (Establishment), dated the (quarantine miangcments at Bahrein the 3rd December 1908 . on a p r0 p er footing, at an estimated initial outlay of Rs. 5,000 approximately and a recurring annual charge of about Rs. 2,664. 2. We have now to report that the Sheikh has expressed his willingness to pay the cost of the quarantine arrangements generally, but desires himself to appoint a quarantine doctor (under the advice of Government), and to have the quarantine fees collected by his own representatives, the Political Agent disbursing all expenditure. We have accordingly agreed that the cost of the quarantine arrangements * Letter from the Political Resident in the Persian -j-i uui ir -it Gulf, No. 1514 , dated the 5th June 1910, with encio- generally snoulcl be uelrayed by the Letter to the Political Resident in the Persian Sheikh OU these terms. A Copy of the Gulf, No. 3°55.Est. A ., dated the 30th September correspondence* on the subject is en closed. 3. In view of the reasons given in paragraph 5 of Lieutenant-Colonel Cox’ letter cited in the margin above, we have sanctioned an annual grant of Rs. 1,250 for expenditure in connection with plague preventive measures at Bahrein, to be utilised in the manner indicated in the Political Agent’s letter No. 319, dated the 13th May 1910. This expenditure will be met from theannual grant of Rs. 2,664, to which reference has been made in paragraph 1 above, the balance of Rs. 1,414 being held as a reserve to cover any unfore- ^ seen expenses. 4 We trust that these measures will meet with Sour Lordship’s approval. We have the honour to be, My Lord, Your Lordship’s most obedient, humble servants, tCONFIDENTIAL. No. 1514, dated Bushire, the 5th (received 13th) June 1910. From-LIEUTENANT-COLONEL P. Z. Cox, C.S.I., C I.E., Political Resident m the Persian Gulf, To—The Hon'ble Mr S. H. Butler, C.S.I, C.I E , Secretary to the Govern- ment or India in the Foreign Department, Simla. I have the honour to resume the correspondence regarding quarantine arrangements at Bahrein, ending with residency letter No. 720, dated the 20th March 1910. 2. Just before this was received in the Foreign Department, I was in Galcutta, and on verbal enquiry being made from me regarding this subject, I asked permission to defer expressing a final opinion upon the question of the ° u CO j St U ?i t ^ I returne d to my post and satisfied myself that bheikh hsa had really understood what the expenses would be when he expressed his readiness to bear the brunt of the arrangements himself. 3. I now beg to attach copies of correspondence which has passed on the subject since my return to Bushire. A perusal of it will demonstrate that Sheikh Fsa knows all the details of the expendi ture which will be required of him, and accepts the. onus generally, but that in order to satisfy his own amour propre in regard to a measure connected with his internal administration, he is anxious to appoint a quarantine doctor of his own under our advice, and to have the fees collected by his own representatives. He agrees to the Political Agent disburs ing all ex pend iture but wishes to settle accounts with him monthly instead of quarterly as was suggested to him. (1) Political Agent, Bahrein, to Resident, No. 239, dated the 16th April 1910. (2) Resident to Political Agent, Bahrein, No. 983, dated the 24th April 1910. (3) Political Agent, Bahrein, to Resident, No. 272, dated the 28th April 1910. (4) Political Agent, Bahrein, to Resident, No. 319, dated the 13th May 1910. 4. It would have been perhaps more helpful to the position which we are gradually acquiring in Bahrein if the quarantine arrangements had been entirely in our management, but one can sympathise with Sheikh Esa’s attitude and if he is ready to bear the expense, I am of opinion that it will be worth while to humour him. If he is able to flatter himself in the first instance that he is conducting the quarantine regime himself, he will probably be glad enough, when the novelty has worn off, to leave the practical management of it to his doctor and the Political Agent in concert. . 5. Supposing for a moment that Government are pleased to agree to Sheikh Esa employing a whole-time quarantine doctor himself, Captain Mackenzie would modify the items of recurring expenditure which he desires permission to debit to the annual allowance of Rs 2,664 already sanctioned by Government, and would recommend that out of that sum Rs. 1,250 per annum be retained at his disposal for expenditure as necessary in the directions explained by him. Bahrein has a bad reputation with the Sanitary Council in Teheran and is apparently regarded by them as a “ foyer ” of infection, and I therefore endorse the opinion of the Residency Surgeon that it would be desirable to have this sum available. 6. Should Sheikh Esa be permitted to appoint his own doctor, is it possible that the appointment would attract Assistant Surgeon Sahibzada Said us Zafa Khan whose desire for employment was communicated to me in Foreign Department letter No. 2764-Est.-A., dated the 14th August 1909. If so, I would request that 1 may be informed of his address, with a view to placing him in communication with the Sheikh’s Agent in Bombay. Copy of a letter No. 2 jg, dated 16 th April 19 io, from Cabtain C. F. Mackenzie, I.A. Political Agent, Bahrein, to Colonel P. Z. Cox, C.S.L, C.I.E., Political Resident m the Persian Gulf, Bushire, With reference to correspondence ending with your endorsement, No. 721, dated the 20th March 1910, I have the honour to state that I delayed inyou'wl^ethe^iTwas necessary^or u^to^oHect^qwrantine'^fee^'as^ Obeli''ve^this course would have been distasteful to Sheikh Esa. , 0n mv return to Bahrein before I had an opportunity to address Sheikh (translationrcb^df P r 7 posifg”he 1 houfd bring ^aloc^or from India. t i f QKplUh F-sa on this subiect and explained it was necessary for all he incumbent for the post, and that the pay would probably not be less than r! ,on or Ks 2co a month. He fully understood these points and said that G vernm^nf should loose the man and that he should be in regard to Quarantine matters under the control of the Assistant Surgeon m charge of the Political Agency. 3 . I cannot help thinking that with careful selection of a |' an [ or th ® p0St ; this should be a most useful step towards progression. It is unnecessary to add 'that the incumbent should be a Muhammadan an , d a re ' lable ,X' tf 0 liic able to influence the Sheikh beneficially. A man with a knowledge of A ab c would be advisable, but I hardly consider it necessary because if ‘be candidate has his heart in his work he will certainly study the language. 1 ^ u ' d have recommended Assistant Surgeon G. K. Monam, in whom I ploee great rehance, but unfortunately he gets seasick if the weather is at all rough, and ’t' s “'h- much against his will that he accepted the original proposal to take on quaran tine work in addition to his other duties. Provided the selection is a reliable man, I think he might work in direct communication with the Residency Surgeon, Bushire, and the Pohtica g , and need not be subject to the orders of the Assistant burgeon. 4. Next week I will be able to send you the Sheikh's written reply, but in the meantime the arrangements, if any are in progress for the appointment o a Hospital Assistant, may be suspended, because if the Government of approve this proposal there will be no longer any necessity for one. S. Sheikh Esa has verbally agreed to my disbursing expenditure and recovering monthly (not three-monthly), but I will forward his written reply next week. I believe also that there is some doubt in your mind as to whether Sheikh Esa is aware of the amount of the liabilities he is incurring, and i therefore have the honour to state that he has the whole estimate in w ntin g ^ initial, recurring and miscellaneous expenditure and of the fees he will be entitled to charge, and has agreed to this in his letter dated the 6th Shawwa 1327 (21st October 1909 ) forwarded with my letter No. 681 — 20, dated the 2yt October 1909 .

With reference to your letter No. 239 , dated 16 th April 1910 , I have the JLhonour to enquire whether, now that Sheikh Esa proposes to entertain a whole time quarantine doctor himself, you still consider the grant of Rs 2,664 already sanctioned by Government, needed.

To Sheikh Esa, No. 262, dated the 26th April 1910. From Sheikh Esa, dated the 17th Rabi ath Thani, 1328 (27th April 1910). 2. Sheikh Esa’s object in bringing a special doctor is for him to be able to say that he has appointed the quarantine doctor himself. In reality, however, if the suggestions are approved, the doctor would be first selected by the Government of India who could inform the Surgeon General in Bombay of their choice and terms of the contract. When Sheikh Esa’s Agent goes to the Surgeon-General with the Government of Bombay, the latter would inform the Agent of the selection and the contract could be drawn up with the approval of the Surgeon-General, Bombay. I have already ventured to express the opinion that this appears to be a good opportunity for improving Sheikh Esa’s mind, and I hope there is no insuperable objection to the present or some similar proposal. I would call attention to the fact that in the course of conversation Sheikh Esa said that if his Agent could not appoint the doctor, there was no further object in his pressing the matter, and he would agree to the Assistant Surgeon doing the work, but I think it w 7 ould be a pity to allow his proposition to be dropped if there is any chance of meeting his wishes in the matter. In conversation he told me that he did not mind to what religion the new doctor belonged, but 1 strongly hold that he should be a Muhammadan. 3. I would bring to notice that Sheikh Esa has not agreed in writing to the doctor being under the Political Agent’s control but he agreed verbally and I did not care to press the point further at the particular juncture, as it is clear that in quarantine matters he must obey my orders, and if necessary the Resi dency Surgeon can transmit his orders through me.

After compliments. —I have received your letter dated the 2nd Rabi-ath- Thani 1^28 (12th Apri 1910) regarding your wish to bring a doctor to Bahrein. As I explained to you verbally the rules regarding quarantine were drawn up by learned doctors representing the great Powers, and these rules have to be care fully carried out or otherwise difficulties will ensue. It is therefore necessary that the quarantine doctor be under the orders of the Residency Surgeon, Bushire, who passes all orders for quarantine in the Gulf and is head over the other qua rantine doctors at Lingah, Bunder Abbas, Muscat. He must also be under my orders, because I will be responsible to the High Government that the quarantine regulations are properly carried out. In respect to matters other than quarantine l do not wish to interfere with your doctor in any way whatever. I must also explain to you that it will be necessary for the man to be chosen by the High Government, so that they make sure that the doctor selected for the post is a good man and worthy of the important position of being your doctor. I think that his pay will be Rs. 200 or Rs. 250 per mensem, but of course in that case no allowance would be made by you to Mr. Monani as was arranged previously. As soon as I hear from you that you accept these pro posals I will communicate with the Political Resident in Bushire.

I will appoint for the post of the doctor, a competent man bearing good testimonials and possessing all the qualities mentioned by you. Insha Allah, he will be trusted by the High Government and by your goodself. I will also order him to obey the orders of the Residency Surgeon at Bushire who, as you say, issues orders to all the quarantines at Lingah, Bunder Abbas and Muscat regarding the quarantine regulations.

In reply to your letter No. 983, dated the 24th April 1910 (received 7th May 1910), I have the honour to suggest that the annual sum of Rs. 1,250 may be sanctioned for the prevention of plague in Bahrein, and it may be apportioned as follows (a) Construction and maintenance of segregation camp Rs.—200. (£) Disinfection of infected houses, payment to staff employed thereon, and compensation where necessary to poor people for expenses connected with their moving into segregation camp ; also cleaning up surroundings of plague centres —Rs. 500.

I would prefer Sheikh Esa to carry out the measures under direction of his quaranTine doctor (if approved) and merely give general supervision myse f Very likely he would do so and nearly the whole amount would be saved, but I wfsh to be in a position to back up advice by acts in case he grudges the extra expenditure, and as it is not a suitable moment to ask him definitely or even broach the subject to him I have ventured to ask for this provision.

Their Lordships had no intention of departing from the prac tice under which approved, expenditure on diplomatic estab lishments in Persia is at present shared between the British and Indian Exchequers. The passage in question was intended, so far as LIy Lords are concerned, to guard against any gen eral extension of the practice to places like Bahrein, winch, although situated in the Persian Gulf, are not on the Per sian ^'le Under Secretary of State foreign Office.Persian Littoral; and They adhere to the opinion that the question of the charge of expenditure incurred in regard to places so situated should be considered on the merits of each individual case. Their consent to share the cost of quarantine at Bahrein (an island which they understand may be regarded for general purposes as an. appanage of India) was based on the international considerations urged in the Foreign Office letter of the 9th March last with regard to that particular obligation. They regret, therefore, that They are not prepared to give any general undertaking for the future such as is suggested in the last paragraph of Sir A. Oodley’s letter.

With reference to your letter of the 12th. ultimo I am directed hy Secretary Sir E.

Sir E. Grey is, however, of opinion that neither in this case nor in the case of the improvements effect ed in 1907, should the division of the cost he regarded as a precedent, and that on any future occasion on which expenditure may he involved in the execution of The Under Secretary of State, India Office.(10369/09) \ any schemes in hhe Persian G-ulf, ihe proportion of the contributions to be borne by the British and Indian Exchequers respectively should be considered on the merits of the case.

WITH reference to your letter of the 18th October, 1907, and to previous correspondence on the subject of Eastern Sanitary Reforms, I am directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to transmit to you herewith, to he laid before the Lords Com missioners of His Majesty’s Treasury, copy of a letter from the India Office relative to proposals which have been made by His Majesty’s Resident and Consul-General at Bushire, for effecting an improvement of the existing quarantine arrangements at Bahrein.* It will be observed that the estimated cost of this undertaking is 333/. initial expenditure and 178/. per annum recurring, and that the Government of India are prepared to accept these proposals, provided that the cost is divided equally between the British and Indian Exchequers. It is, Sir E. Grey considers, of the greatest importance that the sanitary service in the Persian Gulf should be maintained upon a proper footing, and that the existing quarantine system should he put into as high a state of efficiency as possible, in order that any hostile criticism of the British administration of this service may be disarmed, and that no grounds may he left on which a Power whose interests were antagonistic to our own could base an accusation that work was not being carried out in a proper manner. In this connection, I am to request that you will draw their Lordships’ attention to the considerations expressed in the letter from this Office of the 16th October last, which appear to Sir E. Grey to apply in an equal degree to the present case. Bahrein is not indeed on the same footing vis-a-vis the Tehran Sanitary Council as the Persian ports on the Gulf, but this fact only renders it of additional importance that at such a place, which is directly under British influence, the quarantine service should be irreproachable. Although, as a result of the friendly relations which at present exist between this country on the one hand and France and Russia on the other, the British position in the Gulf is more secure than has been the case in the past, His Majesty s Government would not be justified in counting on such a state of affairs continuing indefinitely, and Sir E. Grey considers that no opportunity should be allowed to slip of consolidating that position in sanitary matters, so that if and when the present political position in the Gulf is modified to our disadvantage it may be possible to elmm fVin.f. +Tia wnvV is hfiine 1 * carried on in an unexceptionable manner.

WITH reference to correspondence ending with your letter dated the 14th July, 1908, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India in Council to transmit herewith, to be laid before the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, copy of a letter from the Government of India in which proposals are made for putting the quarantine arrangements at Bahrein upon a proper footing at an estimated cost of 333/. initial and 178/. per annum recurring. In view of the importance, on political and commercial grounds, of maintaining the efficiency of the present system of quarantine in the Persian Gulf, Viscount Morley would recommend, for Sir E. Grey’s consideration, that the proposals of the Govern ment of India should be accepted, on condition that the cost is divided equally between the British and Indian Exchequers. It is understood that Dr. Theodore Thomson of the Local Government Board, who has been informally consulted on the subject, is of opinion that the measures advocated by the Government of India should be adopted. I am, &amp;c. (Signed) A. GODLEY. . Inclosure 1 in No. 1. Government of India to Viscount Morley. My Lord, Fort William, December 3, 1908. WITH reference to the correspondence ending with our despatch dated the 21st May, 1908, on the subject of quarantine in the Persian Gulf, we have the honour to forward, for the consideration of His Majesty’s Government, correspondence relative to the question of putting the quarantine arrangements at Bahrein on a proper footing. 2. Your Lordship, in a telegram dated the 8 th May, 1907, approved of our action in moving the Sheikh of Bahrein to issue a Proclamation prescribing inspection by the Agency Assistant Surgeon, and arrangements were made accordingly, as reported in our telegram dated the 25th June, 1907. Major Cox now proposes that regular quarantine be enforced at Bahrein under our direct supervision, and has submitted an estimate of the necessary expenditure which, he considers, should be met from British revenues. The estimate comprises an initial outlay of 5,000 rupees approximately (apart from the cost of the stove which has been sanctioned separately) and a recurring annual charge of about 2,664 rupees, viz. :— Quarantine allowance to Assistant Surgeon Quarantine guards— 1 chief, at 25 rupees 1 4 guards, at 18 „ J Rupees. 75 a-month. The Sheikh has agreed in principle to the imposition of quarantine at Bahrein, but is unable to meet the cost in the present state of his Exchequei. . 3. We consider it desirable that the quarantine arrangements at Bahrein should be in keeping with those at other ports in the Persian Gulf, and the estimate appears [2170 £— 1 ] B jTiiis Document is the Property of His Britannic Maje sty’s Government,]'to us to be reasonable. We therefore recommend that the proposed expenditure be sanctioned on an understanding simOar to that applied in the case of other preventive measures, namely, that a moiety of the cost should be borne by His jilajesty s Govern ment, the other moiety being charged to Indian revenues.

Bushire, March 8 , 1908. I HAVE the honour to address you on the subject of quarantine arrangements at Bahrein. 2. Erom the correspondence received under your indorsement dated the 18th January, 1908, it is clear that His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India consider the question of putting quarantine arrangements in the Persian Gulf on a proper footing as one of the utmost importance, and I venture to make the following proposals, which will inevitably involve a certain expenditure on the part of Government, a portion of which, namely, the purchase of a stove, has been already sanctioned. In this connection I beg to forward a copy of a communication received from Captain Prideaux on the subject, together with a translation of a letter from the Sheikh of Bahrein to the Political Agent, agreeing in principle to the imposition of quarantine restrictions at that port. 3. As regards the cost of instituting quarantine measures, I attach herewith a Memorandum by the Residency Surgeon showing the requirements, together with the estimated cost, from which it will be seen that the initial expenditure will be 5,000 rupees (apart from the cost of stove separately sanctioned), while the recurring expenditure is estimated to amount to approximately 2,964 rupees per annum. I concur with the views expressed by the Residency Surgeon as to proposed cost, and have only the following remarks to offer by way of explanation:— (a.) The Assistant Surgeons at other Gulf ports receive 150 rupees per mensem special quarantine allowance. In view of the fact that the Assistant Surgeon at Bahrein receives a local allowance of 100 rupees per mensem, I consider 100 rupees would be a sufficient allowance for performing the functions of Port Health Officer on behalf of the Sheikh of Bahrein, in addition to his own duties. (&amp;.) Wages of Guards : Rates of wages rule extremely high in Bahrein, and as it is desirable to enlist a good class of man, as the duties are of a responsible nature, I have therefore proposed 18 rupees for the guards and 25 rupees for the Chief Guard, who would act as caretaker of the quarantine camp and mechanician. (c.) Miscellaneous charges : These will include boat hire, petty repairs to buildings, purchase of disinfectants, and various charges for which it is somewhat difficult to estimate exactly. I have estimated 600 rupees per annum for normal expenditure, but a larger expenditure which cannot be accurately foretold would naturally he incurred during epidemics. As regards quarantine fees, I suggest that the following fees, which are approxi mately the same as those levied in Persian ports, should be charged, viz.:— First class Second class Third class Rs. a. p. 7 8 0 5 0 o 2 8 0 It is impossible to estimate the receipts which will be recovered on account of fees, as no ships are regularly in quarantine, and there is no basis on which to frame an estimate. In any case, except during an epidemic, receipts will not be large, and need hardly be taken into consideration.4. ^eikh Esa has given a suitable piece of ground for a quarantine station, but Captain Pndeaux considers, ana I concur with his opinion, that in the present state of the Bahrein Exchequer it will be impossible to get money out of the Sheikh for general expenses, and therefore respectfully urge upon the Government of India the advisability of adopting the suggestion made by Captain Prideaux in paragraph 2 of his communication, and taking direct charge of the quarantine at Bahrein As I have shown above, this will only mvolve an initial cost of 5,000 rupees and a recurring annual charge of 3,000 rupees, a small sum compared to the advantages to be derived f rom a direct administration of the quarantine by ourselves. Inclosure 3 in No. 1 . Memorandum from the Residency Surgeon to the Political Resident. ASSUMING that the provisions of the Paris Convention will be enforced at Bahrein as at other Gulf ports, I should consider the following provision of buildin 0 *, staff, &amp;c., sufficient:— (A.)— Buildings, 8 fc. 1. First-class Passengers .—One good room, with dressing room and bath room, to hold two beds. Tables, chairs, &amp;c., should be provided. A small kitchen would also be necessary. All food, utensils, cook, &amp;c., should he provided by passengers’ friends in Bahrein. 2. Second-class Passengers .—Two rooms with the necessary furniture. They could use the first-class kitchen. A latrine should be provided for these rooms. 3. Third-class Passengers .—Huts should be built to accommodate the average number of third-class passengers arriving in Bahrein by the steamer which is always in quarantine (if there is one), or the one which is most likely to be in quarantine. Huts would have on this basis to be built for about thirty passengers. Arrange ments for expansion during epidemics would be necessary in addition. This could be met by the local purchase of matting and putting up mat huts. Theoretically a common latrine should also be provided for the third-class passengers, but practically it would be of no use, as the quarantine station is on the water’s edge. 4. An encircling hedge of date sticks will he necessary. 5. A small building to contain the disinfecting stove. 6 . The following chemicals may be provided at the start, together with a few tubs and wooden buckets. Also six syringes and a dozen mops :— Methylated spirit .. .. .. .. .. .. 20 gallons. Perchloride of mercury .. .. .. .. .. .. 20 lbs. Carbolic acid (pure) .. .. .. .. .. .. 20 lbs. 7. Annual contingent allowance of 600 rupees to be used for meeting the monthly petty expenses, and for certain expenses such as hire of a boat for transporting passengers to quarantine, small repairs to quarantine station, &amp;c. (B.)— Staff, Sc. 1. There should be five quarantine guards, one of whom should be caretaker of the quarantine station and also mechanician. 2. Boat for landing passengers. This could probably be arranged for in normal times out of the contingent allowance. During epidemics it would be better to have the same boat in use, and to pay by the trip.

WITH reference to my letter dated the 19th August, 1907, on the subject of the institution of quarantine precautions in Bahrein, I have the honour to report that Sheikh Esa-bin-Ali has at last, after some discussion, notified to me his concurrence regarding the medical inspection of steamers by the Agency Assistant Surgeon and the maintenance of a quarantine detention camp. A translation *f uis letter, dated the 8 th October, 1907, is inclosed. 2 . With regard, however, to the expense of laying out the camp and constructing the necessary buildings, I fear that the Chief will resist strongly any application for funds, as Ms financial condition is so embarrassed nowadays. I recommend, therefore, that the G-overnment of India should finance the operations and receive all the fees for detention in camp and for the grant of health certificates to persons leaving Bahrein in times of epidemic disease until such period as the Chief may notify Ms willingness to take over the total cost of maintenance. 3 . In view of the special position of dependence that the CMef of Bahrein occupies with regard to the Government of India as compared with the Rulers of the other ports in the Persian Gulf where quarantine is maintained, I trust that this proposal will not be considered objectionable. Its adoption, I believe, will certainly save us from some friction at tbe start, and will appreciably expedite the efficiency of the working arrangements. 4. The duties of visiting all vessels arriving in the port, superintending the detention camp, and treating patients therein, wOl entail a heavy increase of work upon the Assistant Surgeon in charge ; I recommend therefore that he may be granted a special allowance, such as is given, I understand, to the other quarantine officers in the Gulf ports. The number of huts and the strength of the medical staff required to be employed in this connection would appear to be similar to those existing in Linga and Bunder Abbas. I request therefore that tbe recommendations of the Residency Surgeon may be obtained on these points. Inclosure 5 in No. 1 . Sheikh Esa-bin-Ali to Captain Pridemur. (Translation.)

You say that the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf has asked you to advise me to institute a simple quarantine arrangement, such as has been adopted in Muscat and Koweit. and which will satisfy the Governments of the neigh bouring Powers whose subjects have trade relations with ^Bahrein. I am much obliged for this resolution of the British Government, and my opinion is that this is desirable and a thing for the public good and a cause for being saved from the plague. As soon as I received your letter I ordered one of my servants to accompany the (Agency) doctor to choose one of the three places wMch should be a suitable quarantine station.

(5) A small building to contain the disinfecting stove, ( 6 ) The following chemicals may he provided at the start, together with a few tubs and wooden buckets. Also six syringes and a dozen mops:— (3) Methylated spirit . Perchloride of mercury Carbolic acid (pure) . 20 gallons. 20 lbs. 20 lbs. (7) Annual contingent allowance of Rs. 600 to be used for meeting the monthly petty expenses, and for certain expenses such as hire of a boat for transporting passengers to quarantine, small repairs to quarantine station, etc. B. — Staff, etc. (1) There should be five quarantine guards, one of whom should be caretaker of the quarantine station and also mechanician. ( 2 ) Boat for landing passengers. This could probably be arranged for in normal times out of the contingent allowance. During epidemics it would be better to have the same boat in use, and to pay by the trip.4 The number of huts and the strength of the menial staff required to be employed in this connection would appear to be similar to those existing in Linga and Bandar Abbas. I request, therefore, that the recommendations of the .Residency Surgeon may be obtained on these points. Translation of a letter from Sheikh Esa bin Ali, Al Khalifa, Chief of Bahrein, to Captain E. B. Pbideaux, Political Agent, Bahrein, dated the ^October 1907‘ After Compliments.—I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter, dated the and to say that I have been duly informed of what you conveyed to me. You say that the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf has asked you to advise me to institute a simple quarantine arrange ment, such as has been adopted in Maskat and Koweit, and which will satisfy the governments of the neighbouring Powers, whose subjects have trade rela tions with Bahrein. I am much obliged for this resolution of the British Government, and my opinion is that this is desirable and a thing for the public good, and a cause for being saved from the plague. As soon, as I received your letter I ordered one of my servants to accompany the (Agency) Doctor to choose one of the three places which should he a suitable quarantine station. The said Doctor has selected one of these places. Now remains consultation with you about the (particulars of the) arrangements which insa-ctllah will be done on our meeting together. The translation which you sent me enclosed in your letter (under reference) of certain extracts of the sections of the International Agreement signed by the Great Powers in Payis, was duly received by me and I have been informed of the contents. 0.1.

Though few ships come to Bahrein the duty is arduous, as ships lie a very long way out, and it was for this reason that I suggested one hundred rupees. If this is considered too much, perhaps half (?) the allowance paid to other Assistant Surgeons, viz., Rs. 75 might be given to the Bahrein man.1908. FOIiEICrN 3DEPA.HTME3SIT. FORT WILLIAM.
