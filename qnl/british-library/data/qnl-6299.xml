I telegraphed asking you and Baghdad to enquire from Giooalas whether he had any knowledge of any of his brokers haring received or attempted to obtain brokerage on purchases on our behalf from the merchants of Kuwait as well as that paid by Gorernment, because I recently learnt that Salih Sasoon ttahlab, who made certain purchases for Mr. Giocalas had demanded, and in some cases received, an half per cent, brokerage from the merchants from whom he was buying in consideration of which he increased the prices paid for the goods. The matter came to light through some of the parties being unwilling to pay him as much aa an half and talking about it. At my request the Shaikh put Salih in i prison pending enquiries and Judging by the number 1 and standing of persons who hare interested themselves on his behalf the swindle was a fairly widespread one in which all and sundry had a hand. I do not suppose that under the circumstances any eviionce 7 /ill be forthcoming but In the meanwhile he is better out of Kuwait and I should be much obliged if you oould get a surety in Basrah that he will not leave Basrah and be available at any time if wanted. I will communioate with you later regarding his eventual disposal. Captain., Political Agent, Kuwait. Copy to: Civil Commissioner, Baghdad. A.L^ rora. political Ivuv/aft.

Following official enquiries, the suspicion that Salih Sasoon Mahlab (also spelt Nahlab) was charging excessive brokerage on goods he bought from Kuwait merchants and sold to British Government officials, was disproved and he was allowed to return to Kuwait and resume his business. The main correspondents are Shaikh Salim El Mubarak as Subah [Āl Ṣabāḥ, Shaikh Sālim bin Mubārak], Captain Percy Gordon Loch, the British Political Agent, Kuwait and Lieutenant Colonel Evelyn Berkeley Howell, the Deputy Civil Commissioner, Basra. The petition from Salih Sasoon Mahlab to the Ruler of Kuwait and the letters exchanged between the Ruler of Kuwait and the British Political Agent at Kuwait are in Arabic.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="personal"><namePart>Salih Sasoon Mahlab</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Deputy Civil Commissioner</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Kuwait</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Deportation</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0003b1#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
