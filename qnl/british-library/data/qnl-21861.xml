I was really sorry to know that your brother Nasir bin Qasim al Thani received serious bruises owing to his fall from the animal. I would have.been very pleased in- deed to have obtained the Shaikh of Bahrain's permission for his landing and brought him here along with the other two men had your letter reached me just a little earlier.

Under tnese circumstances.I am sorry to say that your brother iMaslr bin Qasim al Thani may return to Doha and stay there until I have been able to communicate with the Shaikh of Bahrain and obtain his permission .for his landing, as the condition of the two injured men is rather precarious and delay in bringing them to Bahrain may cause serious conseequences, the launch is sent forthwith to bring them.

Petroleum Concessions (Qatar) Limited, Bahrain.lb Outbreak of fire at R.A.F. Petrol Store outside Doha. 0O0 On 4th August 1937, about 5.30 p.m.^Jassim Mohammad came to my house and informed me about the accident. I prepared a draft telegram and at once went- to Dr. Holmes who had gone to the Adviser's to play tennis, to ask his advice whether I should show the text of the telegram to the Air Liaison Officer, Wing Commander Rickards, and ask him what action he, the Air Liaison Officer, had proposed to take. 2. Dr. Holmes agreed to it. T went with Jassim to the Air Liaison Officers house and when he could not be found there I went to Umm al Hassam in his search. I met him on the way near Umm al Hassam and had a talk with him. First he did not like the idea of my reporting the matter to the Political Agent and said:- 'Oh No, I should not worry him (Captain Hickinbotham). We don't care at all for the loss. It was a collection of old tin of petrol leaking and we did not mind that they were burnt. n But then he asked me to show the text to him. I read it out and he after all agreed, requesting me to add: 'Air Liaison Officer is informing Air Headquarters and endeavouring to persuade Qatar subjects to come to Bahrain for medical treatment'. 3. The following day (5th August 1937) the Air Liaison Officer called at the Agency. I received him in P.A's Court room. He told me that he had sent a telegram to Air Headquarters asking them to send 2 'planes in order to bring the three injured from Qatar and that, if the planes reached Bahrain, he/-; V -2- he would fly to Qatar and would ask us for a letter of good offices to the Shaikh of Qatar. He further adaed that the Adviser had agreed to their entry into Bahrain. As a matter of fact he had already mentioned to me on the previous day about the letter of good offi ces and I had consulted Dr. Holmes about it and he had agreed to the Air Liaison Officers request. The Air Liaison Officer further told me that he would ring me up when the planes came and I should arrange for the letter. 4. I was waiting all the afternoon for his message. But I got none. On 6th August 1937 he came to the Agency again at 8 A.M. asking for the letter. I had gone to Dr. Holmes and when I came back I came to know that the Air Liaison Officer had been here. I at once had the letter prepared and sent to the aerodrome at Muharraq at the hands of Jassim and it reached him-just in time. I did not sign the letter but preferred to have it signed by the Air Liaison Officer as Jassim had told me that the Political Agent had authorised him to sign letters of good offices in P.A's behalf. 5. At 6.30 p.m. when I was ready to go to Rufa I thought it better to make enquiries whether any news had been received of 5 the Air Liaison Officer T s return with the injured. Luckily I was informed that the Air Liaison Officer had come back at about 6 p.m. with one injured who was admitted to Victoria Memorial Hospital. 6. I dashed to the Hospital, found the man lying in a bed with his hands and legs dressed up and talking all right. I had a pleasant,encouraging talk with him welcoming him to Bahrain^and took his leave. Dr-Holmes whom I very badly wanted to see was not in the Hospital. But I gave strict instructions to the dresser Faraj (wh6/-who had accompanied the Air Liaison Officer to Qatar and to had come back with him) as well as_/the Compounder to look thoroughly well after the man so that he should go back to his place with pleasant associations about us. 7. My next move was that I came to the Agency and rang up the Air Liaison Officer to get further news from him. Of course,dresser Faraj had given me a brief version of their adventure before. 8. The Air Liaison Officer, without my asking him for the news, related to me the whole story on the telephone ^ namely; (i) He had brought one man, namely, Abdullah Darv/ish, in the plane. (ii) The other two were seriously injured and could not be brought in the plane. The condition of one of the two was precarious and it was doubtful if he would survive. (iii) He had arranged with Mr.Lermitte to send Petroleum Concessions Limited*s launch to bring the two in jured. The launch would meet them at Ras Laffan where he had instructed them to come from Doha and wait for the launch. (iv) He had a letter from the Shaikh of Qatar, in reply to ours which we had given to the Air Liaison Offi cer, asking us to arrange for the medical treatment of his brother Nasir bin Qasim. (v) The Shaikh's letter was given by the Air Liaison Officer to Jassim for delivery to me. (vi) He asked me to come to his house and said that he would arrange to gt the letter back i from Jassim and hand it over to me. 9.. I went to the Air Liaison Officer's house. I opened the letter. The Shaikh had thanked us and the Air Liaison Officer for the arrangements made for bringing his men. He also had asked us either to send a doctor to treat his brother Nasir bin Qasim who had a fall from an animal (on enquiry it was found that he had a fall from a horse in one of the native races) or to bring him to Bahrain. 10. The Air Liaison Officer told me that Dr.Holmes, whom he had already seen about it, was not willing to go. As for the/-the dresser, he added, the man T 3 leg was swollen and the dresser could not very well diagnose whether it was a frac- ture or what. Therefore he decided that tmc m£in should be brought to Bahrain and nr had also asked olu ijooi - bi to // ^ come with the two injured men to Ras Laffan in order to come to Bahrain. He had approached the Adviser for Bahrain Go vernment's permission for his landing and the Adviser had told him that he was not sure if His Highness would agree to it and that if a request in writing was made by the Agency for the permission the Adviser would put it before His Highness and that without a written request he would not take any stion. 11. The Air Liaison Officer asked me to make the re quest in writing to the Bahrain Government but I told him that in hqc view of the fact that the relations between Bahrain and Qatar were rather strained, I would not risk any measure which might prejudice His Highness or cause his displeasure, without the express permission of the Poli tical Agent. 12. Then he asked me to get in touch with His Highness direct. But I did not agree to it on three grounds: firstly^ I was not authorised by the Political Agent to communicate with His Highness; secondly, I was not sure if such a nego tiation would be welcomed by His Highness,' and thirdly^ the Aaviser had already been asked about it and any direct or independent gesture on my part was likely to hurt him. 13. Then the Air Liaison Officer asked me to speak to the Aaviser about it because apparently he had failed to persuade him. I did not want to speak to the Adviser with out first referring to Dr. Holmes. But I found that my xxi aloofness did not impress the Air Liaison Officer who was rather insistent upon my talking to the Adviser. And as/-4 -5- n as it was a matter of no great magnitude I tried to get him on the telephone but he had gone out and I could not get in touch with him. 14. It was, after all, decided that I should reply to the Shaikh of Qatar 1 s letter regretting that because his letter reached me late, it was not possi le or me to communicate with Sis Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain to obrfcain permission for the brother of the Shaikh of Qatar and that the letter should be delivered to Mr. Lermitte whose launch was to sail before dawn for ( atar. 15. I came to the Hospital in search of Dr. Holmes but he had gone out to the Jebel for the pictures and there was no chance of his returning till midnight. 16. Here I found myself between the devil and the deep sea. On the one side there was a wild brother of the wild Shaikh of Qatar waiting nearly midway between Qatar and Bahrain at Ras Luffan for a launch from Bahrain to fetch him and there lurked the danger of his inhospitable arrival in a hostile land if no news were received by him to the contrary; and on the other xxnat the responsibility of an unauthorised action. I chose the lesser evil and decided that I should write the letter and hand it over to : Ir.uer- mitte because the condition of the other two men was ^ery bad ana they could not be delayed lor the sake of 1 asir bin Qasim, the brother of the Shaikh of Qatar, who was not so seriously injured and the launch had to go with all the possible haste. At 10 p.m. the letter was completed, signed b me for the Political Agent, and sent to ¥r. Lermitte under a forwarding demi-official letter. 17. On the 7th August 1957 I consulted Dr. Holmes r about it and he said that I was all right in writing the letter. I told him that the Adviser insisted upon a letter from us for the permission and that I would not like to write//&lt;? -6- rite it without P.A f s permission. But he said that it was all right. Anyhow, I did not write the letter and preferred to see the i^dviser^and Dr. Holmes also agreed to it. 18. I went to Jthe Adviser. He 'g- that it was ft not necessary to wcite a letter and that he would try to get His Highness on the telephone and obtain his permission. He also added that i^n-nj'ii, n 'n!jrrimmua ond Shaikh. Abdullah (borther^ of His Highness) coming to see him and he vould aiscuss the matter with as it was not likely that His Highness would accede to permission without consulting his brothers. He told me that he would let me know the result of his conversa tion with His Highness and his brothers.- 19. I might add, in the end, that according to Abdullah Darwish ! s version of the accident as related to me by him - self^the petromax lamp was at the entrance of the store. It may be recalled that, according to my first informa tion (please peruse telegram No.224)^the lamp was kept outside. ■ I 8th August 1957. 'i -J:CONFIDENTIAL.

Passport Officer was all the time insisting upon my writing a letter to him ordoring him to allow the men and I was quite pre- oared to shoulder the responsibility but thought that it would annoy Adviser who might think that I was superseding him and interfering with his authority. It was with great difficulty, after all, that I managed to get in touch with the Adviser and obtain his permission. 5. Nasir is staying in the house I arranged for hiui. Pte asked us the loan of an electric fan and I let him have one which was lying in the Confidential Office and was not wanted there. 4. I paid him courtesy visit on the 10th August at 7 p.m. which lasted for about quarter of an hour. Nasir seemed rather pleased and thankful for the arrangements we made for him. 5. Regarding the cause of his pain, the following con versation which took place between us would clarify the position:- I. What sort of a pain had you got? Nasir. It is in the joint of the hip (pointing to his right ^ hip). I. N. How did you get it? I had a fall from a horse. One day when I was riding a horse, I wanted to turn it to the right but the horse was scared of the people and ran and I fell on my right. Were there lot of people when you rode the horse and had a fall? Yes: we had a parade of the horses- Is the pain chronic or a new thing? It is not old: I had it only a week before the battle (of Zubarah) I. N. I. N.T . Do you hL.v(. norse parages very often in your place or now and then? N. henevcr tnere is a battle v.e have horse parades in advance. 6. From this it would ap ear that the injury, aithouglj not sustained during the fight, was caused in preparation of tie combat.

It is true that in an emergency the presence of the R.A.F. at Bahrain would assist In its defence but the main object of an R.A.F. depot at j^ahrain is because it is a conYcnlent stage on the route along the Arab side, un the other hand the only reason for the depot at 'iatar is to defend that state against aggression. 3 # if you have no objection, therefore, please address the iihaikh of Qatar making no mention of the position at Bahrain (which we can keep in case it occurs to the Shaikh) but merely using the argument of the defence of ^atar. 4.

I suggested that they call on the Sheikhs but the General demurred to this on the ground that it would take too much time. 2. I gathered from Group-Captain Harris that the appropriate Political authority had not been apprised by the Military or Air Fferce authorities of the imminent execution of this scheme;and I ventured to suggest to him that the sooner this was done,the bettfer.He said that he would see to that aspect of it.It is almost inevitable,as,of course,you are aware, that because of the talking and listening abilities of the people here, the Sheikhs will hear of the scheme before they can be approached by the Political authorities.Perhaps therefore,you will think it advisable to inform the Hon*ble the Political Resident of what is afoot.In any case I think it better that you should know of it.It seems advisable that the Sheikhs should be approached soon as possible^**} to invite their co-operation and to settle the terms on vhich it is to be given.

Fumber of guards now recommended is based on practical requirements ascertained locally and compares with 45 guards plus 3 headguards now employed Sharjah. Shaikh of Dubai requested 100 guards but after discussion agreed to reduced number. Pay recommended is 50 % greater than Sh^rjah but Shaikh expects not less than this. As Shaikh of )harjah receives Fs 800 per mensem as rent for aerodrome and Shaikh of Dubai is giving land free I urge strongly that rates of pay recommended be sanctioned. 1egret that misleading information supplied to me at Bahrain led me in first instance to Under estimate number of guards required. - Political i^vJ- t* 5 (. 37/2 Telegram ft i From To Repeated No. Dated Political 'gent, Bahrain.

IhMGOVERNMENT OF BAHRAIN. Confidential, D.O. No. 329/10/31. I^Hr \y Jy Bahrain, March 4, 1942. / I have reason to 'believe that the Royal Air Force are considering the possibility of using the local hospital facilities in Manamah for British hospital cases in the event of a de tachment of the Royal Air Force being stationed here. When the Chief Engineer from Habbanieh visited Bahrain some time ago and discussed with me the details of the work which the Bahrain Government is carrying out at Muharraq for the Royal Air Force he brought with him a senior R.A.F. medical officer who made some enquiries about local hospitals. I referred him to Dr. Snow who had a conversation with him. After a discussion with Dr. Snow I suggested he should write me a report embodying his ideas about treat ment of Royal Air Force personnel in the govern ment hospital so that if the Bahrain government was officially asked to assist in this matter we should have a plan ready for this enentuality. I enclose a copy of Dr. Snow^ report. We could now provide 2 beds for officers and 9 beds for other ranks but for the 9 bed ward it would * .-miqf -2- would be necessary to make certain alterations to the existing sanitary arrangements which are not suited to Europeans. It would also 'be neces sary to build a separate kitchen and sterilising room. All this could be done but if it is going to be necessary we would like as long notice as possible To provide an additional 12 beds another ward would have to be added to the hospital with lavatories etc. attached. It would be possible to do this work if some of the building material was obtained through the Royal Air Force. At present there are no steel beams, sanitary fittings, pipes or cement available in Bahrain nor have we any spare electric fans. ^ m I am sure that His Highness Shaikh Salman would, if the matter was explained to him, be anxious to assist the British Government by making available the medical resources which he has at his disposal therefore I would be much obliged if you could ascertain whether it is probable that the Bahrain Government may be asked in the near future to help to provide hospital facilities for the Royal Air Force in Bahrain. E. B. Wakelielf, Esqr., I.G.S., H.B.M's Political Agent, Bahrain.GOVERNMENT OF BAHRAIN. MEDICAL DEPARTMENT. Confidential * Ref. No. The Adviser to, The Government of Bahrain, Bahrain, Persian Gulf* Government - Hospital, Bahrain, Persian Gulf, 26th February 1942. Memo • R.A.F. HOSPITALISATION IN BAHBAIN. I This report has been drawn up because of certain leading questions asked recently by two R.A^F* medical authorities, as to how far the Bahrain Hospitals could deal effectively with the routine inpatient diseases of a large number of men who might be stationed nere shortly. In the event therefore of this happening, it is extremely necessary that facilities for Hospital^sa- -tion of their routine sick, should be planned and prepared now in advance. It has been gathered that the officers and men will very largely be completely unused to the East, and Malaria and Heat Exhaustion will probably account for large numbers of in patients. Their own medical aid will be equivalent to outpatient treatment using their own supplies. Anything outside this scope will necessitate using one of the Hospitals. While on an average, daily inpatients would not amount to more than one to three, and chiefly for minor disabilities which could be quickly dealt with, yet it is in the seasonal epidemic times that a good deal of strain would be put on the Hospitals. These would be Malaria in the peak months of May and June, and Heat Exhaustion, Prickly heat and boils, from July to September. The enclosed statements from the American Mission Hospital and the Government Hospital show a possible accommodation for about 50 patients at any one time in the Manama locality, if the suggested additional measures can be complied with. This number of beds is the barest minimum which could in any way deal with the demand. At present only about 30 beds could be located from both hospitals, but with no special European dieting facilities, and an arrangement for this would have to be immediately put in hand to make this accommodation properly effective. To summarise 1. Statements are enclosed from the Manama Hospitals. (It is understood that Dr.R.A.Kennedy of Awali Hospital) (can also put forward facilities for inpatients. ) 2. 30 beds can be offered from Manama, with only the dieting arrangements to make effective. 3. 20 more beds can be offered if certain renovations and building are carried out. 4. 50 beds would be the barest minimum effective. 5. Another 15 beds would ensure safe accommodation always. Zb' x-V W ,GOVERNMENT OF BAHRAIN. MEPICAL DEPARTMENT. BAHRAIN GOVERl^ENT HOSPITAL SCHEIE.

Will you kindly convey to the R. A* F# officials the following statement as to our capacity for in-patients from that service 1. Twenty beds can 'be made available for these men as soon as they are wanted. These are served by two latrines, two showers, one tub bath. The rooms are wired and 220V A.C. electricity is available. Only two or three of the beds are served by overhead fans. Three or four desk fans are available in addition. 2. Ten additional beds can be made available by renovating a block of individual rooms. This block is in active use at present, being used for Arabs. V/ithout renovation these rooms are unsuitable for British patients. 3. The cost of this renovation will be about R 2500-0-0. It will be necessary to ask the R. A. F. to carry the cost of this renovation, if they feel that these additional rooms are required. 4. The American Mission Hospital can quote an inclusive rate of Rs 10-0-0 per day per patient. This includes food, hospital care, ordinary medicines, and Minor operations. Particularly expensive medicines, such as Neo-Salvarsan, M. and B. 693, etc., as also Ma^jor . operations are to be separately arranged for. 5. These accommodations, arrangements, and prices, are regarded as suitable for and applying to, the men of the R. A. F. We very much prefer not to attempt to provide for the Officers. They can be better accommodated at the Awali Hospital. It is a very great pleasure to offer to the R. A. F. men all the facilities that we have. Any service that we can render to the R. A.

I approac ed the Bahrain Government accordingly and received the assuranc that they would provide reliable local guards when required. The position is, therefore, that guards when required are supplied by the Bahrain Government and are pold for by the Royal Air Force. . //3 3. In this connexion may I also draw your attention to your predecessor's secret memorandum No.ALO/R/1 dated the 14th February 1942 in which he Informed me that the Adviser to the Bahrain Government had been asked to arrange for necessary guards for the explosive material expected at that time. I am not aware how many guards were asked for at that time, or what pay was to be given to them, but no doubt you have this information in your records. 4. If you are not satisifed with the protective arrangements no'^ in force I suggest that the position be reviewed by yourself, or other competent Royal Air Force / authoritylh—WMte 1 -2- authority, and that you ask the Adviser to the Bahrain Government to provide such additional number of guards ^ as may be considered necessary. 5.

It would 'be appreciated if the additional works referred to in respect of the Bahrain Government Hospital could be carried out in toto in accordance with the proposal made therein. It is submitted for consideration that a daily charge for airmen, inclusive of all treatment, may he made on the 'basis of a flat rate 'between the ranges of fees quoted. This point was discussed by Dr. Snow and the Principal Medical Officer, R.A.?, in 'Iraq, at their recent meeting. In regard to the American Mission Hospital it was agreed by Dr. Harrison during his interview with the o • » P,M.O. that the existing accommodation in the Administrative Block would be made available for airmen, if required, up to an approximate number of 15 cases. This accommodation does not require any additional works construction. The total of accommodation so provided between both hospitals will, it is considered, be sufficient for R .A,?, needs. The fees suggested by Dr. Harrison are agreed to. With regard to the comments of the Adviser, Bahrain Government, quoted at paragraph 3, the Chief Engineer is at present on a visit to Bahrain and will advise as tomaterials which can 'be supplied frou 1Z.A.P, sources.

Wakefield Esquire, I.C.S., Political Agent, Bahrain. The Adviser to the Government, Bahrain. I have the honour to state that the Royal Air Force desire to purchase additional land on Muharraq Island. The land Is designated, on a plan recently prepared by the Land Department of the Bahrain Govern ment, as 'Land under Negotiation'. 2. If the Bahrain Government are prepared to sell this land - and I trust that they will be willing to assist the Royal Air Force In the matter - will you kindly have the necessary sale deed prepared. It Is understood that the price will be at the same rate as was agreed upon when the Royal Air Force recently purchased land of similar quality In the neighbourhood. I have the honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient servant. 6^ if Political 'Agent, Bahrain.* - were contemplated at present such as existed at Sharjah. They thought, in the circumstances, that 10 guards (for whom rifles are now on their way^ would oe fully sufficient, and the number could be increased pro portionately as the construction programme develops. 2. A.O.C. said that he would willingly buy any rifles which we could secure from any source for the arming of these guards. It was necessary however either that ammunition should be purchased with the rifles or that rifles purchased should take .oCS ammunition# The A.O.C.' spoke to me yesterday about accommo dation for approximately 100 members of operating crews at Muharraq should the military situation require the station ing of R.A.F. squadrons in the island. He said it was essential that these operating crews should be f it and alert, and they must be able to get at least 6 hou^s 3-eep during the 24 hours of the day. For this purpose he con sidered air-conditioned accommodation essential. -ne problem was discussed with Mr.Belgrave also. He was opposed to the hiring of Arab houses in Muharraq since the ceilings were high and there were many windows and 't^he genera-t -lay out was unsuitable for air-conditioning. it was decideJ after discussion that stone dormitories should be built in a suitable location (i.e. suitable in regard to water-supply and proximity to the aerodrome) and that A.O.C. would make every effort to get the necessary air-conditioning plant. Details were to be discussed with Colonel Panet C^E,R.A.F. 2. A.O.C. asked whether the Bahrain Government could help with air-conditioning plant if his attempts to procure these failed. The total number of air -conditioning units, both public and private owned, is only 50 and it is doubtful whether any substantial help in this direction could be given from local resources. Most of the air- conditioning units available are very small and can only / dealdeal with about 800 cubic feet. The best units are in the A .L .O.'s house, but A.0,C. thought that they would be required there for head quarters staff. 3. It is to be remembered that air-con ditioning units will only work 16-hours out of the 24 and that., if the dormitories are to be kept permanently cool^reserve units will have to be installed. I discussed with A .O.C. yesterday (P.R., Air Commodore Digby-Johnson and Mr.Bel- grave were present) the question of raising levies for the protection of aerodromes at Bah- rain Sharjah and Dubai. About 240 levies per aerodrome are required. Mr.Belgrave said that a good class of men was available in Bah rain - the class from which the Special Police at Awali had been recruited. A.O.C. said he would try to provide one officer per company of 120 men, Mr.Belgrave said he had two N.C.O.s in his Regular Police who might make good officers. Between 400 and 500 suitable candidates might be recruited in Bahrain. On • % my forthcoming tour to the Trucial Coast I will * • enquire about possibilities of recruitment at Sharjah and Dubai. It was suggested that terms of service should be fcrr^2 years and that pay should be fixed at a suitable rate for local • ^ • • service plus an allowance for service outside the employee^ own country e.g. a native of Bahrain might receive R525/- per mensem plus free food clothing etc. while serving in Bah rain and an additional Rs5/- per mensem if they were to serve at some other place in the Gulf. A.C.c, is going to send down the of.; icer v.ho/ .2. A * who has been commanding the Iraq Levies (who are mairly Assyrians and Christians) so that he could examine local material and give a considered opinion of its quality. A .O.C. thought he could provide suf icient arms for the numbers required at Bahrain in the first instance. 2. Mr. Belgrave said that the diving season was begin ning and he advised that steps should be taken immeuia --j to ask for recruits and to get their names registered ana to have them medically examined. It was considered, however, that such a step would be premature until the Officer CommandK ing the Iraq Levies had visited Bahrain and formed his views. It 11/4/42. -Ctttiv ivto AucjftKi,js[&lt;^ . u U-V '-It (jt, 1 '-^v ^ ^ ['k J ccu IM U % 9^ During my visit to Sharjah I discussed with Khan Sahib Abdur Razzak the question of recruiting levies for the protection of the aerodromes at Dubai and Sharjah. The Residency Agent stated that in his opinion the local Shaikhs and populace would not object to Iraq levies being stationed at Dubai or Sharjah to begin with even if they were Assyrian Christians; but if Iraq levies were sent to Dubai or Sharjah it would be necessary for them to live at the military camp and not in the town and they would have to be less as levies than as a branch of the army. If only a few Iraq levies were sent in order to show what was required of local recruits there would be no local objection.2, The Residency Agent thought that sufficient men of the right type would be available from Dubai and oharjah but he said The recruits would be used to the handling of arms but would not be used to discipline, i'he Residency Agent said that along the coast there was excellent material to be found from among the Baluchis. He said that if 10 or 12 really good men could be recruited at the beginning others would quickly follow. He did not suppose that the full number could be recruited straightaway but he thought that if a few good men were attracted to begin with there would be no difficulty, after a few weeks, in recruiti ing the necessary number. 3. The Residency Agent said that the pay must be good in order to attract the right type of man. He did not think that local re cruits would, initially at any rate, agree to serve elsewhere in the Gulf. He said that recruitment should, in the first instance, be for local service only. He thought that if things went well there would be no difficulty at a later stage in transfeiiring men to other places on the Persian Gulf. He was definite, however, that recruits would not come forward in the first instance for service outside their own local areas. The Residency Agent thought that pay should be Rs 30/- or Rs35/- per mensem plus free rations, free uniform and free accommodation. The last item, he said, would present ft© difficulties as the local Baluchis would gladly sleep in the cheapest kind of they would require a good deal of training. barrasti hut. 23/4/42.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000073_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/2/268</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000073</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/2/268</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>‘File 7/2 VI Landing grounds and seaplane anchorages’</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1937/1942</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2014-07-02T00:05:28</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">ara</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 volume (298 folios)</extent><extent>The contents of the volume are arranged in approximate chronological order, from the earliest items at the front of the volume to the latest at the rear.

The principle correspondents in the file are the Political Resident, the Political Agent at Bahrain, the Political Officer on the Trucial Coast, and representatives of the Royal Air Force [RAF] and Imperial Airways (referred to after 1939 as the British Overseas Airways Corporation [BOAC]).Correspondence in the first part of the volume (folios 1e-50) concerns a fire at the RAF petrol store at Doha in August 1937, resulting in serious burns to a number of men. Some of this correspondence also refers to an injury to Nasr bin Jassim [Nasr bin Jāsim Āl Thānī], brother of Shaikh ‘Abdullāh bin Jāsim Āl Thānī, the ruler of Qatar, suffered while riding his horse during a parade prior to travelling to Zubarah to fight against the Bahraini forces. Agreement was reached between British Government officials and the Adviser to the Bahrain Government, Charles Belgrave, for Nasr bin Jāsim to travel to Bahrain for medical attention.Most of the later correspondence in the volume is dated to the Second World War, and relates to the creation of new or improved RAF facilities in the Gulf in early 1942. These included extended facilities, capable of accommodating bomber squadrons, at Bahrain and Sharjah, and new facilities at Dubai (folio 131). Correspondence also records the arrangements made with the Bahrain hospital and American Missionary hospital in Bahrain, to accommodate RAF patients as required.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000073#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
