Duriiig laat cold weather Mr. Winthrop Hoc kefeller visited Bahrain and tha Petroleuai Concessions Limited's camp in Qa-tar. He io, of couroe, a particularly important person in the American component of Petroleum Concessions Limited. While in Qatar he met Sheikh Abdulla bin Jassim and said he would send him a memento from America. He did not, I gather, state what it vjould be. 2, Some time later I was informed that the promised present was to be an automtic pistol. I acccrdingly instructed the Director of Customs, Bahrain, to intercept it if it arrived and to send it to me at the Agency. I informed the local Manager of the Petroleum Concessions Limited that I had done so. 3, We have had trouble before with Petroleum Concessions making' 'a present of firearms to the Sheikh of Qatar and it was at that timo made very clear to them that the presentation of rilles or pistols to our liheikhs was the sole prerogative of Government. 4, a very handsome pair of automatics has now arrived from Mr. Rockefeller and is In custody. I see no particulai reason why an American subject, even one of the Rockefeller family, should be enabled to trespass on our established prerogative, but before passing final orders I feel that I should refer the matter for your instructions. Ify own view is that Mr. Rockefeller should be informed through Petroleumpetroleum Concessions Limited that a presentation of pistols to the Sheikh of Qatar is contrary to custom and rule and cannot be permitted; the pistols can either be returned to him orj if he so chooses, can be handed over to the Officer the Local . • Coomnding Volunteer Defence Force, who would no doubt be very A happy to receive them.

DO/CT.5/3409 t 15th March, 1943 Dear / Some years ago Mr. Winthrop Rockefeller sent out a very nice pair of .45 automatic pistols for us to pass on as a present to the Shaikh of Qatar. The Hon'hie the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf considered that this type of present was not in order and the last the Company heard of the present was that it was held in safe custody by the Agency pending an opportunity of returning it to the donor. This seemed a difficult matter in war time. In a conversation with Mr. De Grenier yesterday, when the question of disposal of certain arms in his possession cropped up, h6 happensd to MSirtion 'this pair of Mr^Wintlirop Rockefeller and added that under instructions from the Agency he had returned them to the suppliers. I have heard nothing so far from Mr. Winthrop Rockefeller that the weapons have reached America and he has obtained a refund. As he will expect me to watch over his interests in this matter, I shall be grateful for any information you may have regarding the safe arrival of the package in America.
