A* At a separate interview the Sultan asked for the ne: vices of a geologist to carry out. a survey of Dliofnr to ascertai what minerals are present other tlian oil. The Sultan made a similar request in 1943 and the Government of India agreed to said a survey party vide their Express Letter ho. 5402-?l/43 dated 9th August 1943 but on being informed that certain specimais sent for analysis were of no value he asked that the survey should be postponed. :. If the .C.L. c rry out a detailed survey of Dhof r they or bound under their agreement (vide Article 22) to inforru the C^itan G f the presence of any minerals oth r than oil which they happei to discover.

C m I sh uld like therefore to be in a position to inform the Sultan that tiie P.C.L. will, if conditions per.,at, carry out a detailed survey of Dhofar not later than the cold weather of 1947-48 and that they will in the course of it prepare for the Sultan a detailed report of the geological structure of the Province including mention of any valuable minerals discovered, and wo .ld request that if there is no objection the Head Office of the Coup.ny in Lo ;don may be a qTroachsd accordingly. 7 .

We have taken up here the suggestion that Petroleum Concessions Ltd. might under-take geological work in Muscat in the winter of 1945/46, and have discussed the matter with Mr, Wheatley of that Company. It appears that they had already been planning geophysical surveys for next winter and were about to submit proposals to the U. S.A. Petroleum Administrator for War in order to obtain the necessary staff and equipment from the U. S.A., since these are apparently unobtainable in this country at the moment. They have already secured Treasury sanction to the dollar expenditure involved. Mr. Wheatley told us that P.C.L. have in mind another expedition to the Barain’s oasis and the Jebel Paiyah - Jebel Hafit area, probably in two parts, (i) a small preliminary geological mapping party, and (2) a larger geophysical survey party to follow on, the latter to include a number of American geophysical experts since at present apparently there are no British ones. P. C.L^ plans are, however, not yet finally worked out and they have promised to let us have something more definite in writing about the middle of March. In any case everything depends on the approval of the American P.A.W. I an, therefore, writing to you now merely to let you Know in a preliminary way what is in the air. Wheatley mentioned to us also the possibility that he might arrange for the Company's man Williamson to pay you a visit at Bushire before long in order to talk the matter over with you. It seems that there is a likelihood of Williamson being in. charge of the geological napping party if the plans mature. How the Company are to tackle the problem of getting into the Barainian area and of being allowed to stay there for a sufficient length of time when they are there, is a question that will need a good deal of thought. I am sending a copy of this letter to Caroe, Galloway and the Political Agent, Bahrein. Yours sincerely. CSgd.) R.

' ' l ’ 'ho j 2. I conveyed the substance of India Office letter 3269/44 of the 28th July. 1944, to His Highness who, in reply, . 9- cl that he quite understood that developement might be difficult, 7 and had no complaint on that score. His point was that the terms generally, and no especially rates, of the Muscat and Dhofar Concess ions did not compare favourably with terms given in Iraq. What actual concession he was thinking about I did not enquire. 3. In answer to His Highness* belief that Petroleuir Concessions had not given him a fair deal, I told him of the vast v - difference between the two fields on the lines of your demi-official^ letter No. C/128 of the 9th August. 1944. and added more besides. The Sultan was much amuseB~at term' n wild cat*’. Finally I told him that, in my opinion, his criticism could not really be sound as it is not based on knowledge obtained from a geological survey or visual evidence of oil. I think it is fair to say that the Sultan, now feels less strongly against Petroleum Concessions, but a rankling feeling probably remains. 4. It is most undesirable that His Highness should a British Oil Company has taken advantage of him in the feel that _ _ ^ _ matter of these concession^, and the only way to dispel this suspicion is for the Company to prove him wrong. I do not think words will ever do this satisfactorily, and so the obvious method of geological survey remains. Such work could not, of course, be undertaken at once, but the situation will probably have changed sufficiently by next winter to make the launching of a campaign possible. Perhaps therefore, you would consider suggesting the undertaking of geological work in Muscat in the winter of 1945-46. Yours sincerely, Sd/- A.C. Galloway.

No. C/1126. Subj ec ti My dear Metcalfe, Now that I have arrived in Muscat I would like to explain more fully the Sultan* s annoyance at the Company’s action in taking up both these concessions. 2. His Highness i* well aware that sub sidiaries of J^ifelo Iranian Oil Company have oil concessions covering most of the Arabian Coast, and told me that he had seen a map on which all their coneessions were marxed in red. He feels that their object in acquiring these concessions is designed more to exclude other interests than to exploit and develop these areas themselves. I see from the correspondence on the file that His Highness is not alone in this i rapression. 3. The Sultan is restricted under Articles 21 of both Concessions to terminating them only if the Company defaults in payment or in respect of an arbitration award. Convinced as he is, therefore, that the Conqpany are not seriously concerned with developing their concessions, he feels he made a great mistake in conceding tni s Article, especially as he since had the opportunity of studying the Iraq Concession under which the Government of Iraq can terminate the agreement for a variety of reasons e.g. if the Company do not (a) under a survey of at least three areas within eight months of signa ture of the agreement, (b) produce oil within 7l years of the date of the agreement and, except within the first year of production produce a minimum of one million tons per annum. ( These details may be slightly inaccurate because I have seen the Arabic version of the agreement only.) He naturally IxBk regrets that he did not include similar penal clauses in his own concessions, and now feels he is unable to compel the Comapny to develop them in any way at all. ^4 j Q Political Agency,/Muscat. ' The 7 th July 1944. i ^ I 944 ' Oil Concessions for Muscat and Dhofar.4. 1 Again, His Highness knows inanci al terms of the Iraq Concession are more generous, e.g. (a) Payments are made in pounds or shillings compared with Rs. 84,000. (c) Rent for land is paid. No matter how good the terms, the Sultan would probably still feel that he might possibly have improved on them. I am absolutely certain that the Comapny would have had no chance whatsoever in persuading His Highness to agree to a further extension of the Option period, as he would have stood to lose financially by such an extension and would still have had no guarantee that the Company would not take up the Concession whether oil was found or not. His Highness had intenced, I know, talking to Sir Geoffrey Prior about tnis matter during his intended visit to Salal&amp;h with particular reference to paragraphs(2) 'h^d (3) above. 1 did, of course, point out to him that the Company’s activities had, of necessity, been curtailed by the War, but he remains unconvinced of their desire or intention to develop the concession. 7. I am sending a copy of this letter to Sir Geoffrey Prior. Yours sincerely, (sd) R.E.R.Bird. Captain R.D. Me tcalf e, Political Agent, Muscat, Camp Karachi.D.O, jAq.G/1 23• Office of the Toll ti cal Resident in the Persian Gulf, CaiiiiJ, Shiraz, 9th August 1944, Dear Metcalfe, I aee that inBird f 3 letter No. C/ll2b dated the 7th July 1944, paragraph .5(a) the Sultan is mentioned as having compared his concession with that of Iraq ( presumably the latest ). It woula be relevant to mention, if the Sultan gives an opportunity that whereas Iraq was a proven field of immense value when the concession was granted Muscat is still what is technically known as a 'wild cat proposition' i.e. no oil has yet been found, nor, so i ar as I am aware, have any of the usual indications ( oil seepages, bitumen* asphalt or natural gas been found anywhere. Yours sincerely, ( s( ) 0 . G.I rior. Capt, R.D,Metealf e, Political Agent, Mu o ca t.&gt;^w Doar Pool, Many thanks for your letter of August lifth. The enquiry hy the Potroleur.i Administrator for War relates solely to war requirenents. It night he thought that the tine is now approaching when oil projects should he supported, or the reverse, on the basis of whether or not they are in the general interest, without special reference to the war effort. Unfortunately, however, it is still impossible to get priorities for equipment, etc. in the U.S.A. without pleading sane war necessity. Moreover, P.^.W. themselves have only a wartine mandate, and cannot therefore request our views on post-war developments. As regards the supply of oil equipment, materials, etc. after the war, we have already done a good deal of research in this Department, and have came to the conclusion that about 30/£ of our oil equipment requirements over the next 5 years could bo manufactured in tills country, provided wo arc given an adequate allocation of man power, raw materials and manufacturing capacity. Wo are in correspondence with the Treasury and the Ministry of Production on this subject, but the statistics are rather voluminous and this general indication may be enough for your purpose. As regards the balance of 2Dyo which we should need to obtain from the United States, we'do not expect any trouble in obtaining it, provided the Treasury are prepared to release the necessary dollars. It is, however, difficult at present to prophesy the course of events until the new International Oil Commission has begun to operate. I am sending a copy of this letter to Y/ikoly.

There arc one or two points in this connection on which we should bo glad to have your observations. It is not quite clear to.us whether the increase in world refining capacity regarding Which the Potrolcm Administrator for Y/ar has asked for your views, is concerned solely with war requirements or how far it is also related'to post-war development for peacetime needs. YYhat we arc of course interested in from the political point of view is that when the war ends the oil companies holding concessions in the undeveloped Arab states should not find themselves unable to proceed with operations for lack of equipment, for which I understand we arc so largely dependent on America. In the case of Muscat, the Political Resident informed us recently that according to the Political Agent at Muscat who has been in almost daily contact with the Sultan, the latter is very keen on oil development, but is not convinced that the company intend to exploit their concession. We should be very grateful for your caments on the above points and for any information that you can give us as to tho latest plans of the Petroleum Division regarding the supply of oil equipment after the war.

Dear Prior, |944 The Petroleum Division have drawn our attention to paragraph 3 of Unseat telegram No. C/1075 regarding Petroleum Concessions Ltd^ Muscat oil concession. They point out that the delay in /q 1 developing this concession is due to the fact that at the beginning of the war placed a ban on developments which were unlikely to contribute directly to the war effort in order to conserve dollar exchange and critical materials. In these circumstances the Company cannot justly be accused^at least in so far as the period of the war is concernedjof causing undue delay. F. A. K.

As you are no doubt aware, the delay in developing this concession is due to the fact that at the beginning of the war H.M* Government placed a ban on developments wM.ch were unlikely to contribute directly to the war effort, in order to conserve dollar exchange and critical materials. In these circumstances the Company cannot justly be accused of causing undue delay and I think it might be useful if the political Resident’s attention could be drawn to this point, since implications of this kind may lead to serious misunderstandings.

I said 1932 Iraq concession was made as far as I know with certain knowledge of presence of oil which was not the case here but he still considers he has made a bad bargain and avowedly blames his own ignorance.

It appears to us to be highly probable that the Sultan would welcome any such negotiations which would present him with the opportunity to re-open other provisions of the Agreements which he feels are unfavourable to him. Rather than run any such risk of becoming involved in such negotiations under present international oil conditions, we feel it would be best to taxe up the Concession and pay up the sum of Rs. 1,30,000 involved.

TRANSLATION WITH REFERENCE TO YOUR TELEGRA'i NO. 960, I UNDERSTAND rHAT THE SULTAN AT A RECENT INTERVIEW WITH THE POLITICAL AGENT OR RESIDENT EXPRESSED THE OPINION THAT HE COULD OBTAIN MORE ADVANTAGEOUS TERMS FROM OTHER INTERESTS IF WE RELINQUISHED OUR CONCESSIONS. IT SEEMS MOST IMPROBABLE THAT THE SULTAN HOLDING SUCH BELIEFS WOULD AGREE TO THE EXTENSION OF 'THE OPTION PERIOD ON EXISTING TERMS AND IT IS HIGHLY PROBABLE THAT HE MIGHT ATTEMPT TO OBTAIN AN ADJUSTMENT OF OTHER TERMS OF THE CONCESSION TO MEET HIS NEW IDEAS. IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, I PREFER TO DROP ANY IDEA OF AN EXTENSION OF THE OPTION PERIOD AND TO TAKE UP CONCESSIONS FOR BOTH MUSCAT OMAN AND DHOFAR BY ADVISING THE SULTAN OF OUR DESIRE SO TO DO AS PROVIDED IN ARTICLES 6 OF THE RESPECTIVE AGREEMENTS. PLEASE ACT ACCORDINGLY. IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES IT IS PREFERABLE THAT LERJ1ITTE SHOULD NOT VISIT THE SULTAN IF THE POLITICAL RESIDENT WILL BE GOOD ENOUGH TO ARRANGE FOR THE DELIVERY OF THE NECESSARY LETTERS BOTH TO THE SULTAN PERSONALLY AND TO HIS GOVERNMENT AT IUSCAT.

I note that you have omitted any reference to the termination of hostilities with Japan from the formula governing the date of commencement of the extension of five years. On further consideration, I agree that such an omission is of no practical importance, as the Company is adequately covered by the proviso regarding the engagement of men, etc. if the war with Japan should continue after that with Germany and prevent resumption of exploration work. The revised drafts are, therefore, acceptable to us. I suggest, in order to save time, that if the Political Resident has no comments to make on the drafts, he should pass copies to our Bahrein Management, who can then carry on with the negotiations. I shall be glad to hear whether this procedure can be adopted in order that the necessary instructions can be cabled to our Bahrein Management. Yours sincerely. R. T.

So long as the U.S.A. is at war with Japan there is likely to be difficulty in obtaining supplies of American plant and equipment for oil exploration in the areas under discussion.

Muscat &amp; Oman (excluding Dhofar and Qv/adur). j t Concession dated 24th June 193?• The concession to run for 75 v y©ars commencing with a 5 year option period during which Company may terminate the agreement or take up the concession finally.’ Payments - (1) during option period Rs.50C0 per month plus initial payment of Rs.100,000. (2) When concession is taken over finally - f (a) Rs. 100,000 on signature; (b) for first five years Rs .84,000 per annum or royalty of Rs. 3 per ton, whichever is the greater; ? , JfcA (c) for 6th and subsequent years Rs»96,OOC per annum;^^ ' * (d) additional payment of 4 annas per ton of substances won. If, on expiry of the option period the Company require an extension, the Sultah will grant an extension for 2 years on same terms subject to initial payment of Rs.lO,OOC. t If, through force majeure, fulfilment by the Company of any conditions be'delayed, the period of delay will be added to the periods fixed by the agreement. ‘ * Dhofar . &lt; Agreement dated 24th June 1937* Terms are similar to the Muscat and ‘Dnan agreement with the following ’ exceptions Initial payment will be Rs.30,0CC. During the option period payment of Rs.3,000 per month. On taking up the concession payment of Rs.3O,O0C on signature. For 1st five years Rs.43,000 or Rs«3 royalty.

The Political Resident's proposal as^xhat in the case of Muscat and Oman and Dhofar, an agreement‘should be negotiated with the SheiMi for an extension of the option period from 24th June 194^ to 24th June 194^, and in the case of Ajman the whole agreement should be extended frcm 25rd March 1944 to 25rd March, 1949* He suggests that a provision should be inserted to provide for the'further extension of the agreements to allow the Company to carry on exploration for a clear five years after the war with Germany is ended. This proposal should ^ have the effect of ensuring the Company's rights and at the same time 7 saving them money, since if the agreement^ were finally taken up their payments to the Rulerfc would be at a higher rate than under the terms of an exploratory arrangement. There do not seem to be any disadvantages attached and the Political Resident's proposals are, one imagines, likely to be voty acceptable to the Canpany. As regards the Company's alternative proposal in the case of Ajman, it might be mentioned here that the Sharjah agreement is for 75 years ^ ^ and is roughly on the same lines* as the Muscat agreement 5 , except for ^ ' 0 l the, figures of payment, which are as follows:- ' On signature Rs.6o,OCO. On discovery of oil in commercial quantities Rs.200,000. Until the discovery of oil in commercial quantities, Rs.30,OCO per annum. In the event of production in less than commercial quantities, Rs. 50,000 per annum or royalty of Rs.3, whichever is greater. After discovery of oil in commercial quantities, Rs*90,000 per annum or royalty of Rs.3. In addition, payments of 4 annas per ton of all substances produced. The reference to drilling in Schedule I is to the effect that drilling will begin within 9 years of signature and that if the Company have not done geological and field work with every diligence within this period, the agreement will be annulled. ¥. r e might consult the Petroleum Division before replying to the Political Resident's telegram, and a draft letter is suggested accordingly.DRAFT LETTER.

There is no necessity to call for a repetition as the meaning is clear enough for present purposes. The first portion, regarding an agreement between H.M.G. and the Ruler, obviously refers to Qatar and presumably we shall hear from you in due course on this matter. The remainder of the telegram refers to instructions sent by us to Packer regarding our Agr eements with the Shaixh of Ajman and the Sultan of Oman and Dhofar. The Ajman Agreement, which gives us survey and exploration rights only, expires in March, 1944 and we instructed Packer to endeavour to obtain an extension of the existing Agreement for a period expiring five years after the conclusion of an Armistice between Great Britain and Germany and Japan, whichever shall be the later, on the grounds that our operations have been interrupted by reasons beyond our control. If, however, the Political Resident does not lavour such an approach, we gave Packer instructions as to the terms whicn he was authorized to offer the Shaikh for a 75 year Concession in exercise of our right under Article 3 of the existing Agreement. Either of these alternative settlements are acceptable to us but we considered that the first alternative might be preferred by the Political Resident who might not wish to have negotiations for an Oil Concession opened at the present time in the Persian Gulf area. / 5 A t As regards Oman and Dhofar, we are prepared to accept either an extension of the ’option’ period or to take up the Concession .in accordance with its terms. Here again, we feel that the ‘'“'interruption of our operations by the war might be considered by : ■ ....the Sultan as adequate reason and justification for the extension of the 'option’ period. I will keep you informed of any further developments which may be reported by Packer. Yours sincerely. T.A.K. Harrison, Esq., India Office, Whitehall, S.W. 1.p??

K We have recently received an enquiry on 'behalf of a f^roup representing British and American interests in regard to Gwadur. P.C.L. are not interested in this area. In 1923 (see page 319 Vol.XI Aitchison's Treaties) the then Sultan of Muscat gave an undertaking that he would not exploit any petroleum which may be found anywhere within his territories and would not grant permission for its exploitation without consulting the Political Agent at Muscat and without the approval of the High Government of India. 2. It was decided at P.Z.1254/36 (Flag A in Coll.30/ 110(2)) to allow Petroleum Concessions Ltd. to open negotiations with the Sultan on the understanding that any concession will be subject to H.M.G.’s approval and would be accompanied by the usual 'political” agreement between the Company and H.M.G. 3. After some delay (due mainly to the absence of the Sultan from his capital) the Company was successful in obtaining two concessions from the Sultan, one in respect of the Province of Dhofar and the other in regard to the whole of Muscat territories excluding Dhofar and the x oversea enclave of Gwadur. Copies of the two concessions will be found immediately below. The concessions are modelled on the common form which has been adopted by the Company for Arabia oil concessions and do not differ in any material respect which affects Government from the draft Muscat concession originally submitted by the Company in March 1936, when they secured H.M.G.’s approval to the opening of negotiations. 4. The concessions have actually been signed without any concurrent reservation in writing to the effect that they are subject to the approval of H.M.G., but it is understood that the Sultan was informed orally of the necessity for a political agreement between H.M.G. andthe Company and an Exchange of Notes between the Sultan and the Company. Ttic Gru^a*^ ilu^axi^y tj- &amp;&gt;**** cuv&amp;u. ^ilc^tua^fU^ , o. The terms of the proposed political agreement opyyjj) have been accepted by the Company, and with the concurrence of the foreign Office it is now proposed on the recommendation of Sir Trenchard Fowle to postpone signature until the Sultan’s concurrence in the drafts and in the proposed Exchange of Notes has been obtained. *('T' 2 - 7° A.

Petroleum Concessions Limited are a British Company and if the ex-territorial rights granted to British subjects by the Muscat Treaty of 1891 give total exemption from taxes except those definitely mentioned in the 1‘reaty ( a question on which I am addressing you separately), then this tax would be in contravention of the Treaty.

'The sultan may apply to the Company to send the person concerned - if a foreigner - out of the Sultanate'* Tne Company can of course dismiss any foreign employee. If this foreign employee is a non- British subject the sultan can deport him, but if a British subject then he falls under the jurisdiction of the political Agent, anS^the Company will nave to apply to the Political Agent for deportation of the individual complained of. such an application would rarely be necessary since once an individual had been dismissed and paid off by the company he would nardly choose to stay on in Muscat as a gentleman at large. 1 do not think /4* I nave made no comments on tne financial terms but tne Sultan would appear to nave made a good bargain* 1 nave already commented on the commendable celerity with which the concession was obtained tvide paragraph 1 of my telegram quoted above) and it may be that tne activity of the Company and their representa tive in Muscat, in contrast to their dilatory methods on the Trucial Coast, was partly due to tne stimulas applied to them referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3 of your telegram ho* 1541 of the 1st June 1937* ad* T.C*Fowle.

Item (4) suggests the question of the Sultan’s responsibility lor the safety of the employees of tne Company when working in his territories, I refer to txiis point in another part of ay letter. Items (10) and ftl). The words deleted were objected to by the huit&amp;n. Item (Ik)* The words were in the Arabic text but nad been omittea evidently through en oversight from the English version. Item (13), London was objected to by the Sultan as being too far away, 7. The additions and amendments to the articles for incorporation in the Draft of the Concession as mentioned in my paragraph 3 above are given in the attached schedules marked *A W and 'B' respectively, (? The only item wnich calls for comment is No.4 of 'A*. The Sultan declared that now he had got into personal touch with Petroleum Concessions Ltd through their Representative Mr, Lermitte, he did not wish that they should transfer their rights to any other Company, His objection was overcome by adding the words ^direct subsidiary” in front of tae word 'Company” in line 6 of Article £3. i e./8 H«f«r«nce ay remarks In paragraph 6 regarding itme (4), In view of Article 17 of the Concession I presume tnere will not be any objection to the deletion^ of the *'ords in question. I see no mention any where in the Draft Con cession of the Sultan unuertaklng responsibility for the safety of the personnel of tne Company when working in hia territory. As the Draft Concession has I understand been generally approved of by His l&amp;jesty f s Government the Inclu sion of Article 17 is no doubt considered to satisfy the requirements of tills question. I notice tnat it is similar in its wording to Article 15 of the Dubai Oil Concession wnieh has been finally, I tmamxxtxjqp believe, approved of by His Majesty's Government. 9. For your information I would mention that no pay- merit lias yet been made by Mr, Lermitte to tne Sultan. He is awaiting definite instructions on this point from the London Office of nie Company to whom ne nas forwarded by Air i*ail the amendments and additions to the printed Draft Concession required by tne duitan and of which Inave given tne aetails ^ above. Mr. Lermltte hopes to receive these instructions by 3th July. The 3ultan is willing to stay in Karachi until l£th July if necessary. (jd) &lt;?■ |7 Wrfr&lt;5 Political Agent k Consul, Muscat/J / .

I send you herewith, as you request, photostat copies of an advance copy of the two concessions. We had certainly assumed that the Political £gent, Muscat, had given the Sultan some idea of the Political Agreement which would be entered into between you and us, and that the Sultan had appeared not unwilling to be a party to it: under this impression we are making the payments stipulated in the concession agreement. As soon as we hear further from you on the subject of the final text of the Political Agreement, and agree this, there is, I hope, no reason why things should not take their normal course, ending in the formal consent of H.M.G. to the two concessions.

(b). Article 17 . The words M under the conditions specified in Article 12 hereof** has been omitted. The retention of the reference to Article 12 would have been preferable but as that is the only Article in the concession relating to declaration of safety there is no risk of ambiguity. I there fore do not think that the omission matters, and suggest that it should be concurred in. (c). Art icle 23.

Whole conduct ®f Dib&amp;i negotiations on the part of the Company and Holmes have been unsatisfactory and fch&amp;t Sheikh has signed concession is due as much to his personal promise to me ae to any efforts on the part of the Company*, Holmes has been most dilatory and 1 have good evidence that Haji Williamson, also employed by the Company on the tracial coast^ has been intriguing on behalf of the Cal^f^t'maw*Ar£via Standard Oil against the Sheikh of Dibai, who has asked that he should not be allowed back in Dib&amp;i territory* 7 0 Five other Truoial Coast Sheikha have still to grant concessions, particularly Shargah and Ras~al~ Khaimah, whose options expire respectively on September £Gth s and August 1st* Holmes has informed the Political Agent th&amp;t he will now approach Sheikha of ftaa-al-Khaimah and Shargah* but Political Agent understands agreements for these Sheikhs are not yet finally drafted*, if this ie so, 1 cannot understand Company^ and/or Holmes^ inefficiency %n not having these ready, especially as Holmes gave me to understand that^ directly3 directly Dibai conceesiora wae signed, he was prepared to negotiate with other SheikhBc In the meantime, I am urging Holmes, through Political Agent, to approach these Sheikho immediately an the lines of Dib&amp;i concession* 8 C Holmes has told Political Agent that he is asking the Company to relieve him as soon as possible as he is unwell c 9 C I venture to suggest that Company’s headquarters in London be approached on the following lines: (a) unsatisfactory nature of their conduct of negotiations up to date should be impressed on them with a viev/ to their displaying more activity in future; (b) that they should telegraph immediately to Holmes giving terms of Sh&amp;rgah and Bas^alnOiaimah concessions and directing him to pursue negotiations with these Sheikhs forthwith; (c) it is obvious that Holmes cannot* with his Trueial Coast preoccupations, proceed to Muscat and that another representative should be sent there immediately c (in this connection eee your express letter P C Z.. 3099. 11th May) c i suggest Muscat, My lies., who is a first-rate man and who got Qatar concession^ 10 c What It comes to is that unless Company bestir themselves there is a distinct danger of the remaining Trucial Coast Shaiikhdoms and of Muscat being captured by the California Arabia Standard Oil Co c or by American-Italian interests, vide my express letter C-lO?, lat May cTelephone - Mansion House 7775 Telegrams:- Yellas,Stock,London Ballantyne &amp; Company H R Ballantyne.

He assured me that they were being active in the matter in so far as circumstances (e.g. Holmes The Hon*ble Lieut.-Col. T.C.*v. Fowls, C.B.E., ’a Consulate General, Bushire. beingbeing rather held up on the Trucial Coast) permitted. In view of the fact that (so far as I car. gather from B&amp;llantyne) the Standard Oil Company’s analysis of the sample sent to them has been negative, zhe situation in regard to the possibility of Standard Oil competition may be eased. Your* sinoerdlf* (Sgd.) M. J. CLAUSONConfidential. D•O.NQ.211-S* 1 693 I937 j The Residency, Bushire, the 15th February 1937. Could you please refer to correspondence ending with my telegram No.212 of to-day on the subject of Muscat Oil. 2. The following is an extract of some interest from a letter from Watts dated the 8th February 1937 with reference to his conversation with the Sultan on his last visit to Dhofar • M The Sultan then said that he wished a separate oil concession to be made for Dhofar quite independently from any other concession which might be made for the remainder of his territories. I replied that in my opinion such an arrangement would be far from acceptable to any Company wishing to exploit for oil as it would be certain to lead to many difficulties and complications. 'The Sultan’s idea behind this plan, is I think fairly clear. He has always looked upon Dhofar Province as his own personal property and not part of Muscat State in the usual sense. A separate concession for this province would, I think he imagines, enable him to put into his own pocket the whole of whatever sum would be given for the concession together with ary royalties etc. A concession for the whole of Muscat State (excluding of course Oman) would, the Sultan knows, require guarantees of security for the personnel of the oil Compary. Effective arrangements for this purpose would he is well aware mean comparatively heavy expenditure in the form of presents to the local chieftains over practically the whole of the laMAKia® f State, excepting Dhofar Province, and especially in the Sur fNOJA QFFJi neighbourhood where the notorious Beni Bu Ali tribe have small / M.J.Clauson Esquire, The India Office, London.n small respect for the Sultan’s authority vide paragraph 3 of my Express Letter Z|/49 dated October 11th 1936* ' It is possible that the Sultan’s anxiety to fix up some separate arrangement for Dhofar may have been the motive which caused him to endeavour to short circuit us and approach the Standard Oil Company direct'. 3. The Sultan also informed Watts that he had found traces of oil on the surface of the ground in the vicinity of Murbat and later, on Y/atts’ return to Muscat, sent him a sample, which Watts is keeping pending the arrival of the Petroleum Concessions Limited representative. ’ i am sending copies of this letter to Metcalfe and If at t s. -r-.c- * sent under Printed letter !No.212-S of 15th February 1937.P.

I spoke to Mr. Ballantyne to-day and made to him, on hehalf of His Majesty*s Government, a statement in the terms contained in paragraph 2 of India Office telegram of the 10th February to Bushire, No. 481. Mr. Ballantyne noted this statement. . He said that obviously the Company’s first reaction v/ould be to ask, with reference to the last sentence of the statement, when the Company would be allowed to enter the field. He recognised, however, that it was impossible for His Majesty’s Government to give any answer at this stage to such a question, and that, broadly speaking, His Majesty’s Government desired T C,L, the CottTOftfty, which had been in the field for a year and through no fault of its own had been unable to make any substantial progress, to have a fair run for its money before any other Company was admitted. He said that he might have to raise the matter again at a later date, but for the present he thought the Company would be quite satisfied with the statement. Incidentally I gathered from Mr. Ballantyne that the Company’s analysis of the samples sent to them by the Sultan of Muscat has been negative, so that they may not in any case be very interested in a Muscat concession. Mr. Ballantyne said that he presumed that His Majesty’s Government would not see any objection to the Company sending to the Sultan the analysis for which he had asked them.

'yj Mr.Eallantyne called urgently on January 26th to say that the Company (Standard Oil) had received from the Sultan of Muscat samples of oil seepages in Muscat for their consideration. The samples were sent to Bahrein and from there to Hasa for examination by the Calarabian people. Mr.Ballantyne emphasises that so far as he was aware the initiative in this case had come from the Sultan. ihe Company, before taking any decision as to the line which they would take as a result of being given this opening by the Sultan, felt that they had better report the matter to H.M.G. and ask whether H.M.G. had any views it express. l said teat so iar as I knew this was the first we had heard of the Sultan’s action. I could not say wha,t u. M. G. ’ s views would be but promised him an early answer. I added that we had had some correspondence both with Petroleum Concessions Limited and with the Sultan about an oil concession for the former but I did not remember ofthand how deeply we were committed to that Company in respect of this area. Mr.Ballantyne telephoned on the 27th to ask if he could have an answer. I told him that I had submitted the matter for instructions here and that it was desired to consult the various authorities concerned before giving the Company H.M.G. ’s considered views, &gt;t ^He said the Company were in rather a hurry and probably feared the possibility of others getting in ahead of them.

Mr-ballantyne hinted that the Company might have desired to send i: r. Ham i 11 on (who is at present in Bahrein) round to Muscat to see the Sultan, or alternatively to wait there until permission was received from His Majesty’s Government for him to see the Sultan. Would H.M.G. be likely to object to that, if e.g. Mr.Hamilton applied for a visa ? I said I thought it would probably be premature to consider such a trip. The first step in any case would probably have to be taken through the Political Agent and not by direct contact between the Company and the Sultan. *'ut I had no authority to give him an answer to this hypothetical question. If Mr.Hamilton applied for a visa locally the authorities would no doubt refer the matter and that question could be settled in conjunction with the larger question. I suggested that it might be wise for the Company to wait for H.LT.C.’s views, as they had asked for them, before doing s.ny more. That, however, was for the Company to decid There was of course no guarantee that H.M.G.’ s reply, when made, would be satisfactory from the Company’s point of view Mr.Ballantyne said he quite understood the position.

Reference ray telegram No.3/44 dated 8th October. For your information I give herewith a resume of the Sultan*s reactions to the information I gave him at Dhofar in April regarding the proposed negotiations for oil which Petroleum Concessions Ltd. desire to carry out with him. 2. The Sultan declared at once that he was quite willing to start negotiations with the Company on his return to Muscat which he said would probably be in October. (However recent information received points to it being doubtful if he will be back before December). I pointed out that the concession would probably be s 0 drav?n as to cover the whole of the State including Oman. The Sultan replied that of course Oman was for such purposes entirely out of his control but that for the rest of his territory he could, he felt confident, make all necessary arrangements for exploitation and for the safety of personnel of the Oil Company. I specially asked His Highness whether he thought the Bani 3u Ali would be likely to cause trouble in the Sur district. The Sultan declared with feeling and bitterness that the Bani Bu Ali were the greediest and most grasping tribe in the whole of his State and though they could, he said, most probably be induced to keep quiet and refrain from interference with prospecting parties and any operations which might be carried out subsequently in their territory, they would have to be heavily bribed.A - 2 - 3. The Sultan became emotional when talking about the Bani Bu Ali and their (in his opinion) mercenary disposition. He considers and I think no doubt quite rightly that whatever sum he may receive from Petroleum Concessions Ltd, for the right to prospect and exploit oil in his dominions, a substantial portion would have to be given to this notorious tribe if the concession is to include their territory. 4. That the Sultan said as regards the Oman is of course correct. In my opinion the Imam would never come to an agree ment with the Sultan to allow any foreign Company to prospect for oil within his boundaries. I think that he might be willing to negotiate for such a purpose through British Official channels so long as the Muscat Government were left outside. To such action there would no doubt be objections as it would probably lead to complications. - POLITICAL■■■mi TELEPHONE : NATIONAL 3582 TELEGRAMS : INLAND : PETCONCESS, FINSQUARE, LONDON FOREIGN : PETCONCESS, LONDON A rr 3 ^ Q1 3 ( \ X s i n r r CODES : BENTLEY’S SECOND PHRASE BENTLEY'S COMPLETE PHRASE WITH OIL SUPPLEMENT LOMBARD J 6 o J PETROLEUM CONCESSIONS LIMITED DIRECTORS : Sir John Cadman, G.C.M.G.

Sheikh should be informed that Petroleum Concessions Limited, having asked His Majesty's Government for permission to approach His Excellency with a view to negotiating for the unallotted area on basis of draft concession submitted, have been informed that His Majesty's Government have no objection to their doing so. Presumably Holmes will be required to approach Sheikh through Political ,\gent in the first instance, but having done so might conduct detailed negotiations direct while keeping Political Agent informed of their progress. 4. Muscat * There is no objection to Company approaching the Sultan. 5. Trucial Sheikhdoms, '''hen question of options has been disposed of (see my telegram No. 832, dated 7th March) there is no objection to Holmes opening negotiations with Sheikhs whom he would invite to Bahrein for the purpose. He should make his first approach to them through the Political Agent, who should be kept in close touch with the progress of the negotiations. The following/2 . following preliminary conclusions have been reached at this stage on questions of (1) Boundaries, (2) Protection. As regards (l), it will he sufficient at this stage to define areas of concessions as those of the respective Sheikhdoms without annexing maps, hut eventually it will he desirable to define boundaries so far as possible, and His Majesty's Government accordingly suggest that Resident should take steps as soon as possible to enquire into boundaries of various Sheikhdoms inter se and vis-a-vis Muscat. Question of boundary between Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia would depend on course of negotiations with Ibn Saud. as regards (2) His Majesty's Government are inclined to view that so far as possible all responsibility for protection should be placed by the concession agreement on Sheikhs themselves (compare Article 15 of draft concessions and condition (c) attached to approval of the options), but provision could also be made in political agreements and in accompanying exchange of letters between Government and Sheikhs concerned that any movements of Company's employees entailing special risks (e.g. penetration for more than a certain distance into the hinterland) should be subject to prior written permission of Sheikh who would thusbe responsible for saying where Company could operate and consequently (in the event of any incident occurring) for taking all possible action against the culprits and ikying any compensation which His Majesty’s Government might consider necessary. 6. ms regards Bahrein, Trucial Sheikhdoms and Muscat, we should emphasise both to Holmes and the rulers concerned in informing them of permission to start negotiations that no concession can be finally concluded without specific further approval of His Majesty's Government, who would require Company to enter into separate/r\ 3. separate political agreement with them. 7. Please see separate telegram regarding Koweit Neutral Zone. 8. I should he glad of your and Resident’s concurrence or observations in above proposals. Draft concessions would be examined here from legal point of view and corresponding political agreements would be drafted. As regards general form of concessions His Majesty’s Government are satisfied that it is in accordance with usual procedure of oil companies nowadays to combine exploration and development in one concession agreement.P.Z.1240/36, CODE TELEGRAM PROM SECRETARY OP STATE FOR INDIA, ADDRESSED TO POLITICAL RESIDENT, BU3HIRE: REPEATED TO POLITICAL AGENTS, K07EIT AND BAHREIN, DATED 28th FEBRUARY 1936.

I would suggest that we should now have an informal / meeting of representatives of the interested departments (Foreign Office, Petroleum Department, Admiralty, and Air Ministry) to consider the situation. The following appear to be the main points for discussion. 3* Bahrein and kuscat . Can the Company be allowed to authorise Holmes to start negotiations at Bahrein on the basis of the draft concession, and to approach the Sultan of Muscat, where if business resulted the ultimate E.A.Seal, Esq., Admiralty, S.W.l.negotiations would follow the lines of the Trucial Coast drafts? Such permission would he given on the understanding that there will have to he concurrent Agreements between the Company and His majesty’s Government. 4. Trucial Coast . On the question of procedure in regard to the approval of the options already obtained by the D’Arcy Exploration Company ( alias Anglo-Persian Oil Company) I have consulted Fowle. That is a comparatively unimportant matter. The main question is whether we can now allow the Company to authorise Holmes to enter into negotiations with the various Sheikhs (who would visit Bahrein for the purpose) on the basis of the draft Concessions, subject, of course, to the concurrent negotiation of satisfactory agreements between the Company and His Majesty’s Government. It wi11 be noted that the Company, propose to apply for concessions straight away without waiting to do any exploratory work under the existing options. Skliros and Lefroy called here on 6th February and eixplained that their reasons for this are not any desire to rush us,’ but that their arrangements with Holmes make it desirable to get the whole tiling settled as soon as possible; and apart from this they wish to3 enter at onoo into firm agreements with the Sheikhs (from which of course the latter would benefit financially), because the price of the concessions might be unduly enhanced in the event (improbable though they think it) of oil having actually been found in one or more of the territories concerned before the concessions are obtained. 5. With a view to deciding whether permission can be given to commencement of the Trucial Coast negotiations, we may have to consider in a preliminary way at this stage certain points which will be fully dealt with at greater leisure, in consultation with the interested departments, when we prepare the Government agreements that will have to accompany the concession agreements, vis ., (l) the question of boundaries - on this, as you will see from my letter of 7th February to Fowle, Skliros is quite ready to be accommodating, (2) the connected question of protection. As regards the latter point, Article 15 of the draft concessions puts certain responsibility on the Sheikh (which seems right, so far at any rate, as it goes). 6 . The question of a refinery will of course be dealt v/’ith in the Government agreement. 7 . Koweit Neutral Zone . This question presents difficulties. Hitherto we have envisaged no more thanan attempt 'by the Company to obtain an option from the Sheilda Now they want to commit the Sheikh to certain specific terms as the 'basis of any joint concession which might eventually 'be granted. Skliros states his position in his letter of February 6th. The question is whether v/e need object. 8. If you agree that we should meet and discuss these questions? I would suggest Friday, 21st February? at 3*30 p.m. in the India Office. 9* I am sending similar letters to Rendel, Courtney and StarlingIELIa OFU'ICE LONDON, S.W.l P.Z.946/1936 Air Mail. 7th February, 1936. -'TV'Uj With reference to my letter of 31st January, P.Z.677/36, and previous correspondence regarding the proposals of Petroleum Concessions Limited, I enclose copy, Dated 30th January. with six enclosures, of the Company’s reply to our official letter of 12th December.

Ne shall of course be consulting you further, after obtaining the preliminary views of the other Departments of His Majesty’s Government, regarding the various draft concessions enclosed with the letter of 30th January from Petroleum Concessions Limited. 3. The point on which 1 want to consult you at the moment is the procedure in regard to the approval of the options already obtained by the Anglo Iranian Oil Company from the Sheikhs of the Trucial Coast. The original proposal/ ; Lieutenant Colonel /.Fowle, C.B.E., BUSHIRE.proposal od: Petroleojn Concessions Limited in their letter of P4th October was that they should take transfer of these options from the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, and we have signified that we would approve the grant of the options and their transfer on the conditions set out in paragraph 5 of our letter to Petroleum Concessions Limited of 12th December. The two Companies now propose a somewhat different procedure - viz ., that the options should not be transferred, because for technical reasons (presumably the wording of the option agreements) they are not transferable, and suggest that the approval of the opening of negotiations for actual concessions might be given at the same time as approval of the options. Skliros and Lefroy called here on 6th February, and 1 explained to them that it may be some little time before approval can be given to the opening of negotiations for actual concessions on the lines of the draft concessions which they have sent us. In accordance with paragraph 5(d) of our letter of 12th December approval has yet to be given to the commencement of negotiations for actual concessions, and though it is probable that we shall be able to give it, the question has yet to be decided in consultation with/3 . other Departments and yourself, and might take time to consider from the point of view of the commitments which would be involved in the grant of concessions. (Two points which might have to be considered are, for example, the southern boundary of the Abu Dhabi concession, and the general principles which we might have to get clear in our own minds in advance in regard to the sort of provisions that should be made for the protection of the concessionaire. I dare say there will be no great difficulty on either point. Skliros suggested at our talk on 6th February that the southern boundary of the concessions might be kept indeterminate and said that he saw no reason why the Company should not agree that any operations to work a concession would be confined within whatever distance of the coast we pleased. But these points have to be considered.) I informed Skliros and Lefroy that we would let them have an official reply to the Company's letter as soon as possible, but that there must be some little delay on account of the necessity of consulting the other authorities concerned. Meanwhile it is probable that Holmes may be able to fill in/ with the a little possible eventual4 . in time by starting work in regard to the Bahrein concession and perhaps visiting Muscat, though he will not make any start at all until we iniorm Petroleum Concessions Limited that he may do so. 4. Now with relerence to the procedure in regard to the existing options; there seem to be two alternatives - (1) to approve the grant of the options to the Anglo-lranian Oil Company at once, on that Company agreeing to conditions (a), (b) and (d) and the Sheikhs concerned agreeing to condition (c); (2) to postpone approval of the options (a course to which the Anglo-lranian Oil Company have no objection) until we are in a position to approve the opening of negotiations for actual concessions; then to approach the Sheikhs in regard to condition (c), to explain to them the proposal that negotiations should be opened by Petroleum Concessions Limited, and then approve at the same time both the options and the opening of these further negotiations. The second alternative seems to have the merit of making one bite at the cherry with regard to the Sheikhs. It will in any case presumably be necessary for someone to/to explain to the Sheikhs how it comes about that, though it was the Anglo-lranian Oil Company which obtained the options, it is Petroleum Concessions Limited which is negotiating ior concessions. It will, of course, primarily be ior the Anglo-lranian Oil Company representatives in the Gulf to do this, and wo understand that they will be instructed to introduce Holmes and give the necessary explanation, but it will perhaps also be desirable that you, when the time comes, should inform the Sheikhs that His Majesty's Government approve the opening of negotiations under the options by Petroleum Concessions Limited through Holmes, and that it will be understood that any concession concluded can only be granted subject to the approval of His Majesty's Government. As, therefore, it will probably be desirabl to approach the Sheikhs at the time when Holmes opens his negotiations, you may think it the simplest and least troublesome course to postpone till then the approach to them in regard to the approval of the options and condition (c). Could you kindly let us know by telegraph which course you think preferable from your point of view?5 . \Ye are assuming, in view of your telegram of 4th December, IIo.995, that you have no objection to the employment of Holmes as tne individual to oe entrusted sy the C om pan y with t he negotiations. 6. Since this was written, Lefroy telephones that his Company are advised by Elkington that they should explain to the Sheikhs forthwith the present position in regard to the options and the proposal which is being made to His hajesty s Government that their affiliated company, Petroleum Concessions Ltd., should negotiate concessions. The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company aru instructing Elxington to act accordingly, subject to your prior approval of the messages to be sent to the Sheikhs. 3- do not thinx that this development greatly affects the choice between the two alternatives suggested above in regard to our own procedure, since when the proposal that P.C.L. should open negotiations for concessions has been approved by His Majesty's Government, it will still no douot be necessary or desirable that you should inform the Sheikhs that this is the case. Yours sincerely. (Sd.) J. C. WALTON.946/1956. P Petroleum Concessions Limited, City-Gate House, PinsLury Square, London, E.C.2* 6th February, 1936. D e ar Mr. Walton, In reply to your letter of the 4th instant, I send herev/ith four more sets of the draft Concessions. 2. I have discussed with Mr. Lelroy the formal transfer of the 'Crucial Coast options, but although the two companies concerned are in entire agreement over P.C.L. negotiating and obtaining the Concessions in its own name, I gather that technically the options themselves are not transferable; Mr. Lefroy has offered to, clear up thic matter with you. 3. The operation of para.5(c) of your letter of the 12th December will not arise for some time; the DMircy will not be sending out anyone, and P.C.L. does not propose to launch an exploratory party of two or three geologists until October next. Mr. holmes has already left, but he does not propose to wander along the frucial Coast; his proposal was to take up residence in Bahrein, where the Company willbe in funds at the Eastern Bank, and with the approval of the Political Resident to request the Rulers of the Prucial Coast to call one at a time, discuss terms, sign, and take away their bags of Rupees. it will be necessary, ox course, for the D’Arcy to notify each Ruler that Mr. holmes is negotiating with its full approval on behalf of P.C.L., and i hope that you can instruct the Political Resident to confirm to each/each Ruler that the candidature of P.O.L., vice the D'Arcy, is acceptable to His Majesty’s Government. It would be most unfortunate if the Rulers, having granted these options to the D’Arcy, should maintain that Concessions can be granted only to the D’Arcy, and not to P.C.L.; as you are aware the D’Arcy is unable to hold these Concessions. 5. I agree that the Koweit Keutral bone presents a distinct problem; recognising that it is impossible to negotiate simultaneously «/ith the Sheikh and with King. Abdul Aziz, I endeavoured to lay down in the draft the terms which would be binding on the Sheikh; similar terms would then be offered to King Abdul Aziz. If they do not reach his minimum, the terms must either be increased until he is satisfied - in which case the Sheikh would receive corresponding benefir - or the idea of obtaining a comprehensive Concession over the Reutral Zone would have to be dropped. In the latter alternative P.C.L. must pay to the Sheikh the whole of the option money that it will have contracted to pay during the five-year option period; it can then either retire from the scene, or it can elect to pay the increased yearly payments that will become applicable after the initial five-year option period, and persevere with King Abdul Aziz. X have accepted ix as an essential preliminary to a successful negotiation of this Concession, having regard to the oil rights being under co-interested ownership, to bind one of the parties to certain definite terms, otherwise a negotiator appealing in turn to the Sheikh and then to King Abdul Aziz would be consigned from pillar to post. I am aware that King Abdul Aziz has- bespoken his share of the oil rights in the Neutral Zone to the Standard Oil Company of California; he is reported to have hedged3 re o 0 vn f' l r ' lllwvJSk. •_/ an px rt v 1A v j LZ'Q. c/ if e Sheikh is yet &gt; it seems to me tha' txl ing for i ?.o .L. is vi th him.

The Hon*tie Lieut.-Colonel T.C.Fowle, C.B.E., political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India, The India Office, London. Subject: Request of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat for a mineralogical survey in his territories. Sir, In continuation of my letter No.707-8, dated the 25th July 1934, I enclose herewith a copy of letter No.c/200, dated the 27th November 1935, from the Political Agent, Muscat. The Sultan is not expected back from Dhofar until 2 April, by which time Petroleum Concessions Limited’s plans will have crystallized. Possibly the best plan of action would be to encourage the Company to apply for an option from His Highness on the same lines as those they have obtained from the Trucial Coast Shaikhs. It is of course important that the Sultan should not turn towards American interests. I am sending a copy of this letter to the Government of India and the Political Agent, Muscat. I have the honour to be Sir, Your most obedient servant - Lieut.-Colonel Political Resident in the Persian Gulf 3 0DEC193512th December, 1935 Sir, A I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to refer to your call at the India office on 23rd October and your letter of 24th October, 19355 regarding the proposals of Petroleum Concessions Ltd*, subject to the approval of His Majesty’s Government, to seek for oil concessions in the Kov/eit neutral zone, the unallotted part of Bahrein, the Sheikhdoms of the Trucial Coast, and possibly Muscat# The questions raised have been under consideration in consultation with the other Departments of His Majesty’s Government concerned and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and I am now to inform you that the proposals are approved on the following conditions and understandings. 2* Bahrein. There is no objection to your Company applying to the Sheikh of Bahrein for a concession, on the understanding that any concession granted would be subject to the conditions considered necessary to safeguard Government interests; these conditions would be embodied in a separate agreement between the Company and His Majesty’s Government. 3* —Uscat. There would be no objection to the Company applying *fco the Sultan of Muscat for a concession A on/ J.S. Skliros, Esq., Petroleum Concessions Ltd. , City-Gate House, Finsbury Square, E.C. 2.INDIA OFFICE, WHITEHALL, S.W, lo P.Z. 7763/35 0 Important, 4LC November 1935 0 I enclose copy of a letter from Mr. J. Skliros / / / Managing Director of the Iraq Petroleum Company, regarding / / a proposed procedure for acquiring options, and subsequently possible concessions, for oil in certain areas in the Persian Gulf. Certain points in this letter were more fully explained at an interview which I had with Mr. Skliros and Mr. Lefroy of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company on 23rd October. 2. The reason for forming a company - Petroleum Concessions, Limited - separate from the Iraq Petroleum Company is, I understood-merely that the latter company has an Iraqi Government director, and it is not considered necessary or desirable that he should participate in undertakings solely concerned with the acquisition of concessions in countries outside Iraq. 3 / G. W. Rendel, Esq., C.M.G., FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l- 2 - 3. As regards the Koweit neutral zone ? Petroleum Concessions, Limited are aware of the position of deadlock resulting' from Ibn Baud's commitment to the Standard Oil of California, but they think that by 'the offer of an arrangement to facilitate the marketing of the Bahrein Petroleum Company’s production they may obtain the necessary leverage to induce the California Company to relinquish their stranglehold on Ibn Baud’s part-interest in the Koweit neutral zone. 4 . With reference to the unallotted area of Bahrein, Mr. Lefroy did not think that this would be of value to anyone, but Mr. Skliros was inclined to think that it might be worth while to obtain sin option with a view to its examination. So far as I know, we have not entered into commitments with anyone regarding this area, so that it is presumably open to any company which desires to do so to apply to the Sheikh for a concession (subject, of course, to His Majesty’s Government’s approval). On the Trucial Coast the Anglo-Iranian Cil Company (or the D’Arcy Exploration Company) have, as you know, already obtained two-year options, subject to His/■MMMMNI ■ - 3 - HivS Majesty's Government's approval 9 at Ras al Khaimali K \ and Sharjah? Mr. Lefroy ^See papers enclosed with India Office n printed letters P.Z.5980 9 dated 2nd \ stated that they have September 1935 9 and P.Z.7001, dated 3rd ‘ October 1935 5 respectively. ^ just obtained a similar option at Debai. They are also in the field for options at Abu Dhabi 5 Ajman and Umm-al“Qaiwain. The Anglo- Iranian Oil Company would go forward with their pending negotiations 3 but any concessions for which they have acquired or may acquire options on the Trucial Coast would be negotiated and taken by Petroleum Concessions, Limited. 6 . The reference to the Pirate Coast is a geographical misunderstanding. Petroleum Concessions, Limited, might interest itself in the possibilities of Muscat, where we have not committed ourselves to anyone and the field is consequently open. 7. I stated that certain preliminary conditions to the approval of options on the Trucial Coast (which had been discussed with Fowle during his deputation) would be required by His Majesty's Government, viz.: Vis-a- vis the C ompa ny:- (a) that any geologist or employee who visits any of the Trucial Sheikhdoms for the purpose of exploring or surveying the area of the option should be of British nationality^ (b)/4 - (b) that the exploring party in their travels would be definitely guided by the views of the Resident as to where they should go 0 Vi s-a-vis t he She ikh;- (c) that the Sheikh concerned should give a definite guarantee in writing that he would be responsible for the safety of the exploring or surveying party. I added that another condition to the approval of an. option would be that further approval by His hiajesty's Government would be necessary before negotiations for an actual concession were entered into with the Sheikh concerned. 8 . The question of our future policy on the Trucial Coast, which was discussed by the Middle East Committee on 24th September, has, of course, a certain relevance to the question whether in this backward and uncivilised area the acquisition of oil concessions by any company, of whatever nationality, ought to be encouraged or permitted. The result of the meeting in regard to general policy was somewhat inconclusive, but there is, I think, nothing in the conclusions, such as they were, to suggest that we ought/5 ought to arrive at a definite decision to sterilise the Trucial Coast so far as oil is concerned 0 Indeed, the trend of the discussion was rather in the opposite direction, and Fowle himself, though he is averse from any new pronouncement of general policy, has always taken the view that in regard to oil we can hardly impose an absolute veto on concessions which the Sheikhs may wish to grant, though specially careful conditions to safeguard the interests of His Majesty’s Government and limit our commitments would be necessaryo In any case, by stipulating that the actual commencement of negotiations for a concession, apart from the conditions on which it should be granted, will be subject to His Majesty’s Government’s approval, we shall, so far as is now practicable, ensure that each case is kept open for decision by His Majesty’s Government, when the time comes, in the light of considerations of general policy and of the degree of commitment which the grant of any concession would involve. So Cn the question of nationality, it will be seen that the national complexion of Petroleum Concessions, Limited, is identical with that of the Iraq Petroleum Company. It was explained to me that Petroleum Concessions, Limited, would probably beget separate companies to exploit the/—— - 6 - the several areas in which they might be successful in obtaining concessions 9 but that such are the national jealousies on the part of the non-British elements in the Iraq Petroleum Company that there is no chance of such companies being formed on a basis of a larger proportion of British ownership than that in the Iraq Petroleum Company itself* As 9 however 9 the a.reas mentioned (apart 9 possibly 9 from the Koweit neutral zone) are within the Ked Line Agreement^ it seems necessary to be content with the Iraq Petroleum Company's proportion of British shareholding 9 since no British company outside the Iraq Petroleum Company has shown a serious interest in these areas. Holmes has indeed been angling during the last few months for the interest of an all-British group (which, however, had no experience of oil concessions), but I have now heard from him that his negotiations have definitely broken down. 10. If the Foreign Office and the other Departments concerned and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf agree, we would propose to inform Petroleum Concessions, Limited, as follows?- (a) On the Trucial Coast, subject to the conditions stated above. His Majesty’s Government approve the options already/„ 7 - already granted by the Sheikhs of Ras al Khaimah, Sharjah and Debai, and any options that may be granted by other Sheikhso If it is desired during the currency of an option to enter into negotiations with the Sheikh concerned for a concession 9 the prior approval of His Majesty’s Government will be required before such negotiations are opened. In the event of such approval to the commencement of negotiations being given, the conditions to safeguard Government interests which would have to be attached to any concession obtained would be considered and would have to be accepted by the Company before an actual concession was approved. (b) In Bahrein and Muscat there is no objection to Petroleum Concessions, Limited, applying to the rulers concerned, on the understanding that any concession granted would be subject to the conditions considered necessary to safeguard Government interests. (c) As regards the Kov/eit neutral zone, application may be made to the Sheikh of Kov/eit for an option for his part-interest in the zone, on the understanding that, if it should later become possible for the Company to seek a concession from him and Ibn Saud jointly, the prior approval of His Majesty’s Government v/ould have to be sought before the/- 8 - the Company entered into negotiations with those rulers, and any actual concession eventually granted would be subject to such conditions (which might be of a special character, in view of the peculiar juridical position of the zone) as were considered necessary to safeguard British political interests. 11 0 It will be observed that the Company propose to employ Holmes for the negotiations of actual concessions. Mr. Skliros explained that this proposal was made faute de m ieux o It is of course primarily the business of the Company whom they employ and, subject to Fowle's views, we do not think that we need make any objection. 12. If Petroleum Concessions Limited should make the application, of which the possibility is foreseen in the penultimate paragraph cf Mr. Skliros's letter, for special permission for Mr. Baker to visit‘.areas on the Trucial Coast, we could consider in consultation with Fowle the question of making' an exception in that particular case from the general rule suggested in paragraph 7 (a) above. 13. I am sending’ a similar letter to Starling and Seal, and a letter, of which a copy is enclosed, to Air Vice- Marshal Courtney. We should be grateful if you could let us have/have an early reply as we should like to let Petroleum Concessions Limited have a reply to their enquiry as soon as possible. sincerely.

The Under Secretarj^ of State, India Office, Whitehall, S.W.l Sir, I have the honour to refer to my conversation yesterday with Mr. J.C.'Walton, at which I indicated that, subject to the a. proval of His Majesty's Government, my Company, Pecroleum Concessions Limited, proposes to seek for oil concessions in the territory known as the Neutral Zone, the unallotted part of Bahrein Island, the Trucial Coast, and possibly along the Pirate Coast to Muscat. Petroleum Concessions Ltd. was registered as a private British Company on the 14th instant, the whole of its shares will be held by the same interests and in the same proportions as obtain in the Iraq Petroleum Company and the Board will be of similar composition, excepting the appointment of an Iraqi Government Director. The concession recently obtained by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Limited from the Ruler of Qatar will, at an appropriate time, be transferred to Petroleum Concessions Limited, together with the Agreements relative thereto concluded with His Majesty's Government; the provisions of these Agreements are generally acceptable to Petroleum Concessions Limited in their application to oil concessions obtained over the above named territories wherein my Company recognises, and will respect, the existence of a spe cial /special sphere of influence of His Majesty's Government. There will also be transferred to Petroleum Concessions Ltd. options for oil concessions recently obtained by the Anglo-lranian Oil Company Ltd. from the Rulers of Ras-el-Khaimah, Sharjah* Dubai and any other options obtained by that Company on our behalf in the Trucial Coast. The negotiations for the actual concessions will be undertaken by Petroleum Concessions Ltd., and in that connection it is proposed to employ Major Frank Holmes, who is acquainted with Persian Gulf matters and who, to the best of my belief, can be entrusted to conduct such negotiations with proper observance of the customs of those countries. The terms to be offered will be based on the terms of the Qatar concession with suitable adjustment of the cash payments in relation to the respective approximate areas of the concessions; the actual boundaries will be defined at a later stage as and when they are demarcated. The wishes of His Majesty's Government in regard to the employment of British subjects in these areas will be observed, but I foresee possibly applying for special permission for the Company's Chief Geologist, Mr.H.E.Baker, an American citizen, to visit these areas to compile a report on their oil potentialities. The Company will comply with any instructions issued by the Resident or his representatives in regard to the movements, and for the protection of Geological reconnaissance parties. y ' H I shall be glad to hear whether these proposals are agreeable to His Majesty's Government and whether I may have permission to proceed on the above lines with the I co-operation/3. co-operation of the Resident in the Persian Gulf, who will be kept informed of the negotiations. 1 have, etc., PETROLEUM CONCESSIONS LIMITED.

The present position in regard to oil exploitation in the Persian Gulf is summarised in the Jedda memorandum flagged below. Koweit has been acquired by an Anglo-American consortium. The Koweit Neutral Zone remains unallotted and seems likely to do so, the Saudi Government having given an option in respect of their interest in it to the Standard Oil of California, which will probably enable that Company to block progress for some time. Hasa has gone to the Standard Oil: Bahrein is held by the Bahrein Petroleum Co., a subsidiary of the Standard Oil. Qatar has now been acquired by the A.P.O.C. on behalf of the Iraq Petroleum Co. On the Trucial Coast the A.P.O.C. have been in touch with the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, and we have been facilitating/ rn facilitating their efforts to establish a foothold in this Sheikhdom, which is the most important of the Trucial Sheikhdoms because of its area. Further to the east, the Sheixvh Ox Ras-al-Khaimah has recently asked for the services of a geologist and steps have been taken to put him in touch with the A-P-O.C- The other minor Sheikhdoms are Shargah, Dibai, Ajman and Umm-al-Qaiwan, who have so far made no move. Shargah is probaoly the most important of .them. In the east of the triJ' a peninsula the A.P.O.C. f-*J' some years in respect *of Muscat, which they have now abandoned. The Sultan last year enquired whether any steps could be taken to interest British companies in oil development in his State.

From the correspondence now attached it would seem that the Burmah Oil, who when approached last year were reluctant to have anything to do with the Gulf, are definitely interesting themselves in Iraq and may possibly interest themselves in the Gulf area. At this stage we can only watch and swait developments. I gather from Mr. Starling of the Petroleum Department, who has had some conversation on the subject with the Burmah Oil and who will shortly be writing to us on the subject, that he thinks it would be unwise to entertain any exaggerated hopes. The Bumah Oil are likely to be ^^vnP-rilv/ * /»/■■ Minute Paper. Department. primarily interested in any possibilities in Ira.q. On the other hand he fully realises the desirability from our point of view of interesting a wholly British company in those of the Arabian Sheikhdoms in respect of which concessions still remain to be given. The A.P.O*C., despite the controlling British Government interest in it, suffers under the handicap thatfiT is free to operate in the Arabian peninsula outside the Koweit Neutral Zone only as a member of the I.P.C., and the I.P.C. with its American and French components p J-' *—7 ^ have the right of refusal of. any concession which the A-P.O.C. may succeed in obtaining.

Abraham, who is one of the senior Geologists of this Company. As a result of recent air traverses, en route from Burma to this country and bacA, and of a somewhat hurried general view of the geology of Iraq and the Persian Gulf, Mr. Abraham suggested to us that it might be desirable that this be studied at greater leisure and in closer detail in the direction of determining whether or not even at this late hour of competitive interest in Petroleum concessions in this region there might be some area or areas left in which we ourselves could reasonably take an interest. while in the circumstances far from hopeful, particularly in tne case of Iraq, that anything seriously worth while can have escaped the attention of and been left out of the concessions which were granted by the Iraqi Government to the Iraq Petroleum Company, Ltd: and to the 3.Q.D. Company, Ltd: respectively, we have agreed that Mr. Abraham might be given this greater time for studying every possibility throughout the whole of the Iraq/persian Gulf region not already under Concession. We should deem it a favour if Your excellency would be so kind as to assist Mr. Abraham by advising him of the steps he should take to approach the Iraqi Government with a / view His Britannic Majesty*8 Ambassador,view to entering into discussions with them to this end, and to ascertain if they are prepared to grant us the necessary facilities to take up survey work actively. In this event, and if the Iraqi Government are willing, Mr. Abraham is empowered by us to discuss and arrange with the Iraqi Government the principles governing an exploration licence and those of a relative mining lease for adoption by us as applicable to such area, if any, as we may ultimately decide might conceivably Justify active interest by us.

November, 1934, My dear Walton, So sorry not to have answered sooner your letter of the 13th September (P*Z.5384/34) about Muscat. r I did have a talk on the telephone recently with Laithwaite to find out whether the boundaries of Muscat are r fairly well defined, and whether there was a reasonably good depth of territory behind the range of hills which I understand lie at a fairly short distance from the seaboard. Because the information which I have about Muscat, and it is admittedly rather scanty, is that the territory between these hills and the seaboard is not regarded as at all promising. The information which Laithwaite gave me seemed to indicate that there is quite a good amount of territory. I think, therefore, in view of the considerable interest which has been taken in these areas along the Gulf, that it would be a good thing to endeavour to interest a British company in Muscat. J. C. Walton, Esq., India Office, Whitehall, S.W. 1.You could, of course, write to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, 'but they cannot take up this area, which is inside the Iraq Petroleum Company line. Having regard to this and the Sultan’s suggestion that he would like a second opinion, I would recommend that the Iraq Petroleum Company should 'be asked whether they would 'be prepared to consider undertaking an investigation, and if satisfied with the results, taking up a concession. Perhaps something on the lines of the arrangement made two or three years ago by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in Qatar would be a desirable one, vis., an option for (say) two years, during which a geological survey would be made. If the Iraq Petroleum Company is approached, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company will, of course, be a party, and it might be that their geological staff would undertake the investigation, but as the concession, f if granted, must go to the Iraq Petroleum Company, I see an advantage in this case in starting with them. I am sure that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company would concur in such an arrangement. I am not surprised to know that the Burmah Oil Company will not takeIf you h^ve a spare map of this area, I would be much obliged if you could let me have it.

Whilst the Admiralty realise that it would probably be difficult to persuade any British company- other than the Anglo-Persian to carry out an exploration, we nevertheless would attach great importance to keeping out American interests.

When I spoke to you I briefly indicated - as I had already done on a previous occasion - that the Burmah’s policy and general attitude in connection with producing and/or marketing interests outside of those associated with Petroleum indigenous to India and Burma had really been determined by these Indian and Burma interests themselves* For the necessity for their protection against serious foreign aggression in the form of neighbouring geographical producers had been responsible for our association with the Royal-Dutch Shell Group from 19^5 onwards and for our participation with D’Arcy in the search for and development of Oil in Southern Persia* The latter soon grew into a very large financial stake and the gradual elabor: ation of the former culminated in the steps taken in 1927/8 - to make permanent the protection it had given us - in us forming Burmah-Shell and in making a large financial investment in -the Shell Company. And each of these arrangements very naturally, in the circumstances, gave us every reason to foster close relations between these two interests themselves and, as far as possible, remove points of potential competition between them by bringing them together in marketing association. From all this it naturally and logically follows that our direct and active interest in Petroleum should normally be confined to the area we have thus protected against the ambitions at any rate of these two concerns and that for any interest in Petroleum outside of this area we should confine ourselves to our invests ments in these Companies. For although we are entirely and absolutely free to interest ourselves anywhere else in Petroleum, such an interest could only mean that, were wePIT auls Kershaj: 7.Q.1°^4; we successful, we would inevitably come into competition with and damage our own investments. It is, however, true that these might be equally or even more greatly damaged by some one other than they taking our place and that we might, as here with Muscat, therefore not merely control that damage itself but prevent damage even to our Indian interests possible from a successful Muscat were it in unfriendly lands. I agree that there might at any time be a dilemma for us with these two horns. Bahrein is an example. In such a case, even in our associates 1 own interest it might be best for us to -go in-. I don-t therefore dogmatically say , that our present policy could not and, in certain circumstances, should not be reversed But obviously we cannot ssmlsltto protect either India or our associates. And already Bahrein's fate has made a breach in our defences which may make further such attempts at protection merely stupid because of possibly weakening of our resources while still leaving Baiirein to attack us. The fate of Bahrein is certainly an example; but a warning which has come too late and which itself has reduced, if not possibly entirely removed ell advantage in attesting to prevent a repetition with Muscat. I am myself in: clined to think that this is so. In all the circumstances I prefer to put the responsibility on the geological side. If they be proved wrong in the sequel, then Bahrein and Koweit - into neither of which were we ever invited to project ourselves to secure British interests - have possibly so altered and defeated our schemes and plans to defend India's Petroleum industry *** that a superimposed Muscat makes no difference. And geologically Muscat is a 'wash out' so far as commercial ,il is concerned so feat my reply to you must be that I am so advised and that, therefore, apart from other considerations, I swat refuse - but wife many thanks to rou personally for/fe'e suggestion that we might open negotiations for examination preliminary to Petroleum concessions. lours sincerely. iir Louis Kershaw,K.C.S.I., C.I.E., I.C.S.

T- &lt;&gt;y s Please see Colonel Loch’s despatch of 25th July below. It is not unnatural that the Sultan of Muscat should want to secure any profits there are from oil deposits in his territories, his financial position being as difficult as it is, nor is it altogether surprising, considering the attitude of the Persian Gulf Rulers to the A.P.O.C., that he should be anxious to /U. . , , V J jy /y secure a second opinion. /}*./&lt;. \(btf , ^ i/ on the grounds of policy, it is very desirable b%£ kj*h &lt; y keep the exploitation of Muscat oil deposits in f^v*/ ^ hands » particularly as the Sultan is definitely internationally an independent Ruler whose foreign relations we do not control and who has treaties with the United States Government. But Muscat falls within the Red Line agreement and if the A.P.O.C. obtain a concession there, we shall have to face the possibility lc 0 j?* ^yiq introduction of a non-British element in its 2f 4 * 4 ^. ^ exploitation - and we shall be on worse ground in 4^ 4/^ opposing such a request in that we do not control the X^c/ Sultan’s foreign relations. The position, it may be ^ added, will be hardly less difficult than the position in respect of the Koweit neutral zone, unless the Sultan is prepared to grant and the concessionaires to accept a concession in respect of the coastal area. The Hinterland of Oman is occupied by fanatical tribes, partlxralBrly independent of the Sultan and under the control of the Imam of Oman. Certain of the tribes in south-eastern Muscat at Sur and Jaalan have pronounced Wahabi tendencies and have been kept under control onxy as the result of armed support of the Sultan’s authority. The/ i 1 nThe rich territory of Dhofar, which lies between Sur and the borders of the-£b» Protectorate, is equally extremely uncivilised, though subject in a greater degree than Sur to the Sultan’s authority. Finally, the Hinterland borders of Muscat are undefined, and we might conceivably find ourselves faced with a contest on the subject between the Sultan and Ibn Saud. It is therefore of much importance that any exploitation should be on terms laid down by us (the Sultan is, of course, precluded from granting a concession without our consent, but there is more to it than that) and that the exploiting company and its personnel should possibly be British. Sir Louis Kershaw some time ago said that he would mention to the Burmah Oil Company the possibilities offered by the Persian Gulf. I do not know if they reacted favourably. But whatever doubts they might feel about places relatively remote from their normal sphere, such as Koweit, Hasa, and Bahrein, they might conceivably be prepared to take a slightly more active interest in Muscat, most of which faces India and which is very closely connected commercially and otherwise with India and Burmal Would he think it worth while broaching the question with them? Failing that, there is nothing for it, I think, but to let the Anglo-Persian try again. There is no other respectable company. The B.O.D. is unreliable, the Burmsli ex h ypothesi would not co-operate, the Shell are part of the A.P.O.C* combine, as are the I.P.C. The A.P.O.C., I may add, have always told me that they did not think there was any oil in Muscat, but they also stated that the exploration was somev/hat perfunctory, while the fact that oil in apparently commercial quantities exists in Bahrein and/3. and probably Koweit and Katr despite the fact that the original investigations of the A.P.O.C. suggested that this was not the case in any one of these three principalities, makes it possible that further exploration would produce satisfactory results in the case of Muscat. As regards the Trucial Sheikhs, our present policy is to sterilise their Sheikhdoms. The longer we hold to this the better in existing political conditions. It will probably suit both British and American oil interests that we should do so so long as controluf oil exploitation is absolute. 1 do not think we need much concern ourselves in this instance about the position of | the Sheikhs. They are half savage and while they woul d naturally be anxious to improve their financial position so far as possible, the results of financial stringency politically are not the same as they would be in Bahrein, Koweit, Muscat, or even Katr. The responsibilities which would fall on us as the result of actual exploitation are so heavy (and the extremely indefinite position oi the Trucial Hinterland is not the least of the problems that would arise) that we must, I think, consult our own interests first. We might make this clear to Colonel Loch in replying. We have never laid down a positive oil policy in regard to the Trucial Shekhdome. though in the various informal discussions that have taken place the assumption has been that our policy would be one of sterilisation. ^ ^i Copy attached Confidential.

The Political Agent reports that at a recent meeting with him His Highness the Sultan expressed his earnest desire for a further survey to be carried out. He pointed out to His Highness that neither the exploration carried out by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company nor the geological information furnished by Lees (see paragraph 9 of Muscat Diary No.l of 1926) gave much hope of petroleum being discovered, whilst the coal discovered by Sir Percy Cox in the Sur hinterland was too far off to be a market able proposition. His Highness was not, however, deterred from the idea and requested thathe might be permitted to make his own arrangements if Government were unable to put forward a Company. The Political Agent did not think it advisable//■ r— * t ®) advisable at this stage to remind His Highness that by treaty he was unable to grant concessions without the sanction of His Majesty’s Government. 3 . He adds that His Highness’s desire for a Company other than the Anglo-Persian Oil Company to carry out the survey is promptedj he considersj more by a desire to have a second opinion from a fresh source than to exclude the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. The position at present is that His Highness the 4. Sultan is bound by an undertaking 5 given in 1902, that he would not grant a concession for working the coal fields in the hinterland of Sur to any foreign government or Company until an opportunity had been given to the British Government of undertaking the work in conjunction with the Sultan him self (Treaties, Sanads and Engagements. Aitchison. Volume XI, pages 283 and 318); and by an undertaking,given in 1923, that he would not exploit, or give permission for exploiting, petroleum in his territories without consulting the Political Agent and without the approval of the Government of India (Treaties, Sanads and Engagements. Aitchison. Volume XI, pages 284 and 319)• 5* In the winter of 1925-26 the Anglo-Persian Oil Company carried out a preliminary exploration under the terms of the concession obtained by them in 1925(see Lieutenant- Colonel Crosthwaite*s despatch l\ r o*13 dated the 6 th June 1925 to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for the Colonies, a copy of which was sent to the Government of India under Residency endorsement No.l90-S of the same date), but I do not know whether the Company were able to form any definite conclusions and it is possible that they may still be interested in that r—M.r—r*—1 z 7 2 //- 2 2 - -3- P'Gn k'** ^7'* pAjjs 6* t#rKfi*l*VK VAA (/5c k*+J tvv.

It would be interests were tp&lt; / ' / establish themselves in 'Omanj as in that case it wou^dnot be easy, in spite of the undertakings given by^he frucial Chiefs, to prevent their absorbing the Trucial Coast and perhaps even Qatar. 7. I would suggest that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company should be sounded with a view to finding out whether they would be prepared to proceed with their exploration in 'Oman and, if successful, to exploit oil there. If they are not prepared to do so, I think that every endeavour should be made to ensure that the exploration is carried out if possible by other British interests, with a view, in particular, to preventing 1 Oman falling into the hands ot the Standard Oil Company of California. 8 .

Bremner, M.C., Political Agent and H.B.M.Consul, Muscat A. C. The object of writing this letter is to state that I desire that a further drilling (exploration) may be carried out again in certain parts of my dominions for minerals especially petrol. Some years ago the officials of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company did carry out the exploration but the result was not successful. I would therefore like another Company to carry out the operations. I shall be pleased if you will represent my request to my friend the Government. I shall deem it a great assistance if the Government recommend another Company if they have any in view for this purpose. Or else I will communicate direct with the Companies who search for minerals in the world and carry out such operations and authorise them to undertake the work. In view of my financial stringency, as you are aware, I deem it essential to see to what is beneficial (to my country) and to pray God for help.

Lees and Gray, geologists in the employ of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, or more correctly of the D*Arcy Exploration Company the parent Company responsible for all exploration work - returned to Muscat from their two months’ travelling on the 26th December 1926. no t I attach a sketch map showing the places visited by attached them. Mr. Lees informs me that they had a most successful expedition and were universally well treated by the Shaikhs and tribesmen. Captain Eccles, Commanding the Muscat Infantry, accompanied the party and superintended all the social and political part of their travels, while 'Abdulla Williamson (an Englishman who has become Muslim and who is employed by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company as a 'Sales Superintendent') assisted him and looked after the transport. Mr* Lees was naturally reticent on the subject of oil and I equally naturally did not question him. H would appear however that no indications of oil were found. Do minerls were found except two worked out copper mines, whose existence even was not known to the neighbouring villagers. Mr.Lees told me that the persons who had found the copper mines must have been very knowledgeable as the indications of copper were very meagre. There is a good deal of iron in the hills and the geologists lound that this seriously affected their compasses if placed on the ground. It// - 2 - O It* is an interesting tact that the geologists were invited by the Shaikhs of Baraimi to visit that tract, but the invitation was due to a hope that their presence would stop Isa bin Saleh coming to Baraimi, as the latter was then successfully advancing up the Dhahira in the direction of Baraimi• Mr. Lees tells me that on two occasions shots were fired across the advance of their caravan by Bedouins but when they made themselves known, the Bedouins were quite friendly. On one occasion Mr. Lees was on a hill collecting specimen rocks alone when a very uncouth shepherd began to throw stones at him. This nuisance being continually repeated, Mr. Lees charged the shepherd waving his geological hammer, whereat the shepherd fled. This was the only incident of the sort, and this lonely shepherd had probably not heard of the arrival of the travellers and could not make out what strange being had invaded his solitude. The party were accompanied by a botanist, a Mr.Fernandez of the Bombay Natural History Society. Mr. Lees appears to have been generously provided with presents for the Shaikhs and all concerned by his Company, and the expedition was a great success from the “politicar' point of view. Messrs. Lees and Gray left Muscat on the British India Mail Steamer on the 3rd instant for Bombay. There they join H.M.S.'Triad” which is proceeding to Dhofar to fetch His Highness the Sultan back to Muscat. The geologists will now explore Dhofar. The length of their stay there will depend on the character of the geological formations, and whether the same give hopes of oil. The country round Sur and Masira Island will be explored later if the tribesmen and Shaikhs are amenable. x x x x x x xl 4d\yC^C4&lt;A f' A (h) ^1 jC tip* i r/w W, P.Z/9 29/34.

LAITHWAITS.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT EASTERN (Arabia). August 11, 1933. CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1. [E 4540/487/25] No. 1. Memorandum respecting Petroleum in Arabia (as revised by Petroleum Department.—(Received in Foreign Office, August 11, 1933.) (A)— Petroleum Prospects of Arabia. (1) LITTORAL Region of the Hejaz. —Petroliferous deposits and seepage have long been known to exist in this area. Interest in it was stimulated by Mr. Twitchell’s survey in 1931 in the coastal region north of Jedda, but this area seems to have dropped into the background of late. In a report furnished by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company to the Petroleum Department in 1932, it was pointed out that the general structure of the Red Sea is known geologically as a “ Rift Valley,” that is, a sunken valley bounded on either side by rift faults. The prospects of finding oil in commercial quantity are considered to be remote, though not entirely non-existent, and even after a complete survey, Rift Valley conditions ” are such that any test drilling would be very speculative. (2) Hasa and Koweit Neutral Zone. —It has been thought for many years that this region might produce oil. The idea that it may be underlain by rocks of the same geological age as those of the Iraq and Persian oil-fields, and that potential oil structures might exist extending from Koweit to Qatar inclusive, has been encouraged by the striking of oil in quantity in Bahrein in 1932. (3) The Farsan Islands and A sir. —Interest in these islands and/or the mainland of Asir, from the point of view of petroleum potentialities, seems to date from before the Great War. Operations were actually started on one of the islands by the Red Sea Petroleum Company, a subsidiary of the Shell Group, in 1926 or early in 1927. but drilling operations were subsequently abandoned as unsuccessful. As to Asir, see (D) (2). (4) Mohalla.—Ta 1928-29 the Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company (Shell Group) carried out investigations, and reached the conclusion that the petroleum prospects were quite unfavourable. (5) Muscat. —The Anglo-Persian Oil Company abandoned this area as unfavourable in 1925-26. (B) Interested or Potentially Interested Companies. (1) The Iraq Petroleum Company. —The Turkish Petroleum Company (now the Iraq Petroleum Company) was formed in 1912, when the Deutsche Bank became associated with the National Bank of Turkey and the Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company (Royal Dutch Shell Group), in order to press certain claims to oil rights in Bagdad and Mosul, including those attached to the Bagdad Railway Concession. The chief rival of the new company at that time was the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, which had for some time been in negotiation with the &amp; Turkish Government. In 1914 an agreement was entered into providing for the reconstitution of the Turkish Petroleum Company, from which the National Bank of Turkey withdrew, the new participants being the Anglo- Persian Oil Company, 50'per cent.; the Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company and the Deutsche Bank, 25 per cent. each. This agreement also provided that the three groups should give undertakings not to be interested directly or indirectly in the production of oil in the Ottoman Empire in Europe and Asia (excluding Egypt, Koweit and the Transferred Territories), except through the Turkish Petroleum Company. This agreement was signed by the British and German Governments, and by the groups concerned. As the Turkish Petroleum Company was then predominantly British, this arrangement had the effect of securing the whole of this area to interests which were predominantly British. After the war American and French interests were admitted into the Iraq Petroleum 7013 [879 1—1] b2 Company and the arrangement as regards non-competition between the groups composing the Iraq Petroleum Company was confirmed in an agreement between the groups, entered into in 1928. This was a private agreement between the groups with which the British Government was not associated. Under this agreement a line was drawn round Arabia, Palestine and Asia Minor, which excluded the Sultanate of Koweit and the Farsan Islands, but included Bahrein, and an area was thus defined within which the various groups constituting the Iraq Petroleum Company agreed that they would not seek for or obtain oil concessions otherwise than through the Iraq Petroleum Company or its nominee. On the admission of French and American interests the share capital of the Iraq Petroleum Company was distributed as follows :— Anglo-Persian Oil Company Percentage. 23-75 Royal Dutch Shell 23-75 French Group 23 75 American Group( 1 ) 23-75 C. S. Gulbenkian 500 10000 As the Royal Dutch Shell is 60 per cent. Dutch and 40 per cent. British, the British shareholding in the company now only represents about 33J per cent. The Iraq Petroleum Company is still technically a British company, as in article 32 of its convention with the Government of Iraq the company must be and remain a British company, registered in Great Britain, and the'chairman must at all times be a British subject. But the position is different from a British point of view, from that which formerly obtained when the company was British in fact as well as in name. Apart from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and the Burmah Oil Company, there are no really large oil companies which are entirely British, and which could compete with the big groups represented on the Iraq Petroleum Company. The Burmah Oil Company has never been inclined to undertake exploration work outside India. There may, however, be some instances where the Iraq Petroleum Company is not prepared to seek concessions in the reserved area, and where the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, either by itself or in association with one or more of the other groups, may be allowed to acquire concessions. (2) British Oil Development Company and Mosul Oil-fields {Limited ).—On the 20th April, 1932, the Iraq Government granted an oil concession to the British Oil Development Company (Limited) over the western portion of Iraq. The concession is for a period of seventy-five years and covers an area of about 40,000 square miles, comprising all Iraq lands situated west of the River Tigris and north of the thirty-third parallel of latitude. A special law confirming the British Oil Development Concession was passed and published in the Official Gazette on the 29th May, 1932. This is reckoned as the date of the commence ment of the concession. The company must be and remain a British company registered in Great Britain, and the chairman must be a British subject. There is, however, a large foreign interest in the company. The British Oil Develop ment Company was first registered in 1928 with a' nominal capital of £82 500 the original directors being Sir Edward Manville (chairman), Sir Edward Mountain (chairman of the Eagle Star and British Dominions Insurance Company) (Sir E. Mountain subsequently became chairman of the British Oil Development Company), the late Admiral Lord Wester Wemyss, W. R. Brown (representing Lord Inverforth), General Sir A. Mola (Italy), three’representatives of the Italian Azienda Generale Italiana Petroli, and E. C. Simmons (solicitor) At some stage, but when it actually occurred is not clear from the information available, German and Franco-Swiss interests were also included. (!) In 1932 the American shareholding- in the American group (Near East Development Corporation) was held in the following proportions :— F -Percentage. standard Oil Company of New Jersey .. .. .. . # 412 . ■Standard Oil Company of New York (now the Socony-Vacuum Company) 41^ Gulf Oil Corporation of Pennsylvania .. .. .. . # ig|3 The capital in 1931 was stated to be held in the following proportions :— British Percentage. 52 Italian 24 German 12 Franco-Swiss ... 12 100 In December 1932 a new company was formed, known as “ Mosul Oil-fields (Limited),” to acquire the shares in the British Oil Development Company and to carry on its operations. The company had a nominal capital of £1 million in £1 shares. In March 1933 the board of this company was reconstructed, and the Foreign Office was informed by the company that the directorate was as follows :— Viscount Goschen (chairman). Other British directors (5) : Sir Edward Mountain (deputy chairman), the late Admiral Lord Wester Wemyss, Lord Glenconner (director of Hambro’s Bank), W. R. Brown (director of British Union Oil Company), and Sir Alwin Dickinson (formerly the representative of the British Government on the British Phosphate Commission) as managing director. Italian directors (3) : Professor Alessandro Martelli, Gr. Uff. Arnaldo Petretti, and Gr. Uff. Vittorio Amoretti (Azienda Generale Italiana Petroli). German directors (2) : Herr Thomas Brown and Herr M. Hirschfeld. French director (1) : M. Paul Girod. Iraq Government director (1) : Jafar Pasha-el-Askeri; a total of thirteen. The company is not known to be at present interested in Saudi Arabia. (3) The Anglo-Persian Oil Company (A.P.O.C). —See at (1) above as to A.P.O.C.’s participation in the I.P.C. and the restrictions imposed thereby. The A.P.O.C. has, however, in addition to its main concession in Persia, which has been confirmed by a revised agreement with the Persian Government, dated the 29th April, 1933, a separate interest also in Iraq, where, through its subsidiary, the Khaniqin Oil Company, it has a concession in the “ Transferred Territories ” under agreements with the Iraq Government on the 30th August, 1925, and the 24th May, 1926. It also has freedom of action in Koweit, where it is competing for a concession with the Eastern and General Syndicate, representing the Gulf Oil Corporation. (4) The Eastern and General Syndicate. —This is a British company registered in August 1920 with a nominal capital of £125,300. The chairman and managing director is E. W. Janson, and the other directors are F. W. Gamble, H. T. Adams and P. C. Tarbutt. It has, at various times, acquired concessions in Bahrein and Arabia, but has never carried out any reallv effective work, its sole object being apparently to obtain concessions and traffic in them to other parties. The company at one time approached the Anglo-Persian without success, and in 1927 and 1929 transferred its interests to the Eastern Gulf Oil Corporation of U.S.A. (see under (5) below). Its local representative is Major F. Holmes. (5) The Gulf Oil Corporation is a wholly American concern, working in the Near East through its subsidiary, the Eastern Gulf Oil Company. The Gulf Oil Corporation is a powerful company engaged in producing, transporting, refining and marketing oil throughout the United States, east of the Rocky Mountains. It is also engaged in producing oil in Mexico, Venezuela and Colombia, and markets oil extensively in Europe. The principal interest in it is that of the Mellon family, who are said to have come in originally as financiers and to have ended up with an 80 per cent, interest. The Gulf is an independent company, but it is interested with the Socony-Vacuum Company (a recent merger of the Standard Oil Company of New York and Vacuum Oil Company), and S.O., New Jersey, in the I.P.C. It is also interested with the Eastern and General Syndicate in a possible concession in Koweit. In 1927 it obtained an option from the Eastern and General on the Bahrein Concession, which the syndicate had secured in December 1925. Eventually, however, this concession was taken over by the Standard Oil of California, presumably because the Gulf, as a member of the I. P.C., could not hold it. In 1929 it acquired from the Eastern and General [879 1—1] B 2Syndicate an option over any rights which the syndicate might possess in Ilasa^, the neutral zone and Koweit. It could only operate concessions in Ilasa and probably also in the neutral zone with the permission of the I.P.C. {fa) Standard Oil Company of California .—After the break-up of the Standard Oil Group in 1912, many members of the group became independent, including the above company. This company is one of the largest oil companies in the United States, and is a complete unit, being engaged in producing, refining, transporting and marketing crude oil and refined products. The company is engaged in production in eight States in the United States, and has oil propeities in Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela. The Standard Oil Company of California and the Gulf are independent of each other, although there is a general impression that the various Standard Oil Companies still have some community of interest and are prepared to co-operate in matters of general policy. At times, however, there has been keen competition between them. As pointed out above, hh e Standard Oil Company of California holds the Bahrein Concession, which it operates through the Bahrein Petroleum Company, a Canadian Corporation. It has also just secured from Ibn Saud an oil concession in Hasa, full particulars of which are not yet available. (C)— Past Concessions affecting Saudi A rabia. (1) Northern Hejaz— It is possible that certain concessionary rights were granted in Turkish times, but this subject has not been explored m the Legation. There was talk of a concession under the Hashimite regime and Mr. Philby was one of those interested, but there is no evidence of a Hashimite concession having been granted Any interest of Mr. Philby’s is presumably identical with that of Midian (Limited), an inactive but still going concern, closely allied with Sharqieh (Limited). „ A x ^ , (2) Jedda (Hejaz, West Coast of Arabia).—Two American engineers (Twitchell and Crane) carried out investigations for oil in 1931. The Petroleum Department brought the matter to the notice of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, who replied that the geological prospects in this area were not regarded as favourable (see under paragraph (A) (1)). , . , . . (3) Muscat. —The Anglo-Persian Oil Company obtained a concession in 192o to prospect for oil for a period of two years with the right to a mining lease, but this concession has now lapsed. (4) Mokalla. —The Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company started negotiations for a concession in 1928-29, but the matter was not proceeded with as they reached the conclusion that the prospects of discovering petroleum were quite unfavourable. ^ , , , i £ (5) Hasa —The Anglo-Persian Oil Company applied, probably for nrospecting rights only, to Ibn Saud in 1921. The E.G.S. came into the field later At°the beginning of 1923 Major Holmes submitted a draft concession to Sir P Cox In March 1923, the latter, acting under instructions from home, suggested to Ibn Saud that he should decide nothing until he had had an opportunity of considering an offer by A.P.O.C., whom His Majesty’s Government considered to have a prior claim. About the same period or earlier the two companies were in touch with each other with a view to sharing interest^ and it is stated that at one point they went through a pretence of breaking oft negotiations so that Ibn Saud might give the concession to E.G.S m ignorance of the interest of A P O.C., to whom he was hostile. Be that as it may, E.G.b. sot the concession, and on the 6th May, 1923, Ibn Saud granted an oil concession (including the Qatif and Jubail areas) to the Eastern and General Syndicate. Mai or Holmes gave an undertaking not to sell any part of the concession to the A P O G and His Majesty’s Government thought of trying to induce I bn Saud to cancel this restriction, but the proposal was abandoned in May 1924. Thus rhp \ P O C were left out in the cold. 1 . The final terms of the concession to E.G.S. are not known, but there are indications that it followed the draft which had been submitted to Sir P. Cox That draft, and probably the actual concession, included inter aha, provision for the following (a) Uapse of the concession if E.G.S. should fail to start operations m a specified manner within nine months. (b) Government right to cancel the concession after any continuous cessation of operations for more than twenty months.V 5 (c) Payment of £3,000 a year for “special protection' in half-yearly pay ments, to begin sixty days after date. (d) Payment of £6,000 under pain of nullity of the concession, sixty days after date. (e) Arbitration in the event of any dispute. It is not clear what, if anything, E.G.S. did to implement the undertaking to start operations. It is known that on the 26th April, 1924, two geologists of theirs left Koweit to make a preliminary survey in “ Nejd, Koweit Neutral Zone and Hasa,” but it is not known to what this led. Anyhow, Major Holmes was in difficulties with Ibn Saud in October 1925, because, according to Bushire telegram to the Colonial Office of the 31st October, {a) Ibn Saud had refused to alter a clerical error of date, and (b) E.G.S. would advance no more money. There was also apparently difficulty in obtaining financial support in London owing to the non-existence of British diplomatic representation at Nejd. It was probably at this time or a little later that E.G.S. and Major Holmes estranged Ibn Saud by refusing a payment which he claimed. There is no evidence that Ibn Saud formally cancelled the concession at this juncture. When, however, E.G.S. entered into an agreement with the Gulf Company on the 30th November, 1927. in regard to this, the Neutral Zone Concession and the hoped-for concession in Koweit, they admitted that both the former were “at least subject to forfeiture and cancellation, if not actually null and void.” The negotiations which led to the grant of a concession in Hasa to the Standard Oil of California are understood to have been conducted by that company directly, and not through the intervention of the E.G.S. (ft) Koweit Neutral Zone .—On the 17th May, 1924. an oil concession is alleged to have been granted jointly by Ibn Saud and the Sheikh of Koweit to the E.G.S. The E.G.S., by an agreement of the 30th November, 1927, transferred any rights which it might possess or acquire or which could be reinstated in Hasa or the Neutral Zone as well as in Koweit to the Eastern Gulf Oil Company. The history of the concession is somewhat obscure. A recent Colonial Office memo randum concludes from a review of the known facts the “ impression . . . . that Ibn Saud did actually grant the concession on his own without the consent of the Sheikh of Koweit.” As against this, E.G.S. definitely claimed to have got the concession from both, and it seems hardly likely that they would have committed themselves to this statement if it were untrue, in their definite legal agreement with the Gulf Company of the 30th November, 1927, as they certainly did. In any case, however, the grounds for considering this concession to have lapsed are even stronger than in the case of the Hasa Concession. E.G.S. not only admitted in the agreement with Gulf that it was like the other ‘ ‘ at least subject to forefeiture,” &amp;c., but stated in a letter to the Colonial Office of the 19th December, 1928, that it had “never been made operative.” The Sheikh of Koweit’s account of this concession is given in a recent despatch from the Political Agent dated the 6th July, 1933, which states that the Political Resident had an interview with the sheikh and discussed the matter. The sheikh’s recollection was that Ibn Saud gave the Hasa Concession proper to Major Holmes in the spring of 1923, its chief clause being that unless Major Holmes started work within three years the concession would lapse. Ibn Saud wrote in the summer of 1923 and sent the sheikh a draft draft joint concession in respect of the Koweit Neutral Zone, which he wished to give to Major Holmes’s company, the E.G.S., and asking the sheikh to sign it. His Majesty’s Government informed the sheikh that he could sign the joint concession. The concession was actually signed in April 1924, and consisted of only four pages, and it was duly sent on to Ibn Saud. About a year afterwards Major Holmes had a disagreement with Ibn Saud, who informed Major Holmes that the joint Neutral Zone Concession was there and then cancelled. Ever since the Sheikh of Koweit has assumed the joint concession to be a dead letter, that is to say, from about April 1925. The Sheik of Koweit has been unable to ascertain whether Ibn Saud has included the Neutral Zone in the Hasa Concession recently granted to the Standard Oil Company of California. (7) Farsan Islands, now also a fart of Saudi Arabia. —E.G.S. would appear to have obtained some sort of a concession for the Farsans (and possibly the mainland of Asir) from Hasan-al-Idrisi in 1926. It is not clear what became of this concession, if the grant was complete, but it was superseded by a concession6 for the Farsans given by the Idrisi on the 25th September, 1926, to a Mr. Cooper, who marketed it to the Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company (Royal Dutch Shell Group). The latter formed the Red Sea Petroleum Company to work it. This company started operations of some importance at Zifaf Island. The Idrisi, acting, it was thought at the time, under Italian influence, but more probably under that of Ibn Sand, made difficulties in the summer of 1927. After abortive efforts by the company to overcome them, Ibn Saud came forward ostensibly in the role of honest broker between the Idrisi, now his vassal, and the company. A conference held at Wizan in December 1927 under his auspices between the representatives of the company and the Idrisi was again abortive. Ibn Saud eventually intimated £&lt; a decision in the question of the dispute which we were asked to settle between the Red Sea Petroleum Company and the Idrisi Govern ment ” to the effect that a new concession should be drawn up and that in the meantime it would be undesirable to accede to a request which the company had put forward for permission to transfer their operations from Zifaf to Great Farsan. He suggested that the company should send a representative to Jedda to negotiate the revised concession. On his persisting in this attitude the company decided to withdraw from the islands and in September 1928 they removed all material under the auspices of H.M.S. Dahlia. It must be assumed that this terminated any rights under the Cooper Concession. The Shell Company has recently stated that it is not interested to reopen operations in the Farsan Islands. (D)— Present Position. Whatever view T might possibly be held as to the legal position in regard to past concessions, it is quite certain that Ibn Saud believes himself to be quit of all of them and he is probably right. The position in regard to the various areas may be summed up as follows :— (1) Northern Hejaz. —Midian (Limited), closely associated with Sharqieh (Limited) or some other concern, may have had rights in this area, but there is no reason to think that they survive. No one seems to be actively interested at present. .(2) A sir. —Ibn Saud in June 1933 intimated that he would be prepared to consider offers for a concession from British companies. The matter was referred by the Petroleum Department to the I.P.C. within whose sphere of influence Asir fell and who were the only company with any British interests who were likely to be prepared to consider the matter. The I.P.C. have intimated that they are prepared to send out geologists to make an examination if they can secure the necessary rights without payment during the exploratory period. (3) Hasa. —After some competition between the Iraq Petroleum Company (who sent a representative out to negotiate in 1933) and the Standard Oil Company of California, a concession was ultimately granted to the latter. It is under stood from information obtained from the I.P.C. that the concession was signed on the 29th May, 1933, the terms being an initial payment of £30,000 (gold) and a further deferred payment of £20,000 (gold) with a royalty at 55 . per ton. (4) Qatar. —The A.P.O.C., acting on their own initiative but with the object of transfer to the I.P.C., secured an exclusive option from the sheikh to carry out geological investigations for a period of two years with the right to apply for a concession within that period. A draft concession approved by the I.P.C. has recently been submitted by the A.P.O.C. to the sheikh. (5) Koweit Neutral Zone. —The present position in regard to this area is not clear. It may be true that Major Holmes’s primary object in coming to Jedda in April 1933 was to obtain Ibn Sand's consent to a regrant, so far as the Saudi Government are concerned, of a concession for this area. But it may also be the case that so far as Ibn Saud is concerned, he has included the Neutral Zone with the Hasa Concession. This position is at present under consideration by His Majesty's Government. (6) Farsan Islands. —There has been no activity since 1928 and both the Shell and the Anglo-Persian have recently informed the Petroleum Department that they are not interested any longer in obtaining a concession over these islands.

As I told you in my letter of the 23rd March, No#P# Z. 1974/36, we consulted the G-overnment of India and Resident about this. We now have their reply, in which they raise what appears to be an insuperable difficulty. The Sultan of Muscat, who was expected back in his capital in April, is now intending to spend several months longer in the interior of his State (in Dhofar), where he is inaccessible except by a prolonged desert journey or, in emergency, by R.A.F. aeroplanes. In these circumstances, it would be exceedingly difficult for Major Holmes to get in touch with him, and it looks .Skliros Esq., Petroleum Concessions Ltd., as/ City-Gate House, Finsbury Square, E.C. 2.2 . as if any detailed negotiations will have to he left over till next season. In the meantime the Political Agent will explain the position generally to the Sultan hut without showing him a copy of the draft concession, and ascertain his reactions. 3. On the other hand&gt; we have now heard from the Government of India and the Political Resident in reply to our telegram about the Trucial Coast proposals of your Company, and I am in a position to inform you that there will he no objection to negotiations being started with these rulers, on the basis of the draft concessions, subject to the following conditions and observations. (l) The Resident has by letters dated 9th March informed the 5 Sheikhs concerned that the options obtained by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company are approved, subject to the acceptance by the Sheikh of responsibility for the safety of any exploring party. When a reply is received from each Sheikh accepting this liability. Colonel Fowle will again communicate with him, informing hjm that, with the approval of His Majesty’s Government, Petroleum Concessions Limited, in which the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company is a partner, will enter into negotiations under/Q 3 3. under the option for the grant of a concession. The way will then he open to Major Holmes. (2) Major Holmes will he required to keep in close touch with the Political Agent, Bahrein and keep him informed of the progress of the negotiations. (3) No concession can, of course, he finally concluded without the specific further approval of His Majesty’s Government, who will require the Company to enter into a separate ’’political” agreement with them* (4) It will he sufficient at this stage to define the boundaries of the concessions as those of the respective Sheikhdoms without attempting to prepare maps. (5) As regards the protection of the Company’s employees, in the event of a concession heing obtained and operated, responsibility will fall on the Sheikh concerned. As a corollary of this, it is proposed to include in the 'political” agreement a clause to the effect that any movements of employees entailing special risks (e.g. penetration for more than a certain distance away from the coast) should he subject to the prior written permission of the Sheikh.4.

Major T/atts who is flying down there shortly to see the Sultan could inform him, without producing any specific agreement, that the P.C.L. wished to operate in his territory, and then report on his reactions. I explained that one of the difficulties that the Company will have to face in this area 7 /as that the Sultan had only effective control of the coast. Major H. said that expert opinion generally was that the oil-bearing area probably lay between SUR and HHOIAR. I pointed out that this was somewhat unfortunate as in this area, except for Sur and Dhofar themselves, the Sultan’s control even over the coast was very light. However, it was agreed that there was no particular hurry about Muscat territory, and in the meantime Major H. would have plenty to occupy himself v/ith in Bahrain and the Trucial Coast. T.C.F.

This thesis is being boomed by Philby. He develops it in an article in the Egyptian Gazette of January lUth, which you have doubtless seen or can see in the Office. He supplements it in conversation and may presently do so in print by suggesting that Great Britain is doing in Arabia what Italy is doing in Abyssinia but more cleverly. In one conversation with me he coupled my name with that of Benito Mussolini but when I begged him to substitute M His Majesty*s Government in the United Kingdom' for mine he assented. I am sending copies of this letter to Bushire Bahrain and Kuwait.INDEXED TELEPHONE : NATIONAL 3582 CODES : BENTLEY'S SECOND PHRASE BENTLEY’S COMPLETE PHRASE WITH OIL SUPPLEMENT LOMBARD TELEGRAMS : INLAND : PETCONCESS, FINSQUARE, LONDON FOREIGN : PETCONCESS, LONDON PETROLEUM CONCESSIONS LIMITED !

Walton It is now nearly five months since I first addressed the India Office on the subject of the wish of Petroleum Concessions Limited to apply for concessions in the Persian Gulf. I realise that'the Persian Gulf is a region which t presents problems requiring special consideration from a number of different departments. On the other hand, it is also a region where the working year has to be compressed into the eight months October to May, and there is some danger that if a decision is too long delayed, it will be impossible to start negotiations with any of the Rulers in that part of the world until next October, and so a whole season will be lost. On looking through the correspondence again I see that in your letter P«£«»8856/35 of the 12th December last you stated that there would be no objection to our applying for concessions to the Shaikh of uahrain and to the Sultan ox Muscat on the understanding that any con cessions granted would be subject to conditions which would be embodied in separate agreements between P»C»L« and H.L’L's Government. And in your d.o. P«Z»9314/3G, dated the 14th January, to Lefroy you referred to the of the Sultan of Muscat to have a thorough oil survey carried out in his State, and enquired if the A«I.O»C» or P.C«L« were intending to open negotiations with the Sultan in the near future. In my letter of the 30th January I have given an undertaking on behalf cu to accept in respect of all the proposed concessions conditions similar oo Pnose accepted by the A«I«0«J« in respect of Qatar, with the sole reservation that P.J.L. should not be required to erect a separate refinery in each oi the areas over which it may obtain a concession. The points raised in your letter P.Z.759/36, dated the 4th February aiiect neither Bahrain nor Muscat. In the circumstances if I could have an early decision not only in respect of Bahrain (as promised in your let-cer ox the 5th ...arch), but also in respect of Muscat, I could telegraphto Major Holmes and tell him to negotiate a concession with the Shaikh of Bahrain, and thereafter proceed to Muscat to fix up the Muscat concession, and then proceed to Aden to consult Colonel Lake with a view to negotiating a concession with the Imam of Yemen, That would leave Kuwait and the Trucial Coast areas to be dealt with next season, but would at least ensure that the present season would not have been altogether wasted. I should add that the option obtained by the A-I-O.C. over Ras-al- Khaimah expires on the Slst' July, 1937, and that over Dubai on the 13th October, 1937, so we shall find ourselves with only one working season in which to send geological survey parties to these areas and to negotiate long-term concessions, but I suppose that that cannot be helped. Yours sincerely. * J.C* Walton Esq., C.B., M.C., India Office, Whitehall, S.W. 1.TELEPHONE : NATIONAL 3S82 TELEGRAMS : CODfco . i,- - BENTLEY’S SECOND PHRASE BENTLEY’S COMPLETE PHRASE WITH OIL SUPPLEMENT INLAND : PETCONCESS, FINSQUARE, LONDON FOREIGN : PETCONCESS, LONDON LOMBARD / kH« PETROLEUM CONCESSIONS LIMITED CITY-GATE HOUSE FINSBURY Sir , G.C.M.G.

Holmes had been instructed to notify the Sultan of Muscat that he would be calling on him on behalf of this Company to discuss an oil concession. I now enclose six copies of a draft concession with the Sultan, which follows very closely the wording of the other concessions, which were forwarded with my letter of the 30th January. The draft refers to the Sultan of Oman. I gather from Aitchison’s Treaties Yol.XI that this Sultanate is variously referred to as Muscat, as Oman, as Oman (Muscat) and as Muscat and Oman. I should be glad to know if H.M.Gr. have any preference in the matter. Yours faithfully.
