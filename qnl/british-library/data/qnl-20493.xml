At the same time there is no doubt that the general line of the arguments used, does carry weight with him and as a result of my conversations with him and with members of his staff 1 have become convinced that the more we keep the British G-ov^rnment and its representatives out of our negotiations with him, the better it will be for us; and I have contriv ed to do so as far as possible. He realises that Grovemment holds a very big share in trie capital of the A ,P ,O .G. and a predominat ing voice on its Board of Directors and he is rather nervous of us on that acouont. He is obviously impressed, too, by what he has seen in certain Egyptian newspapers regarding 'Iraq and the statement that the .P.C.C, control the Br5tish Oove mment T s policy there, though I have gone to a great deal to assure him that there is no truth whatever in such statements. It migbt interest Government to know that the only payers that T Xbn baud gets are the Egyptian papers al Ah rain snl al ^kbor, both of which are strongly anti-British and the Times of Mesopotamia whose Arabic page is worthless and the English of which cannot be mad owing to his having no one who knows English, Yours nine erely , (SIgne d) J, 13 ,Mackie He also P .S, The last para I now find is not accurate, SscicsCT gets the more moderate Egyptian papers.r- J ' D.O.

He replied that he Intended to arply to you for approval, but you informed him that you were 'all out against him'. Seeing that you were not neutral as he had expected, he prepared a report to his directors, who will have approached Govt, in London.

I am highly grateful for the sincere feelings of friendliness expressed 'by your Honour towards this friend; and it goes without saying that the same was considered by us as a measure of the high-mindedness and 1 audahle virtaies which characterize you. Your deputy, Mr Maclcie,arrived at our place, al- Hasa and delivered t o us the draft of the agreement relat ing to exploiation for oilin our territories, w© conferred with him and explained to him that it was difficult for us to accept terms differing from those contained in the agree ment (submitted by )2{olittes 9 because the latter had been submitted to an assembly consisting of the tJl ema Notables formed under the presidency of our father,the imam# It was beyond the power of this friend to countermand what is confirmed by this assembly* I called upon your deputy, therefore, to refer to your Honour on the subject, and I agreed to negotiate with him if you accepted the terms of the Holmes agreement as the basis for negotiation. I deeply regret t however,that I received a letter from mr Mackie, stating that your Honour have not agreed to this, and that he would take leave and abandon his request. In view of this circumstance, it inly remains for this friend to state to you definitely that he does,firstly, appreciate the important position you hold,and that he does, secondly, know full well the enterprise and power and the ability of your company to workf For this reason, I was really sorry to see that you broke the negotiation at the outset. You may rest assured that,had the question not been submitted to the assembly of the ulema and the IT otable^ ^ I would have endeavoured to afford you satisfaction as .I as possible and in any manner . seeing that it has gone out of this friend's purview, I think that you will excuse me if I demanded what I asked for as ahove.

The time was not yet rip© for the aamiesion of forei^m influenoe into the less civilised parte of hif? realm, mat is the attitude which he always adopts when he is in a tifht corner, namely that of a Sultan having but little hold over a fanatical crowd of savages who frequently get out of hand. As a inetter of fact, however, he has the Ikhwan completely under his control aM it is only in the more enlightened tmvns that he has any difficulty in enforcing his authority, T explained to him that that need not stand in the way of our negotiations, I could not, on my own authoruty, accept the confinement of the conceesionto the Hasa proTince only 'but I would refer the matter to you and I had no douht thst, considering the circumstances, you would a/rree . l^hen it was that he produced the argument which he afterwards used to block any suggestion which did not suit his views; a nd regarding the validity of which I have made carefiil enquiries without, however, obtaining any very delinite result. He claims that he is not a free agent in such matters as this but is hound by a Cotincil of Ulame in Hiyadh under the presidency of his father. One evening when I had called on him and found him alone, without even any of his confidential secretaries, he professed to e^lain to me the position of this oounctl and how it came into existence. 'Tou will understand' he said 'that I do not belong to the senior branch of the Ssud family, and so, in the ordinary course of events should not have attained to my present positio The senior representative of the senior branch is one Saud who now lives with me, but who, a few years ago raised the standard; of revolt in the Southern provinces with a view to getting for himself the position which I now hola ,, f Ibn Saun, having crushed the revolt thought it advisable to come to terms with his opponents and consented to the formation of a council of tJlsma under the presidency of his father to whoSn all important questions should be referred, he being left consi-erable freedom of action in gen- ral matters but being merely the council 1 s executive officer as regards matters which have been referred to it. He professes to be very 'Jixious regarding the security of his position and very afraid lest he may give his opponents a loophole for getting in a telling blow on him. How far that this claim that the council is a powerful body hose viev/s he dares not oppose is true, or how far it is merely a xoil to be used when he wants to block proposals made to him, I was unable to discover very clearly. Thero seems to be some difference of opinion about it, at any rate nmong the people of Hasa. It is certain that the council exists and that the Eastern and '-'onsral Syndicated draft was shown to its members before any reply wis given about it, but there are some grounds for the belief that it is VIbn Saud f s servant much more than his master♦ The preeldenoy of the council can easily be made by a masterful individual, a position of paramount importance in the state and in the course of a conversation oiie evening, f Ibn Saud gave me a very broad hint that when his father dies he may hiroself appoint one of his son's Sultan and himself become Imm t am of the Ikhwan and president ofthe council, a position which would give him immense power and authority while at the same time allowing him to disclaim all responsibility whenever he found it convenient to do so. Be that as it may, however, it was this claim of his which finally blocked my negotiations with him.

I had already understood from A.T. that the position was much what Mackie describes . But I do not think Bahrain, which regards the A.P.O.C. with such suspicion, can have much reason to complain. An oil concession will work both ways , will enormously increase cost of living, high already, will raise wages and so embarrass pearlers (nakhodas and others) so l am not sorry to see that we hasten slowly in the matter of oil. No one knows to start with if oil is there and in any case it ' 1 won't run away. Bahrain has plenty of money for immediate needs I liked, at first sight, your despatch re finances and sent it on with the shortest ot, covering letters , of which a copy will go to you.

We gave it after Bin Saud had already given concession during negotiations during which Cox was present and which was not disapproved by Government. I am aware that His Majesty's Government are in position to forbid con cession if they so intend but I am sure -that Justice of Gov ernment will not allow them to forbid to my Government what has been permitted to Bin Saud without objection or , if not, they will allow me to deal with some other English Company. As regards terms of Abadan Company, they are not satislactory to me or to my subjects 1 . Ends. I asked him later reason for objections to / Anglo Persian Oil Company . He replied that Anglo ersian Oil Company very unpopular among Arabs and had been for years ( . mut. . . .) have given concessions be!ore but knew ol no other company. Anglo Persian Oil Company mixed up in polit ics and he would be extremely jxnpopular if he gave concession to them- 1 did all 1 could to persuade but it was evident I that they will not yield short of compulsion.

The Res id enoy, Bushire, 18th June 1923 v J liy dear Daly , .1 have Just received you3u telegram i |o. 78-C dated l6th June on the subject of oij oonoe^siona , Paiirain, 1 s.il endeavouring to get a letter myself to Sb&amp;lkh Hamad on this subject. 1 learn from Kuwait that Holmes is t leaving for England toy this slow mail and there will probably be considerable developments when he gets back to Europe and the Eastern and General Syndicate discover what a tangle they and Holmes have tied themselves up in. ^, i'. Wilson may or may not be correct when he says that it is quite impossible for the eastern and General Syndic ate to w^rK the concession whioli they navs ootaine^. from Pin Sa-jd without the aid ot the ^nglo Persian Oil Coffii.any. If ne is right 1 do not see whav possible benefit to Bin Saud or any body else there can result irom these negotiations • a II t^^is renders it imperative that Banrain should be extremely cautious before committing themselves in aiiy direction. In my original dral t 1 directed Hamac to ixiiorm r .olmes that tne concession was valueless as His Majesty's Government would not consent to it ■ and txj&amp;re ia not the least doubt that i^olm^s knew perfectly well, and so did his principals , that their proper path lay through the Colonial Department of His majesty 's Government and they can have no reasonable ground of complaint whatever if they find that His Majesty's Servants are up against them. Cl course 1 cannot explain on my present information the conduct of Sir Percy Cox. He is big enough to detend himself and it seems obvious that he must have had sojrces oi L:i 1 o^Tuation whic.i are not available to me# But then, on this supposition f 1 arr. entirely at a loss to explain w]ny the Secretary of State for the Colonies has let Cox down. In regaiti to Bahrain the position is abaolutely clear, as I am explaining in my letter . They have promised not ^o e nter m I4? #ater into aegotiationa with any person not approved by Hia majesty's Gcveiment and they had no right to rcake any assunipt- ^ ion from what took ^laoe at Riyadh that ths aame person tisat tte^ would be approved in Bahrain. You oan alao toll Eacad that there are .excellent reaaona which you are not allowed to disclOiae at present why HOlmea and the Eastern and General Syndicate do not auit Bahrain. xlo one wants to force Bahrain into parting with its oil to the .angle r; er!?ian Oil Com- j.any or anybody eli3«?, but. there ia a EiO^v dangerous Jpr Qj. oadi in Hamad * b letter, as. reported by you in the telegram under consideration . viz., th»t dovernK.ent will allow him to deal' with some other English company • 11' that means tnat Hamad i^ to rvtsh into the market and entangle himselt with any rascally speculator who may precent nimsellT , 1 oan conceive nu co ai '&amp;e of conduct that could be more distasteful to the British Gov ernment or more dangerous to himsielf . Tne oil will not run away and wne concession is quite likely to be a more valuable matter to the Shaikh fiv^ years hence, say, than it is now. Why hwry ? Yours sincerely , l P.3. You might ask Hamad how doe^ he know that the con cession granted by Bin tfaud is not objected to by His Majesty 1 -* Government. ? 7hey would not be likely to tell him no if it *ra and even Sir Percy Cox may make mistakes . fo iaajor C. k. A&gt;aly, - Political Agent, Bahrain.Si MI1TUTE of a meeting 'between sir A«T # Wildon t and Shaikh Ahmad al-jalDer as-sabahfEuler of- Kuwait,on the 2nd June 1923# Sir A.T.Wilson asked the shaikh if he had had time to peruse the draft of proposed agreement between the Shaikh and the D^A^cy Exploration co and to offer such re- mars as he may have • The shaikh replied in the affimative,adding that he will have to make many observations and suggestions for modifications. He pointed out that,seeing that the agree ment affected the vital interests of his country and of its people,it would be unfair for him to expedite the con clusion thereof without due consideration and consultation. He would,on the other hand t be doing an injustice to the Company if he rejected any of their proposals off-hand . Furthermore, he would be guilty of telling the company an untruth if he promised to undertake anything which was beyond his power to perform • •» This affair is of a com mercial nature', he went on to say, «and it needs consider- able deliberation in order that full justice may be done to both parties •• Sir A ,T.Wilo »n stated that,in view of his friendsht for the shaikh-and his loyalty to His Majesty^ Govern ment ,he would in no wise attempt to force the shaikh's hands by bringing the least pressure to bear upon him ,aiid that the latter could consider the agreement with due care# Colonel KJaox had already wired for a ship for his voyage and intended leaving Kuwait on Monday night after dining at the shaikh's Palace; and sir a .T.Wilson would prolong his stay at Kuwait till Thursday and leave the place by the slow Mail if the Shaikh was inclined to think that it would be possible for him to discuss the terms by that time . if the shaikh did not think so t however f sir2« b&gt; A«T # Wilson would leave Kuwait in company with the Political Resident. The shaikh answered that .while he wished to settle the matter with all possible speed t he would beg of six Arnold not to urge upon him to hasten a decision • « I wiO. not msOce any contract with any company except the one * presided over by you , and of this you may rest assured'. He added that there were many modifications for him to sug gest;that he would read one article of the agreement after another 0 suggest such alterations as may be required by uhe interests of his country and submit such new articles as he may deem fit • Sir A.T.Wilson inquired if the shaikh could think of discussing any of the articles in this meeting, so that those provisions on which both parties agreed may be known and those over which they disagreed may be reserv ed for future discussion • y The Shaikh rejoined by saying X/ that it would surel take sometime to do so and that he would request for an ample respite to deliberate on the different points. ••But I tell you* » he remarked, 'that I shall not enter into an agreement with any other company without your informa tion .« ** Sir a .T.Wilson asked the Shaikh if this assurance could begiven to him in writing . The sbaikh replied to this 1 give you my word of honour that I will not conclude any contract with any Company witnout informing you,at first,of the terms suggested by them • This word I give you in view of the friendship and regard I entertain for you personally,as I have regarded you as my father or even more. * ■*** ~0000- - While thanking the shaikh for the above assurance, A»T,Wilson reiterated his remark with reference to his departure f and stated that his purpose in inviting the Shaikh to discuss such of the terms as he could was to avoid a further visit by him to Kuwait,as he f sir Wilson,had to proceed to iiaghad and perhaps to Teheran and that he did not presume that it would 'be convenient for him to visit Kuwait again • The Shaikh observed that he was aware of the fact that sir Wilson was very busor with important matters # but that the shaikh himself would be visiting .Basrah in a few days,say a fortnight,and would take an opportunity of discussing thematter with sir Wilson there,failing which he would no doubt refer to the representative of the Government at Kuwait • 'But you should not have the least doubt,* he added, 'that I will not enter into any agree ment whatever with any company except the one of which you are the head,without informing you beforehand. •» (0) Sir Wilson explained to the shaikh the addition made by him to article 10 of the proposed agreement • The Shaikh appeared to 'be pleased with the same and observed that it was useful for him • He repeated to sirA.T.^ilson his intention of visiting Basrah and meeting sir Wilson at Mohammareh, but he emphasised again that it was not advisable to discuss the conditions of the agreement without due meditation on his part.4 s-b I was invited to tea by Hamad Ai dull ah aa-sagar this afternoon • i; e observed, in the course of oonveraation, that it was now deaitely settled by the jhai h that the 'other company' will not be granted the oil conces sion tor which they had aslced , and that the shaiJch had stated ,j his friends that he would seriously consi der tne draft agreement submitted by the a 'Arcy &lt;30. Hamad observed,howerer, that it was necessary for us to treat the jhaikh with all possible patience -jnd care, for »he was like a wild bird, which could not be tamed at once «. The shaikh oonaidered, according to Hamad , that 30 ie of the conditions put forward by the D'Arcy co were too onerous on him . but he was generally inclined to favour that company and appeared to have resolved to reject theoffer made by the Eastern Generi Syndicate . Hamad supposed that the beat tine to deal with Shaikh Ahmad and to induce him,effectually, to sign the agreement with the DUroy Uo was when the Shaikh -visited MOhaaunareh and that the assistance of shaikh Khasaal may be enlisted for thepurpose of conrincing shaikh /dim ad that it would be to his interest if he concluded the agreement we had proposed to him . Hamad referred to the .haikh'3 ill-feelings against S-rick soott aid co, -and 1 explained to him that that firm was no longer the Managing Agents of the P.

Great britsin. we have always been identified with the spirit of cordiality which has become an established creea |or us and has caused us to accent the private views of British statesmen on account of the zeal -we have- noticed in them for the protection of our intarosta. we addressed that word,-S! s word/ to J&amp;Jor Holmes for the foregoing reason, namely that of acquainting ourselves with the nature (orig^ spirit) of that Syndioate.

I enclose herewith, in original and with translation, a letter dated the 23rd instant from Shaikh Ahmad on the subject of a draft oil concession, which he has been discussing* with Major Holmes, and which he is most anxious to grant to the Eastern and General Syndicate, Ltd, I have informed the Shaikh in reply that I am forwarding his letter to you, and have reminded him of the written undertaking, given 'by the late Shaikh Mubarak in his letter dated the 27th ■ October i£l3, and of the fact which you pointed out to him on the occasion of your recent visit that neither Major Holmes nor the syndicate which he represents are in any way 'appointed from the British Government', adding that,in view of the very definite promises which he made to ^ir Arnold Wilson and to you at the beginning of the month, X felt it was quite unnecessary to say any more, I discussed the matter with him verbally on the evening of the 22nd instant, and he definitely promised that he would not sign any agreement in the mean time, and no agreement has actually been signed ae yet, but i^ajor Holmes' representative is still in - Kuwait with the draft agreement all ready for signature on receiotI of what the Shaikh would consider a satisfactory answer from you. I understand that the success of Major Holmes' negotiations was manoeuvred chiefly by Shaikh Yusuf, head-master of the | Madrasat al-Ahmadiyah, and Khan Bahadur iiulla iiallh, who were both tireless in their efforts to persuade the Shaikh, to grant him the concession. If stories which I hear now are true. Major Holmes Oil concessions f.a. hg) 75 himself appears to be gifted with a most vivid imagination and to 'be 'but little hampered by a conscience. One of the chief arguments he is reported to have used was that now that Ibn Sa'ud has granted a concession to his syndicate it is obviously wisest for Shaikh Ahmad to grant one too, as otherwise 'they could draw away all oil from Kuwait territory without going there at all, in the same way that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company draw away oil from the neighbourhood, of Mosul 1 He is said to have agreed at once to whatever of His Majesty's G-overnment not approving of the proposed - I agreement, as this was a question which would be settled in London and it was only the local Political officers who were trying to boom* the Anglo-Persian Oil Company for reasons of personal friendship, euc # , and that they would go back on what they had said when taxed with it from London, as Sir Percy Cox had done in the case of Ibn ^a'ud^ I must say that from what I have seen of Major Holmes personally, I am surprised if these stories are true as I Judged him in my ov^n mind to be a thoroughly honest and straightforward man I learn that Shaikh Ahmad's proposal to grant a concession to the Eastern and G-eneral Syndicate, Ltd., in preference to the d'Arcy Exploration Company, Ltd., is not looked upon with favour by the majority of the leading merchants and other influential men in the town, and that, at a ma.1 lis summoned to discuss the the question on the ^2nd instant, some remarkably plain speaking was indulged in, notably by Shaikh Jabir as~Subah and Hamad al- Khalid. Shaikh Ahmad is a man of no strength of character, and X do m not think it is at all likely that he will try and take his own way in opposition to both public opinion and your advice, if as X presume will be the case, you still advise iiim to deal only mitli the d'Arcy Exploration Company, Ltd.Translation of a letter, dated the Sth Phul ^a'dah i34- ( ^3rd June 1V23 ), from H.K.

I 'beg to inform you that Major Frank Holmes, the accredited agent of the Eastern and General Syndicate, Ltd., has come uo —Kuwait and has su&amp;aivted &amp; to me a draft concession for mineral oil in Kuwait, territory, which, on careful consideration, I find to be beneficient and profitable. What I particularly like about I it is that it is a British company and that it undertakes not to sell the concession to any but British companies. In addition to this, I purpose inserting a clause to the effect that this con cession will only come into force if approved by His Majesty's Crovernment, and that if Grovernment do not approve it it becomes nu^I and void* I feel confident that if I grant this concession to the Company in question. His Majesty's Government will raise no objection, as my friend Shaikh 'Abdul 'Aziz Sultan of Kajd has granted them a similar concession and H•£. Sir Percy Cox who was present at the time raised no objection, and as my friend jfesx the Ruler of Bahrain has given them a similar con cession and there was no objection to this either. I hope there fore from the justice of Government that this also be approved, Usual ending. f wFIU8HIRE RE8IDEN0Y. ^ ^ 7 JLL Political ii^ency, Kuwait, th June i9S3, To ooMFicfcsiu. ^ccm imwttiiiihmfii'ii iviitimwrrirrrrf^ttr ^^''^'1 The Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, B U a H I R K. \ \fu ■ Oil concessions. p.s jt • ^ ' - / In continua'tion of my niemorandum No,97 w 5 of 25th June 1923, Shaikh Ahmad sent word that he wished to call on me this afternoon ? and, shortly 'before the appointed hour, sent me a further letter on the subject of the oil concession which he purposes g^rcviiting, to the Eastern and General Syndicate, Ltd, ? which X enclose hereY&gt; T ith in original and with translation.

His Majesty's G-overnment have no hold on either the man himself or on his Company ard can in no way bring pressure to bear on him to act honestly and rightly, it is therefore not in the least surprising that both your Highness and the Shaikhs of Bahrain and Kuwait should have found Major Holmes much more amenable and complaisant and desirous to promise all that Your Highness and these two Shaikhs may require of him, but it is not necessary for me to remind Your Highness, who is thoroughly well versed in affairs of this world , that it is a very long way from promise to performance ,and I think you will find it so in this case,, The Eastern and General Syndicate have no experience of working oil and it is quite likely that they will find it very unprofitable to attempt to look for oil and to exploit oil if found in Your Highness' dominions. They are at present considerably embarrassed by the under- taKing given by Major Holmes that they will not sell any part of their concession to the D'-t^rcy Exploration Company , whose local representative is Sir Arnold Wilson-, and I have been instructed i by His Majesty s Secretary of State for the Colonies to bring to the notice of Your Highness that the Eastern and General Syndicate 'inform me (i.e. Secretary of State) that they have no objection to3 f ^0 %, f* 3^ to the cancellation of the undertaking given by Holmes to Bin Saud that no part of the con cession would be sold to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company' , I would here point out in passing that as neither Kuwait, Bahrain and still less Your Highness' dominions are any .concern of Persia , it has been thought advisable to change the name of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company when working in Arabia, to the 'D'Arcy Exploration Company' , His iviajesty's Secretaiy of State for the Colonies expresses very strongly a hope that Your Highness will agree to the cancellat ion of this condition. There are various rumours afloat as to how this condition came to be inserted in the general agreement but I neither know nor do 1 desire to know at whose instance this condition was inserted . All that I can say on the sub ject is that it seems strongly inconsistent with the terms of Your Highness 1 letter dated the 17th of Ramzan 1341 to Sir Arnold Wilson , and it is therefore thsat 1 reject at once a very im probable rumour that it was Your Highness your- ^ self who insisted on the insertion of this clause and informed the envoy of the Eastern and Q -eneral Sjindicate that Your Highness would refuse to grant any concession at all unless 1 this undertaking was signed by the Syndicate's ^ envoy . In these circumstances I ask with some confidence that Your Highness will be so good as to agree to the cancellation of this clause in the agreement , as I have the word of the Eastern and General Syndicate that they do not object to its cancellation,and from the terms ot Your Highness' letter to Sir Arnold Wilson cited above,I take the liberty of doubting whether it is approved by Your Higimess . I WOUld4 would venture to press for the favour of a very (r early reply as Bis Majesty s Government nave expressed their interest in the matter , . , ■ perhaps it will add to your Highness' comprehension of this intricate matter if I venture to explain the reasons for the interest displaced by His Majesty's Government. • •. - U-. ♦ P^rom the point of view of such a * r i ■* * . i i j -v.. .&lt;~l cvl j xs- .o . c^ •• ... &gt; lai'ge subject as Oil exploration. and exploitation the field , even of Eastern Arabia , is a restricted one and there is not room for two British compan ies .

I am to enclose you, in confidence, copy of the cable received from 'ajor Holmes to-day, which Mr. Janson showed to Mr. Vernon, and to point out that the suggestions that this Syndicate has any intention of selling to a foreign company, or that the undertaking referrinr to the exclusion of the Anglo-Persian Company was suggested by our representative, are quite unfounded, and we venture to emphasise our right as a purely English Company, whose intention is to work jointly with the Anglo-Persian Company Limited if the undertaking given to the Sultan is cancelled, to the support of the Colonial Office.

Firstly, my dearv friend, you stated that I should inform iiajor Holmes aoout that concession. I do not consider it proper on ray part to cancel an agreement which I made ■/ithout any reason on the part of Major Holmes. As it has been stipulated in the agreement that it should be approved by the High British Government, undoubtedly the u-overnment is able to prevent Major Holmes if she wishes to do so. Secondly, you have remarked about the promise given by my rather to Major Trevor in his letter dated IHth Jamadi II, 13:52. y/o relied upon the condition laid down in the agreement that it would never be executed except by the approval of the High British government.

As you say , it is without doubt in the power of His Majesty's Government to inform the Eastern and General Syndicate that they do not intend to approve this concession and it is highly likely that they have already done so^ But what I am surprised to notice in yourseIt and others is that while you are scrupulously mindful to observe your promises to a man like Major Holmes , you appear to be very unmindful and neglectful of the promise ma^e by ^our respected father to the British Government. Let us look at the facts together Your father promised- he would not enter into negotiations regarding oil concessions- with anyone not approved by the British Government. And he has broken that promise and you and your brother Abdulla informed me confidentially that you were concerned in the negotiations ., and were therefore equally guilty in breaking the Bahrain promise in company with your respected 1 at her . No doubt this was done inadvertently but the fact remains that -tli® promise was brokon- I now ask you as an honest man to make the only reparation in your power and to inform Major Holmes that you regret that owing to % J9 to a previous promis^nade to the British Gov ernment^ which, tor the moment,you forgot, you must ask him to consider all these negotiations i. ny.ll and void . 11 you like to add that there was no fault on the part of Major Holmes , that is your affair . Of course I do not agree that there was no fault on the part of Major Holmes for if he had done what prudence would have ad vised any ordinary contractor to do vi^ , to consult the political Agent, Bahrain , who is entrusted with the affairs of British subjects in Bahrain, he would have learne-ti immediately that the Shaikh $f Bahrain was unable to treat on the subject of oil with any person not approved by His Majesty's G-overnment .huL Major Holmes knew perfectly well that he was not so approved , Therefore the whole of these negotiations was underhand and deceitful and all parties concerned must share the blame . I think on reconsideration Your Highness will agree that the part of an honest man, now that the facts are pointed out to him and that 1 no con cealment is longer possible, is to inform Major Holmes in the sense that I have desired . Whether you do so or not is largely a matter of indifference except so far as your own reputation and credit with His Majesty's Govern ment is concerned . If you value that respect and credit you will do as I advise, if you do not , I can only regret the inference which His Majesty's Government and their officers must draw from your conduct .

In these circumstances I am to reouest that His (Jrace may now be informed of the terms which your Company are prepared to offer for the grant of an exclusive prospecting license over the Sultan's territories'. Our^London Principals replied on the 17th of May that they were willing to accept a concession on the same terms as those approved by the Colonial Office for Zoweit and Bahrain, and ashed the Colonial Office to be good enough to instruct you by cable to endeavour to get the Sultan to sign such concession at once. On the following month the Sultan proceeded to Dhofar, and we understand that he is not likely to return to Mascat before the middle of Uovember. We understand that the Political Agent has since received through you instructions from His Majesty's G-overnment to give his assistance to the D'Arcy Exploration Company in Detaining a concession from the Sultan of Mascat on the same lines as at Howeit and Bahrain, and that the Sultan of Mascat has been informed in this sense.

Downing Street, September 1923» X ^3 I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of yoar Ciespatoh of the 20th June,No,299,transmitting the text of a vtrafu Agrssruent submitted to the Sheikh of Kuwait by Six Arnoxd Wilson on behalf of the D'Arcy Exploration Company and your despatches No,378 and 405 of the 13th and 24th of July on the same subject. Be tore commenting upon the provisions ol tiiis draft Agreement, I desire to explain in gome derail the attitude of T Iis Majesty's (rovernment towards this Concession and towards the question of the grant of Oil Concessions on the Arabian Littoral of the Persian Gulf in general. For this purpose it will be convenient to review briefly the circumstances which have led up to the present situation. In this despatch I do not propose to deal with tne question of the Nejd Concession, since this will form the subject of a separate despatch. - 2 e -As you .are aware, His Majesty's Government as part of a considered policy have obtained from the Sheikhs of Kuwait and Bahrein and from other native rulers in the Peisian Gulf, formal undertakings to the effect that they will not grant any go^essioas for the development of Oil in their territorial-to any person, or persons, not approved ('appointed') oy His Majesty's Government. The object of f THE ACTING RESIDENT IN THE- PERSIAN GULF. obtaining l v v -L - A &gt;s IU C ! 15) obtaixiing these undertakings was two-fold. In the first place it was intended thereby to protect the rulers themselves against the pernicious activities of unscrupulous Concession hunters of the type which preyed so successfully upon the Turkish Empire before the war, and secondly it was desired by this means to restrict the grant of Concessions to reputable British finns,and thus to prevent the infiltration of foreign influence in the Persian Gulf .which was regarded as politically undesirable, 3, In order to avoid advantage being taken of the native rulers 1 inexperience in such matters, it was laid down thaw applicants for Concessions should not negotiate direct '^ v Sheikhs, out should, in the first instance seek His Majesty's Government 1 s permission to apply for a Concession upon approved lines,and,having obtained such permission and agreed upon terms which His Majesty^ Govemment would be prepared to recommend to the Sheikhs as acceptable 9 should then open negotiations either through the Political Resident oi tiirou^i the medium of the Political Agent concerned^ 4. In the summer of 1921 the Anglo-Persian Oil Company expressed a desire to secure a series of exclusive prospecting licenses for Oil over the whole Arabian Littoral of the Persian Gulf, The Company's proposal was referred to this Department by the India Office and, as my predecessor * ■ : ■ ■ - - • was satisfied that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company were in a position to undertake and carry out satisfactorily the development of the oil resources of that area,the proposal was accepted in principle. After considerable correspondence and negotiation the main heads of an Agreement covering exploratory and prospecting rights in the territories of Bahrein and Kuwait uere drawn up in agreement with the Company by the interested Departments of His Majesty's Government, and « J I'M i' i I b m hand were coamunicated to the Political Resident for sutmission to the Sheikhs concerned. These draft heads of Agreement, which were adapted from the usual Colonial Model, vox^ so framed as to provide the nucleus of an Agreement, f/hich would, in my opinion, have been in every way favourable to the interests ot the Sheikhs, in that they were designed not only to provide for the expeditious and systematic development of the oil resources of their territories,but also to produce for the Sheikhs very handsome royaltiese 5* However, before any agreement could be concluded Major Holmes, avowedly, and probably actually, in ignorance of the necesity for obtaining the prior pennission of His Majesty 1 s Government,approached the Sheikhs of Kuwait and Bahrein dir ect and succeeded in inducing them to grant or undertake to grant to the Eastern and Greneral Syndicate^ which he represented, exclusive Concessions for the exploitattion of oil and other minerals in their territories. These concessions contain several^unsatisfactory features (notably the provision whereby the Sheikhs would receive a percentage of the shares of the exploitation Company, in tne place of a definite royalty based upon output) and they would in any case require to be substantially modified before I should feel justified in advising the Sheikhs to accept them. But quite apart fran this consideration, I felt very strongly that the Sheikhs should not be allowed to disregard their solemn undertaking with impunity, nor that '♦unapproved' firms, by approaching them direct, should be permitted to secure Concessions the terms of which had not previously been submitted to His Majesty 1 © Government; particularly in view of the fact that the Anglo(Lk&gt; An^Lo-Persian Oil Company would thereby have directly suffered as a result of having carefully observed all the conditions required by His Majesty's Government^ /' { I A telegTi-ain was therefore sent to Colonel Trevor on the 30th June instructing him to inform the Sheikhs that His Majesty's Government would not approve of the Concessions which contrary to their undertakings they had granted to Major Holmes, and that the Eastern and General Syndicate was not a firm approved by His Majesty's Government. 7. By this latter statement it must not be understood that my intention was to give the impression that His Majesty's Government had any objection in principle to the ^astern and General Syndicate except on the grounds of th% irregular manner in which their Concessions had been obtained On the contrary, so far as His Majesty's Government are aware the Eastern and General Syndicate although possessing neither the wide experience of oil production nor the efficient organization and financial strength of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company are a substantial and reputable firm. 3. In view of the attitude taken up by His Majesty's Government the Eastern and General Syndicate have now volunteered to modify their Concessions in such manner as to confona to the wishes of His Majesty's Government, These Concessions have not yet been closely examined in the Colonial Office but if in fact the Syndicate show themselves willing to accept such suggested modifications as may upon examination prove to be necessary,and moreoverare able to satisfy me that they are in a position and intend to carry out to the full the obligations which they propose to undertake towards the Sheikhs, I shall no longer, subject to my remarks in the following paragraph, feel any strong objection to their candidature, 9, On the other hand, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company both by their priority of application and by their due observance of the correct procedure,have in my opinion established an undoubted claim to His Majesty's Government's prior support, provided, of course, that they are prepared to offer to the Sheikhs terms at least as favourable as those submitted by the Eastern and General Syndicate. Consequently I am not prepared to recognize the Concessions granted to the latter Company unless and until the Sheikh of Kuwait has set forth his objections to the draft Agreement submitted to him by Sir Arnold Wilson: has explained his statement ( reported in the telegram of the 13th July from the Political Agent, Kuwait, a copy of which accompanied your despatch of the 30th July No.378) that the draft Agreement, is entirely unacceptable to himself and his people: has satisfied me of the validity of those objections: and has further stated precisely in what manner he wishes that Agreement modified. 10. If when this information has been obtained from the Sheikh , his proposals are notnot accepted by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company I shall then he prepared to approve of the Kuwait Concession being granted to the Eastern and General Syndicate, provided that the terms thereof are no more favourable to the Company than those rejected by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, and that the Concession is recast upon approved lines. 11. You should therefore communicate to the Sheikh the revised draft agreement contained in the later paragraphs of this despatch and inforai him that His Majesty's Government consider it a fair basis for discussion with the Company. You should also call upon him to formulate his objections if any to this revised draft Agreement, and to state in the clearest terms in what way he proposes that it should be modified. The Sheikhas proposals should then be communicated to me and also to the local representative of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, who would then decide, in consultation with his principals, to ¥/hat extent these proposals may be accepted. I am also prepared, provided the alterations proposed do not involve any large question of principle, and provided that they are acceptable to the Company to authorize you at your own discretion to approve on behalf of His Majesty's Government the grant of the concession by the Sheikh without further reference to myself. In dealing with this matter you should proceed in consultation with the local representatives of the Company as proposed in the. last paragraph of your despatch No.4051^4- i f'7 of the 24th of July. 12. The procedure which Ihave set out above as regards Kuwait, should also 'be followed, mutatis mutandis with regard to Bahrein. You should proceed as you propose in your despatch No. 406 of the 24th of July and, when you think that the time is ripe for further action, the Sheikh should he informed that His Majesty's Government have not found it possible, in view of the prior claims of the D'Arcy Exploration Company, to approve the concession granted by the Sheikh, contrary to Ms predecessor's solemn undertaking, to the Eastern and General Syndicate, and that they desire him first of all to consider the application of the former Company, In the event however of the Company net being prepared to offer the Sheikh terms which are as favourable in the opinion of the Sheikh himself and oi His Majesty's Government as those offered by the Syndicate, His Majesty's Government are prepared to withdraw their opposition to the grant of a concession to the latter. 13. I will now proceed to examine the Anglo- Persian Oil Company's draft agreement, the form of which in my opinion, leaves much to be desired. I fully sympathise with the Company's desire to regularize their position once and for all, which has led them to provide in one agreement for the grant of exploration and prospecting licenses and a mining lease, but their draft has in consequence lost in precision and clarity, and appears to charge the Sheikh with large and ill-defined liabilities over a long period of years. This is illustrated by the wording of Article 1, which at present gives the impression that thethe exploration license is to remain inforce for a period of 60 years. This is presumably not the intention, and in any case directly conflicts with Article 2. I should therefore not find it possible to inform the Sheikh that I am satisfied that his rights and interests would he adequately guarded by the existing draft agreement. The Company can, however, attain their object equally well, and without imparting ambiguity into the agreement, by adopting the expedient of framing an agree ment which provides for the grant of exploration and pros pecting rights, and also irrevocably binds the Sheikh - subject to the fulfilment of certain specified conditions - to grant at the request of the Company (on or before the teraination of the prospecting period) a mining lease upon terms set forth in detail in a document scheduled to the agreement. The advantage of this method, which is generally employed in similar cases in the Colonies, is that it defines witnout ambiguity the exact relations between the two parties in all the various stages; moreover it is by this arrange ment open to uhe Company at the expiry of the prospiecting period either to withdraw from the whole undertaking without incurring any obligations in respect of exploitation, or, if oil is discovered in profitable quantities, to obtain a mining lease upon previously agreed terms. 14. This view should be represented to the Local Representative of the Company, and he should be piessed to substitute for the present draft agreement a revised draft modified on the following lines. He should be informed that if the Agreement is revisedrevised in this way I shall have no hesitation in commending it to the Sheikh. Article I * should read 'The Sheikh grants to the Company by these presents an exclusive exploration licence for a period of two years from the date of this agreement, whereby the Company shall be entitled to search for natural gas, petroleum, asphalte and ozokerite throughout the whole extent of the territories under his control and to enjoy the privileges set out in the first schedule to this agree ment; and he undertakes on behalf of hiiself and his successors to grant to the Company the further exclusive licences and privileges set forth below,' A rticle II The Exploration licence referred to in the preceding Article may be extended for a further period of two years and so on as in the existing Article II. A rticle III The Sheikh hereby undertakes on behalf of himself and his successors to grant to the Company on application after the expiry of the above mentioned period and so on as in existing Article III. Add at the end;- 'Under the terms of this licence the Company shall enjoy the privileges set out in the ■ o ' second schedule to this agreement'. Article IV . The Sheikh hereby undertakes on behalf of himself and his successors to grant to the Company on the expiration of the prospecting licence a Mining Lease over an aggregate area not exceeding 100,000 acres divided into not more than three blocks on the terms and in the form of the Lease attached as the third schedule to this Agreement. Article V.ib~7 I bbi Article V. First sentence as first sentence of Article XIV.

Sir, I am directed 'by the ihike of Devonshire to inform you that he has recently been in c o m?nnnicat ion with the Political Resi dent in the Persian Gulf on the subject of the development of the oil resources of ICtlwait and Bahrein and has received from that officer a copy of the text of the draft concession submit ted to the SheiXh of lixiwait by Jir a . i 1 . • ilson on your behalf. 2. His Grace has recently sent the Resident a general state ment of His Majesty r s Governments policy in these matters and instructions for his future guidance and thinks it will be con venient to you to know the substance 01 chese instructions. j. His Grace began by pointing oat that His Majesty's Govern ment nave had two main objects in view; in the first place they wished to protect the Sheikh against exploitation by unscrupulous concession-hunters and in the second place they wished to prevent foreign commercial interests from penetrating into the Persiaa Gulf. He recalled the fact that with this end in view His Mahesty's Government have concluded agreements with the various rulers of these territories by which the rulers nave bound themselves not to entertain proposals for the exploitation of oil except through His Majesty's Government and he recorded that it was laid down*that applicants for concessions should not negotiate direct with the Sheikhs, but should in the first instance seek Bis Majesty's Government's permission to apply, and on receiving such permission, should open the negotiations through the Political Resident or the Political Agent concerned. 4. He then stated that your Company had approached this De- oartment some two years ago with a view to obtaining rights in these territories and that negotiations had been proceeding for some time and bad almost concluded when Major Holmes arrived in the Persian Gulf and approached various rulers and obtained either actual concessions or promises to grant concessions from certain of them. THE SECRETARY, AUGL 0 - P SH 31A E' OIL COMPANY, LTD.c a s 57 COPY. ^ r i'p &gt; S- - ( 2 ) - Be recalled the fact that he had then instructed the .^■ident to inform the 3heikhs of Kuwait and Bahre- n, v ao v. ere among the rulers referred to, that in view of .he procednre by which these concessions had been obtained the^ would not be approved by His Majesty's Government. 6 He informed the Resident that the decision to withhold ap or oval had been taken in view of the fact tnat y^ a1 ' . had adopted the proper procedure in approaching tais department n • . x. ^ v./l 4' ■ ■'r V a mtj « rmt ; • T &gt; f&gt;T). c !, IT. Ci to allow it to allow whe th er in the first instance and tLat he was not propa}\:c» to suffer by reason of the fact that Major nolmes, ^ deliberately or In ignorance of the prescribed procecrare, nad vnV-oached the rulers direct, but he made it clear that the oblection was not based on the character of the 3yndicate which was both substantial and reputable though not possessing the wider experience of oil production or efficient organisa tion of your Company. 7. He went an to say that the ^lulicete had now icr^araed copied of thoir ooEoaSaiou.. to this .ae^artiaent anct_n8d expiessed their rsadinaea to make Bueh no-- inioationb as 1.9 f&gt;ar.»u a.j.ect t and he stated that if they Implwtouiecl this ^ndariinj wia satisfied hfm of their ability to oarry out t.ie ol ) .Js«cj .on&amp; impo aad upon them by their oopacasalonG, ho ba 8.^ to* raise objection to their candidature proyxdea your_ company was i;iven the priority of opportunity to ^hxoh ifca pn.oi Bp .1-i c a t i on en t i 11 e d it. 8. He therefore instructed the He si dent to info im i-ne -'heiid:* of -ruwait that the Secretary of State was not prepares to arc rove the concession granted by the Sheikh to the '-Kast era and General Syndicate until that ruler had statea m precise te^ms l-ho Obi eotions. which he had informed Sir A.T. wuam that he had to the draft cunosaaion submitted on behalf of your Company ana hed aatisfiod the resident that these oh j ac A otk . wex e v-^d and had also famiulated on his own behalr conn.or-prop j »1 s regarding the form of the ooneesslon. Pis Grace addea tuSo if these counter-proposals when fornulatea were 1101 accepted bv vour Company he would withdraw his objection bo the of a oonceaaion to the Eastorn and Ueneral oyndicate provided its terras were not more favourable to the Company than the terms refused by your C ompany and provided that the concession was modified in certain par lieulais. q in the first instance therefore His Grace instructed the Resident to coramunicata to your local repreeentaUTe the revised text of the draft concessian submUbea bj, tae ia^er and, provided he agreed, to set it before the biiei^h and oall upon that ruler to formulate his oojeotlons, if any, i-a the_ revised draft.

October, 1923. . / ' , ' .(A'*' ■ y, . K. la ■&gt;» /»/ th: • • I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of /our despatch No.367 S. of the 17th of (which is jjiesumciol^/ a clerical ■-rror for July, as the despatch did iiOw i.eo..Cix uiis Office until the 13th August) forwarding a draiu 01 a letter to be addressed to rii.s Highness the SuUan of Nejd regarding the question of oil development in his territories, I addressed you at some^ength in ray despatch ^0,9 of the 6th of September on the^enersl raestion of oil development in the territories adjacent to the Persian Gu lf and the general principles set out in that despatch C ''PP J ' G T aaj -ly i n the case of Nejd, except that in view of tne status of that territory His Majesty's Government cannot claim to exercise the same measure of control as in case of territories such as Kuwait. 3. Since despatching to you my telegram of the loth --uly I have reconsidered the whole situation and am now of opinion that it is not desirable that you should taiie caiy ^action which might have the effect of causing the Sultan to cancel the concession granted by him to the -astern and General Syndicate. Such a step would not promote the general interests of British commerce in the Persian Gulf and might have undesirable effects in other 0 * J ' UJ ' VQ informed that the Eastern and General Syndicate h POLITICAL RESIDENT in the pshsiail gulf, BUSHIRE.Syndicate are at present engaged in negotiations with another. Company for working the Nejd concession, ana if this information is correct andjbhe negotiations are successful the question of co-operation with the d'Arcy Exploration Company may not be a matter of immediate importance; but, in any case, I consider that a convenient opportuni ty should betaken to induce the Sultan, to cancel his embargo upon co-operation of the 13 f Arcy Exploration Company in the concession. 4. As you will have understood from my despatch referred to above I am now/satisfied that it is either possible or desirable to maintain so strong a line of resistance to the claims of the Eastern and General Syndicate as I was at first inclined to adopt, and some information has reached me which suggests that Major Holmes has not in fact overstepped the bounds of legitimate commercial competition. I. ore over the position of His Majesty's Government as principal shareholder in the Anglo Persian Oil Company makes me anxious to avoid any line of action which might be represented as a championship of that Company based on motives of direct financial interest, 5. In these circumstances, and in view of the delicate relations at present subsisting between His Majesty's Government and the Saltan I desire to give you full discretion to await a favourable opportunity- before reopening the matter with the Sultan. In choosing this opportunity you shoulcjlalso if possible ascertain, and take into consideration, the views of the local represen tative of the D'Arcy Exploration Company. When you do address the Sultan I think that it is desirable that the draft letter submitted by you should be modified on the followin ; o■ trt ft fy : v ^ (I 0 ! 0 s&gt; ' r- following linear- Page 1, la it 3 lines. For tt who ..... G -ovemment' substitute 'who had not taken steps to obtain the pre liminary approval of His Majesty f s Government'. Page 2, line 3, omit 'strongly fl . Page 2, lines 7 - 26. For 'If dominions' substitute 'At the time when Major Holmes approached these Sheikhs, the D'Arcy Exploration Company had already approached Mis Majesty's G-overnment and had discussed with them the terms on which they would be prepared to approve the grant of concessions by the Sheikhs. wis Majesty's Government therefore felt bound to insist upon the Sheikhs giving prior consideration to the Company which had made the first offer and had followed the right procedure. They havadhere fore informed the Sheikhs that they must first consider the offer of the D'Arcy Exploration Company. Of course if the Eastern and General Syndicate offer terms which are in the opinion of His Majesty's Government more favourable to the Sheikhs than the terms which the D'Arcy Exploration Company are prepared to offer then His Majesty's Government will not desire to stand in the Sheikhs' way. But they must first satisfy themselves that the offer is really a better one and that the Syndicate are able to carry out the necessary work. But it must not be hid from you that the Syndicate though a reputable and solid organisation lu.ve not had as much experience in working o.il as the Company. It was not unnatural that they should have sought, as soon as their representative approached your Highness with -a view to obtaining a concession in Nejd, to make an arrange ment with the Company for co-operation andjthe joint working of the concession so that your Highness' dominionsmight benefit by the combined experience of both organiza tions, These negotiations had already proceeded some way when they learned that Major Holmes ha( ■undertaken that no part of the concession should be sold to the Company.' Pa.-e 3, line 2. For sentence beginning 'I would here point out M substitute 'It may be well that I should explain to Your Highness that the D'Arcy Exploration Company is a company which belongs entirely to the Anglo- Persian■Oil Company'. Page 4, line 2 and, onwards. The wordin 0 of the last paragraph is not altogether satisfactory . It would probably be most convenient to omit the whole of the last two paragraphs but if ycru are of opinion that it is deirable to give some explanation, you should confine yourself to the statement that the D ! Arcy Exploration Company already possess the complete machinery necessary for refining and marketing' the oil and that therefore it would be easier and lead to a quicker development of the territory if use could be made of this machinery to bring the oil from Nejd on to the iparket. • 6, In view of all the circumstances of the case i do not feel disposed to stand in the way of the grant to the Eastern and General Syndicate by the Sultan of. !;eid and the Sheikh of Kuwait jointly of a concession over the Heutral Zone referred to in your telegram Ko.771 of the 21st of August, but you should inform the Sheikh of Kuwait that I refrain from offering objection to the grant of a concession in these terms because the Sultan of Nejd has already granted to the Syndicate a concession in similar tenns over a large area in Nejd and|that he should not draw the conclusion that 1 consider that the : termsterms, set out are the most favourable terms which could be obtained. lie should be informed that in my om opinion the terms of the draft concession for Kuwait contained in my despatch No.9 referred to above are likely to be more fav ourab1e. 7, As regards this latter concession the Syndicate have submitted to me a draft from which 1 observe that the area purporting to be covered by the concession is not exactly the same as the area of the neutral zone as shorn in the records of.this Department. The difference is nou ry great, but before the concession is actually granted you should cause it to be examined with a view to ensuring that the area covered by it is accurately defined. This point has been brought to the notice of the Syndicate. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient' humble servant,Native Rulers concerned.

Application in question only referred to ruscat, Trucial Chiefs, Bahrain, Kuwaifet and Nejd, no specific mention being made of Qatar, nevertheless, on reconsideration, T think that it is clear that it was intended to cover the whole of the Arab littoral, and it appears from your despatch of 8th September to the Government of India and your telegram of 9th September 1921 to Muscat that you read it as doing so. In view of the obvious intention of the Anglo Persian and the sxi similarity between the treaty position of Qatar and the Trucial Chiefs 1 propose, unless you have any objection, to admit their claim. Ill) May I assume that objections to Eastern and general application cited in your telegram of 2lst September apply equally to Anglo-Persian?. Grant of concession in any case appears impracticable while Article VII, Art.VTII, Art. IX of &amp;he Treaty with Qatar remain inoperative and I presume the present moment is not favourable for attempt to induce the Shaiidi to give effect to those articles* Devonshire•82/1 .

My records show that Anglo-Persian Oil Company ohly actually applied to prospect in Bin saud's territory, Kuwait, Bahrain, Trucial Coast and Oman. But I know from- remarks of their representatives m- prospocifyOVor wnole Arab littoralj possibly they thought Qatar was incorporated in Bin Saud f s territory - in fact it nearly is. I think their claim to have established prior claim to prospect in Qatar may be admitted. T think before either Anglo-Persian Oil Company or Eastern General enter into negotiations it would be advisable for either Political Agent, Bahrain or myself to visit Qatar and-see what position is vis-a-vis Bin saud. m view of Article. VI of his treaty with us there seems to be no reason why we should acquiesce in any claim of his to have authority over Qatar or to -claim that negociations should be conducted through him unless Shaikh Abdulla has made some definite }, agreement with H.H. admitting latter's sazeminty. If position in this respect satisfactory T see no reason why Shaikh Abdulla should not be approached to grant concession to Anglo-Persian Oil Company^if he proved willing to ™rant r SS» / no doubt he would agree to Article VII of his Treaty being brought into force at same time; T do not think the other two Articles are of any immediate importance# Delay in replying is due to my absence on tour.

In the fatter connection I would refer you to,the letters from this Department Nos.44309 of the 21st September and 46833 of the 24th of September. 2. It is proposed that the reply from this Depart ment should state as regards Bahrein and Kuwait that His G-race regrets that he cannot approve of their applications for concessions, as ne feels 'bound to recog nise the prior claims of other applicants, '(i.e.as you are aware, those of the Anglo Persian uil Company). 3. As regards Qatar His Grace proposes to reply that the status of that Territory and of its Sheikh is not well defined, and that an application for a concession at this juncture would raise political issues which it is very desirable to avoid* that he is, therefore, unable to approve their proposal hut that it will 'be borne in mind should the pres.ent un favourable circumstances change. 4. In regard to the Syndicated letter of the 24th of August, a copy of y /hich is enclosed. His Grace considers that in view of paragraph 7 of the despatch to the Resident at Busliire, which formed the enclosure to the letter under reference, it'will be possible to reply that it has now been made clear to the Resident that His ^ia3esty T s Govern ment have no intention of expressing disapproval of thei ^ /TD- Y\ a3N : v tlie '..-astern and Gensral Syndicate Limited, wliicli they regard on the contrary as a firm of substance and repute. 5. 1 am to request tliat this Department may he informed whether his Lordship concurs in the terms of the proposed reply 1 am, , e ^ Sir, 'Your most obedient servant, 3 d/- J.

I have ascertained that the .riastem Bank have only received one enquiry since the publication of this notice, and that only a casual one on the telephone . i^he Manager has received no instructions with regard to receiving allotments in fact, no communication whatsoever from the 'New Company', and until he does so no application to the Bank will be entertained. I enclose 3 spare copies of this letter and enclo sure in case you may wish to send copies to Koweit and Bahrain, who may be interested. The publication of a notice of this sort in England or in India would, I believe, render the Company liable to prosecution*. Yours sincerely. Colonel A. P.

H.H* the Sultan is specially anxious that Natives of Nejd should have full opportunity of joining in this important and useful enterprise: notice is now given that v/no ever wishes to take up the shares now offered - should forthwith register his name and pay cash to the Eastern Bank. We do not think that natives of Nejd who are famous ror their quickness to learn and desiring progress special advantages for their country will abstain from subscri b ing nor do we think that they will be slow to take t^iis opportunity. r ihe remaining shares will be distributed shortly God is the giver of - - and properity.

I also concur with His Excellency that the style ' Anglo-Persian Oil Company '' is undesirable for a Company obtaining a concession in Bahrain and that it would be advisable to form a subsidiary company to be stvled 'The Arab Coast Oil Company ', or ' c The Arabian Oil Company '. I presume the same Company would prospect all down the Arabian Littoral and Oman, so perhaps it might be styled ' The Eastern Arabian Oil Company unless operating all over Arabia in which case 'The Arabian Oil Company or ' The Anglo-Arabian Oil Company ,5 would be better. 4. As regards Muscat, the present Council of Ministers is very amenable, and I think that if they were sounded by the Political Agent on the subject we should find that' no objection would be likely and that negotiations might be opened at once with the Muscat Government. But as the Government of India a,re aware, the writ of the Muscat Government does not carry far beyond the coast, and what view the Imam and the Omanis would take is difficult to say. I am enquiring from the Political Agent who has just returned to Headquarters if he can give any idea on this point. 5. In respect to the Trucial Coast, I would observe that the Sheikhs and Tribes of this part of the world are extraordinarily ignorant and back ward, and I think that a sudden request for exclusive prospecting rights would be regarded with the greatest suspicion and would meet with deter mined opposition in all the Sheikhdoms. I think it would be best in the case of these Sheikhs to endeavour, in the first instance, to obtain Conventions similar to those made with Kuwait and Bahrain, and later on to try for concession if the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, after prospecting in the neighbouring countries, thought it worth while to prospect on the Trucial Coast. With the exception of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi the Trucial Coast Sheikhs have only a narrow strip of sandy soil between the Oman Hills and the sea; whether this is likely to contain oil or not of course I cannot say, but I should think prospecting there might well be left to the last. 6. I agree with His Excellency the High Commissioner that it would be good policv for the Company to pay a lump sum to clinch the negotia tions, if the Arab Potentates concerned show they would welcome it, and especially if they agree to exempt the machinery of the Company from Customs dues.

I do not think that the procedure suggested by Sir Arnold Wilson viz., that he and I should proceed to Bahrain with the draft agreement and o? the Sheikh to sign it—is likely to be successful, because ths bheikli is very old and obstinate and-will require a lot of talking to before he will agree to sign any such agreement. This, as I have stated in enclo sure JNo. 3, can only be done by the Political Agent in the absence of any representative of the Company resident in the place. When the Political Agent thinks that the Sheikh has adopted a reasonable attitude and shows signs of being willing to sign, a representative of the Company might ^o over with a draft agreement for final discussion and signature.' 3. From enclosure No. 4 it will be seen that the Political Agent, Kuwait ieels certain that Sheikh Ahmad would not sign such an agreement straight off; so I think that it will be best for the Political Agents in both places to do the preliminary negotiations. ^ ^ the procedure indicated abeve is adopted, there wiU be no need to follow that suggested in paragraph 8 of Sir Arnold Wilson's letter, which I think is hardly suitable. As the same agreement is required from the bneikhs of Kuwait and Bahrain and I shall have to deal with the Bahrain one, the most ccnvenient plan would seem to be for me to arrange both but or me to appear at Kuwait on behalf of the High Commissioner and then proceed to Bahrain as the representative of Government seems anomalous.

I beg to apply for permission to negotiate on the same lines with the Sheikh of Bahrain, and to solicit your personal assistance in the matter in due course: I venture to hope that if and when permission to negotiate is granted you will find it possible to be present in person at the negotiations. 3. I further solicit your assistance in obtaining from the T^ucial Chiefs conveDtions in regard to the Lxploit.-ition of Oil similar to those all eady made with Kuwait (27th October 1913) and Bahrain {14-th May 1914). Enclosure II to Serial No. ^.—Letter from Sir A. T. Wilson, Ee-stdent Director, Strick Scott &amp; Co.- Ltd.. to His Excellency the High Commissioner, Baghdad, dated the 22nd December 1921. I have the honour to state that I have, been instructed by the Board of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company Limited to open negotiations with the Sheikhs of Bahrain and Kuwait with a view to concluding agreements with them in connection with Oil in their territories. 2. As you are no doubt aware, it was provided under the arrangements, concluded in 1914 for a fusion of interests in regard to Turkey of the D' Arcy Exploration Company and of the Turkish Petroleum Company that none of the participants would interest themselves in concessions any where in the Ottoman Empire otherwise than through the Turkish Petro leum Company. 3. The Clause in question reads as follows : — ' io. The three groups participating in the Turkish Petroleum Com- d any shall give undertakings on their own behalf and on be half of the Companies associated with them not to be interested directly or indirectly in the production or manu facture of Crude Oil- in the Ottoman Empire in Europe or Asia, except in that part which is under the administration of the Egyptian' Government or of the Sheikh of Kuwait or in the ' Transferred territories' on the Turko-Persian Erontier, otherwise than through the Turkish Petroleum Company '. 4. You will note that the territories of the Sheikh of Kuwait are specifically excluded. 5. The Board do not consider it necessary at this stage^ to incur the considerable expense involved in registering: a new subsidiary Company and propose that negotiations should be conducted on behalf of the D Arcy Exploration Company. I trust that this course wi^] have your concurrence. 6 I enclose a dr^ft of the Concession which T propose to negotiate with the Shaikh of Kuwait, if and when I have your authority to do so, tor which authority I now beg to apply. 7 As regards Article 10 of the draft, in view of the fact that the Bakhtiari Khans are taking such strong exception to the deduction ot in come Tax on dividends to which they are entitled, the Company would ./refer to a share interest ah arrangement under which an annual payment equivalent to 10 per cent, of the nett profits, after providing for deprecia tion etc , should be paid to the Shaikh. Tn this connection reference is invited to the terms on which the A. P. 0. C. holds its concession from the Persian Government: viz., 16 per cent, of nett profits. It is considered by the Board that not more than 10 per cent, would be justified m the case ot Kuwait and Bahrain in view of the somewhat unpromising prospects ot finding oil at either place, and the very heavy capital expenrliture mvclved, and of the purelv nominal assistance in regarcl to protecticn required from the Chiefs at either place—practically no pipe line would be needed tor example if oil were found. 8. I have no official information as to whether Kuwait is at present for purposes of Political Administration under Baghdad or Bushire, and only venture to address you on the subject as the result of ah informal conver- sation with the Political AgentAs however T have also to negotiate with Bahrain, and as I would propose to do so (subject to the approval of the Pohtica atelv after the completion of negotiations with Kuwait, I \enture to as that Lieutenant -Colonel Trevor may be authorised by you to ^ to Kuwait in R. I. M: S. ' Lawrence ' to assist me on your behalf m tne.e negotiations: without your or his presence the Shaikh might, on yew of bis arrangements on the subject with Government, not f- el .]ustihed negotiating. 9.

Reference letter dated the 22nd December 1921 from Resident Director of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company to your address re negotiations with the Sheikh of Kuwait, in which he suggests that I should accompany him to Kuwait with draft agreement for the Sheikh's signature. He has also addressed me asking to be allowed to take similar action in Bahrein. I have not yet received any instructions from Government that negotia tions should be opened but in any case I think it would best for preliminaries to be undertaken by the respective Political Agents. I do not know present Sheikh of Kuwait but I doubt if he would be prepared to sign an agreement of the sort straight off when presented to him by Sir A. Wilson and mvself, and I am quite sure the Sheikh of Bahrein would not. Latter would certain ly require a lot of talking to first and probably former would too. This I think should be left to Political Agents with support from me if necessary, and when Sheikh is amenable representative of Anglo-Persian Oil Company might take over agreement to be discussed and signed.

So far His Majesty's Government hav6 not given permission for nego tiations to be opened, no doubt however they will do so shortly. When they do however I think the best plan will be for the Political Agents to prepare the way by preliminary talks with the respective Sheikhs. I am quite certain that the Sheikh of Bahrain who is as you know very old and rather obstinate^ will never agree to sign an agreement of this sort straight off. He will need a lot of talking to and persuasion which can onl) be done by the Political Ao-ent as there is no representative of the Company resident at Bahrain. 'I do not know the present Sheikh of Kuwait but the Political Agent states that he is quite sure that Sheikh Ahmad would not be willing to sign the, agreement without lengthy discussions and consultations. In the circumstances I think the best course would be to instruct the Political Agent at Bahrain to discuss the question with the Sheikh when ever possible and report when the Sheikh shows signs of becoming amenable; a representative of the Company could then proceed to Bahrain with the draft agreement for final discussion and signature If necessary I would support 'the Political Agent in the preliminary negotiations I think similar procedure would probably be best in Kuwait also.

With reference to the correspondence ending with Foreign and Poli tical Department, endorsement No. 497/107-Ext., regarding the desire oi the Anglo-Persian Oil Company to obtain exclusive prospecting rights on the Arabian shore of the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman, I have the honour to forward herewith for the information of the Government of India, a copy of a letter No. 25-C., dated 19th May 1922, from the Political Agent Muscat, statins: that the Sultan has informed him of a reported show of oil in the Southern part of the Gulf of Masirah, and further that His Highness has ha4 the report verified as far as it can be done by an uneducated and in expert Arab. 2. Prom what Major Rae says it seems almost certain that a seepage exists at the place mentioned. I do not know if the Geological Survey of India would have sufficient data regarding the^ region to enable them to give any opinion as to the chances of obtaining oil in paying quantities. The neighbourhood of Masirah is a wild and savage country, and on more than one occasion, as the Government of India are aware, the crews of wrecked steamers have been maltreated in that region. There is no doubt however that the inhabitants consider themselves within the dominions of the Sultan of Muscat, and that they have nothing to do with the more or less autonomous Omanis inhabiting the country to the West and North-West of Muscat, ihe report of the Sultan's emissary that the natives do not mention the show of oil as they do not want interference is quite probable, and I fancy they would do their best to discourage prospectors and exploiters, who would have to be in a position to protect themselves. 3, However since there seems little doubt that a show of oil exists, it seems advisable to take steps that the future exploitation of it (if necessary) should be done by British interests. On the other hand it seems unlikely that the negotiations with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company regarding a prospecting license for Oman will be settled for some time. I venture there fore to suggest that the Political Agent should be authorized to negotiate with the Sultan an agreement regarding oil in his territories similar to the conventions made by the Sheikhs of Kuwait and Bahrain, or on the lines of the Sur Coal Agreement of 31st May 1902 (No. LXIX, page 242, Aitchison Vol. XII). An agreement on either of these lines would protect British interests, and, as there is now so much competition for oil all over the world, the sooner, in my opinion, an agreement is made, the better. I would there fore suggest that, as the Sultan will not return to M^uscat until December next, the Political Agent may be authorized to negotiate one with His High ness the Sultan, if possible, while on recess in India.

M.'s Consul, Muscat, to the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, No, 25-C., dated Muscat, the 19th May 1922. Oil in Muscat Territory. I have the honour to say that information has been received which seems reliable that there is an oil show near the coast in the southern part of the Gulf of Masirah. The information was given me by H. H. the Sultan who had sent a man specially to verify the information as far as an uneducated and inexpert Arab could do. ' The messenger has reported that oil does show2 at the place where it had been reported to show, but that the people of the neighbourhood wish to keep this secret as they do not want to be interfered with. It would be interesting to know if the Geological Survey of India can say whether there is any probability of a workable supply of oil being found in this neighbourhood. The report of this oil show raises the question of Government's wishes about oil exploitation in Muscat territory. Your telegram* No. 1531, dated 9th September 1921, showed that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company wished to obtain exclusive prospecting rights, but did not show if Government approv- ed of their doing so. I have, therefore, the honour to request that I may be informed if Government desire that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company should or should not acquire all oil interests in Muscat territory. If it is Government's desire that the Anglo-Persian Oil ^Company should acquire all oil interests in Muscat territory I would ask permission to address the Company direct about the examination of the show now report 1 - ed and also about prospecting in Gwadur territory and on the Oman Coast which it might be possible to arrange. Mr. Wingate's reply to your telegram No. 1531, mentioned above dealt only with the possibility of getting exclusive prospecting rights for the Anglo- Persian Oil Company in Oman proper. I think it would be simpler and more effective to obtain an agreement similar to that regarding the Sur Coal fields (Aitchison Vol. XII page 242)^ covering all mineral oil throughout the Sultan s dominions. This would block all concessions not approved by the Government of India. Moreover it would be much easier to arrange for a particular prospecting expedition than for prospecting in general, and in practice it would be necessary to arrange for each expedition separately whe ther there was a general agreement on the subject or not. If any agreement is required it would have to be negotiated with the Sultan personally, and he will not be in Muscat again until December. I could, of course/visit him in India, if required.

In this connection, I beg to forward herewith a copy of a letter No. 1 -C., dated 13th February 1923, from the Political Agent at Muscat forwarding an undertaking given by His Highness the Sultan of Muscat', that he^ will not exploit petroleum in Muscat territory without consulting the Political Agent and without the approval of the Government of India. 3. Some delay occurred in obtaining the under taking, the reason for which Major Eae has explained. This was not due to any unwillingness on the part oi the Sultan to give an undertaking? but merely to his having writ ten rather ambiguously worded undertakings. I recently visited Muscat and His Highness spoke to me on the subject of oil concessions; I gathered that he would be quite ready to give exploration licences, etc., if asked to do so. 4. It will be seen, however^ from the Sultan's undertaking and the concluding portion of Major Rae's letter that the existence of oil in Masira Bay is not defmitelv certain, and that the reoorl thai its oresence had been verified by a special messenger sent by the Sultan (vide enclosure to my letter No. 402-S., dated 2nd June 1922) was based on a misapprehension ' 'Enclosure to Serial No. 51. — L etter from the P olitical A gent , M uscat, to the H on ble the P olitical R esident in the P ersian G ulf, B ushire , N o 1-C., dated the 13 th F ebruary 1923..

I have also the honour to submit in original His Highness's reply. The agreement in its present form was received on the 5th of this month. The date it bears is that of another agreement for which it has been substituted. The delay in obtaining the agreement in its present form has been due to difficulty in reconciling His Highness's views on fitness of expression with my views on intelligibility. I find I was wrong in saying in my letter § No. 24-C., of 19th May 1922 that the existence of oil near the shores of the Gulf of Masirah had been verified by a messenger sent by His Highness the Sultan. I misunderstood what His Highness said about this. He said a messenger had been sent and 'then proceeded to give some details given him by the original reporter which I understood to have been obtained by the messenger. It now seems he merelv gave orders for a messenger to be sent which orders seem to have been for gotten as most business matters are in this countrv.

It was beyond the power of this friend to countermand what is confirmed by this assembly. I called upon vour deputy therefore to refer to Your Honour on the subject, and I agreed to negotiate with him if you accepted the terms of the Holmes agreement as the basis for negotiation 1 deeply regret, however, that 1 received a letter from Mr. Mackie, statins; that i our Honour had not agreed to this, and that he would take leave and abandon his request, • In view of this circumstance, it only remains for this friend to state to you denmtely that he does, firstly, appreciate the important position vou xu i he does secondly, know full well the enterprise and power and the ability of your Company to work. For this reason I was really sorry to see that you broke the negotiations at the outset. You may rest assured that, had the question not been submitted to the assembly of the Ule ma and the Notables I would have endeavoured to afford you satisfaction as far as possible and m any manner- Seeing that it has gone out of this friend s purview, I think that you will excuse me if I: demanded what I asked for as above. . This is what I desired to stat?. and before I close this letter 1 would mention my admiration for the gallantry, gentlemanliness and noble charac- ter of your •deputy, Mr. Mackie, who earned a special regard in our esti mation m consideration of his distinguished characteristics. In conclusion I would beg of you to accept my assurance of esteem. (Sealed). ABDUL AZIZ BIN ABDUR RAHMAN BIN FYSAL AL SAUD. Sub-Enclosure II to Enclosure to Serial No. 65. OIL CONCESSIONS. N ejd. Report by Mr. J. B. Mackie, On my arrival at Bahrein I found awaiting you a letter from Bin Saud nW ? r A dated Februar 7 24th, which I took the libertv of opening and forwarded it to you under cover of my letter No. 3, dated April loth, retaining a copy of the translation for my own file. The position taken up by him in that letter he maintained, with slight modification, throughout the whole of our negotiations, namely that the negotrntions with the Eastern General Syndicate had reached a point at which he had given them a definite promise that he would grant them the-■vi ^r^WTi ill ti r ii— concession on the terms already agreed to, subject to one or two slight modifications which Major Holmes was at that time considering and pro vided that the High Commissioner at Baghdad could assure him that the Eastern and General Syndicate was a genuinely British Company. This assurance, he says, has now been received from the High Commissioner. Acting on the instructions given me in your telegram dated April 17th I suggested to him that the Colonial Office did not regard him as having made any binding promises, but his reply was that the opinion of the Colonial Office did not really affect the matter in this instance and in any case seeing that a large part of the agreement had been drafted through the agency of Sir Percy Cox's secretaries, whom he and Ibn Saud and Major Holmes met at Ujair some months ago, and that it was largely through Sir Pircy Cox's intervention that he had consented to give the concession ,to the Eastern and General Syndicate at all, he did not see that the Colonial Office was in a position to do anything except support the Eastern and General Syndicate now, unless it was to be guilty of a complete volts face, and he did not think that Sir Percy Cox would agree to any such complete change of front. After several interviews which I had with him and his representatives, I got him to agree in writing that if we, while accepting the administrative and political provisions of the Eastern and General Syndicate's draft, were willing to improve on their financial offer he would consent to open nego tiations. but referred the right to refer our enhanced offer to the Eastern and General Syndicate to see if they would bid higher again. I replied to him that in our draft, many of the administrative and political clauses had been copied word for word from the Eastern a^d General Syndicate's draft, and that those which were not so, differed only in as far as we had made arrangements for the grant of the concession to cover the whole of the Sultan's territories—subject to our entering territory outside the Hasa province only by the Sultan's definite permission—and by the inclusion of certain clauses which were as much in the interests of the Sultan as those of the Company, regarding the occupation and acquisition by the Company of private property, some of which he was himself asking the Eastern and General Syndicate to include in their agreement. ' Ibn Saud said that he could not consider the grant of the concession for any area outside the Hasa province. The time was not yet ripe for the admission of foreign influence into the less civilised parts of his realm. That is the attitude which he always adopts when he is in a tight corner, namely that of a Sultan having but little hold over a fanatical crowd of savages who frequently get out of hand. As a matter of fact, however, he has the Ikhwan completely under his control and it is only in the more enlightened towns that he has any difficulty in enforcing his authority. I explained to him that that need not stand in the way of our negotiations, I could not, on my own authority, accept the confinement of the concession to the Hasa province only but I would refer the matter to you and I had no doubt that, considering the circumstances, you would agree. Then it was that he produced the argument which he afterwards used to block any suggestion which did not suit his views; and regarding the validity of which I have made careful enquiries without, however, obtaining anv definite result. He claims that he is not a free agent in such matters as this but is bound by a Council of Ulama at Riyadh under the presidency of his father. One evening when I had called on him and found him alone, without even any of his confidential secretaries, he professed to explain to me the position of this council and how it came into existence. ' You will understand he said ' that I do not belong to the senior branch of the Saud family, and so, in the ordinary course of events should not have attained to my present position. The senior representative of the senior branch is one Saud who now lives with me, but who, a few years ago, raised the standard of revolt in the Southern provinces with a view to getting for himself the position which I now hold.' ' Ibn Saud, having crushed the revolt thought it advisable to come to terms with his opponents and consented to the formation of a council of Ulama under the presidency ' ^ i t] VM H4 of his father to whom all important questions should be referred, he being left considerable freedom of action in general matters but being merely the Council's executive officer as regards matters which have been referred to it. He professes to be very anxious regarding the security of his position and very afraid lest he may give his opponents a loophole for getting in a telling blow on him. How far that this claim that this Council .is a power ful body whose views he dare not oppose is true, or how far it is merely a foil to be used when he wants to block proposals made to him, I was unable to discover very clearly. There seems to be some difference of opinion about it, at any rate among the people of Hasa. It is certain that the council exists and that the Eastern and General Syndicate's draft was shown to its members before any reply was given about it, but there are some grounds for the belief that it is ' Ibn Saud's servant much more than his master. The presidency of the council can easily be made by a master ful individual, a position of paramount importance in the state and in the course of a conversation one evening, ' Ibn Saud gave me a very broad hint that when his father dies he may himself appoint one of his sons Sultan and himself become Imam of the Ikhwan and president of the Council, a position which would give him immense power and authority while at the same time allowing him to disclaim all responsibility whenever he found it convenient to do so. Be that as it may be, however, it was this claim of his which finally blocked my negotiations with him. He maintained that, in spite of all argument, that he would not dare to give affront to the Council by making fresh proposals to them after they had discussed and accepted the Eastern and General Syndicate's draft as it now stood— subject to certain modifications which they had demanded—and the only conditions under which he would be willing to negotiate with the A. P. O. C. was that we should accept the whole of the Eastern and General Syndicate s draft and the modifications asked for word for word in both the English and , Arabic versions and that in addition we should make a financial offer which showed a clear advance over anything which the Eastern and General Syndicate had offered. At the same time he refused point ^ blank to receive his royalty in any other form other than by share participation, insisted on the payment of 1 per cent, export duty as laid down in the Eastern and General Syndicate's draft and on the payment of import duty on all the goods imported for the personal use of the Company s Stan, and at the same time while admitting that our offer to pay the guards was -*■ an advance on the offer made by our rivals, declaring that he was quite willing to pay them himself. It seemed to me that in spite of his plausible talk and flattering refer ences to the Company he had never any intention of giving us the conces sion if he could possibly help it, and he intended to use us merely as a means of getting the Eastern and General Syndicate to bid higher than they had already done. That being so he was not little surprised and dis appointed when I informed him that I had been instructed to break oil negotiations. I informed him before leaving, however, that if his nego- tiations with the Eastern and General Syndicate did finally«break down we were leaving the door of negotiations open and were willing to discuss . the matter with him at any time, but using our draft as the basis ot the discussions. ^ Finally I desire to place on record by appreciation ot the way m which ' Ibn Saud treated me while at Hasa. Slaves, ^ camels and horses placed at my disposal. I was given full permission to go where I liked, even into the fort and the armoury, and on one occasion he did me the honour of calling on me in my own house, an honour which, I am told, he confers on very few of his visitors. Translations of letters which passed between me and 'Ibn Saud have already been forwarded to you under cover of my letters No. 18 and JNo. 11, dated April 24th and May 8th. (Sd.) J. B. MACKIE.

K mo ait Oil Concession. My Lord Duke, In the Secretary of State for India's telegram' No. 1846, of the 18th May 1923, I was informed that His Majesty's Government wished me to endeavour to secure from the Shaikh of Kuwait a definite undertaking that he would give no oil concession to any other company than the D'Arcy Exploration Company to which His Majesty's Government intended to give preference over all other interests in Kuwait. I now have the honour to forward to Your Grace a copy of a draft agreement which was submitted to the Shaikh of Kuwait by Sir Arnold Wilson with my approval; and a minute of a conversation on the subject of that draft between Sir Arnold Wilson and the Shaikh at Kuwait on the 2nd June last. The draft which was presented to the Shaikh differs considerably, Your Grace will observe, from the separate agreements I was originally directed to help the Company to negotiate; and principally in this that whereas the present draft includes in one document exploration license, -prospecting license and a definite lease for sixty years, my instructions w^ere merelv to encourage the conclusion of the first two, and as to the third, to confine myself to obtaining ' an agreement to sign ' ultimately such a lease. The only object of that ' agreement ' being obtained now was apparently to safe guard the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in the matter oi profits which the Shaikh might endeavour to force up later on in the event of oil being found in abundance; and it was no doubt the intention of His Majesty's Government to leave over for subsequent consideration the other points which might remain. But they apparently did not contemplate the drawing up now of an exploitation lease in its final form. The position has, however, materially altered since these instructions were conveyed to me last November. The appearance in the field of the Eastern and General Syndicate as an energetic and open rival of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in Arabia was a new factor in the situation which encouraged the Shaikhs to play off one party against the other, and generally undermined the position of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. Sir Arnold Wilson's desire in the circumstances to get the position of his Company defined once and for all, and without more delay, seemed to me entirely reasonable. In face of Major Holmes' active methods, it did not seem to me to be a time for procrastination; and I believed that it would accord with the views of His Majesty's Government that I should interpret l xi—396.2 as literally as possible my obligation to-assist the Anglo-Persian Oil Com pany while safeguarding at the same time the Shaikh's interests. But in order to give His Majesty's Government freedom to step in and amend, if they thought fit, any clause whatever throughout the whole agreement, I stipulated for the insertion of clause 18 of the draft to which I venture to invite Your Grace s particular attention. Sir, Arnold Wilson very willingly fell : n with my views. The opinion which Sir Arnold Wilson and I both formed of the damag ing nature of Major Holmes' activities, was supported by the exceedingly cautious attitude taken up by the Shaikh when we visited him at Kuwait recently I had 1 it from Major More that in March last the Shaikh was ready enough to enter into a binding lease with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and was merely disposed to cavil at one or two minor points in that Company's proposals. He now showed a determined disinclination to commit himself in any way beyond giving verbally, and in satisfactorily clear terms, the required assurance that he would not enter into a concession with any other Company than the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. This assurance which he gave to Sir Arnold Wilson in the course of his conver sation of the 2nd June, he repeated to me in the presence of the Political Agent on the following day, and in equally emphatic language. I understand that, for their part, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company are in no hurry to exploit the bhaikh's territory; their chief anxiety was to be certain that no other party would be able to obtain a footing there. In this they have succeeded; and although he would have preferred that the lease should have been accepted by the Shaikh, Sir Arnold Wilson expressed to me his satisfaction at the present stage which the negotiations have reached. I am not without hope that with the disappearance from the scenes of Major Holmes, and after he has taken counsel with the Shaikh of Mohammerah, the Shaikh of Kuwait will arrive at a satisfactory under standing with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. I still await the despatch from the Secretary of State + or India pro mised in his telegram 1846 of May 18th, which is to convey to me the additions to the terms of the Kuwait Concession I was originally directed to procure. I hope that these will not conflict with the terms 0' the draft lease which I have already offered to the Shaikh, and that Your Grace will agree that'in the present circumstances, if the two parties wish to come to terms, it is advisable that any agreement signed now should be in the form of a final and conclusive lease. Sub-Encl'o. I to Enclo. to Serial No. 66. AGREEMENT BETWEEN Shaikh Ahmad-al-Jabor as-Subah,, C.I.E., Ruler of Kuwait and Dependencies, of the one part, hereinafter called the Shaikh ', and the D'Arcy Exploration Company Limited, of the other part, hereinafter called '' the Company.''

Minute of a meeting between Sir A. T. Wilson, and Shaikh Ahmad-ul-Jaber as-Sahah, Ruler of Kuwait, on the 2nd June 1923. Sir A. T. Wilson asked the Shaikh if he had had time to peruse the d,raft of proposed agreement between the Shaikh and the D'Arcy Explora tion Co. and to offer such remarks as he may have. The Shaikh replied in the affirmative, adding that he will have to make many observations and suggestions for modifications. He pointed out that, seeing that the agreement affected the vital interests of his country and of its people, it would be unfair for him to expedite the conclusion thereof without due consideration and consultation. He would, on the other hand, be doing an injustice to the Company if he rejected any of their proposals off-hand. Furthermore, he would be guilty of telling the Company an untruth if he promised to undertake anything which was beyond his power to perform. ' This affair is of a commercial nature he went on to say, ' and it needs considerable deliberation in order that full justice may be done to both parties.' Sir A. T. Wilson stated that, in view of his friendship for the Shaikh and his loyalty to His Majesty's Government, he would in no wise attempt to force the Shaikh's hands by bringing the least pressure to bear upon him, and that the latter could consider the agreement with due care. Colonel Knox had already wired for a ship for his voyage and intended leaving Kuwait on Monday night after dining at the Shaikh's palace; and Sir A. T. Wilson would prolong his stay at Kuwait till Thursday and leave the place by the Slow Mail if the Shaikh was inclined to think that it would be possible for him to discuss the terms by that time. If the Shaikh did not think so, however. Sir A. T. Wilson would leave Kuwait in company with the Political Resident. The Shaikh answered that, while he wished to settle the matter with all possible speed, he would beg of Sir Arnold not to urge upon him to hasten a decision. ' I will not make any contract with any Company except the one presided over by you, and of this you may rest assured.' He added that there were many modifications for him to suggest; that he would read one article of the agreement after another, suggest such altera tions as may be required by the interests of his country and submit such new articles as he may deem fit. Sir A. T. Wilson inquired if the Shaikh could think of discussing any of the articles in this meeting, so that those provisions on which both parties agreed may be known and those over which they disagreed may be reserved for future discussion. The Shaikh rejoined by saying that it would surely take sometimes to do so and that he would request for an ample respite to deliberate on the different points. ' But I tell you he remarked, ' that I shall not enter into an agreement with any other Company without your information.' Sir A. T. Wilson asked the Shaikh if this assurance could be given to him in writing. The Shaikh replied to this I give you mj word of honour that I will not conclude any contract with any Company without informing you, at first, of the terms suggested by them. This word I give you in view of the friendship and regard I entertain for you personally, as I have regarded you as my father over even more.' While thanking the Shaikh for the above assurance. Sir A. T. Wilson reiterated his remark with reference to his departure, and stated that his purpose in inviting the Shaikh to discuss such of the terms as he could was to avoid a further visit by him to Kuwait, as he, Sir Wilson,, had to proceed to Baghdad and perhaps to Tehran and that he did not presume that it would be convenient for him to visit Kuwait again. The Shaikh observed that he was aware of the fact that Sir Wilson was verv busy with important matters, but that the Shaikh himself would be visiting Basrah in a few days, say a fortnight, and would take an opportunity of discussing the matter with Sir Wilson there, failing which -•c.he would no doubt refer to the representative of the Government at Kuwait. ' But you should not have the least doubt,' he added, ' that I will not enter into any agreement whatever with any Company except the one of which yoii are the head, without informing you beforehand.' Sir Wilson explained to the Shaikh the addition made by him to article 10 of the proposed agreement. The Shaikh appeared to be pleased with the same and observed that it was useful for him. He repeated to Sir A. T.. Wilson his intention of visiting Basrah and meeting Sir Wilson at Moham- merah, but he emphasised again that it was not advisable to discuss the conditions of the agreement without due meditation on his part.

The instructions contained in the telegram cited above have no doubt been acted on by you ere this but, in view of the opinion expressed by Mr. Mackie / representative of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in Bahrain, in correspondence with Sir Arnold Wilson that any intervention by you in their favour is likely, in view of the present opinion held by the Shaikhs {vide paragraph 2 of your telegram No 70-C.. dated 1st June 1923, to my address) to hamper, rather than forward, the Anglo Persiai Oil Company negotiations with the Shaikhs, you may have found it difficult to give Mackie such assistance as he may properly ask from you, by using your in^ fluence with Shaikh Hamad '. This clause in your instructions will now be held in obeyance and you will only render such assistance when the Anglo-Persian Oil Company re quire it and will not press your assistance on them nor discuss the matter further with Shaikh Hamad without their approval. l Suh -Enclosure to Enclosure to Serial No. 71.

To S haikh H amad, fully empowered agent of the Shaikh of Bahrain. r After Compliments, My dear friend, I find myself obliged to write to you what I have already verbally in formed you that as at present advised, I see no possibility of the BritishGovernment approving the concession you have given to Major Holmes, the representative of the Eastern and General Syndicate, and must furthet' request you to inform that gentleman in writing that you already consider that agreement void and of no effect, since you have received an official inti mation from the representative of His Majesty's Government in these waters that it is not approved. I must further point out to you, 0 my friend, that your respected father. Shaikh Isa, was not acting in accordance with the promise giver, by him to Major Trevor on the 18th Jamadi II, 1332 when he concluded oven a provisional agreement or granted a provisional concession to Major Holmes, the wording of that letter is very strong ' I wiU not entertain overtures from any quarter regarding kerosine oil without consulting the Political Agent in Bahrain and without the approval of the High Government When your respected father discussed the question with Major Holmes and gave him a written concession, hedged about with no matter what con ditions, he broke his promise to the High Government. It is no excuse to say that as Major Holmes had concluded an agreement with H. H. the Sultan of Nejd, you therefore assumed that Major Holmes was a person acceptable to the British Government. What may suit the British Govern ment in regard to Bin Saud, may not suit them in regara to Bahrain and in any case it was necessary for you to make sure before entangling yourself with Major Holmes. I trust that this letter will impose caution on yourself for the future and shall look forward to receiving, in due course, a copy of your written communication to Major Holmes regarding which you should, before des patch, consult the Political Agent, Bahrain.

I have now the honour to forward for Your Grace's information a copy of the report received from the Political Agent, Bahrain, on this subject, and concur entirely in the opinion expressed by the Political Agent, Bahrain. In view of the very wide discretion with which Your Grace has been good enough to honour me in the last paragraph of your telegram &gt; of the 13th July 1923 on the subject of the Nejd Oil Concession, I am forwarding a copy of this letter to the Political Agent,. Bahrain, for information and guidance and with an intimation that the Political Agent may casually inform Shaikh Hamad now that Government has no desire to force his hand m any way, and that the Political Agent may use his discretion to bring Shaikh' Hamad to a different frame of mind when he considers it advisable to attempt to do so. I shall continue to keep the Political Agent an fait with further deve- lopments in Nejd and Kuwait so that he may bring his particular policy into line with the general policy to be followed in dealing with the various Shaikhs on the Arab littoral of the Persian Gulf in regard to this matter of oil concessions.

I find the attitude of Shaikh Hamad such that he is unlikely at the moment to agree to grant a concession to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company except under very severe pressure, which I think it is an inopportune time to exert, and that possibly a concession granted now under direct pressure- might, in fact, be detrimental to the interests of the company. If, as I understand, the matter is not now of immediate urgency. I would suggest that it be allowed to stand over for a time and severely left alone and that I be authorised to return to it after a few months, when I think it should bo possible to gradually induce Shaikh Hamad to alter his view I have always found him amenable to gradual persuasion but for the present people have undoubtedly put it into his head that Government has ulterior motives in supporting the A P. O. C,. If I were authorised to casually inform him now that Government have no desire to force his hand in any way, I feel sure that in due course it will be possible to bring him to a different frame of mind, (Sd.)
