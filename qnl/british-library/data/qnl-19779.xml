Dear Mr, Laithwaite, Many thanl-is for your letter of the 9th instant, I now learn that 1he only rifle Ivlr. Barnett took with him is a little .22 rook rifle, as, I understand, he is an enthusiast on miniature rifle shooting, so I hardly imagine that this weapon will excite any envy from the Bedouin, and therefore propose to leave the matter, as it stands. We have told him to be sure and get some fishing tackle on his way out and hope that he will supplement his diet from the source Col. Loch so kindly 'brings to our notice. Yours sincerely, (Sd.)

Dear Mr. Laithv/aite, I enclose a copy of the draft of the Agreement I propose to send out to Llr. Yusuf Kannoo for him to get the signature of the Sheikh of Sharjah. The paragraphs in red ink in the left hand side of each page are merely explanatory notes for the personal information of lir. Kannoo, to enable him to grasp our point of view and to put it before the Sheikh. I would ask your consent to paragraph 8-1 can see no other way in which to provide for the settlement of any difference under the agreement, as I presume, no established system of law, runs at Sharjah, so put the clause in as it reads, in the hope that I may enlist the good offices of the Resident, in case of any difference of opinion. I am trying to get the agreement out to Hr. Kannoo by air mail, next Friday - as Mr. Barnett should arrive at Musa about the 8th February and I think it essential to get the matter fixed up before his arrival, so that under these circumstances it would be very helpful if I might have your approval of the draft or any comments as early as possible next week, as it will take a little time to geti. the documents finally prepared. Yours sincerely, .G.Laithwaite, Esq., E.G.

' HEIOjEY OH 'IHAL'IES Dear Mr. Laith^aite, Tiiaiiirs for your letter of the 25th instant which I received on Saturday afternoon and for your kindness In sending it by 'Express' post. In regard to the question of assignment of the agreement, I have looked upon this, as mentioned on the telephone, not as a commercial matter 'between the Sheik and myself 'but as a Political matter between the India Office and myself, hence I omitted any reference to it as regards the former but in regard to the latter, I am heppy to repeat my assurances on the subject. It is, perhaps, put simplest, if I say that I undertake that the agreement in question will not be assigned by me to any party, whatsoever, until I have first received the sanction of the India Office to so doing. This undertaking, being absolutely unqualified, seems to me to cover all contingencies - if it does not I shall be pleased to repeat its substance in any form of words considered more appropriate. I am enclosing a copy of the agreement, as sent by me now by air mail to Mr* Yusuf Kanuco for him to negotiate its signing* You will see that all the detail points you mention have been dealt with, in such manner as I am advised will carry out the purpofC of your observations.I have asked Mr. Karmoo to shew the final agreement to Colonel Loch, if he wishes to see it, as oy -i this reaches yoa, the same air mail vail have 'been missed, and in case you may vjisn x-o dravj iiis atuenuion u o any points, 'by cable • In regard to clause 2 of the agreement, I would mention that en indefinite period, for as long as v?anted, is in oar experience, the asaal method in miiun^ royalties and that it may be of Interest to you to know 71 hat royalties the Golden Valley Ochre and Oxide Go. Ltd., pay elsewhere, tnese are 1 *• At Wick, Somerset Is/od to 2s/-d per ton aver a. &gt;3 in Spain Pesetas 3 to 4 - lor exceptional quality perhaps Ps. 5/- per ton (about 2s/5d at exchange rates) South Africa, ls/~d to Es/6d per ton. This includes the right to dump end store and destroy the surface of ground mich is often of some value, which can hardly 'be said of Musa. These also are for 'mines of a 'proved' nature. I mention these to reassure you that vvc are not attempting to drive a 'hard 'bargain' with the Sheik. In regard to the method of measurement of the ore, were I the Sheik, I should prefer the method I first suggested, because I should think that were the exporters of evil intent they might possibly 'buy' my Agent and so get the amount under-estimated but that as the shipping Company will 'be getting something like ten times the amount /• &amp; 1 11113. amount per ton, for freight, as I was for the material, it is so much more in their interest to charge the utmost they can on the quantity hasis. I quite see, hovyever, that an ijrab Sheik may viell imagine that all foreigners mil put their heads together to defraud him, so have incorporated the alteration, I realise that it is a part of the duty of your Department to see to it that the oust interests of the Sheik are protected - even, nowever, ssere that not so, I should feol that it would ill-become .ne, after receiving all the help which I have had, from yourself and the Political Officers in The Persian Gulf to question, what, after explanations by myself, you consider fair - so I hope that the agreement, as now prepared, mil fully meet all the points raised. In the agreement you mil see that I have nov? made it clear that each year the Sheik will receive his Minimum' 1 royalty of Hs»2C00 in advance, as I imagine that by doing so he mil have a feeling of assurance of our good intenti ons.

Telegram dated 11-2-1935 from Hajji Yusuf Kanoo. of telegrams exchanged with Ha.1ji Yusuf Kanoo, while I was on tour in H.M.S Fowey. 3. Hajji Yusuf Kanoo's telegram was not altogether clear, ^ /but'but I thought that it was best to let him get the Shaikh to accept a modified agreement and for Ha.iji Yusuf Kanoo to agree to it subject to the approval of Commander Bayldon, rather than that he should remain at Sharjah with the possibility of difficulties springing up. I contented myself with suggesting the insertion of a clause to cover acts of aggression committed by foreigners. 4. Unfortunately Hajji Yusuf Kanoo did not get ny telegram till he was at the Airways Station after having finished business with the Shaikh. I enclose a copy of Hajji Yusuf Kanoo f s letter dated the 12th February 1935 to Commander R.C.Bayldon and of Shaikh Sultan bin Saqar f s letter dated the 7th February 1335 to Hajji Yusuf Kanoo. Hajji Yusuf Kanoo thinks that there will be no difficulty in getting Shaikh Sultan to agree to altering his third condition to read instead of the words 'I will not be responsible' the words n I will make enquiries and inform the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf n . I recommend that Commander Bayldon be advised to add these words when drawing up a revised copy of his concession. 5. I see no political objection to the other clauses desired by the Shaikh, though it is for consideration whether in clause (l) the words 'or extension of it' might not be added after the words 'this contract'. In clause (4) there is a possibility of the Shaikh wanting the huts for the labourers built in some inconvenient spot, but I do not think that in practice any difficulty is likely to arise. I have the honour to be Sir, Your most obedient servant. ?ut-Colonel, Political Agent, Bahrain.■Cyanslatlon . Telegram:- In cleir (in Arabic).

I returned from Sharjah by yesterday's Imperial Airways plane at 5 P.M. On arrival at Sharjah I opened the matter with the Shaikh and showed him the Agreement which I had taken with me for his signature. On being read the Agreement by the Shaikh, he raised the following objections. 1. That why Rupees five hundred were deducted from the amount when this amount was to him in lieu of his signing the concession. 2. That Sir Bu Na f ir was not mentioned in the previous Agreement, and why it is mentioned in this Agreement, and further said that fcfc© new agreement should be made for Sir Bu NaHr, but any how after dieeussions, the Shaikh overlooked the above two objections. He demanded four further conditions which he wants to be inserted in the Agreement sent by you. He (Shaikh) added that if the Commander agreed to his four conditions, he would sign the Agreement. I am herewith enclosing the Shaikh's letter in original which contains his four conditions demanded by him. I have duly translated Shaikh's letter in English for your perusal, and shall be glad to hear whether these conditions meet to your approval. If these conditions are approved by you, will you kindly let me know as early as possible with your authority, so that I may add these four conditions in your Agreement, as desired by the Shaikh, in the presence of Colonel Loch. Kindly return the Arabic letter to me.47 lU 7 HMED KANOO. s:-'KANOOV 5 AND A.B.C. ST 1 ? EON. 'i&amp; N ° ^ BaJur^in-g iHth x&amp;35.

You should reply to Persian note in writing on following lines: His Majesty^ Government are unable to accept Persian protest or to agree that Persia has any ground lor complaint in regard to grant of red oxide concession in Abu Musa by Shaikh of Sharjah as Persian Government are aware His Majesty^ Government have never admitted Persian claim to this Island or recognised that she has any rights in respect of it and they are not prepared to do so now. Nor can they agree that any ?case arises ot infringement of status quo agreement between His Majesty's Government and Persian Government. That agreement cannot be held to preclude an occupant of any territory from proceeding with normal commercial development of territory in his occupation and as Persians are well aware that concession which has now been granted with full approval of His Majesty's Government in respect of Abu Musa is only one of a series of concessions which have been granted over a period of many years by legitimate owners of islands. 2. I leave you discretion as to precise wording of note. So long as point of view of His Majesty's Government as / Telegram From To Repeated-2- as set out above is placed beyond any dispute there is no objection to making it as friendly and courteous as you wish. In the event of any oral discussion you might, if you think fit, toake use of argument that Persians would presumably not contend that development by Persian concessionnaire of natural resources of Sirri was violation of the status quo. -Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.

Name and Date. Letter dated 9th ^une 1935 from Mr. J.M.Barnett. Abu ^usa Oxide,v&gt; Working Oxide at Abu ^msa . Ever since arriving at Abu Musa Island in February last I havebeen entirely dependant on certain Persian-Arabs for mails, stores and provisions. Communication with Sharjah (and therefore with rny ^ompany) has been very haphazard and I have been systematically overcharged for stores and provisions. Conditions have been rendered very awkward by being dependant on these people. I did not wish to lodge any complaint before, as I considered it better to try to work amicably with them until such time as a consignment of ore could be sent home and given a trial by my Company.. As a Br .tlsher however I strongly object to casual treatment from this type of hybrid Oriental. Specific complaints are as follows:- a) .No replies to my letters from Abu Musa asking for extra labour and suitable boats for loading S.S n Registan Tt , with the result that before loading operations commenced I had no idea as to the size of the labour force at my disposal or the number or capacity of the boats available and was therefore unable to organise labour and make previous arrangements for loading. (S). Half the labour force which was eventually sent from Sharjah (S4 coolies) arrived one day late (l had previously notified my agents of the expected date of arrival of the Ship and the conditions of loading - namely, 43 hours time allowance). The late arrival of these men from Sharjah was not due to adverse weather conditions. In actual fact the steamer arrived one day later than I had been notified. Had she arrived on the day I expected her, these coolies would have been too late to work at all. (3)0 Sending as tindal with this extra labour force a Persian whom I had previously discharged from my errployment for inefficiency. /(4)|V* 2. (4). Engaging this labour force at an exhorbitant rate of pay- without first consulting with me as to their pay. N.B . This labour force was composed entirely of Persian speaking natives. (5). General slackness in providing with stores. At times either Ignoring my orders for food or sending food of inferior qua Lity. (6). Undermining discipline on the Island by interfering with my employees. (^O* A studied lack of attention in various small masters and by making things as difficult and uncomfortable as possible. (8)• Addressing me in a manner of easy familiarity and attempt ing to dictate to me in various small matters. (9). Late or non delivery of letters. Note. During my stay on the Trucial Coast I have acquired a slight knowledge of Arabic I have found sufficient for most purposes in connection with ny work. I have remarked the fact that latterly since I have become slightly more proficient in Arabic my Agents always converse together in Persian v r hen in my presence. sd/- J.M.Barnett. Sharjah. 5th June 1935.Sir Na'ir island * On arrival at Gharjah from Abu Musa Island I received a letter from the Political Agency at Bahrain to the effect that one of H.M's Sloops would not be available for a visit to Sir Bu Na 1 ir Island, I therefore made arrangements with my Company^ Agents for a motor lauch to take me to the Island. This launch had a crew of seven, including the man in charge and the mechanic. Left SharJah at about 11•30 p*m May ?0th. Weather conditions good, practically dead calm. On leaving Sharjah the course was set at about 265° Mag. the estimated speedof the boat was about seven miles per hour. I did not again check the course until about 8.30 a.m the following morning when I found it to be approximately correct. There was no land in sight. After continuing on this co rse for about another three hours, the man in charge told me that we had missed the island, had passed it and were now too far to the westward. The distance from Sharjah to Bu Na'ir Island is approximately 75 miles. We had been travelling for about 12 hours and provided that the estimated speed of 7 m.p.h of the launch was correc-c it was obvious that we were too far to the westward. The man in charge now informed me that the petrol supply was only just sufficient to take us back to Sharjah. We turned round and proceeded in theopposite direction until dark when we anchored for the night in 18 fathoms. We started again soon after daybreak the following morning and sighted Dibai at about 3 p.m and followed the coast to Sharjah. I subsequently found out that during my absence one of H.M T s Sloops had called for me at Sharjah with a view to giving me a passage to Sir Bu Na f ir Island. During the tine I was in this motor boat the crew conversed together in Persian and although not exactly hostile towards me, they most certainly conveyed a disrespectful and unfriBndly attitude.2. My personal opinion is that they did not intend to reach the Island and by taking me on this trip spoilt my chances of getting to the Island in one of £[.54*8 Sloops. The excuse for missing the Island as related to me afterwards was that there was an adverse set of the tide. On board the launch the man in charge said ' It must have been the wind during the night'. This, as I pointed out to him was absurd, as the effect of the wind was practically negligible. In any case the arrangement I made on hiring the launch was that I should be conveyed by launch to Sir 3u Na'ir Island. ^ happened to iiave a map and a Prismatic Compass with me but die not bring them With any idea of navigating and did not in any was interfere with the nan in charge. The sum agreed on to pay for the bill of the launch was naturally to include payment for navigation. My opinion is that the launch was purposely run several miles southward of her proper course during the first night after leav/ng Sharjah when I was asleep.

The Sheikh of Shargah is an independent ruler in special treaty relations with His Majesty's Government. Under the terms of his treaties he is precluded frcm entering into any agreement or correspondence with any power other than the British Government, fran consenting without the consent of His Majesty's Government to the residence within his territory of the agent of any other Government, and fran ceding, selling, mortgaging, or otherwise giving for occupation any part of his territory, save to His Majesty's Government. He has also undertaken a variety of obligations in relation to the prohibition of the slave trade, the arms traffic, and the maintenance of the Maritime Truce in the Persian Gulf. His I^ajesty's Government on their part have undertaken ider R .C. Bayldon, R.N. (Retd. ) , ^illotts House , Henley-on-Thames. certain/^0 2. certain specific obligations in regard to the defence of the Sheikh's vessels against attack while the effect of the undertakings entered into above is to vest in them responsibility for his foreign relations. Thus while Shargah is an independent State the Sheikh enjoys a measure of British protection and under the terms of their treaties with him His Majesty's Government occupy a special position in relation to his State. It will, of course, be for the Board of Gust cms to decide on the statement of the position given above, any question regarding nationality for the purposes of import duty. 3. His Majesty's Government recognise the Island of Abu Musa as being the property of the Sheikh, and the concession which he recently gave to your Company was given with their approval.

The two gentlemen referred to therein are proceeding by Strict*s steamer to Sharjah, and by local dhow to the Island of Bu Musa, and there is no likelihood of their travelling to Bahrein and Koweit. We therefore return the Passports herewith, and shall be glad, if it is convenient to you, if you will kindly cancel the availability of the Passports for Bahrein and Koweit, making the Passports available for Sharjah and Bu Musa. If later on it is found necessary for these gentlemen to visit Bahrein and Koweit the necessary visas can then be obMned. Will you please send the amended Passports direct to Messrs. P.C.Strick &amp; Co&lt;,Ltd., 7 Brazennose Street,MANCHESTER, 2, to avoid delay. Thanking you in anticipation of your prompt attention to this matter. We are, dear Sirs, Yours faithfully.

'e have had a report from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf that the Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaimah has asked that he may be informed whether the Golden Valley Ochre and Oxide Company are interested in the oxide on the Islands of Tamb and Little Tamb so that, i-- t ley are not, he may be free to dispose of it to any others who may approach him. These islands are the property of the Jowasimi Sheikhs of the Arab coast, namely, the Sheikhs oi Ras-al-Khaimah and Sharjah. The former is, so to speak, the 'senior partner', and it is he to whom the island actually belongs at the present time, without prejudice to the rights of the Sheikh of Sharjah. Any agreement in regard to oxide mining on the islands must accordingly be made with the Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaimah. I understood you to say that although, of course, the Company's energies are at the moment devoted to your .von; on the Island of Abu Musa, they would certainly still be interested in the possibility of mining on the Tamb Islands, out that, of course, the first question for consideration would be the quality of the deposits on these islands. You suggested accordingly that the Sheikh might be asked to procure and send to the Company's local agent samples of the deposits in question. We/ Bayldon, R.N. 1'■. r e have communicated in this sense with the Political Resident and with the Political Agent at Bahrein, through whom any communications from the Company to tle Sheikh should pass. We assume that yoj will communicate in the same sense with your local agent. Would you kindly let me know if you wish to suggest any addition or correction to this account of our interview ? As I understand that your people will only be working in the Gulf until April, we have actually seno off a letter to the Political Resident 'by to-night's air mail, out we can of course follow it up with another letter, if necessary.

As we now have our representative - Commander Rainier - at Abu Musa, may I suggest that it would better suit our convenience as well as save time, if the documents might be forwarded by your Office to Colonel Loch and if he would be kind enough to send them direct to Commander Rainier at Musa after a similar procedure in respect to interpretation and the Representative at Sharjah has been carried out. Commander Rainier will then go to Sharjah to get them completed. I would mention that I understand the Sheik rather desires to bind us to take a minimum of ICO tons per annum. We however cannot agree to this as the market for this specialised ore is very small and uncertain, this ore is found in other places and it is simply that as we are making large shipnents of oxide from Musa it suits us to include a suitable quantity of this specular ore to meet such demand rather than make a trifling shipment such as this, from elsewhere. The amount we shall ship depends entirely upon the demand, frcci time to time, of our clients, the paint-makers, and we cannot enter into any guarantee as to how much they will require, as this is a matter entirely beyond our control and in view of the specialised nature of the article, one we cannot with any accuracy foresee. The Sheik must therefore rely upon the fpct that his and our interests are identical in the matter and that in our own interest we shall ship as much as we can get rid of, subject, of course, to its quality being as good as is obtainable elsewhere. In view of the approaching conclusion of the seasons operations and consequent departure of Commander Rainier/Painier for home, I should be much obliged if the matter may be dealt with by Air Mail.

Dear Sir, With reference to your call at this Office this morning, I 'beg to enclose herewith a passport in favour of your wife valid for travel in the British Empire, all countries in Europe, etc. and Iraq. It is understood that your wife intends to accompany you on your journey to Sharjah 'by cargo steamer. As you were verbally informed at this Office the passport granted to your wife does not give permission to land at any part of the Arab Coast. The question whether she will be permitted to disembark at any port on the Arab coast is a matter entirely within the discretion of the local authorities. In regard to your own passport, which is also enclosed herewith, it will be seen that neither an endorsement nor visa for Sharjah has been affixed thereto. Nevertheless, the passport is in order for your proposed journey and in the meantime a communication is being made to the authorities at Sharjah in order to facilitate your landing. As no endorsement has been made to your passport the sum of 2/~ which you paid at this Office this morning is returned herewith in the form of a postal draft. Yours faithfully, Sgd. J.W.

Folio number 139 has been paginated in error so that it has the number 139 on its recto and 140 on its verso. The next folio has the number 141, meaning that folio 140 does not exist in this volume. The foliation sequence resumes at number 141 and continues through to number 208, which is the inside of the back cover of the volume. It should be noted that a letter sequence has been introduced to resolve an anomaly in the foliation sequence: previously, the number 43 was used to denote three separate folios; this sequence now reads as 43, 43A, and 43B. The foliation sequence is written in pencil in the top right corner of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>This file is a collection of correspondence between British officials in London, Delhi, Bushire, Bahrain, Sharjah and Teheran over the rights to mine red oxide on Abu Musa, an island in the Gulf claimed by Sharjah. The main correspondents are: India Office, Whitehall (John Gilbert Laithwaite); Shaikh Sultan bin Saqar of Sharjah; Political Resident Persian Gulf (Trenchard Craven Fowle); Political Agent, Bahrain (Gordon Loch); Senior Naval Officer Persian Gulf; Hajji Yusuf Kanoo (trader in Bahrain); Commander R.C. Bayldon; the Iranian Minister for Foreign Affairs.The correspondence relates to a contract for the mining of red oxide on Abu Musa. British officials helped facilitate the completion of the contract although the Iranians claimed the island as their territory and raised objections to the issuance of the contract. The final contract specified that Commander Bayldon will pay a minimum of 2000 Rupees a year in royalties to the Shaikh of Sharjah. The British warned Commander R.C. Bayldon that as it becomes known to the Iranians that he has taken rights to mining on Abu Musa that he will be barred from the higher quality Hormuz ore mines. The file includes a letter from the Political Resident Persian Gulf with a list of islands in the Persian Gulf 'known or presumed to contain Ferric Oxide'. The file is mostly in English with some letters in Arabic.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Senior Naval Officer in the Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Yusuf bin Ahmed Kanoo</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Robert Corbett Bayldon</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Abu Musa Island</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Persia</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Ferric oxide</topic></subject><subject><topic>Mining</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0000ed#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
