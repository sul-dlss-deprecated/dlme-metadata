Your telegram No. 675. Traffic is not passing through British hanks in Iraq who will not accept Bank of England notes. The only other handling channels are Bank of Rome and Kazilka and I have not been able to obtain evidence as yet that notes are being transmitted to Palestine through them. .1 strongly suspect however that notes are being smuggled to Palestine by travellers especially grain cattle and gold dealers and possibly by lorry drivers. . I am enquiring further into this matter. Discount for notes in Bagdad has increased from 10% to 13%. Well informed source in close touch with Tehran recently told^fet^^- Bank Bagdad that he had heard that notes were reaching Iran from the Balkans in diplomatic bags or by safe hands thus confirming Bucharest report. It°may well be that similar means are being used for sending notes to areas where they are still legal tender especially India and Palestine.• I see little hope of stopping the passage of notes through Iraq but perhaps it would be^possible for Palestinian authorities to oblige holders to register notes at present in circulation with a view xo preventing smuggled notes from entering into circulation.

I should be grateful for your observations and for any suggestions as to how traffic could be stopped. In view of low rate of discount for these notes in Iraq banks concerned must we feel have some simple means of getting notes to areas when they are legal tender (if notes were sent to United States for instance rate of discount would be much higher). Can you throw any definite light on this? Repeated to Jerusalem No, 1501 and Government of India No. 8441,r Decypher. D, R. No. 211. IR'IITAL NO. 2.
