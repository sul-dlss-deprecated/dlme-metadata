The meeting was informed that a letter had been received from^ the Government ^ of India to the effect that Abdullah bin Bashid was not considered unfit to be an authorised exporter and was alleged by the Government of India to have taken up and exported his quota regularly. It was decided that the' Director of Customs be asked to check whether in fact Abdullah bin Hashid had been exporting his quota of foot;car. The Director of Customs produced a letter written by a, merchant in Mombasa to a Bahrain merchant saying that sugar, tea, piecegoods, coffee, and se e oil, c be exported to Kahrain from TT ombasa provided import permission from Bahrain jas given. It was decided that no iie-ort permission could be , given^for cuo-ba articles but tliat enquiry might be made by tiie Political Agent from the Government of Kenya regarding the ' rules governing exports from Mombasa.

Mr. Devakishen also complained that, though shipping space had been allowed by the Export Trade Controller for the export of dhall on 3.3. ./osang and one other ship, the dhall had not been shipped.

The Political Agent raised the question of the price of footwear which he stated he thought was much in advance of prices in India. He was surprised to learn that the 25;e&gt; profit pennitted is chargeable not only on the actual cost of the goods plus import charges but actually on the import duty itself. 3. Merchants stated that the continued Shamals in the Basra Liwa had resulted in the drying up of a percentage of the dates with the result that they anticipated a reduction on last yea^s crop figures of some 30 to 50 per cent of all kinds of dates. 4. Merchants stated that owing to the fact that shipping space would not be available before the spring of 1945 they desired export permits for wood from Calicut to be for the first quarter of 1945. 1.

Haji Abdul ^.ziz Ali al Bassam requested permission to export 40,000 Saudi Rials to Kuwait. This permission ms refused. 3. Mr. Hussain Yateem informed the meeting that he had just received 100 motor car batteries from the United States of America and asked whether, in view of the new ruling that one- third of the batteries imported with assistance might no longer be given to the merchants for disposal outside Bahrain, he might be allowed to retain one-third of the batteries for 'free sale” in Bahrain. On the matter being discussed the Director of Customs gave it as his opinion that since the price of batteries was controlled in Bahrain permission could not be given to any individual merchant to sell at beyond the controlled price. He further pointed out that there was an acute shortage of batteries in Bahrain but it was agreed that when more batteries arrive and the present position is allevi ated Mr. Yateem 1 s request will be reconsidered and if possible an export permit granted for such batteries as were surplus to local requirements. 4. Mr. Devkishen informed the meeting that Indian merchants were at present engaged in buying dry dates in Saudi Arabia for export to India and that they were having difficulty in obtaining export permits from Bahrain for silver rupees. He was informed' that^ as this trade in no way affected Bahrain it could not be seen why stocks of silver coinage in Bahrain should be reduced to meet the merchants* requirements^ He was advised that merchants engaged in this trade should bring up their own silver coinage from India. 5. Haji Abdul Aziz Ali al Bassam informed the meeting that 95 tons of cement from Massawa had arrived and that another 280 tons were on the way. 6o Mr. Ashraf requested that his stock of XM.

The Director of Customs brought up the question of the quota of dhall allotted to Haji Abdul Aziz Ali al Bassam and said that information has just been received that the Export Trade Controller, Karachi, had^forbidden the export. On examining the papers, Major Hickinbotham gave it as' his opinion that this refusal was based on the fact that the quarter for which the quota had been allotted had expired before shipment was effected.' He agreed however to ask the Export Trade Controller what were the facts of the case. 2. Provision of Dollar exchange for imoorts from united 3tate_s of nmerica . Mr. Ashraf informed the neeting that he had informa tion from the Eastern Bank that merchants who succeeded in obtaining acceptances of orders in the United States of America would be provided with dollars to cover their orders by the reserve Bank of India. 3. Motor Car socme aw'-s . Haji Khalil bin Bbrahim Kanoo was asked what the position was with regard to export of spare parts for motor cars from India. He replied that the Ford Company in India would not give him parts'as he was an agent operating in Ford's_ Middle Eastern area. This area had nothing to do with India. He was therefore having to look for the pares in many oifferent firms. He was advised by Major Hickinbotham to wire the Ford agents in India informing them that he had a permit to export Ford parts from India and requesting their co-operation in the matter. 4. Peoner and Turmeric quotas . Mr. Devakishen informed the meeting that his firm's quotas for turmeric and pepper had been refused export. It was agreed to look into the matter.

Motor Car spare parts from India . The question of obtaining motor car spare parts for Bahrain was discussed in the light of a letter received from the Adviser to the Bahrain Government containing a report of a meeting between the Bahrain merchants principally affected. The merchants had stated that it was practically impossible to obtain spare parts in the open market in India and requested that such portions of their quotas as remained unpurchased should be cancelled and that shipping space be allotted in future for direct shipments from the U.8.A. It was pointed out to Haji Khalit bin Ebrahim Kanoo that it was extremely unlikely that motor cars or any large consignments of spare parts v/ould be released from America, at any rate before the end of 1945, and that for the present efforts should be made to obtain as much as possible from India. Haji Khalit bin Ebrahim Kanoo informed the meeting that the Ford Agents in India had said that they were unable to sell him spare parts as the sale of such parts was controlled by the Government of India. He was advised to reply that both export permits and purchasing permits.for the parts had been issued by the Govern ment of India so that presumably the objection of the Ford Agency in India was invalid. He said that he would get in jQD touch with his agents to see whether they had purchasing per mits and would advise them to take these permits to the Ford Agents. If the Ford Agents still refused to sell the matter could be taken up with the Government of India. 2. Release of Swiss Franks by the Reserve Bank of India . Mr. Ashraf informed the meeting that the Eastern Bank had just received orders from the Reserve Bank that no more Swiss Franks could be allowed for purchases in Switzerland. Unfortunately several merchants had consignments which had been ordered and which were actually on the way before this new order of the Reserve Bank was known. He wanted to know what financial arrangements could be made to cover the payment of such orders. It was agreed that on a consolidated list of such consignments being produced and given to the Bank, in the event of a refusal to provide Swiss Franks efforts would be made to secure the release of enough currency to cover the shipments already on the way. • 3. Tallow shipments from India . Haji Khalil bin Ebrahim Kanoo said that the Export Trade Controller had refused to allow the shipment of tallow from India for which he had been given«,recommendation. It was agreed to re-approach the Export Trade Controller. 4. Bran. Mr. Devakishen told that his quota of bran which hadbeen allotted for shipment in August had been stopped by the Bxport Trade Controller, He was advised to ta zq tne matter up with the Director of Customs who had allotted the quota and on receipt of the Director of Customs 1 re port action would be taheh.
