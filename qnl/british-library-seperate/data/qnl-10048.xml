Most of the papers consist of correspondence between various British Political Agents in Kuwait and Bahrain, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, the India Office, and the British Legation at Jeddah. The papers discuss the British governments position with regards to exploring for oil in the Arabian Peninsula and Persian Gulf region with the view to securing as many contracts as possible for British firms as the region became increasingly visible to international oil companies after the discovery of oil in Bahrain in 1932.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Contract law</topic></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Eastern and General Syndicate Limited, oil company</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Legation to Saudi Arabia</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Petroleum</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0000f5#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
