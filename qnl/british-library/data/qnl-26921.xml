Al Zi iY.AiL a APB 1958 'ft ^ 7 APR 1958 Dear Sir, Would you kindly refer to your letter of the 31st March, regarding your desire to obtain information concerning the coinage of Muscat and Oman etc. So far as Muscat and Oman is concerned I am afraid that my enquiries do not enable me to add to the information which has already been sent to you by the Department of Overseas ^ y™- Trade, and it would^beja waste of/time to come and see me. I would, however, suggest that you should communicate direct with His Majesty 1 s Consul at Muscat, who is in the best position ih*y {u*#**4 to answer y&amp;rrr enquiries^ k 'C«.$c k \r^s ccrv^ 5^ \Y v.€Aa\r U3' W&gt;&gt; Cvo^ SVnX. ^ ^ C^^Vvn€^Ac'^ Can ^Y&amp;vy, % (Sgd.) A. C. B, SYMOW.M. COMENCINI 100 Riveredale Road COLLIER ROW ROMFORD ESSEX ROf^FORD March 51 st 1958 A, C. B. SYMON Esq. India Office, Whitehall, LONDON S.W.l Dear Mr Symon I have been favoured with your address by the De^traent of Overseas Trade and I now take the liberty to ask you kindly for an appointment at some time suitable to you. I wish first of all to express my sincere thanks for whatever help you may see your way to grant me in my quest for positive information concerning the coinage of Muscat and Onan and, if possible of a few amongst the Indian Native States. I am now engaged in working out a book, or rather a catalogue of coins covering the period 1789 to 1869 and in trying to make as complete as possible a supplement to my book 'Coins of the Modem World 1870 - 1956’ 1 . These boo/cs ai e intended on the same line^as the postage stamp catalogues, A to be of service to coin collectors, whose numbers are not, in my opinion as large as they might very well be; to give them at least a certain idea as to which coins are to be considered as rarities and which not; as to which coins, especially are decidedly common and should not be paid for at unduly high prices. Awaiting the pleasure to hear from you, with my renewed thanks, I remain, with all due deference, Yours faithfully,v mm The currency of Oman is the Maria Theresa dollar or riyal, and the debased copper coin minted in 1895 to the order of the Sultan. The Indian rupee also circulates, and copper pice are imported from India, Zanzibar, and German East Africa. Sovereigns and British coins are also current in Muscat and Matrah, but in the interior these coins are exchanged at a discount. The rate of exchange between the Maria Theresa dollar and the rupee varied in the year 1912 from 141Rs. 8a. (£9 7s. 4d.) to 152Rs. (£10 2s. 8d.) per 100 dollars, the lowest being in April and the highest in October; in 1913 it varied from 145Rs. 8a. (£9 14s.) to 154Rs. 8a. (£10 6s.). The instability of the silver exchange occasions many shipments of specie between Muscat and Bombay, and is unfavourable for trade.(2008/710) Wt28388/478/46783 5,000 11/37 i'HD Gp683 Referense D.O.T. &amp; /&lt;9 f \X^ r &amp;&gt; 19 THE Comptroller-General of the Department of Overseas Trade V A* ^ presents his compliments to le Departmei /r / M- ^ ^ r&gt; and transmits herewith copy of the undermentioned paper for information and retention.
