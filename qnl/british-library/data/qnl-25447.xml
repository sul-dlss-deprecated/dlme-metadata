I have receiied the news of* your safe arrival et your O.Q. and your capital for which I thank Ood. I really felt very sorry for your long absence, as your pre sence is, oy his Grace, the source of great blessing. Though your Officers did their best in their respective duties yet your j•: st information and interest is the greater source of our pleasure at this occasion. We are very anxious to have the honour of seeing your honour as there is much good therein, iirsuly foi tme sake of seeing your goodself and secondly to talk over meny matters concerning the general welfare; but as I am here and am busy in doing what concerns the general welfare 1 therefore pay more heed to the most important task. I further beg to state that I am doing my level best in maintaining peace, security and affording facilities of all kinds and, by His Grace, shall attain the object. Because after your departure there appeared something 'diich I was afraid could give rise to some unpleasant circumstances but I exerted my utmost in exterminating the mischiefs. By the Grace of God end the assistance of the British Government the matters would stand as desired. I thought it enough to reply to Mr. Philby. Really he did the full justice to the duty. I am very thankful to him as in your absence I was quite satisfied with what I saw in him of his interest in the- 2 - \ y British Government and his familiarity -ith the circumstances traos. jo it has been the source of gratitude to him and reliance upon him after God. Certainly it will end most admirably if throw* his stay with us the fire of mischiefs is extinguished and the public welfare is secured. I should ^ ike to stwte here the question of these wicked mischievous AJMH and SHliR about whom you must have heard enoueh and i. rail by might have reported to your honour about their transgressions and intrigues. At present Abdul Rahman Bin Mamar my deputy is at Zubair in your service and shall report to your honour all what would happen. It is necessary that through their intrigues our interior matters may suffer by some mischiefs, the end of which may prove unpleasant. 3o I beg to invite your special attention towards this. You may either rooe it out by stopping them from oppression in future a.nc. punishing them tor the past or allow us please so that we and our tribes may pay them in their own com or give us help, as we have asked Hr. Philby, with a strong and sufficient forces, wnich may check their transgressions and actions against/ om o r i b 0 s a no put an snci to ohsm intripuGs Tr hidh aiic-cc oui interior a_lairs. _-o I hop© that your honour would take up the matter soon and arrange for speedy remedy. In the end I congratulate your honour at this auspicious return and trust you would not stoo riving us necessary information and lettinw us know of your welfare and the victories of the British Government and its allies. Ti1 or other news I content with • the information of my friend as I have stated above. That is what to be laid before your honour, hay you long live./ In the name of God, merciful and compacsionate 'ission. Dated ^2nd Dhi Qadah ±336 (30/6/1918) Dejaz and you forwarded the same to His Britannic Imperial Majesty the King Dmperor, telegraphically through the Baghdad Government and you have been kind enough to state to us that the transgressions on our frontier but after consideration and December 1915. Surely vre know it for certain that the Briuish Government out of her justice and our sincerety with her, does not like the least transgression (upon us) and we strongly trust upon God and afterwards upon this; but the matter, owing to the movements which are well known to you and which are affecting our internal affairs, is grave and serious. By His Grace we have not left to stop them or to t/ take to the means of stopping them, for any weakness (in us) or want of means. It is rather for the regard of the interests of the British Government', otherwise by His Power and strength their stoppage is the easiest possible thing for us and that is what we covet for, had there not been the regard of the British Government and the difficulties in this way ad I have you had been entrusted by the Government to put before us the following six problems instead of those which had already been laid before. 1 Readiness of the British Government to prevent : discussion as we agreed upon it in our agreement datedalready informed yourself a/ram. ^jnich it is needless to reoeat second problem is that Kina; Hussein, Sherif 01 ^ t-'Cca, has .’i/en to you the strongest possible securities that his action against the hostile Sheikh Khalid Bin Lowi Ameer of Khazma is a local one and his attack is not at all directed against us who have got not the least fear of trans gression on the boundaries* So I request you that this point is extremely difficult as I have already told you of the matter of Khaled Bin Lowi and his country and the oppress sion of the Sherif against him who has not mot the least reason against him either religious or geographical and that is what you might have gathered from my verbal answer to you and from the letters of Ibn-i-Lowi and from the letter of Prince Abdulla, the son of the Sherif. So if the matter is not settled in favour of the safety of the said Khalid and the security of his country and that there would not be the least transgression upon him, then the matter is that firstly I would never agree with it at all and secondly if by force, I like to agree, all the Arabs would stand, against for the preservation of their religion and their worldly interests and they would not care even if I and you both join against them and thus there will be troubles and disturbances which can never pass in your mind and cannot be imagined. Moreover I haw/e concluded some coldness from these words or the fact is that some of the Government Officers have not understood the meaning of the Sherif and his claim that it is a 'voice of truth' while he, the Sherif, wants to serve, with this, his own personal interests. So if any transgression, from the Sherif, will take place upon the people of Khazma, after their being given securities by us and by yourself, then I will not be responsible for anything that may happen. 3, The third problem is that the Sherif Hussein out of his good wishes for the welfare, is determined to send a letter to me and the British Government considers it goodg u -3- and that the Sherif has informed you that His I'ajestv are ready to come to see me for discussing about t}^settlement c~4.xe.iio. do as regards the welfare-and the exertion :or this it is well known to your honour that at all times I have been doing my level best and exerting my whole energies for this end and this is my aim and desire and I am fully prepared upon having all the matters between me and the Sherif of Hecca and the Arab .Sheikhs amicably settled and I shal- co r.y oest as long as it does not interfere with my religion and dignity. As regards His Uajc-sty the Sherif' 6 readiness to come to see me, I am grateful and much obliged to His Majesty for this but His Majesty's coming out would require prepara- tions and there will be certain difficulties therein and at the same time there will be trouble as I am afraid His Majesty in reality would not be able to move among the people of Khazma and others with liberty and will meet with difficulties which will be experienced as before. • But if His Majesty comes out in peace and safety and in the company of the Government Officers who are well acquainted wish the circum stances and are just and do understand the situation very well so I shall be ready to be present in any place they may appoint in the parts of Mej eel. * ^ cw :j c,rds tne iourth problem, the question of the Government and her being prepared not’to let any contention take place between the parties and for the removal of the difficulties between us and she considers the matter a difficult one during this war and it is essential for all the Arab Sheikhs to join together against their common enemy patiently and calmly and should exert their utmost in this way so I take it as one of the greatest duties. No doubt some of the Arab Sheikhs, owing to their personal doubts and their knowledge that no consideration or discussion can entitle them to have right to certain objccts wnich they want to achieve, they.- 4 - 4 in order to get at some objects when the Government is engsgea, put in some difi iculties and do some incrimues. But i have, By His Grace, great .rust in your previous and laoter treaties. The first treaty was made by Mr. Bailey vith my Grand i Ether, dheikh Faiss.l and the second one was made by Sir Percy Cox, the Political Officer, with me. All that what belonged to my father and forefathers in the past hcs been inherited to me. I do not want anything more than that and by the Will of God and that of yourself I am quite ready for discussion if you want. r ost of my testimonies and evidences are based uoon your sketches end maos 'Poich ere in your hands. If the matter is to be postponed till the end, oi trie war, then, I am prepared to stop myself and my tribes from the transgression on the condition .hat you would prohibit all the transgressors among your allies and your subjects from all sorts of transgressions on my boun daries and on my subjects and you would give perfect secu rities. At the end of the war after consideration and discussion if they have got more of my lands under them you would hand it over to me and if I have got theirs you may give it to them and we shall give up all disputes at once and you are surities upon this. As regards the 5th problem re. the blockade arrangements you know it for certain that it is my duty to explain to you the difficulty wMch may fall in your way from my side and therefore I must tell you the way which may afford you comfort and facility and cut off the interests of the enemy. So if you would take them up and do as I asked you to do, then, I am andxif ready to help you and if you would not accept then I have already explained to you what was essential and it.is for you to think over is. As regards the 5th problem that the Government gives perfect securities that no material loss will be sus tained by me in connection with my undertakings, I undertake0 for facilitating your military interests, I have already expiained to you al1 th3 difficu11ies. T oreoever th6 policy- v/hich I used with the people of Shimr and Hail was to the end oi prevailing upon them easily and by and by; our as I hearc. your discourse and saw your earnest desire to stand against the common enemy I -ave up my policies ana ..y inoeresos foi* your sake and now I am, by His n-ra.ee, prepared to fight against the enemy; and the comolete preparations, which I hope, by the help of Hod, and your- sell I will be able to make, Tr dll be more than you stated. You know it well that all my internal and external losses and‘expenses are mostly incurred in your interests as I told you verbally. You know it well that had it not been for the verification of what I said and for-the interests of both the parties neither I myself nor my forces and nor my sons would have been in this place. I have already told you what needs not any repetition.r rom; io: Dated —'ddul xi.7,iz _jl Baud, r’uler of Deled ^ a °i : am iDs dependencies and their tribes.

Your Kajesty, I o:::er my best compliments and peroetual prayers and inquiring after Jfour Majesty's dignified dis position (may Your Majesty be always in the host enjoyment of health and happiness) I be- to inform your Majesty of our welfare. I have had the honour Of the receipt of your much esteemed letter and understood its contents, ihougn there were some words which were written bv You. 1 ' iviajcsty aid not suit well yet for ohe present common inoeiesu we accept all that comes from Your hajesty. In these days have received news from the ministers of the Great Government informing us that they are doing cheir level best for our welfare as the contention is harmful. to all both the subjects, enemies and allies. Your majesty . must oe aouoting as to my having hand in the matter of the people of Kliazma and that am inducing them but by Ibrahim, and rohammed, I am with the public and with your Majesty, against them. Then ever they come to me they combi ain about their religious problem; . but I tell them this is not the propter occasion for suchftalk. Then the Sabi’ received the note from your son, Abdulla, who stated to them in his letter, which is now with me, that you had left the path of huetafa (prophet) and had followed the sect of Abdul Wahab, they and all the people of Nejed became sure that Your Majesty -ere going to mislead them from their religion. When they read the letters uo me, I told them that they had nothing to to with this. Religion is of God, and it is neither ours nor Sherif’s. I checked them as far as I could till your detachments ran over them twice and happened -hat happened,. Your Yajestyl f r ay Your2 Majesty live Iona) I have hur.bled myself and have explained vhsu is roo( for me and. four hajesty in particular and for om suDjecus ano che allies. There is no idea, of she rasonief s Deinm useful go i our ! ajesty and the present mis miefs are sure to rive rise so sone hidden evil s mhich may cause rreat trouble both from the subjects and the enemies. tom I wish to express to Your Tajesty an idea. As regards myself please trust G-od the trouble will be removed if I have power to check it and I like what is like a by lour majesty. As regards the Ehazma people I think Your majesty may'wrise a lesser to Khalid and all the people of the Wadi statins: therein that the matters have stood amainst what it was thought about, them and that I and you and I bn 3eud are ell one age inst the enemy and now everyone should look to his^religion without any interferen ce. The mischief is spreading between you and our tribes. As regards the tribes of Hedjaz, I, the Sheriff am responsible^ for them and as regards the neiec Tribes Ion Saud is their guarantee fill the end of War. When the war is over the truth and Sharia 1 will be spread among the Allies and the masters shall be formotten. I promise you, God is my witness, I shall do my best to help you in extinguishing the whole mischief, haminw your internal and' external administration and'political interests. Let the mischiefs bo extinguished, the enemy be disappointed. If there is any dispute or discussion among us through the previous or latter strangeness so it is between us, ' you and the gracious Government and nobody else knows it.” So owing to our friendship with your 11ajesty and desire for peace annihilation of -the enemies, I have written this letter and have left all the previous regards. I doubt not that your l ajesty's sagacity and policy woulc, lead to wel fare, and friendship That is what had to you would convey my from me and my sons. as it is becoming of your Majesty, be explained to Your 11 ajesty and hope best compliments to your noble sons 1' ay Your 11 aj esty live long.TgANSLATIOK . -7 Z,t/ z?7 V As regards the question of the written treaties rnieh I have already submitted to your honour at Biyaz and laid the seme before His Imperial Majesty the Kina dmperor telegraphically through the Baghdad Government, I have the honour to state to your honour that the Government has entrusted me to submit to you the following written treaties instead of the previous ones. • i * Government is prepared to exert her whole energy is pumcing an end to all the transgressions on the boundaries of Ibn Sa’dun however it considers it impossible to cecide finally every problem separately as it ouaht to oe uill t.ne boundary lines of his dominions ere fixed after aiscus si on; a,s we agreed upon in our agreement of the month of December 1915. ^'ing Hussein has given us the strongest security that his attack on the Sheikh (hostile), Khajid Bin Luwi, Ameer of Khazma, is a local one, and,he has no mind to attack Ibn Sand who has not got the least idea of his running over his boundaries. G* The King Hussein is determined to send a. friendly letter to Ibn Baud and he seems to be exerting for the welfare of both the parties and the British Government considers it in the good of the parties and all the Arabs cUio tne King Hussein liras informed us that he is willing to come to see Ibn Saud to discuss with him on the settlement of affairs, 4. The British Government is prepared to accord its best help to the parties for the settlement of their affairs and to remove the difficulties in their ways in the best mannef. However the Government considers it impracticable in these war times which are full of troubles to have.the intricate claims be finally settled satisfactorily to both the parties -say determination of boundaries and the like. During these times it is necessary for all the Arab Chiefs to join against their common enemy calmly and patiently—2 - Z'z! ana should exert their energies to dirrinidh the troubles ^riich fall in their wav. •/ * ' 7e are prepared to arrange for the blockade i ]l a T£ y ^ rn i G h aay satisfy I bn Saud and if we are unable Lo P'^ri°rm P'le task, ibn laud would not be responsible for any export made to the enemy. D * Ihe British Government gives every satisfaction snu security that no material loss will be sustained bv him xnd if he would join them, to afford facilities in the advancement of their militarv interests. 20 Dhi Qadah ln36, (28/8/1916).

King of the Hedjaz reports Ikhwan have attacked Shakers main supply base at Dghadjah, about 45 miles nntth of Taj.f, and captured 400 sacks of food and other booty. He states that this aggression so close to his capital will precipitate a crisis which can only be prevented by urgent representations to Bin Baud. He suggests that an ultimatum be addressed to the latter by Ills Majesty’s Government requiring dispersal witnin a period of thirty-five days of various Xkhwan concentra tions: particularly those at Ghub, Arbawich. (group undecypheralle) Utny and Perthian ~ and prev r enuio^i c communications by Ateiba to those places* If His Majesty's Government (? is) unable to support- him in this way he must disclaim all further responsible, and will have no alternative but to withdraw (i.e. abdicr'c . Colonel Wilsoite comments on above arc that Ikhwan activity is undoubtedly on the increase and that the sendingsending of re-inforeements mentioned in my telegram No.1765 is only one of several indications that Bin Sand is behind it. He refers to opinion expressed in his memorandum enclosed with despatch No. 33 of May 7th to you and submits that time has come for adoption by His Majesty’s Government of 15 suzerainty policy' in ff/our of King Hussein and for despatch of an injunction to Bin Baud immediately to withdraw all Ikhwan troeps from the neighbourhood of Khorma. He considers there are good grounds for King’s fear of spread of insidious Wahabite influence in the Hedjaz and thinks that it is proballe that Abdullah and his troops will proceed to Khorma after surrender of Medina, In his view dangers to King’s prestige and to peace of the Hedjaz justifies military opposition to Ikhwan penetration. Tension between Sheree and Wahabites is evidently increasing and a collision appears imminent. No attempt at arbitration is likely to succeed and on ground of political expediency we must I consider support King Hussein, If it were possible at this juncture to inform Bin Baud that King^s claim to priority without prejudice to territorial rights of other Arab Chiefs had diplomatic support of His Majesty’s Go vernment it might dispose Bin Baud to avoid taking the field in person; and knowledge that such announcement h: ♦ been made to his rival would be a strong inducement to King to exercise patience.

(Addressed to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India; repeated to the British High Commissioner, Egypt.) On receipt of Secretary of State’s two telegrams* of August 2nd, Philby . , .. J wroteunderdate August 18th as follows:— Extract begins. Firstly, after careful con- sideiation have decided to defer conciliatory message until His Majesty’s Gov- g jjo 8 ernment have considered my reportf of June 25th and subsequent correspondence. Delivery of such message if followed by His Majesty’s Government’s summary decisiont that Khurma falls outside sphere t Serin 1 No. 35. . , . , . . ,. j* ti ^ , F- iu which intervention of Ibn 8aud is warranted would but create suspicion in his mind regarding our impartiality. Please await my letter (group undecypherable) which deals exhaustively with crse. Request that I may then receive definite orders regarding delivery and exact form of message. Meanwhile situation continues steady as far as Ibn Saud concerned owing to His Majesty’s Government’s original message§ and I have found him 5 tna °' ‘ extremely accommodating. For this reason consider it impolitic to disturb his tranquility until His Majesty’s Government have had full opportunity to consider case in all bearings. Secondly, venture to think (that) His Majesty’s Government will revise opinion based on distance of Khurma from Taif. As already pointed out Khurma is only ten miles east of the unquestionable boundary of Euqum and Subai tribes, namely, Shaib Shaba. Question at issue therefore is jurisdiction over western section of Subai tribe whose Capital is Khurma and whose eastern boundary is Wadi Naim one hundred and twenty miles east of Khurma. Adjudication of Khurma to Sheriff therefore necessarily implies extending boundary of Hedjaz to line about two hundred miles or more (of) Taif. Tms brings up question of Ataiba highlands extending another one hundred miles eastwards of W'adi Naim and as Sheriff claims jurisdiction over Ataiba the boundary of Najd falls back very nearly to .line Tuwaiq.! 101 I earnestly represent, firstly, that matter is far more complicated than is supposed and has two sides ; secondly, that Ibn Sand cannot abandon Khurma to its fate without risking widespread disturbance of Naim tribes whose first act in any case would be to attack Sheriff with help of the Southern tribes; and, thirdly, that in any case Khurma will never submit to Sheriffian attacks while every unsuccessful attempt of Sheriff makes the feeling of Central Arabia increasingly unfavourable to us. According to my information considerable number of &gt; aim troops formerly serving in Sheriffs forces have come away owing to Sheriff’s atutude and hostility to Naim and (two groups undecipherable) Ataiba Sheikhs a» significant. Fourtblv, have never ceased to make (it) clear to Ibn Saud that owing to active participation in war and general political considerations His Majesty s Government will not suffer any prejudice in Sheriff s interests. At same time have made terms clear His Majesty’s Government will without fail protect Ibn Saud(’s) legitimate interest(s). He asks for no more than that and as already frequently reported is ready to submit all disputable matters to British Gov ernment on above basis. At same time he is determined to surrender none of his legitimate claims to aggression by Sheriff. Venture to submit that no exception can be taken to above attitude and that this proved m various ways culminating in his letter to Sheriff, sincerity(?) of his desire lor peaceful solution. Extract ends. 78 Telegram R., No. 7419, dated the 7th (received 8th) September 1918. From— The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Baghdad, 'Pq Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla, (Addressed to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India; repeated to the British High Commissioner, Egypt.) Philbv writes, August Begins. Regarding suggestion* to divert Ibn Sand’s attention have had that * senai No 43 . purpose in mind for long time and have come to following conclusions :— (1) That Khurma affair has gone too far and created too much feeling among people of Naim to put forward any satisfactory solution other than imposition of mutual hands off policy on both sides for period of war. Am perfectly convinced that even if I bn Saud can be persuaded to hold aloof, renewal of attacks on Khurma will result in widespread conflagration which once started will be impossible to control. Turks in Asir and Madina and Ibn Rashid can scarcely fail to profit by such situation. (2) Assuming above settlement of Khurma trouble, it is always possible that some petty event or other of Badawin life will raise Ataiba problem or that of boundary generally and am convinced that it is desirable to divert Ibu Sand’s attention from such matters. Nevertheless am convinced that mere gift of money or profit (able) land would not serve the purpose as such gift would still leave him idle. In any case doubt if he would accept gift of land in Mesopotamia and primd fade (?) doubt wisdom of introducing Wahabi elements into country. (3) In my opinion real activity is only panacea for ills arriving from natural indolence of life of the Arabs and this conclusion I have kept steadily in view in connection with the proposed operations against Hail. With limited resources at my disposal I have not been able to do very much hut have felt naturally reluctant to abandon Hail offensive. Nevertheless, had it not been for such dispositions as I have been able to make no changes would ha^ e been ready to direct, diversion o consequent upon first attack on Khurma, O4 As it is coming offensive has been God-send as mobilisation at worst enabled 8 (?) Ibn Sand to collect his forces and to keep them content bv regular tranquility and in direct control. Unfortunately the money laid out in this venture will not last for ever and at present cannot say how long mobilisation will hold good. I am well acquainted with reality of having nothing to fall back on but am emboldened by His Majestv , s Govern- • Serial No 53 ment’s present views* to * reopen th« subject. Feel perfectly confident can keep large force actively employed in operations against Hail and neighbourhood if Government can place more arms and money at my disposal and my proposals (are) as follows: Firstti/.—As regards artillery am of opinion that owing to loss of tim* for training no guns can be used. Secondly .—As regards small arms would request that 5,000 rifles of good type with corresponding ammunition be sent to Koweit to be given out by Political Agent on my requisition. Essential that Ibn Saud and his Koweit agents should know nothing of this. I would propose to let him have 1,000 at once and to give out the rest in the event of Sheriffian crisis, practically as bribes for inaction in that direction. Thirdly .—Money is all important as Ibn Saud cannot keep his forces actively (in ?) field, without feeding them. Would suggest, therefore, that either I be given monthly allotment of £ 10,000 or that I be allowed to draw at discretion on Koweit up to total maximum of 50,000 pounds up to the end of December. Essential that allotment be to me and not to Ibn Saud as can then count on getting good value. Finally, trust that above proposals will receive favourable consideration. In anticipation of acceptance in principle am asking Political Agent, Koweit, to supply 3,000 bags rice, 200 coffee, 200 sugar to Ibn Sand’s agent from the stores held by him and debit it to the Mission. Have told Ibn Saud to send for above on understanding that he will have to pay for them in due course. Kindly sanction the issue. Trust may receive early reply to this. Am handing over 3,0t 0 bags rice, 200 coffee to Abdullah Nafisi, no sugar available. Am charging cost price plus 10 to cover godown rent. Finds. My comment follows.

I do not think friction should be caused as Nafisi can at any time tell us if auy sort of obstruction takes place. Present trade arrangements are as follows— Nothing is .to be exported from India to Koweit without pass signed by McCollum or myself. Political Officers at Gulf ports are taking such executive action as possible to prevent unduly large exports to Koweit. Our permits are issued :— ,(1) Monthly up to requirements of Koweit and its tribes. (2) On production of receipt from Basraii or other Customs showing that goods manifested by sea from Koweit have actually arrived. (3) On vouchers from Nafisy that caravan of Bin Saud has taken such and such quantities. (4) To merchants desiring to import new stocks on their giving acceptable guarantee to produce evidence of arrival at unobjec tionable destination. No exports are allowed by land except by Shaikh for Koweit tribes, by Najd caravans vouched for by Nafisi and by caravans if any beariug pass signed by Iraq Political Officers, which has to be presented to us. Arrangement is based on trust of Shaikh and in view of fright Shaikh and Koweit public have received over turning away of caravans and Zayani, ,, is likely to work satisfactorily for the present. If arrangement fails diversion of Najd traffic to Bahrain might be carried out in addition to any other punitive action Government might decide to take but I would deprecate doing so till then. I understand Bin Saud suspicious both of Shaikh and of us hut it must be remembered that had he exercised effective control over his eastern territory from the beginning our task here would have been a comparatively light one. At the same time it seems essential to take some action ourselves to show Bin Saud that we intend to support him, to restore our name in the eyes of the Arabs, who undoubtedly look upon withdrawal of blockade as due to weakness and to keep alive present spirit of co-operation shown by Shaikh. To this end suggest that we should forthwith establish post at Safwan to guard water-supply filling up all wells not covered by post. Authorise Bin ? Saud to occupy Hafar. Arrange with Shaikh to occupy Safah : he has alreadySOO men at Jaharah. I should be authorised to inform Shnikh thnt if any further raiding party passes through Koweit territory we shall be forced to take aetion ourselves to prevent recurrence. You are best in position to judge what action should be taken regarding Ajman and Dkari but they are a constant source of trouble and have proved themselves unworthy of any regard; would it not be preferable to have them »pen enemies and harry them as such as soon as above action has been taken, which will enable us to meet raids.

Prom—The British High Commissioner, Egypt, Bacos, Ramleh, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart- ment, Simla. (Addressed to the Foreign Office ; repeated Baghdad, 1331.) I have no commeot on proposal in first sentence beyond reaffirming opinion expressed in my telegram,* 1209, August 12th, that in present circumstances sinews of war should he supplied to Ibn Saud only in minimum quantities necessary to retain his good-will and authority. Arab Bureau hand-book of Hedjaz was very hastily compiled and in absence of better information restricted Hedjaz eastern boundary to limits formerly effective to Turkish control. Since his succession to Emirate in 1909 Sheriff certainly exercised authority to east and I have already t semi No. 7&amp;. referred (see my telegramf No. 1308) to 1910 Treaty (concluded after a Sheriffial expedition to Quasim) under which Harb, Ataiba, Subai, Muteir tribesmen were relieved from taxation by either Ihn Saud or Ibn Bashid. It cannot therefore be said that Kburma had no connection with Sheriff’s jurisdiction prior to Arab revolt. His appointment of Khalid there as Emir as evidence to contrary and whatever we may think of his discretion in choosing present moment to assert this authority a glance at map showing situation of Khurma in bosom of Taif will explain why he could not be expected to disinterest himself in increase of Wahabite activity there. As regards last sentence of j semi No 73 . Government of India’a telegram^, I hope my telegrams have made it clear I do not advocate any unfair pressure or subordination of interests of Ibn Saud to those of King Hussain. At same time I submit that His Majesty’s Gov ernment are under far greater obligation to latter who at a critical time opposed Turkish jehad and joined the Allies and whose Northern Army is now actively co-operating with Egyptian Expeditionary Force. I have also assumed that general agreement by His Majesty’s Government in views expressed in my telegram§ 1209 implied a decision to support King’s present action without prejudice to any eventual settlement between him and Ibn Saud; and that they would be clearly informed of His Majesty’s Government’s decision.

Meanwhile have verbally translated message literally to Ibn Sand informing him would give him written copy in supersession of my provisional guarantee. He expressed himself gratified with clauses 5 and 6 and fully appreciates difficulties mentioned in 1 and 4 and anxiety of British Government amidst109 109 ffrGstcr cares of protection of interests of its Arab Allies. As regards expressed hope that letter of Sheriff will open up path to re-establish friendly relations and professes his readiness to meet him half way. Clause 2 he did not like and expressed hope Government would not allow any further attack on Khurma as it would reopen trouble among Najd tribes who have been temporarily pacified by his assurances. Incidentally he has just leceived another pressing letter from Khurma. He will probably give me written reply when I deliver message in writing but in general he expressed himself satisfied that in essentials Government’s message endorsed my guarantees except for clause raising (regarding?) Khurma and omission of mention of Shammar and Ajman which latter I assured him is local matter on which reference to His Majesty’s Government unnecessary but was receiving full consideration locally. Even since His Majesty’s Government’s first message* situation here has been easy. Storm was sudden and very * Serial No. 27 . sharp and not yet altogether over past as Shakir’s stupidity constitute lowering clouds on horizon. Sincerely trust that will not be allowed to develop. Another attack on Khurma will throw Najd again into ferment. Should be realised that vast majority of people spend more than half of their day in prayer and other religious exercises and should not be dealt with as fully reasonable beings. Their vision is hope lessly limited and their souls sour with fanaticism. If satisfactory arrange ment of Khurma difficulty can be arrived at prospect of re-establishment of good relations seems bright enough and if King serious about visit why not arrange meeting at Marran.

Salient points of reply are— (1) Reference clause 2—objects strongly to Sheriff being allowed to attack Khurma and points out that even if he withdrew the objection, people of Najd would not accept the position. Specifically disclaims responsibility for the consequences if matter allowed to go further. (2) Regarding Sheriff’s offer to visit him expressed appreciation and gratitude and readiness to meet the Sheriff but expresses fear that such expedi tion may be cover for collecting forces to divert subsequently to Khurma and desires conditions, firstly, that Sheriff should come with minimum of following necessary to maintain his(?) dignity, and secondly, that a responsible British Represen f ative should accompany him. After full consideration and in view of possible danger of clash if satis factory agreement not arrived at would on the whole recommend that the visit he not encouraged. Temper of Najd people is too uncertain and religiousdiscussion between the followers of the two rulers might result in disorder. * Enclosure No. 5 to Serial No. 79 . Under these circumstances recommend consideration of proposals in my M.-147,* August 8thj as affording best temporary solution. In this connection news arrived to-day that Shakir, who is concentrating at Marra, has issued orders for despatch of expedition to collect taxes from Ibn Humaid, a Ataiba chief who has paid taxes to Ibn Saud. Ibn Humaid has replied by going off with whole following to join people of Najd; also reported that people of Eanya, Tathlith, Bisha, &amp;c., have gathered in very large numbers at Khurma. Venture strongly to urge that this dangerous situation be not allowed to drag on indefinitelv. Shakir has very little prospect of success and there is very serious risk that his next failure will be followed by widespread religious outbreaks. Can not press matter in stronger terms than I have done. We are courting disaster by letting this fanaticism develop (and) as situation at present easy and I earnestly hope that advantage will be taken of the fact to impose temporary + Serial No. 84 abstinence on both parties alike.

That Ibn Sand should be kept as quiet as possible and should be restrained, if possible, from military activities or aggressive action in any direction is thought desirable in present military situation, by the military authorities here. Por this reason they are against encouraging him to attack Ibn Rashid at present juncture or increasing his armed strength. On military grounds, General Officer Commanding, Egypt, strongly supports this view, which also is accepted by His Majesty’s Government. The force of Philby’s plea for offensive against Hail as furnishing Ibn Saud with diversion is appreciated by us (reference my I! Serial No. 35. telegram,|| 2nd August). We consider that the balance of advantage lies in policy of marking time as recommended bv the military authorities apart from the fact that the capture of Hail might in itself precipitate rupture with King Hussain. Por the present in the circumstances, we cannot modify the decision not to supply 1,000 (group und.) rifles. That His Majesty’s Government regret that they do not at present see their way to replace the rifles already supplied, though they are much concerned to learn that they do not give satisfaction, should he explained to Ibn Saud by Philby. Ibn Baud’s requirements will, however, he borne in mind by them and at a later date may be met to some extent. &lt; Question of withholding 100 rifles as % senai No. 69. sanctioned by my telegram^f of the 28th August, is left to Your Excellency’s discretion.91 No. 17301-r-&gt;9-,2, dated Baghdad, the 23rd August 1918 (Secret).

In these letters which were sent by recipients to Ibn Saud (here follows gist as given by Philby) Your Highness will understand that Ibn Saud can only jegard such letters as directly inimical. His Majesty’s Government was fully satisfied with Your Highness’ assurance that Sheriff Shaker’s expedition to Khurma was merely to restore internal order and on receipt of it informed Ibn Saud of Your Highness’ friendly feelings towards him and at the same time urged him to adopt a similar conciliatory attitude. I am sure that you are ignorant of Sheriff Abdulla’s action in writing these letters, but you will see how critical matters have become since they have fallen into Ibn Saud’s hands. I strongly urge Your Highness to lose no time in writing both to Sheriff Abdulla and Sheriff Shaker relating to them how you have given your word to the British Government that no aggressive act will be committed against Ibn Saud or his followers, instructing the former to conform to your policy and devote his energies to fighting the Turks and ordering latter not to go beyond Khurma or to call a gathering of tribes which can only lead to bloodshed.

Ibn Saud is within his nominal rights and High Commissioner instructs you to inform King that Ibn Saud feels he is unable to allow extensive purchase of camels now and has, therefore, ordered purchasers sent by Abdulla to return with their money.

Meanwhile Philhy presses for action on lines of my * SemlNo - 44 - 6492* of August 7th, of which copy was sent him. Adds that Ibn Sand’s confidence would be restored if such action were taken by us.

Good British rifles can be purchased for cash from Sheriff’s adherents anywhere in Central Arabia and have recent ly found their way to Bushire hinterland. It is not so easy to come by ammunition but of this 150,000 rounds, enough for 1000 rifles, have been sanctioned (a* ?) though vide my telegram|^ of the 17th August, Ibn Saud already has 250,000 in hand. Ibn Saud will be disgusted by refusal, and this also will alienate the sympathies of his adherents from him. They, as already reported, are by no means content at the results \yhich have accrued from his espousal of British cause. Ibn Saud is not so strong as might be imagined from a perusal of current official literature. - i - - ' * i His Majesty’s Government must finally be prepared to hear that Mr# Piiilby, on receipt of.final intimation of the refusal has found it necessary to leave for coast and to terminate his Mission. tt Serial No. 56.Telegram P., No. 77Jl, dated the 15th (received 16th) September 1918.

Cox’s telegram,* . March 20th (9th ?) whatever mav be the final decision with regard to the 1,000 rifles. This policy has been somewhat modified in execution on the spot under pressure of circumstances, and Philby’s views and sympathy have a contrary trend as indicated in his very full telegrams.^ Philby, who has been absent for about a year, has spent more than half oi this period under conditions of some discomfort and complete isolation in Central Arabia. He has travelled widely and for students and travellers his experiences will be most valuable material, hut he has reached the end of his tether so far as his Mission to Ibn Sand is concerned. I accordingly recommend that he be permitted to proceed on leave which is long overdue to him. That he should be replaced is, however, essential, and his successor should he an officer of no less and if possible higher standing. Hostilities between Ibn Sand and Sheriff are otherwise likely to ensue at once. It is preferable from many points of view that he should be succeeded by a nominee of the High Commissioner of equivalent status, in the Sheriff’s confidence, and with a first-hand knowledge of conditions in the Hedjaz. I would, therefore, suggest that the British High Commissioner, Egypt, be asked to depute an officer, if available, for the appointment. The deputation of such aa officer would put an end to the belief that our Arabian politics are not co-ordinated and allay King Hussain’s suspicions. I am prepared if he is unable to do so, to send Brevet-Lieutenant-Colonel Leachman for the purpose. He should be accompanied by a second Political Officer of his own selection from this force and be given temporary rank of Brigadier-General while so employed. Leachman is well posted with current developments in Arabia and has visited the Hedjaz. So far as he is able he is prepared to give effect to the present orders and wishes of His Majesty’s Government. His reputation and experience and his knowledge of Arab tribes (even on Anah) to Riyadh will ensure him a respectful hearing. I am authorised by the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief to say that he concurs with the foregoing. 95 Telegram R., No. 7736, dated the 16th (received Nth) September 1918.

On this front view of Political Officers is that by means of a military post at Safwan Ajman cannot be controlled by taking hostages or by threat of refusing supplies on our part. General Headquarters are averse to first proposal in any case. It is declared by all leading Shaikhs who have been interviewed that they cannot restrain their companions and followers from this ancient pastime. Warning has been given to them that their small subsidies will be finally discontinued if raids continue. No other action is at present contemplated beyond this. So far as we are concerned Ibn Saud is, therefore, provided safety of the Basrah-Nasiriyah Railway is not endangered and hostilities with Koweit principality are not involved, at liberty to take action against the Ajman. This should prove a convenient objective for his energies in place of Ibn Rashid. Ends, 102 (Jfr.

From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Baghdad, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart^ ment, Simla. (Addressed to Secretary of State; repeated to Cairo.) Despatch to Koweit of detachment of troops to be stationed near residence of Political Agent at Bandar Shuweikh some three miles west of Koweit is recommended by me. At Koweit the presence of a strong detachment of troops is calculated-— (1) To assist Political Agent in his effort in direction of the blockade and to stimulate Salim to maintain it effectively. (2) To encourage Ibn Saud to leave to us to settle his differences with Koweit which are becoming increasingly acute and to show him that we are doing our best on the above lines. There are valid practical objections to stationing detachment at Jaharah and all our experience up here shows that troops cannot effectively deal with isolated Bedouin raiding parties whose objectives are not troops but unknown third parties. I am, therefore, not in favour of occupation of Jaharah nor of any attempt to check raids by the use of troops. Ibn Saud’s complaints about Ajman raids have, in my opinion, been greatly magnified by him for his own ends and there is no reason why we should actively intervene in the matter now that His Majesty’s Government have decided that Ibn Saud is not to attack Ibn Rashid. • serial No 98 re ^ ers J 0UT telegram* of the 19th September.103 No. 18643 7-10, dated Baghdad, the 6th (received 24th) September 1918 F '° m ~ L C~^ro^B%Id a I IL80H ’ C - M - G ’ e i E - D S a &gt; T0_Th6 menf sfmU 4116 Qovernment of India in the Foreign and Political Depart- In continuation of my letter,* 14731, dated July 23rd, I have the honour to • Serial No. 40 . enclose, for the information of the Govern- a u j i * * v ^f 11 * of India ’ C0 Pi« 8 as per attached Schedule of further correspondence which has passed regarding the Koweit SCHEDULE. 1.

From—Political, Koweit, To—Political, Baghdad (repeated Basrah). Eollowing from Philby, Riyadh, M.-109, July 18th -.—Begins. News arrived here 16th that mixed gang of about 100 Ajman and Aslam Shammar worked down coast under protection and cognizance of Awazim and after drawing blank in raid on Zaab sub-section of A1 Murra fell upon Subai encamped between Qatif and Hasa and captured three herds of camel. Subai securing assistance of Zaab followed up and counterattacked retiring enemy and routed them killing five men including I bn Kumaisa of Sulaiman section123 W .. |# Aiman and 11 camels besides capturing three men .and 20 camels and recovering their own herds. Enemy was pursued but took refuge with Awazim whose numbers compelled pursuers to withdraw. Leader s of Ajman were, (1) Khumais ibn Munaikhir; (2) Id ibn Mutalaqqam; (3) Daman ^ ibn Musaiyid and leader of Aslam was Satam, brother ot Dhin ibn larla. Chief of Awazim implicated is Ra ul Palma. Captives reported that earlier in proceedings they had raided Najd cara van proceeding from Koweit under Ibn Sand’s agent, Abn Rubai, and captured 50 camels, and this is corroborated by other information and means oO camel loads of goods for enemy. Ibn Saud had during past months warned Shaikh Koweit, that Ajman elements were scheming with Ra al Fahama and^ Salim replied pleading ignorance but undertaking to enquire and stop business. 1 have both his letters dated Rajab 6th and Shaban 2 Ah, respectively. Subai ask Ibn Saud what he proposes do about it and Ibn Saud asks me what we propose to do about it. That Salim was fully cognisant of movements of gang and omitted taking steps to prevent it admits of little doubt. That he was privy to their plans not improbable. That he is responsible for the occurrence is indisputable. Moreover circumstances of raid constitute break of agreements by Ajman and Salim. This and other recent events are causing widespread resentment in Najd and making things extremely difficult for Ibn Saud and myself. Serious consequences will ensue if this sort of thing allowed continue indefinitely and Ibn Saud complains we are not giving him our support. Reg that matter may receive serious attention without delay. In this case would propose for consideration— (1) That Ajman and Aslam including Dhari be refused all Musabilla until ringleaders and stolen camels be handed over in which case former should be detained in Jail. And (2) That Salim be warned that next ^ occurrence of raid by Ajman or Shammar via Koweit territory or tribes will result in his deposition or other serious action. Salim should also be called upon to punish Ra al Fahama to British satisfaction. Salim has had a lot of rope and cannot expect us to ^ dally with him indefinitely while we are fast losing confidence of Ibn Saud in our bona Jides. Ends. Telegram, No. 1152, dated the 2nd (received 3rd) August 1918 (Confidential). From—Political, Koweit, To—Political, Baghdad. Following from Philby, Riyadh, M.-110, July 18th:— Begins. Reference correspondence ending with Koweit telegram, 9&lt;-C. of July 7th. Firstlg, understand— (1) That all blockade arrangements including issue of passes are can celled. (2) That Najd caravans can buy what they like and take it away without let or hinderance. (3) That Salim is to be given another run and be trusted to see that goods do not get into wrong hands. And (4) That imports are to be regulated on basis of reasonable requirements of Koweit town and tribes plus actual export to Najd as reported from time to time by Abdullah Nafisi.124 Secondly, certain obvious criticisms of new scheme hare doubtless been considered but remedy not stated, namely: (1) If Najdis may purchase without pass, permission or question how is Abdulla Nafisi to ascertain what they purchase for exporter how prevent undesirable Najdi individuals purchasing to smuggle to enemy. Without blockade staff he cannot be expected to do either. (2) If passes abolished how can Ibn Saud check arrivals this end. Personally can see no remedy short of entertainment of private blockade staff by Abdulla Nafisi or subjection of Najd exporters to inquisition by Shaikh’s blockade officials. Pormer alternative obviously impracticable and would be more offensive to Shaikh than British blockade. Latter would produce endless friction between Shaikh and Ibn Saud in view of present strained relations due to breakdown of Ajman arrangements. Thirdly, absolutely no guarantee of Shaikh’s good faith and no means of satisfying ourselves bow he acquits himself of his duties. Previous record makes it extremely unlikely he will keep out Shammar and Ajman smugglers. Indeed when last post left Koweit, following caravans from Hail were actually in Koweit, namely, (1) Saad A1 Hizzani and Azaima with 70 camels and (2) Abdul Aziz Ibn Humaiyim and Abu Adal with unknown number. We thus revert to original unsatisfactory situation of two years back which gave rise to all this trouble. Fourthly, deplore invidious task criticising accomplished fact but Ibn Saud extremely sore about new development. Prom the beginning he has always taken line that he cannot blockade his territory without losing hold over Qasim elements unless serious effort made to blockade Koweit itself. After much discussion and the fiasco of last April, scheme of blockade was evolved which was not only effective as evidenced by large crop of Shainmar advances but gave universal satisfaction in Najd. Ibn Saud threw himself with zest into task of ensuring effective measures here and had evolved simple and stringent scheme which promised complete success when suddenly without consultation all arrangements cancelled. In circumstances Ibn Saud asks me inform Government that he cannot accept any resposibility for leakage of goods to enemy so long as Koweit remains open to all comers. He also points out that such leakage will prejudice his plans for action against Shammar and Ibn Bashid. Fifthly, am not in position appreciate relative merits efficient blockade and maintenance friendly relations with Shaikh at expense thereof but possible effect of new measures on Najd blockade has not been considered. On tljis point I have no illusions. Undesirable Najdis will be the first to reopen trade with enemy. Difficult suggest remedy but offer following suggestion for consideration, namely;— (1) Leave Koweit arrangement unaltered so far as concerns reasonable requirements of town and tribes. (2) Forbid access to Koweit markets by all Najdis traders or Badawin. (3) Notify India that in future Bahrain, Qatif or Uqair will be Najd trade inlets and request them to notify public accordingly and allow ships to discharge Najd cargoes there either on outward or return journey without limit of quantities. (4) Ibn Saud will see that cargoes are not re-exported by dhow from Qatif and Uqair while at Bahrain. Dhows should obtain clearance certificate showing destination and cargo. Those coming to Hasa ports will be examined by Ibn Saud’s Collector of Customs. Have discussed possible solution on these lines with Ibn Saud who approves proposa] and is ready to notify Najdis and Abdulla Nafisi that no Najdi is to go to Koweit for any purpose without his permission and to accept full responsibility as before for effective blockade of all stuff landed at ports mentioned. Bahrain merchants if notified would soon indicate their requirements to Indian agents and it would be essential to ensure sailing of reasonable number of ships say on basis of previous sailings to Koweit.125 Result would be automatically. Stop inland export trade from Koweit as all buyers would be clearly buying for enemy. As only alternative is acquiescence in all round breakdown of blockade and leakage to enemy, trust proposals will receive urgent favourable considera tion to relieve tension here. Finally, Koweit advices to Ibn Saud indicate heavy bear sales of British futures owing to our climbdown which is attributed to serious war situation evidenced by defeat in France and cessation of ^ news from Palestine. Please keep me informed of all Arab and Palestine activities. Ends. Telegram R., No. 110-C., dated (and received) the 4th August 1918. From—Political, Koweit, To—Political, Baghdad (repeated Basrah). P. S. M.-109 and other Najd correspondence. I venture to assure you that strong action of some kind by ourselves is only satisfactory means of stopping raiders and restoring our name.

Shaikh Salim recently proposed to build a wall around Koweit with only three or four exits to give visible proof of his intention really to control exports by land, particularly during the winter when the watchmen would not be very active in their patrol work. I had much difficulty in preventing him rushing into vast expense on a work of little or no practical value without unduly damping his new-born enthusiasm, but I suggested that the situation might have changed before winter and persuaded him to postpone the work for the present.

When Philby wrote his M.-110 he had not I think received copy of my memorandum 98-C. to you. Shaikh has taken over our system of checking land exports so that Bin Saud will still receive passes. Najd cara vans if stated by Nafisi to be genuine may buy what they like and copy of export permit countersigned by Nafisi is to be given to us. 1 do not think friction should be caused for Nafisi can at any time tell us if any sort of obstruction takes place. Present trade arrangements are as follows :— Nothing is to be exported from India to Koweit without pass signed by McCallum or myself. Political Officers at Gulf Ports are taking such execu tive action as possible to prevent unduly large exports to Koweit. Our permits are issued. (1) Monthly* up to requirements of Koweit and its tribes. (2) On production of receipt from Basrah or other customs showing that goods manifested by sea from Koweit have actually arrived. (3) On vouchers from Nafisi that caravan of Bin Saud has taken such and such quantities. (4) To merchants desiring to import new stocks on their giving accept able guarantee to produce evidence of arrival at unobjectionable destina tion. ' ^ No exports are allowed by land except by Shaikh for Koweit tribes, by Najd caravans vouched for by Nafisi and by caravans if any bearing pass signed by Iraq Political Officers which has to be presented to us. Arrangement is based on trust of Shaikh and, in view of fright and Koweit public have received our turning away of caravans and Zayani, is likely to work satisfactorily for the present. If arrangement fails diversion of Najd traffic to Bahrain might be carried oat in addition to any other puni tive action Government might decide to take but I would deprecate doing so till then. I understand Bin Sand’s suspicions both of Shaikh and of ns, but it must be remembered that had he exercised effective control over his eastern territory from the beginning, our task here would have been a comparatively light one. At the same time it seems essential to take some action ourselves to show Bin Saud that we intend to support him, to restore our name in the eyes of the Arabs who undoubtedly look on our withdrawal of blockade as due to weakness and to keep alive present spirit of co-operation shown by Shaikh. To this end suggest that we should forthwith establish post at Safwan to guard water-supply filling up all wells not covered by post. Authorise Bin Saud to occupy Hafar. Arrange with Shaikh to occupy Safah : be has already 300 men at Jahara. I should be authorised to inform Shaikh that if any further raiding party passed through Koweit territory we shall be forced to take part ourselves to prevent recurrence. You are best in position to judge what action should be taken regarding Ajman and Dbari hut they are a constant source of trouble and have proved themselves unworthy of any regard ; would it not be preferable to have them open enemies and harry them as sucla as soon as above action has been taken which enable us to meet raids.130 Saad at Hizani passed through Koweit, see my 806, June 19th. Other names not known. Translation of letter from Political Agent, Koweit, to His Excellency Shaikh Salim al Mubarak es Sabah, No. 220, dated the 31st July 1018 = 22nd Shawwal 1336. With reference to my letter of July 5th 19l8 = Hamadhan 24tli 1336, 1 write to inform Your Excellency of the plan which I propose for the issue of permits for the export of goods from India to Koweit so that trade may be carried on without hindrance. Firstly, as regards the supplies for Koweit and its tribes. The Assistant Political Agent has discussed this matter in full with your son Abdulla and the Mudir of Customs and they have agreed that the following quantities of goods are required for the needs of Koweit and its tribes in every month:— Rice • •• ... 10,000 bags Hour • • • ... 100 „ Sugar • • • 1,000 „ Coffee ••• 700 „ Tea • • • ... 250 cases Pepper • •• ... 40 bags and that the Assistant Political Agent will issue passes up to this amount every month on receiving a letter from Your Excellency informing him how you wish the amount to be distributed. Secondly, as regards the goods required for other legitimates t/rade, such as for supplying the caravans of the friend of all His Excellency Shaikh Abdul Aziz bin Abdur Rahman bin Eaisal as Saud or of other friends of the High Government and for shipment to Basrah and elsewhere. In the case of caravans from the people of Najd Abdulla al Nafisi will be surety for the amount taken by the caravans and on receiving his bond the Assistant Political Agent will issue passes up to that amount. Similarly tribes from the territory under the High Government must produce passes from the Political Officers in whose charge tl ey are before they are allowed to take supplies and when such a pass is received the Assistant Political Agent will issue passes up to the amount of goods taken away. When goods are taken away by sea the Mudir of Customs will receive a recei pt from the Customs at Basrah or the Customs officials or the British representative at the port to which the goods are taken and when he gives the receipt to the Assistant Political Agent the latter will issue passes up to that amount. When a merchant has exported goods in the above manner and the Assist ant Political Agent wishes to issue passes for the export of more goods from India he will first ask the merchant if he wishes to replace his stock and if not will write and ask Your Excellency to what merchant or merchants the passes should be given. If a merchant who has not exported any goods wishes to bring goods from India for sale to caravans or for export to Basrah or elsewhere he should make a request to the Assistant Political Agent through Your Excellency and must give a bond to the value of the goods that he will produce the receipt from Abdulla al Nafisi or the officials at the port to which he sends the goods otherwise his bond will be executed upon him. In this way there will be no hardship for legitimate trade and the control of all the trade wdll be in the hands of Your Excellency as Ruler of the country. Until the goods which were bought by the High Government are exhausted, as far as possible, merchants will be given passes to take the amounts they require from those goods. -MMirarNo. 1174—7-C., dated Koweit, the 3rd Augufc 1918.

From—His Majesty's High Commissoner, Egjpt, Cairo, q 0 —The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla. (Addressed to Foreign Office ; sent to Baghdad.) King Hussain’s reply to Colonel Basset’s letter about proposed meeting between brother of Bin Sand and Sheriff Abdulla is not very satisfactory. Sheriff of Mecca is in a very difficult and suspicious frame of mind as already reported. He expresses his willingness to receive at any time brother of Bin Sand and to do him honour but he makes no reference to presence of British representatives. He also frankly expresses his dislike to Ikhwan sect which he stigmatizes by calling them a political society working to detriment of Arab interests under guise of religion. I fear that no good will come of meeting immediately and until matter has been previously discussed fully between Abdulla and Political Officer. The fall of Medina which is probable owing to victories in Palestine will render it impossible to withdraw Abdulla to coast for this purpose. In circumstances I must recommend all arrangements for meeting be deferred for present. 105 Telegram P., No, 8060, dated the 26th (received 27th) September 1918.

(In the name of the Compassionate and Merciful God.) Praise be to the Lord, the Creator of the Universe; and may God pray for and have mercy on our Prophet Muhammad (the most honoured Prophet) and his family and Companions 1 Dated 25th July 1918. Our dear loving friend Mr. Philby, Your are well aware of the discussions which were held among us on all points generally, and particularly on our internal and external affairs. In stating to you our needs and what circumstances demand our object in explaining them to you was that you should inform Sir Percy Z. Cox, the Civil Commissioner, that we depended on him after God and consequently, would accept his views. Realising your wide knowledge of the affairs of the Arabs and your kindness in regard to the interests of your Government, con fident as we were of your bond fide, and depending on you after God, we have duly informed you verbally of what was necessary. But having now observed certain differences on some of the points and problems, we are prompted to write this representation, so that you may under stand my point of you and I yours. I. First problem .—You had proposed that we .should decide upon and push operations against Ihn Rashid, in order that, should God help us in cap turing him and Hayel also, both we and the British liovernment would enjoy rest and we Arabs need have no further relations with the Turks. We tofd you that this was our view, and the best course and, before your departure to Hedjaz, we had settled between us certain questions and points without which the situation could not improve, and you concurred subject to the approval of His Britannic Majesty’s Government. When you met us at Shanqi you rejected those views and explained to us how it was impossible to act in accordance with them. . We then resolved to take up the fight with Ibn Rashid, and you expressed the view that the Gov ernment would provide us with the necessary supplies and materials for the war if we fought with him and prosecuted the war to the utmost of our power. Out of our sincere friendship with His Britannic Majesty’s Government and in consideration of the fact that our interests in regard to the enemy are identi cal, we accepted your proposals (although we realised that they involved some trouble and loss to ourselves) and we informed you that, at the beginning of Ramadhan, our son Turki would make a move in order to initiate the fight, and that, after Ramadhan, w* would proceed towards Qasim. To that end I set myself to work with all energy. * When the messengers of Snammar came in to us for peace (on conditions that Ibn Ajil and others should be under our control as their tribes werebefore), we referred the matter to you and you expressed the opinion that we should not be friend tribes of Ibn Rashid on account of his enmity to His Britannic Majesty’s Government and the help he renders to the Turks unil we could guarantee that they would not return to him or afford him assistance. We explained to you that we could not do that as Shammar and Ibn Rashid were all the same for good and evil. Our object in bringing in the Shammar was based upon political expediency, both internal and foreign, that is to say, it seemed that our doing favours to them and supplying them with their needs would, after all, run result in friendship between them and us and enmity between them and Ibn Rashid; and we should be able to have access to their Councils and prompt them neither to help Ibn Rashid against us nor to further his pro-Turk policy or interests; a course which would result in reducing Ibn Rashid to the same weak state in which he was at Hajar and other places. We also pointed out that if we displayed ^n aggressive attijpde to the Shammar or banish them from our territories we should harm ourself, as, in the first place, we were afraid they would seek shelter with you (as has already happened) and get their needs (supplies, &amp;c.) from you, and then in the spring would turn round and ally themselves with Bin Rashid in revenge for our having banished them from our country, and in furtherence of Ibn Rashid’s cause. In the second place, Ibn Rashid would have strong reasons vis-a-vis the Turkish Government for declining siding with the Shammar in his weakness, on the excuse that we (Ibn Saud) have fought his tribe and helped the British against the Turks. In these circumstances the Turks would be obliged to help Ibn Rashid with arms, supplies, money and &amp;c. (as they have already done and are still doing). We told you then that this would be the inevitable result. Ibn Rashid has now achieved his objects. The Shammar have sought shelter with you in order to derive from you their needs, and will thus have no grievance against Ibn Rashid regarding their starvation and so forth. Conse quently enmity has ensued between us and the Shammar, who, bearing grudges against us for having banished them from our territories, are now obliged to help Ibn Rashid and seek shelter with him, though some of them have no liking for him. Ibn Rashid has, likewise, gained another object from the Turks : While claiming (locally) that he has won the Shammar over to his side after dispersion by Ibn Saud and at a time when he (Ibn Rashid) had already got sufficient forces of his own ; he tells the Turks that he is unable to help them because his tribes and country are being threatened. He has thus, as you will see, obtained his needs from the Turks, who as you must have beared did not fail to meet his wants. We are now, therefore, at a loss what to do. We are no more as we were before, at a time when we used to deal ourselves with our affairs and seek for our interests whenever they were, and ar, a time when we were not bound, with your Government settling our affairs in a manner advantageous both to us and to them. We no longer deal with our affairs in accordance with our own knowledge of the Arabs and the policy that would best suit them. On the contrary the British Government has now become as it were two Govern ments—that of Egypt (which goes by the words of the Sheriff, believes him, ahff executes bis ambitions, whether right or wrong), and that of Iraq, which receives our enemies with open hands and prevent us from punishing them. Take for instance the Ajman and tho Shammar, although they go against us and against the Government, to the advantage of Ibn Rashid and tbe Turks, yet they are offered facilities for coming in to you in order to take away their supplies, &amp;c., whenever necessary. % These have demonstrated their enmity to us by raiding our adherents and plundering their properties. Our subjects, who are under us, consist of the following:—Those who are friendly with us and give advice to us and who shut their eyes in disgust at these deeds and feel disappointed and sorry for their occurrence—and those who are ignorant, and contemplate reverting towards the said hostile tribes due (and thanks to God for it) to our pressure on them, in that we, for the sake of keeping the subjects in perfect orde’* irnd rest, do not allow anyone to trespass on the other.134 You are aware that the Ajman and the Shammar are numerous, and that all Arabs consider us as being prohibited from doing anything against them, and that the latter are now free and do what they like, just as the other sections of the Ajman and Shammar (who are now with you) have done. ^ f? As you are with us, you prompt us to fight Ibn Rashid and carry out orders of your Government, and this we consider an incumbent duty and of the greatest utility to us. Therefore, if you have a final decision from your Government, we request you that you may sanction what I cannot do without and I will be bound by your orders; or, if you have no final instructions that you may refer our said proposals for approval, failing which we might be treated as a friend (free tf obligations), that we might settle our affairs with the Arabs themselves. The proposals raised by us and which we demand are :— (1) Question of the Sheriff .—The Egyptian Government should admit that the Sheriff has nothing to do with all our territories, both the townsmen and the nomads. Both our boundaries and his should be defined, that no one of us should encroach on the boundaries of the others. This His Britannic Majesty’s Government should guarantee by a very firm recognition, so that no f one of us should have an excuse on the other, and that both peace and rest on which our mutual interests depend might be established among ourselves. (2) Question of the Jjnian and the Shammar. —These sections of the Ajman and Shammar, which are within the territories of Government and are guaranteed by her, and which he does not want to be encroached upon, should be absolutely prohibited from wandering inside our territories either with their families or with their raiding parties, and should not be supplied with such large amounts of food-stuffs as will enable them to help Ibn Rashid and others, but should rather be given their monthly consumption only, month by month. As a precautionary measure against abuse, the distribution of the supplies among them should be made with our co-operation and that of the Government. But the other sections of the Ajman and the Shammar, which do not enjoy the trust and the confidence both of us and of Government should be expelled from all territory occupied by the Government, and should not be given sufficient supplies to strengthen them and give encourage ment to pursue their aims. This also should be carried out in consultation between you and with us, in such a manner as will secure and protect the interests of both of us. (3) Question of Koweit and the Access of inhabitants of Najd thereto .— We are positively sure that Bin Sabah and Bin Rashid have a complete under standing with each other; and, according to our belief, they are supporting one another in this affair. This concord on part of Bin Sabah accounts for the fact that whereas he had asked us to violate the Blockade Regulations as laid down by His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and we had refused, in further ance of our internal interests, to comply with them—therefore his enmity was aroused against us and hence the friction which has prompted him to go against us and help our enemies. If the control of blockade remains in the hands of Bin Sabah and the inhabitants of Koweit, then we must not be held responsible for the leakage of the supplies to Syria and El-Jabal, and &amp;c. Any how, this question could he disposed of in two ways:—(1) either that the goods imported to Koweit should be controlled by the Government in such a way as to ensure their non-exportation to Najd or to the Desert unless authorized by our agent, acting under the supervision of the Government, or (2) that the trade goods of our subjects should be unloaded in our own sea-ports under our guarantee. We mention this proposal for the advantages involving us and the Govern ment. In this way we will firstly prevent trade goods being smuggled to the enemy and will secondly remain under no doubt as to the false reports of our enemies made against us and against our subjects to the Government. (4) Funds for the war, —If these questions are favourably settled and war is waged by us against Bin Rashid, the Government should give anundertaking to provide us with the necessary funds and to supply us with all She arms and ammunitions as may be necessary for us and which we cannot get but from Government sources. As soon as these demands are accepted, we will undertake, by the Grace of Gcd, to do more even than what the Government expects from us. But if these demands are not entertained, then we will be unable to meet their wishes. We hope that you will consider those portions of this our letter which you understand and ask us for explanations, on any parts which you. do not understand, and we will then give the necessary explanations. ~ This is what was necessary to trouble you with. .We pray God to lead ^is to a favourable end. May you be .preserved. [Seal.] Abdul Aziz al Saud, Ruler of Najd, Hassa, Qatif % Jubail i and Dependencies and Chief of their tribes. Dated 16th Skaiowal 1336^=25th July 1918, , Enclosure No. 2. ; (Letter from Ibn Saud to Mr. Philby, dated th§ 10th August 1918.) L (In the name of the Compassionate and Merciful God.) ! Dated the 10th August 1918. Prom —Abdul Aziz ibn Abd-in Rahman al Faisal al Saud, To— H. St. J. Philby, Eqs., C.I.E. We have'read your memorandum, and what you have explained has been ^understood by us, particularly the communication of the Ministers of His Britannic Majesty’s Government^ addressed to us and to the Sheriff, which representation is to the effect that they desired that we should have concord among ourselves and drop our present differences, owing to the present circumstances of this war, and in consideration of the rights of the Allies and those of our subjects as well,, lest we should all suffer (on account of our differences). tVe, your friends, were pleased and thankful (to their representation), for their desire was what we were aiming at. We have already not failed to do our duty towards him (the Sheriff), nor will we fail in the future; and we thank God that, from the enquiries* you have made from others, you must have realised our good-will, and the extent to which we have worked hard to improve our past and present relations with him. We swear in the name of God that we «are unwilling (although it might be to our own interests) that there should exist the least difference between us and any other persons, whose interests it may be of advantage to His Majesty’s Government to push, and to the disadvantage of the Turks and their Allies. We recognise that we should not spare our lives or the lives of those subject to us, should such sacrifice cause harm to the Turks and their Allies and be advantageous to our Friend, His Britannic Majesty’s Government. We are, by the help of God, doing all what we can to avoid all acts that might prejudice the cause, although we have suffered considerable disadvantage by reason of the Sheriff’s long-standing endeavours to meddle within our limits and with our subjects whom l e has for a long time tried to detach from us and gain over to ids side, although we are confident that all our subjects, who have sense and remain with us, will never side with him, nor with any one else, yet you will agree that one cannot tolerate interference. Nevertheless^ru trt- irhnr sake sunk our own interests, and have worked for the rneral beoeht of .U of’ T in proof thereof, the Chief Political Officer i* aware of some facts (of which you are also aware) namely . m That when vou occupied Basrah we had sent messengers to the Sheriff and invited him to ally himself with us, and you, and join hands in opposing the Turks; and we received a reply from him, which we do not remember, for the late Captain Shakespear had taken it for the information ot the Chief Political Officer. That when we met with the Chief Political Officer at Qatit, he had ', nl tn corresnond with the Sheriff and invite him to renew the treaty between himself and us and combine in warring against the Turks, but the replv^handed to the Chief Political Officer) received from him had such a ffieUv objectionable tone that we felt excited m defence of our se f and honour and we wanted to retaliate; hut we did not do it; and when we reCed the matter to the Chief Political Officer he had requested and urged „ ,L tn fnraive the happenings of the past for the general benefit. We accordingly Responded tohis wishes and treated him (the Sheriff) in an extra- ordinary good manner. » , A Jain before you arrived for the first time, the state of affairs had once more changed, and troubles had risen among our subjects, resulting m some casualties. When you met us, we informed you of what was going on, and you had requested us to drop all sources of quarrel, and entrust you with the career of settling them amicably. When we left the matter in your hands, you had then g&lt;»ne to him at Jeddah. You know better what happened between yourself and him and you must have known his news and views. When von went to Egypt, more encroachment was committed by him on our subjects in the Hedjaz, and he started his intrigues in our territory, in the villages of Najd and among the nomads. We them wrote to him a letter of warnings (copy of which you keep). On receiving it he gave us a truculent answer (which was banded to you when you returned from El-Wadi) and we wanted to take him at his word and trust him, but again you asked us to drop it for the sake of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and we did so for vour own sake. Later on, he encroached on the inhabitants of Hazmah for the first time, and you urged us to have patience and keep quiet until you could refer the matter to His Majesty’s Government, and we did so. Again, for the second time, he encroached on us, and we were consequently very much excited and moved by our religious and patriotic feelings, but you requested us to keep quiet until the reply of the representation made by you to His Majesty's Government had reached you. Out of consideration lor t interests of His Majesty’s Government, and in fulfilment of our promises we again dropped the matter, although it affected our religion and honour. Such is the state of affairs between us and him as you know quite well. Please look at our letters to you and to him and compare them with his answers to us or his letters to you regarding us, and if you find that we have committed a mistake, either by action or by writing, please tell it to us ana take us to account for it, and if you find out that he has been m fault m regard to us, either in his sayings, actions, or writings, then we should be blamed and the fault should fall upon him. You have just seen the letters from his son Abdullah, addressed to some of our prominent tribes, which letters we have handed to you, and from which vou can realise to what lengths he has gone in his cruelty. This was the juncture at which we received your above mentioned letter. We are now ready to accept your orders. Either that we should both leave aside our differences till the end of war, pending your decision as to who is to blame, or that you should now investigate our differences. H he. is proved to have the least right over us or over our subjects, or over the people of Khurma (whether this right be legal by law or custom or by the choice ol the subjects) we are prepared to recognise it and adhere to orders, but tfBMtfrt 11- — 1C 137 shown to have no right over us, nor right of protection over them—either in the past nor in the future or hy law nor by custom—or, if you see that they do not recognise him (as a 'Chief) but rather reject him, then we leave the order to God^and to you. You should then either prevent him completely from encroaching on our territories and we wall not encroach on his, or you should leave us to settle our own affairs. It would then be in the hand of God to support or reduce one of us as He may be pleased to do. But at present we listen to your orders, and shall not make any move, neither on the part of us nor on ‘the part of our subjects. If he adheres to \our orders it will be much the better, but if be disobeys them and encroaches upon us, we will be obliged to punish him in return. You made enquiries from us as to Avhat w T as the original cause for our enmity to the Sheriff. In reply we know of no original reasons beyond what we are mentioning hereafter : — (1) In the beginning, our ancestors were very friendly with his Moham mad ibn ’On, ’Abdullah ibn ’On, ’On-er-Bafi’, and ’Ali Pasha were allied with us and w r e were each supporting the other. But the 1 urks made an attempt to separate us from one another, and we Sheriffs adhered to the lurks by force, by their tongues and by their actions, although we were each confident of one another. ' One the outbreak of trouble between Abdul Hamid and^ the Committee of Union and Progress, the latter made an attempt to induce Sheriff Abdullah (who died at Constantinople) to go out and make an agreement with Ibn liashid against us. ^ Sheriff Abdullah having refused to execute their washes, they tried Sheriff: Hossain, who after giving them an undertaking to combine with Ibn Baslnd against us, made the trouble which is not hidden from your knowledge. He firstlv went out towards Najd. Being at that time in friendly relations witk‘him, we deputed Sad ibn Abdur Bab man to go to him for an ' explanation, when the Sheriff seized and imprisoned him and made some demands from us. Being at that time forced to keep ^ him away from us, owing to his active movements, we took some precautionary measures and. settled our political matters amicably. Wh^n matters were settled we made him understand that we could not tolerate his unjustifiable intrigues. It was then that enmity between him and us arose. . ^ ‘ . c When God caused him to fall in troubles with the Turks—in the time ot the Turkish Vali of Hedjaz, Wabib Beg—he was obliged to come to an under standing with us in order to preserve his own interests. We then as a result agreed with each other. But when the Ajman • trouble arose and inuidents took place at A1 Bassa and when Ibn Rashid betrayed the inhabitants of Al-Qasim notwithstanding the treaty he made with us, the Sheriff, acting in accordance with a compact between them, • deputed his son Abdullah with a view to occupy Ivajd. At that time he demonstrated his enmity to our religion and to our worldly ambdions and .wrote many provocative letters to the natives of Najd, one of them bei o letter to‘ibn Darwish. The latter letter we have handed to you, the remainder will, God wills, he handed to you as soon as we have found them. This is the history of our relations with him, from the beginning up to the end. As a matter of fact, he is a man fond of intrigues. He loves to mix him- self up with the affairs of Arabs. . This may be accounted lor by the laet that the British have supported his paramount sovereignty over the Arabs, beeing that the Arabs have paid no heed to his claim to sovereignty over them and seeing that we and the other Arab Chieftains refuse to reoogmsd him as a piramount sovereign oviing to his opposition to our religion and 'OrWlyattas, he is now making the desparate efforts that we see. But as you know the Arabs still follow the example of their forbears. •138 Having realised that you have sympathy for the Arabs and are trying to unite them^and leave the rulers to enjoy their Chieftainships, just as you have done with the Rajas of India, and &amp;c., we were confident that you would not force us, or force others, to undergo new changes contrary to the customs to which the Arabs have been subjected. The Sheriff by his intrigues, hopes to make mischief between us so that he may achieve his ambitions, in your name. But we thank God for the confidence we have that you will not allow us to suffer any prejudice through yourselves, while on the other hand you know, and every wise man knows, that it is our duty to uphold and preserve our honour (which, bv the support of God, is the source of our maintenance) and to refuse to subjects ourselves to what our forefathers have never been subjected. We, your friend, have rather answered at length, hut it was necessary to do so in order to derive advantage and in order that you may know our stat* of affairs as it stands now r . This is what had to be explained. May you be preserved. [Seal], Dated 2nd Dhil-Qidah 1336 = 10th August 1918, 107 No. 18873—7-TO, dated Baghdad, the 10th (received 30th) September 1918.

Shaikh has taken over our system , ... . ot ‘ checking land exports so that Bin Sand will still receive passes. Najd caravans, if stated by Nafisi to be genuine, may buy what they like and copy of export permit countersigned by Nafisi is to be given to us. I do not think friction should be caused for Nafisi can at any time tell us if any sort of obstruction takes place. Present trade arrangements are as follows :— Nothing is to be exported from India to Koweit without pass signed by McCallum or myself. Political Officers at Gulf ports are taking such° execu tive action as possible to prevent unduly large exports to Koweit. Our permits are issued. (1) Monthly up to requirements of Koweit and its tribes. (2) On production of receipt from Basrah or other customs showing that goods manifested by sea from Koweit have actually arrived. (3) On vouchers from Nafisi that caravan of Bin Saud has taken such and such quantities. (4) To merchants desiring to import new stocks on their giving acceptable guarantee to produce evidence of arrival at unobjectionable destination. No exports are allowed by land except by Shaikh for Koweit tribes, by Najd caravans vouched for by Nafisi and by caravans if any bearing pass signed by Iraq Political Officers which has to be presented to us. Arrangement is based on trust of Shaikh and, in view of fright and Koweit public have received our turning away of caravans and Zayani, is likely to work satisfactorily for the present. If arrangement fails diversion of Najd traffic to Bahrein might be carried out in addition to any other puni tive action Government might decide to take but I would deprecate doing so till then. I understand Bin Saud’s suspicions both of Shaikh and of us, but it must be remembered that had he exercised effetive control over his eastern territory from the beginning our task here would have been a comparatively light one. At the same time it seems essential to take some action ourselves to show Bin Saud that we intend to support him, to restore our name in the beyes of the Arabs who undoubtedly look on our withdrawal of blockade as due to weakness and to keep alive present spirit of co-operation shown by Shaikh. To this end suggest that we should forthwith establish post at Safwan to to guard water-supply, filling up all wells not covered by post. Authorise Bin Saud to occupy Hafar. Arrange with Shaikh to occupy Safah : he has already 300 men at Jaharah. I should be authorised to inform Shaikh that if any further raiding party passed through Koweit territory we shall be forced to take part ourselves to prevent recurrence. You are best in position to judge what action should be taken regarding Ajman and Dhari but they are a constant source of trouble and have proved themselves unworthy of any regard; would it not be preferable to have them open enemies and harry them as such as soon as above action has been taken which enable us to meet raids.

Reports received, firstly, that Ibn Jiflan and Ibn Sarhan of Salih and Sifrnn sections of Ajman recently raided Subai at Hafar al Ats and carried of six herds of camels, roughly BOO animals. This is boldest venture yet made as Hafar is across Dahana and only three days from Riyadh. Secondly, that Sultan ibn Hithlain and one of the Mutalaqqams have recently raided down to Jubai on Hasa border. This is not fully continued and details not to hand but seems no reason doubt accuracy of report. Mutair Chiefs including Al Duwish have been in recently to Ibn Saud to press for action against Ajman but on my assurance that Government is con sidering matter he is sending Abdul Rahman ibn Muhammad a trusted official, to tour districts involved and collect full details of recent raids. He will assure Mutair and Subai that Ibn Saud is taking up matter with British and will tiien visit Koweit and Basrah to present bill and endeavour effect settlement. Ife will have letters from me. This will prevent independent counter raids by tiibes concerned. This recrudescence of Ajman trouble simultaneously with Sheriffian pio- voeation is very unfortunate. Trust every effort will be made to put things right. Would suggest that at least all Musabilla and provisions be denied until satisfactorv settlement and that important hostages be taken for future behaviour. Ibn Saud still clings hopefully to prospect of British intervention all round in view His Majesty’s Government’s message and fully sees his best interests be in patience but temper of people very dilferent.

He had already heard of this proposal of Ibn Sand’s and had mentioned it to Lieutenant Roberts. I therefore had no scruple in discussing it with him without, however, disclosing Philby’s message. Ibrahim is strongly opposed to proposal. He says Ibn Saud’s sole object is to get a finger in Zubair tribal fire. Once he has done so, his agent will either have to be master in Zubair or if his advice be disregarded he will cause constant irritation by his complaints. Ibrahim ascribes whole move to an intrigue against himself on part of Bait Mandil. Abdul Wahab has been spending some time at his Zubair house recently. Suggests that we might reply to Philby’s proposal that not worth Ibn Saud’s while keep agent, Zubair, where important political questions are not decided that Ibn Saud already has agent, Basrah, whom if he choses to replace by another man we have no objection. Basrah and Zubair being now connect ed by rail are practically one place and Basrah in all respects more convenient. Ibn Saud might be left raise for himself question of appointing representative at Baghdad if he so desires. Ibrahim further discussed hostage question. According to him demand will never be accepted by Ajman or Shammar and was only put forward by ibn Saud to make us drive them into Ibn Rashid’s arms and so give him an excuse for not attacking latter. Ibrahim’s latest news from Hail is that supplies there are very short and there is a growing movement to urge Ibn Rashid to come to terms with us. Rashid Ibn Laila still in Damascus whence Turks will not let him start. Lively correspondence now going on between Ibn Rashid and Ibn Saud by hand of Ibn Rimal of Sinjara Shammar. Enclosure No. 5.

As regards the ground covered by the correspondence abovementioned I have so frequently and at such length communicated my views that it is un necessary for me on the present occasion to add to the work of the Telegraph Department. Nevertheless it will, perhaps, be as well not to maintain complete silence, particularly in view of the two telegrams from Cairo lest judgment be allowed to go by default and disaster ensue. I venture therefore once more to summarise the situation for your consideration. In the first place I would invite your attention to the telegram, despatch ed by me last January from Jeddah and Cairo, in which I repeatedly sought to warn Government that our failure to make full use of Ibn Saud’s proffered assistance and our refusal to supply him with the material equipment to make that assistance effective could not fail to embitter the already strained relation between the two Arabian rulers as Ibn Sand would certainly attribute our lukewarmness to Sheriffian intrigues and would consequently adopt a less compliant attitude towards Sheriffian provocation than he had hitherto done. Meanwhile the Sheriff had made matters worse by refusing to allow me to return to Riyadh overland and my irresponsible escort, with the Arab’s instinct for a good tale, returned to Ibn Saud with “lurid accounts ” of the Sheriff’s hostile reception {vide your telegram No. 1440 of 11th February 1918, to T ,. , , Arab Bureau, Cairo).

If one party excludes this item from the forbidden category the other would be within his rights in doing the same. I trust that I have already in previous telegrams made this point suffi ciently clear and that before you got this letter the danger will have been averted by the recall of the Sheriff’s troops from the neighbourhood of Khurma. I now turn to the detailed consideration of the High Commissioner’s telegrams which all appear unfortunately to have been despatched be t ore the High • Serial No. 24. f Serial No. 25. Copy attached. M.-147 of 8th August 1918. My 6863 to Cairo. Commissioner could have received a copy of my report* of June 25th which to a certain extent anticipates some of the points raised. Firstly, as regards High Commissioner’s first telegramf, 1128, dated 25th July 1918—please see the last sentence of my M.-115 of 6th August 1918, and the further reference to the matter at the beginning of my The whole crux of the situation is the Sheriff’s determination to re-occupy Khurma and I have said enough to shew what the inevitable result of another attempt on his part to do so will be. I repeat that I trust that Colonel Wilson did not commit himself or Government to an admission of the Sheriff’s claim to jurisdiction over Khurma or in any way express approval of the Sheriff’s declaration that his activities would be limited to recovering that locality. I repeat that the last sentence of the same telegram fills me with grave apprehension. With Ibn Sand I have steadily taken the line that, as both he and the Sheriff claim Khurma, the matter must be regarded as one of the points at issue between them in icspect o which the final decision must rest with His Majesty’s Government who, I have assured him, will consider and decide it in due course on its merits without fear or favour. On this explicit assurance Ibn Saud has not only refrained from all intervention in the affair but he has prevented the despatch of reinforcements to Khurma by its Akhwan sympathisers in Najd and moreover has expressly forbidden the Khurma people to carry the fight into the Sheriff s territory which they might well have done in pursuance of their two recent victories. I have already expressed my opinion that Ibn Saud’s conduct m the matter has throughout beeu exemplary and I trust that His Majesty s Government will accept your recommendation that an expressidn ot their approval should be conveyed to him. Secondly, as regards High Commissioner’s telegram of July 30th (Baghdad, No. 6262 of 31st July 1918) I would make the following comments: (1) In the first place I confess I cannot see any ground in the contents of J My 6113 , July 25th. my M.-98 (Koweit, 106-0.) for the High Commissioner’s that Ihn oauci s X Serial No. 26. v&gt;v....~^——— - - - -- attitude calls for correction. He had nothing, whatever, to do with the making or the defeat of the attack reported while to prevent matters going lurther he went so far as to warn the people of Khurma against anything in the nature of reprisals and to guarantee to me that no aggressive action would be under taken bv them. In this he appears to me to have done nothing but exercise his unquestionable influence over the Khurma people in the interests ot the preservation of peace. (2) Ibn Saud most undoubtedly claims Khurma as being within his jurisdiction—he does so not only on religious and territorial groun s u also on historical, administrative and tribal grounds. He therefore cousi era the Sheriff’s action as aggressive and hostile to himself. As I iave sai this is the chief disputed point between the two parties and Ibn au again and again asserted his willingness that the Brit.sh truvernment shcuid adjudicate on the dispute on its merits. It may be as well to precise regarding the grounds of Ibn Saud’s claim. _ (a) Religious .—The whole population of Khurma, Ashraf Subai, a a and Hadhr, are of the Wahhabi persuasion and moreover have joined .he mn r146 brotherhood of that sect* namely, the Akhwan. As s'hdh they regard all Wahhabis as Mushrikin (heretics) and Kaffav (infidels) and look iip to Ibn Saud as their Imam and temporal ruler. As far as 1 can ascertain they have been Wahhabis (or Haubalis) from all time—they bare become Akhtta.n largely in self defence against the Sheriff’s aggression dating from some years back and particularly since the Sheriff tried last year to impose a t^adhi on them with a view to breaking up their Wahhabi tendencies. As 'Vahhabis and Akhwan they have a religious claim on the protection of the people of Najd and Ibn Saud. (b) Territorial .—High Commissioner points out that Khurma is only SO miles in a direct line from Taif. That may be true hut. scarcely proves that Khurma is in the Bedjaz. I believe I am the only European who has ever seen Khurma and the country round it; I speak therefore with a full sense of my responsibility and my eonsidered view is that the boundary of the Hed jaz, in the widest sense in which that term is capable of being Used, runs (in the tract under consideration) along the eastern edge ol the Shaib Shaba south-westward to Turaba, This is undoubtedly the recognised boundary between the Ihiqum and Subai tribes and a reference to my route chart will shew^ that it comes up to within 10 miles of Khurma. This is my opinion while Ibn Saud and others with whom I have had opportunities of discussing the matter carry the boundary hack 50 miles westward to the Wadi AqiqL I believe this latter boundary can be established by Turkish documentary evidence as the line of the Aqiq was agreed upon in ‘the 70 S between the Turkish authorities and Ibn Rashid as being the natural boundary between the Hedjaz and Najd. However, I should feel inclined to disregard this evidence as the Buqum and Shalassa are to my view undoubtedly Hedjaz tribes. In my opinion therefore the Shaib Shaba is the only possible natural boundary and if this view is •accepted Khurma (though only 10 miles from the Hedjaz boundary) lies in Najd* (c) Tribal .—The Khurma tract is peopled wholly by the Sabai tribe, which is essentially a tribe of Najd and extends through its whole breadth from the Summan to Wadi Subai. In view of this Iba Saud claims jurisdic tion over the Subai of Khurma but is prepared to renounce his claim if the Subai themselves express a preference for Sberiffian rule; he is not. however, prepared to abandon them to the tender mercies of the Sheriff so long as they claim his protection and acknowledge his rule. (d) Historical and These grounds may be considered together. High Commissioner is informed that Khalid was nominated Amir oTKhurma four years ago by the Sheriff. This is improbable on the face of it as Khalid according to my information succeeded his cousin Ghalib on the •latter’s death in the ordinary course of inheritance and like other Amirs of INajd has regularly made his annual visit to Riyadh to receive his subsidy and presents ever since as his predecessor did before him. In any case if any formal appointment by the Sheriff took place and was acknowledged by Khalid , himself he ought to be in a position to produce documentary evidence. What ■ he in all probability means (turning the circumstance to suit his own present requirements) is that when Ghalib died his successor Khalid was formally recorded in the Turkish registers as the rightful recipient of the Haj Surra paid by the Turkish Government to all tribes in a position to annoy the annual pilgrim caravans. That is a very different matter and proves nothing as the pages of Doughty are sufficient to show that Surra was paid to tribes under Ibn Rashid’s admitted jurisdiction—in fact to all tribes likely to be troublesome. On the other hand going further hack there is very little doubt that Khurma was under the effective jurisdiction of the Saud dynasty in the days of its early greatness and Ibn Sand claims that the long-standing exemption from taxation, which the people of Khurma have enjoyed and still enjoy, was conferred upon them by Saud the Hirst (or possibly Saud the Great, i*e., Saud the Second, the real founder of the Wahhabi Empire). It is fairly certain.that neither the Sheriff nor the Turks have ever collected a mite by way of taxation from the people of Khurma—a fact which goes far to prove their, claim to independence. If that is admitted the people of Khurmaonrmot well be blamed If they choose to place themselves under the suzerainty of a power in which they have confidence and to which they are attached by religious, geographical, racial and other ties and to resist any claim to over- loixhhip by a ruler who has made it clear that he will not tolerate the exercise of their religions according to their own lights. (3) The above remarks I trust will be sufficient to shew that at any rate there is a good case for investigation and that no ex-parte opinion can dispose of it satisfactorily. The two reverses to his aims which I have reported have doubtless proved injurious to the Sheriff’s prestige but he has no one to blame for that hut himself. I note that the High Commissioner considers that the Sneritf regards Khurma as his territory “ apparently with reason ” and that lie does not doubt the sincerity of his assurances that Shakir will not advance east of Khurma to attack Ibn Sand’s subjects. If these remarks are intended to indicate that no action is being or has been taken to prevent the develop- ruent of the Sheriff’s operations and that His Majesty’s Government approve of thus letting events run their course, I can only say I regard the situation with the most lively apprehension. Until the w^orst comes to the worst, however, I cannot believe that His Majesty’s Government after their impartial warning to both rulers to refrain from provocative action will allow one of the recipients of that warning to disregard it in the very matter in respect of , w hich it was issued. The issue of that warning has, as already reported,, had 1 a very favourable i effect on Ibn Saud but he assumes, as I think he is entitled to do, that it will be e^qually effective on the Sheriff. (4) As regards the last paragraph of the telegram under consideration I note that the Sheriff has been warned of possible disturbances on his eastern frontier and that His Majesty’s Government’s first message has been delivered ^ . to him and also that the second message* No. 27 . j u iy 27th has been withheld. : Th^ High Commissioner considers that it would lessen the risk of hostilities if I bn Saud w^ ere required to adopt a “hands off” policy in respect of the + Semi No. 24. Khurma district. In my review,! da fed Under despatch to Government of India, June 25th, I have fully explained anff,^ may now repeat in respect of the subsequent period of neatly two months that Ibn Saud up to date has taken no action whatever in respect of the affairs of Khurma except to forbid the Akhwan of Ghat Ghat to proceed to the rose up of their co-religionists when they w r ere actually on the way and to forbid (ai mv request) the people of Khurma to take any forward action to avenge them- selves on their aggressors. As I have said before he has exercised his, powerful influence in the interests of the preservation of the peace in tne assurance that we would intervene to prevent things going too far. I am unable therefore to see what more the High Commissioner requires of him or what he find^, to blame in Ibn Sand’s past conduct—further more I guarantee that Ibn Saud will faithfully maintain his past policy of non-interference in the affairs of Khurma provided that the Sheriff reciprocates by adopting the same policy. h : A mutual “hands off” policy is the only possible guarantee of the preserv ation of peace. uw Thirdly, as regards High Commissioner’s telegram J of July 31st (Baghdad, No. 6310 of 1st august 1918)— I Serial No. 31. (1) The High Commissioner reports that the attention of the Arabs, of the Hedjaz is turned to Khurma and that the King’s prestige would be gravely affected by the failure of Shakir’s expedition. Mutalis mutandis the samp may be said for Najd, where as I have already reported Ibn baud has, since the first attack on Kliurma, been beset by insistent demands by priests and people, 1 Akhwan and tribesmen, to take immediate action to save Khurma and when his failure to effect that object either through our intervention or hjs own efforts will seriously affect both his prestige and his influence. Incidentally Ibn Baud’s position is even more delicate than that of the Sheriff in view of the attacks on uis other frontier by the Ajtffan. It is not, however, only thp Hedjaz and Najd which are watching the development of the Khurma situation148 • 1 .U • * onrl arxietv The case is unfortunately a “ Cause celehre ” ^nth interest &lt; &gt; . idence to s h 0 w that not only the southern tribt'T on' H djaz P frosier but the Tarkish military authorities iu Asif are watching the situation-in fact Khurma has already rece.ved tinforcemlnts from Bisha and Tathlith and there .9 very serious danger o * widespread 5 conflagration (backed hy the Turks) on the eastern frontier o the liS quite ajJt Horn any action that Ibn SauU may be forced to take, especially it Shakir’s next attack proves unsuccesstul. In fact i am so convinced that Urn Sand is really desirous of peace that- especially in attlcl/again and fails, I shall be able to persuade T^u to^^n one tre chance° of intervening before launching into ■ Vi e but. I am convinced that in such a contingency nothing would Jrove'n' the people of Khurma and their nlundT'to f&lt;How upu’ei 'success. Ibn Sand will certainly not be able to plunder, to x i P wiU have failed to make good Ins guarantee SZZJ™. in tire event of Shakir’s success I fear that nothing will prevent Ibn Sand himself taking immediate action. f‘&gt;) 1 fullv realise the High Commissioner’s anxiety lest the Ktmrma ffotr eliould react prei udicially on the conduct of the Arab operations in the north That L a matter which I am afraid I am not in a position to discuss hut it is my plain duty to point out the probable consequences— as I see them of the SbSfrs persistence in his present course. 1 notice with regret the use bv the High Commissioner of the words “On grounds of practical exoedienev ” for! while 1 fullv realise that, if the obstruction of the designs Mhe Sheriff is likelv to prejudice the operations in the north. His Majesty » ot the Sheriff is liKeiy p^ choose between that risk and the risk of STC a LrCtTe action, I am fully convinced that the treat ment. of the Khurma dispute on any basis other than that of its intrmac merits as between Ibn Sand and the King to the prejudice ot the termer will • followed bv most, disastrous results. As I have already pointed out Ibn L i. - «, 1» K) rT *«f • “21,“ »x maintenance of pt acse pending the consideration ot tlie matter Dy ine British Government, but hefs not a man to be trifled with and, though at the nresent critical moment he is opposing the united will ot his subjects m t e interests of the cause with which he has identified himself, as soon as he realises that we have subordinated his vital interests to the requirements ot our practical expediency he will not hesitate to take his own measures f r protecting them against aggression, fully as he realises that the result will be disastrous to himself whatever the issue. r qj Finally a word as to the '‘activities of Akhwan agents who are evidently at the root of the trouble”. To the best of my belief the somewhat vs.-ue and often reiterated accusation that Akhwan agents have cf tate beeri busy undermining the influence of the Sheriff has now been substantiated. In aD &gt;\ Lase LTloarcely applicable to the case of Khurma whose inhabitants, look stock and barrelf have always been Wahhabis and are all Akhwan and as sue equire no proselytising. The abortive mission of the Sherifflan Qa h. on tb other hand is clear enough evidence that it is the Sheriff who is inter fering with the religious liberty of the peoplp of Khurma Ibis is no me accusation based on Wahhabi reports but is fully home out by the evidence of the letters of the King’s son, Abdulla, of which I l&gt;ave already forwarded translations. Incidentally I may mention that present Wahh ^ priest of Khurma and his father before him have occupied the post without a break for 60 years, the father haying been appointed by Faisal. 1 anoloeise for the inordinate length of this letter and for the ^ re( l u ^ V petition of salient points necessitated by the fact that 1 have considered , iLsf te answer the points raised in the High Commissioner’s telegram^ they occur. It is perhaps to be regies u • Serial No. 24 . tha t my report* of June 25th was no wired to the liigh Commissioner as I feel confident that he would have ta 'en fwnicli the same view of matters as was taken on a perusal of that report by yourself and the Government of India. Nevertheless I have considered it necessary to deal fully in thus note with every point raised in the hope that the extreme gravity of the situation may be realised as also the fact that there is a good case for impartial investigation. I now turn to the detailed explanation of my action (briefly alluded to at the beginning of this report) in not delivering His Majesty’s Government’s * Serial No. 27 . second message conveyed in Secretary of State telegram,* July 27th. Firstly, the first and third sentences are almost verbatim repetitions of parts of the message already delivered to Ibn Saud on behalf of His Majesty’s Government as t Enclosure No. 5 of Serial No. 79 . reported in my telegramf M.-147 of 8th August 1918. Secondly, the full signi ficance of the second sentence was not altogether clear to me and I felt that it would be unwise to convey a message to that effect which I was not in a position to elucidate in the event of Ibn Saud requiring further explanations. With all deference I venture to suggest that the friction existent between the two rulers is due not to the action of intriguing third parties—at least I know of none such—hut to the very real mutual incompatibility of their ambitions or in other words to the dispute over the question of the boundaries of their respective jurisdictions. As regards Ibn Saud I have already indicated that he regards the Sheriff as responsible for the dropping of the proposal for an offensive against Hail on which be counted for a welcome addition to his armament and financial resources. Thirdly, as already indicated the fourth sentence of the message containing a demand that Ibn Saud should write to the King was what deterred me from delivering the message as I feared that it might undo the good already done by the delivery of the first message, which in itself has produced the desired effect so far as Ibn Saud is concerned. I was not authorised to inform Ibn Saud that a similar demand (as regards the writing of a letter to himself) was being made to the Sheriff and in any case J Serial No. 30 . v ^ ew Cairo telegram{ of July 30th I could uot conscientiously have done so. I thus feared that Ibn Saud might consider this part of the message as being couched in less impartial terms than its predecessor and might think be w r as being jokered into giving way to the Sheriff. Nevertheless I was fully alive to the fact that if a friendly interchange of letters took place the tension might be relieved and I decided if possible to secure the desired result by more devious means. Accordingly at an interview on the afternoon of the 11th (the day I received the telegram in question) I discussed the matter of the Khurma dispute with Ibn Saud and took an opportunity to point out that while the British Government had the points at issue between him and the Sheriff under their lively consideration, their ultimate object went much further than the mere settlement of such disputes and envisaged a nearer approach to real friendship between two rulers whom they had in high regard. I then explained that he must realise that the Sheriff by his active participation with us in hostilities against the Turks had a peculiar claim on our consideration, &amp;c., &amp;c. 1 then put it to him that any practical contribution on his part to the re-establish men t of good relations would he a fitting corollary to his letter in reply to His Majesty’s Government’s last message and that, as Shakir’s threatened opeiations had not yet materialis ed, it was up to him to endeavour by friendly means to deter the Sheriff from his puipose. He expressed his conviction that nothing would deter the Sheriff ‘from that except cur active interventiou and I replied that at any rate he w ould make such inteivention easier for us by adopting a conciliatory attitude towards the Sheriff. At length after much heating about the hush I suggested that the only w T ay cut of the difficulty was for him to write to the Sheriff but that in the circumstances 1 would not press him to do so. As 1 fully expected he immediately stiffened and declared that that w r as impossible in view of the Sheriff’s leplies to his previous and especially his last letters (vide para- Mcmoranduins Nos. ]3742, Julj ith, to Caiio; ai.d g 1 S p ll 9 of ny M.-// cf June 25th). I urged that the situation was serious enough to warrant desperate remedies 13767,§ July 9th, to India. § Serial No. 24.150 and that, so far as I could see, while 1 fully sympathised wilt his reluctance to risk another rebuff, no harm could be done by wr.ting a letter now while much good might result. However, he did not seem inclined to accept the advice and I deemed it expedient to drop the matter so I left him with a nartincr request to think seriously over my proposal or any alternative that might suggest itself to him. All yesterday he studiously avoided anything Hkf a private interview with me and the matter was not discussed; to-day ooked like being a repetition of yesterday but at 5 J-. M. he sent for me and after a little beating about the bush he informed me that after considering toe matter fully he'had come to the conclusion that perhaps it would be better that he should write as I had suggested though he did not think that any good would result from it. He suggested that tie should send the letter throut-h you but I advised that, the more spontaneous it appeared to be the better the chance of its meeting with a measure of success. I asked him, owever, to let me have a copy to send to you for information and to this he madilv agreed. He then dictated in my presence the let.er of which I forward a conv herewith and which will be despatched to-morrow to the Sheri If. It w not 1 admit, as effusive as one might wish but that fact in itself saves it from any suspicion of being a formal letter written under pressure and though I suggested a few minor modifications which he accepted I thought it might be dangerous to appear to be dictating the letter myself. The letter as ,t stand, goes'to the point and is conciliatory and above all gives the Sheriff an oppor tunity of graceful reciprocation both in word and action. As such I trust it will be viewed with approval as a sign of Ibn Saud s genuine desire for the mam- Tena. ce of peace and friendly relations with the Sheriff. Though the idea of writino- was suggested by me the decision to do so was entirely spontaneous after an obvious struggle with conflicting emotions and I venture to submit that Ibn Saud hv writing such a letter and holding out the olive branen has irone so far as his self respect will allow or we can expect him to and is entitled f„ the gratitude of His Majesty’s Government. If the Sheriff declines to reci procate his advances and insists on pursuing the path of provocation, Ibn Saud will scarcely be to blame for the consequences and I sincerely trust that every effort will be made to make the Sheriff take advantage of the very easy way out of his difficulties thus opened up before him. In my M.-147* of 8th August 1918, I have suggested what seems to me J to be a reasonable temporary settlement • Enclosure No. 5 of Serial No. 79. 0 f p 0 i n ts at isSUC between the tWO mlers and I still think that that course would be the saiest to adopt, but it His Majesty’s Government are of opinion that an attempt should be made to solve tue boundary question at once I would suggest that some responsible representative of the High Commissioner should meet me in the neighbourhood of Khurma and that we should jointly make proposals. If we a o-reed on all essential points neither the Sheriii: nor Ibn Saud could reasonably obiect to a hnal decision bv His Majesty’s Government in accordance with our report while if we disagreed it would be open to His Majesty’s Government to pass final orders or to postpone decision till after the war when a proper boundary commission might be appointed. I am convinced that Ibn Saud would a°Tee to any of these alternatives—indeed he all along has been not less anxious than myself that a responsible representative of the High Commissioner should join the Mission. p. p.—I should he obliged if I may Have a copy of a translation of Ibn Sand’s letter to the Sheriff, which I hope will be very carefully translated.

Following is position as regards His Majesty’s Government. On 14th January Secretary of State wired as follows:— Begins. His Majesty^s Government consider that it is not necessary or desirable to give Ibn Saiid military assistance on scale proposed and that it will suffice for the present to dole out money to him in such quantities as Cox may think desir able to kfeep him in play pending development of military situation. Please instruct Cox accordingly. He will recognise need for discretion in carrying out instructions as it is most undesirable that Arabs should suspect us of being lukewarm in support of Ibn Saud against Ibn Easbid. Ends. As it was clear that this telegram bad been drafted before receipt of a number of telegrams from me repeating your messages, I wired on January I6th, asking them to consider further hy the light of the fresh material which had How reached them.

From remark of Bin Saud to me I do not gather that he is altogether pleased with attempts to effect co-ordination between himself and Sheriff and he does not want either latter or Egypt to be involved with him. As a result of Philby’s journey he rather thinks that we are trying to conciliate Sheriff at his expense. Direction taken by Bin Saud with Turki and following on leaving Riyadh was north-eastward and suspect there is some idea of eventually moving in Ajman locality.” Please repeat to Philby I do not know his whereabouts.

In view of my recent reports unnecessary to say much. Khurrua is one of matters in dispute between Sheriff and Ibn Sand and latter is prepared to submit matter to adjudication of British Government, and till matter decided Sheriff has no right to take matters into his own hands while Ibn Saud is quietly obeying injunction of British Government. Re-occupation of or further attempt to re-occupy Khurraa will certainly be regarded by Ibn Saud as casus belli. Trust definite assurances will be given without delay and Abdulla’s force withdrawn from Ashaira, Marran, &amp;c., as it constitutes quite unnecessary provocation and menace to Ibn Saud. I can guarantee immunity of Sheriff’s territory from attack by latter if any fears expressed on that score. Reference High Commissioner’s last sentence.

Sir With reference to your letter of the 29th November, 1918, No. 196067/W.44, transmitting copy of a telegram from His Majesty’s High Commissioner for Egypt regarding the activities of Bin Saud, Emir of Nejd, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to invite attention to the marginally-noted telegram from of which was communicated to your Department on the Xnd instant, conveying the comments of Mr. Philby,- lately Political Officer attached to Bin Saud, on Sir R. Wingate’s message. It does not appear to Mr. Secretary Mentagu, on the evidence before him, that there are any strong grounds for addressing further representations to Bin Saud at the present juncture. Sir. R. Wingate gives no indication of the date on which reports of Bin Saud’s aggressive intentions first gained jy; but it appears certain that je rumours owe their origin to # No. 10493, 29th November, 1918. the Civil Commissioner, Baghdad”, copy anyany spacific action on Bin Saudis part, it must b© to action tak©n befor© tne new situation arising out of the Turkish d§b&amp;cle had fully developed, or at any rate before its effects had become manifest in Central Arabia.

High Conimissioner, Cairo's teltfgrtefi^to^ Foreign Office 1765. 26th November. Philby's comment from Basra as follows. Belyis. Firstly, Ibn Baud's complaint (s) regarding Sherriff's persistent aggression against Khurrna have remained unheeded. Sharif ! s policy has steadily alienated s^mipathies of all Badawin elements. In circumstances it is inevitable that Ibn Saud mil receive great accession of strength Sharif ceasing to pay Badamn mercenaries. Secondly. Shakir ! s admission of fourth unsuccessful attack on Khuma will not improve matters. Thirdly, reference to Sharif f s alleged orders-to Shakir to avoid bloodshed yesterday. I have posted literal translation of Sharif’s ( O roup omitted) to Shakir dated about 1st September and apparently (? captured) with booty at third , KV defeat. Sharif^ (corrupt grouff) letter boasts of having returned Ibn Saud 1 s letter unopened and. of having threate ned latter’s messenger. He adds 'if you capture Khurma do not go beyond it until fully consolidated and be very careful of guns'. Tone of letter does not suggest anxiety to avoid bloodshed. Fourthly, as you know, I regard eventual conflict inevitable if Sher|iff pursues present policy and H.U. G-ovemment decline t.o intervene. Personally I regard issue doubtful while consequence of Ibn Baud’s success would be far reaching. Fifthly, it seems to me that only possible chance of averting disaster is either that K. 11.Government should intervene to prohibit Sherriff from further aggression pending 11 l ' arbitration of Boundary Commission or that Sherriff n .M. Government should accord definite recognition of Ibn Saud's suzerainty over Khurrna.' Either course would fully satisfy Ibn Saud. If Shakar remains (corrupt group) round Khuma Ibn Saud cannot long maintain patience. Ends.

It would then be in the hand of God to support or reduce one of us as He may be pleased to do. / But at present we list^Lto your orders, and shall not make any move,neither ory part of us nor on the part of l our subjects. If he aihers to your orders it will be much A the bet ter, but if he disobey© them and encroaches upon us, we will be obliged to punish him in return. You made enquiries from us Its to what was the original cause for oar enmity to the Sharif. In reply we know of no original reasons beyond what ws art mentioning hereafter (1) In the beginning, our ancestors were very friendly with his Hohammad ibn ’On,’Abdallah ibn ’On, ’On-er-^afi’, and ’All Pasha were allied with us and we were each supporting the other. But the Turks made an attempt to separate us from one another, and we Sherlfs adhered to the Turks by feres,by their tongues and by their actions, although we were each confident of one another. On the outbreak of trouble between Abdul Hamid and the C.U*P.,the latter made an attempt to indues Sharif Abdallah (who died at Constantinople) to go out and make an agreement with Ibn Hashid against us. 3harif Abdallah having refused to execute their wishes,they tried Sharif Hossain, who after giving them an undertaking to combine with Ibn Rashid against us,made zhe trouble which is not hidden from your knowledge. He firstly went out towards Najd.Being at that time in friendly relations with him,we deputed Sa^ ibn Abdur- Hahman to go to him for an explanation,when the Sharif seised and imprisoned him,and made some demands from us. Being at that time forced to keep hirs away from us,owing il ■o to hi* motive movementtook precautionary measuree and settled our political matter* aMc&amp;bly. r hen matters were settled we made him understand that we mould not tolerate his unjustifiable intrigues* It wat then that enmity between him and us arose. Mf h*n Ood caused him to fall in troubles with the Turks - in the time of the Turkish Veil of Mjas.Wahlfe Beg- he was obliged to come to an understand ing with us in order to preserve hie own interests* :f e then aa a result agreed with each other. But when the *Aiman trouble arose and indidents took place at A1 Hassa and when Ibn Rashid betrayed the inhabitants of Al-qesim not withstanding the treaty he made with us # the ^arif,acting in accordance with a compact between them, deputed his son Abdallah with a view to oeouping 14ajd* At that time he demonstrated his enmity to our religion and to our wordly ambitions, and wrote many provocative letters to the natives of hajd, one of them being a letter to Ibn Darwish* The latter letter w© have handed to you,the remainder will, God wills,be handed to you assoon as we have found them This is the history of our relations with him, from the beginning up to the end. As a matter of fact, he is a man fond of intrigues. Fe loves to mix himself up with the affairs of Arabs.This may be accounted for by the fact that the British have supported his paramount sovereigty over the Arabs, fleeing that the Arabs have paid no heed to his claim to sovereignty over them and seeing that we and the other Arab Chieftains refuse to recognise him as a paramount sovereign owing to his opposition to our religion and woj^ly affairs he is now making the desparate efforts that we see. But as you know the Arabs still follow the example of their forbears. Having realised that you have sympathy for the Arabs and are tlying to unite them and leave the rulers to enjoy their Chieftainships, juet as you have done with the Hajas of India, and etc., we wore confident that you would notforct us, or force others,to undergo new changes contrary to A* the Customs to which the Arabs have been subjected. Ths Sharif by his intrigues,hopes to make mischief between 3 as so that he may achieve his ajabitionu, in your name But we thank God for the confidence we have that you will not allow us to be suffer any prejudice through yourselves,while on the other hand you know,and every 1 wise man knows, that it is our duty to uphold and preserve our honour(which, by the support of God, is the source of our maintenance) and to refuse to subjects ourselves to what our forefathers have never been subjected. we, your friend, have rather answered at length, but it was necessary to do so in order to derive advantage and in order that you may know 4rr state of affairs as it stands now- This is what had to be explained. T/ay you be preserved. ( Seal ) Dated 2nd. Dhil -^idah, 1336 15th.

BRITISH COMMITMENTS TO BIN SAUD. BIN SAUD is the hereditary ruler of the Wahabi State of Nejd (capital Er-Riadh). Early in the nineteenth century his ancestors, under the impetus of the Puritanical reli gious movement of which they were the champions, spread their power widely over the surrounding tribes and oases, and ruled for a moment from the Persian Gulf to the Red Sea. Later in the century they suffered adversity. Their power was broken by Mehemet Ali. The hegemony of Central Arabia passed to the rival Bin Rashid house of Jebel Shammar (capital Hail), and in 1871 the Turks planted garrisons in the al-Hasa province, along the Gulf Coast between Koweit and al-Katar. The Bin Saud power was confined to the. interior, and during this period there was practically no contact between it and His Majesty’s Government. The situation was radically altered, however, by two events in 1913. In May that year Abd-ul-Aziz Bin Saud, the reigning prince of that house, expelled the Turkish garrisons from Hasa and reoccupied the coast. And on the 29th July His Majesty’s Government signed a Convention with Turkey, in which they recognised as belonging to the “.Ottoman Sanjak of Nejd ” the coastline and interior west of a line drawn north and south from a point on the mainland opposite Zakhnuniyah Island (Gulf of Bahrein) to latitude 20 ° in the Ruba-al-Khali desert (Article 11 ). This conjunction of events placed His Majesty’s Government in a difficult position. Since Bin Saud had become not merely the ruler of a section of the Gulf Coast, but the most powerful of all the local rulers, it was inevitable that His Majesty’s Government should have direct relations with him over the arms traffic, British trade, and his dealings with neighbouring Arab States (Koweit, Katar, Trucial Chiefs, &amp;c.) already in treaty relations with His Majesty’s Government. On the other hand, Bin Saud’s de facto independence in Hasa was not recognised by Turkey, and we had agreed with the Turkish Government to regard his coast and country as Turkish territory, and himself, by implication, as a Turkish subject. On the instructions of Sir P. Cox, at that time British Resident in the Persian Gulf, the British Residents at Koweit (Captain Shakespear) and Bahrein met Bin Saud on the 15th and 16th December, 1913. At this meeting Bin Saud invited His Majesty’s Government to keep the peace on his coast, showed the British representatives the draft agreement which the Turks were trying to make him accept, and practically asked for British mediation (6117/1990/14). The Turkish conditions communicated to us by Bin Saud were as follows :— 1. The readmission of the Turkish garrisons to the province and coast of Hasa, as formerly. 2. The appointment of Kazis and other judicial officers by direct “ farmans” issued by the Sultan. 3. The payment by Bin Saud of annual revenue of XT. 3,000. 4. The reference of all communications from foreign Powers or their representatives to the Turkish authorities for disposal. 5. The exclusion of all foreign merchants and agents from the province. 6. An undertaking from Bin Saud not to give concessions to any foreign companies for railways or motor-car services. On the 9th March, 1914, the Foreign Office presented a memorandum to Hakki Pasha, who was at that time conducting negotiations in London on behalf of the Turkish Government, in which the difficulty of His Majesty’s Government’s position in regard to Bin Saud was explained, the Turkish conditions cited (without the source of our information being stated), and a protest made against the last three of them (10569/14). In this memorandum British desiderata in regard to Bin Saud, subject, of course, to the Anglo-Turkish Convention of the 29th July, 1913, were defined as follows :— 1. That he should not meddle in the territory or politics of Arab principalities in the Gulf, including Trucial Coast and Katar. [939] B2 2 . That, like other Sheikhs on the Arab jf ofy^Tn^rpurdfoTrteAribal hostilities by the passage of armed 4 . CEj^tXr^ould b^SfaX^ S anfproperly treated ' while there.

Three Arabic letters were accordingly drafted at Koweit, one by the British Besident ^pind the other two by the Sheikh (82216/14), in which Bin Saud was addressed in the sense of the India Office instructions and was informed of Captain Shakespear’s mission. These letters were despatched on the 15th October, 1914. In answer to them, Bin Saud wrote letters on the 24th October, 1914, to the Political Resident in the Gulf and to Captain Shakespear himself. The letter to Captain Shakespear was conveyed through Bin Sand’s lieutenant on the Hasa coast, and the latter was instructed to arrange a meeting for him with Captain Shakespear when that officer arrived (5353/1385/15). Meanwhile, on the 14th September, 1914, the Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf had submitted to the Government of India drafts of letters and notices to the different Gulf Chiefs, which he had prepared for the event of war between Great Britain and Turkey, and which he proposed to issue upon the receipt of intelligence that war had broken out (64214/61439/14). The draft letter to Bin Saud (which was to follow a brief circular announcing that a state of war existed between Great Britain and Turkey) ran as follows :— “ In continuation of my previous letter, informing your Excellency of the outbreak of war between Great Britain and Turkey, I am authorised by my Government to request your Excellency to co-operate with our honoured friends, their Excellencies the Sheikhs of Koweit and Mohammerah, in the capture of Basrah from the Turks or, should such a task be beyond your united powers, which seems unlikely, that you should make such arrangements, especially above Gurna'u, as may prevent assistance reaching Basrah, until such time as the British arrive and take over the city. Consistently with your main object, viz., the capture or isolation of Basrah, we request your Excellency to take all measures in your power to prevent the plundering of British merchants and property in the town of Basrah itself and in the neighbourhood. The personal safety of the Europeans should also be a special objecr of your solicitude. “ In return for this valuable co-operation, I am authorised by my Government to assure your Excellency that, in the event of our success—and succeed we shall, insha Allah—Basrah will never again be allowed to be subject to Turkish authority. c&lt; I am further to assure your Excellency that the British Government will guarantee your Excellency— “ 1 . Against all reprisals by the Turks in consequence of these measures ; “ 2. Against attack by sea ; and “ 3. That they will be prepared to recognise your Excellency as independent Ruler of Nejd and al-Hasa, and to enter into treaty relations with your Excellency. “ I am also directed to request your Excellency to turn the Turkish garrisons of al-Hasa and al-Qatif out of your territory.” This draft was approved in due course by the Government of India and the India Office, and the letter seems to have been released for delivery on the 3rd November, 1914 (82713/61439/14 : pp. 7 - 8 , 15-6, and 17). The three assurances contained in it became the basis of the subsequent negotiations. Bin Sand’s reply, dated the 28th November, 1914 (17000/1385/15: No. 46) was phrased as follows :— “We have received your august communication dated the 3rd November, 1914, in which you state that your honour has already mentioned in your previous letter that the exalted Government of Great Britain has declared war against the Ottoman Government, and that you have been ordered by the illustrious Govern ment to invite us to co-operate with the Sheikh of Mohammerah and the Ruler of Koweit—our cordial friends and sincere allies—and attack Basrah The co-operation with the above-mentioned two friends is incumbent upon us (and so is it for us to) use our good offices with our friends, the illustrious Government, in all useful actions which may be required by her. And I am using my endeavours and efforts in furthering the common interests of all friends. You should rest fully assured and be confident in this question.“ I am one of the greatest helpers to the Government of Great Britain, and Tsingl Te of them to remain (in these parts) after our occupation, and have turned them all . hree matterg me ntioned by you, namely the promise of the exalted Government 8 to protect and safeguard us against the Ottoman Lihi « &gt;11 [~1&gt; »f Nejl .1-Hm &gt;nd Q.lrf, th, am leaving my • nrr |p r +V,at we may earn the approval ot make the necessary verbal negotiations, m order » y r^nvp.rnment of Great Britain. No further steps were taken on th^ Brtoh side till Captain f ^e^pear travelling Bahrein and Koweit, reached Bm bauds camp on ' 304 During ^he next'^few days he discussed exhaustively with Bin Sand the latter’s iJur g f -RrUoin and Turkey since their previous meeting a year before. Bin Saud 7etreT^ ^ad received from representatives of Great Britatn duSg the past three months, and dwelt especially upon the letter of the 3 rd Novembe?, VJU, from the Officiating Besident in the Gulf. He cited the three assurances contained in it, but remarked that “ the document was a vague letter, did not specify whether the assurances were limited merely to the present war or also included the future, gave no hi t whether other conditions 1 would be required of himself later and could not b* regarded as a binding instrument between the two parties for the future. Captain Shakespear concluded from these conversations that Bin Saud “ had no intention of abandoning his neutral position, with freedom to make his own arrangements with the Turks (and he was confident that he could secure from them a very good ‘ second best’) until he held a signed and sealed treaty with the British Government ; nor would he move a step further towards making matters either easier for us or more difficult for the Turks so far as the present war was concerned, until he obtained in that treaty some very solid guarantee of his position, with Great Britain practically as his suzerain.” Captain Shakespear therefore asked Bin Saud to draw up “ a preliminary draft, containing what he was prepared to accept and what he desired, which he (Captain Shakespear) might then forward to His Majesty’s Government for their consideration This suggestion was promptly carried out by Bin Saud, and in a report, dated the 4 th January, 1915, to Sir P. Cox (in which the foregoing conversations were also put on record) Captain Shakespear submitted a rough translation of Bin Saud’s desiderata « xhe clauses which will be reasons for a binding agreement between myself (‘ Bin Saud ’) and the Great British Government “ 1 That the British Government will acknowledge and admit that Nejd, al-Hasa, Qatif, their surroundings and the ports appertaining to them on the shores of the Persian Gulf are to me and (are) the territory of my fathers and forefathers ; that I am the independent ruler of them, and after me my sons and their descendants by inheritance; and that the above-mentioned territory is an independent territory in which there is no (right of) interference to any foreign Power. “ 2 . That they (the British Government) will declare its (the territory s) boundaries north, south, east, and west, by land and by sea, and that (regarding) the nomads who wander between neighbouring towns, which are either under British protection or (directly) under British Government, if there should arise differences between me and the chiefs of the said towns and complaints be made m (these) matters, they should be decided according to the ownership of fathers and ancestors.“ 3 . That all existing jurisdiction in all my territories shall continue^ in accordance with the laws of the sacred Mohammedan Shariat, according to the sect of Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal-as-Salafi, and all who dwell therein shall be subject to them in all matters or (shall be subject) to the customary law of the towns in which they may be, » whether my own subjects or the subjects of States adjacent to my territories—by reason of religious obligation we are helpless without it nor can we exceed it. _ # “ 4 . There shall be no permission to any foreigner to acquire a hand s-breadth of my territories (within the defined) boundaries, not even by a substitute, except after reference to myself and with my permission. “ 5 . After acknowledgment of the above clauses, that she (Great Britain) will promise to prevent and to defend from all oppression and aggression which may come upon or happen to my territories by land or by sea, from whatever Power it may be. “ 6 . That she (Great Britain) will promise that she will not permit nor encourage nor accord sanctuary to accused persons or fugitives from our territories, whether townsmen or nomads. _ ( “ 7 . That she (Great Britain) will respect and protect the rights of my subjects, and deal with them as she deals with her own subjects while they may be (resident) in her territories and dependencies. “ 8 . If she (Great Britain) accepts and acknowledges the foregoing clauses, then I accept and acknowledge severance of dealings with any other Power in all (matters of) concessions, interference, and intercourse, except with reference to the Great British Government. “ 9 . I bind myself to protect trade within my territories from all aggression, and that I will deal (with her subjects) according to the treatment my own subjects receive in all matters of government and business m er (Great Britain’s) countries and dependencies. “ 10 . I bind myself to the protection (in) the coasts and ports which are under my Government from all aggression to the subjects of the British Government and those under their protection. “11. I will forbid the traffic in arms and ammunition, whether by a Govern ment or by (way of) merchandise, from all the ports which are under m y Government, on condition that if I should be in need of anything in arms and ammunition I will refer to the British Government m order to obtain my wants.” In forwarding this document, Captain Shakespear added some observations of his own, which have still, after four years, an important bearing on the eventual settlement of our permanent relations witb Bin Saud after the war . “I venture to submit that Bin Saud, in effect, asks for little more than what has been already conveyed in the Acting Resident’s assurances if these were meant to apply to the future and were not limited to the present crisis, and i they are interpreted liberally and generously. In exchange, Bm au o ers o make himself a British vassal for good. The addition to our responsibilities does not appear heavy :— “(a.) The Turkish menaces from the west and north of Nejd, though very real to Bin Saud, need give us no anxiety—we have no reason to suppose they will be more successful in the future than they have been within the last two or three decades, while,_ guaranteed from attack by sea, Bin Saud will be in a far better position to meet them than was possible hitherto. Should they become threatening, strong diplomatic representations would probably suffice to prevent any attempt on a scale with which Bin Saud could not cope himself. “ (b.) We should probably be called upon to act as arbiters somewhat more frequently than hitherto between the Arab Sheikhs along the coast and Bin Saud, a duty largely to the advantage of our own interests. * * Three weeks later, on the 24th January, 1915, Captain Shakespear was kil }ed in a battle between Bin Saud and Bin Rashid, at which he had insisted on being present. No blame attaches to Bm Saud for this lamentable event.“ On the other hand, the advantages seem to be considerable «( a .) Complete control of the Arabian littoral of the Persian Gulf. “ (b) Similar complete control of the arms trarhc. . n , &lt;‘(c.) The practical exclusion of foreign Powers and influence in Cental “ (d ) The^security induced by British suzerainty and ‘Bin Sand’s’ strong ( ’ control of the Bedouin tribes will give a great impetus to trade through the Persian Gulf ports, probably diverting a share of what “ (r ) ThTg^UnflurcfB^Saud has over'Mohammedan opinion in Arabia an mfluence likely to increase as the Turkish Empire breaks up a d the Khalifate of the Sultan is questioned, will be a British asset. “(f) Bin Saud’s influence with all Arab tribes, and particularly with the {f ' Northern Anazah, with whom our occupation of Lower Mesopotamia will bring us m close contact. Upon receipt of Captain Shakespear’s report. Sir R Cox 16th Tanuarv 1915 to the Government ol India (17000/ld85/15 . . ) y if Bin Saul’s’ desiderata, and made the following further suggestions “ Bin Sand should undertake :— Fi rs t—To receive representative of British Government either at his capital^ s^ea-portm- both, rf ( d t ® S ) lre e d xtra . territoriality for our non-Mohammedan 3Uh ^Thirdly.—yo abstain from waging war by sea without our consent, and to co-operate for the suppression of piracy. _ . , . •, “ Fourthly .—To protect pilgrim traffic passing through his territory. ^ To levy customs dues at rates which we consider reasonable, having; regard to rate prevailing at Bahrein and Koweit. _ “Sixthly.—To allow British merchant vessels to visit his ports. “ Seventhly —To agree to locate post office and possibly telegraph office at his port when the time comes.” “I do not include any item regarding slave trade, as that is not now a serious difficulty, and has given us no trouble at Koweit. “ Only point regarding which it seems necessary to offer comment here is the question o'f protection against external aggression by land. When we ynyited Bin Baud to move on Basrah, we undertook to protect him against reprisals by Turks, so that, as far as latter are concerned, what Bin Baud now asks us to give does not amount to much more. Apart from Turks, Central Arabia is practical y inaccessible by land to any Power but ours, and I venture to think that we should incur little risk by giving the desired undertaking, subject to (the) reservation that aggression be unprovoked. . . f . . “We have publicly declared that our object is to effect liberation of Arabs from oppressive yoke (of) Turkey. In this case there is no question of annexation of territory to which our allies could take exception, while Bin baud s weight m scale would be no mean asset to joint cause of us all. Can I possibly be auth°f ls “ to draft a treaty on above lines for negotiation by Captain Shakespear . I sba not now have the opportunity of meeting Bin Baud myself. “ I am obliged to give Bin Baud some reply by his messenger, who has orders to return at once. I am sending Captain Shakespear purport of above a dd ; tl0 “ a ' points and asking him to use his discretion m discussing them with Bin baud, io Bin Baud I am replying that I hope that an instrument safeguarding his position can be arrived at somewhat on lines indicated, and that I have telegraphed t Government on subject, but that treaty must necessarily take a little time draw up.” « On the 29th January, 1915, after further correspondence with Sir P. Cox &lt;21633/15, Nos. 3 and 8 ), the Viceroy telegraphed to the India Office as f &lt;11837/1385/15):— “ In order to expedite settlement, Bin Sand has himself submitted memo^ randum setting forth tentatively his proposals for formulation of treaty.include many matters of detail, fraught with difficulty and requiring ripe con sideration—for instance, definition of boundaries, law and jurisdiction, harbouring of refugees, reciprocal treatment of subjects, arms traffic, and arms facilities. “We consider early conclusion of treaty with Bin Baud most important, but that, for the present, it should be on broad lines somewhat similar to the original Afghanistan agreement with Abdur Rahman, and suggest following :— “ 1 . British Government recognises Bin Baud as independent ruler of Is T ejd, Hasa, and Katif, and guarantees hereditary succession to his dynasty, subject to the acceptance of successors by tribesmen and approval of His Majesty’s Government; “ 2 . In the event of unprovoked aggression on his territories by any foreign Power, British Government are prepared to aid Bin Baud to such extent and in such manner as the situation may require ; “ 3. In return, Bin Baud agrees to have no dealings with any other foreign Power, nor grant concessions to subjects of any other foreign Power, except on the advice of the British Government, which advice he will unreservedly follow ; “ 4. British Government and Bin Baud agree to conclude, as soon as this can he arranged, a detailed treaty in regard to other matters jointly concerning them. “ Cox agrees that a preliminary treaty on these lines would meet the case, and thinks Bin Baud would accept it. Dynastic guarantee of some kind would probably be essential.* That proposed appears sufficiently guarded.” On the 30th January, 1915, the India Office communicated this telegram to the Foreign Office with the following observations (11837/1385/15):— “ The desirability of concluding a treaty with Amir Abdul Aziz follows not merely from the exigencies of the moment, which make it necessary to pay an immediate price for his friendship, but also from the general situation that will be created in the Persian Gulf in the event, as the result of the present war, of the disappearance of Turkish rule from Basra, to which His Majesty’s Government are pledged. It may be anticipated that the Amir of Nejd will be left the master not only of Central Arabia, but also of a long strip of the coast, and in the interest of peace and order it will be essential for the Power that controls the Gulf to have a working arrangement with him. The extent, therefore, to which his claims must be met must be measured not only by the immediate services which he is expected to render, but also by the potential power for mischief which, in the event of success, he will possess, and if permanently estranged will doubtless exercise. “ As regards the terms of the treaty suggested by the Government of India, the dynastic pledge is undoubtedly the crux, but safeguarded in the manner proposed it appears to be free from reasonable objection. It is, however, more than probable that the condition that the successor must be accepted by the tribesmen will be a stumbling-block to Bin Baud, as it was to the Sheikh of Mohammerah, in whose case His Majesty’s Government, under the pressure of the war, have recently approved its abolition. Moreover, regard being had to the very large area over which Bin Baud is to rule and the notoriously factious temper of the Arabs, it may be very difficult to fulfil in practice. We must therefore be prepared for opposition from Bin Baud, and the Marquess of Crewe would not let the negotiations break down over this point. “ The guarantee against unprovoked aggression should, in his Lordship’s opinion, be so worded as to make His Majesty’s Government sole judges of the nature and extent of the assistance to be given. “ Subject to these remarks Lord Crewe commends the proposals of the Government of India to Sir E. Grey’s favourable consideration. It is a question whether, in view of the importance of our eventual relations with Bin Baud, the present treaty should not contain a clause binding him (subject to an agreement as to boundaries in the detailed treaty to be concluded later) to abstain from inter ference with Koweit, Bahrein, al-Katar, and the Trucial Chiefs. His Lordship would propose to suggest this to the Government of India, but to leave it to their discretion. * The Turks had given Bin Sand a dynastic guarantee in their Treaty of the 15th May, 1914.M • “ 9 3. 4. -r, i i q i ^ thp India Office with the concurrence of the Foreign Office^nj^ructed^the'viceroy, in the sense of the above letter, as follows (11837/15; 14168/15) . r “Your proposals are approved subject to o owing remar s . ■ - , g— —ta •'' rsJ &gt;*—“ break down over this P 011 ^; Sheikh of Koweit to ask for similar You are presuma 7 PEfP ^ ^ Sheikh of Mohammerah have it. guarantee when both Bin Saud t WO rded as to make Pledge against unprovoked aggressmn sho exteil t of His Majesty’s Government sole judges ox assistance. should not contain clause binding BTsaTsubjlct to eventual definition of boundaries not to interfere vdk^Koweit, Bahrein, al Katar, and Trucial Chiefs.

About the same time (43530/15: No. 14) Bin Sand wrote to ® lr J’ in view of Captain Shakespear’s death, either that another officer should be depu or that negotiations should be continued by correspondence direct from Basra, a Vi&amp; K Onthe 24th February, 1915, in reporting this request to the Government of India, Sir P. Cox made the following proposal “ I would propose now to send him draft treaty which was awaitmg despatch through Shakespear, together with Viceroy’s letter. In doing so 1 would adv^e him to sign it without delay, and say that, as soon as it is completed, an officer can then be deputed to discuss details of second treaty. The Government of India instructed Sir P. Cox to act as he proposed, and on tho 28th February, 1915, this was reported by the Viceroy to the India Office ( / ; Sir P Cox’s draft and the Viceroy’s letter were accordingly forwarded to bm Saud and two letters, both dated the 24th April, 1915, and addressed respe^velj to the Viceroy and Sir P. Cox, were eventually received m reply from Bin B (1 ^ 1 In^his letter to Sir P. Cox, Bin Saud enclosed a signed copy ot the Arabic version of the treaty. But, to quote his words— 'CLUJ . ^ H ^ r* “ Certain modifications (which are not important) were found cogent reasons, necessitated by local conditions, the need to reassuretants and the governing family of Bin Sand, and also in view of the knowledge we possess as to the circumstances of the Arabs.” Sir Percy Cox replied to Bin Saud as follows in a letter dated the ‘26th June, ^1915':— “ As regards the treaty, I have understood what you wrote, explaining that you had made certain modifications in the text. I have not the least doubt that we shall succeed in adjusting the wording of the articles into a form which will suit both parties and safeguard the interests of yourself and us ; but, as the wording was difierent to what the Government had approved previously, it has been necessary for me to refer it to them.” On the same date he forwarded to the Government of India translations of his own and Bin Saud’s drafts in parallel columns, adding a schedule of Bin Sand’s alterations, and commenting upon them. It may be convenient to set out the two versions in this memorandum :— British draft. Bin Baud's draft. In the name of God the Merciful and In the name of God the Merciful and Compassionate.

(Seal of Abdul Aziz-bin-Abdur Bahman-bin-F aisal-bin-Saud.) Sir P. Cox’s letter and enclosures were received by the Government of India on the 5th July, 1915, and on the 7th July, 1915, the Viceroy telegraphed as follows to the India Office :— “We have carefully examined modifications proposed by Bin Saud in the preliminary treaty sent to him by Cox for acceptance. These modifications are or the most part unimportant. Important modifications are :•— “In article 1, he omits words ‘subject to approval of British Goyernmen after consultation with them ’ in regard to selection of successor. Cox thinks a Bin Saud will accept our wording or some other suitable phrase when our mo ive is explained. If, however, he refuses, we think we might give way on this pom . “Article 2, as modified by Bin Saud, reads: ‘ In the event of aggression Y any foreign Power on territories of countries belonging to the said Bin Sau an his descendants, British Government will aid Bin Saud in all circumstances an in any place,’ thus omitting the word ‘ unprovoked,’ and entirely altering the wor ^ ‘to such extent and in such manner as situation may seem * to them to ^ e d uir ^'i We think word ‘unprovoked’ or some similar term should be inserted, an WC j U e suggest words ‘ to such extent and in such manner as may be expedient, m p a of Bin Sand’s suggestion.“ In article 4, he adds that he will follow the advice of His Majesty’s Govern ment £ where his interests require it.’ Cox suggests ‘ where his interests are not injured thereby,’ and this seems unobjectionable. “ Cox proposes to arrange a meeting shortly with Bin Sand to adjust differences. We think he should be authorised to do so, and to negotiate a treaty on lines above indicated, subject to ratification by Government of India.” On the 11th August, 1915, the India Office communicated to the Foreign Office copies of this telegram and of the documents received from Sir P. Cox, and submitted a draft telegram of instructions to the Viceroy. In their covering letter explaining the grounds of the instructions proposed in this draft, the India Office laid particular stress upon Bin Baud’s omission of the words “ subject to the approval of His Majesty’s Government,” at the end of article 1 :— “ It is ordinarily the policy of His Majesty’s Government to recognise only the de facto ruler, and to avoid giving dynastic guarantees; and the rare exceptions which they have made have been in cases—such as that of Mohammerah—where their relations with the ruler have been of long standing, and where the responsi bilities undertaken are limited. Neither of these conditions is present in the case of Bin Saud, and Mr. Chamberlain therefore hopes that Sir P. Cox may be able to obtain the restoration of the words. Those which Bin Saud proposes to substitute are apparently intended to provide for the constitutiooal election of a successor in a case where the ruler has failed to designate during his lifetime. There seems to be no objection to such a provision, so long as the method of election is practicable, but it does not appear how in such a case His Majesty’s Government are to ensure that only a person agreeable to themselves shall be elected. Since, however, a person elected by a tribal majority would probably have no difficulty in maintaining himself as de facto ruler, if the election had been conducted by a method recognised by the tribes themselves to be valid, undesirable complications are perhaps unlikely to arise.” The draft was concurred in by the Foreign Office, and the following telegram was accordingly despatched by the India Office to the Viceroy on the 16th August, 1915 (111069/15 and 116544/15):— “ Article 1 of treaty. Cox, after suitable explanation, should press for resto ration of original words, to which His Majesty’s Government attach great importance. There seems no objection to election* in default of designation, pro vided method of election is practicable and recognised as valid according to Arab custom by all tribes concerned. Otherwise we may become involved in inter-tribal disputes. “ Article 2. ‘ Unprovoked ’ should be restored. His Majesty’s Government do not like leaving ambiguity as to their aid, and if Bin Saud will not agree to original words they would prefer ‘ to such extent and in such manner as British Government after consultation with Bin Saud may consider most effective for protecting his interests.’ “ Article 4. Cox should secure omission of Bin Baud’s addition if possible; if not, substitution of his own proposal. “ As regards other alterations he should exercise his discretion.” On the 18th August, 1915, the Government of India communicated the telegraphic correspondence that had passed between the Viceroy and the India Office to Sir P. Cox, and authorised him (141285/15) to arrange a meeting with Bin Saud, as he might think advisable, and negotiate further on these lines, on the understanding that a treaty, if concluded, would be subject to ratification by the Government of India. Accordingly, Sir P. Cox resumed negotiations, and concluded a definite treaty with Bin Saud, on the 26th December, 1915 (201630/15). In a letter dated the 3 rd January, 1916 (38086/4650/16), he forwarded to the Government of India a translation of the treaty as signed, and also set out the text of this and of the original British draft (both in translation) in parallel columns, with the alterations marked, and with comments on each alteration, explaining how it arose and * For the words in the British draft of *article 1 which the Viceroy quoted in his telegram of the 7th July, 1915, Bin Saud had substituted “ by the living ruler or by calling for the votes of the subjects inhabiting those countries.”* 12 i j i a nmw of the text signed on this occasion, and subsequently ™hat its effect would be nt memorandum, and the passages that differ ratified, is printed at the e 1 v \ are there done into italics, from the original draft (printed on pp. comme nts, were transmitted by letter to Copies of this text, and of Sn ® L ^ th Feb ruary, 1916, the Viceroy^ the India Office on 21 ^i^ U /2 r 6 y o95/l6) that the Government of India proposed to telegraphed to the India ^ sa ^ n0 objection. ratify the treaty in this foim t k Qfg ce with the concurrence of the This proposal was approved by the bi .

In article 1 we recognise Bin Saud as independent ruler of certain enumerated countries “ and their dependencies and territories, which will be discussed and deter mined hereafter.” This is less explicit than our undertaking to the Idrisi (article 6 of Idrisi Treaty, for which see Memorandum on British Commitments to the Idrisi), in which we under take “ at the conclusion of the war to adjudicate between the rival claims of the Idrisi Saiyid and the Imam Yahya, or any other rival.” But in effect it commits us to arbitrate on the territorial questions at issue between Bin Saud and King Husein, and in the last resort to impose an effective sanction for our award. (2 .)—Keeping of the Peace. In the original trucial treaties with the Independent Chiefs of “ Trucial Oman, His Majesty’s Government’s rights and obligations were strictly limited to the main tenance of peace at sea, and we did not attempt to control the mutual relations on land of the Arab parties to this series of treaties. This formula set a very desirable limit to His Majesty’s Government’s liabilities, while covering most of the causes of strife between the local Arab rulers. The trucial chiefs of Oman hold sway in a narrow strip of territory between the sea and an uninhabited desert. The activities of their subjects are almost wholly maritime, and there are no nomadic tribes in their area of jurisdiction to create difficulties of allegiance and demarcation. # i r • But it is evident that if the British trucial system, hitherto confined to the fringe between the south and east coasts and the great south-eastern desert, is to be extended, as it has been extended during the war, to the remainder of the Peninsula, we shall have to keep the peace between rulers whose prosperity depends, not upon the coasting trade or the pearl fisheries, but upon the command of inland oases and Bedouin tribes. Bin Saud, the Idrisi, and King Husein, with whom we have entered^ into relations during the war, are rulers of this latter kind. A “ Pax Britannica in the Persian Gulf and the Bed Sea, valuable and indeed indispensable as it is, will do comparatively little to remove the causes of friction between them, or to enable His Majesty s Government to deal effectively r with such friction when it arises. If we are to keep the peace between them, we shall be driven eventually to control their relations with one another by land. To a certain extent this may be done by a maritime blockade. But apart from the fact that, where political authority is as lax as it is in Arabia, it is difficult to blockade one State effectively without blockading t e whole Peninsula,* it is in the nature of things more difficult to bring pressure to bear on Hail or Er-Biadh by this method than on Sharjah, or even Maskat Besides this, our new Arab Allies are considerably more powerful than most of the Arab rulers w o have previously entered into a trucial relationship with us. And in the case or mg Husein, who is likely to be the most troublesome of all over his relations wit ns neighbours, it is peculiarly difficult for His Majesty’s Government to exert pressure, whether by blockade or otherwise, owing to the sanctity of his territory m the ®y es ^ the Moslem world, and the traffic of pilgrims between his ports and every other Moslem COim The keeping of the peace on land thus appears to be the crucial problem in that extension of the British trucial system over the remainder of the Arabian Pemnsu a, which has been carried a long way towards completion during the war. . The Treaty with Bin Saud is our first experiment in this more highly-developed and difficult form of trucial relationship, and in their ruling on the Treaty a short I 1 ^ 116 after its ratification (see above), the India Office laid down the important^ doctrine t at “ we cannot admit that Article 2 is binding on us as against other Arabs. On this ruling, our obligations to Bin Saud by land would be confined to securing him against aggression on the part of some outside Power {e.g., Turkey, I ersia^ [939] This seems a fair induction from our experiences during the war at Koweit. E14 Germany, Russia, France). But it may perhaps be doubted whether our admitted obligations, unde; Article 1, regarding the demarcation of his territories would not commit us to active intervention against any other Arab ruler, such as King usem, who might resort to force to reverse our award. , . , , ,, . , It would appear desirable that, on this question, which affects all our new Ara£ relationships, a clear line of policy should be determined upon. (3.) Dynastic Guarantee. n T t- tvt • x &gt; In concluding a trucial treaty with an Arab ruler, it has not been His Majesty s Government’s custom to recognise it as binding them to his descendants. But it m evident that it would have been difficult to avoid doing so ultimately in cases m which our relationship had lasted over a long period, or m which the dynasty was firmly established and poss^ssed^prestige^^ ^ ^ Article 2 of the present Treaty merely follows a precedent already set in the case of the Sheikh of Mohammerah (see Memorandum on British Commitments to the Gulf Chiefs), and it is hedged roun wit reSe This would not appear to be so crucial a question as that of keeping the peace on land, but the history of our relations with the Sheikhs of Bahrein and Katar shows that a dynastic guarantee might prove awkward in certain cases, and that the precedent should not too readily be made into a general rule. {* YAPPENDIX. TEXT OF THE TREATY OF DECEMBER 26, 1915. In the Name of God the Merciful and Compassionate. Preamble,. The High British Government on its own part, and Abdul Aziz-bin-Abdur Rahman-bin-Faisal Al-Saud, Ruler of Najd, El Hassa, Qatif and Jubail, and the towns and ports belonging to them, on behalf of himself, his heirs and successors, and tribesmen, being desirous of confirming and strengthening the friendly relations which have for a long time existed between the two parties, and with a view to consolidating their respective interests—the British Government have named and appointed Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Cox, K.C.S.I., K.C.I.E., British Resident in the Persian Gulf, as their Plenipotentiary, to conclude a treaty for this purpose with Abdul Aziz-bin-Abdur Rahman-bin-Faisal Al-Saud. The said Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Cox and Abdul Aziz-bin-Abdur Rahman-bin-Faisal Al-Saud (hereafter known as “ Bin Saud ”), have agreed upon and concluded the following articles :— I.’ The British Government do acknowledge and admit that Najd, El Hassa, Qatif and Jubail, and their dependencies and territories, which will be discussed and determined hereafter, and their ports on the shores of the Persian Gulf are the countries of Bin Saud and of his fathers before him, and do hereby recognise the said Bin Saud as the independent Ruler thereof and absolute Chief of their tribes, and after him his sons and descendants by inheritance; but the selection of the individual shall be in accordance with the nomination (i.e., by the living Ruler) of his successor; but with the proviso that he shall not be a person antagonistic to the British G-overnment in any respect; such as, for example, in regard to the terms mentioned in this treaty. II. In the event of [“ unprovoked ” omitted] aggression by any foreign Power on the territories of the countries of the said Bin Saud and his descendants without reference to the British Government and ivithout giving her an opportunity of communicating with Bin Saud and composing the matter, the British Government will aid Bin Saud to such extent and in such a manner as the British Govern ment after consulting Bin Saud may consider most effective for protecting his interests a/nd countries. III. Bin Saud hereby agrees and promises to refrain from entering into any correspondence, agreement, or treaty with any foreign nation or Power, and, further, to give immediate notice to the political authorities of the British Government of any attempt on the part of any other Power to interfere with the above territories. IY. Bin Saud hereby undertakes that he will absolutely not cede, sell, mortgage, lease, or otherwise dispose of the above territories or any part of them, or grant concessions within those territories to any foreign Power or to the subjects of any foreign Power,* without the consent of the British Government. And that he will follow her advice unreservedly provided that it be not damaging to his own interests. Y. Bin Saud hereby undertakes to keep open within his territories the roads leading to the Holy Places, and to protect pilgrims on their passage to and from the Holy Places. * The words “ or the subjects of any foreign Power ” were accidentally omitted in the copies signed by Sir P. Cox and Bin Saud on the 26th December, 1915. Sir P. Cox drew Bin Saud^ attention to this omission in a letter dated the 27th December, 1915 (38086/16), and added : “ I have duly written them in the text of the original document which I am submitting to Government, and Government will consider it in this form ; so that if the same mistake occurs in the copy with you, I trust you will add the words above quoted.”16 VI.

From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Baghdad, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla (repeated Secretary of State for India and British High Commissioner, Egypt, Cairo). Philby reports as follows under date, Riyadh, July 19th, telegraphed from Koweit, August 3rd :— Begins, In view of recent events venture to refer review of situation during last 3 months for consideration. On rejoining Ibn Saud last April with Government decision for com munication found him greatly disappointed with outcome of negotiations undertaken on our initiative and firmly convinced that result was due to machinations of Sheriff. My instructions* were to press him to maintain effective control over *« - ixr mop *T 7 Tr Qasim and stop smuggling and exercise * Serial No. 102, Part VII. , cn x i real pressure on Shammar. I was also authorised to hold out certain attractive inducements in event of capture of Hail and assure him of final favourable settlement of Ajman question. I also assured him our engagements with Sheriff involved nothing prejudicial to his interests and absolute independence in accordance with former agreement. He was pleased with last two items but said his blockade must depend largely on effective measures at Koweit. I reassured him on this point. Finally he declared that owing to cost of keeping his army in field and absence of ready money he could not undertake operations against Shammar. This I regarded as sine qua non conditional on continuance with our work and was thus faced with alternative of abandoning work or devising other measures. In former case my conviction, fully justified by events, was that trouble would occur with Sheriff if Ibn Saud left to himself in a If CJUAT-S'' igdiscontented frame of mind. Therefore chose latter alternative and takimj advantage of his financial situation offered him loan of dollars lying idle at TJauair n on condition of action against Shammar. He accepted offer and Offensive was arranged to open beginning of Bamdhan. Meanwhile prepara- tions went ahead with every reasonable hope of success if nothing untowaid philby then records series of untoward events including koweit blockade, attack on Khorma by Sheriff, tribal difficulties arising out of conflicting interests of authorities in Koweit, Mesopotamia and Inn San . lignins. Above events following each other in rapid succession are making my position here increasingly difficult and unenvmble. Ibn Saud is beginmno’ to show signs of restlessness and dissatisfaction suspecting either the ImSfides of our policy or tlie force of my advocacy and representation. General pubto feeling always hostile and sceptical of our intentions is beginning to seriously challenge wisdom of Ibn Sand’s alliance and policy and oplnly demands vigorous reply to action of Sheriff and Apnan. Ibn Sand fully realises that break with us would be disastrous to his future but is in verv difficult position. He cannot indefinitely allow me to keep his bands tied while his enemies enjoying our protection are actually attacking nu both sides and what I fear most of all is that public opinion will prove too strong for him to resist. As it is, confident in our will and power to restrain Sheriff he has pledged himself to go to assistance of people ot Khurma if again attacked and he will do the same with Ajman if we insist. Meanwhile all these complications are seriously delaying operations against Sharomar who take but fourth place in list of enemies to Sheriff, Ajman and Koweit. I have given assurances that above matters will engage tavourable attention of Government and nothing but tangible result from such assurances will restore our prestige in Central Arabia which has suffered serious diminution through recent events. I have made specific recommendations in all cases and trust they will have urgent consideration. It is for Government to decide relative importance of placating Ibn Saud by abiding by its undertakings or his enemies by permitting them to transgress, hut it is my duty to utter warning that whatever scepticism may prevail in high quarters regarding Ibn Sand’s military power and ability to harm onr vital interests no doubts at all should he allowed regarding the will to war inspiring his subjects. We have now unparalled opportunity of establishing a commanding influ ence and both now and hereafter in Central Arabia by a little firmness in repressing the aggressive tendencies of onr allies and proteges and Ibn Saud who has stood faithfully by his engagements in spite of promptings from within and aggression from without will not he blameworthy if the situation gets out of hand. Trust matters may receive serious and sympathetic consideration and request that in future, if no objection, I may be consulted before action taken in matters affecting Jfajd. Ends. As regards last sentence it will he realised that as every reference to Philby involves at least a month’s delay, it is seldom practicable to consult him on urgent questions that arise daily. More follows. 42 Telegram R., No. 6490, dated the 7th (received 9th) August 1918. From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Baghdad, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla (repeated to His Majesty's Secretary of State for India and High Commissioner, Egypt). On July 9th I communicated to Philby for his information as a matter of routine the purport of recent reports regarding activities of Ibn Rashid, Philby replies under date July 24th by telegraph from Koweit as follows:— Begins. Though not explicitly indicated understand that these telegrams arcdesigned to rouse Ibn Saud to activity to prevent realisation of any plans by pressure here. Accordingly communicated news as desired and suggested that it was time to get a move on. This morning he sprung on me long written documents in which he reviews trend of recent events and adopts attitude that his undertaking to act in our interests against Ibn Rashid, &amp;c., was made on understanding we would protect his interests vis-h-vis Sheriif, Ajman, Koweit, &amp;c. But recent events have materially altered situation and not being properly protected by us against enemies besetting him atlTound he cannot with due regard to his own interests launch out against Ibn Rashid or accept responsibility for leakage of supplies to enemy unless we give him definite guarantees. I attach much importance to fact that he has put his grievances into writing in reply to my summons to action. On my pointing out that he had not yet carried out his part of the bargain for loan received he replied that he w 7 as prepared to refund loan rather than risk disaster by leaving his flanks unprotected from Sheriff and Ajman. He demands following explicit guarantees as preliminaries for any further action on his part or acceptance of responsibility for blockade, namely :— (0 British Government to guarantee absolutely immunity of his territory and people from any kind of interference or attack by Sheriff. This of course comprises the Khurma and Ataiba disputed border land pending settlement. (2) Guarantee be given that Ajraan and Sbammar elements under our protection should on no account enter his territory for any purpose whatever without his consent. Those not under our protection on no account to be allowed to enter our territory or Koweit. Musabilla to be given to friendly elements only on monthly ration system on basis of actual members present to prevent leakage to unfriendly elements. (8) As long as blockade of Koweit remains in hands of Ibn Sub;ih declines all responsibility of leakage to enemy and suggests either that blockade be resumed by British or all goods for Najd be landed at Bahrein or Hasa ports. In either ease he accepts full icsponsibility and (4) That above guarantees being given on our part and hostilities against Ibn Rashid begun on bis, ^e will not let him down by withholding sinews of war as necessary. Having carefully considered this document came to follow ing conclusions;— (1) Further incursions of Sheriff or Ajman will certainly lead to disturb ance and must be stopped at all costs. (2) IVlaintenance of effective blockade is entirely in our own interests and methods suggested are only possible alternatives. ( %) Above all urgently necessary to involve Ibn Saud in hostilities with Ibn Rashid without delay partly to keep his mind from preying on other grievances and chiefly to obviate all possibility of his combining with Ibn Rashid to attack Sheriff. Latter contingency by no means impossible if we leave him in the lurch by refusing redress for grievances and would be ex tremely popular movement amongst the people. In the circumstances and in view of unmistakable evidence of increasing estrangement of Ibn Saud and urgency of obliterating unfavourable impres sion caused by recent events have taken responsibility of giving written under takings in following terms, namely ;— (i) We guarantee him immunity from further attack by Sheriff or Ajman and Shammar elements under our protection and to refuse protection and Musabilla to hostile elements. (ii) Removal and rectification of blockade arrangements in some manner acceptable to him or if unable to do so will not hold him responsible for leakage of supplies. (in) Wfe will see that his material resources do not suffer by reason of any hostilities undertaken by him on our behalf. But I have explicitly stated that above undertaking is conditional on his70 fulfilling his promise to undertake hostilities at once and on his setting out from Riyadh within 10 days from to-day. This ou his part he undertakes to do. I have added that if Government unwilling or unable to endorse my euarantees or act on them shall not expect him to fulfil his part of the baro-ain. Matter now is at critical stage and everything depends on Govern- ment’s decision to this and previous telegrams. Trust my guarantees will he favourably considered and formally endorsed without delay. Also that screw may be put upon Dhari and Ajman. ‘ As regards money in view of Turks’ generous treatment of Ibn Rashid and possibility of increased activity by him, request question of placing liberal funds at my disposal be considered if really vigorous campaign be desired. We are making more detailed proposals in this respect. As you already have my considered opinions. Ends. My comment follows. ~43 Telegram P^No. 6491, dated the 7th (received 9tb) August 1918. From—His Britannic Majesty's Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Baghdad, ip 0 rphe Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla (repeated to the Secretary of State for India and the British High Commissioner, Egypt, Cairo). Cox being in Cairo, London and Simla, I have felt it unnecessary for me hitherto, to submit views on current questions regarding Central Arabia. Cox, however, has other pre-occupations and is now on water. Following recom mendations on Bin Baud’s demands and Philby’s action thereon are therefore deferentially submitted. (1) Bin Sand to be informed in writing that a special commission to * Secret— Wa,. June 1917 , Nob. bo-145, Pro. No. determine boundaries of territory as 143. referred to in Article 1 of Treaty* or 26th December 1915 and to conclude further Agreement referred to in Article 7, will be sent by His Majesty’s Governmeat as soon as conditions admit and that Article 2 of Treaty applies equally to aggression by King Hussain. He must meanwhile abstain from pressing his claims at Khurma and should do his best to check Akhwan agents and anarchic activity. (2) and (3) confirm Philby’s undertakings. The only channel into which Bin Baud’s interests and aspirations can now be diverted which will not bring him into conflict with King Hussain appears to be operations against Ibn Rashid. Little result is anticipated by me from these operations which if successful would probably prove embarrassing to King Hussain but for reasons above given X recommend authority be given me to place at Philhy’s disposal liberal funds together with a further supply of 1,000 rifles and 150 thousand rounds of ammunition for prosecution of campaign against Ibn Rashid.

From—His Britannic Majesty’s Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Baghdad, To The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla (repeated to the Secretary of State for India and the British High Commissioner, Egypt). Under date July 18th Philby reports:—Under protection of Awazim mixed gang of about 100 Ajman and Aslam Shammar attacked Subai tribe adherents of Ibn Baud between Quif § Qatif m (?). and^ Hasa but were routed. Raid ori- ignated in Koweit territory and they previously had successfully attackeda caravan belonging to Ibn Sand. In Philby’s opinion Sheikh of Koweit is responsible for occurrence and was fully cognisant of movements of gang. He states that this and other recent events are making things extremely difficult for Ibn Saud and himself and are causing widespread resentment in Najd and have given rise to complaints by Ibn Saud that we are not giving him our support. Serious consequences will, he thinks, ensue if such raids are allowed to take place. He proposes that Salim should be warned that the next occur rence of raiding by Ajman or Shammar vid Koweit territory will result in his deposition or other serious action and Salim should be called on to punish chief of Awazim. Political Agent comments on this that the only satisfactory means of stopping raids is strong action by ourselves. He suggests location of mobile column of our troops at Koweit. I am unable to recommend either course. The raid complained of so far as it could have been prevented by Sheikh of Koweit is outcome of unsatisfactory relations existing between the two. The recent deterioration of these relations is due primarily to decision not to send troops to Koweit to enforce blockade but to place the onus of . iXrTT enforcing on Sheikh (mte my telegram* * Serial No. 137, Part VII. p tit V, , J ^ t i 3977 of May 7th). Subsequent trouble would in all probability have been averted had troops been sent when first t Seri.. No. u, p*rt vii. P ro PT* ^ e ? eral Officer Commanding, T Baghdad, telegram,f 5777, December 6th) two platoons would have sufficed. In present circumstances I recommend that no less than a squadron of cavalry and half a battalion be despatched to Koweit forthwith. This, I think, may tend to stabilise situation there and indirectly in Central Arabia. General Officer Commanding-in-Chief has seen foregoing and desires me to say that he has no comment to make thereon, assuming he is not called on to provide the troops required. 45 Tel«gwun R., No. 6514, dated the 8th (received 9th) August 1918.

Do not understand on what grounds it is stated am quite out of touch. I left him with strictest orders to remain at Hafar blocking trade route from Koweit via Bahn to Hail and paid him three months’ allowance in advance to enable him buy supplies from Koweit to keep his tribes there. At same time Ibn Saud and I arranged with him to harry Abda and to write letter shewing progress each month on understanding that he would receive no further pay ments until he could shew some solid achievement. A month later he writes from Safwan giving specious account of arrangements made for guarding Hafar route but not explaining his disobedience of my orders while he adds that he had been approached with offers of friendship by Ihn Rimal of Sinjara and had written accepting the offer on condition of his coming in to reside with him. He omits, however, to mention that he had signed a pass for about 500 camel loads of goods as earnest of future friendship and that the caravan passed through his blockade line unhindered to Hail. Unfortunately for him Ibn Rimal has sent in a messenger to Ibn Saud who saw the caravan arrive just before he left. In above circumstances Dhari has a good deal to answer for, and I think— (1) that on arrival at Safwan without any indication of my approval he should have been ordered back to his post; (2) that he should not have been admitted to Musabila with Zubair without authorisation from me; (3) that when fact of Zubair Musabila became known he should have been allowed no more supplies from Koweit pending reference to me as there was obviously something wrong; and (4) that his transfer to Zubair jurisdiction on a proposal made with out knowledge of the facts and without consulting me amounted to playing straight into his hand and was unfortunate. It would be interesting to know if he has succeeded in getting any further instalments of his allowance at Basrah. If so, it could only be by. misrepresentation as he has been fully paid up to end of July. For above reasons trust decision will be reconsidered. If so, request that Dhari be directed to visit me at Riyadh personally as soon as possible without explaining reasons and that he he told to send his tribesmen to Hafar without delay. Meantime no further provisions should he supplied to him from Koweit or Zubair except on my signed pass in every case and no instalment of allowance should be paid. When he arrives here he will find it a little diffi cult to explain matters. If transfer absurd to presume specific offence above reported will be dealt with suitably. Meanwhile Hafar remains open door for blockade runners and I trust steps will he taken to close it. Addressed Baghdad ; repeated Basrah. Ends. No information regarding Dhari’s aims has been received here. Y ipirt* Copy of Memorandum from the Deputy Civil Commissioner, Basrah, to the Civil Com missioner, Baghdad, No. 10228, dated the 8th July 1918. Reference Pbilhy’s telegram* No. M.-80, dated June 25th, which was • Page 70 , ante. forwarded under No. 953,t dated 7th July t ibid. 1918 , from the Political Agent at Koweit. Up to November last Dhari Ihn Tawala and his tribe were always under the’political control of the Assistant Political Officer, Zuhair. This is indeed theinatural arrangement, seeing that Zubair is the source of their supplies and the centre round which they revolve. In November 1917, for a special74 purpose, this arrangement was altered. The proposal made from here accepted by the Civil Commissioner was as follows . «mari is obviously anxious to take on fallen mantle of Sand with i affaohpd thereto and in his present mood he might he very useful ** X cTrkeep ht tnbesren together hut he is clearly no use to Mission if he h . i. o f /i 7nVinir We accordingly think that his services should =^^hi^^ou,d be paid by me and that ^ down so as to reach some spot between Hafar and Buraida by the time I arrive latter place. He would then be ma position to render aC ‘ l 7. His aUowance should be fixed at rupees three thousand and he should reoeire t e ammunition twenty-five boxes recently rescued from Saud and the latter’s 3 rifles when handed in. Dhan accepts these conditmns and assures me of his eagerness to do as bidden and we think that above is best solution. I have accordingly paid him his enhanced allowance in. advance forthis month and arranged for ammunition o he (( given to him and he undertakes to he at the rendezvous in one month s time. Having made this arrangement Mr. Philby set off into the unknown and we heard no more of him. Neither apparently did Dhan for towards the end cf March he wrote to me as follows:— I he (r to ii form vour honour that four months ago I left Safwan as Gov ernment wanted me to go to Buraidah. In obedience to tile Government orders 1 came to Qasim side. The British Government promised me increase of pay and informed me that mv pay and provisions were transferred to Buraidah and ?har Mr. Philbv, Assistant Political Officer, Buraidah, would give me necessary f rders I wrote many letters to Buraidah and also sent some letters with my men to Mr. Hamilton at Riyadh but I have not found any Political Officer at Qasim I am perplexed as I do not know what orders Government have about me. Now I have come this place as ordered by the High Government for whom I have been loyal and this is known. « j t,i, a t my pay and provisions may he sent to me as promised and orders mav also be conveyed to me. I sent letters to the British Consul, Koweit and Mr. MacCollum, Assistant Political Officer, Zuhair, but no reply has been received. Kindly sent reply with the messenger of this letter. ” About the same time Mr. Philby reappeared in Basrah. He made no complaint whatever as to the way in which Dhari had discharged the duties entrusted to him. On the contrary Mr. Philby paid Dhari Rs. 15,000, the amount due to him at the enhanced rate arranged by Mr. Philby in the preceding November and returned through his camp to Buraidah via the Batin and Hafar. Mr. Philhy never gave any information to this office, or to the Political Agent at Koweit of the further payments made by him to Dhari or told us what it was that he now required Dhari to do. Whatever it was, by Mr. Philby’s own showing, Dhari did not do it, but, being now put in posses sion of ample funds by Mr. Philby’s payments, amounting to Rs. 24,000 in all, started trading with the enemy, Mr. Philby meanwhile had once more passed from our ken and was said to be travelling in Harij and towards the Dawasir valley. The mere mention of these names is enough to show how idle is any talk of Dhari and the Aslam being retained under his control, seeing that the latter were encamped within a day or two of Koweit and Zubair, but were not within a month’s journey of Mr. Philby. It may also be mentioned once more that no intimation, whatever, was given by Mr. Philby either to this office or to Koweit as to Dhari’s short-comings. In fact, up to the 20th April Mr. Philby does not seem to have been aware of them. Por on that date he wrote to Koweit asking that persons bearing written authority from Dhari Ihn Tawala should be given food-stuffs to reasonable amounts. This letter was not presented before the Political Agent at Koweit until near the end of May. The incident is in itself sufficient proof of the impracticability of leaving a parcel of scamps, like Dhari and his Aslam, under the nominal control of an officer who resides in the remoter recesses of a large continent, and gives no indication thence of his views or wishes with regard to those whose actions he is supposed to be watching.I may add that since Dhari came back to these parts from Hafar two instalments of his allowance have been paid to him, and the rate at which that allowance is payable has been reduced to the figure at which it stood before Mr. Philby took control of his affairs. I am in communication with the Assistant Political Officer, Zubair, as to the charges against Dhari now made by Mr. Philby. He will enquire into them and submit his report. Meanwhile it does not seem to be of much consequence whether Hafar remains an open door or the scene of Dhari’s conveyancing activities.

Obviously Dhari did not like prospect of actual conflict with Shammar so retired to safe distance with result Turki moving on Ajibba wells found Abdah had got wind and decamped. If Dhari had been at Hafar and played up retiring enemy would have been caught between the two. As it was, they escaped to Bashuk and Hidaqa wells south line with Turki in pursuit.

From— The Political Agent, Koweit, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Baghdad. Following from Philby Riyadh, M.-110, July 18th :— Begins. Reference correspondence ending with Koweit telegramj 97-G. of July 7th. Firstly, understand — One. —That all blockade arrangements including issue of passes are cancelled. 7’wo.—That Najd caravans can buy what they like and take it away without let or hinderance. Three —That Salim is to be given another run and be trusted to see that goods do not get into wrong hands. And four. —That imports are to be regulated on basis of reasonable requirements of Koweit tow T n and tribes plus actual export to Najd as reported from time to time by Abdullah Nafisi. Secondly, certain obvious criticisms of new scheme have doubtless been considered but remedy not stated, namely— One .—If Najdis may purchase without pass, permission or question how is Abdulla Nafisi to ascertain what they purchase for export or how prevent undesirable Najdi individuals purchasing to smuggle to enemy. Without blockade staff he cannot he expected to do either. If passes abolished how can I bn Saud check arrivals this end. Personally can seen no remedy short of entertainment of private blockade staff by Abdulla Nafisi or subjection of Najd exporters to inquisition by Sheikh’s blockade officials. Former alternative obviously impracticable and would be more offensive to Sheikh than British blockade. Latter would produce endless friction between Sheikh and Ibn Saud in view of present strained relations due to breakdown of Ajman arrangements. Thirdly, absolutely no guarantee of Sheikh’s good faith and no means of satisfying ourselves how he acquits himself of his duties. Previous record makes it extremely unlikely he will keep out Sham mar and Ajman smugglers. Indeed when last post left Koweit following caravans from Hail were actually in Koweit, namely, (one) Saad A1 Hizzani and Azaima with 70 camels and (two) Abdul Aziz ibn Humaiyim and Abu Adal with unknown number. We thus revert to original unsatisfactory situation of two years back which gave rise to all this trouble. Fourthly, deplore invidious task criticising accomplished fact but Ibn Saud extremely sore about new development. From the beginning he has always taken line that he cannot blockade his territory without losing hold over Qasim elements unless serious effort made to blockade Koweit itself. After much discussion and the fiasco of last April scheme of blockade was evolved which was not only effective as evidenced by large crop of Shammar advances but gave universal satisfaction in Najd. Ibn Saud threw himself with zest into task of ensurin? effective measures here and had evolved simple and stringent scheme which promised complete success when suddenly without consultation all arrangements cancelled. In circumstances Ibn Saud asks me inform Government that he cannot accept any responsibility for leakage of o-oods to enemy so long as Koweit remains open to all comers. He also points out that such leakage will prejudice his plans for action against Shammar and Ibn Rashid. Fifthly, am not in position appreciate relative merits efficient blockade and maintenance friendly relations with Sheikh at expense thereof but possible effect of new measures on Najd blockade has not been considered. On this point, I have no illusions. Undesirable Najdis will be the first to reopen trade with enemy. Difficult suggest remedy but offer following suggestion for consideration, namely— One, Leave Koweit arrangement unaltered so far as concerns reasonable requirements of town and tribes.87 rf w0 porbid access to Koweit markets by all Najdis traders or Badawin. m, ree —Notify India that in future Bahrain, Qa,tif or Uqair will be Najd trade inlets and request them to notify public accordingly and allow ships to discharge Najd cargoes there either on outward or return journey without limit of quantities. , . , ,, - Four .—Ibn Sand will see that cargoes are not re-exported by dhow from Ofttif and Uaair while at Bahrain. Dhows should obtain clearance certificate stow ng destSion and cargo. Those coming to Hasa porte will be examined by Ibn Saud’s Collector of Customs. Have discussed possible solut.ou on these lines with Ibn Sand who approves proposal and is ready to notify Najdis and Abdulla Nafis that no Najdiis to go to Koweit for any putpose without a permission and to accept full responsibility as before tor effective blockade of all stuff landed at ports mentioned. Bahrain merchants if notified would soon indicate their requirements to Indian agents and it would be essential to ensure sailing of reasonable number of ships say on basis of previous sailings to Koweit. Result would he automatically stop inland export trade from Koweit as all buyers would he clearly buying for enemy. As only alternative is acquiescence in all round breakdown of blockade and leakage to enemy trust proposals will receive urgent favourable consider- ation to relieve tension here. Finally Koweit advices to Ibn Saud indicate heavy bear sales of British futures owing to our climbdown which is attributed to serious war situation evidenced by defeat in France and cessation of news from Palestine. Please keep me informed of all Arab and Palestine activities. Ibnds, Enclosure No. 4 to Serial No. 66. Telegram, Fo. 1153, dated the 2nd (received 3rd) August 1918 (Confidential). Prom—The Political Agent, Koweit, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Baghdad. Following from Philby, Biyadh, M.-ll 1, July 19th In view recent events, venture submit review of situation during last three months for consideration. firstly. On rejoining Ibn Saud last April with Government decision for communication found him greatly disappointed with outcome of negotiations undertaken on Our initiative and firmly convinced result due to machinations of Sheriff. My instructions were to press him maintain effective control Qasim and stop smuggling and exercise real pressure on Shammar. I was also authorised to hold out certain attractive inducements in event capture Hail and assure him of final favourable settlement Ajman question. I also assured him that our engagements with Sheriff involved nothing prejudicable to his interests and absolute independence in accordance former agreement. He was pleased with last two items but said his blockade must depend largely on effective measures by us at Koweit. I reassured him on this point. Finally he declared that owing cost of keeping his army in field and absence of ready money he could not undertake operations against Shammar. This I regarded as sine qua non conditions of continuance mission’s work and was thus faced with alternative of abandoning work or devising other measures. In former case my conviction^ since fully justified by events was that trouble would occur with Sheriff if Ibn Saud left to himself in discontented frame of mind. Therefore chose latter alternative and taking advantage of his financial situation offered him loan of dollars lying idle at Uqair on condition of action against Shammar. He accepted offer and offensive was arranged open beginning Bamdhan. Meanwhile preparations went ahead with every reason hope success if nothing untoward occurred Secondly. Becord of events since then as follows :— One. —Koweit blockade incident of April causing widespread excitement and resentment throughout Najd but fortunately rectified without delay byi hrce. —Second attack on Khurma with similar results. Four. Migration of Dhari from Hafar to Safwan in suite of )&gt;;&lt;= cote™ s„r b “ ■ .k,” “,r.t s£-;f to ““ :k,ss£ ar “»“ •• *•“ ws» ss —Granting o f pa S s on Dhari’s recommendation to 500 camels of Ibn Bimal whose arrival loaded with goods at Hail duly reported. Acceptance at Baghdad of advances of Majid ibn Aiil after his refusal of reasonable terms of Ibn Saud reported by me at time. Seren.-Grant of Asylum to Ajraan without adequate or effective guarantees for good behaviour of whole tribe and failure to expel them fullv irom Koweit territory. 1 Fight. Recrudescence of Ajman hostile activities culminating in raid and capture of klutair camels near Artawiya. Raid and capture of 500 camels from Ibn Baud’s caravan close to Koweit. And finally last unsucces- ful raid on Subai between Qatif and Hasa under protection of Awazim. And »me -Our complete volteface in matter of Koweit blockade certain to result in leakage to enemy and renewed friction between Ibn Saud and OilGlKu. To summarise above :— One was satisfactorily disposed of but is nullified by nine. Two, three seven and eight are the old original burning questions over again. * While four, five, six and nine “ stymy ” mission’s main objects. Thirdly. Above events following each other in rapid succession are making my position here increasingly difficult and unenviable. Ibn Saud is beginning shew signs of restlessness and dissatisfaction suspecting either the bond fides of our policy or the force of my advocacy and representations. General public feeling always hostile and sceptical of our intentions is beginning seriously to challenge wisdom of Ibn Saud’s alliance and policv and openly demands vigorous reply to action of Sheriff and Ajman. Ibn Saud fully realises that break with us would be disastrous to his future but is in very difficult position. He cannot indefinitely allow me to keep his hands tied while bis enemies enjoying our protection are actually attacking him both sides and \Hiat I fear most of all is that public opinion will prove too strong for him to resist. As it is confident in our will and power to restrain Sheriff he has pledged himself to go to assistance people Khurma if again attacked and he will do same with Ajman if we take no action. Meanwhile all these complications are seriously delaying operations against Shammar who take but fourth place in list of enemies to Sheriff, Ajman and Koweit. Fourthly. I have given assurances that above matters will engage favourable attention of Government and nothing but tangible result from such assurances will restore our prestige in Central Arabia which has suffered serious diminution through recent events. I have made specific recommenda tions in all cases and trust they will have urgent consideration. It is for Government to decide relative importance of placating Ibn Saud by abiding by its undertakings or his enemies by permitting them to transgress but it is my duty to utter warning that whatever scepticism may prevail in high quarters regarding Ibn Saud’s military power and ability to harm our vital interests no doubts at all should be allowed regarding the will to war inspiring his subjects. We have now unparalleled opportunity of establishing commanding influence and prestige both now and hereafter in Central Arabia by a little firmness in repressing the aggressive tendencies of our allies and protdges and Ibn Saud89 withi^an^aggresdon^fro^wUbout ^U 1 blameworthy i£ the situation gets out of hand. . , svmpa tlietic consideration and in matters affecting interests of Na]d.

In these circumstances and in view of unmistakable evidences of increas ing estrangement of Ibn Sand and urgency of obliterating unfavourable impression caused by recent events, have taken responsibility of giving written undertaking in following terms, namely —W e guarantee him immunity from further attack by Sheriff or Ajman and Shammar elements under our protection and to refuse protection and musabilla to hostile elements.

And three .—We will see that his material resources do not suffer by reason of any hostilities undertaken by him on our behalf. But I have explicitly stated that above undertaking is conditional ^ on his fulfilling his promise to undertake hostilities at once and on his setting out from Eijadh within ten days from to-day. This on his part he undertakes £0 do. I have added that if Government unwilling or unable endorse my guarantee or act on them shall not expect him to fulfil his pait of baigain.

Before it is finally decided, we must urge a reconsideration of the question of the offer to Bin Saud of 100 rifles to make good defects of93 1 000 cheap Winchester rifles previously given as effective weapons, as it is calculated rather to offend than to conciliate him. Over Khurma business Bin Saud is sore and already suspicious of our sincerity, since that place is well outside Hedjaz limits as defined in Hand-book of Hedjaz and published by Cairo Arab Bureau, and prior to Arab revolt, had apparently no connection with Sheriff’s jurisdiction. Bin Saud, in such a frame of mind, and to whom news of our successes in the West percolates slowly and with little effect may quite probably throw off allegiance to us and either raise Wahabi standard and embark on campaign of his own against Hedjaz, or make peace with Turks and join Bin Has hid against King Hussain. Apart from our obligation to Bin Saud, our earlier ally among Arab potentates, our endeavour to placate King Hussain to throw Arabia into such internecine strife would surely be a mistake.

Very fact that all arrangements proposed by me in reply have been adopted without question suggests that action might have been deferred till receipt my reply and doubt ful applications held over. Further submit that in circumstances sufficient use was not made of Ibn Baud’s agent, Abdulla Nafisi, whose reports suggest that he was as much perturbed as other Najd elements. Salient facts remain that Najd people were turned out of Koweit in circumstances of military display calculated to create alarm in wild ignorant people such as they are; Secondly —That no information regrading the events of those days reached me until long after I had taken the responsibility of giving assurances to Ibn Saud, though conscious that those assurances might, perhaps for good reasons, be impossible for British Government to accept and; Thirdly —That for a fortnight or more Najd was in a state of ferment and there was much wild talk of attacking Koweit, &amp;c. Finally in view of facts and other indications I am not inclined to acquit Shaikh Salim of a deliberate though covert attempt to create trouble. Accordingly both on merits of case and on political grounds I maintain my opinion that a formal apology should be tendered to Ibn Saud who was caused a great deal of trouble and anxiety I trust my recommendation will be accepted.

Letter ends with hope that he will soon do so. Khurma affair leading to strife between Sheriff and Ibn Sand has doubtless raised Turkish hopes of detaching Ibn Saud. Matter was discussed to-day in ordinary course with Shaikh Abdalla ibn Abdul IV ahhab, the high priest, and latter criticising Ibn Saud’s policy pointed out— (1) That if we are unable to restrain Sheriff and Ajman they are unable to rely on us and Ibn Saud should take steps to save situation before too late, and (2) That if we can, but don’t, restrain them our bad faith is patent. Ibn Saud replied that recent unfortunate events have all occurred during absence Sir Percy Cox and he confidently expected change for better on his return.

Details of Ajman raid referred to in my M.-134 j* • Enclosure No. 7. ^ to han(L gubai on Qatif Hasa border were raided about week ago by considerable force composed of Hadi and Safran sections. Ajman while driving off camels were attacked and routed by Subai who recovered their own and captured 30 camels and 31 rifles and killed 8 of enemy including three Shaikhs, namely, Muhammad Ibn Mutalaqqam of Hadi section and Awaiyid Ibn Hadi and Dhumaid Ibn Juwaia of Safran. Though Ajman have joined but little in all these raids they have succeeded in creating state of general insecurity and the road from Koweit must definitely be considered unsafe for ordinary traffic. Messengers bringing last batch of letters saw tw r o raiders’ gangs and had to manoeuvre for safety. It is clear that the Ajman are badly out of hand and fact that they operate from safe refuge on our border brings discredit on us and very little doubt that Ibn Subhn Dhari and Shaikh, Koweit, view raiders with benevolently neutral eyes. Have persuaded Ibn Saud that his wisest course is to refrain from action until receipt of reply to my representations and I guarantee his inactivity till then but drastic action must be taken with Ajman if we wish to avoid serious disturbance. Alternatives seem— (1) To cut off Musabila and friendly relations with all Ajman and leave Ibn Saud free hand in which case he will certainly attack these, or (2) To demand hostages from every Shaikh’s family under our protection to remain at Basrah as guarantee of good conduct and to ration such sections and leave rest to Ibn Saud’s tender mercies forbidding them to settle with protected Ajman or in Koweit territory.

Ibn Dhuwaibi, chief of Harb, now here, reports that Sheriff Abdulla has sent messenger toIbn Rashid with peace offers on strength of latter’s intercepted letters complaining of Turkish treatment. Ibn Sand does not beleive Ibn Rashid will listen to any overtures, but regards Abdulla’s action as hostile to himself. This is probably correct deduction. In view latest indications am inclined to think reports of likelihood of overtures by Ibn Rashid were baseless in which case may expect him to become actually hostile when his armament arrives.

From—The British High Commissioner, Egypt, Bacos Ramleh, To The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, Simla. The suggestion contained in your telegramf has been carefully considered by me but I am strongly of opinion that t Not received. no useful purpose would be served by meeting and by despatch of British Commission. Issue between Bin Saud and King Hussain as I have previously explained is effect of many years intrigue and counter intrigue between Mecca and Riyadh for ascendancy over tribesmen in intervening territory and is not a question of boundary ownership. The personal jealousy of two principals and sectarian fued of Sunni and Wahabi perversions disagree. According to Philby the collection of religious taxes at Khurma by Ashraf was based on practice instituted by Saud, Emir, ^ who in 1800 led Wahabi invasion of Hedjaz. After retrogression of Wahabi tide, Sheriffial influence, doubtless aided by Turks, spread eastward until 1910 when in a treaty between Bin Saud and Sheriff we find former acknowledging latter’s claim over the whole of the Ateiba tribesmen, an obviously impossible arrangement. Ignorant of local tradition and affairs a British Commission would be involved in sectarian disputes and a maze of tribal politics and would be totally incapable of making effective even such opinions as transitory conditions allowed them to form. A very serious and further objection is that the arrival of a British Commission would gravely impair prestige and ability of two principals to control their respective followers and stimulate native fanaticism and hostility to foreigners. I am sure King Hussain w r ould on ^his account and with good reason oppose the despatch of a Commission. King Hussain’s withdrawal from personal direction of affairs at Hedjaz for period necessary to accomplish his meeting with Bin Saud at a neutral spot, for instance at Aden, would in present circumstances be open to serious risks. Baghdad, I imagine, would no doubt take a similar view as regards Bin Saud’s leaving his territory. This objection would not apply to representatives proceeding instead of the two principals but I am doubtful, as far as King Hussain is concerned, of a representative, to enable him to arrive at any satisfactory arrangement being given sufficient powers. I feel sure that the recommendation contained in the final paragraph of t serial No 62 my telegram J 1265 is only practicable one at present though I regret having to submit what merely seems destructive criticism.

Bin Baud has taken very ill our decision to discourage his hostilities against Bin Rashid, and has delivered what amounts to an ultimatum to us, coupled with an intimation that non-compliance will involve a rupture of relations. Mr. Philby has left Bin Baud's headquarters for Koweit, and is now on his way to Basra. On the other hand, the 1,000 rifles lying at Koweit have been released, and it is anticipated that their delivery will have a pacifying effect * # upon the situation. message should now be communicated to Bin Baud on the following lines (i) that His Majesty's Government are unable to present; (ii) that, in view of the fall of Damascus, His Majesty's Government see no rea.son to modify their decision that further t • &lt; hostilities against Bin Rashid are not called for; (iii) that they are prepared to continue the payment to him of his present subsidy of Captain Wilson recommends that a supply him with further arms for the V £ 10,000£10,000 a month till the end of the war, on the specific understanding that he complies with their orders; afld (iv) that failure to do so will involve the prompt discontinuance of the subsidy, and will compel His Majesty's Government to reconsider their attitude towards him. These terms appear to he in full accordance with the general policy of His Majesty's Government, and are covered, in part at least, by instructions already j issued. It is submitted that they may oe approved. 3. The question newt arises how the proposed message is to be delivered. It seems clearly desirable (and has already been decided in principle) that Mr. Philby should not return to Nejd. Captain Wilson's recent suggestion that he shoujd be replaced by an officer from Egypt - in order to 'put 'an end to the belief that our Arabian policies are 'not co-ordinated' - commended itself to the Eastern Committee; and Sir R. Wingate was accordingly invited to nominate an officer. He nominated Lieutenant- Colonel J.R.Bassett, but has since asked that action on his recommendations should be deferred. Captain Wilson now recommends that the prooosed message should be delivered by Lieutenant-Colonel G.E. Leachman, C.I.E., at present nnwniy: in political employ in Mesopotamia, whose 'virile handling of 'Arab tribes' is stated to have been of great value to the Mesopotamian force. In an earlier telegiaxii (15th September) Captain Wilson reported that , Colonel'posted with current developments in Arabia;... his 'experience and reputation, and his knowledge of 'Arab tribes from Aria to Riyadh, will ensure hirn a 'respectful hearing'. Colonel Leaclirnan is an officer of the British Service/- (Royal Sussex Regiment), and not a member of the Indian Political .Department. His selection would therefore be.free from the objection of perpetuating the old 'vicious circle'’^which Bin Baud’s affairs were handled through exclusively ’’Indian” channels. It is submitted that the Civil Commissioner’s proposal may be approved. There seems no very strong necessity for giving Colonel Leachman the rank of Brigadier- General for the purposes of his mission. ! i ♦Flagged on the file below. 4. Captain Wilson further raises the question of making a declaration to Bin Baud on the lines advocated in his telegram No. 6491 of the 7th August last, viz:- H Bin Baud to be informed in writing that Article 2 of Treaty of 26th December, 1915* applies equally to aggression by King Husain and that a special commission will be sent by His Majesty’s Government, as soon as conditions admit, to determine boundaries referred to in Article 1 of Treaty, and to conclude further agreement referred to in Article 7”.

This proposal was not approved at the time. The view taken (which appears to the Department clearly right)~ ri^ht) was that the guarantee ^iven in Article 2 of the Treaty a/minst 'agression by anv Foreign Power” was not intended to cover attack by a rival Arab Chief. It is submitted that, if further assurances ere to be p;iven to Bin Saud at the present sta/^e, they should not go beyond a general reassertion of our adherence to the Treaty of December, 1915, and of our intention to carry out its provisions in our own good time. 5. There remains the other side of the picture, vis:- the attitude of King Husain.* It seems clear that the latter was the aggressor in the recent fighting at Khurma, in which his forces suffered a severe reverse; and if the story of his treatment of Bin Baud’s overtures is true, he would appear to have put himself seriously in the wrong in relation to his rival. Nor does it appear that he has ever fulfilled his promise to Sir R. Wingate in August last* to write a friendly letter to Bin Saud on his own account. The fact that we are under greater obligations to the King than to the Emir ought not to blind us to the merits of the dispute between them. Moreover the doctrine of obligation has very distinct limits. King Husain is under infinitely greater obligations to us than we to him. We have planted his standard at Damascus, and opened up to him prospects which, but for our powerful assistance, were beyond his most extravagant hopes. He, on his side, has not yet succeeded even in expelling our * enemies from Medina. It is surely not too much to require him to act with forbearance and common courtesy * M Sherif of “Mecca has sent “grateful and, I 'consider, generally 'satisfactory reply 'to message from 'H.M’s Govt.

Department. courtesy towards other Arab Chieftains who, even though they may be the objects of his personal dislike and suspicion, are in treaty relations with the Power to whom he owes so much. The serious warning that Sir R. Wingate proposes to address to the King, vis:- that the outbreak of civil war in &lt; 'Arabia might gravely prejudice the favourable 'consideration of his and the Arabs’ claims at the &lt; 'Peace Conference', seems by no means too strong. It might be accompanied by a reminder that we are under Treaty obligations to Bin Saud, and are bound (and intend) to see that his just interests are preserved. The opportunity might also be taken to remind King Husain of his promise to write to Bin Baud, and to enquire whether the letter was ever desnatched. 6. The case is not without unfortunate features, and Bin Saud has some cause for dissatis faction with our change of policy between March and A *t**A in regard to 0 'his operations against Bin Rashid. But the main fact remains that we have smashed the Turks, and thus secured to him undisputed possession of Hasa and the coastal region south of Koweit. The total disappearance of Turkish influence from Arabia . is only a matter of time, and with it will disappear any serious menace to Bin Saud from his rival, Bin Rashid of Hail, or other pro-Turkish Arabs. The difficultyc *r difficulty with Kinn* Husain will remain. It is so deeply rooted in personal and sectarian differences that its adjustment will be a matter of extreme difficulty. The task is one to which we shall have to set ourselves after the war. In the meantime the only practicable policy seems to be to restrain the two Chieftains as far as possible from ap^ressive action apninst one another, and to make Bin Baud realise the situation which our military victories, and the circumstances in which they were achieved, have broupht about. 7. It does not seem necessary to bring the matter apain before the Eastern Committee at the present stage. But I would suggest that the draft telegram with the accompanying papers should be referred to Lord Curzon and Lord Robert Cecil for their approval, before issue. ^ ^ 0 *^ ftLx- jo^-A 0 ^ 4v/v If Jl O Ji £ * ffiKBl c ICLEAR THE LINE Telegram from Political, Baghdad X Dated 17th October 1918, Received at 10 p.m. 8820. 17th.

We have some to parting of the ways and I think it is urgent that Bin Baud should be made clearly to understand he must come into line and comply with orders of His Majesty’s Government or take the consequences. Events of last four years have given him, like other Arabian Chiefs, an&gt;^ exaggerated sense of his own importance and the present moment seems as favourable an any is likely to occur to bring him to his bearings. I recommend Philby whose position is now scarcely tenable should come to Bagdad forthwith for consultation and that Lt-Col. Leachman who is available immediately should be deputed in his p%ace with #he temporary rank of Brigadier-General to proceed without delay to Bin Baud to explain to him that (1) His Majesty's Government are unable to give him more arms at present, (2) in view of fall of Damascus His Majesty's Government see no reason to modify their orders already communicated to him that furtner hostilities against Bin Rashid are not called for, (5) nevertheless they are prepared to continue present subsidy of £10,000 per mensem till the end of the war but on specific understanding that Bin Baud complies with orders of His Majesty's Government, (4) failure to do so will involve prompt stoppage of his subsidy and will compel His Majesfer'fc Government to reconsider their policy towards him. I believe message on the above lines delivered by Leactonan whose virile handling of Arab tribes has been of such value to this Force will probably bring Bin Baud to his bearings and save much trouble in future.

During his absence which may be prolonged there is grave risk that Bin Baud may yield to pressure of his subjects and precipitate conflagration which His Majesty’s Government desire to avoid. Faced by alternatives of risking such an outbraa*: which would be particularly regrettable at the present juncture, or of taking action m anticipation of a &lt; reconsideration by His Majesty’s Government of previous orders, I have decided on latter course. In so doing I have been actuated primarily by fact that circumstances have materially changed since His Majesty’s government last nassed orders on case whilst from tenour of previous correspondence it is clear that a reversal of tnose orders will involve reference to G.O.C. Egyptian Force and inter- denartmental correspondence and consequently delay. l have telegraphed to Mr.Philby^to send 1,000 rifles to Bin Baud at once.

In these circurustances it is not for me to criticise orders of superior authority but it is my duty to report that these orders followed by stoppage of arms have produced profound sensation and Bin Baud makes no secret of his resentment at treatment (?reeeived) and of his,unwillingness to accept situation. (2) These orders crossed my telegram reporting (1) actual opening of campaign against Bin Rashid, (2) third Sharifian attack on Khurma resulting according to official report since received in defeat and flight of Shakir’s force with loss of two goms and two gmifchine guns, (3) Refusal of Sharif to accept delivery oi Bin Saud’s letter, (4) Fakhri’s offer to assist Bin Saud with arms etc., in campaign, against Sharif. Finally, it must be realised that change of policy following so closely on transfer of Sir P. Cox gives f round for suspicion in Bin Saud’s mind that Government as changed its policy towards him. (3) In view of above I should have exercised my discretion to withhold communication of orders to Bin^ Saud pending further reference to you but fact that his Koweit agent had reported stoppage of rifles forced my hand and left me no' alternative but to explain Govern ments orders. (4) Bin Saud who has all along regarded Government’s refusal to support him originally with arms etc., for Hail campaign as due to Sharif’s machinations regards latest orders as second triumph for Sharif. He declares it is not possible for him. now to withdraw from Hail campaign unless Government guarantee him immunity from attach by Bin Rashid. ArCdjfinally he points out that present orders fully justify criticism of his own subjects that the British alliance is contrary to true interests of Wahabi cause. His comments and criticisms are full „ of bitterness. 'Who” he says, **wiil trust you after this? (5) On above basis he formulates following ultimatum, viz*- (1) that the present active alliance against enemy should be reaffirmed and vigorously prosecuted by us by provision of arms etc., or, &gt; , . (2) if British Government desire him to remain inactive he is perfectly willing to fall in with their wishes provided that they guar ant edhim absolutely from all aggression by Ajman, Snanmar friendlies o.i ran Rashia and Sharif. This would involve cessation of attacks on Khurma. pending a decision of the boundary question. And he somewhatsoni6wh&amp;'t sarcastically adds that h© ©xpccts ^uararte© to be more effective than those of past. (6) He wished to reduce this ultimatum to writing prefaced by a tement of his grievances but I persuaded him to leave the j/iatter to further representations and negotiations and after much discussion it was agreed that without giving reasons he should allow part of his forces one month’s leave and that I should go to^Koweit and Bagdad to represent his case. He made it quite clear, however, that failing substantial acceptance of one of alternative given above he would consider himself free to act for the protection of his own interests and would not expect me to return. S I am accordingly on way to Koweit and expect to arrive / or two after this. Request permission to come tp Bagdad and provision of quickest possible means of conveyance from Basra as time is important. At present not necessary to say more except that failihg satisfactory arrangement Bin 'Baud will certainly devote his first efforts to getting eyen with Sharif and his resentment at us would probably drive him into arms of Fakhri to secure armaments and funds. Situation is extremely serious and would recommend that if you think there is a ^ reasonably negotiable case orders may be issued for immediate removal of embargo on arms and payment of funds^ (?arranged) for first Muharram as already reported.

I will•ask for (?explanation) of letter incident from King Hussein and if (?as it appears) he. has publicly flouted Ibn Baud’s overtures will represent strongly that this action contradicts his earlier declarations to us. Position is that King wholly-distrusts Ibn Baud and is fearful of political effects of Ikwan activity. His recent reverse in Khurrna neighbourhood (as reported) by (?7ar Office) -but not yet confirmed from this side) will not ease situation for long as King is now pretty sure to withdraw tribal levies from Medina or regulars from Northern Arab armies ostensibly to restore confidence at Taif and Mecca. I think we must accept facts of regrettable situation which cannot be relieved by discussion and should make it perfectly clear that if straight fight between the King and Ibn Baud ensues we shall not withdraw our support from the former. I should also propose to warn the King that outbreak of civil war in Arabia might gravely prejudice favourable'consideration of his and Arabs claims at peace' conference. Allied and Arab victories in-Ssfria should pre clude possibility of Ibn Saud obtaining Turkish aid and dis pose him to avoid open hostilities against the King whose power is obviously much increased by Arab occupation of Damascus and Beirut and rally Syrians to his standard.

Af ' (Repeated to Foreign and Cairo.) * i ;U- (Received 14th, 10 a.m.) 8620. Philby writes 26th September. “Had long interview with I bn Sand this morning. Your telegram authorising me to draw on Koweit up to 10,000h per mensem and sanctioning issue by Political Agent of Stores asked for by me arrived most opportunely last night. “ Other favourable factors were Ibn Saud’s high elation of his own recent successes and the fourth victory of Akhwan of Khurma. The fact that Ibn Sand has actually begun his campaign and cannot withdraw from it even if he wants to is of utmost importance, while the proved ability of Khurma to resist attack(s) of Sharif has temporarily obviated necessity of active intervention from Ibn Saud’s point of view. “ Summary of interview as follows : — “ (1) As regards Khurma, Ibn Sand points out with justice that hitherto he has guaranteed inactivity of people of Khurma as far as offensive by them concerned on condition that Sharif refrains from further attacks. Sharif has now deliberately transgressed that condition. He accordingly formallv withdraws his guarantee and declines any further responsibility for activity of Khurma people and their Allies. At the same time he has given me his pledge that, provided we help him in his present campaign and Sharif refrains from hostile actions against him excluding Khurma, he will in no wa\ intervene in Khurma affair or assist them in any offensive they may undertake. At the same time he will not prevent Najd people going to their help. It should be remembeied in giving this pledge he is largelv influenced by confidence that Khurma is capable of looking after itself while ive can lessen numbers of Najdis available to join Khurma by enabling Bin Saud to concentrate large forces for the Hail operations. Continuance of Sherifan attacks will result in progressive embitterment of relations with Najd (? which cannot) but end in violent hostilities. Dor the time being, however, and while Hail operations continue, venture to add my own guarantee that Bin Saud will not attack Sharif without full warning to Government of his intentions. I still press for temporary fixing of boundary line as suggested and discontinuance of futile attacks prejudicial alike to dignity of Sharif and prospect of Arabian peace now T and hereafter. “ (2) As regards Hail operations Bin Saud has now sent out orders for full muster of whole military force of Central Najd, which should exceed 20,U00 men, which is'probably in excess of available modern rifles. To keep these continuously in the field he asked for guarantee of regular funds, and after some discussion I agreed to paying him 10,000k per month so long as he continued his activities to my satisfaction. The money to be paid at Koweit in dollars at current rate of 7 per £, i.e., $70,000 on the first Muharram and each succeeding Musalman month to Abdulla Hellfisi unless instructions to the contrary received from me. Should be obliged if you wmuld kindly confirm this arrangement by issue of orders to Political Agent who will kindly note this matter carefully. I have further agreed in anticipation of your sanction to supply of provisions for two months at a time on scale already sanctioned for one issue. Next issue to be on first day of Rabi Khawwal, i.e., 3,000 bags rice, 200 sugar, and 200 coffee. Kindly sanction to enable Political Agent to reserve necessary quantities from stocks held bv him. ~ “ (3) As regards arms Bin Saud begging for one quick-firing, one siege modern gun with personnel, also for more rifles. In both cases I have informed him I cannot hold out any hope in this direction. Nevertheless, venture to press for acceptance of my former proposal re rifles or any smaller number, say, 3,000 or 2,000, considered sufficient. As regards guns much depends whether actual opening of campaign creates desire in Governme nt to press matter vigorously. If it does a couple of guns, or better still a couple of bombing planes would make all the difference in the world. Venture to recommend latter as experiment. Otherwise leave matter to your sympathetic consideration (? in view of Fakhris) generous offer.^ If guns sent they should be sent at once with officer and personnel. Bin Saud will transport. “ (4) Bin Saud has conceded permission for me to accompany him in all future operations. His previous refusal probably due not so much to Akhwan objections as to nervousness how they would shape in the field. He is now full of confidence.” My comments follow.Dated 11th October 1918.

Then getting wind of Bin Saud s movement, hastened back to Sabaan, where he had left his baggage. (2) Meanwhile Bin Satid was delayed three days at Tarafiya owing to non-appearance of Ghatgat contingent, and arrived at Qusaiba about 13th, whence he marched next day to Ajfar wells, one day east of Hail. “ (- 9 &gt;) Shammar, at A1 Sidr wells, one day east-north-east of Hail, had decamped, and patrol reported Bin Rashid at Sabaan for Id festival 16th. Bin Sand marched on 17th to A1 Sidr, whence on the 18th he sent out two parties under Fahad Bin Muammar and Faisal Bin Hashra, himself with main force following. “(4) lahad reported that Bin Rashid had hastily returned to Hail, leaving Bin Shuraim with baggage in Qasrs of Sabaan, and Faisal reported that Beni 5 asraf section of Shammar with great herd of camels and sheep occupied line of Dhaba Akkass Sefaila, last named being about a mile east of Hail. Meanwhile, Bin Rashid with retainers had thrown themselves in stronghold Maaiwij Baqaa, about three hours north-east of Hail in hills, leaving garrison to defend Hail. ‘‘ (5) Bin Saud, keeping strong reserve for emergencies, launched Akhwan on Sufaila, where they killed 30 of Beni ^ ahraf and captured whole of herd of camels, said to number 3,000, countless sheep, themselves losing two men and three horses killed. Number of camels doubtless exaggerated, but is certainly very large. Cavalry rode round wal ls of Hail, challenging sortie, and were fired upon with rifles but no artillery! “ v0) Council of war decided against attempting attack on Maaiwij stronghold, and Bin Saud retired with booty to A1 Sidr. “ (7) During retirement of rear patrol, three men captured convoy of five camels on the way from Hail to Bin Rashid with ammunition. Total amount, 10,000 rounds of ammunition. “ (8; Reaching Ajfar, Bin Saud on the morning of 22nd began retirement towards Qusaiba with patrols out watching Bin Rashid. If latter remains where he is Bin Saud will probably return to Tarafiya where I hope to rejoin him on 25th. “ (9) Summary. Providential opportunity of catching Bin Rashid in J open has been badly missed owing to dilatory tactics. Nevertheless, | material gain of camels, sheep and ammunition is considerable and most l important factor is mor al effec t of opening of campaign and by penetration of arms of Bin Saud to gate of Hail and inability of Bin Rashid to accept challenge. I believe this is first time since independence of Hail that Bin Saud invader has looked on capital. Above is ground for both satisfaction and redoubled caution as Bin Rashid is in honour bound to take up challenge and will spare no effort to collect forces from Shammar now receiving allowances from us. Campaign has opened with excellent prospects and trust most strenuous efforts will be made to keep subsidised section in their places.”fThis 3 ocmnnieifflt is the Property of His BHtarmic iVlajesty's Govemitnent, and shouTd be r»etmr»ined to the Foreign Office if not required for official use.] ‘ .V ,r -’ J i S t ^ IT'fiVp T (15189 3/;//44) .

Philby added : “ The (? 1,000) rifles recently arrived are also subject to unfavourable criticism. Regret I am not sufficiently expert in matter of arms to pronounce on such criticisms but request either (1) that I be given expert assurance that rifles are for all practical puiposes good and serviceable; or (2) that an equal number of good and serviceable weapons be issued in exchange, preferably Enfield carbines. Comparison of rifles issued by us to (?Sherif) and by Turks 10 Il)n Rashid creates dissatisfaction at palming off inferior weapons on Nejd. Regret am personally partly responsible for selection of present nfles, but plead lack of expert knowledge. So far as I remember was assuied by Ordnance that rifles were serviceable. Matter urgent and beg treatment on generous lines.” The rifles in question were *303 Winchester rifles and were reported quite serviceable by Ordnance. They are identical with those issued to other Chiefs in Gulf and South Persia, but are doubtless inferior to those issued in Hedjaz or by Turks. _ Philby now writes under date 1st August:—“ 1,000 rifles now received. Bin Sand is grievously disappointed at having such wretched weapons palmed off on him. I accept responsibility for mistake made in circumstances already explained, but beg that no time be lost in replacing them with really serviceable rifles selected b} 7 responsible expert.

(Repeated to Civil Commissioner, Baghdad.) Foreign Secret. Your telegram of 2nd September and connected correspondence. His Majesty’s Government have had whole question under further careful consideration. Military authorities here think it desirable in present military situation that Bin Sand should be kept as quiet as possible, and should be restrained if possible from military activity'or aggressive action in any direction. For this reason they _ are against increasing his armed strength or encouraging him to attack Bin Rashid at present juncture. This view is strongly supported by General Officer Commanding, Egypt, on military grounds, and is accepted by His Majesty’s Government) We appreciate force of Philby’s plea for offensive against Hail as furnishing Bin Sand with diversion desiderated in my telegram of 2nd August, but apart from fact that capture of Hail might m itself precipitate rupture with King Husain, we consider that balance of advantage lies in policy of marking time as recommended by military authorities. In the circumstances we cannot for present modify decision not to supply^ 1,000 short rifles. Philby should explain to Bin Saud that His Majesty’s Government, while much concerned to learn that rifles already supplied do not give satisfaction, regret^ that the}’ do not at present see their way to replace them. They will, however, bear Bin Saud’s requirements in mind, and may be able to meet him to some extent at a later date.

Secretary of State’s telegram, 14th September. \ am reluctant to ask for reconsideration of a deliberate decision of higher authority, the more so because 1 have no fresh facts to adduce. 1 think it my duty, however, to record my opinion that the refusal of His Majesty’s Govern ment to replace 1,000 rifles is calculated to precipitate conflagration apprehended in your telegram 2nd August in reply to which on 17th August I proposed that 1,000 rifles should be sent. As will be seen from my telegram of 7th August 1 only suggested operations against Hail because 1 was satisfied that little would result there from. In this connection see Hamilton’s notes forwardefcLwith Arab Bureau, Baghdad Memorandum, 23rd April. The despatch oMl,000 rifles is in itself of no serious military importance. Good British i^les sold by Sherif’s adherents can be purchased for cash anywhere in Central Arabia and have recently found their way'to Bushire hinterland. Ammunition is not so easy to come by, but of this 150,000 rounds [? have been] sanctioned enough for 1,000 rifles, though Ibn Sand already has 250,000 in hand, vide my telegram of 17th August. The refusal will disgust Ibn Sand and alienate from the latter the sympathy of his adherents who, as already reported, are by no means content at the results which have accrued from his espousal of British cause. Ibn Sand is not so strong as might be thought from a perusal of current official literature. Finally His Majesty’s Government must be prepared to hear Mr. Philby on receipt of final intimation of the refusal has found necessary to terminate his mission and leave for coast.

Ac already reported Shereef of Mecca is in a very difficult and suspicious frame of mind. He expresses his willingness to receive brother of Bin Baud at any time and to do him the honour but he omits any reference to British representatives being present and frankly expresses his dL.slj.ke of Ikhwan sect which he stigmatises as a political society working under guise of religion to detriment of Arab interests. I fear that no good (?wlll omitted) come of meeting immediately and until a political officer has previously discussed matters fully with Abdulla.

(Note by Political Department, India Office.) 1. T-iio recent heavy crop of telegrams on this subject have somewhat obscured the main issues, and it may make for convenience if a statement is placed before the Eastern Committee at this stage dealing comprehensively with the whole question. 2. It is the case, as pointed out in Baghdad telegram of the 15th September, that the recent orders of His Majesty’s Government involve some departure from the policy adopted in March last. In his telegram of the 9th March 1918 Sir P. Cox submitted the following recommendations, which were approved by His Maiestv’s Government:— &lt;£ We recognise he [he., Bin Sand] may not find it possible to undertake operations on such a large scale as to enable him to capture Hail, and our operations are proceeding so Avell in Syria that we feel that there is no necessity to press him unduly in this connection, but at any rate it is still most important that he should maintain more effective control in Qasim and stop smuggling and put real pressure on Shammar. To this end we are prepared to assist him with 1,000 more rifles, 100.000 rounds, which Mr. Philby will place at his disposal as necessity arises. He may also regard as a gift the advance of two months’ subsidy made him by Mr. Philby. “ As regards Hail, I do not consider Ibn Saudis really keen on taking it except in circumstances which make it apparent that he is doing so at our bidding and under our direction. At the same time, should good opportunity arise for his doing so, either by diplomacy or force, with above meagre assistance, I understand there would be no objection to it in principle, either on the part of His Majesty’s Government or High Commissioner. If it should come to pass, I think we should be prepared to double Ibn Sand’s subsidy or give him good lump sum. I trust general approval will be telegraphed to our proceeding on above lines, and that General Officer Commanding may be authorised to supply rifles.” 3. The recent orders, conveyed in the Secretary of State’s telegram of 13th September, laid it down that £ ‘ Bin Sand should be kept as quiet as possible and “ should be restrained if possible from military activity or aggressive aciion in any ££ direction ; ” and that His Majesty’s Government were “against increasing his armed strength or encouraging him to attack Bin Rashid at the present juncture.” In other words, our attitude towards the Hail expedition has changed from somewhat lukewarm support to actual discouragement. 4 * * 4. It may well be doubted whether Bin Saud would, in any circumstances, have seriously pressed an offensive against Bin Rashid. But the policy of encouraging him to pursue the project had at least the advantage of diverting his activities from channels likely to bring him into collision with the King of the Hejaz. The enmity between these two Arab chieftains is deep-seated. It reflects many years of rivalry between Mecca and Riadh, aggravated by the personal jealousy between the two men and by the sectarian feud between Sunni and Wahabi. King Husain, apart from personal animosity, appears to be genuinely apprehensive of the spread of the Wahabi movement, of which Bin Saud is the figurehead, in the direction of the Hejaz. This feeling was probably at the back of his recent action at Khurma, which is the immediate subject of dispute with Bin Saud. For the moment the situation is eased. Bin Saud is reported to have found a temporary diversion in the Koweit direction, where the Ajman and other tribesmen are engaging his attention ; while the King, probably as a result of our representations, shows a disposition- not to force the pace at Khurma. But we cannot count on more than a breathing space, and the trouble between the two chiefs is certain to revive unless some modus vivendi can be found between them.5 The statement printed as an appendix to tins Note shows the line that we have taken with Bin Sand in the matter, and his own attitude towards our efforts to promote reconciliation. The first question that arises is that of the proposed meeting between the tiro Chiefs. King Husain has offered to visit his rival. Bin Sand evidently regards the offer with suspicion, hut is piepaied to agiee to a meeting on certain conditions. Mr. Philby fears that a meeting might lead to conflict rather than reconciliation, and “would on the whole recommend that visit be not encouraged.” Sir R. Win mite is strongly of opinion that a meeting between the two principals “ could serve no useful purpose,” and emphasises the objection to withdrawing King Husain for any considerable period from the personal direction of Hejaz affairs. He is more favourably inclined, however, to an alternative suggestion made by the Foreign Office that an interview should be arranged between one of the King’s sons and a brother of Bin Sand, and he is taking steps to sound the King in the matter. The result of these steps may perhaps be awaited. 6. The second question is that of British representation with Bin Sand. The Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, has warned us that the result of the refusal of His Majesty’s Government to replace the 1,000 unserviceable Winchester rifles presented to Bin Sand may be that Mr. Philby will find his position an impossible one, and that he will be compelled to terminate his mission and leave for the coast. In a subsequent telegram Captain Wilson has suggested that Mr. Philby, whom he regards as having “ reached the end of his tether,” so far as his mission to Nejd is concerned, should be allowed to proceed on leave, and should be replaced by an officer from Egypt, whose deputation “ would allay King Husain’s suspicions and put an end to the belief that our Arabian policies are not co-ordinated.” In a still later telegram, dealing with future British policy in Arabia as a whole, Captain Wilson recommends that “it should now be ruled that, though the affairs of Bin Sand will continue to be “ dealt with by His Majesty’s Government through Baghdad, henceforward any officer “ sent to Bin Saud will normally be a selection t)f the High Commissioner, Cairo, who “ will be kept for the present fully informed of all developments.” Without prejudice to the question of a general ruling on the lines advocated by the Civil Commissioner, the Department ventures to think that there is much to be said for a change of representation with Bin Saud at the present juncture. In the first place, as explained above, the policy which Mr. Philby was sent to Riadh to carry out has been modified, and there seems advantage in making the new departure synchronize with the appointment of a new agent. The latter will be more favourably placed than our present representative, who is deeply committed to the old policy, for giving effect to the revised instructions of His Majesty’s Government. Secondly, much benefit might accrue from bringing ; a “new angle of vision” to bear upon the affairs of Bin Saud. I here has been too much of a tendency in the past for the two rival chieftains Bin Saud and King Husain to find their respective champions in India and Egypt, and for the whole controversy between them to be reflected in a conflict of view between the two gieat administrations concerned. It is scarcely to be supposed that this aspect of the case, or the possibility of turning it to advantage, is lost upon the c neftams themselves. I he appointment of an Egyptian officer to Riadh would do much to correct these tendencies and to bring it home, both to Bin Saud and to the King, that there is unity in the counsels of ilis Majesty’s Government. 7. Thirdly, there remains the question of the 1,000 rifles. The Department is most reluctant to revive a proposal on which the Eastern Committee has twice lecoided an adverse decision. • But Captain WTlson is strongly of opinion that our N us fl |.° 7 * * 10 P tlC T ^ ^ ^serviceable rifles may have very unfortunate consequences; i wi isgust Bin Saud and will alienate from him the sympathy of his adherents wiio, even as it is are “by no means content with the results that have accrued from ns espousal of the British cause.” The pressure of public opinion, as the Civil om miss loner seems to hint, may even prove strong enough to override Bin Sand’s Realty to ourselves. Captain Wilson also reports that the General Officer Com- mandnig, Baghdad, agrees with him that the replacement of the 1,000 rifles is expedient m present circumstances.” Attention is drawn to General Marshall’s view because it was primarily on military grounds that the recent decision of His . ajesty s Goveinment was based. The arguments for and against the supply of the rifles were discussed m a previous Memorandum circulated to the Committee and it is nut proposed to recapitulate them here. But it may be recalled that the proposition,NMMHMIMn ^?HI&gt; ''llB—I lllll I 111 '■■-lill 4-0 C o O ^ z: . v; . \ f 7 , 1 ^uaui.y, ana men retase to make good tbe deficiency. It is to be feared that the whole transaction will wear an appearance of sharp practice, which, m dealing with Arabs, it is most desirable to avoid. It may here be remarked that the Civil Commissioner does not support Mr. Philbv’s proposals for supplying Bin Sand with arms and ammunition on a further considerable scale ; and in any case these pioposals, winch were framed on the assumption that Bin Sand was to be encouraged to operate against Hail, are ruled out by the recent pronounce ment of policy by His Majesty’s Government. 8. A few general observations may, perhaps, be added. As mentioned above, the indications are that an early collision between Bin Sand and King Husain on the Khurma question need not be anticipated. Probably both Chiefs have taken to heart the warnings of His Majesty’s Government. General Allenby’s recent victory in Palestine, the full extent of which is uncertain at the time of writing, should have a steadying influence on the wdrole situation. It ought to remove from Bin Sand’s mind any lingering suspicion that he has “ put his money on the wrong horse.” At the same time, the contribution of the Hejaz forces towards the British success—if it proves to be as considerable as the early reports seem to indicate—will serve to emphasise the view, already plainly enunciated by His Majesty’s Government, that King Husain’s services and commitments to the common cause are out of all comparison with those of Bin Rand. This does not, of course, mean that we are to disregard the latter’s just interests or to fail to carry out the terms of the treaty of December 1915, under wdiich we (1) recognised his sovereignty over certain specified areas, to _ be delimited hereafter ” ; and (2) guaranteed his territories against “aggression bv any Foreign Ikwver.” But it does mean that we are on firm ground in restraining him from extravagant claims against his rival, and in requiring him to abstain from action likely to create strife and disunion among the Arab peoples. 9. To sum up, the Department ventures to recommend— (i) that as regards the proposal to arrange a meeting between representatives of Bin Saud and King Husain, a further report from Cairo should be awaited ; (ii) that Sir K. Wingate should be invited to depute an officer of the'Egyptian service to succeed Mr. Philby as British representative with Bin Saud ; (iii) that the question of supplying Bin Saud wdth 1,000 serviceable rifles in substitution for the inferior weapons already delivered to him should be considered.

(As authorized by Secretary of State’s telegram, loth August UtlS.) 1 We recognise our obligations to use every influence in our power to prevent encroachments upon Bin Sand’s territories, but feel that , is impossible to decide Ton merdts of individual cases until the precise limits of his territories have been discussed and laid down as provided for m the Iieaty. 2 King Husain has given us emphatic assurances that his action against the rebel Sheikh Emir Khaled of Khurma is local and is not directed against Bm Sand, and that he entertains no hostile designs against the lattei. 3 King Husain is writing a friendly letter to Bin Sand, and appears most anxious for a reconciliation, which His Majesty’s Government feel would be to the grea advantage of both parties and of Arabs m general. King Husain hits ofieied to visit Bin Sand himself with a view to discussing such reconciliation. 4. His Majesty's -Government are prepared to give their good offices to both parties on behalf of such a reconciliation and an amicable adjustment of their outstandihg difficulties ; but they cannot but feel that the present time of war and stress is unfavourable to a final settlement of complicated questions such as exact delimitation of boundaries. 5. In the meantime, all Arab leaders should combine against the common enemy, and in their dealings with each other should exercise patience and conciliation, and use every endeavour to localise disputes. (&gt;. We will rectify tire blockade arrangements in some manner acceptable to Bin Sand, or if unable to do so, will not hold him responsible for leakage of supplies. 7. We will see that Bin Sand’s material resources do not suffer by reason of any hostilities undertaken by him on our behalf. Bin Saud’s Reply. A.

As regards King Husain’s offer to visit bim (clause 3), Bin Sand expresses appreciation and gratitude, and is ready to meet the King ; but he doubts whether such an expedition on the part of the latter may not be used as a cloak for the collection of forces with the object of subsequent diversion against Kburma.

Government involve a substantial departure from the policy embodied in Sir P. Cox’s telegram of $th March as approved in Secretary of State’s telegram of 20th March. Under pressure of circumstances this policy has been somewhat modified in execution on the spot and Philby’s very full telegrams indicate that his views and sympathy have a contrary trend, Philby has been absent for about a year of which he has spent more than half in Central Arabia under conditions of some discomfort and complete isolation, He)£has travelled widely and his experiences will be most valuable material for students and travellers but so far as his mission to Ibn Baud is concerned I think he has reached the end of his tether. I recommend that he be permitted to proceed on leave which is long overdue to him. It is however essential that he should be replaced and that his successor should be an officer of no less and if possible of higher standing otherwise hostilities between Sharif and Ibn Saud are likely to ensue at once. From many points of view it is preferable that he should be succeeded by a nominee, of the High Commissioner of equivalent status m the Sharif’s confidence # and ^i°h a first hand knowledge of conditions in the Hedjaz and I would suggest that Sir R. Wingate be asked to 4 send one if available. The deputation of such an pfficer would allay King Husain’s suspicions and put an end to the belief that our Arabian policies are not co-ordinated. If he is unable to do so I am prepared to send Brevet Lt-Col, Leachman fho should be given the temporary rank of Brigadier General for tae purpose of his mission and should be accompanied by a secpnd Political Officer of his own selection from this force.

(1) We are all agr ed that we are committed to Heiaz. (2) It is not a case of transferring our affections to Bin Baud; he has been with us and had them all along. (3) Oar policy was at any rate until now to be friendly with both. (4) That is G-. of I. policy now supported (see recent telegram) by Bagdad. * (5) You fear that Pin Baud will use 1,000 rifles against Heiaz and won’t so use 100. I fear if you insult him or refuse support he will go against He.jaz alone. (6) Policy agreed by Pastern Co mittee on advice of Wingate and G. of I. was to send Bin Baud'Winchester rifles necessary to preserve good relations. (7) You are fold what the number is and now wisl to go back on the policy agreed because you think number too many. , (8) So it is you and not G. of I. that has a new policy. (9) It is new and not old policy which is likely to a+id-your relations with He.jaz. (10) Have you considered asking conditions from Bin Saud? (11) You use this as argument for Middle East Dept. It seems to me against it, for if it is relevant at all (it all arose after yo*..y proposal) it slows tie great importance of letting India have its say when it feels we are unnecessaryly spoiling relationswith allies.

Arab Bureau hand hook of Hedjaz was very hastily com piled and in absence of better information restricted Hedjaz Hastern boundary to limits of former effective Turkish control. Since his succession to the Bmirate in 1908 the Sherif certainly exercised authority to the Hast and I have already referred - see my telegram Mo. 1308 - to 1910 Treaty (concluded after a sherifial expedition to Q,uasim)under w iich Harb Ateibah Suhai and kuteir tribesmen were relieved from taxation by either Ibn Baud or Ibn lash id, It cannot therefore be said that Kurma no con nection with the Sherif's jurisdiction prior to Arab His appointment of Khalid there as Emir is evidence contrary and whatever we may think of his discretion revolt to the in choosing- 2 ~ choosing present moment to assert this authority a glance at the map showing the situation of K(urma) ir Taif will exnlain why he could not be exacted to disinterest himself in increase of Wahabite activity there.

My immediately preceding telegram. Philby Regarding suggestion to divert Ibn Sand’s attention have hacT that purpose in mind for long time and have come to following conclusions :—- (1) 1 hat Khnrma affair lias gone too far and created too much feeling amongst people ol Nejd to allow of any satisfactory solution other than imposition of mutual hands-off policy on both sides for the period of the war. Am perfectly convinced that even if Ibn Sand can be persuaded to hold aloof renewed attacks on Khurma will result in widespread conflagration, which once started will be impossible to control. Turks in Asir and frU Madina and k can scarcely fail to profit by such situation. u (2) Assume 1 ^} ? A above settlement Khurma trouble it is always possible that some petty event or another of Badawin life will raise Ataiba problem or that of boundary generally, and am convinced desirable to divert Ibn Sand’s attention from such matters. Nevertheless, am convinced that mere gift of money or profitable land will not serve purpose,*as such gifts would still leave -f- ? -)■ idle. In any case doubt if he would accept gift of land in Mesopotamia and terms; doubt wisdom of introducing Wahhabi element into country. “ (3) In my opinion real activity is only panacea for ills arriving (sic ? arising) from natural indolence pf life of Arabs and this conclusion 1 have kept steadily in view in connection with proposed operations against Haii. With limited resources at my disposal I have not been able to do very much but have felt natural reluctance to abandon Hait offensive. Nevertheless, had it not been for such dispositions as 1 have been able to make no changes would have been ready for diversion of warlike feeling consequent upon first attack on Khurma. As it is, forth coming offensive has been a Godsend, as mobilisation at worst enables Ibn Saud to collect his forces and keep them content by regular feeding and indirect control. Unfortunately the money laid out in this venture will not last for ever, and at present cannot say.how long mobilisation will hold good. I am [three groups undecipherable] have nothing to fall back on, but am emboldened by His Majesty’s Government’s present views to reopen subject. “ Feel perfect confidence can keep large force actively employed in operations against Halt and neighbourhood if Government can place more arms and money at my disposal and my proposals as follows : — “ First, as regards artillery, am of opinion that owing to loss of time for training no guns can be used. “ Secondly, as regards small arms, would request that 5,000 rifles of good type with corresponding ammunition be sent to Koweit to be doled out by Political Agent on my requisition. Essential that Ibn Saud and his Koweit agent should know nothing of this. I would propose to let him have 1,000 at once, and to dole out rest in event of Sherifian crisis practically as bribes for inaction that direction. “ Thirdly, money is all important, as Ibn Sand cannot keep his forces in the field without feeding them. Would suggest, therefore, I be given monthly allotment of 10,000L or that I be allowed to draw at discretion on Koweit up to total maximum of 50,000L up to end of December. Essential allotment be to me and not to Ibn Saud, as can then count on getting good value. “Finally, trust above proposals will receive favourable consideration. In anticipation of acceptance in principle am asking Political Agent, Koweit, to supply 3,000 bags of rice, 200 coffee, 200 sugar, t l0 Ibn Sand’s agent, from stores, and by him, and debit it to Mission. Have told Ibn Saud to send for above on understanding that he will have to pay for them in due course. Kindly sanction issue. Trust may receive early reply to this. Am handing over 3,000 bags rice, 200 coffee, to Abdullah Nafisi, no sugar available. Am charging cost price phis 10 per cent, to cover go down rent commission.” §(rt\ My comment follows.mmm From Political, Baghdad, 1th September 1918. {Repeated to Foreign and Cairo.) (Received 8th September, 2 p.m.) (R.) 7118. 7th. On receipt of Secretary of State for India two telegrams of 2nd August, Phil by wrote under date 18th August as follows r m ^ j Prv\! h 1, 1. Aftei careful consideration have decided to defer conciliatory message until His Majesty’s Government have considered my report of 25th June and subsequent correspondence. Delivery of such' message if followed by His Majesty’s Government’s summary decision that Khurma falls outside sphere in which intervention by Ibn Sand warranted would but create suspicion in his mind regarding our impartiality. Please await my letter up which deals exhaustively with case. Request that I may then receive definite orders regarding delivery and exact form of message. Meanwhile situation continues steady as far as I bn Sand concerned owing to His Majesty's Government’s original message, and I have found him extremely accommodating. For this reason consider it impolitic to disturb his tranquillity until His Majesty’s Government have had full opportunity to consider case in all bearings. “ 2. Venture to think His Majesty’s Government will revise opinion based on distance of Khurma from Taif. As already pointed out Khurma is only 10 miles east boundary^hiqum and Subai tribes, namely, Shaib Shaba. Question at issue therefore is jurisdiction over w'estern section Subai tribe whose capital is Khurma and whose eastern boundary is Wadi Naim 120 miles east of Khurma. Adjudication of Khurma to Sherif therefore necessarily implies extending boundary of Hedjaz to line about 200 miles or more east of Taif. This brings up question of Ataiba highlands extending another 100 miles eastwards of Wadi Naim, and as Sherif claims jurisdiction over Ataiba, the boundary of Najd falls back very nearly to line Tuwaiq. “ I earnestly represent— “ (1) that matter is far more complicated than is supposed and has two sides ; “(2) that Ibn Sand cannot abandon Khurma to its fate without risking widespread. disturbance of Najd tribes, whose first act in any case would be to attack Sherif with help of southern tribes ; and “ (3) that in any case Khurma will never submit to Sherifian attacks, while every unsuccessful attempt of Sherif makes the feeling of central Arabia increasingly unfavourable to us. According to my information considerable numbers of Najd troops formerly serving Sherif’s forces have come away owing to Sherif’s attitude of hostility to Najd and recently) Ataiba Sheikhs as significant; “ (4) have never ceased to make clear to Ibn Sand that owing to active participation in war and general political consideration, His Majesty’s Government will not suffer any prejudice to Sherif’s interests. At same time have made terms clear that His Majesty’s Government will without fail protect Ibn Saud’s legitimate interests. He asks for no more than that, and as already frequently reported, is ready to submit all disputed matters to British Government on above basis. At same time he is deter mined to surrender none of his legitimate claims to aggression by Sherif. Venture to submit that no exception can be taken to above attitude, and that he has proved in various ways LFFF in his letter to Sherif sincerity of his desire for peaceful solution.” i j * 7 “ (ovM a. eC,SECRET ijo .. vVar Office.

Af$0 A Brit/ish conirnission ignorant/ of local affairs and tradition would be involved in a maze of tribal politics and (? sectarian) disputes and totally incapable of making selective even such opinions as transitory con ditions allowed them to form, A further and very serious objection is that arrival of a British Commission would stimulate native and fanatic hostility to foreigners and would gravely impair prestige and ability of the two principals to control their respective followers* King Hussein, I am sure, “Would oppose despatch of a commission on this account - and with good reason, Withdrawal of King Hussein from personal direction of Hedjaz affairs for ^-CTiod necessary to accomplish his meeting with ibn Baud at a neutral spot (e 8 g, Aden) would be open to serious risk in present circumstances. I imagine that Bagdad would take a similar view as regards Ibn Baud leaving his territory. This objection would not apply to representatives proceeding instead of the two principals but - as far as action of Hussein is concerned - I doubt a representative being given sufficient powers to enable him to arrive at any satisfactory arrangement 6 I regret having to submit what merely seems destruc tive criticism but I feel sure that recommendation in final paragraph of ny telegram 1265 is the only practicable one at present.

To offer Bin Saud one hundred rifles making good defects of 1,000 cheap Winchester rifles previously given as effective weapons is calculated rather to offend than to conciliate and before this is finally decided we must urge a reconsideration. Bin Saud is already suspicious of our sincerity and sore over Kurma business, since Kurma is well oubside Msday Hedjaz limits as defined by handbook of the Hedjaz published by Cairo Arab Bureau and had apparently no connection with s Sherriff’jurisdiction prior to Arab revolt. In such a frame of mind Bin Saud to whom news of our successes in the West percolates slowly and with little effect may quite probably throw off allegiance to us and either make peace with Turks and join Bin Rashid against King Husain or raise Wahabi standard and emoark on campaign of his own against Hedjaz. It would surely be a mistake in our endeavours to placate King Husain to throw Arabia inuo such internecine strife apart from our obligations ^ ca i Bin Saud our earlier ally amongst Arab potentates.

The idea of the Brotherhood is to give up raiding and tahe up agriculture and oommeroe, rith the result that their numbers have greatly increased and are said to have spread as far West as Khurma and Heooa. Owing to the feeling and anger raised among the Akhwan by Hussein's allianoe with the British,they look on the Hejd men in his armies as infidels and on their return home compel them to renew their confession of faith and their marriage oelebrations. The Akhwan attribute to Hussein the delay in this years Haj and maintain that no one should be prevented from going. They state that the Emir of Meooa appears to be an official whpse appointment and dismissal is in the hands of the British. ±8 regards the i&amp;urua affair the Akhwan state that Hussein recently endeavourOa to take from the Ateibah, but as the latter belonged to the Brotherhood Jhey had paid their tithes to Ibn Saud.

It is a S Bedouin societj^ which exists to pronote the spread of pure peligion in the extreme Wahabi sense among the different tribes of Arabia, The abolition of all inter-tribal warfare is one of its cardinal doctrines. Three hundred and more of these Akhwan are being educated in Riadh to be religious teachers of the different tribes,. They are supported by Ibn Baud and according to Emir Feisal f 80/2 of the Nejdis belong to the society, entry into which appears to be easy. The society numbers many thousands in many different tribes and enthusiastically supports the present ruling house in Riadh. In December last &amp;Xr Eeieal stated that the Taif branch of the society was rapidly winning over the tribes of Northern Yemen, that the Zelair men were influencing the Shamiyah Arabs that one fourth of the Shammar have allied them selves to the society and that only the energy of Nuri Shaalan has kept its influence out of the Anazah Emir Eeisal^ conversation with Colonel Lawrence on the Akhwan and Emir Abdullah 1 s attempts to combat the spread of their doctrine is reported in full in Arab Bulletin No. 74 pages 511-512-513.

A discussion between them, held under our auspices and direction night clear the air and facil itate a settlement, at the worst time would be gained, as both would be liicely to remain quiescent pending uae meeting, liy suggestion would be that we should propose to cans Kuoeein and Ibn Baud that we should send a strong and impartial Commission to enquire into their differences^ on the spot and endeavour to effect a settlement.

On assumption that every effort will be made to stop Abdullah carrying out his designs on Khorma valuable breathing time has been gained by this intervention and advantage should be taken to define position and sot up provisional limit to. tne action of both parties. -Assuming any attempt to permanent settlement out of the question during war suggest following arrangement for consideration.

As regards supply of munitions to Bin Saua following^ further explanation is necessary. Arms and ammunition sanctioned in Secretary of State’s telegram March &gt; 20th were sent to Koweit, April 10th from Basra; owing to disturbed state of Koweit they were returned to Basra for safe custody and not handed to Bin Saud’s agent at Koweit till June 16. Philby wrote under date July 16th saying 150 boxes of ammunition sent in 1916 were unfit for use and requested replacement. Tills was sanctioned by G-.H.Q. on July 19th. On July 15th he wrote that number of boxes involved was 250. A further 100 boxes were at once sanctioned by G.H.J. in replacement. Philby added 'The (?1Q00) rifles recently arrived are also subiect to unfavourable criticism. Regret I am not sufficiently expert in matter of arms to pronounce on such criticisms but request either (1), that I be given expert assurance that rifles are for all practical purposes good and serviceable or (2), that an equal number of good and serviceable weapons be issued in exchange preferably Enfield carbines. Comparison of rifles issued by us to (?Sherrif) and by Turks to Ibn Rashid creates dissat isfaction at palming off inferior weapons on Nejd. Regret am personally oartly responsible ^or selection of present rifles but plead lack of expert knowledge. So far as I remember was assured by Ordnance that rifles were serviceable. Matter urgent and beg treatment on generous lines'. The rifles in question were .303 Winchester rifles and were reported quite serviceable by Ordnance.

Addressed to Foreign Office 209 sent to India and time of war and stresses unfavourable' to a final settle- i merit of complicated questions such as exact delimitation Bagdad.PP37 From Political, Baghdad, 8th August 1918. (Addressed Foreign, repeated Secretary of State and High Commissioner Cairo.) (Received 9th, 9 p.m.) (R.) 6490. On 9th July I communicated to Philby for his information, as a matter of routine, the purport of recent reports re activities of Ibn Rashid. nil by replies under date 24th July bv teleffranh from Kowoit follows :— . I hough not explicitly indicated, understand these telegrams are designed to louse Ibn Sand to activity to prevent realisation of any plan (corrupt group) pressure here. Accordingly communicated news as desired and suggested it was time to get a move on. . “ TI|1S morning he sprung on me long written document in which he reviews trend of recent events and adopts attlthd^lhliThls undertaking to act m our interests against Ibn Rashid, &amp;c., was made on understandiim we would protect his interests vis a vis Shereef, Ajman, Koweit, Ac. But recent events have materially altered situation, and not being properly protected by us against enemies besetting him all round, he cannot with due regard to his own interests launch out against Ibn Rashid or accept responsibility for leakage of supplies to enemy unless we give him definite guarantees^ I attach _ much importance to fact that he has put his gne\ances into wilting m reply to my summons to action. On my pointing out that he had not \et carried out his part of bargain for loan received he replied that he was prepared to refund loan rather than risk disaster by leaving his flanks unprotected from Ajman and Shereef. “ He demands following explicit guarantees as preliminary to any further action on his part or acceptance of further responsibility for the blockade namely :— “ 1- British Government to guarantee absolute immunity of his territory and people from any kind of interference “or attack by Shereef. This, of course, comprises the Khorma and Ateba disputed borderland pendino- settlement. l '2. Guarantee be given that Ajman and Shammar elements under our protection should on no account enter his territory for any purpose whatever without his consent. Those not under our protection on no account to be allowed to enter our territory or Koweit. Musabilla to be given friendly elements only on monthly ration system on basis of actual numbers present to prevent leakage to unfriendly elements. 3. So long as blockade of Koweit remains in hands of Ibn SubahK declines all responsibility for leakage to enemy, and suggests either that* blockade be resumed by British or all goods for Kajd be landed at Bahrein or Hasa ports. In either case he accepts full responsibility. “4. That above guarantees being given on our part and hostilities against Ibn Rashid begun on his, we will not let him down by with holding sinews of war as necessary. This means money. Ravin carefully considered this document, came to following conclusions : “(1) Korther incursions of Sherif or Ajman will certainly lead to widespread disturbance, and must be stopped at all costs. “ (2) Maintenance of effective blockade is entirely in our own interests and methods suggested were only possible alternatives. “(3) Above all urgently necessary involve Ibn Sand in hostilities with Ibn Rashid without delay partly to keep his mind from praying on other grievances'arid chiefly to obviate all possibility of his combining with Ibn Rashid to attack Sherif. Latter contingency by no means impossible if we leave him in lurch by refusing to redress grievances and would be extremely popular move among people. “ In these circumstances, and in view unmistakable evidences of increasing estrangement of Ibn Sand, and urgency of obliterating2 unfavourable impression caused by recent events, have taken responsibility of giving written undertaking in following terms, viz. : “ (X) We guarantee him immunity from further attack by Slierii or Ajman and Shammar elements under our protection and to refuse protection and musabilla to hostile elements. “ (2) We will rectify blockade arrangements in some manner acceptable to him, or if unable to do so, will not hold him responsible for leakage of supplies. “(3) We will see that his material resources do not suffer by reason of any hostilities undertaken by him on our behalf. “But I have explicitly stated above undertaking is conditional on his fulfilling his promise to undertake hostilities at once, and on his setting out from Riyadh within ten days from to-day. “ This on his part he undertakes to do. “ I have added that if Government are unwilling or unable to endorse my guarantees or act on them shall not expect him to fulfil his part of bargain. Matter now at critical stage, and everything depends on Governments decision on this and previous telegrams. trust my guarantees will be favourably considered and effectively endorsed without delay. Also that screw may be put upon Dhari and Ajman. As regards ^ money, in view of Turks’ reported generous treatment of Ibn Rashid, and possibility of increased activity by him,, request question of placing liberal funds at my disposal be considered if really vigorous campaign be desired. Refrain from making more detailed proposals in this respect as you already have my considered opinions.” My comments follow.r p- - ' + \ Vrom Political, Baghdad, 7th August 1918. [Addressed Foreign, repeated to Secretary of State for India and High Commissioner, Cairo.) (Received 9th, 2 p.m.) t 1 i (R.) (5489. Phil by reports as follows under date Riyadh 19 th J uly, telegraphed from Koweit 3rd August:— “ In view of recent events venture to submit review of situation during last three months for consideration. On rejoining Ibn Sand last April with Government decision for communication found him greatly disappointed with outcome of negotiations undertaken on our initiative and iirinly convinced result due to machinations of Sherif. My [f instructions (omitted)] were to press him to maintain effective control of Qasim and stop smuggling and exercise real pressure on Shammar. I was also authorised to hold out certain attractive inducements in event of capture of Hail and assure him of final favourable settlement of Ajman question. I also assured him our engagements with Sherif involved nothing prejudicial to his interests and absolute independence in accordance with former agreement. He was pleased with last two items, but said his blockade must depend largely on effective measures by us at Koweit. 1 reassured him on this point. Finally, he declared, owing to cost of keeping his army in the field, and absence of ready money, he could not undertake operations against Shammar. This I regarded as sine qua non conditionally contingent upon mission’s work, and was thus faced with alternative of abandoning work or devising other measures. In former case my conviction, since fully justified by events, was that trouble would occur with Sherif if Ibn Saud (were) left to himself in discontented frame of mind. Therefore chose latter alternative, and, taking advantage of his financial situation, offered him loan of dollars lying idle at Uqair. on condition of action against Shammar. He accepted offer, and offensive was arranged to open beginning of Ramdhan. Meanwhile preparations went ahead with every reasonable hope of success if nothing untoward occurred.” Philby then recounts series of untoward events including Koweit blockade, attack on Khorma by Sherif, and tribal difficulties arising out of conflicting interests of authorities in Koweit, Mesopotamia, and Ibn Saud. He then continues :— H 7 Oivf' I' “ Above events following each other in rapid concession are making my position here increasingly difficult and unenviable. Ibn Saud is beginning to show signs of restlessness and dissatisfaction, suspecting either the bona tides of our policy or the force of my advocacy and representations. General t; public feeling always hostile and sceptical of our intentions is beginning \i seriously to challenge wisdom of Ibn Sand’s alliance and policy, and openly demands vigorous repl.y to action of Sherif and Ajman. Ibn Saud fully realises that break with us would be disastrous to his future, but is in very difficult position. He cannot indefinitely allow me to keep his hands tied while his enemies enjoying .our protection are actually attacking him bo th sides, and what I fear most of all is that public opinion will prove too strong for him to resist. As it is confidence in eA* / our will and power to restrain Sherif [groups omitted-^is shaken and)] he has pledged himself to go to assistance of Khorma if again attacked, and he will do same with Ajman if we (? take no action'. Meanwhile all these complications are seriously delaying operations against Shammar, who take but fourth place in list of enemies to Sherif, Ajman and Koweit. I have given assurances that above matters will engage favourable attention of Government, and nothing but tangible result from such assurances will restore our prestige in Central Arabia which has suffered serious diminution through recent events. I have made specific recom mendations in all cases, and trust they will have urgent consideration. It is for Government to decide relative importance of placating Ibn Saud by abiding by its undertakings or his enemies by permitting them to transgress, but it is my duty to utter warning that whatever scepticism may2 prevail in high quarters regarding Ibn Sand’s military power and- ability to harm our vital interests, no doubts at all should be allowed legal ding the will to war inspiring his subjects. We have now unparalleled opportunity of establishing commanding influence and prestige, both now and heieafter, in Central Arabia by a little firmness in repressing the aggressive tendencies of our Allies and proteges, and Ibn Sand who has stood faithfully by his engagements m spite of promptings from within and aggiession ^from without, will not be blameworthy if the situation gets out of hand. Trust matter may receive serious and sympathetic consideration and request that in future if no objection, I may be consulted before action taken in matters affecting interests of Najd.” j As regards last sentence it will be realised that as every reference to Philby involves at least a month’s delay, it is seldom practicable to consult him on urgent questions that arise daily.
