In their telegram Ko. 6i3-S., dated the 4th llay 1926, the Oovex-nment of India queried the necessity for increasing the strength of the Muscat Levy Corps and I reported in reply that, for financial reasons, an Immediate increase was undesirable. It will be noticed that Captain Kccles has expressed the opinion that the lowest strength for present duties should be 238, while the sanctioned strength since the issue of Colonel Trevor's letter Bo. 16-3., dated the &amp;th January 19S4, has been generally taken to be 218.

I asked Captain Walker to put his ideas down in paper when we could discuss the whole matter with you on your approaching visit* Necessity for policy * 2* Like most Political Officers I have had some experience of Levies, and have been impressed by the neces sity not only of laying down a general policy for a Levy, but of reviewing this policy from time to time to see if any alterations in it, or in the Levy itself, are needed to meet changing circumstances# * Object of the Muscat Levy Corps * 3. The objects of the Muscat Levy Corps were laid down in Political Agent, Muscats, (Mr* Wingate f s), letter of the 30th April to the Civil Commissioner, Baghdad;- (1) To allow of the withdrawal of the Indian Regiment f then stationed here* (2) To make the Sultan^ Government efficient and strong in the eyes of the omanis*2« (3) To provide for the defence of Muscat and Muttra against possible raids from Omani tribesmen. Mr* Wingate added that attacks on the coasts could always be dealt with by one of H.M.Ships» 4, These principles were accepted by Government as forming the raison d^tre of the corps, and I am of opinion that they can be still taken as such# They would appear definitely to rule out any idea of the Corps having garrisons in any other centres except Bait al FalaJ, Muttra and Muscat If garrisons are required elsewhere the Corps must be in creased in numbers or the Sultan must make other arrange- ments» Uor in my opinion could the corps be expected to undertake military expeditions away from Bait al Falaj» If such expeditions are contemplated then the strength of the Corps must be considerably increased. I mention this latter point as in some despatches by Political Agents stress is laid on the necessity of the Corps being mobile (Mr. Wingate himself uses this expression in his letter quoted above )which would seem to indicate some idea in the minds of writers that the Corps might be required to under take such expeditions. Captain Walkerjalso in his letter under reference (para 4) states » if made highly efficient and mobile it could tackle any smaller trouble likely to be met with in the Batineh M » My assumption,however, is that the Corps at its present strength is a purely garri son one for Bait al Falaj to cover Muscat and MUttra from attack by Omani tribes. May I take it that you concur in this assumption? Strength of the Levy . 5. Captain Walker points out that since the Levy was started in 1921 its strength has gradually decreased. Mr. 'WingatS' suggested a maximum of 300 and a minimum of\ - 5 3. 200 men# It now consists of about 150» On the assump tion that the object of the corps is as stated above what is the minimum strength at which it should stand? To answer this question we must aslc another, what would be the strength of an omani raid on Muttra and Muscat which it would have to meet? ' If the raid were made on a very large scale, say 2000 or 3000 men, then of course only a large Levy Corps of perhaps 1000 (the Indian regiment here numbered that) could deal with it* But such a raid is extremely unlikely, and such a large Corps is completely outside the financial capability of the State. Excluding such a raid then, what should be the size of the force? This is not an easy question to answer# T understand that Captain Walker would be satisfied with a minimum of 150 men, which he considers is the very last economical strength. I concur in this. Has it your approval? If so then we must see to it that the strength of the corps remains at that figure coute qui coute. There must no longer be any question of cutting the Cor ps down beyond that point because of financial stringency in the State. The cost of the Levy must be absolutely the first charge on the State treasury, and no matter what other economies have to be made no reduction of the Corps will be per mitted# Composition . 6. In his letter quoted above Mr. Wingate stated that one of the essentials of the Corps was that it should not be Arab. w In other words', he stated, 'what is wanted is a small highly-paid and well-trained and loyal body of cut-throat mercenaries with no ties in the country in which they serve and no love for the Arab. It is no use blinking this fact 11 . Without subscribing to the necessity of the Levies being expert cut-throats, I concur they should be c composed of elements which have no love for the Arab. B r4» The corps is at present entirely composed of Baluohis recruited from various parts of the Sultanas dominion* May I presume that you concur that this composition should continue?- Armament # ?♦ This is a somewhat technical question on which I am not prepared to speak in detail* Captain Walker givet his opinion in his attached letter • The Government of India may possibly make objections to arming the force with the modern short rifle. » On general principles, having regard to the small size of the force - only 150 men - it is obvious that they should be armed as well as possible* Road making and Military training * 8* As Captain Walker explains in para 5 and 6 of his letter the Levy has engaged in a great deal of road mak ing* This work has been carried out at practically no cost to the State and has had an excellent effect - political and general* The fact that there is now a motor road between Muscat, Muttra and Bait al Falaj is of course of « military importance with regard to the role of the Levies as a protection for the first two places^ In other words road making up to date, in addition to other the advantages, has assisted towards/original object of the Further road making (^n excellent thing ift itself) will presumably have to be considered from the same point of view, and if it does not directly conduce towards this object then the question will have to be considered as to whether it interferes too much with military training. This is really a question for the Commandant to decide* Do you concur with the above general principles as regards road making by the Corps?Miscellaneous * 9. In his para 7 Captain Walker makes various suggest tions (a) and (b)» I have dealt with these. (c)*Captain Walker's suggestions seem sound. (d)»Indian officers will 'be dealt with in a separate letter. (e)» This would appear advisable if it can 'be arranged. (f). Forms subject of a separate letter. (g). This account should certainly not be attached to the Levy budget. (h). Provided the necessary minimum of military training be given, see para 8 above&gt; formation of corps into pioneer unit would appear to be a good idea. (i). Increase in transport advisable provided funds could be found. Finance . 10. Captain Walker's budget table explains itself. He suggests that there should be an annual expenditure for 5 years of Rs.154,000 to carry out the programme dealt with in his para 7. I coneur with his suggestion^ but the Financial Adviser will have to be approached. The Levy Corps . 11. I should like to take this opportunity of express ing my opinion of the Corps. The men are cheerful, well turned out , smart in handling their arms and keen on regimental games and sports. The Commandsr-^in-^Chief East Indies who - as you are aware - visited Muscat recently &gt;nsiderably impressed with them. That the Levy can work hard is proved by the road it has made , , The present state of the Corps in fact reflects great credit on Captain Walker and his Indian Officers, who have worked hard and • ~jmtmaHmmmmmmmm * f 46 6» continuously, often under very trying climatic condi tions, to produce this admirable result® c Major, \ Political Agent &amp; H^B^M's consul, Muscat* *Lack of any kind of mechanical aids necessitatea tax ros.d being of the crudest description.

A reduction to 1 00 would pernaps save the state about Rs 240CO per annum but there would be no work done and their'use would not appear to justify their upkeep.

'without this 'being done the Levy might be able to carry on until the crash comes on Rs 142000. # The attaciied table of Budget estimates and ex penditures will show the large retrenchments made.recently, Endeavours to carry out the smallest scheme or re-armament have been waived in response to requests from the treasury.

From the table of actual expenditure forwarded therewith it will be seen that the expenditure has steadily decreated from year to yeer^ while its atrength hes also been reduced from 240 rank and file to the present strength of 149 other ranks* This Viae been necessitated by the imperious deinands of the state treasury, and I share the views of the Political JMsent that the time has now come to consider the future policy to be adopted in respect of the Corps* 3* There is obviously a limit beyond which the Corps cannot be reduced without losing its whole value as a fight ing unit# Aa pointed out in my despatch Ho*81#T of to day's date, so long as the Muscat State expect the British Government •••Government to protect them from outside aggression, so long do I think the British Oovernment is entitled to call upon the State to make a reasonable contribution towards their own defence* 4, the original objects of the Levy Corps are re capitulated in paragraph 3 of the lolitioal agent's ruemo- randum, and I agree generally with them: but I do not agree altogether with the views expressed in paragraph 4 of the memorandum. while the Corps is not large enough to have a garrison in any other centres except Bait al Falaj, Muscat ana Muttra and any such splitting up of the Corps would militate seriously against its efficiency end involve a dispersion of force, I see no reason why it should not undertake expeditions away from its headquarters to deal with minor disturbances. Obviously it cannot deal with serious risings without the support of His Majesty's Government but with lesser dis turbances it should certainly be able to cope. Its employ ment un such occasions would add to the prestige oi the Muscat Government and to the morale of the corps. The Commendant shared my views. 5. % propose therefore to reply to the political Agent, subject to any instructions that I may receive from the Government of Indiat that while the Levy Corps should not be permanently garrisoned out oi Bait al f laj g J sc-e no objection to detachments being sent to deal with minor disturbances in areas where the Muscat writ is effective and that this should be regarded as one of its normal * functions. 6. As regards the strength of the Corps, Captain Walker informs me that any further reduction would, in his opinion,•. \ \\ i 53) -3- opinion, render It entirely ueelese ae a fighting unit and would not be a real econon^y* The overhead charges would regain the same end the loss of the efficiency of the Corps would be disproportionate to the financial saving. In an emergency the Corps could now send a hundred aen away for 2 or 3 weeks to deal with any trouble that arose. I agree there!ore with air the view that the Corps should now be maintained the strength of one British Oificer, 3 Indian officers and 150 rank and file, and J also agree th&amp;t its composition should remain as at present, of Baluchis. here is no ditficulty in obtaining Baluchi recruits since the pay is good* though it must be borne in mind that the service is non-pensionable. Arabs are not willing to enlist and it is desirable to have a force that is nut in sympathy with any Arab element. ff % regards the armament of the Corps, Captain Walker proposes that it should be rearmed with modern short rifles at the rate of 20 to 30 annually and should ©Iso be provided with 2 Vickers and ^ Lewie guns. I presurae the Government of India would hi^ve no objection to this gradual reerming. in view of the smallnees of its numbers it is essenti&amp;l th^t If the Corps is to be of any value it should be provided with modern and up to date arms* The Cosmiandant. has further re commended thet the Corps should be regarded as a pioneer unit. To the oonstruction* of roads throughout Muscat territory X attach much importance. They should add considerably to the influence of the state in the outlying portion© of its territory and should have a valuable civilising and pacifying effect# At the tame time I do not think the military efficiency of the Corps should be altogether sacrificed to roadwsskingi It is a matter in which the balance will have to ...i ' CO r-■:■■■ ■ t® be held evenly between political and military requirements, but in principle I consider thet road-mmking should only be carried out after the military training has been adequate for local requirements. 8. Captain Walker estimates that all the requirements of the Corps could be carried out by an annual expenditure of K««l,54,000/»« I am glad to be able to inform the Government of India that there has been a considerable increase in the customs receipts at ur during the last 2 months and if the increase in the customs tariff is also brought into force the State should be able to afford this comparatively small Increase on its present expenditure. If therefore the (loveHBent of India agree to the proposals outlined, I suggest that the tute should be informed that they are expected to maintain the Corps ect the ab^ve strength and to place at the disposal or the Commandant a sum of Hs.1,54,000/- per annum, for this purpose, no deduction in the strength or expenditure being permissible without previous consultation with the political Agent, vide ay despatch Bo»81*T of today , s date» 9, J have not dealt In this despatch with the question of the Indian officers or of the conditions of service of the Commandant regarding which i will address the (-overnment of India separately. 10 # I am sending a copy of this despatch to Hia Mejesty^s Secretary of State for 7ndia» ATTESTED . r Secretary to the Political esident in the Persian Gulf.

This fe&amp;ling appears to him to be supported by local public opinion# In other words Mr* ^ Hedgcock finds it difficult, if not impossible, to proceed with other economies unless he can first show that some have been effected in the Corps* 3* His other argument is of a more particular nature, gives reasons for his opinion that the pay of the Corps could be reduced (Note, paras 4,5, &amp; 6), and proposes various alternatives towards that end^ (Paras 7 &amp; 8). Captain Walkers proposals * 4. Captain Walker (vide paras 3 &amp; 4 of his letter Ko»4) is strongly against proposals contained in paras 7(a) and (g) and 8(b) of Mr* Hedgcock: i*e. a reduction of 20% in the pay,.a reduction in the number of platoons or disbandment and re-enlistment, 5* On the other hand he - Captain Y/alker - concurs (para 5 of his letter Ho&lt; 5 4), with a reservation as to the effect on the contentment of the Corps (para 6) to an all round cut - excluding the Commandant and Indian Officers - of roughly 16%, with certain more drastic cuts in the non-military personnel of the Corps (vide Appendices A, B, 6 C to his letter)» Mr, Hedgcock in view of the arguments adduced by Captain Walker has agreed to the counter-proposals (vide his letter of 1-2-31)* p' 3 » : Ho decrease in the strength o f tlie Levy ^ 7. It will be noticed, a most important point, that no decrease in the number of the Levies is contemplated, a point I laid stress upon in my letter No.98-C of 24th November 1930 para 5, and with which you concurred, (vide your letter to Government K0.83-T of 27th November 1930 para 6). It is only a decrease in pay which is proposed® This is, however, in itself a serious enough step: a decrease in the pay of armed forces always is 0 The present risks are indicated by Captain Walker in para 6 of his letter, as already noted. I agree with Captain Salter in his opposition to the proposals contained in paras 7(a) and 8(b) of Mr. Hedgcock's lottoy i.e e a cut of 30^ or disbandment. But in view of the very serious financial condition of the State, and of the arguments put forward by Mr. Hedgeock, alluded to in paras 2 and 3 above, I am of opinion that the cuts agreed to by Captain Walker should be put into force. As Captain Walker is strongly in favour of a four platoon organization (para 3 of his letter) I consider that it should be retainedo 8e. It will also be noticed that Mr. Hedgcock is providing funds for the first step towards re-armament of the Corps, which - as Captain Walker points out (vide para 6 of his letter) - has been delayed for some 5 years» Date for the commencement of the out . 9. The date when these cuts, if approved of by Higher Authority, should be put into force remains to be decided. Mr. Hedgcock suggests from 1st of March i^e* as affecting pay for March (para 10 of his Note),, Captain Walker concurs (para 7 of his letter). The latter 1 s proposals regarding opening of the leave season in march and giving 2 weeks extra leave (para 7 ) seem excellent and have my support. It will be noticed that there is not much time to obtain the sanction of Government to the reduction in pay proposed ( on the supposition that Government's sanction\ - 4#. fT J is necessary) before the date (20tn of February) on whicii Captain Walker proposes to issue his warning order. It may be possible, however, to lay the matter briefly before Government by telegram and obtain the necessary sanction in time - that is if you approve of this warning order in particular and of a cut in general. General liemarks * Perhaps a word as to the general aspect ol the pay of the corps may not be out of place. In recommending that the cut should be iriade in the pay I am merely gloving in to the harsh facts of economic necessity, I do not consider that the Levies have been over-paids merely that - as far as one can tell - they have been paid somewhat over market rates. If the State were prosperous, in my opinion it would be distinctly preferable to continue paying the Levies at their present rate. All over the world,however, at this time of financial depression Governments have had to make cuts in the pay of their employees, and taJ£e the risks involved, and Muscat has not been able to escape this unpleasant situation. il&lt; I do not think it is out of place to mention, since it may affect the opinion which may he taJsen of his proposals, that Hr.Hedgcoclc is anxious that it should not be thought that - as a new comer to Muscat - he feas in any way rushed to conclusions, or put for-ard serious proposals without due consideration, or that he is m any way prejudiced against the particular branch of the btate - the levy Corps, which is the subject of this letter. He nas on the contrary himself commanded a levy Corps in Iraq, is in sympathy with the military view point, and is providing funds towards the rearmament of the Corps (para 8 above). i can personally testify to the great trouble he has taken in preparing his case, and to the most reasonable attitude he has adopted in his many conferences with Captain Walker and myself. But as a Financial Adviser to a nearly bankrupt State he has to press for economies wherever he seespossible openings - in fact he would be failing in his duLy were he not to do so» Likewise it has been the duty o1 Captain Walker and myself to consider the question from the Military and Political view respectively, the scheme of reduction of pay now submitted represents I think - a reasonable compi'omise oetween these three points 01 viewj and I trust that it will have your approval. I have the honour to be Sir, Your most obedient servant^ Political Agent 8c H.B.M ! s Consul,Muscat4h£. Ho* S .27/1. Ministry of Finance, ITuscitt, 27th January 1931* My dear Major, Defence Budget. lifter the despatch of your letter to the political Resident concerning the early enhancement of the customs tariff, I 'began to review the 'budget for possible savings* •The first fruits of these investigations is attached in the form of a note on the Defence Budget. T propose sub mitting to you concerning each of the major 'budget heads a similar note outlining the present position and suggested action, in the hope that I may discuss with you the points at issue. The 'biggest individual items in the Budget are:- (1) Civil List Hs.3,10,000 (2) General Administration .. (2) a. Muscat Infantry Other Defence forces, (4) Customs (5 ) Marine As regards (1), Saiyid Said has promised to submit a list of his proposed cut in the allowances paid to the Ruling Family. It is a little long in coming; perhaps he has repented of his decision, or is waiting to see how much his father T s pay is reduced* Probably not until the next financial year will my knowledge of the provinces be sufficient to Justify my proposals for re —organization and retrenchment* j'or the time being, (2) must remain at its present figuie, subject to such reductions as the Council ol Ministers recommend. Prima facie, the rates of pay do not appear high. As regards (4), the cost of collecting Customs is extremely high as compared with other countries. Against 1,35,000 1,40,000 ipprox. 50,000 90,000 35,0002* thie must. bG set tlic foct that th.e rE.te oi 5^ i»j unusually low; ageinst this in turn is the fact th^t Muscat collects at a higher export rate than is customary. But even if the Customs income were doubled the cost of collection would still be high* I have collected a certain amount of data, and hope to take up the question of reducing the cost of collection with the Director of Customs during the coming week. T have also collected data concerning (5); this will be embodied in a note which I hope will be eent to you in the course of the next week. Yours sincerely, 3d/- S.S.Hedgcock. 1Ho. 3*26/1. DEI'T OHCE BIJDG-ET * !)• With outstanding liabilities of Rs.1,35,879 and a 'budget which shows an anticipated deficit of Rs.78,000 on the coming year f s working, the State must make substantial economies in all its services. Accordingly the budget of each branch of the Administration, including that of Defence, has been scrutinized for possible savings# Out of total income of 8|- lakhs, the state spends 1-^- lakhs on the Muscat Infantry, and approximately another ir lekh on other armed forces in the provinces* As the political Resident hsd personally informed me that the numbers of the Muscat Infantry had already been cut down to an irreducible minimum, no economies could be looked for in that direction. Rates of pay and non-military personnel, however, offered hopes of retrenchment; a preliminary review of these items confirmed these hopes# 2)» My first step was to have an informal discussion with Saiyid Said on the question. He said, without hesitation, that he considered the numbers of the Muscat Infantry too large and their pay too high. I % sensed a slight feeling of resentment: the Muscat Infantry seems to be regarded as holding a privileged position vis a vis H.B.M's Government - a position which is thought to preclude the Council of Ministers from making the retrenchments that they consider necessary. When T told Saiyid Said that I would look more fully into the rates of pay, but that I did not propose to effect economies by pressing for a reduction in numbers, he seemed definitely a little disappointed. 3). The Muscat Infantry was first formed in 1921, and was composed of men drawn from Sistan. Their pay was ^-ixed at (i) the war-time rate prevailing in the Sistan Levy, which rate provided for the men finding their own c ame1s\ - 2. (ii) a&gt;i extra monthly allowance to induce the men to leave Sistan for Muscat where they were not called upon to find their own camels. Omanis recruited to replace the Sistanis were paid Rs»10 p.nu less. By May 1922 all the Sistanis had been re patriated and Baluchis - subjects of the Sultan - substituted; but from that date&gt; in spite of changed circumstances, the pay has remained at the rate mentioned above, except for the introduction of G-ood Conduct Fay in 1924. 4 ) * Kates of pay * (a) Apart from the need of economy, other reasons Justifl^ a reduction under this head. The present rate is out of proportion to that offered in other employments in Muscat: that it is attractive is shown by the fact that there is no difficulty in keeping up the strength of the force: further, the purchasing power of the rupee has appreciated during the past year. (b) The pay and allowances received by sepoys and a comparison with other local rates, are shown in the following statement/. Muscat I nfa ntry . pay Rs.30 p.m&lt; G.C.Pay up to maximum of rt 4 H Rations- to the equivalent of ' 5y7o tt Free uniform Free quarters Free medical attendance Two months leave p.a* on full pay* The force is not entitled to a pension: this applies to all other employees in the services of the Muscat State.

Ob , in the Muscat Infantry rises 'by much greater increments than that of the JI.C.Os* in the Indian Army, as the following table shows:- Fuse at Infantry # Indian Army &gt; Pay* G-.C .Pay# Pay, G.C.Fay Sepoy Rs»30 4 16 3 L/lFaik 35 4 18 3 ITaik 40 4 22 6 Havildar 50 15 25 6 In Muscat a Havildar gets Rs.31 p#m» more than a sepoy; in the Indian Army Rs»12 p#m» (d) The proportion of officers and H.G.0s» to men also seems high, namely 4 officers and 40 H.C.Os# to 110 sepoys♦ All H.C.Os. receive pay of rank, the minimum heing Rs.5 p.m. ( 5 ) Hon-Hilitary Personnel . (a) Though there has 'been a reduction in the number of military effectives, the numbers (and in some cases the rate of pay) of the non-military personnel have increased, as will be seen from the following statement Year* Rank &amp; Pile . H o. of non-military person nel 1926 200 25 1930 140 34 Since 1926 there has been a slight decrease in the number of animals on charge, which at present number 4 horses and 4 camels* (b) The non -military personnel is characterized by (i) its numbers being high in comparison with the size of the force. (li) the employment of too many Indians. Apart from the fact that the Indians expect to draw much higher rates of pay, it is desirable on economic grounds to replace foreigners by omanis as far as possible . Indians are engaged because of their better1 bb) 4* workmanship. But unfortunately the State of Oriian cannot afford these admittedly superior 'but more highly paid artisans» (o) The rates of pay of Indian non-military personnel are higher than they appear ^t first sight as rations etc. are provided: also passages to and from India# It should be possible to effect a consider able saving by:- (i) reducing the number of such personnel (ii) replacing Indian by local skilled labour. These measures should not result in the loss of any real efficiency* 6}» It is hoped that the statistical comments made in •4 this note will not be considered as casting any asperson A- on the present efficiency, and excellent work of the corps. The Muscat Infantry fill a very useful role: I can see certain definite advantages to the State in increasing the numbers and efficiency of the force: for this reason no savings in essential services or re-armament are contemplated. The figures recorded above are given to show that rttes oi pay and non-mi-L'ib' yy personnel are virgin forests for the axe o-i economy# 7). In order to place the Muscat Infantry on a rational financial basis the follov/ing measures are cxesiiable (a) A reduction of 30^ in the basic re. ue of pay (b) A reduction in the rate of G.G.Pay (c) / reduction in the number of N.C.Os.: 40 tp 110 men.is too high: 1 H.G.0» to men. (d) A further reduction of the rate of pay of the H..C.Oe. e.g. A Havildar should not receive Rs.31 p.m. more than a sepoy. (e) A reduction in the number of non-military personnel (f) The replacement of expensive foreign skilled labour by local men. (g) A re-organization of the Ifuscat Infantry on a three (or even two) platoon basis as a means of effecting5 • a reduction in the number of IT.C.Os* 8)# The desiderata outlined in the preceding paragraph can 'be achieved 'by:- (a) a gradual reduction of pay rates and progressive re-organization- If this course is adopted, it is considered that an immediate annual saving of Rs»21,000 p.m. should 'be effected, approximately half 'being made ux3 of reduction in pay, and half 'by reduction of the non-military personnel, or ('b) the disbandment of the Levy, and its early enrolment on a different footing (i*e. disbandment as a short cut to re-organization) (b) is the more drastic, but it has certain advantages over (a). It will effect an immediate saving of approxi mately Rs»40,000 p.a. and in a few months time a force as numerous and as efficient (because composed ■ ainly of the seme men) will be available for co-operation with H.B-M's Government in cs.se of need* It will also obviate piecemeal changes and reductions with the attendant friction and discontent. Disbandments have been carried out before, and if proper precaution is ta^en, could be enforced in the case of the Muscat Intantry without ris^c. There may not be again a ti-i^ so suitable for le—organisa tion us the presents ''he impending bankruptcy of the liuscat State would also seem to justify such a step. 9). I should be grateful to have the advice oi ohe G-ulf authorities as to which course of action I should recommend to the Council of Ministers^ If (a) is eventually decided upon, may it be coupled with authority uo make dn immediate annual saving of Hs.21,000? ITearly half of this would be made up 6^16^- % reduction in the rate ox pay oi u le .tank and file* 10). It is important, for various reasons, that a reduction in the pay of the Muscat Infantry should precede cuts in any other branches of the Administration. As monthly expenditure exceeds monthly income, the lower6 rates should come into force as early as possible, certainly not later than the larch pay, which is paid out early in April. In view of his long association with and personal influence over the Corps, the help of Captain Talker in carrying through the difficult task of re trenchment would 'be invaluable. \x scat Sd/- 3.E.Hedgeock Financial Adviser 26th January 1931 !'

With reference to paragraph 7, of your letter, I am to say that, ?diile the Government of India approve of the gradual re-armament of the Corps as State finances permit on the lines suggested, they carcnot agree that it should 'be definitely regarded or classified as a pioneer unit. Re-armament will 'be useless unless the personnel are properly trained to handle their weapons. Even a regular Pioneer Battalion is not equipped with Vickers guns, owing to the difficulty of training the same personnel in technical duties and the handling of complex weapons; and the Muscat Levy Corps, with only one British Officer in its establishment, would be likely to lose in fighting efficiency if equipped and classified as a semi- technical corps.

Hedgcock, ./lio is a capable, hard--orking financier, but I cannot help thinking that his hastiness and - as a consequence - his method of producing his figures and letters piecemeal have not a little, complicated a situation already sufficiently complicated. On the 12th January for instance, Vv. Hedgcock in a review of the financial position of the State estimated the deficit -' on the year's working for i.93^ Rs. 78,000 (vide your letter IT0.99-j of 15th ! arch i93l to ti e Government of India). This was still the position according to rr. Hedgcock on your visit here 15th-x5th February. Only a fortnight later in . ... a ^ .. I p his letter to the Council oi ch ^eL-ruary, xcxv«ai.u.ed uo you U ' (ti ' F under my xett^r . o•56-J of lOth Larch, he estij ates che ^ deficit on the year at Rs.90,000 (para 2). In both instances he allows for two instalments of the G-overnment of India* s loan of Rs.21,750, i.e. a total of Rs.43,500/-. If he was not sure of the first estimate at the time of your visit, it wo.,,.Id have been better for him to have said so, waited until he was sure, and then put u^ a final estimate. 7. Jr. Hedgcock is at times inclined to wander off tie joint9 and to discuss matters ■»«nich i^ave ii mediaue Dealing on the question under consideration - the present financial condition of the utate, and which are per.-.aps somewhat outside his competence as Financial Advisex.

If the cut is not made their hands are tied in making cuts in their other departments,. 9. I do not think that the Council and Mr. Hedgeock are on very strong ground in stuting that they cannot make retrenchments in other departments unless their demands for a cut in the Levy is met in full. Excluding meticulous considerations of percentages, as \.ill be seen from paras 3 -5 above a substantial initial reduction has been maae in j_evy ex^enctiture, ana ox a suiicientlj-- mailed nature be xvc the council a hanale oo ii:a--e u ohex xe ments, if xhey are really in earnest about this.

They may be summarised as follows!- (a) The total Levy budget allotment snouid be i-he average sum spent during the la so t»v o years (i.e. as*132,920) reduced by 16^. This figure includes the reduction already sanctioned by the Council under the advice of the political Hesident, and comes to Rs .ij.l,653« (b) The Commandant may himself decide where the economic are to be effected provided tiiat a further minimum cut of Hs.3/- p.m. on the pay of each sepoy, and pro rata for JT on ••commissioned oixicers, is made. 11. ,/i th reference to (a) the Budget submitted by Captain talker ^para o, and Appendix) com.es to Hs.laljOblj i.e. an excess over the Council*s claim of Rs»9,678. 12. .,ith reference to (b) the cut in tae sepoys pay has been Hs.2/~, so another Rs.3/- cut - ould have to beI k comparison 'between the pay of the Muscat Infantry and that of the Customs Department. The rawest recruit in the Muscat Infantry receives the equivalent of nearly Es. 40/- p.m,, as compared with the Is. 10 netj or less, received 'by an askari who has served the Sultan for perhaps twenty years. As the askaris^of whom there ar-fc^ ahout 300, are not a trained or disciplined force, It may 'be fairer to compare the Levy with the Customs depart- nent, which is the next 'best-paid 'branch of the administration. The percentage of literacy is of course much higher in the latter, 'bnt in addidtion to being literate about one-third of the Gustoms staff (controlling nineteen ports) must also have a knowledge of accountancy. The numbers of the Muscat Infantry are made up of 152 military effectives and 34 non- military personnel; the British Commandant, costing the State 19,700 p.a,, is excluded, and is also the Egyptian Director of Customs on Fs. 10,500 p.m. Department No, of persons Gost per annum Oost per man M o I 0 186 Es, 1,02,000 Rs. 548 Oust cms 169 ' - 3,0 ' j 0 44 o The figure of Ps« 1,02,000 is made up of pay, rations and clothing (PSo3000) only; housing,lighting, equipment, leave passages and medical attendance are not included.Statement sho inf fallinr off in revenue collections Jan.l 19; 1 to March 21st 19' 1. from Decrease in revenue collections fet* 1/1/61 to iil/l/Zl as compared with same period last year » 19,000 At this rate the decrease in collections for 19ol -rill 'be ! &lt;, 1 ,16 ,000 , as comparea with the collection for 1950, '■hich in were F ,97,000 less than' % ! 1 Muscat, 27/3/31 ihltl I S The enclosed precis was written priaarily for my office records and the P.A.'s information.

After discussions with the P.A., a compromise budget of Rs 1,20,854 was agreed to by P,A, Council of Ministers, P«A # , and Commandant, the last-named making a reservation that a cut in pay might cause discontent. This total represented an 8^ reduction on last year's expenditure, but made a much larger provision for re-armament. The Levy budget was the first and most important step in a S montMLy retren0i:lment schsme ' *^0^ *ould have at once reduced ^expenditure to the level of monthly Income. The . »&lt;■■ crux of this budget was a 16* J* reduction In the pay of t '' ^ 'iie. (, If rations, clothing etc. are taken into account, the reduction on a sepoy's total emoluments worlcs out at approx. .12^.) The lead thus set by the Levy' would enable proportionate reductions to be made In the other much lower-paid departments. On his visit of February 33th to isth. the Political6o the full realisation of their scheme of retrenciiLiervt a further cut of Rs 3 p.m. in the pay of each sepoy^, of N.C.O.s prorata, was a aine c.ua noru This 'brines the total cut in the pay of the rank and file up to the 12^fo men tioned in para 4 above. Such a reductiom of 16% in the 'budget will in no way impair the military efficiency of the force. Further, the Council considered that the State 1 s heavy dehts and its anticipated deficit of Rs 90,000 fully justified any risk there might be in cutting down the pay of armed men. Alternatively, they were willing, if the Government of India preferred it, to reduce the numbers of the Levy. (No S &amp;£ 12 /3 of March 3rd,) For the State of Muscat to contribute one-sixth of its total income dforthe maintenance of the small Levy farce seems to me to be a drain on the country's impoverished exchequer out of all proportion to the value to the Indian Army of 150 men in the event of Muscat's being attached in force. Nevertheless, in all my discussions with the Council I have met with no hint that they wish to abolish the Muscat Infantry, or to evade the respons ibility of defending their own country. They are prepared to provide the Levy witi, funds up to the maximum of athe State's resources, but now that Muscat is on the vej^e of bankruptcy they do expect that the Levy should be run with reasonable economy»Telegram: R ftoux To Political Resident,Karachi Political Agentj Muscat ITo, T # 49 Dated; 4th April 1931, I agree with, views expressed in your 83-G of 25th March.

It is however desirable to give the Council a reasoned reply to their re uests, but it is impossible for me to do so on the fragmentary figures that have been supplied to me piece-meal hitherto, and some of the items I am quite at a loss to understand. iVould you therefore kindly ask Hedgcock to let you have a revised budget, sho ing receipts and expenditure under major heads. In this budget the following economies should, of course, be taken into account; (a) reduction in the Sultans pay (b) reduction in Levy budget (c) reduction in ruling family allowances and other departments, if any. /nd account should also be taken of increased income that may be expected from (a)Sohar; (b)Sur and (c) increase in the customs tariff, | I which it may be assumed will be sanctioned in || the next two or three months.

Hedgcock wanted a cut of Rs.21,000 bringing it down to about He.1,20,000. I agree^to a cut of R8#12 &gt; 000, reducing it to Rs.1,28,000. Walker has now produced a budget of Hs.1,21,331 and yet according to Hedg- cock he has only effected a saving of Rs#ll,000, and Hedgcock is demanding a further saving of Rs.10,000, bring ing the budget to Rs»l,11,000. talker seems to me to be on very strong ground in the statement in paragraph 13 of your memorandum No»83-C of the 2oth Starch 1931, in which he states that he has actually cut down the budget to the figure originally demanded hy Hedgcock, although he has onl^- effected a saving of Rs.11,000, but according to the above figures, he has actually effected a saving of about Rs.20,000.

Strength and State on arrival * On taking over the Corps from Captain r.g. ctephenE in Kay 1928 the strength of the Corps was approximately one B.O, and 3 I. Os. and 180 other ranks with 36 followers. Captain 'tephene had brought the corps to a very satisfactory state of discipline end smartness. Organisat ion . The Levy hes 'been maintained on a four platoon basis as being the most suitable for its strength. 1 ersonnel . The Jndicn Officers with the unit on mailing over ooneiBted of Jubedar Major Fatteh Khon, (dafladrr 28th Light Cavalry, now 7th Cavtlry) Suhedar Fatteh Khan, (daffadcr 20th Lancers) and Jemtdar adjutant Mohamad Ibrahim (late .&gt; . • Baluch Regt.). These Officers have continued to serve with the Levy during my comraond and have rendcrea excellent service the whole tirne. Armarr.e nt . This item has been a source of anxiety to each Conimsndant in turn. The Corps is armed with two Maxim guns of very doubtful efficiency, one new Lewis gun. 4u modern S.K.L.ii.rifles ana the remainder old. non charger loading magazine Lee Infields firing a.VI.axr ^nition some of it i qi p The su :Bly oi this i^ about dating bsck es lor as ISl-i- lne BU ^ J ■ j f -rr t,- h suDoly cannot be obtains^ 600 rounds per rifle and a Irebn sup^jr in emergency nearer than India. It is hoped this year to improve on this state of affairs by replacing the ^.VI. rifles with a certain number of short rifles thereby increaeing the S.A.A. reserve for the remainder. Lac. of funds has precluded more than the absolute minimum sum beingallotted to this most important item. The situation is rendered still raore uneatisfactory by the exclusion of an armourer from the Levy eetablishment. He is to be replaced by bxi fully qualified armourer maintained by the State to look after the weapons of sll the armed forces of the State, but this individual has not yet materialized. The Corps has nov* been without an armourer for nix months and it is with difficulty that rifles fit to fire can be found for the present very small strength. Present Strength . The present strength is 1 British Officer, 3 Indian Officers and 150 other rabks. This is the minimum strength at which the Corps can function. Actually during the leave season a few men are allowed to cut their names as it makes no difference to the strength at .Muscat, the leave men in Gwadur and Mekran being unavailable for rapid recall. This year the British Officer is not taking over for some four months from the date of departure of the present Commandant. -his is gin emergent measure owing to the financial situation. he Council, however, l?ay particular stress on the necessity oi a British Officer as permanent Commandant. Clothing and i.quipmt nt . The clothing of the unit remains the same as when I took over. Web equipment is not now used except on i it Id twining or on expeditions. Leather belts and pouches are ueed for guards end ordinary parades, thus saving wecr sna tear of the web equipment. The uniform is smart and service able as well as being very cheap. Boots have been entirely discarded in favour of chaplis which are more suited to the ., +r , _ i foot-wear of the troops. Uniform country and are the natural loot is all made up by the regimental tailor. Health and ^nitation. In the cold weather of 1929-30 there was abnormally3 US hU- heavy rainfall# The linetj were incapable of standing up to this and eoon became a morass# On one occasion their corjdition was eo extremely miserable that they had to be abandoned and the troops sheltered in the inner verandahs of Bet -al -i-alaj itself. Detachments were working on the road to Boshar &amp;nd their condition was also a eodden one as they were sheltered in H dan rt huts, totally incapable of Keeping out the rain. All this caused a fairly high percentage of Malaria and there werf, unfortunately , several deaths from l-neumonia. ince then, the substitution of tents for the fl dan H huts has made the lot of outside detachments better than that of men left in the lines. The issue of excellent thick woollen jerseys has also given the troops some protection against chill. Greatcoats are only available for guards and sentries. On the whole trie general health has been excellent with the exception 01 thi ^ period. Public orks . As far as the lines are concerned the most- important work done hue been the opening the folaj from ite eource in the tank into r properly built waterway, ireviouely it ran underground under the hut used as a ioda ster factory tnu the mosque. This channel wee the breeding place of thousands of moequitos. A very noticeable improvement can be seen me the result of thie work. The linee themeelvee replBBtered *itn the local adheeive green mud before the heavy rainfall elreedy referred to, thereby undoubtedly saving them from utter collapse. One barrack, the regimental workshop, did tell down. Had it been a platoon barraok there would have been heavy casualties. Under this heading might be olaesed the Levy's 'magnum opus', the road connecting Muscat with atrah on account of its construction has been written elsewhere. Transport . The camels which formerly mace up the levy 's transport have been replaced by a Morris Commercial 25 owt lorry.&gt; Thie lo »ry has done yeoman service since its receipt 18 months ago and under the severest conditions. Leave &gt; Leave has I blqw been standardised at two months irrespective of whether the leave is grrnted in Muscat or Gwedur or ekran, This ellows for the change over of platoons ^nd allows the individual training of the men, carried out in the leave season to be done with their own platoons. Terms of ■ erice . Term of service is for four years as introduced by Geptein hccles. The British Officer is normally seconded from the Indi&lt;n ■rmy for two years. Training and disc ipline. During the construction of the ■ UEcat- atrah road, militray training had perforce to be somewhat subordinated to the work in hand. Ag the construction of thie road, however has a distinct bearing on the defence of the whole locality, its conetruction was not without military value. ihe men soon proved themselves expert fjnd willing workers at this form of labour. They show an equal keenness in 1 leld training and I consider that a few periods of iniBixxi® intensive training in camp would soon bring them up to a very satisfac tory standard of training. Discipline has been well maintained J-or this the unfailing vigilance and tact of the Indian Officers is largely responsible. ♦ 4 • ^ &lt; ports * The men are keen on hock'y .nd sports. The Levy's chief opponents are the sloops of the Persian Gulf Division a.K. These games are always fought out in the very best spirit. Annual sports are held at which considerable enthusiasm is shown. This last year the sports were rendered much more interesting by the participation of 'Cyclamen' in them.\\'1 Honours were fairly evenly divided, /n immense crowd turned up from uscat and Matrah to watch them. Before sailing the 'Cyclamen' took all the available N.C.Oa. on board and gave them a demonBtration of a sailors duties under war conditions et sea. This courtesy vsas very highly appreciated by the £• C • 0 s. General nemarks . In conclust ion I wish to thank H .H. the Sultan of Muscat and His Council of i nistere for their unfailing courtesy end help in many matters. To Major Murphy and Major Fowle thanks are also due for the keen interest they have shown end the help they hu-ve rendered in looking after the interests of the Levy in its relations with the Govermuent of India and the Council. Finally I wish to bring to notice the excellent services rendered during my tour of duty by fcubedar Major Fatteh Khan end Jemadar Mohammad Ibrahim. The latter has, six for some/months officiated as Regtl. clerk in addition to his other duties in a most eilicient manner. Captain, Coniiaandant Muscat Levy Corps# ! u scat, 2nd May 1931.
