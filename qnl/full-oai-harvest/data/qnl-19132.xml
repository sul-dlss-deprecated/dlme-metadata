It contains 129 named individuals (in Arabic and English) of the Āl Khalīfah (al-‘Utūb) family of Bahrain, senior branch descended from Salmān. This branch produced all the Shaikhs of Bahrain except one. Some of these individuals appear with birth and death dates, as well as brief biographical information.There is also a 'Chronological list of Shaikhs of Bahrain belonging to this family' with the periods of their reign, including: Khalīfah-bin-Muhammad [Khalīfah bin Muḥammad], Ahmad-bin-Khalīfah [Aḥmad bin Khalīfah], Salmān-bin-Ahmad [Salmān bin Aḥmad], ’Abdullah-bin-Ahmad [‘Abdullāh bin Aḥmad], Khalīfah bin Salmān [Khalīfah bin Salmān], Muhammad bin-Khalīfah [Muḥammad bin Khalīfah], ’Ali-bin-Khalīfah [‘Alī bin Khalīfah], and ’Isa-bin-’Ali [‘Īsá bin ‘Alī]. There is also a diagram that explains the connection of 'Sheet No. 1' with 'Sheet Nos. 2 and 3' (folios 12A and 12B).In addition, a section of 'Notes' is included that gives 1907 as the year of compilation, as well as other details concerning the arrangement of the table, including: the completeness of the table; the omission of distant collateral relatives and all females; 'issue' means 'male issue'; the ordering of children from the same father according to seniority from left to right; dates of birth, and in some cases death, are approximate only; and when the fact or date of death is not mentioned the person was probably alive in 1906.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival item</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023876399.0x000010#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
