Further discussion by officials in the India Office, Government of India and British officials in the Gulf concerns whether shortcomings in Thomas's administrative work would allow the India Office to support such an award. The correspondence includes a letter (ff 641-643) from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf listing Thomas's 'delinquencies' during his time as an administrator in the employ of the Sultan of Muscat and Oman.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Bertram Sidney Thomas</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>Decorations of honour</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000466.0x000140#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
