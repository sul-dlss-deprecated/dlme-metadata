Sir, With reference to letter Ho. 3868 E.B., dated 17th October 1905 from the Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department to your address and subsequent correspondence, I have the honour to submx„ the following report in connection with the settlement of the French Flag question according to the «.rbitra tion award. 2 , Monsieur Laronce and I held our first two conferences on the 2nd and 6th instant. On the first occasion we confined our attention to discussing the terms of the award themselves, and the points ux^on which we differed were submitted by me to the Govern ment of India on the following day in a telegram of Monsieur Laronce agreed which a copy was sent to you.Cs agreed to the suggestion that a x^ro^lamation announcing the result of the arbitration should be issued by His Highness the Sultan, and we will forward in due course to our respective Governments a draft for approval. The proclamation should in my opinion explain the terms of the award in order that the Omanis concerned may know definitely the extent of their privileges in future; hence, from one point of view, the desirability of accord in regard to interpretation, 3. In our second conference the persons who were henceforth to fly French Flags were discussed. First i Monsieur Laronce informed me that o n 15th May 1904 a n agreement was signed between London a nd Paris in regard to the recognition by His Majesty’s Government of protection being afforded by France to 25 Arabs of Zanzibar, and gave me a list of six oi these who, he said, are in the habit of visiting Oman, and must be considered as proteges of France in this neighbourhood as they are in Zanzibar. I attach a memorandum in connection with these individuals, and it is interest ing to note that Monsieur Ottavi, who is at preoeriv French Consul at Zanzibar and presumably is responsible for the compilation of this list of 25 names, was from 1894 to 1901 representative of his Government at Muscat and must be aware that four of these six persons are subjectssubjects of the Sultan of Oman 4. Monsieur Laronce then produced the list of flagholders placed by his Government before the Hague Tribunal with their counter case. He informed me that all the owners of dhows included therein were believed (A to have received their authorisation to fly the flag in the first instance from one of the French colonies between 186 3 and 1892; and that enquiries were being made of which &amp;e hoped before long to furnish me with the result/. From local reports it would appear that several had obtained their papers first from Monsieur Ottavi in Muscat, but the position is a difficult one as no doubt the French would produce documentary evidence from their colonial registers if required to do so. This matter I hope to go into more fully when my colleague furnishes me with the dates and records in connection with this list. Our negociations are now delayed pending an agreement being arrived at upon the points concerning the interpretation of the terms of the award referred by me in my telegram of the 3rd Instant, and ohe receipt by Monsieur Laronce of further information in connection with the list of French flagholders.G A coi;&gt;y of this report has been forwarded to the Government of India in the Foreign Department.

The French Consul agrees with me that the Proclamation should be issued by the Sultan, but before we can frame it the following points, in regard to which we are not in accord, should be decided. First . French hold that the authorization to fly their flag is granted to an owner for all dhows he possesses, founding this view principally upon the wording of Clause 2 of the Award and the fact that the Brussels Act was not signed before the authorised persons received authorization, oecond♦ Status of dhows while at anchor in Oman ports. I contend tnat a dhow should cease to be inviolable with the dropping of the Anchor. Third. In cases of quarrel between the master and the crew or among the crew while at sea. French Consul holdsthat such a matter should be referred to him for settlement after the return of the vessel, I maintain that this would be withdrawal from the Sultan T s jurisdiction.

The object of French is to save their face locally as far as possible, French Consul admits that in all cases the authorisation disappears with death of holders so that in time all will die out in any case. Under these circumstances could we not obtain quid pro quo for allowing the authorisation to be considered as they wish ? The French might be prepared to recognise British Protectorate, their interests in this country being finally settled1 ^ 2.3 In any further communica tion on this subject, please quote *»■ -]W and address— The Under-Secretary of State, 1'oreign Office, London.

From— Major W. G. Grey, Officiating Political Agent and His Britannic Majesty's Consul at Maskat, To—The Political Besident in the Persian Gulf. With reference to the memorandum communicated by the Foreign Office to Mons. Geoff ray, a copy of which was forwarded to you hy the Assistant Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department with his endorsement No. 3933 E.-B., dated 23rd October 1905, I have the honour to report as follows. 2. On the 7th instant, the French Consul informed me that he had received instructions from his Government to announce to His Highness the Sultan that, in accordance with clause six of the Hague Arbitration award, those subjects of His Highness who are authorised to fly French flags are not, in future, to be considered as having been removed, in consequence of that fact, from his sovereignty and jurisdiction. Mons. Laronce suggested that he should wait until the end of the fasting month of Bamzan before taking action, but I replied that in my opinion it would be better to save further delay by making the announcement at once. On the 10th instant, I received from my colleague the letter which forms enclosure (1) to this report, and which I briefly acknowledged on receipt. 3. On the morning of the 11th instant, I paid a visit to the Sultan. His a j * i o a . Highness showed me an Arabic transla- “ Protocole IV. Seance du mardi le 3 Aout . &amp; „ . , . ^ 1905” (enclosure in Foreign Office letter of 11th tlOU of the document noted in the margin, August 1905 ). which he had received from the French Consul the previous day with enclosure (2), and asked me to compare it with the original. I did so, and found two serious mistakes in the translation, which it appeared necessary to correct without delay. I therefore wrote to Mons. Laronce the letter attached (enclosure 3), and sent him the translation. Within an hour, I received his reply (enclosure 4) with the translation corrected in accordance with my suggestions. I then returned the document to His High ness. 4. The French translation of the Arabic passage quoted in my letter to Mons. Laronce is as follows “ Considerant que les dispositions de Particle 4 du Traite Franco-Mascatais de 1844 s’appliquent aux personnes qui demandent des titres de navires dans le but d’exercer quelque commerce ”. The gravity of this mistake is at once apparent; a considerable portion of the paragraph has been omitted in copying. With regard to the second error, the meaning of here is f&lt; in this connection , which expression raises an obvious doubt in the mind of the reader. It should he “ on this account ”, or preferably as recommended by me to Mons. Laronce.2 5. I observed that this mistake occurs also in the French Consul’s letter to the Sultan (enclosure 2), and that the wording of the letter tended to disturb his feelings in regard to the interpretation of the terms of clause 6 of the award. After much consideration, I was driven to the conclusion that the letter in the form in which it was sent to His Highness could not have emanated either from the French Government or from Mons. Laronce, and on the morning of the 14th instant took the Sultan’s copy to the French Consulate, and asked my colleague whether it was a correct translation of its French original. He appeared to be surprised at my question, but at once produced the^French version, and we found, as I expected, that it had been mistranslated. Mons. Laronce suggested that he should call his Arab Dragoman, Abd-ul-Aziz- ur-Hawahi, and that we should make a translation together. I readily agreedT ; and the result was another Arabic letter [of which enclosure (5) is an English translation], which was duly sent to the Sultan by my colleague, in lieu of that first addressed to him. A translation of His Highness’s reply is also attached, enclosure (6). 6. Mons. Laronce informed me that the translation of the “ Protocole ” above referred to was made in Paris and not locally, and I believe the second mistake in the Sultan’s copy thereof, which was in the original, to be due to a clerical error very easily made, namely, the substitution of the word O for . Beyond this the translation is very good. ( The error in copying, however, and the mistranslation of the letter to His Highness the Sultan are the work of Abd-ul-Aziz, and it is not easy to believe that they were unintentional Mons. Laronce announ -ed to me his intention to reprimand the Dragoman for his carelessness, and apologised himself for not having read the documents more attentively before despatching them ; he, moreover, suggested that, in case of any further difficulty of this nature, I should act as I had done on the present occasion. 7. A copy of this letter and its enclosures will be forwarded to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. From—The French Consul at Maskat, To—His Britannic Majesty's Consul at Maskat. Comme suite a la communication verbale que je vous ai faite recemment selon les instructions de mon Gouvernement et conformement a la sentence rendue par la cour arbitrale de La Haye, le 8 aout dernier, dans I’affaire des boutriers Mascatais, j’ai 1’honneur de vous informer que, dans la pensee du Gouyernement de la Bepublique, la delivrance de papiers de navigation provisoire aux boutres fran^ses ne pourra 6tre, en aucun cas, un obstacle a 1’application complete et eventuelle de la sentence arbitrale, et que de plus, en vertu de la derni&amp;re clause de la dite sentence, je fais, en date de ce jour] la remise au Sultan des sujets Mascatais vises par Particle en question et qui seront consideres a 1 avenir comme soumis a sa souverainite et a sa juridiction.

So the hope of my Government is that, when I send such a person to your Court, that person should be treated with justice and equity always, whenever he comes to your Court, and that such persons should enjoy special consideration and just dealing on account of the French flag, so that no tyranny, or oppression, or retaliation should come upon them. The persons coming under this category must be Your Highness’ subjects born in Oman only ; as regards Arabs who can prove French title or (themselves to be) French subjects, they will always remain under the protection of the French Consul at Maskat.

Je ne veux pas vous deranger par une lettre officielle, mais le Sultan m’a montre ce matin la traduction gi-jointe de la sentence de la Haye que vous lui aviez en-oyee.

Dans la version francaise se trouve cette sentence : — “ Considerant que les dispositions de Particle 4 du Traite Franco-Mascatais de 1844 s’appliquent seulement aux personnes qui sont bona fide au service des Frangais, mais pas aux personnes qui demandent des titres de navires dans le but d’exercer quelque commerce : ” et puis on Pa traduite :— La traduction donne un sens tout a fait different a celui de Poriginal. 2.

Merci, et bien a vous. V Translation of an official letter from the French Consul to the Sultan, dated the 10th November 1905, in lieu of that previously sent. After compliments —I have, the honour to send to Your Highness, with this letter, all the papers relating to the sentence pronounced by the Hague Arbitration Tribunal on the 8th August last, in connection with Maskatdhows. The Government of the French Republic intend fully to carry out that sentence, and hope that the statement thereof is (clear) enough to enable the difficulty to be unravelled according to the settlement. My High Gov ernment has given me permission to explain to Your Highness that, according to the last clause of the said sentence, she will regard from to-day that those of your subjects who are the owners or masters of dhows authorised to fly French flags, or who are members of the crews of such vessels, or who belong to their families, do not possess any right of ex-territoriality on tlusL. account, and are not exempt from Your Highness’ sovereignty and jurisdiction. In returning these persons to Your Highness’s jurisdiction, the Government of the Republic hopes that they will be treated with justice and equity when they appear in your Court, and that hoisting the French flag will not be a reason for oppression or retaliation to come upon them. The persons coming under this category must be Your Highness’ subjects born in Oman only; as regards Arabs, who can prove French title* or (themselves to be) French subjects, they will always remain under the protection of the French Consul at Maskat. This is what had to be explained. May you be guarded and salaam! YI Translation of the Sultan’s reply to the French Consul, dated the 16th November 1905. After compliments .—I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter, dated 10th November, in which you inform me that those of my subjects who are allowed, according to the judgment of the Hague Tribunal, to fly the t rench flag, are not from this time to be exempt from my sovereignty, and especially from my jurisdiction, in accordance with the 6th clause of that judgment. I thank your honour for this (notice), and assure you that, when any one of such persons appears in my Court, he will be treated with the same justice and equity as my subjects generally, and that the hoisting of the French flag by the persons referred to will meet with no objection from me, provided that it is hoisted in circumstances allowed by the judgment of the Hague Arbitration Court, and salaam. * This is explained by Mons. Laronce to mean “naturalised Frenchmen,’’ neither proteges nor French subjects.

Personally, I do not think this of much importance as when Monsieur Laronce arrives ana matters are settled, persons concerned, if not entitled, will have to give them up. At /&lt; the same time, there appears to be a breach of the status quo involved, Hnds. My point was, that the dhows concerned having set out with their renouvellements for their annual voyages cannot ordinarily be dealt with again until their return just before or just after next south-west monsoon.5 From ^ ecr Gtary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, To Major ?. z. oox f C.I.F., Offg» Political itesident in the Persian Gulf, k U 8 h i r e.

Laronoe to endeavoiir to arrive at an understanding on all points of doubtful interpretation and also on the terms of the public notification to be issued by the Sultan. When necessary, reference can be made to the of the steps to be taken to carry out the Maskat Arbitration Award. 2 . The Government of India agree with you that it may first step should, in the opinion of the Government of India GovernmentGovernment of India for guidance. 3. The Government of India hardly see their way, with the present data before them, to expressing any opinion on your proposal that the Tfrenoh Flag shall not he flown in the oreek which divides the two settlements of sur. The right to fly the French Flag will presumably continue to he the same in all parts of the territorial waters of Maskat and it is unlikely that the French Government who have already teen deprived of a substantial portion of the rights claimed by them, would consent to a further diminution of these without a quid pro quo. I am to suggest that you should furnish a full account of the special circumstances which, in your opinion, would justify the raising of this question; the advantages which are likely to accrue to the Sultan from the adoption of your suggestion and the likelihood which there is of its being agreed to by Hons. Laronoe. 4. The Government of India propose to await your final recommendations before considering the question of appointing a Lritish officer at Sur. An essential element in the situa tion will be the probability of suoh a step being followed by similar action on the part of the French; it would there fore be of assistance if you could state in due course your opinion not only on this point, but also as to whether a regime under which a British and a French' Vice Oonsxil might ► a I i!“bo stationed at 3ur f would “be preferable to one involving no foreign representative at that port. I have the honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient servant. Sd/- S. M. Fraser. Sooretary to the Government of India.No. 454, dated Bushire, the 17th (received 26th) September 1905. From— MAJOR P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Offg. Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To— S. M. Fraser, Esq., C.I.E., Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. In Foreign Department telegram No. 3118-E. A., dated 14th August, I was directed to submit my views with regard to the Maskat Arbitration Award after consultation with the Political Agent, Maskat. Jn my telegram of 24th August, I asked permission to delay my final reply pending receipt of the printed copies of the complete proceedings and their accompanying despatches. These documents have now reached me under Foreign Department endorse ments marginally noted ; and I have the honour to submit my views as directed. No. 3323-E.B,, dated 31st August 1905. No. 3395-E.B., dated 6th September 1905. Meanwhile the Government of India have received Major Grey’s letter Nos* 407 and 4fo and copies of the memoranda of his views and their accompanimentsi which he subsequently forwarded to me. 2. The full text of the preamble to the actual terms of the Award presents the latter in a much more favourable light than did the first telegraphic summa ries, and at all events places it beyond doubt that the Sultan’s position is consi derably benefited by the result of the Arbitration; and that neither His Highness nor we have any reason to regret having committed the issue to the Tribunal. Apart from the last item of the Award which is of course most important, there are three points in the preamble to the Award which seem to me especially satisfactory— (1) That the Court have decided that France is bound, in the grant of her Flag, by the provisions of the Brussels Act, especially Article 32 . (2) That they have decided that it is undeniable that the practice pursued by the French, facilitates traffic in slaves. (3) That they have given the French Government a very strong hint that they are morally unjustified in persisting in their reservation of Article 42 of the Brussels Act. 3. Were th« present Ruler a stronger character and his administration more effective and civilised, and could we hope with any confidence that French Consuls and the French Colonial Party would be proof against temptation to cir cumvent them, then the terms of the Award would be all that we could reason ably want and the privilege of inviolability in Maskat waters with which the pro tected vessels have been endowed, would have been a consideration of minor im portance. As things are however the decision of the Tribunal on this point will, I be lieve, affect the results a good deal, and what past experience teaches me to fear is that as long as there are ten or a dozen flag-holders who can sail into Maskat Harbour, or cut defiantly across the bows of the “ Nur-el-Bahr ” at sea, under the French Flag, they will still ignore the Sultan, at Maskat, and will form a dis turbing leaven among the population at Sur. His Highness Seyyid Feisal is so prone to let things drift for the sake of a quiet life, that unless we are constantly vigilant in helping him to maintain his authority and improve his administration at Sur, it is possible that he may, in spite of the terms of the Award, continue to allow the French Flag element to defy his local representatives and defraud him of his Customs revenues, sooner than have unpleasant half-hours with Consuls or Naval Commanders of the French Government. It remains to be seen what steps we can devise to prevent such a contingency.4 - A great deal of course depends on the number of proteges who survive the investigation of their claims to protection. In this connection Mr. Ronald Graham estimates 10 or 12. Major Grey thinks only 2, but judging from the list of names and approximate dates which he furnishes, there will be a good many more than that, who have received papers between 1863 and 1892. This can only be ascertained by thorough investiga tion, and the dates cannot be stated authoritatively pending Monsieur Laronce's return. 5. Then there are two points which I think might have been settled more explicitly in the Award, (a) As to whether there is any inheritable right to carry the Flag. (I gather from the terms of lines 9 and 10 from the bottom of pa^e 6 of the Award that there is not). &amp; {b) As to the manner in which the claims are to be investigated. Definite instructions on the latter point would have eliminated a fruitful source of difficulty. Thus, clause 3 of the first part of the Actual Award provides that the title to fly the Flag is conditional on the applicant being able to establish that he had been treated as a protege before 1863,— But establish before whom? 6. Lastly with regard to measures to tive — be taken to make the Award effec- (a) Major Grey writes that the Sultan is averse to the issue of a procla mation at Sur; but I think this hesitation is only due to the fact that the Sultan had not then seen the complete Award and did not fully understand it. 1 quite agree however that any notification would be premature unt. the titles of all the claimants have been investigated and decided. Once that is done, I am of opinion that the issue of a written not'fication exp ailing the Award is indispensable, and that it should not be left to the ignorant mercies of the Wali of Sur a very humble person at present. ’ If this course is not taken, the French Dragoman will be in a position to misrepresent the terms of the Award to the Suris to any extent, and keep alive their disaffection. What I fear is that owing to Monsieur Laronce’s delay, all the r rench Dhows and their sea-going owners will have left Sur and be absent for the next six months. If that proves to be the case I think the broad terms of the Award should be provisionally made havrbeen v^ed!' rePeated m ^ detai ‘ later when the clai ™ The notification might be issued by the Sultan in consultation with and with the concurrence of” the Consuls of England and France and should specify the names of those persons entitled and those not entitled to fly the Flag on their Dhows. It should also contain the threat suggested by Major Grey that the use of the Flag by unauthorised persons or Dhows would be punished with the utmost rigour. ( 4 ) On Monsieur Laronce’s return he will no doubt enter into communica- tion with the Sultan or Major Grey. The first thing to be done is to see how many persons on the list the h rench are prepared to eliminate forthwith. The titles of the remainder should then be thoroughly investigated, and any case with regard to which the Consuls and the Sultan cannot come to an agreement, should be referred to London andbe in- (n) Next, a draft notification for the Sultan to issue should drawn up and approved by both Governments. It should elude a list of approved proteges. (m) Any doubtful points coming to light during the above negoti ations, such as the question of inheritable title, should be re- terred to London and Paris and authoritatively settled. It is presumed that any person found flying the French Flacr unlawfully or running contraband under it, will be punished by the bultan, if caught in Maskat waters. (iv) consid^OoTofGovernmem- 61 tW ° SUggestbns for the consideration or re- (0 That it should be decided between us that the creek which divides ^e two setUements of Sur, and which at high-water makes the Mugraimatem half almost an island, is within the territorial limits of Sur Town, and the French Flag shall not be flown there. If this is not done, cases of so-called violation of the flag during the tribal quarrels of the inhabitants will be likely to recur. (n) That when we see what the result of the Award amounts to, after set- tlement of titles and points of disputes, the question of the des patch of a Vice-Consul or Consular Agent to Sur after a con venient interval should again be taken into consideration, with a view to keeping the Sultan up to asserting his position there and realising his revenue. The presence of an intelligent officer would I believe materially conduce to the spread of civilising influence and to the reduction of the Sur community to order. His pre sence would at the same time encourage French Consuls to adhere to the terms of the Award and prevent flag-holders from assuming any unauthorised privileges on land. / Q C.

L — Jr -■Gnoranciurn, On the 22nd ct August last the French Minister made a coiximication regarding the situation created by the recent Muscat Arbitration Award and the pro cedure which the French Government proposed to follow in carrying it into execution. The proposals of the 'French Government have received careful consideration and appear to His Majesty*s Government to be accept able in the circumstances of the case. His Majesty's Government agree to the mainten ance of the status quo at luscat pending the arrival of Monsieur Laronce who will shortly return to his post furnished with the necessary Instructions from the French Government. They observe that the French ActingActing Consul at Ills cat has boon authorised, to renew biio temporary navigation xicenses of the I’rench pro* , * , t&amp;gSs, but they take note of the assurance that this measure will not in any way prevent the Arbitral Award being eventually applied in its entirety. On the other hand it appears to His Majesty’s Government that the maintenance of the status quo cannot affect the immediate coming into operation of the final clause of the Award, which lays down that ’’subjects of the Sultan of Muscat, who are owners or masters of dhows authorised to fly the French flag or who are members of the crews of such vessels or who belong to their families, do not enjoy in consequence of that fact any right of exterritoriality, which couldcould, exempt them from the sovereignty, especially irom the jurisdiction, of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat. 11 His ajesty 1 s Government take it as under stood that ail such persons have now come, as a matter of course, under His Highness's sovereignty and jurisdiction.

I think there are only two Omani subjects who will be able to establish a claim to having been under French pro- tection prior to 1863. i| ; 4 | B I fear that awkward incidents on II account of this concession will be of occasional occurrence, for example such v as that which took place in April 1903, reported by Major Cox in his letter Ho. 132 dated 11th April 1903. Ifthis is inclusive of (l) succession and (2) replacement of a worn :] l \ out ordestroyed Dhow, it means that the whole business will gradually die out.

The terms of this a ward I ho ld wit h the exception of clause four to oe in favour of His Majesty^ s Government, and it would seem that if the practice does not die out of itself, the advantages to be gained by the Arabs from the use of a Foreign flag would in consequence of increasing danger in the slave trade, hardly make it worth while for them to retain it. On this account His Highness the Sultan expects that many of them will before long wish to give up their authorisation of their own accord. 8c8cScSoScScScScScScSc&amp;ScSc&amp;:8cSc8cScSc8c8c8c6cN f ^ I l hK' £ STBPS TO BE TAKEN LOCALLY.

Lord Lansdowne is of opinion that the request of the French Government that there should he some delay in order to enable them to carry out the inves- f tigations rendered necessary by the Award is a rea sonable one. it is, moreover, desirable to be as conciliatory as possible, when so much depends on the spirit in which the French apply its terms. His Lordship is therefore prepared, if Mr. Brodrick sees no objection, to agree to the French proposal. There does not, however, appear to be any rea son to delay the application of the final clause of the Award. Lord Lanedowne proposes therefore, if Mr. Brodrick concurs, to Inform Monsieur Geoffray, in agreeing to the French proposal, that, as the Award lays down that French flagholders who are sub jects of the Sultan and their crews and families do not enjoy any right of exterritoriality, it is under stood that they have now come, as a matter of course under His Highness's sovereignty and jurisdiction.

(lOHr } THE HAGUE, August 8th, 1905. % Lord:- I have the honour to report that the Mus cat Arbitration Tribunal met at 3 o'clock this after noon and the Award, copy of which is herewith an nexed, was read aloud by the Secretary General in French and English. As regards (a) the scope of the Declara tion of torch 10th, 1862, in relation to the issue by France to certain subjects of the Sultan of Mus cat of papers authorising them to fly the French flag, the Award decides that:- / / V ' (l) Before the 2nd of January 1892 France was entitled to authorise vessels belonging to sub jects of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat to fly the French flag, only bound by her own legislation and administrative rales'. The date in question is that of the Rati fication The Marquess of Lansdowne, K.G., &lt;§iC ■, &amp;c •, &amp;c. ,Ratification of the Brussels Act, the Court holding that Prance is, in relation to Great Britain, hound to grant her flag only under the conditions prescribed by Article Z2 of that Act. w (2) Owners of dhows, who before 1892 have been authorised by Prance to fly the Prench flag, retain this authorisation as long as Prance renews it to the grantee'. ' (?) A.fter January 2nd, 1892, Prance was not entitled to authorise vessels belonging to subjects of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat to fly the Prench flag, except on condition that their owners or fit- ters-cut had established or should establish that they had been considered and treated by Prance as her 'proteges” before the year 186?'. The year 186? is taken as the date at which, m virtue of legislation by the Ottoman Porte and 01 the Franco-Moroccan Treaty of that year, the crea tion of new 'proteges' was regulated and limited. As regards (B) the nature of the privileges and immunities claimed by subjects of the Sultan who a^.e owners 01 masters of dnows and possess Prench papers&amp; p papers or are members of the crew of such dhows and their families, especially as to the manner in which such privileges and immunities affect the jurisdic tion of His Highness over his said subjects, the Award decides that: '!• Dhows of Muscat authorised as aforesaid to fly the French flag are entitled in the terri torial waters of Muscat to the inviolability provi ded by the French-Muscat Treaty of November 17th, 1844’’: *(2) The authorisation to fly the French flag cannot be transmitted or transferred to any other person or to any other dhow, even if belonging to the same owner”. ”(3) Subjects of the Sultan of Muscat, who are owners or masters of dhows authorised to fly the French flag or who are members of the crews of such vessels or who belong to their families, do not en joy in consequence of that fact any right of exter ritoriality, which could exempt them from the sover eignty, especially from the jurisdiction, of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat”. TheThe results of the Award may he summarised as follows. Prance may renew the licenses to fly the French flag granted to owners of dhows before January 2nd, 1892. But no licenses given since that date are valid, unless the grantee was a bona fide French protege before 1863. This decision will, it is believed, reduce the number of French flagholders to the number of 10 or 12 at the utmost. Moreover under Article 2 of (B) the licenses in question cannot be transmitted or transferred to any other dhow, even if belonging to the same owner. Thus it would appear that if one of the licensed dhows were to be lost or disabled, the owner, in order to obtain a new license, must prove that he comes under the category of those who were bona fide French prote ges before 1863. Such proteges must now be scarce, and the number of French flagholders should, in one course of a few years, be reduced to vanishing point. Under Article I of (b) dhows flying the French flag are declared to be inviolable in Muscat waters, and/ 9 ) and thus they are exempt from search. This deci sion is regrettable in view of the active partici pation of such dhows in the Slave Trade. But un der Article 5 of (B) the owners. Masters and crews of the dhows, or their families are expressly de clared not to enjoy any such inviolability and, the moment they set foot in Muscat territory, they come under the sovereignty and jurisdiction of the Sul tan. The Tribunal has definitely laid down that the withdrawal of such persons from the Sultan’s sover eignty and jurisdiction would be in contradiction with the Declaration of March 10th, 1862. This important decision will no doubt afford much satis faction to the Sultan and determines, entirely in His Highness* favour, the controversy regarding the three French protected Buris who broke quarantine in April 1905, the incident which in reality gave rise to the present Arbitration. After the Secretary General had finished read- ing the Award, the President made a brief speech thanking the Agents and Secretaries for the manner in _in which they had assisted the Court and then declared the proceedings at an end.

The President calls on the Secretary-General of the Tribunal to read the Award of the Tribunal, which is as follows: “The Tribunal of Arbitration constituted in virtue of the Compromis concluded at London on October 13, 1904 between Great Britain and France ; Whereas the Government of His Britannic Majesty and that of the French Republic have thought it right by the Declaration of March 10, 1862 “to engage reciprocally to respect the independence , ’ of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat, Whereas difficulties as to the scope of that Declaration have arisen in relation to the issue, by the French Republic, to certain subjects of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat of papers authorizing them to fly the French flag, and also as to the nature of the privileges and immunities claimed by subjects of His Highness who are owners or masters of dhows and in possession of such papers or are members of the crew of such dhows and their families, especially as to the manner in which such privileges and immunities affect the jurisdiction of His Highness the Sultan over his said subjects, Whereas the two Governments have agreed by the Compromis of October 13, 1904 that these questions shall be determined by reference to arbitration, in accordance with the provisions of article 1 of the Convention concluded between the two Powers on the 14 th of October 1903 , Whereas in virtue of that Gompromis were named as Arbitrators, by the Government of His Britannic Majesty: Mr. Melville W. Fuller, Chief Justice of the United States of America , andby the Government of the French Republic : Jonkheer A. F. de Savornin Lohman, Doctor of Law, former Minister of the Interior in the Netherlands, former Professor at the free University at Amsterdam, Member of the Second Chamber of the States- General, Whereas the two Arbitrators not having agreed within one month from the date of their appointment in the choice of an Umpire, and that choice having then been intrusted in virtue of article 1 of the Compromis to the King of Italy, His Majesty has named Umpire: Mr. H. Lammasch, Doctor of Law, Professor at the University at Vienna, Member of the Upper House of the Austrian Parliament, Whereas the Cases, Counter-Cases and Arguments have been duly communicated to the Tribunal and to the Parties , Whereas the Tribunal has carefully examined these documents, and the supplementary observations which were delivered to it by the two Parties; AS TO THE FIRST QUESTION: Whereas generally speaking it belongs to every Sovereign to decide to whom he will accord the right to fly his flag and to prescribe the rules governing such grants, and whereas therefore the granting of the French flag to subjects of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat in itself constitutes no attack on the independence of the Sultan, Whereas nevertheless a Sovereign may be limited by treaties in the exercise of this right, and whereas the Tribunal is authorized in virtue of article 48 of the Convention for the pacific settlement of international disputes of July 29, 1899 and of article 5 of the Compromis of October 13, 1904 “to declare its competence in interpreting the compromis as well as the other treaties which may be invoked in the case, and in applying the principles of international law”, and whereas therefore the question arises, under what conditions Powers which have acceded to the General Act of the Brussels Conference of July 2, 1890 relative to the African Slave Trade, especially to article 32 of this Act, are entitled to authorize native vessels to fly their flags, Whereas by article 32 of this Act the faculty of the Signatory Powers to grant their flag to native vessels has been limited for thepurpose of suppressing slave trading and in the general interests of humanity, irrespective of whether the applicant for the flag may belong to a state signatory of this Act or not, and whereas at any rate France is m relation to Great Britain bound to grant her flag only under the conditions prescribed by this Act, Wheieas in order to attain the above mentioned purpose, the Signatory Powers of the Brussels Act have agreed in its article 32 that the authority to fly the flag of one of the Signatory Powers shall in future only be granted to such native vessels, which shall satisfy all the three following conditions: 1. flheir fitters-out or owners must be either subjects of or persons protected by the Power whose flag they claim to fly, 2. They must furnish proof that they possess real estate situated in the district of the authority to whom their application is addressed, or supply a solvent security as a guarantee for any fines to which they may eventually become liable, 3. Such fitters-out or owners, as well as the captain of the vessel, must furnish proof that they enjoy a good reputation, and especially that they have never been condemned for acts of slave trade, 'Whereas in default of a definition of the term “prot6g6” in the General Act of the Brussels Conference this term must be under stood in the sense which corresponds best as well to the elevated aims of the Conference and its Final Act, as to the principles of the law of nations, as they have been expressed in treaties existing at that time, in internationally recognized legislation and in international practice, Whereas the aim of the said article 32 is to admit to navigation in the seas infested by slave trade only those native vessels which are under the strictest surveillance of the Signatory Powers, a condition which can only be secured if the owners, fitters-out and crews of such vessels are exclusively subjected to the sovereignty and jurisdiction of the State, under whose flag they are sailing, Whereas since the restriction which the term “proteg6” underwent in virtue of the legislation of the Ottoman Porte of 1863, 1865 and 1869, especially of the Ottoman law of 23 Sefer 1280 (August 1863) implicitly44 — accepted by the Powers who enjoy the rights of capitulations, and since the Treaty concluded between France and Morocco in 1863, to which a great number of other Powers have acceded and which received the sanction of the Convention of Madrid of July 30, 1880, the term “protege” embraces in relation to States of capitulations only the following classes 1°. persons being subjects of a country which is under the protectorate of the Power whose protection they claim, 2o. individuals corresponding to the classes enumerated in the treaties with Morocco of 1863 and 1880 and in the Ottoman law of 1863, 3°. persons, who under a special treaty have been recognized as “proteges” like those enumerated by article 4 of the French Muscat Convention of 1844 and 4°. those individuals who can establish that they had been considered and treated as “proteges” by the Power in question before the year in which the creation of new “proteges” was regulated and limited, that is to say before the year 1863 , these individuals not having lost the status they had once legitimately acquired, Whereas that, although the Powers have expresses verbis resigned the exercise of the pretended right to create “proteges” in unlimited number only in relation to Turkey and Morocco, nevertheless the exercise of this pretended right has been abandoned also in relation to other Oriental States, analogy having always been recognized as a mean to complete the very deficient written regulations of the capitulations as far as circumstances are analogous, Whereas on the other hand the concession de facto made by Turkey, that the status of “proteges” be transmitted to the descendants of persons, who in 1863 had enjoyed the protection of a Christian Power, cannot be extended by analogy to Muscat, where the circum stances are entirely dissimilar, the “proteges” of the Christian Powers in Turkey being of race, nationality and religion different from their Ottoman rulers, whilst the inhabitants of Sur and other Muscat people who might apply for French flags, are in all these respects entirely in the same condition as the other subjects of the Sultan of Muscat, Whereas the dispositions of article 4 of the French-Muscat Treaty of 1844 apply only to persons who are bona fide in the service of French subjects, but not to persons who ask for ships-papers for the purpose of doing any commercial business, Whereas the fact of having granted before the ratification of the Brussels Act on January 2 1892 authorizations to fly the French flag to native vessels not satisfying the conditions prescribed by article 32 of this Act was not in contradiction with any international obligation of France,FOR THESE REASONS, decides and pronounces as follows: l». before the 2 nd 0 f January 1892 France was entitled to authorize vessels belonging to subjects of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat to fly the French flag, only bound by her own legislation and administrative rules; 2». owners of dhows, who before 1892 have been authorized by France to fly the French flag, retain this authorization as long as France renews it to the grantee; 3». after January 2, 1892 France was not entitled to authorize vessels belonging to subjects of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat to fly the French flag, except on condition that their owners or fitters-out had established or should establish that they had been considered and treated by France as her “proteges” before the year 1863; AS TO THE 2ND QUESTION: Whereas the legal situation of vessels flying foreign flags and of the owners of such vessels in the territorial waters of an Oriental State is determined by the general principles of jurisdiction, by the capitulations or other treaties and by the practice resulting therefrom, Whereas the terms of the Treaty of Friendship and Commerce between I ranee and the Iman of Muscat of November 17, 1844 are, particularly in view of the language of article 3 “Nul ne pourra, sous aucun pretexte, penetrer dans les maisons, magasins et autres propriety, possedes ou occupes par des Fran^ais ou par des personnes au service des Frangais, ni les visiter sans le consentement de I'occupant, a moins que ce ne soit avec ^intervention du Consul de France”, comprehensive enough to embrace vessels as well as other property, Wheieas, although it cannot be denied that by admitting the right of France to grant under certain circumstances her flag to native vessels and to have these vessels exempted from visitation by the authorities of the Sultan or in his name, slave trade is facilitated, because slave traders may easily abuse the French flag for the purpose of escaping from search, the possibility of this abuse, which can be entirely suppressed by the accession of all Powers to article 42 of the Brussels Convention, cannot affect the decision of this case, which must only rest on juridical grounds, Wheieas according to the articles 31—41 of the Brussels Act the grant of the flag to a native vessel is strictly limited to this vessel and its46 — owner and therefore not transmissible or transferable to any other person or to any other vessel, even if belonging to the same owner, Whereas article 4 of the French-Muscat Treaty of 1844 grants to those subjects of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat “qui seront au service des Frangais” the same protection as to the French themselves, but whereas the owners, masters and crews of dhows authorized to fly the French flag do not belong to that class of persons and still less do the members of their families, Whereas the withdrawal of these persons from the sovereignty, especially from the jurisdiction of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat would be in contradiction with the Declaration of March 10, 1862, by which France and Great Britain engaged themselves reciprocally to respect the independence of this Prince, FOR THESE REASONS, decides and pronounces as follows: K dhows of Muscat authorized as aforesaid to fly the French flag are entitled in the territorial waters of Muscat to the inviolability provided by the French-Muscat Treaty of November 17, 1844; 2°. the authorization to fly the French flag cannot be transmitted or transferred to any other person or to any other dhow, even if belonging to the same owner; 3°. subjects of the Sultan of Muscat, who are owners or masters of dhows authorized to fly the French flag or who are members of the crews of such vessels or who belong to their families, do not enjoy in consequence of that fact any right of exterritoriality, which could exempt them from the sovereignty, especially from the jurisdiction, of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat.

PERMANENT COURT OF ARBITRATION at the Hague. -A.'W_A_ IR, 3D OF THE TRIBUNAL OF ARBITRATION CONSTITUTED in virtue of the Compromis signed at London on October 13, 1904 BETWEEN GREAT BRITAIN and FRANCE. The Tribunal of Arbitration constituted in virtue of the Compromis concluded at London on October 13, 1904 between Great Britain and France; Whereas the Government of His Britannic Majesty and that of the French Republic have thought it right by the Declaration of March 10, 1862 “to engage reciprocally to respect the independence” of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat, Whereas difficulties as to the scope of that Declaration have arisen in relation to the issue, by the French Republic, to certain subjects of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat of papers authorizing them to fly the French flag, and also as to the nature of the privileges and immunities claimed by subjects of His Highness who are owners or masters of dhows and in possession of such papers or are members of the crew of such dhows and their families, especially as to the manner in which such privileges and immunities affect the jurisdiction of His Highness the Sultan over his said subjects, Whereas the two Governments have agreed by the Compromis of October 13, 1904 that these questions shall be determined by reference to arbitration, in accordance with the provisions of article 1 of the Convention concluded between the two Powers on the 14 th of October 1903 ,n 10 Whereas in virtue of that Compromis were named as Arbitrators, by the Government of His Britannic Majesty: Mr. Melville W. Fuller, Chief Justice of the United States of America, and by the Government of the French Republic: Jonkheer A. F. de Savornin Lohman, Doctor of Law, former Minister of the Interior in the Netherlands, former Professor at the free University at Amsterdam, Member of the Second Chamber oftheStates- General, Whereas the two Arbitrators not having agreed within one month from the date of their appointment in the choice of an Umpire, and that choice having then been intrusted in virtue of article 1 of the Compromis to the King of Italy, His Majesty has named Umpire: Mr. H. Lammasch, Doctor of Law, Professor at the University at Vienna, Member of the Upper House of the Austrian Parliament, V hereas the Cases, Counter-Cases and Arguments have been duly communicated to the Tribunal and to the Parties , Whereas the Tribunal has carefully examined these documents, and the supplementary observations which were delivered to it by the two Parties; AS TO THE FIRST QUESTION: Whereas generally speaking it belongs to every Sovereign to decide whom he v ill accoid the right to fly his flag and to prescribe the rules governing such giants, and whereas therefore the granting of the French flag to subjects of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat in itself constitutes no attack on the independence of the Sultan, Whereas nevertheless a Sovereign may be limited by treaties in the exercise of this right, and whereas the Tribunal is authorized in virtue of article 48 of the Convention for the pacific settlement of international disputes of July 29, 1899 and of article 5 of the Compromis of October 13, 1904 “to declare its competence in interpreting the compromis as well as the other treaties which may be invoked in the case, and in applying the principles of international law”, and whereas therefore the question arises, un er what conditions Powers which have acceded to the General Act ofthe Brussels Conference of July 2, 1890 relative to the African Slave Trade, especially to article 32 of this Act, are entitled to authorize native vessels • to fly their flags, Whereas by article 32 of this Act the faculty of the Signatory Powers to grant their flag to native vessels has been limited for the purpose of suppressing slave trading and in the general interests of humanity, irrespective of whether the applicant for the flag may. belong to a state signatory of this Act or not, and whereas at any rate France is in relation to Great Britain bound to grant her flag only under the conditions prescribed by this Act, Whereas in order to attain the above mentioned purpose, the Signatory Powers of the Brussels Act have agreed in its article 32 that the authority to fly the flag of one of the Signatory Powers shall in future only be granted to such native vessels, which shall satisfy all the three following conditions: 1. Their fitters-out or owners must be either subjects of or persons protected by the Power whose flag they claim to fly, 2. They must furnish proof that they possess real estate situated in the district of the authority to whom their application is addressed, or supply a solvent security as a guarantee for any fines to which they may eventually become liable, 3. Such fitters-out or owners, as well as the captain of the vessel, must furnish proof that they enjoy a good reputation, and especially that they have never been condemned for acts of slave trade, Whereas in default of a definition of the term “protege” in the General Act of the Brussels Conference this term must be under stood in the sense which corresponds best as well to the elevated aims of the Conference and its Final Act, as to the principles of the law of nations, as they have been expressed in treaties existing at that time, in internationally recognized legislation and in international practice, Whereas the aim of the said article 32 is to admit to navigation in the seas infested by slave trade only those native vessels which are under the strictest surveillance of the Signatory Powers, a condition which can only be secured if the owners, fitters-out and crews of such vessels are exclusively subjected to the sovereignty and jurisdiction of the State, under whose flag they are sailing,12 — Whereas since the restriction which the term u prot6g6” underwent in virtue of the legislation of the Ottoman Porte of 1863, 1865 and 1869, especially of the Ottoman law of 23 Sefer 1280 (August 1863) implicitly accepted by the Powers who enjoy the rights of capitulations, and since the Treaty concluded between France and Morocco in 1863, to which a great number of other Powers have acceded and which received the sanction of the Convention of Madrid of July 30, 1880, the term a proteg6” embraces in relation to States of capitulations only the following classes 1°. persons being subjects of a country which is under the protectorate of the Power whose protection they claim, 2o. individuals corresponding to the classes enumerated in the treaties with Morocco of 1863 and 1880 and in the Ottoman law of 1863, 3°. persons, who under a special treaty have been recognized as “proteges” like those enumerated by article 4 of the French Muscat Convention of 1844 and 4°. those individuals who can establish that they had been considered and treated as “proteges” by the Power in question before the year in which the creation of new “proteges” was regulated and limited, that is to say before the year 1863 , these individuals not having lost the status they had once legitimately acquired, Whereas that, although the Powers have expressis verbis resigned the exercise of the pretended right to create “prot6g6s” in unlimited number only in relation to Turkey and Morocco, nevertheless the exercise of this pretended right has been abandoned also in relation to other Oriental States, analogy having always been recognized as a mean to complete the very deficient written regulations of the capitulations as far as circumstances are analogous, Whereas on the other hand the concession de facto made by Turkey, that the status of “proteges” be transmitted to the descendants of persons, who in 1863 had enjoyed the protection of a Christian Power, cannot be extended by analogy to Muscat, where the circum stances are entirely dissimilar, the “proteges” of the Christian Powers in Turkey being of race, nationality and religion different from their Ottoman rulers, whilst the inhabitants of Sur and other Muscat people who might apply for French flags, are in all these respects entirely in the same condition as the other subjects of the Sultan of Muscat, Whereas the dispositions of article 4 of the French-Muscat Treaty of 1844 apply only to persons who are bona fide in the service of Jrench subjects, but not to persons who ask for ships-papers for the purpose of doing any commercial business, Whereas the fact of having granted before the ratification of the Brussels Act on January 2 1892 authorizations to fly the French flag to native vessels not satisfying the conditions prescribed by article 32 ofi — 13 — this Act was not in contradiction with any international obligation of France, FOR THESE REASONS, decides and pronounces as follows : 1°. before the 2nd of January 1892 France was entitled to authorize vessels belonging to subjects of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat to fly the French flag, only bound by her own legislation and administrative rules; 2°. owners of dhows, who before 1892 have been authorized by France to fly the French flag, retain this authorization as long as France renews it to the grantee; 3°. after January 2, 1892 France was not entitled to authorize vessels belonging to subjects of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat to fly the French flag, except on condition that their owners or fitters-out had established or should establish that they had been considered and treated by France as her “proteges” before the year 1863; AS TO THE 2ND QUESTION: Whereas the legal situation of vessels flying foreign flags and of the owners of such vessels in the territorial waters of an Oriental State is determined by the general principles of jurisdiction, by the capitulations or other treaties and by the practice resulting therefrom, Whereas the terms of the Treaty of Friendship and Commerce between France and the Iman of Muscat of November 17, 1844 are, particularly in view of the language of article 3 “Nul ne pourra, sous aucun pretexte, penetrer dans les maisons, magasins et autres propri6tes, possedes ou occupes par des Frangais ou par des personnes au service des Frangais, ni les visiter sans le consentement de I'occupant, a moins que ce ne soit avec 1’intervention du Consul de France”, comprehensive enough to embrace vessels as well as other property, Whereas, although it cannot be denied that by admitting the right of France to grant under certain circumstances her flag to native vessels and to have these vessels exempted from visitation by the authorities of the Sultan or in his name, slave trade is facilitated, because slave traders may easily abuse the French flag for the purpose of escaping from search, the possibility of this abuse, which can be entirely suppressed by the accession of all Powers to article 42 of the Brussels Convention, cannot affect the decision of this case, which must only rest on juridical grounds, Whereas according to the articles 31—41 of the Brussels Act the14 grant of the flag to a native vessel is strictly limited to this vessel aaid. its owner and therefore not transmissible or transferable to any other person or to any other vessel, even if belonging to the same owner, Whereas article 4 of the French-Muscat Treaty of 1844 grants to those subjects of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat “qui seront au service des Frangais” the same protection as to the French themselves, but whereas the owners, masters and crews of dhows authorized to fly the French flag do not belong to that class of persons and still less do the members of their families, Whereas the withdrawal of these persons from the sovereignty, especially from the jurisdiction of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat would be in contradiction with the Declaration of March 10, 1862, by which France and Great Britain engaged themselves reciprocally to respect the independence of this Prince, 1°. dhows of Muscat authorized as aforesaid to fly the French flag are entitled in the territorial waters of Muscat to the inviolability provided by the French-Muscat Treaty of November 17, 1844; 2°. the authorization to fly the French flag cannot be transmitted or transferred to any other person or to any other dhow, even if belonging to the same owner; 3°. subjects of the Sultan of Muscat, who are owners or masters of dhows authorized to fly the French flag or who are members of the crews of such vessels or who belong to their families, do not enjoy in consequence of that fact any right of exterritoriality, which could exempt them from the sovereignty, especially from the jurisdiction, of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat.

[The Agreements dated October 13, 1904, and January 18, 1905, were published in “ Treaty Series No. 3, 1905.”] Mr. Graham to the Marquess of Lansdowne.—{Received August 9.) My Lord, Hague, August 8, 1905. I HAVE the honour to report that the Muscat Arbitration Tribunal met at 3 o’clock this afternoon and the Award, copy of which is herewith annexed, was read aloud by the Secretary-General in French and English. As regards (a), the scope of the Declaration of the 10th March, 1862, in relation to the issue by France to certain subjects of the Sultan of Muscat of papers authorizing them to fly the French flag, the Award decides that:— “1. Before the 2nd January, 1892, France was entitled to authorize vessels belonging to subjects of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat to fly the French flag, only bound by her own legislation and administrative rules.” The date in question is that of the ratification of the Brussels Act, the Court holding that France is, in relation to Great Britain, bound to grant her flag only under the conditions prescribed by Article 32 of that Act. “ 2. Owners of dhows, who before 1892 have been authorized by France to fly the French flag, retain this authorization as long as France renews it to the grantee. “3. After the 2nd January, 1892, France was not entitled to authorize vessels belonging to subjects of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat to fly the French flag, except on condition that their owners or fitters-out had established, or should establish, that they had been considered and treated by France as her ‘ proteges ’ before the year 1863.” The year 1863 is taken as the date at which, in virtue of legislation by the Ottoman Porte, and of the Franco-Moroccan Treaty of that year, the creation of new “proteges ” was regulated and limited. As regards (6), the nature of the privileges and immunities claimed by subjects of the Sultan who are owners or masters of dhows and possess French papers, or are members of the crew of such dhows, and their families, especially as to the manner in which such privileges and immunities affect the jurisdiction of His Highness over his said subjects, the Award decides that:— “1. Dhows of Muscat authorized as aforesaid to fly the French flag are entitled, in the territorial waters of Muscat, to the inviolability provided by the French-Muscat Treaty of the 17th November, 1844. “ 2. The authorization to fly the French flag cannot be transmitted or transferred to any other person or to any other dhow, even if belonging to the same owner. “3. Subjects of the Sultan of Muscat who are owners or masters of dhows authorized to fly the French flag, or who are members of the crews of such vessels, or who belong to their families, do not enjoy, in consequence of that fact, any right of exterritoriality, wdiich could exempt them from the sovereignty, especially from the jurisdiction, of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat.” The results of the Award may be summarized as follows :— France may renew the licences to fly the French flag granted to owners of dhows before the 2nd January, 1892. But no licences given since that date are valid, unless the grantee was a, bond fide French protege before 1863. Moreover, under Article 2 of (6),^ the licences in question cannot be transmitted or transferred to any other dhow, even if belonging to the same owner. Thus it would appear that if one of the licensed dhows were to be lost or disabled, the owner, in order to obtain a new licence, must [1008] B 26 (Official Translation.) Meeting of Tuesday, August 8, 1905. THE Tribunal met at 3 p.m. The President calls on the Secretary-General of the Tribunal to read the Award of the Tribunal, which is as follows :— The Tribunal of Arbitration constituted in virtue of the ‘ c Compromis” concluded at London on the 13th October, 1904, between Great Britain and Prance; Whereas the Government of His Britannic Majesty and that of the French Bepublic have thought it right by the Declaration of the 10th March, 1862, “ to engage reciprocally to respect the independence ” of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat; Whereas difficulties as to the scope of that Declaration have arisen in relation to the issue, by the French Bepublic, to certain subjects of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat of papers authorizing them to fly the French flag, and also as to the nature of the privileges and immunities claimed by subjects of His Highness who are owners or masters of dhows and in possession of such papers or are members of the crew of such dhows and their families, especially as to the manner in which such privileges and immunities affect the jurisdiction of His Highness the Sultan over his said subjects; Whereas the two Governments have agreed by the “ Compromis ” of the 13th October, 1904, that these questions shall be determined by reference to arbitration, in accordance with the provisions of Article I of the Convention concluded between the two Powers on the 14th October, 1903 ; Whereas in virtue of that “ Compromis ” were named as Arbitrators— By the Government of His Britannic Majesty, Mr. Melville W. Fuller, Chief Justice of the United States of America ; And by the Government of the French Bepublic, Jonkheer A. F. de Savornin Lehman, Doctor of Law, former Minister of the Interior in the Netherlands, former Professor at the Free University at Amsterdam, Member of the* Second Chamber of the States-General; Whereas the two Arbitrators not having agreed within one month from the date of their appointment in the choice of an Umpire, and that choice having then been intrusted in. virtue oi Article I of the “ Compromis ” to the King of Italv, His Majesty has named Umpire : J J Mi. H. Lammasch, Doctor of Law, Professor at the Universitv at Vienna Member of the Upper House of the Austrian Parliament; AV r !! e . J 1 ’ eas t lie Cases &gt; Counter-Cases, and Arguments have been duly communicated to the Tribunal and to the Parties ; Whereas the Tribunal has carefully examined these documents, and the supple mentary observations which were delivered to it by the two Parties; As to the first question: Whereas generally speaking it belongs to every Sovereign to decide to whom he will accord the right to fly his flag and to prescribe the rules governing such grants and whereas therefore_ the granting of the French flag to subjects of His Highness' the Sultan of Muscat in itself constitutes no attack on the independence of the Sultan- . P hereas nevertheless a Sovereign may be limited by Treaties in the exercise of tins right, and whereas the Tribunal is authorized in virtue of Article XLVIII of the Convention for the pacific settlement of international disputes of the 29th July, 1899 and of Article V of the “Compromis” of the 13th October, 1904, “to declare its competence m interpreting the ‘ Compromis ’ as well as the other Treaties which may be invoked m the Case, and in applying the principles of international law,” and wdiereas therefore the question arises, under what conditions Powers which have acceded to the General Act of the Brussels Conference of the 2nd July, 1890, relative to the African slave trade especially to Article XNXII of this Act, are entitled to authorize native vessels to fly their flags; Whereas by Article XXXII of this Act the faculty of the Signatory Powers togrant their flag to native vessels has been limited for the purpose of suppressing slave trading and in the general interests of humanity, irrespective of whether the applicant for the flag may belong to a State signatory of this Act or not, and whereas at any rate Prance is in relation to Great Britain hound to grant her flag only under the conditions prescribed by this Act; Whereas, in order to attain the above-mentioned purpose, the Signatory Powers of the Brussels Act have agreed in its Article XXXII that the authority to fly the flag of one of the Signatory Powers shall in future only he granted to such native vessels which shall satisfy all the three following conditions :— 1. Their fitters-out or owners must be either subjects of or persons protected by the Power whose flag they claim to fly ; 2. They must furnish proof that they possess real estate situated in the district of the authority to whom their application is addressed, or supply a solvent security as a guarantee for any fines to which they may eventually become liable ; 3. Such fitters-out or owners, as well as the captain of the vessel, must furnish proof that they enjoy a good reputation, and especially that they have never been condemned for acts of Slave Trade; Whereas, in default of a definition of the term “protege” in the General Act of the Brussels Conference this term must be understood in the sense which corresponds best as well to the elevated aims of the Conference and its Pinal Act as to the principles of the law of nations as they have been expressed in Treaties existing at that time in internationally recognized legislation and in international practice; Whereas the aim of the said Article XXXII is to admit to navigation in the seas infested by Slave Trade only those native vessels which are under the strictest surveillance of the Signatory Powers, a condition which can only be secured if the owners, fitters-out, and crews of such vessels are exclusively subjected to the sovereignty and jurisdiction of the State under whose flag they are sailing; Whereas since the restriction which the term “ protege ” underwent in virtue of the legislation of +he Ottoman Porte of 1863, 1865, and 1869, especially of the Ottoman Law fit 23 Sefer, 1280 (August 1863), implicitly accepted by the Powers jvliq efibov the rights of capitulations, and since the Treaty ^concluded between Prance and Morq^ 00 i n 1803, to which a great number of other Powers have acceded, and which red e i ve d the sanction of the Convention of Madrid of the 30th July, 1880, the term “ protege ” embraces in relation to States of capitulations only the following classes : (A) persons being subjects of a country 'which is under the protectorate of the Power Wipse protection they claim ; (2) individuals corresponding to the classes enumerated in the Treaties with Morocco of 1863 and 1880 and in the Ottoman Law of 1863; (3) persons who, under a special Treaty,.have been recognized as “proteges” like those enumerated by Article IY of the Prench-Muscat Convention of 1844; and (4) those individuals who can establish that they had been considered and treated as “ proteges ” by the Power in question before the year in which the creation of new “ proteges ” was regulated and limited, that is to say, before the year 1863, these individuals not having lost the status they had once legitimately acquired; Whereas that, although the Powers have expressis verbis resigned the exercise of the pretended right to create “proteges” in unlimited number only in relation to Turkey and Morocco, nevertheless the exercise of this pretended right has been abandoned also in relation to other Oriental States, analogy having always been recognized as a means to complete the very deficient written regulations of the capitulations as far as circumstances are analogous; Whereas, on the other hand, the concession de facto made by Turkey that the status of “proteges” be transmitted to the descendants of persons who in 1863 had enjoyed the protection of a Christian Power, cannot be extended by analogy to Muscat, where the circumstances are entirely dissimilar, the “proteges” of the Christian Powers in Turkey being of race, nationality, and religion different from their Ottoman Eulers, whilst the inhabitants of Sur and other Muscat people who might apply for Trench flags are in all these respects entirely in the same condition as the other subjects of the Sultan of Muscat; Whereas the dispositions of Article IV of the Prench-Muscat Treaty of 1844 apply only n persons who are bond fide in the service of Prench subjects, but not to persons who ask for ships’ papers for the purpose of doing any commercial business; Whems the fact of having granted before the ratification of the Brussels Act on the 2nd Jaiuary, 1892, authorizations to fly the Prench flag to native vessels not [100^ _ , - Csatisfying the conditions prescribed by Article XXXII of this Act was not in contradiction with any international obligation of Erance; Eor these reasons, decides and pronounces as follows:— 1. Before the 2nd January, 1892, Erance was entitled to authorize vessels' belonging to subjects of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat to fly the Erench flag, only bound by her own legislation and administrative rules ; 2. Owners of dhows who before 1892 have been authorized by Eranee to fly the Erench flag retain this authorization as long as Erance renews it to the grantee; 3. After the 2nd January, 1892, Erance was not entitled to authorize vessels belonging to subjects of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat to fly the Erench flag, except on condition that their owners or fitters-out had established, or should establish, that they had been considered and treated by Erance as her “ proteges ” before the year 1863. As to the second question :— Whereas the legal situation of vessels flying foreign flags and of the owners of such vessels in the territorial waters of an Oriental State is determined by the general principles of jurisdiction, by the capitulations or other Treaties, and by the practice resulting therefrom; MJiereas the terms of the Treaty of Eriendship and Con me between Erance ‘ and the Iman of Muscat of the 17th November, 1814, are, pai ularly in ieu of the language of Article III, “ Nul ne pourra, sous aucun preu te, pfnetrer dans les maisons, magasins et autres proprietes, possedes ou occupes p des Erai'.cais ou par des personnes au service des Erangais, ni les visiter sans le consentem* r do Eoccupant, a moins que ce ne soit avec Eintervention du Consul de Erance,’' comprehensive enough to embrace vessels as well as other property ; Whereas, although it cannot be denied that by admitting the right »f Erance to grant under certain circumstances* her flag to native vessels, and to have these vessels exempted from visitation by the authorities of the Sultan or in his name, slave trade is facilitated, because slave traders may easily abus£ the Erenjdi Wg for the purpose of escaping from search, the possibilitymf this abuse, which can 1 me • mppressed by the accession of all Powers to Article XLII of the Brussel C iv vq. -run^. affect the decision of this case, which must only rest on juridical grounds ; Whereas according to the Articles XXXI—XLI of the Brussels Ac 1 , tl &lt; ■ o-ra* 4 of the flag to a native vessel is strictly limited to this vessel and its owner, aad Utcr-• fore, not transmissible or transferable to any other person or to ai;y other ve&gt;s, : * :L ^ belonging to the same owner; Whereas Article IV of the Erench-Muscat Treaty of 1844 granm f 0 th ■ subjects of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat “ qui seront au service des Erra.-ga' * the same- protection as to the Erench themselves, but whereas the owners' masters, an 1 crews of dhows authorized to fly the Erench flag do not belong to that &gt;s of * sons, and still less do the members of their families; Whereas the withdrawal of these persons from the soveL ggiU ' mpe from the jurisdiction of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat, would b 1 in eo t, idi&lt; with the Declaration of the 10th March, 1862, by which Erance ai , re a E 4 ah ge themselves reciprocally to respect the independence of this P me; Eor these reasons, decides and pronounces as follow 1. Dhows of Muscat authorized as aforesaid to fly the Erench flag are entitled in the territorial waters of Muscat to the inviolability provided by the Erench-Muscat Treaty of the 17th November, 1844 ; 2. The authorization to fly the Erench flag cannot be transmitted or transferred to any other person or to any other dhow, even if belonging to the same owner; 3. Subjects of the Sultan of Muscat, who are owners or masters of dhow T s authorized to fly the Erench flag, or who are members of the crews of such vessels, or who belong to their families, do not enjoy in consequence of that fact aay right of exterritoriality which could exempt them from the sovereignty, especially from the jurisdiction, of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat.

I HAVE the honour to report that the Muscat Arbitration Tribunal met at 3 o’clock this afternoon and the Award, copy of which is herewith annexed, was read aloud by the Secretary-General in French and English. As regards (a), the scope of the Declaration of the 10th March, 1862, in relation to the issue by France to certain subjects of the Sultan of Muscat of papers authorizing them to fly the French flag, the Award decides that:— “ 1.

As regards (b), the nature of the privileges and immunities claimed by subjects of the Sultan who are owners or masters of dhows and possess French papers, or are members of the crew of such dhows, and their families, especially as to the manner in, which such privileges and immunities affect the jurisdiction of His Highness over his said subjects, the Award decides that:— “1. Dhows of Muscat authorized as aforesaid to fly the French flag are entitled, in the territorial waters of Muscat, to the inviolability provided by the French-Muscat Treaty of the 17th November, 1844. “ 2. The authorization to fly the French flag cannot be transmitted or transferred to any other person or to any other dhow, even if belonging to the same owner. “3.

Puller, Chief Justice of the United States of America ; And by the Government of the Prench Republic, Jonkheer A. P. de Savornin Lohman, Doctor of Law, former Minister of the Interior in the Netherlands, former Professor at the Pree University at Amsterdam, Member of the Second Chamber of the States-General; Whereas the two Arbitrators not having agreed within one month from the date of their appointment in the choice of an Umpire, and that choice having then been intrusted in virtue of Article I of the “ Compromis ” to the King of Italy, His Majesty has named Umpire : Mr. H. Lammasch, Doctor of Law, Professor at the University at Vienna, Member of the Upper House of the Austrian Parliament; Whereas the Cases, Counter-Cases, and Arguments have been duly communicated to the Tribunal and to the Parties ; Whereas the Tribunal has carefully examined these documents, and the supple mentary observations which were delivered to it by the two Parties; As to the first question: Whereas generally speaking it belongs to every Sovereign to decide to whom he will accord the right to fly his flag and to prescribe the rules governing such grants, and whereas therefore the granting of the Prench flag to subjects of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat in itself constitutes no attack on the independence of the Sultan; Whereas nevertheless a Sovereign may be limited by Treaties in the exercise of this right, and whereas the Tribunal is authorized in virtue of Article XLVTII of the Convention for the pacific settlement of international disputes of the 29th J uly, 1899, and of Article V of the “Compromis” of the 13th October, 1904, “to declare its competence in interpreting the ‘ Compromis ’ as well as the other Treaties which may be invoked in the Case, and in applying the principles of international law,” and whereas therefore the question arises, under what conditions Powers which have acceded to the General Act of the Brussels Conference of the 2nd July, 1890, relative to the African slave trade, especially to Article XXXII of this Act, are entitled to authorize native vessels to fly their flags; Whereas % Article XXXII of this Act the faculty of the Signatory Powers togrant their flag to native vessels has been limited for the purpose of suppressing slave trading and in the general interests of humanity, irrespective of whether the applicant for the flag may belong to a State signatory of this Act or not, and whereas at any rate Prance is in relation to Great Britain bound to grant her flag only under the conditions prescribed by this Act; Whereas, in order to attain the above-mentioned purpose, the Signatory Powers of the Brussels Act have agreed in its Article XXXII that the authority to fly the flag of one of the Signatory Powers shall in future only be granted to such native vessels which shall satisfy all the three following conditions :— 1.

Before the 2nd January, 1892, France was entitled to authorize vessels belonging to subjects of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat to fly the French flag, only bound by her own legislation and administrative rules ; 2 . Owners of dhows who before 1892 have been authorized by France to fly the French flag retain this authorization as long as France renews it to the grantee; 3. After the 2nd January, 1892, France was not entitled to authorize vessels belonging to subjects of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat to fly the French flag, except on condition that their owners or fitters-out had established, or should establish, that they had been considered and treated by France as her “proteges” before the year 1863. As to the second question :— Whereas the legal situation of vessels flying foreign flags and of the owners of such vessels in the territorial waters of an Oriental State is determined by the general principles of jurisdiction, by the capitulations or other Treaties, and by the practice resulting therefrom ; Whereas the terms of the Treaty of Friendship and Commerce between France and the Iman of Muscat of the 17th .November, 1841, are, particularly in view of the language of Article III, “ Xul ne pourra, sous aucun pretexte, penetrer dans les maisons, magasins et autres proprietes, possedes ou occupes par des Fia^ais ou par des personnes au service des Fran^ais, ni les visiter sans le consentement de Toccupant, a moins que ce ne soit avec I’intervention du Consul de France,” comprehensive enough to embrace vessels as well as other property ; Whereas, although it cannot be denied that by admitting the right of France to grant under certain circumstances her flag to native vessels, and to have these vessels ‘ exempted from visitation by the authorities of the Sultan or in his name, slave trade is facilitated, because slave traders may easily abuse the French flag for the purpose of escaping from search, the possibility of this abuse, which can be entirely suppressed by the accession of all Powers to Article XLII of the Brussels Convention, cannot affect the decision of this case, which must only rest on juridical grounds ; Whereas according to the Articles XXXI—XL! of the Brussels Act, the grant of the flag to a native vessel is strictly limited to this vessel and its owner, and therefore not transmissible or transferable to any other person or to any other vessel, even if belonging to the same owner; W hereas Article IV of the French-Muscat Treaty of 1844 grants to those subjects of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat “ qui seront au service des Franyais ” the same protection as to the French themselves, but whereas the owners, masters, and crews of dhows authorized to fly the French flag do not belong to that class of persons, and still less do the members of their families; W hereas the withdrawal of these persons from the sovereignty, especially from the jurisdiction of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat, would be in contradiction with the Declaration of the l()th March, 1862, by which France and Great Britain engaged themselves reciprocally to respect the independence of this Prince; For these reasons, decides and pronounces as follows :— 1. Dhows of Muscat authorized as aforesaid to fly the French flag are entitled in the territorial waters of Muscat to the inviolability provided by the French-Muscat Treaty of the 17th November, lb4l; 2.

His Excellency had understood from me that although His Majesty's Government were not to be precluded from watching over the Sultan's inter ests, and bringing forward any evidence which seemed to us material from that point of view, we had agreed that the Sultan was not to be a party to the arbitration in the sense in which France and Great Britain were par ties. It appeared however that Major Cox had told the Sultan that he was to be a party to the arbitration, and had suggested to him that he should be separately represented by Counsel.

I have the honour to forward, for the consideration of the Government of India, copies of the papers cited in the enclosed list, regarding a request which has been made by His Highness the Khan of Kalat for the restoration to him of the port of Gwadur, which is now in the possession of the Sultan of Maskat. /jT A f 2. As the Government of India are aware, Gwadur has hitherto been * Vide Aitcbison’s Treaties, Volume XI, page regarded, at least from the point of view 50 , and Curzon’s Persia, Volume II, page 432. 0 f the European historian,* as a de pendency of Maskat having been conferred at the close of the 18th century by Nasir Khan, Khan of Kalat, upon Saiyid Sultan, who had fled from Maskat after a dispute with his brother Saiyid Said, the then ruler of Maskat. 3. It would appear, however, from the papers of which copies are now- forwarded, that the statement of the case, which is to be found in Aitchison’s Treaties and in Curzon’s “ Persia,” is not altogether complete, and that, so far from Gwadur having been granted to the Maskat refugee as a free gift in sovereignty, it was bestowed upon him only as a temporary act of grace, and the suzerainty of the Khan of Kalat over the port was recognized by the Sultans of Maskat, at any rate up to the middle of the last century. 4. The Khan’s statement, as contained in his Murasila, dated the 5th September 1903, and supported by the evidence contained in the enclosures of this letter, is to the effect that Gwadur was granted to Saiyid Sultan by Mir Nasir Khan as Mehmani, i.e., as a sort of maintenance allowance bestowed upon a refugee seeking an asylum in his territories: that after the return of Saiyid°Sultan to Maskat, and his reconciliation to his brother, the ruler of Maskat, Gwadur was allowed to remain in Maskat possession on payment of tribute : that this tribute was paid as recently as the time of Nasir Khan II (who died in 1857) and that from the time of the attack upon Kalat by a British force in 1839 until recent years, the rulers of Kalat were too much occupied with the internal affairs of the State to make an effort to recover pos session of the port. 5. In support of the Khan’s contention, there is the following evidence: (a) The statement of Ghulam Hyder, Naib of Kalat, and son of Tawa- kal, former Naih of the State, to the effect that his father was originally a resident of Zanzibar and was sent in his youth to Nasir Khan II, as tribute from the Sultan of Maskat for Gwadur Bunder. (5) The statement of Zafaran, a woman of about 70 years of age, also from Zanzibar, that she was sent to Nasir Khan II by the ruler of Maskat with 17 other slaves, of whom it will be noted that Towakal, the father of the present Naib, was one. (c) The statement of Mirza Ghulam Husain Khan, Peshkar of His Highness the Khan of Kalat, whose ancestors were in tbe service of former rulers of the State. He states that from the time when Gwadur came into the possession of Sultan Saiyid up to the time 4413 F. D.of Mir Nasir Khan TI, the yearly despatch of presents (including slaves, camels, and perfumes) continued as a fixed tribute. (d) Note by Kazi Jalal-ud-din, C.I.E., Political Adviser to His Highness the Khan, with an extract from an old AX. S. History of the Ahmedzais, apparently written in Persian at the time o'f Nasir Khan I, which indicates that Gwadur was handed over to Sultan Saiyid for maintenance only, until such time as he should recover possession of his own country. This MS. work is written on regular paper and bound in leather. There is no date to the book, nor does it contain the name of the author. The first page consists of the usual religious exhorta tions ; after that some pages are missing ; and the book com mences with an account of the descent of the family of the Khans of Kalat from Mir Hassan, son of Goran, and ends* with the death of Nasir Khan I, at Gandava on 14 , Kabi-ul-Awal, A. H. 1208 (A.D. 1793 ). Written inside the cover is the name “Henry Green, Political Agent, Baluchistan” and the book presumably belonged to his library. This seems to authenticate the work as a reliable piece of evidence. (e) Extract from an ancient history of the family of the Governor of Kalat, which has b^en obtained by Kazi Jalal-ud-din, C. L E. Political Adviser to His Highness the Khan. (f) Local tradition, as ascertained by the Superintendent of the Census and Gazetteer in Baluchistan, and his subordinates, is clearly in favour of that vershm of the cession of Gwadur to Maskat which is put forward by the Khan. 6 . The evidence which has been obtained constitutes, in my opinion, a strong primdfacie case in support of the Khan’s contention. It is, I think, at any rate established that Gwadur was not originally made over uncondi tionally to Saiyid Sultan, and that the ruler of Maskat, for some considerable period after obtaining possession of the port (probably until the death of Mir Nasir Khan II in 1857 ) made presents to the Khan. Whether these presents can be regarded as having constituted a regular tribute or not, it is difficult to say, but there is a strong presumption that, had the title of the Maskat ruler to the possession of Gwadur been absolute and unconditional, the annual °ift of valuable presents would not have continued for so many years. 7 . In the past the history of Kalat has been so stormy that the Khans of Kalat have had little leisure to spend on the affairs of Makran ; but as the Government of India are aware steps have of recent years been taken to im- prove the administration of Makran, and this no doubt explains the present request of His Highness to be assisted in recovering this portion of his ancient possessions. I have no exact information to show the financial value of Gwadur to the Sultan of Maskat, nor whether he attaches any sentimental \ alue to the place. From Colonel Tate’s diarv of 6th December 1901 , it seems that the only income derived from the port is 22,000 dollars a year, ^gross income; and that it contains no Arab population other than the Wall’s escort. S. Considering the long possession enjoyed by the ruling family of Maskat, the Government of India might not be willing to support very stron^lv the proposal of His Highness the Khan against the wishes of the *SuJtan ; but I think that His Highness’s request that Government should take some steps to t further his wishes is not unreasonable, and I, therefore, submit his request for favourable consideration. His Highness would no doubt be •willing to compen sate the Sultan for any financial loss that he may incur on restoring the port to Kalat, but I have not thought it desirable to consult him on this subject, as it is possible that the Government of India may not consider the present time a favourable one for moving in the matter. The rising importance of Pasni of course tends to depreciate the value of Gwadur. 9 . If Major showers has obtained any further information during his recent tour in Makran, it will be submitted for the information of the Govern ment of India.j ^14 illi cit ^ umi ^3Qi^ itll opiiii,i It i nnc* lias! iiiiflfl eprsa if dint Blatrt: Mi at is Im rail fe [fiEtOt riimiia ar, 3« if liali'i : SIai3;, inaly ts d; W OUfiSlfe lt mP tiie p® 8 ^ press® tancs ® jhf ^ Go^ y 3 LIST OP ENCLOSURES. 1.

From accounts of former events I have heard that the Gwadur port belonged to the Kalat State and was ruled over by my ancestors. In the time of Mir Nasir Khan I (Great) a relative of the ruler (Sultan) of Maskat had some quarrel with the ruler and came to Khan Nasir Khan as a refugee. Mir Nasir Khan gave him the Gwadur port as Mehmani and sub sistence allowance. After some time the refugee returned to his own country (Maskat) and was reconciled to the ruler of Maskat. He however, maintained friendly relations with our family and used to send slaves, maid slaves, and other presents yearly. Owing to his friendly relations and sending presents my ancestors were pleased not to demand anything more from him. This practice of sending presents continued till the time of Mir Nasir Khan JI. On the occasion of a well known fight that took place in Mir Mehrab Khan’s time all sanads were lost with The attack on Kalat by a British force in other valuable property. Mir Mehrab 1839 * Khan and my father were kept so occu pied in the tribal affairs of their own State that they could not attend to the recovery of Gwadur. But I now put forward my claim for the same. I here with enclose a statement made by my Sardaftar (head munshi) which gives full particulars of my claim. It is very necessary that you should exert your self in this matter and ask the higher authorities to send up the case to Govern ment. I am sure that if the Government will take my claims into consider ation I shall succeed in getting my rights. ( 2 ) (f L O /V* /J'2 Translation of a statement made by Naib Ghulam Hyder, son of Tawakal, Naib of Kalat, on 6th September 1903. My father used always to say that he was originally a resident of Zangbar (Zanzibar) and he came in his youth to the Sultan of Maskat, who sent us to Mir Nasir Khan II, Khan of Kalat, as tribute for Gwadur Bunder. (3) Translation of the statement of Zafaran, a female slave at Kalat, taken by Kazi Jalal-ud-din, C.I.E. /fl Zafaran, daughtar of Dil Murad, Zangbari (dubious), aged nearly 70 years, states as follows:— “ We, 5 women and 13 men, were sent from Zangbar by the Governor of that place to the ruler of Maskat. I do not remember the names of the Gov-r ernors of Zangbar and of Maskat as I was very young at that time. On our arrival at Maskat we were kept in a place where dates are plentiful. I visited the house of the Governor several times. A few months subsequently, when it was the season of the ripening of dates, we were despatched to Kalat in the charge of one Abdul Ghani, an employe of Nasir Khan II. I am not aware why we were sent by him, whether in return for the Gwadur port “ Mahsul ” or for some other reason. The following are the names of the said women :— 1. Zafaran I. 2. Zafaran II. 3. Zafaran III. 4. Balela. 5. Barazin. following:— 5. Farhan. 6. Misat. 7. Nasib. S. Amadi. Note by Kazi Jalal-ud-din, C.I.E., with extract from old M. S. history of Ahmedzais. I have got an old history of Ahmedzais, the present ruling family of Kalat, which gives a very clear account of Gwadur port. The first and last portion of this history are missing, but the text shows that it was compiled in the time of Nasir Khan the Great. The events treated in the book bring the history down to the death of that potentate and this too points to the same conclusion. 2. There is a paragraph in this book in Persian which I give here verbatim. “ When there arose a friction between Sultan Said of Maskat and his brothers, the latter got the upper hand and expelled the former from the country. Sultan Said came to Khan Sahib (Nasir Khan) for help. The latter replied that he could not send his army to such a remote country (Maskat), but as he (Sultan Said) had travelled a long distance in coming over to him for help, he was ready to make over to him the revenues of the Gwadur port, which he would enjoy till he regained possession of his own country. Sultan Said then, repairing to the said port, settled busily there and enjoyed the revenues of that port.” 3. I have read an account of Sultan Said in another place which is briefly as follows:— J Of the names of the men I remember the 1. Sangar I. 2. Sangar II. 3. Oldi. 4. Tawakal. 9. Almas. the rest I forget. ( 5 ) In 1741 A. D., Imam Ahmed bin Masud, ancestor of Sultan Said, forcibly wrested the country of Maskat from the Sufwaya dynasty of Persia and he and his descendants continued to rule over this country and Zangbar which formed a part of Maskat. In 1805 A. D., Sultan Said ascended the throne of Maskat and after 52 years’ reign died in 1857. On his death his eldest son Imam Nazim succeeded him as Sultan of Maskat, while his youngest son Amir Majid was given the Government of Zanzibar. Subsequently the ruling family of Maskat se\eiod its connection with Maskat. The Government of both the countries, however, still continues in the hands of the descendants of the two brothers mentioned above. ip IaUJ ^ (®) F.xtract from an ancient history of the family of the Governor of Kalat, obtained by Kazi Jalal-ud-din, Political Adviser to His Highness the Khan. In the fight which took place between Sultan Said, Governor of Maskat, and his brothers, the latter being victorious banished the former. Sultanv Said came to the Khan and sought assistance. The Khan’s reply was as follows :— Owing to the great distance, my army cannot get there, but as you have come to me from a distant country I give you the receipts of the Gwadur customs till such time as you recover your territory. When you have got your territory back, you shall not receive the revenue from the Gwadur customs. Sultan Said having returned, proceeded to Gwadur and took possession of the “ Mahsul” of that place.

I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 542-Con- fidential, and in reply to enclose a memorandum on the History of Gwadur which I have drawn up for inclusion in the Gazetteer of Makran. In addition to the references made in the memorandum, I also enclose copies of the following papers, which form the basis for the conclusions at which I have arrived.' They are :— 1.

The originals of these sanads are in my possession. A genealogical tree of the Gichkis of Kech can he supplied if required. Memorandum on the history of Gwadur. The possession by another State of a petty town and its neighbourhood within the borders of Kalat, the tertitory of which State completely sur rounds it on three sides, must naturally strike the observer as somewhat strange, and as the question of the possession of certain rights in Gwadur by the Sultan of Maskat is of some importance, it will be dealt with here at I some length. It is generally understood that the right of sovereignty in Gwadur was made over by the Khans of Kaiat to Maskat in perpetuity and that from that time the place has remained in the hands of the Sultans of the latter place. That the port was made over to Maskat as a free gift is supported Vide Curzon’s “ Persia,” Volume II, pages 432* by one eminent authority at any 433. rate. This view, however, is far from being accepted by the natives of Baluch istan . The local opinion is very characteristically expressed in an extract which has been made from a diary in the possession of one Mir Mazar Miwam of Malar in Kolwa. It is addressed to the writer’s son and runs as follows “ If somebody asks you whether Gwadur belongs to Kech and how it fell into the hands of the Bu-Saidis of Maskat, tell him in reply that Saiyid Sultan was their ancestor and fled from the country of Maskat at the hands ot his own relations and came to Zik.* Had Karim, Mirwani, accompanied him and went to Kharan and induced Mir Jahangir, Nowsherwam, to join them and they took refuge with Shah Nasir Khan (the first). In the end the Brahui army did not go to Maskat to help Saiyid Sultan, hut at length iKr * Zik is a fortified village belonging to the Mirwanis in Kolwa above Malar.6 i Nasir Khan lent * him Gwadur on trust. Mir Nazir Khan said. “As soon as Maskat is recovered, make over Gwadur to me.” (Mir Nasir Khan). He has not given it back up to this time.” A similar entry is to be traced in a diary kept by the late Mir Abdul Karim, Mirwani, of Manguli Kalat, but he adds that Sheh Omar Gichki was appointed to attend on Saiyid Sultan. This remark is of some importance as enabling us to locate dates. It is also to be remembered that Gwadur has acquired importance only since it passed to Maskat, the chief ports previouslv having been Jiwani and Pasni. (Journal of the Asiatic Societv of Ben^af No. CL1Y, dated 1841, page 802.) * A glance here at the history of the present Maskat dynastv and also of that of the Gichkis will not be out of place. Ahmad-bin-Said, a man of humble origin, founded the A1 bu Saiad dynasty of Maskat in 1741 and reigned 40 years. It is unanimously accepted in Makran that the Sultans of Maskat are descended from the same Albu Saiad, or Bu- Saiad as they are locally called, from whom the Buledais of Kech, to whom a reference will presently he made, are descended. The point is of interest as showing the long connection between Makran and Maskat. Ahmad was suc ceeded in 1783 by Saiad Said, and it was he against whom Saiad Sultan his brother, raised a successful revolution after his sojourn at Gwadur. The exact period of Saiad Sultan’s stay at the latter port is not known, but Boss states that he succeeded in usurping the Sultanate of Maskat in 1797 (Memoran dum on Makran by Captain E. C. Boss, page 38.) , As Mir Nasir Khan died in 1793, and it was during his reign that Saiad Sultan went to Kalat, it would appear that the latter must have been at Gwadur tor at least five years. Saiad Sultan was killed in battle in 1804, and it is un necessary to follow the dynasty farther in this place. It is admitted on all hands in Makran that the Buledais held the reins of power in that country during the 17th century. At the beginning of the 18th century, quarrels arose with the Gichkis. These Gichkis are of Baiput origin and had migrated from India into the Panjgur valley some time before ifere’ they appear to have gained considerable influence chiefly by marriage with the Kowsherwams. Early in the 18 th century one Mnlla Murad, a Pan fur Gbhki broke away from the main stock and made his way to Kech, where he became a r,' that curious sect known as the Zikris or Dais. His accession to the i n faith appears to have given it a considerable impetus, and he very soon expense of The 1 * Bolfda^ ’T' aDd i “ flu ™ ce amon ? bis co-religionists'at the expense ot the Buledais, who were also Zikris.

Now this is the allegation of the Gichkis to this day. They assert that the Gichkis continued to receive their half share of the reuenues of Gwa dur after the possession of the place had been made over to Saiad Sultan. It is said that in those days the revenue amounted to 7,000 Qurash or dollars. They are also known as Rial. At first this sum was distributed into three shares, the Gichki share 3,000 dollars, the Khan of Kalat’s share—retained by the Maskat representative, 3,000 dollars, and the expenses of collection—also taken by Maskat—1,000 dollars. It is alleged by.the Gichkis that their share of 3,000 dollars was regularly paid to them up to the time of one Bibi Mariam, a Buledai lady who was married to Gichki. This lady is described by Ross in 1868 as living on the charity of the Sultans of Maskat, but as a matter of fact, it is asserted by the Gichkis that what she received was hers by right, and represented the balance of the Gichki share of the Gwadur revenues to which they had formerly been entitled, but which had been greatly curtailed by the Sultan, especially in the time of Bibi Mariam. A payment equivalent to about Rs. 37 per annum is made by the Sultan of Maskat to Sardar Shell Omar Gichki to this day. This contention of the Gichkis is supported by Haji Avdun Nabi, who visited Makran under Major Leach’s orders in 1838-39. He says “ the two 1 ports (of Gwadur and Chabar) formerly belonged half to the Grokhees 2 and half to the Brahoees. The Brahoees’ half was uiven in grant by Mir Naseer Khan to the present Imaum’s father, Saiyed Sultan, who took refuge at Kalat during some convulsion in his own State.” Nor is it likely, when we consider Brahui history, that Mir Nasir Khan would have permitted any permanent alienation of territory to another State. The Brahui power was then at its zenith, and Mir Nasir Khan had extended his authority not only into Makran so far as Chabar, but also to Kachhi. The demands of the Chiefs who composed his confederacy were great and it may be reasonably inferred that a permanent alienation of territory which he had acquired at the cost of so much bloodshed 3 would have been far from his thoughts. Nasir Khan was succeeded by a line of weak Khans during whose time Kalat fell into a state of continual turmoil and anarchy. Some of the outlying parts of their kingdom, specially on the west, were lost and they had little time to think of a place such as Gwadur, but the matter was not entirely lost sight of, for it is stated that Mir Nasir Khan II (1840-1858) sent an expedition under Shahgasi Wali Muhammad to Kech, one of the objects of which was to regain possession of the port. It was at this time that in order, apparently, to enable him to retain peaceable possession of the port, the ruler of Maskat sent 15 negro slaves, 5 female slaves, and a sword to Kalat. Some of the slaves are still alive. Shortly afterwards Nasir Khan II died and his successor, Khudadad Khan, during one of the few intervals of peace which occurred during his reign, sent his son to Makran with a similar object. Troubles however, which were caused by the Nowsherwanis of Kharan, prevented the attainment of this object.

I have been asked for an opinion as to the limits of the Sultan of Maskat s territory and as to the desirability of defining them by means of a map. 2 As the Maskat frontier has not been formally demarcated on any side, I can do no more than adduce reasons for considering that certain places are within and others without the Sultan’s jurisdiction. 3. In regard to each doubtful locality we must enquire, firstly, whether the Sultan claims the sovereignty ; secondly, whether the actual inhabitants admit it; and, thirdly, whether any neighbouring authority maintains a rival claim. The best proof of sovereign rights is, cf course, their exercise, as by dispensing justice or collecting taxes. 4 The French view * seems to be that the Sultanate of Maskat extends from the Peninsula * 0 t Katar in the north to the western extremity of Dhofar in the south, and that nowhere between these points is there any breach in the Pasre 18. “Situation speeiale de la ville de continuity of the Sultan's authority.

In 1902 Major Cox reported that “ the Sultan would doubtless, if asked the direct question, claim jurisdiction over the Maklab Isthmus and the Has Mosandim promontory.' In other words, it is clear that Maskat claims the district. » In 1902 Major Cox reported that the Shaikh of Lima in the abstract recognised his subordination to Saiyid Faisal and said that Saiyid Faisal's wishes were law to him. The Dhahuriyin (Zahooriyeen) of the Malcolm Inlet seemed to recognise the ouitan ot Maskat in a patriarchal way and said that if any momentous dispute arose amongst them they would appeal to him. The people of Ktimzar uneqmyocaHy and unhesitatingly acknowledged the sovereignty of the Sultan o Maskat, not over themselves only but over the whole Shihhi tribe, with the exception of a few subject to Kas A1 Khaima.

It is impossible to say how far the Sultan's authority or influence radiates from these inland posts. In any case we must note that the whole valley of Rostak, also called Wadi Fara', from Hazam inclusive upwards, comprising about 30 villages, is in possession of the Sultan s relation Saiyid Sa’id bin Ibrahim bin Kais bin ’ Azzan. The Sultan has married his sister and pays him a subsidy, but the Saiyid is practically independent. Again the Sultan has no posts in 1the inland province of Sharkiya, and it is entirely beyond his control. It is doubtful whether any number of the inhabitants of Sharkiya own even a nominal allegiance to Maskat. 14. If I may offer an opinion on such a point, the French have no right to raise the general question of the Sultan's boundaries on the present reference. It is open to tliem to prove, if they can, that Sur, where most of their flags are held, is outside the Sultan’s dominions. If, however, the British represencative i s required to state what the British Government consider to be the Sultan's limits, he might accompany his statement with a rough map like that attached, the names of the Sultan's inland posts being omitted. J. G. LORIMER. 22nd March 1905.o , Jiaci#©.- From Lieutenant-Colonel Herbert Disbrowe, Political Agent, Muscat, to nt-f? i / % W. H. Havelock, Esq., Officiating Secretary to Government, Bombay,— (No. 44, dated off Stewart Island, the 29th February 1864.) On tlie 23rd and 24th instant I addressed you two letters, Nos. 35 and 39, and conveying, for the information of His Excellency the Governor in Council, particulars of how affairs then stood at our telegraphic station in the Mus- sendom Territory. In continuation of the above letters, I do myself the honor to submit the following additional intelligence :— On the 24th instant Colonel Stewart and myself left Muscat; on the 26th idem we arrived back here, and Colonel Goldsmid, who with exceeding kindness had consented to remain behind for the purpose of watching over our newly-established relations with the Arabs, hastened to rejoin us, and to make known to us that, although nothing could be said in praise of Sooley- man, the Ilubbala'yn Chief personally, but rather the reverse, still the terms we were on with the Arabs generally were not on the whole less satisfactory than when Colonel Stewart and myself had quitted Mukheb for Muscat a few days antecedent. One or two matters had, however, occurred which demanded delicate handling, and which I proceed to relate in detail. The first event refers to the unfriendly demeanour and behaviour of Sooley- man, the Hubbalayn Chief, and it is thus Colonel Goldsmid has described it: Sunday, 21-sL—Sooleyman and Abid came to our camp with a few followers. It was reported to us when sitting in the tent that the two had set upon one of our builders and beaten him. Mr. Philliparoslie stated that, had he not rescued him, he would have suffered severely ; as it was, he was much cut and hurt with hard blows from sticks. We* instantly * Mr. Walton and i, Mr. Huz, &amp;o., &amp;c. rus j ie q ou ^ ant [ the result was a long remonstrance and discussion. Sooleyman argued that, if we took the part of these people, we might lose all our stores, and lie would not be responsible. The men stole and deposited the effects in his village. I gave him to understand that this sort of outrage could not be tolerated, and that, if lie had anything to object, he must say it to the Baliooz, who would soon be here. After long and unsatis factory talk, the two withdrew with their men. I endeavoured to preserve cool temper throughout, and impress upon these men that such an act as they had committed was in our eyes a serious breach of propriety. A man from* ( 2 ) Persian Gulf Telegraph Station at Mussendom. Ivumza, armed with a matchlock slung across his back, whose face was not unknown to me, interfered during the whole affair in a manner which had every appearance of friendliness to us and our position. After this little scene we had quiet for the day. Read service in the said shed to a party of about 15. Gun-hoat returned about fh 1 p. M. Monday, 22/zd— Abid came in the morning. I had already instructed the moonshee to say that I was displeased at the behaviour of these Chiefs yesterday ; so much so, that I had rather not talk to them in our camp, Or that they come here at alL _ If they wishc djto see me. I would iro jmd meet them on board Victoria, which could draw near the shore if accessary. He went away annoyed, as I was told, and said something about writing to Khussab and Kumza. Tuesday, 2%rd. —Abid appeared again in the morning, bringing a sick old man for treatment. I went up close to him without recognizing him, as he had left of his turban and wore a scull cap. Finding who it Was and the mission on which he had come, I thought it better to relax so far as to say a » Using the wort taba,” obedient. '’ 0rd * and t0 take tlle ° ld m!m t0 Mr - Campbell. Abid made some remark* and touched his head, evidently intending that lie was submissive; whether sincere or not, I cannot say: the moonshee was of opinion “ that he is thoroughly sorry at what has occurred.” This concludes the description of the first event. I proceed now to relate the second event, and think it best to subjoin Colonel Goldsmid’s version of this also; Colonel Goldsmid has described it as follows — JVednesday, Mth.—A strip of paper was brought to-day, of which the following seems a tolerably correct version :— From Hamed bin Mahomed and Alee bin Rashid and all the Bedouins, to His Excellency the Syed Baliooz. Greeting. “We inform you that the Bedouins came to you and Remark. This letter, though me- received nothing, and it is not our pleasure that nacing in its tone, is likely enough a begging letter more than anything else. (Sd.) H.

And Sooleyman and Abid and Hamid cannot keep the Bedouins from you, nor can the people of Khussab do so; give us something, or your abode is The messenger who brought it has been told by the moonshee that lie could not read it; but I thought it better to say plainly if he wanted an answer, he had better await the arrival of the Baliooz, to whom it was addressed, and who was daily expected. He said he was going to Mukhukoo, and would return m the mormmr. D (Sd.) F. J.

After consultation with Colonel (TOldsmid, I gave the messenger a verbal reply to the effect that, if the Bedouin Unets who had deputed him were desirous of conferring with me on anv subject, I should be happy to receive a visit from them on board Her Maiesty’s V essel Coromandel. J JPersian Gulf Telegraph Station at Mussendom. The messenger thereupon departed, and up to the present instant nothing- further has been heard either of him or of the Chiefs who sent him. I pass now to the consideration of our position at Muklub as viewed in a general % light, and on this subject I am happy to have it in my power to state that, so ^ far as present appearances warrant my pronouncing an opinion, matters are looking up and our prospects are brightening. In recording the above opinion, however, I beg it may distinctly be understood that I by no means intend to imply that the necessity for' dis patching a royal navy vessel to these parts has been altered or removed. The necessity, 1 consider, still continues, for, in the first place, appearances, as is well known, are oftentimes deceitful, and, in the second place, there are not wanting indications to keep up in my mind the impression that the presence here of a vessel of war would be invaluable as a check upon the evil propensi ties of the Arabs. It should be remembered too, I respectfully submit, that this is the first occasion, the very commencement I may say, of British intercourse with the wild Arabs residing in these regions.' Colonel Stewart will, I trust, within ten days, be leaving this place for Bushire and Bussorah, and I purpose remaining a short time after his departure with a view to watch how matters progress and to strive and conciliate the Arabs': I shall further endeavour cautiously to collect reliable information respecting the tribes around, who they are subject to, and so forth. I cannot think of closing this despatch without recording the valuable, assistance I have derived from Colonel F. J. Goldsmid on all occasions and on all matters of importance since my arrival here from Muscat. The value of the advice I have received from him has been enhanced by the cordiality with which it has been accorded. From Lieutenant-Colonel Herbert Disbrowe, Political Agent, Muscat, to W. H. Havelock, Esq., Officiating Secretary to Government, Bombay,— (No. 85, dated the 22nd February 186L) Ox the 27th ultimo I made known to Her Majesty’s Government that I had just returned from the Mussendom Districts, to which I had proceeded on duty connected with the sub-marine telegraph ; on the same date I forwarded transcript of a roughly-written and hastily-prepared letter I had addressed to Colonel Patrick Stewart on the subject of my visit. There were points, however, I observed in one of my letters, that required particular notice, but which, owing to the want of time, I was unable to do more than cursorily touch upon. I proceed accordingly to rectify the omission, and do myself the honor to submit the following observations for the information of His Excellency the Governor in Council:— 2. Muklub, the spot discovered last year by Lieutenant Stifle, and fixed upon within the last few days by Colonel Stewart for our short telegraphic land line, lies between the villages of Hubbalayn and Mukhukoo in Malcolm’s Inlet. The Mussendom. Districts, including Khussab, are held to be under the sole authority of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat. My surprise, therefore, was not inconsiderable on the 11th ultimo, when I heard remarks which created in my mind doubts as to the correctness of the opinion hitherto enter tained and recorded regarding the boundary of His Highness’s possessions in Mussendom. I was seated on the above date conversing with Sooleyman, the Sheik of Hubbalayn, and I learnt from him that the Hubbalaynites pretend to acknowledge Shiek Sultan bin Saggur, the Joasmee Chief, as their lord, and not His Highness the Sultan of Muscat. To the above observation on thePersian Gulf Telegraph Station at Mussendom. part of Sooleyman, the Chief, I merely stated, in reply, that I was acquainted with the Joasmee Chief, and that he is on terms of friendship with the British Government. At the same time I inwardly felt that, if it he really true that Huhbalayn is subject to the Joasmees, and not to Muscat, discussions might possibly hereafter arise with reference to our cable ; and this anxiety it was that led me to notify the circumstance to Government in my letter above referred to, though time was not at my disposal to enter into details on the subject: Muklmkoo, the second village specified, is distant from Hubbalayn some two miles by sea and three miles by land, is a place of occasional resort for the inhabitants of lluhbalayn, and is, in fatty under thu am hoi-ity ot the Onief of Hubbalayn: Muklub, situated as it is between, and in close proximity to, the villages named, is, therefore, in like manner, subject to the Chief of Hubbalayn. Although from the manner in which Sooleyman made known to me that he considers himself a subject of Sheik Sultans I thought there might be some truth in the statement he advanced, I felt by no means disposed to credit the story until I had cautiously instituted enquiries on the subject. Without, therefore, appearing to attach much importance to the fact of whose depend ants the Hubbalaynites might really prove to be, I commenced endeavouring to investigate the matter. One of my guides, a native of the Bunder Abbas Districts,'assured me that the Hubbalaynites were “ lying ” (I make use of his own expression), and that they are the subjects of the Sultan of Muscat. The Wallee of Khussub repeatedly maintained that they are such, and went so far on one occasion, I understand, as to make statement to that effect in the very presence of Sooleyman, which statement Sooleyman did not attempt to refute. Matters standing thus, and perceiving no means of obtaining reliable inform ation on the spot, I at last determined to put the question. direct to His Highness Syed Soweynee in writing, without, however, mentioning that the people of Hubbalayn claim to be exempt from His Highness’s authority. Copy and translation of the correspondence that has up to the present moment passed on this subject I do myself the honor to enclose with this letter. It will be seen therefrom that His Highness distinctly claims Kims sab, Muklub, and the places in their neighbourhood as forming a portion of his dominions. Unless, therefore, the Joasmee Chief puts forth counter-claims to Muklub, I see no‘cause for any difficulties or obstacles arising with reference to tele graphic communication across the isthmus dividing Elphinstone’s Inlet from Malcolm’s Inlet. If, on the other hand, counter-claims be advanced by the Joasmee Chief, I see no wiser course than to purchase out and out, in behalf of the Sultan of Muscat, from the Joasmee, the rights the latter pretends to possess over the locality, and subsequently to deal solely with His Highness Syed Soweynee. I hope, however, no such necessity will occur. * For a time, say the next two or three months to come, Telegraphic Officers and Establishment will be located at Muklub and will require protection. (Sd.) H. D. 3. Muklub is a rocky, desert piece of ground, inconveniently distant from water, inconveniently distant from resources, and there is no intention, I believe, to utilize the spot for any* permanent purpose save that of burying our cable across it from one inlet to the other and constructing upon it a land line. Khussab, and not Muklub, is to be the Telegraphic Station, and so I gather from Colonel Stewart, all we expect from the people of Hubbalayn and Mukhukoo is that they should refrain from interfering with and should protect the cable and land wire; that they should from time to time inspect the cable at its shore ends, covering any portion that may accidentally be laid bare, and finally, that they should immediately report to the Telegraphic Establishment at Khussab any injury or accident that may have occurred to either cable or wire. To ensure the attainment of these objects it will, of course, be necessary for us to conciliate the Chief and his dependants, and this, in their case, canWej 15 ^lit J it was s r above kon tie ^ala?n ttmk iwiiiiii ; y to, tfe WayiL ■otliatlie its some ifedit tie Vitlioit, e depend- eavourinj et Alb useoflis n.

On this matter, however, Colonel Stew art and myself purpose reporting more definitely and more in detail hereafter. 4* There is a vast difference, I must confess, between the manners and bearing of the Hubbalaynites and Khussabites; the latter are civil and respectful in the extreme, and are under a Chief who has had some intercourse with the English. The Hubbalaynites, on the other hand, are perfectly unci vilized, and Sooleyman, their Chief, appears grasping and uncouth to a degree. To judge from his physiognomy and what 1 know of him, he is an unkind barbarian. Abid, his brother, however, is a better specimen of humanity, and is certainly more tractable. When I visited Hubbalayn last month I resided amongst its inhabitants for a number of days, and I ascertained that, although Lieutenant Stiffe had visited Muklub and other places in the neighbourhood the year previous, 1 am the first Englishman who has actually landed at this particular spot, Hubbalayn. I further gathered from enquiry that out of thirty-four persons seated around me two only had seen or spoken to an Eng lishman ; in short, the Arabs about Muklub, he they subjects of the Sultan of Muscat, or he they subjects of the Joasmee Chief, are decidedly a wild set, and should anything occur to cause them serious displeasure, I can readily imagine they would he disposed to be unscrupulously mischievous. Unde fined notions of the powers of the English, coupled with the dread of losing their fishing-boats, which appears to be the only property they prize, would be the sole available restraint upon their action. All things considered, there fore, I venture strongly to counsel the immediate dispatch from the presi dency of a vessel of war to protect and ensure respect to our officers and establishment temporarily employed among these uncivilized barbarians. Were it possible for a Royal Navy Vessel to be stationed off Muklub for a time, say two or three months, I feel assured that the effect would be invaluable, and that the objects above indicated would he thus fully attained without the risk of complications. So far as I can judge, there would be no necessity, on the contrary, it would be rather unadvisable, for her crew to go much on shore or to mix themselves with the natives. Her presence wmuld act as a salutary check upon the Arabs if inclined to be annoying or mischievous, and her protection would be available to us if actually necessary. 5. I conclude by observing that many of the suggestions contained in this letter are made after consultation with Colonel Patrick Stewart, who, no doubt, will also fnrnisli a Report. 6. A copy of this despatch will be forwarded in due course to Colonel Pelly, Acting Political Resident at Bushire, and as I purpose returning imme diately to Mussendom, it is my intention presently to submit further particu lars to Her Majesty’s Government. From Lieutexant-Colonel Herbert Disbrowe, Political Agent, Muscat, to His Highness Syed Soweynee, Sultan of Muscat,— (dated the 20th February 1864.) With reference to my letter under date the 6th instant, I do myself the honor to make known to your Highness that I have returned from Malcolm’s Inlet. 2. The following particulars may be of interest to your Highness :— 3. The submarine cable has, thank God, been successfully laid as far as Muklub, the narrowest point of the isthmus between the village of Hubba layn and Mukhukoo, and telegraphic communication thence with India has already commenced. 2I?6rsian Gulf Telegraph Station at Mussendom. 1.

Muklub will be utilized merely for the construe* | tion ot* a short land line, and no officers will be stationed there, the position bein- painfully arid and in other respects unsuitable. It will, how* ever, be necessary thoroughly to provide for the protection of the land line and the extremities of the submarine cable landed on either side of Muklub, and ns itV desirable, jdth a view to this olyect, to enter mto certain arrrange- ments with the inhabitants of the spot, I shall feel obliged by your High* ness informing me, for the purposes of official record, whether Muklub, together with the other two villages above named, form part of your Highness s dominions, and further, whether we possess your Highness’s permission to carry out the arrangements above referred to, 5. Colonel Patrick Stewart and Sir Charles Bright accompanied me from Malcolm’s Inlet to this port, and are anxious to do themselves the honor of paving their respects to your Highness. II ill your Highness be kind enough to acquaint me when it will be convenient to receive them. From His Highness Syed Soweynee, Sultan of Muscat, to Lieutenant Colonel Herbert Discrowe, Political Agent, Muscat,-(dated the 12th Ramjan 1280, 21st February 1861.) I have received and understood your letter. I was delighted at vottr return; was also delighted to hear that the tele graph has reached Muklub ; may it ever continue in good condition. You have written regarding Muklub, Khussab, and their neighbourhood ; these nre all my country and my dependants ; no one has any concern with them. You write you want to make arrangements with the people of those parts, hut you do not explain the particulars, though they are my subjects and depen dants. If you possess any intention, you should explain. Regarding the telegraphic buildings, you have my permission to con struct them wherever you desire in those parts. Colonel Stewart, you inform me, proposes to erect the buildings at Khussab ; I am of opinion that Khussab is a desirable spot for the purpose. Hegarding the visit of Colonel Stewart and Sir Charles Bright, please God. I shall be prepared to receive them to-morrow, and will send word when I am ready.

Fiom Lieutenant-Colonel Herbert D isbrowe, Political Agent, Muscat, to W. H. Havelock, F2sq., Officiating Secretary to Government, Bombay,— (No. 39. dated the 24th February 186L) It has struck me that in my letter, No. 35, dated yesterday, I have, perhaps, scarcely expressed myself with sufficient clearness and force regarding the temperament of the Hubbalaynites and Mukhukooites ; I do myself the honor, therefore, to submit the following additional observations 2. I lived, as already made known, among the Hubbalaynites for a number of days antecedent to the arrival of the telegraphic vessels with the^Persian Gulf Telegraph Station at Mussendom. cable, and I bad then, and have had since, good opportunities of observing their inclinations and characters. I might enter into a lengthy description of little incidents and occurrences that have taken place, but time does not admit of my furnishing details. 3. I shall confine myself, therefore, to recording the impressions that have been created in my mind by my visits, and these arc, that the Hubbalaynites and Mukhukooites are destitute of the good qualities that generally characterize the Arabs : the only qualities I have, indeed, been able to discover among them are lying, cunning, avarice, thieving, and mischief. 4. Hospitality and civility appear unknown among them, and their Chief, Sooleyman, seems to be the greatest villain of all. in short, although it is but fair that I should record the fact of myself, my servants, my horse, and my property having been in the midst of them unguarded and yet unmolested for a number of days recently, still I am aware that thefts have since been committed on property belonging to the telegraph, and I feel assured that nothing but fear restrains them from being openly mischievous, I might almost say violent. 5. I venture, therefore, strongly to reiterate the opinion I expressed in my letter above adverted to, that the presence of a man-of-war is imperatively necessary to ensure protection and respect to our officers and establishment . temporarily employed at Muklub. From C. Gonne, Esq., Officiating Secretary to Government, Bombay, to Lieutenant-Colonel H. F. Disbrowe, Political Agent, Muscat,— (No. 660, dated the 8tli March 1864-.) X am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letters, dated the 22nd and 24th ultimo, Nos. 35 and 39, submitting observations in connection w ith your recent visit to Mussendom, and suggesting that a vessel ot war be dis patched for the protection of the telegraph party employed at Muklub. 2. In communicating the approval of Government of your proceedings, I am desired to state that orders have been issued for the dispatch of the Gun-boat Hugh Rose to Mussendom, and His Excellency the Governor m Council trusts that the presence of this vessel will afford adequate protection to the telegraph party and stores in that neighbourhood, and assist in main taining the authority of His Highness the Imauin of Muscat so far as it legitimately extends. 3 On this latter point I am to observe that it does not appear that the Joasmee Chief lias preferred any claim to sovereignty over Hubbalayn. The Imaum will doubtless assert his rights if questioned by the Sheik oi Hubba layn, but meanwhile you should request His Highness to take measures to ensure all his subjects in the vicinity doing whatever Colonel Stewart may require of them for the protection of the wire. 4. With a view, however, to secure the cheerful co-operation of these people in carrying out His Highness’s intentions, you should, after consulting the Imaum orTthe subject, inform Colonel Stewart wdiat arrangement you would recommend for the attainment of this important object, whether it be the payment of regular allowance or otherwise. 5 In conclusion, I am desired to state that, pending the ariival of the Huqh Rose, the Hon’ble the Governor in Council is inclined to think that His Hi°hness the Imaum could provide, by means ol his men and vessels sent to Khussab, for the safety of the persons and property belonging to the telegraph at that place.1 NOVEMBER 1887. —Uo* 68.

Ross, C.S.I., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and Her Majesty's Consul-General for Ears. I have the honour to report that Seyyids Eeysal, Fahad, and Nasir bin Mohammed, who had proceeded in the “ Sultani ” to Khasab, returned on the 30th ultimo after having effected peace between the Beni Hidiyyeh and the Kamzara of that place, and exacted a fine of 500 dollars from each of the two tribes as a punishment for the murder of one of the men belonging to the Wali of Khasab. A salute having been fired on their arrival, I sent a congratula tory message to His Highness the Sultan. 2. I have further the honour to report, for your information, that Seyyid Abdul Azeez has left Semed and gone on a visit to Shaikh Saleh bin Ali, but the object of their meeting has not yet become known. His Highness the Sultan, however, does not seem to attach any importance to it. 3. I have the honour to forward herewith copies of three Arabic letters containing the news of Seyyid Abdul Azeez’s movements. Translated purport of a letter from Jooma bin Saeed bin Ali to His Highness Seyyid Toorkee bin Saeed, dated 5th October 1887. After compliments —I have sent you several letters before this, containing the news of this part, and nothing new has since occurred, excepting that on the 15th of this month your brother Abdul Azeez arrived at Bidiyyeh. God knows what their intention is; at present I have not heard positively of it. But should their object become apparent to me hereafter, I shall inform you of it. You will receive all the other new-s about the Sharkiyeh from your servant. Salaams from Jooma bin Saeed bin Ali. 70.

At present their secret is not known, hut we are watching them, and if they do anything we shall inform you of it. Do not entertain any doubt about us. If you wish us to rise against them we are ready, and whatever you wish may God cause it to happen.

Abdul Azeez has arrived on a visit to Shaikh Saleh, and has brought with him some men of the Haboos, the Harth, and the Hijreein; they have been received with a salute of guns. Their intention is to go to Bidiyyeh and probably to get up a rising. Since then a Hinawi has come and informed me of their object which you know; and when I became sure of their movements I could not remain any longer in the Sharkiyeh.

I have the honour to forward herewith copy and translation of a letter to . my address, from His Highness Seyyid Abdul Aziz, received by me on the 12th instant just as the mail was leaving; also copy of my reply thereto. 2 - 1 also forward copy and translation of a letter from Shaikh Saleh-bin-Ali al Harthee, to His Highness Seyyid Eeysal, acknowledging him as ruler and pro mising not to rise with Seyyid Abdul Aziz against him; this letter was accom panied by a joint letter from Shaikhs Juma-bin-Saeed and Essa-bin-Rashid (of the Masakareh) who acted as intermediaries between Seyyid Feysal and Shaikh Saleh, and whose intervention may perhaps give somewhat more value to Shaikh Saleh s promises than they would, judging from all former experience, otherwise merit; but I shall still be surprised if he does not, before any very long interval, find some excuse for throwing off the garment of friendship and submission which he declares that he has now put on. * 3* The Masakareh Shaikhs mentioned in their letter that Seyyid Muham- mad-hin-Masood (Al Bu Saeedee), the learned Kazi and Governor of Manah, was shortly expected at Semad; he was in Muscat at the time of the death of His Highness Seyyid Turki, and I am told that his voice has been enlisted by His Highness Seyyid Eeysal in his behalf, and if really exerted in his favour will doubtless much strengthen his position. 4. On the 13th instant, letters were received from the Wali and towns folk of Awabee; the former stated that the townsfolk were in league with an Agent of Seyyid Ibrahim-bin-Keis named Ibrahim-bin-Saeed (Al Ibree) to deliver the place up to him, which he, the Wali, frustrated by his watchfulness and had since destroyed the water-courses of the townspeople as a punishment. The townspeople in their letter complained that they were being unjustly pun ished, and that the affair was got up by the Wali out of spite to Ibrahim-bin- Saeed, whom he had seized and imprisoned. His Highness Seyyid Eeysal direct ed the Wali to allow the people to repair their water-courses and wrote to Seyyid Muhammad-bin-Bedr, Wali of Nakl, to proceed to Awabee and enquire into the affair. 5. On the 22nd instant news was received that Seyyid Ibrahim-bin-Keis was on the point of starting to attempt the seizure of Awabee. Seyyid Eeysal wrote to the Ibreeyeen to help Awabee and to the Wali of Nakl to assist if pos sible ; but it is said that Seyyid Ibrahim-bin-Keis when he intervened between the Miyayihah and Ibreeyeen as reported in my No. 225, dated 30th July 1888, gained over the Ibreeyeen to his own interests, and they will now probably hold aloof, it may be remembered that the Ibreeyeen formerly held Awabee in the interests of Seyyid Ibrahim, and that it was they who made it over to His Highness the late Seyyid Turki. 1 »FOREIGN DEPARTMENT, E 35-30 Oman Affairs. 6.

Mockler, Poll, tical Agent, Muscat, dated the 1st Zil-Haj 1305=1 Uth August 1888. After compliments. —We have received your honoured letter, dated 12th Zil-Kaada, and you say that it appears to you that the “ meaning intended to be conveyed by Colonel Ross is that the British Government desire that the people of Oman may live in peace and prosperity under rulers elected by them selves, and that the Government would co-operate towards the attainment of that happy state of affairs.” Learn that if the people of Oman had regulations or even sense to under stand the advantages and honour and ease which would accrue to them from the choosing by them of rulers who would strengthen the pillars of their king dom, improve their country, attend to the welfare of the people and andeavour to direct them for their good, as is the custom amongst other peoples. They would doubtless be in the greatest prosperity and peace, such as is the desire of the great Government; but between the desire of the English Government and the condition of the people of Oman there is a great difficulty; for, what are the people of Oman except miserable animals who follow any one who calls to them, who turn with every breeze, wdio are unillumed by the light of learning and have not through sought it the safety of a strong prop ? then how can one expect them to have the knowledge and ability to choose fit rulers ? verily they only flee from rulers and from laws as they would from a lion, and truly their highest desire is that one should rule over them, who is weak in intellect, poor in judgment, and without energy, who will neither command nor forbid, so that each one may be a separate ruler, and engage in strife and the spreading of discord, that there shall be no one to stop them, that the strong may oppress the weak; then will the land and its stock be ruined, and such are their doings at present (may God’s wrath not overtake them !). I ask, how can there be expected from people in such a condition good deeds, and the choosing of rulers fit to guide them ? It is absurd —absurd to expect such from them—for they are utterly wanting in good deeds and integrity, but by nature imbued with evil and strife. And when I saw that matters had come to this pass from the abundance of strife and the growing boldness of lawless persons, I perceived that the resus- * This means a return to the unpleasant Metowa citation of the law of God and the SUp- res,me - pression* of innovations, the restraining ol the tyrant and protection of the oppressed, the direction of the people to well doing and endeavours to secure their tranquillity and that of the country, are the deeds which will give one most propinquity to God, and are the duty of everyone who has the power under God’s assistance. And it is impossible for mo to accomplish the reforms I desire at this time admits the jesting of fools except by the sword (if one has only the point of a spear to ride on, one must ride on it); therefore when the English Government understands my desires and intentions and sees that I have drawn the sword to accomplish them, thev will certainly excuse me since they will know that I only desire what is right and to improve the condition of Oman, and do away with the tyranny and disturb ances prevailing in it, concerning which the Government is perfectly informed and it is impossible to suppose that the English Government, which is one of the most glorious and is the greatest of civilized powers, should in the case of a people who have reached the point of ignorance and stupidity and wretchedness that the people ot Oman have now, and it is able to turn them into another path, and give assistance for their benefit, be anything except desirous to hasten to do so, certainly so as the people of Oman are their neighbours and very much. tOCTOBER 1888.

I have the honour to report that on the 2nd September Awabi was surren dered to Seyyid Ibrahim bin Keis, after, I believe, a stout resistance, in which the son of the Akid Ali bin Seif El-ibri was killed. The Ibriyeen, as I report ed would most likely be the case, made no attempt to relieve it, having un doubtedly been won over by Seyyid Ibrahim beforehand. 2. On the 31st August and 3rd September I had interviews with His Highness Seyyid Eeysal in the course of which he stated that he did not intend to remain quiet in Muscat as his father had done, that he considered it the duty of him who assumed government to risk his life to uphold his authority, and that he intended to attack Rostak after the 10th of Muharram (17th Sep tember) and had already written to the tribes to assemble at Burka. Some of the Hishm Beni Bu-Ali and Shikeyl have already come in and he has sent vari ous war materials in his yacht J)ar as Salaam under Seyyid Hamad bin Nasir with some Arabs to reinforce the garrison to Burka. 3.

Attached to this note are translations of six letters received at different times from the Saltan between 1891 and 1905, all showing his steadfast desire that the British Government should look after his interests in connection with the Trench flag question. I will briefly comment of the several enclosures— No. 1, dated 11th June 1891, to Political Agent, Mashat. Needs no special comment. No 2, dated 28th May 1897, to Political Agent, Maskat. Needs no special comment. No. 3, Communication, dated 16th May 1900, Political Agent, Maskat&gt; to Foreign Department. So far as His Highness was concerned he was ready to sign the draft letter but before taking it from him finally, it seemed advisable to ask Government if they desired any emendations before he signed it. Before any reply was received on this point the Sultan had proceeded to Soor and had met with a convenient opportunity of acting for himself, and after that the need for sub mitting his letter formally to Government ceased to exist. Since my arrival at Maskat a few days ago the draft letter, which is in the handwriting of the Sultan’s clerk, was shown and read to His Highness, together with the originals of the other letters of which translations are attached, and he unhesitatingly signified his recollection of them and his acceptation of them at the present date and for purposes of the Hague Tribunal. This communication can, therefore, be used with the others if necessary, but if we do use it, we must remember to explain that, before Government had an opportunity of replying, Seyyid Feisal had proceeded to Soor and the Flagholders had agreed to discard their French Articles and accordingly it was never answered. Now, however, that we have got the letter forming enclosure 2s o. 6, and dated 19th March 1905, perhaps the other letters will be superfluous. No. 4. This letter forwarded a long communication from the Sultan to Monsieur Laronce, enlarging on the injustice of the action of the French Government in the matter of the flags. A copy was forwarded to the Government of India with Maskat No. 460 of 30th November 1901, to gether with the French Consul’s reply and the Sultan’s further rejoinder, in which, it is important to note, His Highness gave the direct lie to the statement alleged to have been made by him to Commodore Kiesel, vide Part II, page 10 of French case.

The above was a reminder with reference to the conversation in pursuance of which the Political Agent addressed to the Political Resident his two letters of 8th and 14th March 1891 forming enclosures 7 and 8, Appendix 7 of British Statement. Translated purport of a letter from His Highness the Sultan of Maskat to the Political Agent Maskat, dated 25th Dil Haj 1314, 28th May 1897. After compliments ,—We have to inform you that some of our subjects inhabitants of Soor and its neighbourhood and of the Batineh who are going to and returning from the African coasts and from Aden in their vessels, obtain from the representatives of the Great French Government flags (for their boats) of that Government on the grounds that they possess land and reside (in French territories) and thereby by obtaining French flags find a means to conceal their real object which is well known. We maintain that a person is subject of his country of origin and is free to buy or sell in all places, but by doing this he cannot change his nationality even when he resides or possesses property (in Foreign country). In all countries there are men of different nationalities and even though they have children born in such country, they cannot change their nationality by reason of their staying in such foreign land, unless they remain in the country where they have become naturalized. The above is contrary to law and detrimental to our interest, and it has therefore become incumbent upon us to write to ask the help and consideration of the Great Government in putting an end to the difficulty mentioned. We are overwhelmed with the great favours of Government and we thank them and you for kindnesses accorded to us. And Salaam, Copy of above was forwarded to the Government of India in the Foreign Department with Maskat No. 169 of 2nd June 1897. [ Despatched by mail via Jask. ] Telegram, dated the 16th May 1900. From—The Political Agent, Maskat, To —Foreign Secretary, Calcutta. “ 1 have the honour to address you regarding the matter of the French Rags which are handed about among my subjects, inhabitants of Soor and elsewhere. You are cognizant of the circumstances of the case and we have many times discussed the question, and I am much vexed with regard to it as it is detrimental both to my independence and to my prestige. Moreover, quite lately, as you are probably aware, there has been quarrelling amongst sections o my subjects over this matter, in that the tribe of Hijre-ee called Upon the J ennebeh inhabitants of Soor in a threatening missive to return their French papers and I fear that harm may result. I nevei cease to be distracted by this matter of the French flags and I have many times called upon the French Consul to represent the matter to his Government and to explain to them my wishes and to obtain from them a plain answer . but up to the present I have obtained nothing tangible from him, and the practice has not been put an end to. Now I am aware that it is the custom lor political questions between your two great Governments in these parts to be discussed and settled by communication between high officials of your respective Governments in Europe. I therefore now write to say that if your Great Gov -ernment can see its way to discuss the question with the great French Govern ment on my behalf with a view to effecting the removal of the flags, now in use, and the discontinuance of the practice for the future, I shall be extremely grateful and obliged.” Copy of the above was also forwarded to the Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, with Maskat No. 260 of 16th May 1900.

FEISAL BIN TURKI. Dated Maskat, 11th Moharram 1323. 19th March 1905.5 Memorandum regarding the history of the Khoja Community now in Oman. With reference to the observations made in regard to them at the end of Fart IV of the French Case where they are referred to as “ Les Louwatiya.” , The Indian namefor persons of this sect is Khoja,” but in Maskat they are generally known as ‘^Louwatias ” or “ Hyderabadis,” owing to the fact that many of them are migrants from Hyderabad, Sind. A few also hail from Kutch or other parts of Kattywar. The name Khoja is hardly heard at all % in Maskat either among the people themselves or the general public; they are generally denominated in local correspondence and office petitions as “ Hydera- badis.” The sect is of Hindu origin, hut were probably converted to Muham madanism in some form during the paramountcy of the Kalhora Dynasty in Sind about 400 years ago. A general history of the Maskat Khojas was compiled in 1881 by Colonel S. B. Miles, then Political Agent at Maskat, and the substance of his report was included in printed compilation of the Govern ment of India known as “ Narrative of Maskat Affairs, 1869 to 1893 ” It is important to note that the whole community reside in an enclosed fort or enclosure in Mutrah which is recognised as their peculiar property, and in which no one else is permitted to reside. This so-called “ Khoja Port ” dates from the times when there was no security in Mutrah from Bedouin attacks, and when it was consequently necessary for any alien person or collec tion of persons to take adequate measures for the protection of themselves and their property. The religion and customs of the community differ widely from those of the Beazi Omanis, among whom they live. Much of their ritual, their code of laws, especially in connection with succession and landed property are peculiar to themselves, and they do not submit in such matters, to the Mullahs of Omen, but have their own distinct representatives. Both in India and elsewhere, however, the sect has been much disinte grated by various internal schisms, and in India so much so that in lb78 a Commission was appointed for the purpose of investigating “ the customs and views of both divisions of the Khoja sect in the Presidency of Bombay and elsewhere,” and this resulted in 1884 in a Draft Bill being framed of which a copy was sent to the Political Agent at Maskat with the request that he would obtain the opinion of the Khoja community in Maskat on the proposed Foreign Department letter No. 1931-E., dated Bill. The whole Community Was doubt- the 26th July 1874. less here referred to whether of Maskat or British Nationality, and I merely mention the correspondence here to demon strate how distinct a community the Khojas of Maskat are from the rest of the population, and how closely their affairs are bound up with those of their co religionists in India. In consideration of the above facts it seems only natural and logical that we should have arranged with the rulers of Oman that that section of the com munity which had migrated to Maskat, after the Annexation of Sind in 1843, should be considered as under the protection of the British Government. It is important to note here that at other ports in these waters whether it be Persia or the Pirate Coast a Khoja is, as a matter of course, regarded as a British Subject, that is to say there is no question of the date of his arrival, the mere fact that he is of the Khoja sect is taken as sufficient evidence of his British nationality just as much as if he were a Hindu banian. In brief, therefore, it will be seen that we only claim as British subjects those who came to Oman after the annexation of Sind, and the copies of past correspondence which I attach will demonstrate how strictly we have adhered to that position. I will now proceed to deal seriatim with the several statements on the subject of Khojas which we find at the end of Part IV of the French Case.6 (t/) The Case of Fadl bin Mihram (or Meeran). The Maskat records at present available do not go back beyond I860, and I cannot trace the original record of the case, but copies of letters which passed on the subject have been found in another correspondence and they bear date 14th Shawal 1274, corresponding to the English date 1858. It would appear from a memorandum written by the Revd. G. P. Badger in charge of the Maskat-Zanztfbar Commission, under his No. 11 of 6th June 1861, that different instructions had previously been issued by Captain Pelix ' Jones, then Resident in the Persian Gulf, on the general subject of the protec- tion of Khojas or others in Maskat, but the orders conveyed in the two letters accompanying were evidently issued under authority and have since formed the basis of our treatment of Khojas in Maskat. They are in themselves a complete answer to the French reference to the case Eadl Mihram (or Meeran). (b) I have not been able to trace any correspondence on this subject during the sultanates of Seyyid Salim bin Thoweynee or the Imam Azzan, but it is evident from the enclosures that before their time, the matter had been placed on a basis which was quite definite and well understood. (c) Seyyid Turki was indeed in all matters more friendly and amenable in his relations with the British, but there is nothing on record to support the French statement that during his reign there was any fresh or special transfer of Khojas to the British flag, nor does such a proceeding seem possible in view of the clear definition on which the Political Agent had instructions to work. (d) It is impossible that Colonel Miles could have published such a noti- ficatipn. No such notification can be traced and no doubt the French remarks in this connection refer to the one of the ordinary annual or periodical notices directing British subjects to register themselves. I may mention that such notices have been found to be of little use here. The population of Maskat varies very little, British protected persons or families are well known both to the Consulate and to the local authorities, but they will not come forward in response to a notice of the kind under reference, and pay the fee necessary for the acquirement of a fresh registration paper. In making this observation I refer to all British protected persons whether they be Khojas or Hindoo banians. The 3 difficulty is generally and conveniently met by the Political Agent levying the fee the next time the defaulting individual has requisition to the Consular Office or Court. (&lt;?) I am not aware that His Highness Seyyid Faisal has ever made any protest on the subject of the protection by us of the Khojas to the extent that we have always done. • //) figures given regarding the numbers and nationalities of the Khoja at Gwadur and Maskat are inaccurate and misleading. Taking Maskat first I may mention that I went into the matter when preparing a note on Maskat for the Foreign Department in connection with the visit of His Excel lency the Viceroy to Maskat. At that time I stated the number of Khojas under British protection in Maskat to be about 500 souls. Fresh inquiries have been made since my arrival here a few days ago with the following result. There are stated to be 1,050 souls altogether on the Khoja quarter, of these 250 are adult males and the remainder women and children. Of the 250 males only 120 (approximately) are entitled to British protection together with their families. Ihe remainder (130 males with their families) are subjects of the Sultam. It will be seen therefore that my previous estimate was approxi mately correct, but if anything somewhat over the mark. r at J n ^ wa ^ ur P os fii° n °f the Khojas is on a different basis from that or Maskat. Gwadur, it must he remembered, has only been an appanage of the Muscat bultanate for a little more than 100 years, the port having been presented to the present Sultan’s forbear, Seyyid Sultan bin Ahmed, by the Kian ot Kakelat. All the Khojas there are comparatively recent arrivals: on^iloots as a rule from Karachi and Sind families with whom they live in close and constant social and commercial intercourse.8 Original specimen of Notification issued by Political Agent and His Britannic Majesty's Consult Muscatt re registration of British Subjects. PUBLIC NOTICE. Every British Subject now residing within the dominions of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat is hereby directed to apply to Her Britannic Majesty’s Consul to he enrolled in the Begisfer Book of British Subjects. Likewise all natives of British protected States in India who may claim British protection. All such persons now residing in Muscat or Mutrah must appear for registration within one month from this date. Those residing in other parts of the Sultan’s dominions within three months from this date. Ail persons not previously enrolled must produce two respectable British Subjects to attest their claims to British protection. Every British Subject who may arrive within the said dominions (except British Subjects borne on the Muster Boll of any British ship arriving in any port of Muscat) shall within five days after his arrival also apply to the Consul to be enrolled in such Begister. Any British Subject who shall refuse or neglect to obey this order, and who shall not excuse such refusal of neglect to the satisfaction on the Consul shall not be entitled to be recognised or protected as a British Subject in respect to any suit, dispute or difficulty in which he may have been or may he engaged or involved within the dominions of the Sultan of Muscat at any time when he shall not have been or shall not he so enrolled. C. E. BOSS, Major, Political Agent 8f His Britannic Majesty's Consul. Muscat : ) The 18th January 1872. ) No. 1465-P., dated the 19th May 1875. From—-C. W. AitchisoJH, Esq., Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. With reference to your letter No. 109-32, dated 30th January, I am directed to request that answers to the following questions may he furnished to enable Government to determine the matter of the Political Agent’s jurisdic tion over the Indian Khojas at Maskat. 1. Do the Khojas at Maskat preserve a peculiar religion and peculiar social habits of their own, or do they combine with other communities ? 2. Are there any Khojas who are beyond question subjects of the Sultan. 3. If there are, do the Indian Khojas intermix with them or do the Indian Khojas form a separate community preserving an immiscible character ? 4. Do the members of the Khoja community at Maskat come from India only or from other parts of the world as well ? 5. Are there any general considerations which prevent the Khoja immi grants from acquiring the nationality of Maskat ? 6. Is the Sultan a party to the Begister of persons under British protection, or has he notice of it, and has he ever objected to the practice of registration ? 7. When Khojas born at Maskat of Indian parents come of age, are their names entered in the Begister ? 8. Are names ever entered in the Begister except at the request, or with the consent of the person themselves ? 9; Is it the open and acknowledged practice to treat adult Maskat born descendants of Indian born immigrants to Maskat as protected natives of India.7 I * ' I :H[ ) \ I have ascertained that their are 309 souls belonging to this sect now in Gwadur, who without exception claim British nationality. Besides these there would be a few Maskat Khojas, subjects of the Sultan, who have for the time migrated to Gwadur for purposes of trade. (h) With reference to the case of “ Abdul Hussein bin Fadl,” I have recorded a separate memorandum which I trust will he found to give a satis factory explanation of it. I beg to revert for a moment in conclusion to the general question of the protection of Khojas in Maskat. While objecting on principle, as long as they are treated as our subjects, to individual members of the sect doffing or don ning their British nationality for purposes of temporary convenience oi’ evasion of commercial obligation, I do not regard the community as by any means a valuable asset to us as subjects of the British Government At the same time it would I think be hardly conducive to their interests or to our prestige, for us suddenly to withdraw protection from them. In fact when we see around us representatives of foreign Powers leaving no stone unturned to create interests by the manufacture of proteges, we can ourselves hardly afford to throw away our own without very strong grounds. Among the enclosures to this note I have included a copy of the first notifica tion on record issued by Colonel Boss, warning British subjects to register themselves. It has formed the basis of all subsequent notifications in this connection. It may perhaps he important to note, that whatever may he said of our protection of these Khojas, the letters which are herewith produced dating from 1859, prove that the position was clearly and openly established at that time, which was considerably anterior to the declaration of 1862. Copy of a letter from Captain Jones on the subject of the registry of Fadhl Meran as a British subject, to His Highness Seyyid Thoweynee. Form ing accompaniment to letter to British Agent at Mascat, dated llth Shawal 1274 (=1858) below. After Compliments. Your letter dated 2nd Ramzan has been received and its contents under stood, on the subject of the person named Fadhl Meeran, a Khoja whom Your Highness understands to be one of your subjects having been born in the port of Muscat, and requesting me to forbid the British Agent Hezheil bin Eusof interfering on his behalf. Yesterday Fadhl bin Meran came to me himself, and I explained to him fully that he was not entitled to protection as a British subject, and that he is one of your Highness’s subjects. Our iigent is not authorized to interfere in his behalf, as was explained in my letter to Your Highness’s address of last Shawal. I have furnished our Agvent with written instructions on the subject of which I hand you a copy in order that he may not interfere in such matters. Copy of letter by Captain Jones on the subject of Khojas residing in Muscat to Hezheil bin Eusof, British Agent at Muscat, dated 14th Showal 1274. ( = 1858). It is not unknown to you as X have written to you before regarding the Khojas of Sind that they are subjects of the British Government, and it is your duty to assist and protect them, but it is requisite that I should further instruct you that those residing in Muscat who were born there and were sub jects of the late Sultan of Muscat before Hyderbad of Sind became part of the British possessions are not included as British subjects and are not registered as being under protection, and you should not interfere in their behalf.No. 323-116, dated the 5th August 1875. From— Lieutenant-Colonel S. B. Miles, Political Agent and His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Maskat, To—-The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. In acknowledging the receipt of your letter No. 625-294f, dated 18th June, forwarding for compliance copy of letter No. 1465-P., dated 19th May, from the Secretary to the Government of India requesting answers to certain questions regarding the Indian Khojas and Mascat te-enarble- Government to determine — the matter of the Political Agent’s jurisdiction over them, I have the honour to submit herewith the information called for accordingly. Memorandum of queries and replies. 1 . Do the Khojas of Maskat preserve a peculiar religion and peculiar social habits of their own or do they combine with other com munities. 2 . Are there any Khojas who are beyond question subjects of the Sultan ? 2. If there are, do the Indian Khojas intermix with them or do the Indian Khojas form a separate community preserving an immiscible character ? 4 . Do the members of the Khoja com munity at Maskat come from India only or from other parts of the world as well ? 5 . Are there any general considerations which prevent Khoja immigrants from ac quiring the nationality of Maskat ? The Khojas at Maskat do not combine with other communities. They dwell in a separate walled quarter at Mutrah called the Khoja Fort and intermarry only among themselves. They comprise two parties, viz., the followers of Agha Khan, who preserve their peculiar religion and social customs, and those who have recently adopted the Muhammadan religion. The latter are in the majority, but even those notwithstanding preserve some of their old social habits. Yes. Such as those whose ancestors emi grated from Sind prior to British conquest and such as have declared themselves Arab subjects. They are one and the same community and intermix. The Khojas are Indians and come from the provinces of Sind and Cutch. I am not aware of any general considera tions which would prevent Khoja immigrants from acquiring Arab nationallity if they pre ferred to do so. 6 . Is the Sultan a party to the Register of persons under British protection, or has he notice of it, and has he ever objected to the practice of registration ? The registration of persons is done with the Sultan's cognisance, but notice is not usually given him. He has never formally objected to the practice of registration so far as I am aware, but he has been furnished at his own request with a list of persons registered. 7 When Khojas born at Maskat of Indians parents come of age, are their names entered in the Register ? 8 . Are names ever entered in the Register except at the request or with the consent of the persons themselves ? 9. Is it the open and acknowledged prac tice to treat adult Maskat born descendants ot Indian born immigrants to Maskat as pro tected natives of India. Yes. On application being made by them. Names are never entered in the Register unless at the personal request of the persons and after investigation. has always been the custom to treat adult ;at born descendants of Indian immi- ;s as protected subjects provided the grants were themselves British _ subjects Meets of protected States, provided also descendants themselves desire to be so H. B. MILES, Lieut.-Colonel, Political Agent, E. B. M.’cc Case of Khoja Abdul Hussein bin Kadi. Mentioned on page 18 of French Statement, Part IV, Page 18. \V 10 Memorandum regarding the case of Abdul Hussein bin Fadl AH mentioned on page 19 of French Statement. Among the trading firms of Mascat and Mutrah is the British protected Khoja firm of “ Fadl Ali Toorani &amp; Co.,” trading with Bombay and Calcutta. Owing to the fact that its founder, Eadl Ali, migrated from India after the British Annexation of Sind and also that the trading operation of the firm are carried on with India, both the family and the firm have always enjoyed British protection. Fadj Ali died many years ago and left four sons who continued to carry on the business of the firm in his name. The eldest of these was Abdul Bab bin Fadl Ali and the second Abdul Hussein bin Fadl Ali, the individual referred to in the French Statement. The elder of the two became the head of the firm, still trading as “ Fadl Ali Toorani &amp; Co. In September 1901, when Political Agent at Muscut, I received for execution from the Calcutta Small Cause Court a decree against the firm for a considerable amount and from reports which reached me at the time of the state of the firm’s affairs I had reason to think that other similar claims from India were likely to follow. On the 9th January (1902) following, a petition was presented to me by the elder brother, Abdul Bab, asking that his name might be removed from the Register of British Subjects. No application of the sort was received at this time or any other from Abdul Hussein, but as far as my memory serves me he did present himself with his brother, when I called for the latter on 13th January 1902. On this occasion I explained to Abdul Bab, who offered no explanation of his wish suddenly to doff his British nationality, that while the British Government did not thrust their protection on people, nevertheless, seeing that he and his father had always hitherto claimed our protection, before I could take steps to take his name off the Begister, I must ask for six months’ notice and a substantial deposit as security for the satisfaction of any more claims that might come in against him as a British subject. It will be understood that there were strong grounds for thinking that his only object in desiring to take Muscat nationality in this sudden way was that it would be easier for him to evade as an Arab subject claims that might come against him from British India. He did not see his way to deposit any security and went ^ his way and I heard no more of his desire to change his nationality. He died a few months later. I may mention that I had always been on good terms with this Khoja, and he had always been one of the foremost in conveying expressions of loyalty to the British Government on official occasions, such as the King s Birthday and the 1st January. In December 1903 a suit was brought against the second brother, Abdul Hussein, in the Maskat Consular Court in connection with the title to possess a certain plot of ground. Defendant was, as usual, summoned to appear, but refused to accept the summons and a warrant had to be issued. On hearing of this Abdul Hussein came to see me of his own accord and said he had refused to sign the summons because he had, since his brother s application of two years before, considered himself a Maskat subject. I explained to him that I could not accept this explanation; that his brother had never completed the requirements for the removal of his name from the Be^ister, and that, under the circumstances, I could not consider him, Abdul Hussein, as anything else than a British Subject. He accepted my deeismn in the suit without further appeal, and I had no dispute of any kind with His ig i- ness the Sultan on the subject. If I saw him personally within a few days of taking the above aotionl should certainly have mentioned the matter to him and probably did, but I have no special recollection of doing so and His Highness certainly never addressed me any official communication on the subject. The course taken by me seems to me to have been a perfectly proper and natural one. If the Political Agent were to allow persons m the position of Abdul Hussein to evade their obligations by suddenly doffing their nationality there would be no limit to it. 'LlMy successor at Muscat, Major Grey, has had considerable dealings with Abdul Hussein in the Consular Court and informs me that the Khoja has never suggested any wish on his own part to change his nationality, and there can be hardly any doubt that his object in endeavouring to do so on the previous occa sion in question was the one which I have suggested. P. Z. COX, Major, Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gvdf, Mask at ; The 17th March 1905.Modus operandi of Soori dhows under French Flag in evading Customs Duty.12 Note on the modus operand} of Soori dhows under the 'French Flag^ plying between Bombay and Oman ports with cargoes of foodstuffs during the period 1900 to 1905. Please read the opening paragraph of Part V of the French Statement : “ Jamais nos proteges n’ont donne au Sultan, etc., etc.” It can he conclusively proved that the above statements are altogether at variance with the actual facts — (a) The present Sultan of Maskat has during the past constantly com plained that the French flagholders at Soori habitually evade payment of his legitimate 5 per cent, customs dues, wholly or partially. So much so that in 1901 he addressed me on the subject when Political Agent at Maskat, and in due course his representations were communicated to the Government of India, and subsequently under Maskat Office No. 495, dated 27th December 1901, the Political Secretary to the Government of Bombay was’ communicated with on the subject. A copy of it forms enclosure No. 1 to this note and I invite special attention to paragraph 3 thereof. From that time up to date the Government of Bombay have been good enough to supply the Sultan through the Political with regular monthly returns. (A specimen of them is forwarded for inspection). In view of the French statements quoted above a tabular summary of the returns has now been prepared (hnclosure No. 3). It consists of a list of French Flag dhows which have visited Bombay and cleared again for Oman ports during the past four years together with a record of the chief items of their manifested cargo. Being the ordinary record of a very efficient Government Department its general accuracy must be considered as unquestionable. The state of things disclosed by the compilation affords very interesting corroboration of the Sultan’s firm suspicions as represented in my letter No. 425 above k ere f ac t that Soor is a port containing according to common computation about 10,000 inhabitants. It not only gets all its own supplies, in the way of grain, from outside but is also the port through which nearly all the import and export trade of the Sharkiyeh and Jalaan districts of Oman are carried on. The foodstuffs brought into Soor thus provide for the wants not only of its 10,000 inhabitants but also of many thousands more of the Sultan’s subjects residing in the interior . x In this connection it will be seen from another accompaniment that whereas the Sultan, owing to the French flag difficulty, now only gets about 8 030 dollars per annum from the port, he considers that it should produce not less than 50,000 dollars, an opinion which any one with local knowledge will endorse and’ which I have repeatedly stated inofficial reports of the last six nC)W to Maseerah Island and treat it from the same point of view. Decent research in connection with the new Gazetteer now under preparation elicits the fact that— „ ^ n T , - “The inhabitants, about 1,000 m number, are all Jennebeh except a few Hikman families.” Their food is fish, turtles, and dates, with rice and flesh as occasional luxuries. Women and children eat shellfish. To such a population comparatively enormous quantities of rice are conveyed from Bombay, if we are to believe the Soor dhow-owners. The Bombay returns show that during the past five years French flagholders alone have “ manifested ” for Maseera alone 23,376 bags of rice, i.e. 23 bags of 168 lbs. each per head of population, by French dhows alone, whereas only 12,023 bags of rice (i e. half the quantity sent to Maseera) were imported to Soor, a town with a’population ten times the size and with a brisk hinterland provisioning I would furthermore draw pointed attention to the fact that it is this island of Maseera that has only recently been so unpleasantly in evidence in connection with the massacre of a whole boatload of European survivors from the shipwrecked steamer Baron Innerdale. . , , The Jennebeh Tribe by which Maseera is mainly inhabited is the same tribe from which the chief and majority of the French flagholders have been recruited The two settlements (Soor and Maseera) are connected by the closest tribal and kindred ties, in fact Maseerah may almost be regarded as an appanage of Soor.The fact of course is, as originally represented by the Sultan, that the Trench flagholders (and others also who are enabled with impunity to follow their example) fraudulently inform the officials of the Bombay Customs that their cargoes are destined for Maseera (or other ports whereat the Sultan cannot conveniently arrange for the institution of a Customs post owing to the turbulence of the inhabitants), but actually smuggle them into Soor. On arrival at Soor they bring their goods ashore secretly or even openly and then shew their manifest to the individual in charge of the Customs, and throw him perhaps a moiety of the duty which would - be due on the goods manifested to Soor alone. In the above we seem to have a very strong argument. We can both contend that the goods are obviously not really destined to Maseera though manifested there, and also that the French flagholders are evidently closely connected with their relatives on Maseera and provide them with the neces saries of life, and that it is these very islanders wffio have recently been res ponsible for the massacre of 17 shipwrecked Europeans. March 21st, 1905. P, z. COX. No. 495, dated the 27th December 1901. From— Major P. Z. Cox, His Britannic Majesty’s Consul and Political Agent Maskat, , To—The Secretary to Government in the Political Department, Bombay. I have the honour to acknowledge your letters Nos. 7518 and 8825, dated 30th October and 20th December respectively, asking for the names of ports under the jurisdiction of the Sultan of Maskat ; and regret that owing to the absence of the Sultan and myself from Maskat I have been unable to reply before now. 2. A list of the principal Oman ports in order of occurrence from south to north accompanies—the most important being underlined. 3. With regard to Soor (No. 5) it is believed that the Nakhodas of the large dhows hailing from that port which annually take foodstuffs from Bombay are in the habit of getting bogus destinations inserted in their manifests. For instance, a Nakhoda about to convey 500 bags of rice from Bombay to Soor would state at Bombay that 50 bags were destined for Soor and 450 bags were destined for Aden, Makulleh, or other port outside Maskat Jurisdiction or small Oman port, such as Nos. 2, 3, 4, where no Customs collection is at present feasible. They then smuggle their cargo on shore at night, and when asked for duty deny all but the smaller amount. It is difficult to see how any check is to be put on this practice by the Customs authorities in Bombay, but it would make the offence easier of detection by the Sultan, if the actual date of sailing from Bombay could be ascertained as accurately as possible, so that the allegations of the Nakhoda as to having returned to Oman via Makulleh, etc., could be checked by the period of time found to have been taken en route. It would be convenient, therefore, if the headings of the draft monthly return could be altered as follows :— Column 3 (altered to) “ Name of owner and port of domicile.” Cohmn 5 (altered to) “ Destination and date of sailing/’ 4. If it is possible for returns to be furnished in arrears since January 1900, only statistics for ports 1 to 5 inclusive would be necessaryfor that period. 5. In conclusion I am desired by His Highness the Sultan to express bis acknowledgments to the Government of Bombay for their courtesy in undertaking to supply him with this information.

In a separate note regarding the modus operandi of Soori dhows plying under the Prench flag I have given one instance of the difficulties which the existence of the flag among his subjects places in the way of the Sultan. I could, if time admitted, give many instances in which persons under British protection have failed to recover claims from so-called Prench proteges which they would have been able to realise through the Sultan if the defendants had been loyal subjects of His Highness. Por present purposes it will perhaps be sufficient to quote the case of Dewal bin Lilia, a Hindu British subject who has for many years resided at Soor for purposes of trade. He was for several years farmer of the Sultan’s customs at the Port of Soor, and having once got involved he was obliged to take on the contract from year to year in the hope of being able to recover his outstandings. He was unable to do so however, retired from the “ farm’* and is now in very humble circumstances, almost entirely owing to the existence of the Prench flag difficulty at Soor. Some of his debts date back 6 or 7 years, and most of them have not been inquired into at all, and during my tenure of the appointment of Politi cal Agent at Maskat I have many times endeavoured to get the Sultan to effect a settlement, on one occasion when he was actually at Soor. Asa matter of fact, however, the Hindus themselves know it is not to their interests or conducive to their personal safety under the present Government to have their claims forcibly extracted, and prefer to wait in the hope of the French flag difficulty being removed and of the Sultan being able to assert himself more vigorously. On the 22ad November last the Political Agent at Maskat, Major Grey, addressed the Government of India in connection with this case under his No. 561 of 1901, but on the matter being referred to me, I expressed the opinion that as the case had waited so loig, it would not be prejudiced if it were held in abeyance until the case before the tribunal had been decided. Since coming here a few days ago I have addressed a letter on the subject to His Highness the Sultan and enclose a copy of his reply and of my own letter. His Highness Seyyid Peisal’s letter shows clearly how the case stands and how the action of the Prench proteges indirectly results in a loss to him of some 40,000 dollars. The letter from Shaikh Hamood bin Sultan referred to in His Highness’s letter, and of which a copy is also attached, furnishes a good instance of the contumelious behaviour which he invariably experiences from the Prench flag-holders and which incenses him so against them. P. z. COX. The 21st March 1905, Translation of a letter from Major Cox to His Highness the Sultan of Muscat, dated 19th March 1905. After Complements. I have to address Your Highness concerning the claims of a certain British subject named Dewal, a Bania resident of Sur who was formerly customs farmer at that port. After the period of his management of the customs expired, he brought claims against some of the rich people of Sur, some of whom were acknowledged subjects of Your Highness while the others considered themselves to be under Prench protection. Now these claims, which ha^e been outstanding for seven years, were pressed upon Your High ness time after time both verbally and in writing and my successor Major Grey has also applied for justice regarding them, but they are still unsettled, not withstanding that Your Highness spares no effort to recover the claims of1 f 22 British Subjects and that your efforts are usually successful. That is the reason then, that the claims cannot be recovered in this case. Also will Your Highness kindly inform me as to the actual customs revenue of the port of Sur, and what that revenue would be if the customs arrangements were in a proper state. Also what is the reason for their not being in a more satisfactory condition ? I should also be obliged if Your Highness would tell me what is the popu lation of the port of Sur roughly ? This is what had to be put before you and Salaam. Hated 12th Moharram 1323. 19th March ]905. (Signed) P. Z. COX, Major, Offg. Political Kesident in the Persian Gulf. Translation of a letter received by Match Cox from His Highness the Sultan of Muskat, dated 19th March 1905. After Compliments. —In reply to your question regarding the debts owing to Dewal. Your honour understood from the letter which I received from Hamood bin Sultan at the time of my visit (to Sur) the refusal of the debtors to come to me in order that I might examine them concerning Dewal’s claims and the Customs dues. This refusal was on account of most of them claiming Trench protection, which is the reason for their declining to pay their creditors. Then as to the Customs revenue at Sur. The actual revenue is about 8,000 dollars (only), as most of the (proprietors of the) boats claim Trench pro tection, and the cargoes are hidden and their value concealed. If the Customs were conducted in a satisfactory manner the revenue would reach 50,000 dollars, and the want of proper arrangements is due to the opposition shewn by the people who suppose themselves to be under Trench protection to the Superin tendent of Customs and the Governor, regarding the amounts of Customs duty due by them; they do not pay the common rate per cent, which is demanded from them. Then as to the population of Sur, it is about 10,000 persons. This is what had to be explained and Salaam. it Dated 12th Moharram&gt; 1323. — 19th March 1905, } TAISAL BIN TURKI.

Note on tabular statement showing diecrepanoies in names of 'French Dhows and Owners and apparent use of flag by persons not entitled to it. V?25 Note on the list of Maskat subjects whom the French claim to protect, as fur nished with the French Case. It is three years ago since this list was promised by M. Gambon and neither I nor my successor Major Grey have ceased to remind Government or the vital importance to us of its possession before we proceeded with this case before the Hague Tribunal. Had we had a copy of it a few months ago our statement could have been much more complete. As it is, a list has been furnished with the French Statement, but in such a sketchy form that it is practically useless for purposes of verification. In this connection the Sultan has addressed me a letter this day expressing his own views with regard to it, with which I fully concur. I submit the letter in case it may^ be of use in enabling us to press for a list in the only form which will he entirely satisfactory. It appears to me, judging from the records here and from personal know ledge that the French have decided that they will lose nothing by credit ing individuals with more dhows than they really possess and with much more numerous crews than they really employ. According to their figure they claim to protect 1,050 adult persons in Soor. Now the total population of Soor, women and children included, is on about 10,000, and of those not more than two-fifths would be adult males, so that the French claim to protect at least a quarter of the population. The Sultan’s reference to the three dead men on the list requires no com ment. Compare Monsieur Laronce’s action in the recent Debai case where he lodged a claim in behalf of a man who had been dead two years. It is also interesting to note that one of the dead men mentioned in the at tached letter from the Sultan, namely, Salim bin Mahomed-el-Badi (or Libadi) No. 22 in French list, was the subject of report by my predecessor Major Fagan in 1897. I attach a copy of the letter referred to and suggest that it might be made use of, as it shows the lax principles on which the French enroll their proteges. I suggest to that we should without fail make the most of the inclusion by the French of these three dead men, in our present state ment to go in on 1st May. If we do not the French will find out their mistake and deprive us of the chance of scoring a point over it. In connection with this list I beg to report that Major Grey on getting a copy of it gave it to the Sultan with the request that he would take steps to have the names identified. His Highness addressed me on this subject in the letter which forms the first enclosure to this note, but he had previously sent down a trusted representative to Soor with instructions to collect what information he could get with regard to the names on the list. His retainer who left here about a week ago for Soor has replied to the Sultan this evening that the French protege refused to give him any information or have any intercourse with him whatever and referred him to the French Consul. Added to this the French Consul has just been asking the Sultan for a boat to take him down to Soor. From this it would appear that the French intend to prime the proteges thoroughly as to what to say and to refuse to communicate with the Sultan or his representative except through the French Consul and thus frustrate any satisfactory inquiry into the status of the proteges. These considerations prompt me to urge very strongly the impor tance of getting in the list in a proper form, however much the French may endeavour to evade giving it. P. Z. COX, Major, March 2Ut 1905. Copy of a letter addressed to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf by Mis Highness the Sultan of Maskat, dated lAth Muharrum 1322, {21st March 1905). After compliments.-}—1. have the honour to make a reference to you regarding the 30 persons from among my subjects whom the French Govern ment claim to protect, together with their dhows and the crews thereof, C?{ , ! if Ik'i 26 according to the list furnished to me a few days ago. As a matter of fact the details given in the list (as now supplied) are not sufficient for the proper identification of the individuals, and I see in the list possibilities of doubt and confusion in the matter of identity, for instance one of them is quoted as “ Juma bin Saeed ” and his dhow the “ Fateh-el-Kbair ” and its Nacoda “ Khalfan bin Ahmed” ; and, God knows, there may be 20 persons in Soor of the name of “Juma bin Saeed ” or “ Khalfan bin Ahmed ” and similarly there might be 20 dhows named the “ Eateh-el-Khair Until such time therefore as the fullest inquiry can be made with regard to each person named in the list, with opportunities for the production of witnesses and documents I cannot admit that any single one of those mentioned is entitled to French protection. Accordingly it has been necessary to inform you to that effect. The details which I require in regard to the claimants are as follows ;— The individual's name, such as Mubarak (bin). His father's name, ,, Salim (bin). His grandfather's name, „ Mahomed. His nickname, if any „ “ El Katheree '. His clan or sub-tribe „ Fowaris. His tribe „ Jennebeh. That is Mubarak bin Salim bin Mahomed El Katheree Clan Fowaris, Tribe Jennebeh. I beg you will obtain this information for me, and communicate it to me. Apart from the above request I note that among the individuals named on this list whose names I recognise as belonging to persons whom I can identify ( as claiming French protection) are included several persons long since dead. How can the French Government include such in their list? Those to whom I refer are three in number— (1) Salim bin Mahomed A1 Badi (No 93 on French list). (2) Seleem bm Thabet (No. 14 „ „ „). (3) Ahmed bin Saeed (No. 22 „ „ „). This is what had to be explained, and Salaam. (Signed) FEISAL BIN TUKKI, Sultan of Maskat, Dated 14th Muharrum 1322. Copy of a letter addressed by Major C. Fagan^ Folitical Agent at Maskat, to the Resident in the Fersian Gulf, No. 31, dated 20th January 1898. Paragraphs 1 to 4 inclusive refer to the two French protected slave dhows captured by the Sphinx respectively named the Salama and the Saad (videconnected correspondence). (o) I am informed that it is quite a common thing for inhabitants of Scor, the Batineh Coast, and other places in the Persian Gulf * * * * to send their dhows down to French settlements and fraudulently represent that they belong to inhabitants living in those places, thus obtaining French papers and the right to fly the French Flag. ( 6 ) Tlle . following is a case in point. About two or three months ago Abdul Mohsin, an inhabitant of the island of Keis (Persian Territory), made a complaint to the Sultan of Maskat against one Yusuf bin Saeed of the Yal Saad tribe, an inhabitant of Mesnaa, -Batineh Coast, to the effect that this indi vidual was the Nacoda of complainant’s dhow, and while serving in this capa- city took the dhow to Bookeyn (a port in Madagascar) and fraudulently obtained French papers for the dhow, which he registered in the name oi Salim bin Mahomed' al Radi, who was at the time living in French territory, hut was originally a subject of the Sultan of Maskat. The complainant repiesented also that the Nacoda has at the same time returned to Mesnaa on the Batineh, and had beached the dhow and put her up to auction. C I27 (7) On receiving this complaint the Sultan ordered the Wali to make inquiries into the case, which he did, with the result that the complainant’s story was found to be correct. Salim bin Mahomed el Badi, who happened to be at Mesnaa at the time, took over the papers and the French flag from the Nacoda of the dhow and returned them to the Wali. I am informed that there has been some correspondence on the subject between the Sultan and the French Vice-Consul. (8) I beg to add in conclusion that the two Nacodas alluded to in para graph 9 of my letter No. 25, dated I4th instant, as still undergoing a term of imprisonment, inflicted on them by the Court at Borbon, were released on the 18th instant, at the request of the French Vice-Censul.

Objects for which French Consulate at MasTcat was inaugurated, namely, cultivation of proteges and opposition to British Influence.Note in regard to the admitted object of the French Government in appointing a Consul to Maskat. In Part I of the Prencli Case headed “ DE LA PRAN CIS ATION BPS BOUTRES INDIGENE.. ” (Page 6 lines, 48 to 51), reference is made to the inauguration of their Consulate at Maskat on 24th January 1894. It may he useful to us to draw attention in reference to this paragraph, in our rejoinder to the speeches at the debate started in the Erench Chamber by Monsieur Deloncle of which the dispatch of Monsieur Ottavi to Maskat was the immediate result. A copy of their report of our Ambassador in Paris on this subject was forwarded to the Goyernment of India under India Office No. 50, dated 10th Eehruary 1893, from the Political Secretary to the Secretary in the Foreign Department. ° Monsieur Deloncle opened his speech in favour of the institution of a Vice-Consulate at Maskat by referring to the recently concluded Russian, alliance daily becoming firmer, and continued “ nous avons en m5me temps signe avee elle une sorte de convention qui ne s’applique seulement aux choses d’Europe. ” He then went on to say that the Erench flag was un known in the Persian Gulf, where Russian influence alone placed any check upon the progress of England, and proceeded to explain how very necessary it had now become for France “ d’immatriculer le plus t6t possible les boutres de nos sujets ou proteges Omanis et Arabes du Golfe Persique et de la c6te Arabique, qui vont et yiennent entre Mascate, Obock, Djibouti, Aden, Bombay et Zanzibar, sous peine de les voir passer sous le pavilion hritannique. Je considere qu’il est du devoir et de le honnour de la Prance d’avoir la-bas un Agent consulaire, si modeste qu’il soit pour ouvrir un registre de nos nationaux proteges et clients de toute la region. Nous affirmerons par la notre solidarite rdelle avec la grande nation qui est notre allice, le souci constant de notre petite marine indigene et le renouveau de notre pavilion dans ces parages de la mer des Indes, oun nous fumes jadis les maitres. Je demande a la Cham- bre de voter le credit. ” This is on the records of the India Office, and I merely quote the above for ready reference, the time at our disposal being so short. Mons. Deloncle’s words and their immediate result, the appointment of Mons. Ottavi, furnish a sufficient explanation of increased activity of the Erench from that epoch in the direction of distributing their flag, and of their object in doing so. P. Z. COX, Major. %l$t March 1905.29 N Note on tlio limits of Jilcishdt tawitovy• I can offer little useful information on this point. Oman is a very loose term at the present day, and is used with totally different meaning at various centres and m various connections. This is thoroughly gone into and explained n «fS er ? history of the Imams and Seyyids of Oman (Hakluyt Society 1871), and it is still the case at the present day. All we seem concerned with is as to what were the limits of the Sultan’s normal jurisdiction at the time of the signing of the Declaration of 18152 with the Drench. These had not changed when Colonel Pelly wrote his Report No. 67 of 15th April 1863 to the Chief Secretary of the Bombay Government, At that time the northern limit or Maskat was found to “ include the Mussendom promontory, inclusive of Khoomzar and Khussab,” and the frontier between Maskat and Ras-ul-Khyma territory is near where the (maritime) plain and mountains meet at Shuam. ,, When Political Agent at Maskat in 1902 I was instructed to investigate on the spot the northern limits of Maskat jurisdiction and proceeded to do so Without having previously seen Colonel Felly’s Report No. 67 I arrived by independent investigation at precisely the same conclusions. These were reported in Maskat No. 290, dated 2ud July 1902, and also in the demi-official letter from myself to the Secretary to the Government of India, dated Septem ber 1903, in which I point out the identity of my conclusions with those of Colonel Pelly. There is ample evidence from 1860 onwards, in the records of the Maskat Agency, that the Pirate Coast Trucial Chiefs were not under the jurisdiction of the Sultan of Maskat but quite independent of him and within the juris diction of the Resident in the Persian Gulf and not of the Political Agent and Consul accredited to Maskat. On the South Coast Ras Sair or Sajir is the undoubted boundary, but I have not been able to discover the original author for it. The Revd. Mr. Badger, at page iv of his introduction, aptly states that the boundaries of Oman depend in a great measure upon the personal character of the native rulers, and the success or failure of their policy towards the tur bulent outlying tribes. Thus at times, in 1839, for instance, Sohar has been declared independent; and at the present time the stretch of coast between Mureir and Diba is under Jowasmi jurisdiction. As the question of boundaries is one which will perhaps have to be decided more or less arbitrarily by Government I hesitate to say more on the subject without special research for which there has not been sufficient time and for which there is little or no local material.

Richey, Esq., C.S.I., Chief Secretary to the Governmen^ Bombay, Political Department, To—H. M. Durand, Esq., C.S.I., Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. With reference to the correspondence ending with the letter from your office, No. 1806-E., dated 16th November 1885, I am directed to toward here with, for submission to the Government of India, copy of a petition, dated 27th January last, from Abdulla Ibrahim and Abdul Husain Abdulla, Khojas of Muscat, who complain of the ill-treatment on account of their religious veiws received by certain Khoja women in Muscat at the hands of their husbands and pray for the interference of Government. 2. The Governor in Council being doubtful as to the authority of the peti tioners to address Government on behalf of Khoja woman in Muscat, a refer ence was made to the Commissioner of Police, Bombay, a copy of whose report (No. 832, dated 23rd ultimo, with enclosures) is appended. 3. In transmitting these papers I am to observe that the subject of the complaint appears to be a matter in which it is difficult to interfere, and that perhaps the best reply to the petition would be that the Political Agent will protect British subject, but cannot interfere on behalf of the subject of Native States like Kutch. It is, however, a matter for consideration whether, as Native States are not permitted to have direct relations with foreign powers, our Consular Agents are not bound to protect the subjects of such States in the same manner as if they were British subjects. This is a question which not unfre- quently arises, and the Governor in Council would be glad to have the order of the Government of India upon it. No. 37. Petition, dated Bombay, 27th January 1886. To—The Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department. We, the undersigned Khojas of Muscat, beg most respectfully to bring to your notice that about four hundred Khojas, who formerly belonged to the Shia Ismaeli sect of Khojas, have recently seceded from their original creed, and adopted another faith, and are now resorting to every possible mode of oppres sion and torture to force their wives contrary to their wish to join their new creed, and in such ill-treatment they are supported by His Highness the Sultan of Muscat and his officers who, like the seceders, say that the Shia Ismaeli creed is false and unacceptable to God. Some time ago a case of torture of a Khoja woman by her husband came before Her Britannic Majesty’s Consul for decision, and the husband was upon investigation of the offence found guilty and sent enced by the Consul to one year’s imprisonment; but His Highness the Sultan released him on the ground that both the husband and wife were his subjects, and not British subjects. It will thus be apparent to you that a large number of Khoja females at Muscat are totally unprotected, and are reluctantly compelled to put up with and bear every insult and wrong to which they are subjected by the religious hatred of their husbands; and are altogether without any means of having their griev ances redressed by appeal to justice, as they are shut out from all proofs against their husbands’ guilt. It may be mentioned that these females for a considerable time practised the “Takya” or mental reservation which is sanctioned by the Shia Ismaeli creed, whereby tbe believers of that creed are allowed the liberty of outwardly profes sing any other creed adverse to their own, if such should be necessary to be done for saving their lives or injury to their person or property; but on their being assured by Her Majesty’s Britannic Consul, that under the British rule 1TOEEIGN DEPARTMENT, E 37-38 Ill-treatment of Khoja women by their husbands at Muscat. they had nothing to fear from an open confession of their real faith, and that they would be protected from any injury or harm which might come to them from such confession, they openly stated to the Consul, that they were staunch believers m the Shia Ismaeli creed, and were quite unwilling to adopt any other creed opposed thereto, as their husbands had done. The result of such confession was that the ill-treatment of their wives by the seceders became more iolent than before, and has now become quite intolerable. In several cases the wives were divorced by their husbands. Under the above circumstances, we most respectfuly solicit that Govern ment will kindly be pleased to make inquiries into the matter and adopt such measuies as may be necessary or expedient to ensure due protection to the females against the insolence and fanaticism of their husbands. We also further solicit that Government will be pleased to adopt some effectual check ao-ainst the interference of His Highness the Sultan and his officers in matters con nected with these females, and decide once for all whether they and their bus bands, who originally resided in Kutch, Sind and other places in British terri tory and went to Muscat for the purposes of trade, are to be considered as British subjects or as Sultan s subjects, as we apprehend that until this point is finallv cleared up, His Highness the Sultan and his officers will always interfere to thwart the ends of justice, and the females vvill remain unprotected against the insults and oppression of their husbands and be liable to be tortured as often as their fanaticism may prompt them to do.

Petition signed by Abdulla Ibrahim and Abdul Husain Abdulla to Government of Bombay, and other enclo sures. I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of copies of the marginally noted correspondence, forwarded for enquiry and report under your docket No. 112, dated 20th July 1886, and have the honor to report that— 2. I have made enquiry from Abdul Husain Abdulla, who is now in Mus cat, regarding the petition signed by him, and that he states that the petition was prepared in English by Karim Khan, Secretary to His Highness Aga Sultan Muhammad Shah; that it was not translated to him, and that not knowing English he does not know what it contained, but that the facts of the case are these: when he was in Bombay, some seven or eight months ago, he received a letter from a Khoja woman, an Aga Khani named Euli, residing in Mattrah, telling him that she had been imprisoned by the Sultan of Muscat on account of her faith, and asking him to interfere in her behalf, and that he went to Karim Khan about the matter, but neither stated to him, and has never heard, that any Khoja had been sentenced to a year’s imprisonment by the British Consul at Muscat, and subsequently released by the Sultan of Muscat; such a case has never hap pened, and that if such is stated in the petition he was not cognisant of it, he being unacquainted with English. 3. The true statement of the case is as follows, and is contained in a Con sular memorandum in this office:—A Khoja widow woman, named Euli, an Arab subject, living at Mattrah, has three daughters, two married to Khojas who have seceded and who are Arab subjects. The unmarried daughter was in the habit of taking with her whenever she and her mother left their house such valuables as they possessed, and of these she was apparently robbed by two Arab subjects on the evening of the 3rd December 1885. On the follow ing day a complaint was made in this office concerning this robbery by a British subject, named Muhammad Ali bin Aziz, who stated that his wife, Euli’s 1 » frFOREIGN DEPARTMENT, E 147-149 Alleged ill-treatment of Khoja women at Muscat. daughter, had been robbed by Arab subjects, and the case was accordingly for warded to the Local Government for “ enquiry and punishment of the offen ders ” ; it then turned out that the applicant was not married to Fuli’s daughter, and that in stating that the girl was his wife, he made a false statement, for which he was severely cautioned, and the girl being an Arab subject this Con sulate did not interfere further in the matter. I am informed that the widow Fuli was imprisoned for four or five days by order of the Sultan for endeavour ing to induce her married daughters to make open confession of being Ao&gt;a Khanis or otherwise interfering in their household affairs. 4. Most of the natives of India—Kutch, Sind, &amp;c.,—residing at Muscat are British-protected subjects registered as such in this Consulate, and somewhat informally are under British Consular jurisdiction, but there are also many whose ancestors originally (like those of the woman Fuli and her children) came from India and settled in this country who are accounted Arab subjects, are not amenable to this Consulate jurisdiction, and do not receive British pro tection. 1 5. It is quite possible that some women, who cling to the Aga Khani faith and happen unfortunately to be united to seceders from that faith, may find their homes not so happy or pleasant as formerly, but for those who are British subjects this Consular Court is open in which to plead their wrongs, but they must be of such a nature that a Court can take cognisance of, and no complaints of the kind have, as far as I am aware of, been made. Mythical cases of “ tor- ture ’* hardly call for special legislation. No. 148. No. 2042-E., dated Simla, 2nd September 1886. From—W. J.

Colonel Mockler observes that the registered subjects of Indian Feudatory States are somewhat informally under British Consular jurisdiction. 3. With reference to this remark, I am to request that Colonel Mockler’s attention may be invited to Aitchison’s Treaties, Volume VII, pao'e 109, where it will be seen that the Sultan of Muscat, by an agreement concluded in 1873 engaged that subjects of Native States in India who might commit offences within Muscat dominions, should be amenable to the Consular Court in the same way as British subjects. 4. Theie does not therefore appear to be any reason why the jurisdiction exercised over such persons should be of an informal character. rUfarl®. No. 2043-E., dated Simla, 2nd September 1886. From—W. }.

Your Excellency:- I have the honour to acknowledge the re- f ' celpt of your Note of the 6th ultimo on the subject of the Arbitration now pending before the Hague Tri bunal in regard to the Muscat Ehows. Your Excellency states that the French Gov^ crnment have observed with sane surprise that the British Case is stated to be presented in the name of the Sultan of Muscat as well as in that of His Majesty’s Government, and you add that the French Goverrment are unable to agree to the introduction of the name of His Highness as one of the parties to the discussion which is about to take place before the Tribunal. I would ask Your Excellency to point out to the French Government that the terms of the Corn- promis signed on the 15th of October last distinctly indicate that the Sultan of Muscat is the party pri marily His Excellency, Monsieur Gambon, &amp;c*, &amp;c., &amp;c..V primarily interested in the solution of the ques tions at issue* His Highness would therefore clearly appear to have a moral right to he heard on the subject either by representing his own case to the Tribunal or by entrusting hie interests to the care of one of the parties to the Arbitration. His Majesty’s Government will be prepared to maintain and to prove by documentary evidence that the Sultan has elected to commit his cause to their care, of his own free will, and not, as is implied in the case presented by the French Goverrment, in consequence of any pressure put upon him by the Bri tish Authorities. It was for these reasons that His Majesty's Government considered that the case which they have put forward should be presented in the name of the Sultan as well as in their own. They do not however regard it as essential that the name of His Highness should appear as one of the Plaintiffs in the suit and they will, in deference to the views of the French Government, omit it in the A (further documents to he presented to the Court at The Hague. His Majesty's Goverrment propose to forward copies of Your Excellency's note and of this reply to the Tribunal. I have, &amp;c.. (Signed).- 5 , .

WITH reference to my immediately preceding despatch No. 30 of to-day’s date, i have the honour to report that I learn confidentially from M. de Ruyssenaers that, with his intervention, M. Savornin Lohman has been in correspondence by post and telegraph to the following efiect with Mr. Justice Fuller as to the selection of an Umpire in the Muscat Arbitration since or immediately after the 1st instant, when the appointment of Mr. Fuller was notified to the International Bureau, viz. :— In the first instance M. Lohman sent Mr. Fuller the names of the following three members of the Court from which to select an Umpire—viz,, M. Charles Lardy, of Switzerland ; M. Beernaert, of Belgium ; and Professor Asser, of the Netherlands. Mr. Fuller replied that in view of the mention of the King of Italy in Article I of the Agreement, he would, out of compliment to His Majesty, propose Count Nigra as Umpire. . To this M. Lohman agreed, and M. Ruyssenaers informed Count Nigra o± Jus selection by the Arbitrators, but his Excellency answered that owing to ill-health, which confined him to his room, he could not accept the appointment. This refusal was notified to Mr. Fuller, and the names of Messrs. Lardy, Beernaert, and Asser were again submitted to him. Mr. Fuller replied that he would prefer M. Graen, of Sweden, as a knowledge or English was of vital importance. . . On the receipt of this telegram M. Lohman answered, likewise by telegraph, that asM Graen was the President of the Tribunal in the pending Japanese House-Tax Arbitration, he did not think it would do to select him as Umpire m the Muscat Case and again submitted the names of Messrs. Lardy, Beernaert, and Asser, and added that the mouth’s delay for selecting an Umpire according to the Agreement would expire on the 25th instant. • . i To this telegram neither M. Lohman nor M. Ruyssenaers have lecei'ved any lep y, and it was for this reason that the former addressed his letter of yesterday’s date to M. Ruvssenaers, of which I have transmitted a copy in my above-named despatch. * X liave &amp;c. (Signed) HENRI 7 HOWARD.

(ft) The attitude which, had it not been for subsequent events, Her late Majesty’s Government would have been prepared to adopt in respect to the letter, of which a draft was offered by the Sultan on the 16th May 1900, is indicated in the letter from the Foreign Office, No. 25, dated the 15th June 1900, of which a copy is enclosed. The British Government would have been willing, on receipt of such an appeal from the Sultan, to address friendly representations to the French Government for the purpose of obtaining an examination of the practice complained of and the rectification of any abuses. In consequence of the Sultan’s action at Sur, the French Government have since undertaken to investigate the title of the Suri dhow owners to French pro tection, and to remedy any existing abuses : and, as you were informed in the telegram from the Government of India, dated the 1st December 1900, they will he reminded of their promise. In the light of the view which Her late Majesty’s Government have taken of the situation, it does not appear that the signing of the draft letter by the Sultan would give to the British Gov ernment any locus standi to act officially on his behalf beyond the extent above indicated. '1 h /Vajfj (TO. 9 ^i/V)9 £3 5 ~ V' FOREIGN OFFICE. February 14th, 1905. Immediate I am directed by the Marquess of Lansdcvme to transmit to you, to he laid before the Secretary of State for India, a copy of a Note from the French Ambassador at this Court stating that the French Gov- ment ore unable to agree to the introduction into the British Case recently presented to the Hague of the parties to the discussion of the question of the issue of French flags to Muscat dhows. Copies of the British and French cases in this Arbitration have been already communicated to you un officially. Monsieur Gambon's Note has been referred to His Majesty's Attorney General and it will be seen from the Memorandum, of which a copy is enclosed, that Sir H. Finlay is of opinion that the case of His //^-Tribunal of the name of the Sultan of Muscat as one Tiie Under Secretary of State, India Office. Majesty'sI * Maj esty* s Government must naturally be also that of ulie Sultan of ^fuscat in the sense that the acts com plained of are infringements of the sovereignty of His Highness, and that so long as the substance of the contention of His Majesty’s Government that he has placed his interest in their hands is preserved no importance need be attached to the appearance of the Sultan’s name in the Title or text of the Brit ish Case. In these circumstances Lord Lansdowne would propose, if Mr. Brodrick concurs, to answer the French Ambassador in the following sense:- That the terms of the Compromis of the 13th of October last distinctly indicate that the Sultan of Muscat is the party primarily interested in the solution of the questions at issue. ihao His Highness nas therefore clearly a moral iignt to oe neard on the subject either by represent ing. nis own case, or by entrusting his interests to uhe care ci one of the parties to the Arbitration.That he has elected to commit his cause to His Majesty’s Government of his own free will and not/ as appears to he implied in the French Case, in con sequence of pressure placed upon him hy the British authorities. That in these circumstances His Majesuy’s Govern ment do not regard it as essential that the Sultan’s name should appear as one of the plaintiffs in the case, and that it will he omitted in the further documents which His Majesty’s Government will present to the Tribunal. And finally that His Majesty*s Government pro pose to send copies of the correspondence to the Tribunal for their information. Lord Lansdowna would further propose that docu mentary evidence of the Sultan's spontaneous decision to commit his interests to His Majesty’s Government should be given in the British Counter-Case. Mr. Brodrick will perhaps think it desirable to consult the Government of India, as suggested by the Attorney General and if so His Lordship hopes thatthe reference will he made ty telegraph in order that a reply may he returned to the French Ambassa dor* s note with as little delay as possible.

PREFACE. ON the 14th day of October, 1903, a Convention was signed in London by the Representatives of Great Britain and France providing for the settlement by arbitration of certain classes of questions which might arise between the two Governments. Appendix No. I. The full text of the Convention is set out in the Appendix to this Case. On the 13th day of October, 1904, a second Agreement was signed in London by the Repre sentatives of Great Britain and France, referring to arbitration, in accordance with Article I of the Convention of the 14th October, 1903, certain difficulties which had arisen as to the scope of a reciprocal Declaration made on the 10th day of March, 1902, by Great Britain and France, whereby the Governments of the said Powers engaged reciprocally to respect the independence of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat. The full text of the said Agreement is as follows :— “ Agreement between Great Britain and France, referring to Arbitration the Right of certain Muscat Dhows to fly the French Flag, &amp;c.

W hen this Treaty was concluded the dominions of the Sultan of Muscat included the territories of Zanzibar, which became an inde- August 5, 1890. pendent Sultanate in 1856, and in 1890 fell under the Protectorate of Great Britain, in virtue of arrangements made with France and Germany. 5. The Sultan of Muscat has also from time to time concluded Treaties of Friendship and Commerce with Great Britain. The Treaty at present in force was concluded on the 19th August, 1891, and the ratifications were exchanged at Muscat on the 20th February, 1892. The full text of the Treaty is given in the Appendix to this Case. The following Articles appear to be material to the present controversy, as affecting the application of the most-favoured-nation clause in the French Treaty of 1844 :— “ARTICLE II. “ Subjects of Her Britannic Majesty shall, for the purposes of this Treaty, include subjects of native States in India in alliance with Her Majesty. Such subjects shall enjoy, immediately and unconditionally, throughout the dominions of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat, with respect to commerce, shipping, and the exercise of trade, as in every other respect, all the rights, privileges, immunities, advantages, and protection of whatsoever nature, which are, or here after may be, enjoyed by, or accorded to, the subjects or citizens of the most favoured nation. “ They shall, more especially, not be liable to other or more onerous duties, imposts, restrictions, or obliga tions of whatever description, than those to which subjects or citizens of the most favoured nation now are, or hereafter may be, subjected. “ARTICLE XIII. “ Subjects of Her Britannic Majesty shall, as regards their person and property, enjoy within the dominions of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat the rights of exterritoriality. “ The authorities of His Highness the Sultan have no right to interfere in disputes with subjects of Her Britannic Majesty amongst themselves or between them and members of other Christian nations; such questions, whether of a civil or criminal nature, shall be decided by the competent Consular authorities. The trial and also the punishment of all offences and crimes of which British subjects may be accused within [1413] C I ^the dominions of His Highness the Sultan, also the hearing and settlement of all civil questions, claims, or disputes in which they are the defendants, is expressly reserved to the British Consular authorities and Courts, and removed from the jurisdiction of His Highness the Sultan. “Should disputes arise between subjects of His Highness the Sultan or other non-Christian Power, not represented by Consuls at Muscat, and a subject of Her Britannic Majesty, in which the British subject is the plaintiff or complainant, the matter shall be brought before and decided by the highest authority of the Sultan, or some person specially delegated by him for this purpose. The proceedings and final decision in such a case shall not, however, be con sidered legal unless notice has been given and an opportunity afforded for the British Consul or his sub stitute to attend at the hearing and final decision. “AKTICLE XIV. “ Subjects of His Highness the Sultan, or any non- Christian nation, not represented by Consuls at Muscat, who are in the regular service of British subjects within the dominions of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat, shall enjoy the same protection as British subjects themselves. “Should they be charged with having committed a crime or serious offence punishable by law, they shall, on sufficient evidence being shown to justify further proceedings, be handed over by British employers or by order of the British Consul, to the authorities of His Highness the Sultan for trial and punishment. “ARTICLE XVIII. “ The houses, dwellings, warehouses, and other premises of British subjects, or of persons actually in their regular service within the dominions of His High ness the Sultan of Muscat, shall not be entered, or searched under any pretext, by the officials of His Highness without the consent of the occupier, unless with the cognizance and assistance of the British Consul or his substitute.” On the 10th day of March, 1862, the following Declaration was signed in Paris by the Repre sentatives of Great Britain and France :— “ Declaration between Great Britain and France, engaging reciprocally to respect the Independence of the Sultans of Muscat and Zanzibar. 1862. “ Her Majesty the Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and His Majesty the Em peror of the French, taking Signed at Paris, March 10, “ Sa Majeste la Reine du Royaume-Uni de la Gran de-Bretagne et dTr- lande et Sa Majeste I’Empereur des Fran^ais,into consideration the im portance of maintaining the independence of His Sultan Muscat and of His High ness the Sultan of Zanzibar, have thought it right to engage reciprocally to re spect the independence of these Sovereigns. “ The Undersigned, Her Britannic Majesty’s Am bassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary at the Court of France, and the Minister Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs of His Majesty the Emperor of the French, being furnished with the necessary powers, hereby declare, in con sequence, that their said Majesties take reciprocally that engagement. “ In witness whereof the Undersigned have signed ' the present Declaration, and have affixed thereto the seals of their arms. “ Done at Paris, the 10th March, 1862.

By these Treaties the Sultan has entered into definite obligations as to the measures to be undertaken within his territories and territorial waters for the sup pressing of such trade. The European Powers have for many years interested themselves in the suppression of the oversea Slave Trade from Africa to Asia, and that trade has ceased to be carried on by Euro peans, and so much of it as still remains is carried on by Asiatics or Africans in native craft. France has for many years refused to permit the exercise by warships of any other Power of any droit de visits on the high seas with regard to ships carrying the French flag. Arabs con cerned in the oversea Slave Trade (“ traite des noirs ”) are fully aware of this policy, and have sought to obtain the benefit of the French flag in two ways : (1) by hoisting it without authority ; (2) by obtaining licence to hoist it from French Consuls in the Eastern seas, or from the authorities in French Colonies or Protectorates. The existence of this abuse of the French flag by Asiatics has been ascertained by the experience of the naval officers engaged in suppressing the oversea Slave Trade, and the attention of the French Government has been from time to time called to the abuse of the French flag by Arab slave-traders. In 1890 a Conference of the Powers was held at Brussels for the purpose of concerting measures for the complete suppression of the African Slave Trade, and the Conference resulted in the passing of a General Act on the 2nd July, 1890. The General Act w T as ratified by France on the 2 nd January, 1892, subject to a provisional reser vation with a view to a later agreement of Articles 21 , 22, 23, and 42 to 61. This partial ratification was coupled with a declaration that Articles 30-41 would be spontaneously applied by the French Government in the territory of Obokh, and, ac cording to necessity, in the Island of Madagascar and the Comoros. The effect of the partial ratification is to pre serve the claim of France to resist any claim to exercise on the high seas the droit de visite or to detain ve.'&amp;els under the French flag which are suspected of carrying slaves. 1845. 1878 II.

Per Major Cox. The Sultan of Muscat is not a party to the Brussels Act, but his obligations as to suppression of the Slave Trade are defined by the Treaties already mentioned. Until the acquisition by France of the Colonies or Protectorates of Obokh and Tajourah, the Comoros and Madagascar, little opportunity arose for the obtaining of French flags and papers by the owners or skippers of Arab dhows. But when it was found that France (almost alone among the Powers) had not consented to the provisions of the Brussels Act with reference to the search and detention on the high seas of vessels under her flag which were engaged in the Slave Trade, or guilty of the fraudulent use of a flag, and still maintained her objections to the visite of vessels under the drench flag, the owners and skippers of native vessels who wished to engage in the Slave Trade, or from any other cause to escape surveillance on the high seas by the war ships of the Signatory Powers, immediately had recourse to French authorities to obtain French flags and papers. From the conclusion of the Treaty of 1844 until the present time very few French citizens have established themselves in the territories of the Sultan of Muscat, and at the time when the differences to be settled in this arbitration arose there was in Oman only one French citizen (Goguyer) outside the Consular establishment, and one citizen of a Christian State not having a O Consul at Muscat, who was treated as being under the French Consul, nor were any branches of any French commercial house set up in the Sultan’s dominions. Consequently there were very few French citizens to take into their service any subjects of the Sultan. Notwithstanding the terms of the Treaty of 1844 and the Declaration of 1862, and the pro visions of Article XXXII of the Brussels Act of 1890, French officials in their Colonies or Protectorates of Obokh, Madagascar, and the Comoros have from time [ ? ] granted French ships’ papers, and flags to subjects of the Sultan of Muscat, and the same course has been taken by the French Consuls at Aden,* Muscat,! and Zanzibar.j ? I t \\ ' * The titres issued at Aden is inclosure 4 in No. 1, Suii dhow papers. t See the titres, file, pp. 206, 208, 210, 212. I These titres form also inclosures Nos. 15, 16, 17, 18 in No. 49, from India Office, August 11, 1900. [1413] D lThe bulk of the Omanis who have thus received French papers belong to the district of Jalani and town of Sur, within the territories and subject to the sovereignty of the Sultan of Muscat. The seafaring men among this population leave Sur with their vessels and voyage to India and Africa, returning at the end of the season and laying up their ships at Sur. Many of the owners of the vessels, having grown old and affluent, are content to send their vessels out under captains, and do not, themselves, leave Sur. Many of these Suris Cox. had been, and some still are, engaged in the over sea Slave Trade. In February 1891 the French Consul at the British port of Aden granted French papers and flags to eight captains or owners who were subjects of the Sultan of Muscat and resident at Sur. Appendix No. I, The fact was reported to the British Government, ^bo^NWember' and remonstrances were addressed to the French 20 &gt; 1891 * Government, in reply to which M. Bibot, then French Minister of Foreign Affairs, on the 20th Novembei, 1891, stated that the grant had been Appendix No. , made in error, and that he would not fail to take - , ot to ^ ttoa ’ _ inclosure 3 in the steps necessary to prevent its recurrence. No. 2, Suri dhows. This statement, made before the qualified and ^g 0 ^ em k er partial ratification by France of the Brussels Act of 1890, was understood by Great Britain to mean that France would no longer grant to Omani Arabs the use of French flags, or litres de navigation. Notwithstanding this statement, the French Nos. 4, 5, 6, 7, authorities at Obokh in 1892 granted French also 11^Nal^ 8 ’ papers to dhows w.hose owners and crews w'ere Suris, and the French Consul at Aden referred to the authorities at Obokh dhow owners who applied to him at Aden for French papers. Ihe Sultan of Muscat has never admitted that this grant of French flags or papers is warranted by Treaty or usage, nor that the French authori ties are entitled to make themselves judges or protectors of any of his subjects who are not actually and bond fide in the service of French subjects in his dominions. He expressed his objections so far back as 1891, and in that year Muhammad-bin-Mubarak-bin-Salim, his Wali at Sur, ordered the skippers to cancel their certificates and return them to the French, and this order May 13, 1893, seems in some cases to have been obeyed. p ' 88 ’ on file ' In March 1891 the Sultan furnished the British Inclosure 9 in Government with a list of thirteen captains of Na ^ Sur l dhow C . , , • 1 papers, and see bun boats carrying French colours. inclosure 8, March 14, 1891.

And the Sultan in that year took counsel with the British Government as to the use of French flags by his subjects, and was advised that the use of the French flag could have no effect as against him, and that he had full authority to punish any of his subjects who might infringe the laws of his country, whatever flag or papers they might have accepted. In June 1892 the British Government received information that French papers had been granted at Obokh to five large buggalows, all heavily armed and owned and manned by Boris, and made representations to the French Government with respect to these vessels asking for a searching inquiry. This inquiry was made, and in April 1893 M. Dorvelle, then Minister of Foreign Affairs, stated, as the result, that the owners, patrons, or proprietors had declared that they wished to settle in Jibuti, and had obtained con cessions of land. The Minister, though expressing himself satisfied with the result of the inquiry, stated that instructions had been 2 'iven to take the greatest care in verifying the papers of such vessels and in dealing with offences. It is further to be noted that the Gonsuls at Muscat and Zanzibar have, notwithstanding M. Bibot’s admission of error with respect to Aden, granted French papers in cases where even the formalities required in French Colonies could not be complied with, and it is particularly to be observed that certain of the litres de navigation emanating from those places omit statement of the residence and status of the owner of the vessel, and permit the employment of a foreicrn crew. o Notwithstanding the objections and representa tions above stated, from 1892 until the present time, the authorities in the French Colonies and Protectorates of Obokh, Madagascar, and Comoro have made a constant practice of granting French flags and ships’ papers to subjects of the Sultan of Muscat, natives of and residing in his dominions, chiefly in Sur. The applicants for the flag and papers are not naturalized nor French citizens, and have no authority from their Sultan to change their alle giance, nor do they settle in French territory, nor pay more than fleeting visits thereto for the purpose of renewing their licences. Some of them go through the form of buying a house, or depositing what is considered the value of a house in the Colony or Protectorate. But14 the whole transaction is colourable and fraudulent, and the French Colonial authorities are deceived by the machinations of these Arabs, and are thereby induced to grant licences to such persons in a manner inconsistent with Articles XXX to LX I of the Brussels Act, and not warranted by the municipal law of France or the Colonies as to the issue of ships’ papers or the grant to ships of the French flag, and also in a manner inconsistent with international law and comity. Subjects of the Sultan resident in his dominions who have obtained French flags and papers in the illegal and fraudulent manner above described have used the flag and papers for the purpose of the Slave Trade. Many reports have been received from British naval officers in the Indian Seas and from the British residents in Oman and on the Persian Gulf which establish this fact. Moreover, on returning to the waters and territory of Muscat these men have claimed— (1) That the Sultan is not entitled to board or search their vessels, or to exercise any jurisdiction over them ; (2) That they are not subject to the Sultan’s authority while in his territory, but are entitled to be treated as proteges of France and to be exempt from his laws as to customs, quarantine, and other matters. In these contentions they have been on several occasions supported by the French Consul in Muscat and by the French Government. In 1 894 as many as twenty-three dhows, hailing from Sur, and owned and manned by Suris. appear to have possessed French papers. A list of these vessels, given in No. in the Appendix, was communicated to the French Government on the 9th February, 1895, with a request for an investigation with a view to ascertaining whether the vessels were really registered. In consequence of this despatch, a French war ship, the ‘ Troude,’ went to Sur to verify the papers of any dhow flying the French flag. The results of this inquiry were not communicated to the Sultan of Muscat or the British Government, but the Commander of the vessel was understood by the British Agent at Muscat to state that the practice of granting to Sun dhows the French flag and papers at Obokh had been stopped. On the 28th June, 1895, this statement was brought to the attention of the French Govern- v January 20, 1898, Fagan. See September 20. 1894; June 18, 1900, Cox, in closure 7 in No. 49, file, p. 53.

The litre referred to is exhibited there. ment. At first it was passed over sub silentio, but ultimately, in reply to a further inquiry, the French Minister in London, on the IGtli March, 1897, informed Lord Salisbury that there had been a misapprehension, and that there was no intention of discontinuing the practice, and in May 1897 the British Govern ment received a Report from the Sultan of Muscat, through the British Agent there, that French papers were being obtained by Suri dhows at the French Consulate in Zanzibar, then a British Protectorate, and on the 4th May, 1897, Commander Hoskyns, of His Majesty’s ship “ Blonde,” which was cruising on the Zanzibar coast for the repression of the Slave Trade, reported that thirty-eight dhows had changed from Muscat to French nationality at the French Consulate at Zanzibar, and had obtained permission to carry passengers. In May of that year the Sultan of Muscat had addressed to M. Ottavi, the French Consul in Muscat, a protest against the grant by the French authorities in Aden and Africa of French flags to Omanis. To the protest the Consul replied by the unfounded statement that the practice had existed for forty years, and had been accepted by the Sultan. Further correspondence ensued, the Sultan pressing his protest and the French Consul main taining his contention that only French officers could interfere with dhows carrying French flags. In 1896 His Majesty’s ship “Sphinx” stopped three dhows at sea near the Oman coast at a point supposed, at the date of seizure, to be on the hio-h seas, but afterwards ascertained to be within the territorial waters of Oman. On one the papers were found in order. The other two contained slaves, and were seized and brought into port, and, after a claim by the French Consul, w T ere handed over to him, and the captains were ultimately tried at Reunion and convicted of slave-trading. One of these dhows, the “Salama,” was captained by Abdullah-bin-Mohammed Baluch, an inhabitant of Abu Abal’s, on the Batineh coast, 50 miles from Muscat and in the territory of the Sultan. The vessel was owned by Hamed-bin-Abdullah Baluch, of the same place. The French litre de navigation was issued at Zanzibar and describes this Ahmed-bin-Abdubah as residing at Majunga, and the licence was to ply on the coasts of Madagascar [1413] Eand adjoining islands, and to have a foreign crew. It was issued at Zanzibar. In 1899 the Sultan wrote to the then French Consul at Muscat informing him that he did not recognize the right of France to exercise juris diction over his subjects residing in or visiting his dominions, whether they were in possession ot French papers or not, and that the practice of granting French protection to his subjects at Sur was contrary to the Declaration of 1862 (ante, p. ), and at the same time he also wrote to the head of the Jennebeh tribe at Sur recommending them to return their French flags, and adopt the original red Arab flag. Following up the policy indicated by the Declaration of 1899, the Sultan, in June 1900, paid a visit to Sur, and there conferred with the chief men of Sur and those of his subjects there who held French flags and papers. The result of the Conference was a written undertaking signed by these persons to return any French flags held by them at the beginning of the coming year, which undertaking was formally accepted by the Sultan, who, on the 15th June, 1900, issued a notification warning his subjects against taking flags and papers from foreign Governments whereunder they claimed so-called protection. Three sets of French papers were at once surrendered ; copies of tlmse ships’ papers surrendered on this occasion are given in the Appendix. Their examination discloses the following facts :— No. A is called a renouvellement, which indicates that the applicant, Rashid-bin-Khamis, must have had papers before and let them lapse ; otherwise the Consul would have endorsed the papers “ prolongation,” as appears to have been done two years later at Zanzibar. Moreover, tbe place of residence is omitted, though its insertion is clearly required by Articles XXXII and XXXIV of the Brussels Act. No. B contains no proper description of the vessel to distinguish it from the numerous Arab dhows bearing the same common name and of the same tonnage. In this titre also the proteghs’ residence is omitted. The proprietor is stated to be also proprietor of the “ Saad-el-Kerim,” which may refer to another vessel with French papers, but affords no sufficient indication of qualification to hold French papers. No. C, like No. B, contains no indication of the residence of the ship-owner, and merely states See No. 30 in 216, p. 95, on ray file exact text wanted June 30,1900, Cox, No. 5 in 49, file, p. 51.

His actual residence was at Suweik, a small port on the Batineh coast of Oman. It is further to be observed that these titres were all granted or renewed by French Consuls at Muscat or Zanzibar, and not by the officers of French Colonies or Protectorates ; and it is also to be noted that the titre permits the employ ment of a foreign crew, which militates against any contention that the crew can be considered as French proteges. At the time of the Sultan’s visit to Sur all the Suri vessels except one were laid up in harbour for the monsoon season, and though at least those owned by the persons in the list given in the Appendix No. claimed to sail under the French flag, only fifteen or sixteen had on them any names or numbers as required by Article XXXIV of the Brussels Act, and on even these vessels the names were not inlaid as required, but so dis posed on the quarter that they could be easily removed or erased. The French titres above referred to were sent by the Sultan to M. Ottavi, who declined to receive them, and visited Sur to inquire into the circumstances attending their surrender, and the French authorities have since that date continually questioned rhe correctness of the Sultan’s action so far as it relates to French papers granted to his subjects before the date of his visit to Sur. On the 26th June, 1900, M. Gambon, the French Ambassador in London, gave to the British Minister of Foreign Affairs an assurance that no certificates would be recognized which had been granted for the first time to subjects of the Sultan after that date, and that the existing papers would be carefully examined. The Naval Commander sent for this purpose on the “ Drbme ” would seem to have directed his attention mainly to intimidating the Sultan into returning to the dhow owners the titres already surrendered, and a similar policy seems to have been followed by the Commander of the “ Catinat,” which visited Sur in December 1900. On the 11th February, 1902, by the direction of the British Government, the British Consul atMuscat addressed to M. Laronce, then French Consul there, a protest against the assertion of any claim by France “to exercise jurisdiction in Muscat territory and territorial waters over certain w born and domiciled Omani subjects of His Highness, to whom French flags and litres de navigation had been issued by ofiicials of the French Government. This protest was evoked by official communica tions made by the French Consul on the 14th and 23rd January, 1902, in which he clamed to exercise jurisdiction over certain Omanis on the strength of their possessing French flags and papers. Nos. . The text of the correspondence is given in the February 11.1902: . j. w February 12,1902: Appendix. February 14.1902: In the final letter the French Consul wrote— February 16.1902; file. pp. 100. 101 a. .4 xt- * - i i-. i r— t * ... . .

Fran^aise: nous revendiquons settlement le droit que nous contere 1'Acte de Bruxelles, c est-a-dire un droit de surveillance et de police sur les boutriers qui portent notre pavilion.’' Upon this statement it is necessary to observe that the Consul places reliance, not upon the Treaty of 1844, upon which his jurisdiction over Omani subjects, so far as it exists, depends, but upon the Act of Brussels, as conferring a right of surveillance and police in the waters and territories of another Power which is not a panv to that Act. And it will be seen on reference to the Brussels Act that Article XLII especially reserves the national jurisdiction in the territorial waters of every State. As the result of the inquiries and investigations made by the Agents ot the French Government, M. Cambon, the French Ambassador in London, Appendix. No. on the 14th August, 1901, presented a Memo randum expressing the views of the French Government on the question. This was sent to the British Consul at Muscat for report, and the substance ol his Report was embodied in a Memorandum handed b\ L &gt;rd Lsnsdowne to Appendix. No. M. Cambon on the 16th April, 1902.

From that date for a time the controversy rested. But in the year 1903 two events happened v Inch ultimately revived the controversy and conduced to the present arbitration. Abdulla-bin-Salem, Chief of the Gafiri Arabs, resident at Sur, was engaged in a tribal war with a section of another Arab tribe. Finding that his opponents were receiving supplies through Sur, the Chief levied a fine on the town, and forbade native vessels to leave until the Headmen had paid the fine. Mubarak-bin-Hamed Fazaiki owned a dhow, foi which he had taken out papers in the name of his son, Khamis-bin-Mubarak, and flew the trench flag. Both he and his son were residents in Sur, and subjects of the Sultan. To avoid his tribal liability, Mubarak expressed his intention of taking his ship out, and on his persisting some of Abdulla-bin-Salem’s men fired on the vessel, and a shot went through the flag. this incident was made the ground of a claim by the French Consul on the Sultan for an indemnity of 1,500 dols. The claim was chal lenged by tne British Consul, and was withdrawn or postponed. On the 8th April, 1903, the British mail steamer “ Chindwara,” from Bombay, arrived off Muscat, having on board, among other passengers, five Arabs, all natives of and residents at Sur. Their names were :— 1. Saeed-bin-Mubara\-bin-Rashid, of the Faris section of the Jennebeh tribe. 2. Mosallim-bin-Sultan,.of the Mukanna section of the same tribe. 3. Abdulla-bin-Khamis-bin-Ali, of the same sec tion of the same tribe. 4. Salem-bin-Abdulla-bin-Khamis, son of No. 3. 5. Khalfan - bin - Hamed - bin - Muhammed Wad Belan, of the same section of the same tribe. Bombay being an infected port, the ship was subjected to the quarantine laws of the Sultan of Muscat. Nos. 1 and 2, who were deck passengers, on landing were sent to Haramah, the Sultans quarantine station, about 3 miles from Muscat. Nos. 3, 4, and 5, who were second-class passen- [1413] FI 1 .1 dBJ 20 gers, were not sent to the quarantine station, but were allowed by the Sultan’s Health Officer to go on shore, under orders to report daily at the hospital for one week for medical inspection. No. 4 offered money to Ali Sahnar, the Sultan s Quarantine Superintendent, not to send Nos. 1 and 2 to the quarantine station. On the 9th April, N&lt;&gt;s. 3, 4, and 5 came to the hospital, and, after medical inspection, sa’.d : ‘‘We want to go away to-day. but Ali Salmar said to them : “It is impossible; wait and see if the doctor will let you go a day or two before the time On the same evening these three men hired a badan, and sailtrd away in it without leave at dusk in company with Khamis-biu-Mubarak Razeiki and two askaris, besides the master and crew. The vessel did not flv the French flag, and belonged to Taiwi, a port in Oman, between Muscat and Sur. About 8 p.m. Nos. 1 and 2 escaped from the quarantine station, and joined the badan at Bunder Jisseh, seven miles from Muscat, on the morning of the 10th April. Their escape was reported by the Superintendent of the quarantine station, and led to the discovery that Nos. 3, 4, and 5 had also escaped. The Sultan, on learning of the breach of quaran tine, communicated with his Health Officer and with Major Cox, the British Resident, and the latter, on the joint request of the Sultan and his Health Officer (tiie Sultan at that date not having any steam-vessel of his own), applied to the captain of His Majesty’s ship “ Perseus ” for the use of a steam-launch to pursue the badan. The launch travelled down the coast with the Super intendent of the quarantine station on board, and ultimately sighted the badan near Ras Abu Daud. The vessel ran ashore, and the five Arabs were arrested on the shore and taken back to Muscat. The crew and the other passengers on the badan were not interfered with. On the arrival of the five Arabs at Muscat, they were taken before the Health Officer, who resides at the British Consulate, and at the request of the Sukan were detained in the guard- room of the Consulate during the night of the 10th April, and on the llih April the Sultan wrote to Major Cox thanking him for the capture of the Arabs, and asking for their further detention at the Consulate. On the same day thev were handed over to officers of the Sultan and taken back to the quarantine station to complete their21 “ Persia and Arabia.” May 16, Section 1, inclosure 7 in No. 1.

On the same day the French Consul, M. Dor- ville, wrote to Major Cox complaining of the imprisonment by him of three French prot&lt;%£s who had contravened the Quarantine Regulations. Major Cox replied that five Suri subjects of the Sultan had broken quarantine, and that M. Dor- viile should address himself to their Sovereign.

The Sultan replied on the 12th April, stating his intention to punish the five Arabs for breaking quarantine, and repeating his protest against the contention that the French flag covered any of his subjects while on his territory or territorial waters, and saying that he would be content to have the question settled by discussion and decision of Great Britain and France. On the 15th April the Sultan tried the five Arabs for breaking quarantine and sentenced them to three months’ imprisonment. The Sultan’s action was challenged by the French Consul and the Commander of the French war-ship “ Infernet,” and supported by the British Government ; and after discussion between the British and the French Governments, the questions raised by the incident were ulcimately referred to the arbitrament of the Tribunal by the Com- promis printed at p. of this Case. On the 11th April, 1903, the Sultan of Muscat requested M. Dorville, then French Consul at Muscat, to furnish him with a list of the names of those persons whom the French Government claimed to protect in the Sultan’s territories, explaining in each case upon what the right of the individuals to be considered under French prolection was based. This request was refused, but on the 13th May, 1903, at an interview with Lord Lansdowne, M. Cambon, the French Ambassador in London, said that the French Government had been quite ready to fall in with the British suggestion to the effect that a list of persons possessing French flags should be prepared, and that such a list had, in fact, been made out and would have been delivered to the Sultan when the quarantine incident arose. Up to the date of the filing of this Case such lists have not been delivered, and the British22 Government reserves its rights as to examin ing and verifying them. The delivers' of such lists would enable His Highness the Sultan to Cox to India obtain an examination and written explanation of 8 ^ the grounds on which each titre de navigation or 1902, 101b. flag was given, and to indicate to the French Government the cases in which its officers had been induced, by misstatements as to the nation ality and real domicile of the flagholder, to grant such titres and flags to subjects of the Sultan who had no title to become French proteges.ARGUMENT.

The facts above stated indicate the acts by French officials which form the ground of com plaint by the Sultan and the British Government. It remains to consider their juridical quality. The Sultan ol Muscat, like every other inde pendent Sovereign, is entitled to police his own wafers for the enforcement of his own laws and to secure compliance with his Treaties with foi eign Powers, and this sovereign right includes that of enforcing Quarantine Regulations and suppressing the Slave Irade ; and, in the absence of special Conventions, no foreign Power is entitled to exercise any police powers at all in the Sultans waters ; and the Sultan is further, as an independent Sovereign, entitled to exercise full jurisdiction over all persons within his terri tory, except so far as by Treaty, usage, or sufferance he has conceded to a foreign State the privilege of exterritoriality for its subjects or for persons whom he recognizes as proteges of such foreign Power. Among Christian Powers the privilege of ex territoriality is conceded only in favour of the Heads of foreign States, persons of the Corps Diplomatique, and the members of their family or household, and foreign public vessels. In the case of Oriental Powers in Asia and Africa, capitulations and Treaties have been made with Christian Powers, admitting within the ter ritories of such Oriental Powers a special Con sular jurisdiction over subjects of the Christian Power there resident, and, de titre grncieux, over subjects of other Christian Powers which have no Consuls in the Oriental State, and also to a qualified and varying extent over the subjects of the Oriental Power in the service of subjects of such Christian Power. The history of the privileges of the latter class has to a very great extent been a history of their abuse, and in the Ottoman Empire—the most considerable of the Mussulman States— the rights of a Christian Power to take Otto man subjects under its protection were narrowly restricted by Regulations of 1863 and 1865, fully accepted by Christian Powers as consti tuting the reasonable limits for such protection ; [1413] Gand the concurrence of the chief Powers of Europe in this view is fully expressed in Article IX of the Treaty of Peace between Turkey and Greece of the 22nd November (4th December), 1897, and ^ tate J^ a P ers - \ / Vol. XC, p. 427. in the Award made on the 21st March, 1901, with ^ ward respect to the subiect of protection by Greece in M^monal . Diplomatique, the Ottoman Empire. 1901 , P p. 279, 298. The rights of France in Muscat, as defined by the Treaty of 1844, are limited to the protection of French citizens there, and of Omani subjects, who are actually in the service of such French citizens, and do not confer on the Consuls of France any jurisdiction over any subject of the Sultan who is not actually and bund fide in French service in Muscat. [The Sultan of Muscat has always been prepared to accept French jurisdiction as attaching to subjects of a Christian Power not having a Consul at Muscat, who have registered themselves at the French Consulate there, and] by reading the most-favoured-nation clause of the Treaty of 1844 with the terms of the British Treaty of 1891, France may be considered as entitled to include among her proteges in Muscat— 1. Natives of places in Africa or the Indian Seas which are French Protectorates, provided that such natives were subjects of the protected States at the time when the Protectorate was established, and were domiciled in these States. [2. Subjects of non-Christian Powers, not having a Consulate in Muscat, who are actually in the service of French citizens in Muscat.] To the extent above stated, and no further, do the Treaties derogate from the recognized rule of international law that one State is not entitled to extend its protection over the subjects of another, except— 1. In its own territories. Foreign Office, 2. Elsewhere, with the assent of the Sovereign Au g ,lst 18 9S- of the protected person. The Muscat Treaty of 1844 contains no sur render of the Sultan’s right of police over bis Salisbury to waters, and grants no right to France to exercise june^sfSl that police. The only privilege with respect to file &gt; P- 8 - French vessels is that contained in Article X of the Treaty, which accords them the treatment of the most favoured nation in the ports of Muscat, and the terms of this concession do not involve the right to break the Sultan’s Quarantine Regulations or to carry on the Slave Trade in the Sultan’s territory or territorial waters.Appendix, No. May 19. 1903, file, p. 155. The qualified exterritoriality granted by the Treaty is a concession to the difference between Western and Eastern conceptions of law and justice, and is not in any way intended to enable Trance to interfere between the Sultan and his own subjects in any case not specifically provided for in the Treaty. And the text of the Treaty has not been supplemented, varied, or enlarged in this respect by any recognized or established usage, permitting Trance to exercise either concurrent or exclusive jurisdiction over the Sultans subjects in his terri tories or in his territorial waters. On the 19th May, 1903, the French Ambassador in London stated “that the Treaty of 1844 was not designed to meet the case of those owners of dhows whose rights, he said, were in many cases anterior to the date of the Treaty ; that the French flagholders were altogether outside the Treaty, and that protection was claimed for them not under the Treaty, but because they had been given French papers and were entitled to fly the French fiag.” It is difficult to comprehend the principle upon which such a claim could be based. It involves an assertion of the right of France spontaneously to create as many proteges as it chooses in Muscat by grant of French papers and flags to any foreigner who applies for them, and as it admittedly does not rest on any specific Treaty with Muscat, the claim is equally applicable to the subjects of any European Power in the territories of their natural Sovereign—a contention which no civilised State would for a single moment admit. In truth the contention seems to be based on a confusion of ideas and a mistaken notion that Christian Powers are entitled in Oriental States to create classes of protected Orientals without reference to any Treaty or capitulation, and to force on the Rulers of those States, with respect to their own subjects, the municipal laws of France. It is not admissible in the case of Muscat to base any claim to French protection on the fact that the protege has acquired a domicile on French territory, which is not the equivalent of nation ality, or that, either in good or bad faith, he has acquired immeubles in a T rench Colony or Protectorate. The maritime laws of France appear not to con template the grant of French papers to vessels i j 4: 126 unless at least half the vessel is owned by French citizens. And Article XXXII of the Brussels Act cannot be interpreted as extending or giving any wider scope to these laws. That Article recognizes the principle that it would be an abuse to grant the national Hag indiscriminately to native vessels, and operates to restrict internationally the right of Powers which have accepted it to cover by their flag native crafo in the Indian Seas, and is Foreign Office to i • i • i , • / Gave. November obviously aimed at preventing the very mischiet 8 created by the practices detailed on pp. of this Gave, September Case. In other words, the aim of the Article was to 1 insure that no native vessel should fly the flag of a Signatory Power unless it satisfied the conditions laid down in the Article, and that native vessels which were not, by reason of the status of their owners as actual subjects or bond fide proteges of a Signatory Power, should have to resort to the flag of any of the native States to which their owners belonged. The effect of the action of French officials has been to enable Arabs of independent States or tribes not belonging to any French Colony or Protectorate to wrap them selves in the tricolour, and thereby to claim the right to escape on the high seas from search under Article XLII of the Brussels Act, and in the waters, or in the territory, of the State to which they belonged, notwithstanding the saving clause in that Article, to claim exterritoriality and independence of their own lawful Sovereign, and to deleat his efforts to enforce his own laws and Treaty obligations to suppress their nefarious occupation. The saving clause in Article XLII of the Brussels Act expresses the universally established rule of international law as to the jurisdiction of a State within its own territorial waters. It is idle to contend that France, by reserving her assent to the Article, has given herself larger powers of police and surveillance in the waters of other States than would be acquired by those Powers which have accepted Article XLII, and it is to be further noted that Muscat not being a party to the Brussels Act, France cannot, by virtue of these Articles of the Act which she has accepted, claim the exercise of any rights in the dominions or territorial waters of the Sultan, whose obligations, always fully recognized to sup press the Slave Trade, are defined by the Treaties A ppenhhc. with Great Britain already referred to, and not by the Brussels Act.The terms of the second paragraph of Article XXXII of the Act are inconsistent with the practice of granting permits at French Consulates in foreign States because the proof of possession of immeubles there referred to clearty relates to immeubles within the territory and jurisdiction of the French authority granting the permits which cannot exist in foreign States in which the French only have Consulates. See Wheaton and Atlay, 1904, J&gt;. 171, citing K. r. Anderson, L. R.K.C.K. 161, and li. v. Dudley, U Q.B.D., 273. Assuming, for the purposes of the present Case, that by the grant of French papers to the Omani owner of an Arab dhow the vessel and the recipient of the papers acquire privileges and incur obligations within French waters and on the high seas, those rights depend solely on French municipal law, and so soon as the vessel and its owner and crew return within the territorial waters of Muscat there is nothing in the recognized mles of international law or in Treaties already quoted which renders the vessel, its owner, or crew entitled to privileges as a French vessel. Where the title of the Omani owner to fly the French flag is questioned by his Sultan, it is not enough for a French official to assert that the man is a protege, or to show that he or his ship is re gistered at the Consulate or has French papers. The claim to privilege must be warranted by the facts and brought within the relevant Treaty. The papers of many of these vessels contain a clause permitting the vessel to be manned by foreigners, which has the effect of displacing any presumption which might otherwise have arisen that the crew of such a vessel under the French flag were Frenchmen, and of making it necessary in each case to show that members of the crew were, independently of the titre, either French men or natives of French Colonies or Protectorates, or in the service of Frenchmen. Great respect is, of course, due to the declara tion of a responsible officer of France with respect to persons claimed as French proteges. But subjects of Oman who claim such a privilege or exemption must prove that they are entitled to it under some Treaty, and when the facts of their birth, nationality, residence, and occupation are perfectly well established, it is impossible that such facts can be countervailed by a declaration that they are registered in the French Consulate or have obtained French papers while outside Oman. The only result of such a declaration is to [1413] H28 entitle the Saltan to invite France immediately to investigate the circumstances under which her officials have permitted unqualihed persons to obtain the semblance of being French citizens or proteges, and to have the claimants at once struck off any Consular register on which they appear, and deprived of any F'rench flags or papers which they have wrongfully obtained. It is possible that some confusion may have been caused on this subject by reference to diplomatic communities. When diplomatic ex emption from territorial law is claimed, the declara tion of the accredited State is in most, if not all, cases conclusive of the quality of the person, of which it has the best means of knowledge, and the only remaining question is whether the Embassy has been accepted by the State to which it is accredited. In the case of a claim by a native of a country to be a protege of a foreign Power, otherwise than by virtue of service to a diplomatic officer, the natural presumption is against such privilege, and the officers of the protecting State, while they may be able to say that they have regis tered the claimant or done acts purporting to give him protection, must go further, and show in what quality and under what Treaty or principle of international law the claim can be justified. To admit the absolute right of a foreign State to conclude by its declaration the question whether anj^ person was, or was not, its protege, would enable it to transfer to its pro tection masses of a foreign population residing in their own country, and to create semi-independent communities within the borders of a friendly State. Indeed, this is precisely what has resulted at Sur from the action of French officials in Muscat, and constitutes a grave attack upon the independence of the Sultan of Muscat. And, even assuming a limited jurisdiction in the French Consul to decide questions arising between the captain and crew of an Omani vessel flying the French flag, this jurisdiction does not render either captain or crew French proteges so as to withdraw them from the justice of their Sovereign in matters not relating to the contract of sea service. The same rule is applicable as in the case of a foreign merchant ship in the waters of any European State. The crew are justiciable in such State for anything there done (with the possible exception of the matters arising out of their contract of sea service , and if one of the1837. See Hertslet, Africa by Treaty, 287. crew is a subject of the State where the ship lies, its flag does not alter his nationality nor his consequent liabaity to the laws of his natural Sovereign. If a French criminal were found among the crew of a foreign merchant-ship in a French port, the jurisdiction of the French authorities to arrest and try him would be internationally indis- putable. There is also a further risk of confusion from the somewhat equivocal meaning of the word protege. ’ During the many controversies which have arisen as to proteges in the Mediterranean, there was, until recent years, no question of Pro tectorates in the modern sense of that term. European Powers in the Levant protected many non-subjects, but this exercise of protection rested on arrangement with the Porte, and not in 'f ^orial Protectorate. At the time of the lea ^J W1 th Muscat France had no territorial Protectorates, and the policy of Protectorates is of modern origin, not receiving international acceptance until the Berlin Act. Since 1880, France has acquired many Protectorates and spheres of influence in Africa. The status of occupants of such territories has not yet been settled by international consensus. But inas much as the existence of a Protectorate puts the foreign relations of the protected States into the hands of France, it is easy to admit that subjects of the potentates who have admitted a Protec torate should, in foreign countries, he given the position of French citizens, although they may not acquire full civic rights in France itself. But it does not follow from this concession that natives of other countries who resided in the Protectorates when established as natives of the Protectorate who had ceased to reside in them before the establishment are in any way brought under allegiance to France or acquire any title to protection by France as against their natural Sovereign or the Sovereign of the State in which they have settled. Still less does it follow that, because a foreigner chooses to go into a French Colony or Protec torate and build a house or declare that he shall domicile there, France may at once naturalize him without the assent of his Sovereign or on the strength of his domicile give h'm papers consti tuting him a French protege in his own. native country. A foreign settler in a Protectorate is [1413] Ientitled to the protection of French laws while there, but not to carry French laws back with him to his native country when he chooses to return thither, and the test of protection by domicile is peculiarly inappropriate to Mussulman sailors, who, to the ordinary proclivities of sea faring men, add the polygamous habits of their faith, and may have a residence and a lawful wife at every port which they frequent during the sailing season, while they return to their native country and real domicile during that period of the year in which it is unsafe or unusual to ply their occupation. y The case of the quarantine-breakers—which is the latest—is also the boldest instance of the French claim. The men did not arrive at Muscat under the French flag, and did not run away from their quarantine in a vessel flying the French flag. The sole ground of the privilege claimed was that they had at some time sailed in such a vessel or obtained French papers in connection with such a vessel. They were confessedly Suri subjects of the Sultan resident in his dominiuns. A claim by the subject of a European Power to defy the Quarantine Regulations of his own State on the ground that he owned, or had sailed in, a ship registered in France would at once be scouted as inconsistent with every principle alike of municipal and international law, and in the absence of a Treaty with Muscat specifically varying the ordinary rules of jurisdiction, the claim put forward by France has no juridical substance. Upon the facts and arguments hereinbefore stated, it is submitted on behalf of Great Britain that the Tribunal should come to the following conclusions :— ]. No subject of the Sultan of Muscat acquires any right to the status of a French protege under the Treaty of 1844 by the fact that he is the owner, captain, or a member of the crew of a native vessel which has, by whatever means, obtained French papers or flag. ii. By her adhesion to the XXXIInd Article of the Brussels Act of 1890, France is under an international obligation not to grant French flags or papers to any native vessel unless its owner, at the time of grant, is (o) a French citizen, or is (6) a French protege by reason of his being a subject of a State under French protection. 3. France is equally debarred by the Declara- M. Cambon seems to concede this; but a decision of the Tribunal would be better than a concession, which might be explained as qualified.

No subject of the Sultan, by accepting French papers or flags, acquires any immunity from the Sultan s jurisdiction in the territories or territorial waters of Oman either for himself or for the crew of any ship commanded or owned by him or for any member of his family or for any of his employes. 5. France should, with all reasonable dispatch, erase from its marine registers all native vessels owned by subjects of the Sultan of Muscat, and, in co-operation with the Sultan, should take steps to obtain the surrender of all French flags and papers now held by any such subjects. 6. In all cases in which France still claims as subjects or proteges any owner or captain of a native vessel hailing from Oman, she should, with all reasonable dispatch, furnish to the Sultan any proofs on which she claims that such owner or captain is not a subject of the Sultan, but is a subject or protege of France. f * J tf-'-Ui, l'v&lt;r'r (yi.

The chief grounds upon which we object to the French issue of flags and papers in Oman are that such procedure in the case of the Sultan’s sub jects tends to undermine his independence. The French appear from the record to have tried to get out of this difficulty either by making the person desiring protection buy property in a French colony valued at $. 200, or by causing him to supply personal security offered by French protected person either resident in such colony or in Oman. And these are alluded to as being the “certain conditions necessary” for the issue of French protection in defence of which Mons. Ottavi could find nothing better to say than that they are sanctioned by long continued custom and usage. 3 . It is evident that the French Government have been none too ready to fulfil their promise to supply us with the list of dhow-owners supposed to be entitled to protection. Their object in delaying can only he to do what is possible to prevent our knowing exactly the grounds upon which protection is granted in each instance, and so to place a formidable obstacle in the way of our making a clear statement of the Sultan’s position. 4 . I beg respectfully to suggest therefore that pressure be put upon them to supply such list as soon as possible, in order that I may have an opportunity of discussing with the Ruler of Oman the circumstances under which protec tion has been afforded to each individual, and subsequently of submitting a clear statement to Government. 5.

I SIGNED with the French Ambassador to-day the terms of reference to The Hague Tribunal in the case of the matters in dispute between the British and French Govern ments with regard to Muscat. The documents having been signed, his Excellency observed that His Majesty’s Government had asked to be furnished by the French Government with a list of the owners of dhows entitled to fly the French flag. As to this, he wished to remind me that at one moment the French Government had put forward a series of proposals for an amicable settlement of the difficulties which had arisen between us. It was a part of this proposal that a list of the kind which I had mentioned should be put in by the French Government. We had, however, declined to accept the proffered terms, and had proposed as an alternative recourse to arbitration by the Tribunal at The Hague. In these circumstances it seemed to M. Delcasse that the French Government were no longer called upon to furnish the list. I said that I was not aware that the proposal had ever been dropped, and that I had always understood that the list was to be furnished whether we went to arbitration or not. In the circmnstances I preferred to express no opinion upon the subject until I had refreshed my memory by reference to the correspondence. I am, &amp;c. (Signed) LANSDOWNE.

Dear Monsieur Geoffray:- I write to you at Lord. Lansdowne’s de sire to enquire what progress is being made in compiling the list which is to be furnished to the Sultan of Muscat of all subjects of His High ness possessing permits to fly the French flag. You will no doubt recollect that Mon sieur Gambon infomed Lord Lansdowne in May 1903 during the discussions which preceded the agree ment to refer to arbitration the questions con nected with Muscat, that the list would be speed ily prepared. We have lately' received corres pondence from the Goveniment of India from which it appears that considerable Inconvenience is experienced owing to the want of definite infor mationinfomiation as to the persons who have been spec ifically authorized hy the French Government to fly the French flag and Lord Lansdowne wishes me to say that he hopes to he furnished on his ap proaching return with the list promised in May of last year.* l; !

In continuation of my secret telegram of 26th and 27th instant in con nection with Debai, I have the honour to state that on Friday last during a visit which I paid to the Saltan, His Highness shewed me the letter referred to 1Ill from the French Consul to Shaikh Maktoom of Debai. Its contents were briefly that the case against the Debai people was clear, that the Shaikh had not replied to the French Consul’s former letter, and.that he must now pay up com pensation without further loss of time. Hie letter contained no definite threats, but. as I am told by M. Laronce, that he expects the Infernet about the 15th April, and that she will not remain long in Maskat but will proceed up the Gulf, 5 1 think it probable that Dehai may he visited. 2. The owner of the boat referred to is one Salim bin Mahomed bin Ta’eeb of Suwaikh, sixtv miles from Maskat, one of the French flag-holders. The French Consul's letter was sent to the Sultan under flying seal with enclosure (1) and His Highness asked me for advice as to whether he should send it on or not, I pofnted out to him that as the claimant was one of his subjects, the claim should be made through him, and not through the representative of a Foreign Power, and after some conversation he decided to return the letter to the French Consul with enclosure (2), which was done. It is evident that the French object was to obtain from the Sultan a tacit acquiescence in their interference in the internal affairs of his country, by using him as a medium for the despatch of the letter. I might have persuaded His Highness to word his reply more strongly, but as the matter of the French flag is under settlement, it appeared that for him simply to decline to be used as a medium would be best in his present position. Z. Neither His Highness nor I are in possession of any further particulars connected with the Trench claim against Sheikh Maktoom. Enclosure I.

In reply to my enquiry how the information reached him, Grey telegraphs that the Sultan of Maskat showed him strongly worded letter from French Consul to Sheikh of Debai which French Consul had asked him to send. This letter, which contains reference to previous despatch, is apparently ignored by Sheikh. I think that French Consul is not aware of relations between us and the Trucial Chiefs, and, with your approval, I propose to instruct Consul at Maskat informing French Consul that the Trucial Chiefs are precluded from corresponding with other than ourselves, at the same time expressing willingness to make enquiry and do all in my power to settle matter if particulars are furnished.

Grey, His Britannic Majesty's Consul and Political Agent, To— L. W. Dane, Esq., Secretary to the Government of India m the Foreign Department. I have the honour to refer to my No. 136, dated 28th March last, with its enclosures, and to state that I visited Debai on the 28th ultimo in H M S Lapwing, in order to make enquiries into the matter in question. 2. I find that there is no question of plundering. The two boats arrived off Debai in the morning of the day (some eight months ago) on which the ac cident took place. A strong gale was blowing, and on their attempting to enter the narrow Khor or channel towards evening, the Fath-ul-Khair which was leading suddenly swerved across the bows of the Debai boat and stuck in the shallow sandy bottom of the channel. The Debai Captain was unable in the storm to turn his boat in time, and a collision took place which resulted in the loss of the Eath-ul-Khair, she being struck by her companion’s bows. The Captain of the Fath-ul-Khair sold what was left of his ship and her implements and returned to Suwaikh and Maskat where he obtained letters from His Highness the Sultan and the Wali of Suwaikh addressed to Shaikh Maktum of Debai asking for enquiry to he made and satisfaction given. He then returned to Debai. 3. Shaikh Maktum, as is usually done in such cases, referred the matter to a religious court, and it was ultimately arranged as shewn in the document, of which a translation is attached. The document is authentic, and there is no doubt that the owner of the Eath-ul-Khair agreed to the amount of compensa tion awarded to him and that he signed the paper. 4. Subsequently, it appears, he forwarded to Shaikh Maktum a letter from the French Consul demanding further compensation, and Monsieur Laronce evidently took up the matter without being in possession of all the facts. I hope to be able to shew him how matters stand and induce him to desist from further action, as it is evident that justice has been done as far as possible. With this object I hope to proceed to Soor in H.M.S. Sphinx during this week, and will inform you as to the result of my interview with him. Enclosure No. I. In the name of God } the Merciful, the Compassionate. Let every one who comes across this paper (of the Muslim doctors, etc.) know that Ali bin Salim bin Mahomed bin Ta’eeb and Abdulla bin Saloom appeared before us. The aforesaid Ali bin Salim claimed from the aforesaid Abdulla that he had been the cause of the destruction of his boat which had stuck in the mouth of the Debai Channel. The aforesaid Abdulla denied this in the presence of the Qazi and a company of Mussalmen, so the Qazi demanded from Ali bin Salim lawful proof which he was not able to supply, then it came to Abdulla to swear (his innocence). We arranged peace between them for 300 dollars and they agreed to this of their own free wills, they were not com- pelled in the matter, neither did they agree unwillingly. Abdulla paid up the aforesaid money and Ali bin Salim took it, and there remains no claim or right ful demand in this matter to Ali bin Salim ; let this not be hidden from anyone.need.

Being on leave when the circumstances in question arose I had no oppor tunity of doing so at the time. 2. The existence of a dhow flying the French flag at Suweik on the Batineh Coast of Oman, was recorded in paragraph 7 of my report No. 313 of 18th June 1900 to the Resident in the Persian Gulf and a copy (or photograph) of the dhow’s articles formed enclosure No. 11 to that report, which was for warded to Government under Residency Secret E„ September 1900, Nos. 5-56 (Pro.

The Hague Tribunal is at all events a presumably fair and unbiassed Court. The case will be treated on its merits, and none of the parties concerned can have legitimate cause to complain at the verdict whatever it is. Where is the advantage in upsetting that arrangement now, and giving away to France a locally important case, which we are almost certain to win ? Even if the British Government can get some compensating concession from the French for letting them have their way in this, I cannot see that we have any right to allow the Sultan to go to the wall on our account, and I can assure you that if that contingency should arise, it would do lasting harm to our good name in Oman. I have little doubt that the Government of India have set their faces against the proposal, but I have seen so much of the question, and it has given me so many anxious moments, that it can hardly be wondered at if I feel strongly about it and, perhaps, exaggerate its importance. If the Viceroy were at home one would have no anxiety, but knowing how keen the French Government will be to rush it through, as they have everything to fear from the Hague Arbitration, and knowing that His Majesty’s Government will be in a conciliatory mood owing to the recent happy rapprochement and agreement with France, I cannot help fearing that Maskat interests may go to the wall.

Foreign Office Press—No. 123—234-04—30. v ^Committe SecretaryI 4/y V.— Muscat. Tour telegram, mh March. Owing to absence from Muscat of the Vohtical Agent, it has not been possible to send a reply, lending hts return, we are still without any indication of his views or those of the Sultan. It is also important that Major Cox, who is at present at sea on his way back to India, should be consulted. However, for the following reasons, any arrangement such as that proposed by the French Government is in my opinion, strongly to be deprecated : — (1.) It is hardly possible to cancel the reference to arbitration before the Hague Tribunal without obtaining the consent of the Sultan. It is almost certain that he would object to the solution proposed and would consider that we had surrendered his interests once more. (2.) We do not know what the reciprocal engagement of the bth August 1890 was, and we have no record of it. Renewal of declaration of 1862, at the very^ time when we have been endeavouring to escape from the “ dual control f would seem to be most unfortunate, as it would involve the indefinite postponement of any solution of questions such as we wish for. My telegram of the 26th March. Arrangement seems to us to be altogether one-sided. The French Government offers to furnish, in two months time, complete list of flag-holders, although, on the IHth May last. Lord Lansdowne was informed by the French Ambassador that the list was already prepared. Secondly, the French repeat their promise, which was reported you on the 26ih May last (/), that no more flags will be issued by them without an understanding with the Sultan. In return for the above, we are asked to recognise the right of the French Government to protect, not only the owners of dhows flying the French flag, but also subjects of the Sultan who reside in, or own property in, French Colonies, such protection to be extended to their families and to be exercised both on land on l in the territorial waters. This, it appears to us, would be tantamount to conceding in full the claims of the French, which on the 16th May last Lord Lansdowne said His Majesty's Qovernment were quite unable to understand. With regard to the statement that papers will not he renewed inTlhe event of the title to them being found defective, we are unable to understand whether the proposal is that the papers should be cancelled at the end of the year, or whether the permission would hold good during the lifetime of the flag- holder. Further, we fail to see what protection the French flag-holders require beyond that which the Brussels Act, Article No. 30, et seq., confers upon them. Froposed arrangement would give infinite trouble in the future, and is certain to be regarded locally as a British surrender. It would seem preferable from every point of view to persist in reference to the Hague Tribunal rather than agree to such an arrangement. «From Secretary of State to Viceroy, Foreign Department, ‘Ityth March 1904. Secret. Muscat. French Ambassador in course of general negotiations proposes to substitute for impending arbitration draft Article to following A\^ effect:— Clause 1. Renewal of reciprocal engagements of 10th March 1862 and 5th August 1890. Clause 2. An engagement for the future not to issue French flags to subjects of Sultan without previous understanding with him. His Majesty’s Government, on the other hand, agreeing to recognise French protection of Muscat subjects residing in, or owning property in, French colonies. Clause 3. Proprietors of French protected dhows to be under French protection both on land and at sea; but their immovable property on land to be subject to local laws ; protection to be extended to families in direct descent from French proteges. Clause 4. The masters and crews of French protected dhows to be under French protection only at sea, subject to the provisions of Brussels Act. Clause 5. The French Government to furnish, within two months, a complete list of its Muscat proteges, which will be subject to examina tion. In case the title should in any case be shown to be defective, the French papers will not be renewed. Ho you consider that it would be possible to amend this article in such a manner as to make it acceptable ?

The complete award in English and French can be found at folios 135-141.The papers include reports and discussions on other matters linked to the arbitration case including the limits of Oman territory; the question of ownership of Gwadar; and the legal status and nationality of the Khoja peoples residing within Muscat and Oman.
