The Persian press has never written anything against the British people or Government, declares a Persian newspaper recently* In view of the general tone of the Persian press during the past four months this is a surprising statement and one which emphasises the unusual character of the press of Persia today. There has been and still are countries where the press affords no guide public opinion. In such countries no news or commentary except that provided by the Government or subject to Government censorship is allowed to reach the public. After an initial period of resentment during which independent minded people try to obtain and spread inpartial news by any means in their power, public opinion grows so accustomed to hearing only one point of view that it comes to believe thau iic other point of view worth considering can a exist. The press of such countries I cannot be said to reflect public opinion because in the accepted sense of the term public opinion has ceased to exist# Persia, to foreigners long resident there usually appears/.,....- 2 - appears to be a country of innate convictions reserved from a long tradition of individualism, thought and culture a country of instructive [sic] and dislikes. \ If the Persian press of the past four months is a reflection of Persian opinion throughout the country, it can only be concluded that the Persian people as a whole have decided that the British nation are their enemies they do not wish to trade with them or have any dealings with them, and they therefore propose to alienate them by a steady flow of abuse and accusation* If this is a true description of Persian public opinion the Persian press could be described as free for it would truly reflect the hatred for Britain which Persia has acquired for no discoverable reason since March 1946. In spite, however, of the generally hostile attitude of the press it is difficult for the British residents in Persia to feel that the British people and Government are so much hated as the press would have the Persian people believe they cannot help remarking that many newspapers which ventured to criticise other nations and even dares to find some value in British friendship have for some reason or another ceased publication. As the attacks in question are surprising and even regrettable to them they cannot refrain from wondering when they are pleasing to anyone else. There are some who wen dor why Britain has so far remained silent in the face of these violent and repeated attacks and who would also welcome s ome/........./ V -3- sorae break in their monotony. Such people are inclined to think that a healthy variety would result from a more general expression of views and perhaps pave the way to the realisation of that Anglo-Persian friendship which many Persian statesmen and patriots declare to be their aim. That Britain desires to associate with Persia on terms of friendly equality is certain, but that the present sustained vilification of them in the Persian press will make the British people and Government better disposed towards Persia seems improbably.wmmm ■■HI 5444 I | A * \/ \ fc This telegraiii is fiif.„particular -secrecy and should be retained by the authorised recipient and not passed on] [CYPHER] C.iBL 'mT D ISTRIBUTIU^ FROIa TO FQKEIGi!

The objectionable portions of the article in ques tion, which directly as well as indirectly refer ±x in a de famatory manner to the actions of His Imperial Majesty the Shall and his Government,have been underlined. A notable feature of the article is that its author, for some reasons of his own, has not thought it proper to subscribe his name to it, and by doing so he evidently means to keep himseli in the background. While eulogizing certain social and otner reforms which have been introduced into the country in recent years,the writer has, at the same time, taken upon himself th« fcxk task of unjustifiably criticizing His Imperial Majesty the Shall’s other administrative measures in a language which is clearly of a defamatory character* Among other things the most exceptionable portion of the article in question where the writer says 'Strong-willed, previously healthy followers of the absent Sultan Ahmad Shall, whom Reza Khan later deposed, developed mysterious maladies from which they never recovered' is at once a slander and a deliberate lie spoken of an exalted personality. The statement is cleverly couched in a language which is capable of being understood as weil as other false statements made therein, are all very highly offensive, which fact izi calls for the special and iimiediate attention of the Government of India authorities. without any ambiguity what it really means to convey to the mind of the reader.

The bustling American and European salesmen who made the inaugural trip were delighted that they had been spared the hitherto unavoiaaoie, tecnuUij, 4U-nour jour ney from Bagdad, Iraq to Teheran over Iraq’s slow railroads and Iran’s slower, - often impassable dirt mountain roads. Better still, they had missed having to put up for a night in one of Iran’s in sect-ridden rest houses. What the Pia.ns arrival meant to Miauie Eastern diplomats, however, was that the German-controlled Luf thansa had just won a significant battle wuth British Imperial Air ways over flying concessions. 'SHAduvV op* OUD ’ Formerly divided into spheres of influence by Imperial Russia and Imperial Bri tain, Iran shook off Russian influ ence when Cossack officers retired from the country at the end of the World War, but waited five years for the British-officered South Persia Rifles to disband. With a newiy-crea ed army of 40.fiu0 men, commanded in person by the then Reza Khan, supplied with se condhand rifles, machine guns, tanks, Iran first dealt with her own warring, rebellious Kurds, Kash- gais and Bakhtiaris, then began shaking a determined fist at Great Britain. First real shock to reach Down ing Street from Teheran was ar bitrary cancellation of the Anglo- Persian Oil Co. concession schedul ed to run until 1961. Surprised British statesmen, suddenly realiz ing that protection of this oil lease would involve great military effort and nuge expexic*lures, c - u- ed by negotiating. Anglo-Persian’s basic holdings were enormously decreased and the Shah obtained increased royalties which were promptly earmarked for the army. This Highly successful instrument of national freedom, now 100,000 strong, still receives its daily orders from His Imperial Majesty. Another move was an Iranian 1 hint that His Britannic Majesty’s naval forces in the Persian Gulf were no longer welcome to make their base in Iranian waters. Re sult: The British Naval Base was moved across the Gulf to the oil laden Bahrein Islands, territory of morb tractable, independent H. H. Sheik Sir Hamad bin Tsa al Khalifa, leaving His Britannic Majesty’s diplomatic agent for the Persian Gulf uncomfortably high and dry in Bushire’s British Resi dency. Meanwhile protection- loving Imperial Airways revised its flying route to India, establishing its regular Persian Gulf stop for seaplanes at Bahrein instead of Iranian territory. Since Iran was bent on proving her independence, lean pickings were in store for British advisers, and British business, snips were or-j dered from Italy and Italian offi cers were engaged to teach Iranian landlubbers theories of navigation, j Barter trade was established with Soviet Russian and German goods j began to pour into Iran under a clearing agreement arranged by the wily Dr. Hjalmar Schacht. Among the first arrivals were 100 German warplanes for-the Iranian air foyce. Danes, Czechs, Swedes, Italians, all chipped in to build new beet-sugar factories, power plants, cotton mills. Road build ers arrived from Europe and America and construction com panies were not long in learning that Telr&amp;ran, “City of the Shadow of God,” was to undergo a facial operation. The King of Kings guaranteed prompt payment in foreign cash. lit AN THE NEW By this spring thickly- populated bazaar districts were condemned and destroyed, new, broad, straight avenues plot ted through once narrow, crooked streets. Magnificent, many-room- ed, multi-storied government build ings stood where once sagged an cient one-story huts. A handsome post-office building covering a city block has arisen and a Ministry of War Building, with sufficient space to house the general staffs of Ger many, France and Great Britain at the same time, is being utilized by the ever-expanding but still relatively small Iranian staff. The Imperial Bank of Iran, set back from the street, needed an entire square. Slowly rising to completion is an Imperial Opera House to cater to the hitherto undiscovered i musical tastes of Iran’s citizens. I The shortcomings of the Shah’s dozen years in office, the ludicrous anomalies, misappropriations and mass suffering bring laughter and tears only to the eyes of Western ers. By Crienu.a stan x xa, own, the Shah is the man of his generation in the Middle East. Iranian public building has all been under direct orders of the Shah. He approved plans, altered details. Little did it seem to mat ter to the King of Kings that an arclucct omitted plumbing detail when building a hotel, that Tehe ran’s water supply still came through the streets in half-open, easily contaminated cement drains, that Teheran’s old electric power plant had a limited capacity. When His Imperial Majesty drove at night through a street not sufficiently lighted for his tastes, he ordered more powerful bulbs installed.

Michel d*Armenonville, who knows the Middle East well, here gives a glimpse of the reforms which, unaer the Shah’s personal guidance, are building up a n^w Iran. IRAIn IIn TRANSITION. (By Michel d 1 Armenonville). There has of late been much talk of the n Changing East ! ’ and some have come to believe that Middle Eastern peoples have cast aside all the amiable characteristics which they once had and have assumed a spurious travesty of Western culture and civilisation. European travellers in search either or preconceived ideas of mediaeval romance or of suddenly achieved Western efficiency sometimes declare that they have found neither and that the Middle East is now neither East nor West. Of no country are these mistaken notions more often expressed than of Iran ana those who have lived much in Iran during the height of the transition period, from 1926 onward, have frequently been astonished to hear the statements made by travellers who have made a quick trip through Iran from Zahidan to Kasr-i-Shirin. Some of these people even go to the extraordinary length of supposing that the present condition of Iran is no better or even that it is worse than it was ten or twelve years ago. Reforms a Healthy Sign . Many and great are the changes which have taken place in Iran since the final disappearance of the Q,ajars. Some of these changes are so sweeping as to fill with dismay casual travellers whose knowledge of Iran had hitherto been confined to the contents of the 'Hajji Baba of Ispahan.” That there has been some 'Strain o’ the stuff” and some ’’warpings past the aim' there is no sense in denying. But the reforms, inconvenient though they may be to some, are a healthy sign and they have not obliterated the basic character and amiabilities of the Iranian/ W'A —.tlL-f...2. Iranian people nor have they removed all the peculiar pleasures of life in Iran. Nature has not dealt wholly kindly with Iran. With rare exceptions, all the more pleasing for their rarity, it is an arid country. There are sharp contrasts of climate and geography. I once left Meshed on a mild March morning end spent an almost sultry night in Turbat- i-Haidari. By eleven the next morning I was caught in a howling blizzeira, was snowed up by live and spent the night in a village with the temperature below zero. Yet if the right time of year is chosen and if the traveller knows Persian ana is fortunate enough to have Iranian friends, few things can be more delightful than a long road journey in Iran. Iranian Hospitality: . I well remember travelling a few years ago from Meshed to Tehran and staying a night with Iranian frienas at Sabzevar, Shahrud and Samnan. It was a journey full of humour and interest, well begun with a visit to the tomb of Omar Khayyam at Nishapur. The custodian, a cheerful and witty old man, discussed with aelight the vexed question of why Omar, who is thought to be pretty small beer in Iran, should be so popular in Europe. He had xound the solution, he said, and this was that Omar Khayyam was the only character mentioned both in the Old and the new Testaments.’ Oriental hospitality is proverbial but the Iranian does not only regard hospitality as a principle of liie; he most thoroughly enjoys entertaining and is usually, moreover, an accomplished host. Iranian cooking is original and aelicious and the Iranian host, with genial understanding of European foibles, usually provides a plentiful/3 . plentiful and varied succession of tasty dishes. In less sophisticated circles these are' generally placed in profusion on the aining-table. Security of the Roads . Travelling in Iran, though always pleasant under the right conaitions, was formerly apt to be long and tedious owing to the state of the roads and dangerous on account of low state of security. A very remarkable change has taken place in these matters. Organised supervision of the roaas has resulted in the time taken in travelling being cut down by about a half, while security prevails throughout the country. Most visitors to Iran find life more agreeable in the provinces than in the capital. Tehran has not yet acquired the new character which change ana reform will ultimately give it. It is, however, a place of extraorainary interest. Tehran is haraly a typical Iranian city except on its outskirts, where delightful summers may be spent at Gulahek and Shimran. Nothing is more characteristic of life in Iran than the gardens which surrounu every city. On Fridays Iranians are wont to make up parties to u eat the air” in one of these gardens where there are always trees and running water. Spirit of the People . In his charming book, 'Yaki bud ve Yaki nabud' , Mirza Sayyid Muhammad Ali Khan says of his countrymen that ,T they are very witty ana laughter-loving but they are also very prone to tears.’ 1 Most Iranians do indeed combine a subtle and merry wit with strange depths of deep feeling and poetry. They are sensitive ana proud and even in the ’’bad/4 . ($) 'bad ola days” of the Q,ajars, though there was but little national spirit in Iran, there did exist a kind of social patriotism which bound the Iranians together and made manners and language uniform almost throughout the country. Once a leader was found in Reza Shah Pahlevi, Iranian nationalism found fertile ground where latent cohesion already existed. The key-note of the Shah’s policy has been his deep knowledge of his people’s character. He has always known when to caress and when to chastise and has shown extraordinary restraint in the removal of abuses which might be held to have had a traditional or religious connection. The Shah’s Work for the Army . A professional soluier himself, he has devoted much time and attention to the Army, which he has thoroughly overhauled. His achievement in this will easily stand comparison with similar re-organisations carried out in the post-war years by one or two other countries. The Iranians had no recent military tradition, they had to build an army out of scattered remnants of the Great War. In 1925 the Army was for the most part without boots, was armed with a heterogeneous collection of rifles of varying calibres and their pay was usually not less than three months in arrears. By 1928 these deficiencies had been largely removed, the Army was properly organised, equipped and paid and the foundations of an air force laid. Discipline and regimental tradition haa taken firm root. An entertainment by an Iranian Regiment on a recent anniversary of the Shah's accession began with the singing of the regimental march. Thiswas the preluae to an extremely/5 . extremely funny play acted entirely by soldiers. In the interval there was an excellent supper given by the officers. The play was followed by a fire-works display which would have done credit to the Crystal Palace. Here was a happy, efficient and well-disciplined regiment. Restoration of Oraer . Some people object that the strength and expense of the Iranian Army is out of proportion to the needs of the country but they forget how recently vast tracts of Iran were rendered insecure and unproductive by the preaatory activities of turbulent elements such as the Kurds, Qashgais and Tangestanis. These people have now been subjugated by the Army but their remaining quiet is still probably dependent on the maintenance of the Army at its present strength. Some recent visitors to Iran have complained of the prevailing spirit of xenophobia. While Western Powers can hardly be blamed for taking advantage of the effeteness of the old regime, it would be equally unreasonable to expect the Iranians to take to their bosom, without any arriere pensee , those who but thirty years ago openly divided up their country into n spheres of influence.” Yet the British and Iranian peoples have strange spiritual affinities, not the least of which is an almost identical sense of humour. Still in Transition . Iran, as the Iranians themselves will agree, is still in a state of transition. Much remains to be done gn d it will be some time before new institutions and methods take on that degree of permanency vfaich will enable them to form the framework of the new Iran. Most of what was good/6 . good in the old Iran remains, while what is new is the phenomenon of the whole Iranian nation working together for the good of the country. Life in Iran and the zeal, charm and humour of her people still cannot fail to have their attraction for the sympathetic and unprejudiced visitor.In any further communication on tlii/ subject please quote No - jz. and address —not to any perton bylnam&lt; J\A\i to— ' “The Undersecretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.\Y. 1.

I have the honour to be, »ith the highest respect, *»ir, Tour most obedient, humble Go r/ ant **a K r.j.-a .siuwxrEnglish publioations Spread Poison Our London correspondent sends us unpleasant news this week. According to him matter which is tendentious and unfriendly towards the Imperial nation of Iran is constantly appearing in British publications. Bot a day passes without a book being written by some insignificant tourist or some sort of article being published in one of the newspapers when their quiver is empty,they set about discovering what some Swedish tourist has written about Iran or what some Finnish traveller has noted down in the course of his journey. Then taking this as their basis and foundation magnify it for the purposes of comment t criticism or narrative begin their onslaught and,passing over in silence all the good points,make everything the object of criticism,address it tw. all to us and so insult us. According to our correspondent’s report in all this nonsense which appea rs in the English press under various forms the subject-matter is ooi:mon to all; that is to say there is but one theme and that disparagement of the sacred person of the monarch. To such an extent do they persist in this behaviour, which is contrary alike to reason and courtesy, that any man of experience and sagacity must inevitably regard it as no simple affair, no mere tourists 1 , no mere study of the situation of Iran, and must feel certain that their aims and objects are more profound and more disoretitable than they apparently wish to admit. Othexwise what intelligible explanation is there of the behavian* writers and tourists, who, wishing to describe the situation and condition of a country (however biassed they may be with regard to it) /repeatedlyrepeatedly make the saored person of the monarch the target of their poisoned shafts and hold forth about the noble character and personal genius of one whom we consider glorious because of his great deeds,who is the object of the world’s admiration and respect ? What can it mean but that these selfish and self- satisfied elements which wirh to make the world a sacrifice to their greed are hostile to the growth,development,progress and evolution of Iran and therefore attack that sensitive heart ( ) on which are centred the nation’s thoughts,its activities,its very life ? For one point,which to us is self-evident,is hidden from no one who has the least knowledge of the position and situation of Iran,namely that a life-giving movement has arisen in every walk of the nation’s life,has rescued the country from the position,which the English wished it to occupy,of a buffer-state between India and other European countries,and has transformed it into a nation which,dependent from every point of view on its own will and inspiration al&amp;ne, capable from every point of view of defending its own interests, will no longer serve as a shield to the imperial ambitions of any other power. Moreover the nation knows that this resurrection,this transformation of the iraa of 1919 to the Iran of 1937 is the fruit of the inspiration,the will-power and the devotion of that GREAT who has restored the greatness of Iran, the splendours of the nays of Darius the Great, and has expended every minute and second of his gl^xx^ut* life and the whole of his natural strength in pursuing this saored ambition, this refulgent ideal. Therefore,to disoarage in any way this Royal person, who serves as the inspiring force,as the dynamo of the ship of state,is to disparage the entire population of the country and to insult the whole Iranian nation. We who fully understand the reasons for the /dissatisfaction- 3 - dissatisfaction of the English press lords (or .. these gentle men of the English press) can well account for their anger and resentment. We in no way expect them to he pleased,as are the nations which love justice and peace,at the revival and trans formation of Iran,for they wish the world and especially the Eastern countries to be weaic and impotent,in order that there may be no obstacle to their domination and supremacy; and it is not only of Iran that they think in this way. Since the day that it became clear that the strength of Italy by sea and air had taken from Great Britain her absolute supremacy in the Mediterranean,wrathful anxiety has possessed the whole of England. Certainly in Sngland,as in every other country,are to be found both good and bad qualities and we do not wish to enter into discussion on this point. But there is one quality which in our opinion is one of the most prominent qualities of the English by which the entire civilised world recognises them and that is egoism anf self-satisfaction developed to anextreme and insane degree. This quality is the source of raany other characteristics for which the English are notorious; it is indeed stamped on the pages of their history during the last two or three centuries and is especially prominent in the gloomy history of the colonies belonging to them. From time to time the behaviour and policy of the English in their colonies has come to the notice of learned writers and ^ust men,lovers of justice,and they have been stricken with consternation and amazement that such ruthlessness and lack of mercy could be fou d in human beings..in human beings moreover who claim a place in the community of civilised nations. But it is not surprising that the English allow to the inhabitants xm of their colonies no right of life or tranquility and engage in every sort of tyranny and oppression as a ramtter u* course,because in /themthem egoism has so completely overcome the forces of reason and morality that,aware of no one but themselves,they think that the Almighty has created millions of human beings out of flesh and bone solely to serve their wishes and desires. Is it to be wondered at that people who are so overwhc JLlttWi M. UJ self-love have no liking for the advance of the Iranian nation and seek to disparage and belittle it ?. But our chief complaint against these writers who pour out their nonsense in English newspapers and other communications is that,having cast off the bridle of self-control and self- possession which is the peculiarity of civilised man,they should so far succumb to their emotions that under their sway they should attack and assail that royal person who is the manifesta tion of the Iranian nation.the focus of their thoughts,their will-power and all their activities; for we are afraid..and have good reasons for our fear that if this sort of nonsense is allowe l to continue,and if the bridle of restraint is removed from self-indulgence, then unpleasant results will be produced in Iran and grave consequences may follow in that Anglo-lr&amp;nlan relations may be seriously damaged. Our readers are of course aware that the foreign press was discussed recently in the Majlis and that,at the request of certain deputies,no restriction was placed on the entry of the newspapers and publications containing this sort of rubbish; naturally this nonsense will circulate among the people and we are sure that it will have most injurious effects on the minds of Iranians and it is possiDle that unpleasant consequences may follow from this. Supposing that the policy of the Government does not require that action should be taken in this matter or that any notice or attention should be paid to these idle tales, who then will re-assure us that wise and sensible people will aot in the same way and will not get excited at these poisonous scourgings inflicted on their nerves ?. /nevertheless- 5 jSevartheless,on the strength of the knowledge which we have concerning this people T s ph./cholcgy,we are confident that the opposite will be the case. Iranians are full of forbearance,but not at a moment when attacks are being made on their life,prestige and honour. A history going back five and twenty centuries has given to the people of this nation such sensitiveness,such high spirit and such a pride in their country that they would rather die than submit to insults; especially at an epoch when, having discovered their ideal,they have found a brave and puissant leader who fosters,by the loftiness of his own mind and inspiration,the sentiments and the qualities which are shared by the whole nation. At the present time the Sacred Ruler of Iran is indeed the manifestation,in the full sense of the word,of the thoughts, the ambitions,and the glories of the people; accordingly any disparagement or belittlement of Him amounts to a scourging of the sensory nerve of the people,especially at a time when sovereignty is embodied in the person of tM° qreat man whom the country honours as pioneer,guide,leader,and life-giving chief,as a living monument of the splendours and glories of its past,the representative of twenty-five centuries of Its history. Since the entry of these rubbish; publications is free and since these nonsensical documents,every line of which shows resentment.rancour and spite against the sacred spirit and the sovereignty of this nation,instead of discussing matters impartially,take advantage of every opportunity to make the sacred person of the king the target of their poisoned shafts, we ao not consider it unlikely that the people will take un expected action and,taking no thought for the safe ty of their own lives will,to defend their honour.resort to measures that might be regretted. The thing which particularly increases our anxiety is /the6 the evil record and the bitter .unpleasant impression which Sn&amp;iish policy has always left in this part of the world. We have not forgotten the injuries which Snglish policy has repeatedly inflicted on this country during the last two centuries,nor the evil purposes,the selfish ambit ions, and the covetousness of that Government,nor the diplomacy intended to weaken iran.which it employed in this country in order that there should exist in the Sast of Asia an impotent,poor and needy Iran; nor have we forgotten the treaty of 1907,the aims of 1919 or a hundred other little incidents which are to be found in the history of Anglo-Iranian relations. The whole of this unsavoury record provides a very suitable reason why people should regard these pernicious compositions as poisonous attacks,dictated by self-interest and hostile to their honour and consider them to be the expression of unfriendly policy and to be an attack,the fruit of evil intentions,on the honour and progress of the Iranian nation. tye do not think it necessary at the moment to pursue this rust ter further and shall wait until the newspapers and publica tions in question reach Ii*an. Then we shall enter into the discussion in a comprehensive and detailed manner and refute all their nonsense.&amp; 1 . f\ r 7 A S £ «« ^ any further communication on this subject, olease quote ) ^ No. £ /fath / and address —not to any person by dame, oj/t to “The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W.

The article contained a number of statements that were bound to Incense the Iranian Government, criticisms of the present westernising policy of the Shah, derogatory statements about Cabin t Ministers, descriptions of the pverty of the country, etcetera. Monsieur Sandlani said that particular exception was taken to what he described as the insults to the Shah himself* n this point the article, a copy of which Monsieur Zandjani produced, was not really offensive, for the Shah was said to be 'the right man in the right place*. But he was also described as a small man, and there were in fact many statements in the article which were In bad taste and some His Excellency The Klght Fonourable The Marquess of Linlithgow, K.T., 0.0*1*!., nr® dklhi.A - g - that wt?r* quite Inaccurate. 3. Monsieur Sandjani said that It was the settled policy of the Iranian Government to follow up any publications which they regarded as insulting to Iran. In particular must they do ao when the Shah himself was attacked. he realised that in I ngland it was very difficult to control the press, but he felt that in India the position must be different. He thought that it should be possible for the Government of India to prevent such publications. He added that, even if the paper in question was insignificant the fact that it was published in Quetta, a frontier town through which many Iranians pass, made it important in the eyes of the Iranian Government. He had been instructed to request that the Iranian Government's complaint at the article in question should be conveyed to the Government of India, and to aay that they hoped that official pressure &gt; would be exerted to ensure that the 'Civil and Military Gaxette' should make amends by publishing an editorial, or some other article, in terns more flattering to Iran. The article certainly gives a biassed account of modern Iran; it is written in poor taste and is of a kind that could not fail to arouse the ire of the Iranian authorities. I feel that it is unfortunate that such an article should have appeared in a paper of the standing of the «Civil and Military Gssette*. I realise that it may be difficult for the Government of India to take any action in such a matter, but I trust that it may be found possible to arrange that U&amp; paper should publish another article more favourable to Iran. The sensitiveness of the Iranian Government to criticism, particularly of the Shah, is such that a hostile article aay produce political consequences out of all proportion to its real importance. I consider /therefore- &amp; - therefore that it would be well worth while to tofce such atepw »e nay be posBible to assuage the feelings of the Iranian Oowernaent. I should be grateful if I might be informed in due course of any action which the Government of India may be able to take. 6. I understand that the w Civil and Military Gazette” is actually not published at Quetta, but at Lahore. I have mentioned this minor point in a letter which I have addressed to Monsieur 2andjani and a copy of which X have the honour to enclose. 6.

S PERSIA MINIATURE (By a Recent Visitor) To attempt anything like a complete, or even an adequate, pen-portrait of modern Iran in this limited space would he as futile as attempting to play the Choral Symphony on a penny whistle. Not, I hasten to assure you, that the slap-dash inconsequence of Iranian politics can possibly he compared with the melodious thunder and the grandeur that is Beethoven 1 s. There is precious little grandeur to he found in Iran - though it is an improvement on the Persia of a few years ago. To unravel the tangled skein of confusion that passes - faute de mieux - for law and order there, and to produce from the puzzled pattern of one f s observations anything that is tangibly coherent, is a task which leaves one searching uneasily for the much-vaunted subtlety of the Eastern mind. And even after the application of a wet towel round the head, one is still left wondering vaguely It is a country of complexities. Drawing from my own store of surface impressions, acquired after six months in the land, there are so many different facets to examine, so many points screaming fo^* criticism, and, above all, such a tremendous field of the bizarre and the fantastic for the telling, as would require a canvas as large as a Veronese, painted in with the sharp elongations of El Greco. It is such a collection of improbabilities and idiosyncracies that cannot all be captured and impressionistically recorded in a single cameo. The best I can put forward is something in the nature of a 'Persian Miniature,” though I cannot hope to rival the delicacy of touch and the detail of those compressed works of art. Method/Method of Travel, The method of my travel was particularly adapted for the acquisition of a relative knowledge of the country and an insight into the minds of the representative classes of the land - the under-dog and the man at the top. Riding rough-shod on the rims, with my entire 'belongings crammed into a small, but very portable, rucksack, I left Iraq behind me at Khaniquin and crossed the frontier into Iran at Khossrovi. Prom thence my route lay along the road taken by the camel caravans of old that traded between Baghdad and Teheran. Now, alas.* a Mechanical Age has laid Romance by the heels, and nothing more romantic than the post is borne along this road that stretches dustily back into the mists of antiquity: the prosaic lorry, f bus and occasional car are now the only forms of transport to be seen passing by day along its narrow, rutted track. But every vestige of the Past has not yet been obliterated from it entirely; l in the splendid silences of night one still hears the melodious Jangle of deep-sounding bronze bells of bull- camels, leaders of a string of forty or fifty beasts of burden, that ressurect from the ancient dust the ghosts of Haroun A1 Raschid, Hassan and Tamerlane.,.. Kaleidoscopic Impressions . My recollections of that Journey are kaleidoscopic and intensified into inconsequent impressions in a dis connected series of Incidents, Jostling each other with the haphazard intimacy of articles in a village Jumble- sa ^ e Baked skies of china-blue and long amphisboenas of dust trailing lazily along a countryside as flat as your/your* palm. Then segregated vistas of splendid untrlmmed trees among full-flooding grass. Two mountain ranges like isolated turreted walls stretching obliquely across the path; jagged peaks sharply etched from a design that Rackham might have produced for Hans Andersen. The shambles of old mud villages, long since deserted and now left crumbling into oblivion. Other mud villages still inhabited; and one in particular, which I arrived at in the evening - with storks nesting on the walls that lined the single street, a gurgling persistent brook in the background, and the sun setting in a flamboyant splash of colour behind the crenellated pattern of hills on the horizon. And after that, a long line of ill-lit unventilated caravanserais . filled with the acrid-sweet fumes of opium. I travelled in no organised way. Prom caravanserai to village, from village to town, on towards the capital, T chanced my means of locomotion. Here, an open Chevrolet truck, filled with Arabs, bound for Kermanshah; there, a lorry weighted down on its axle, heading for distant Tabriz; then an ancient ’bus, with primitive seats, plying for hire from one small town to another; finally to be delivered in Teheran with the mail on the post-van* Glancing back, recollection paints those days with softening tints. The discomfort has disappeared; only the interest remains. As an experience! it was invaluable. The people I lived and travelled with were all men of the soil, who loomed disproportionately large at the time but have now toned down to their correct perspective. I rubbed shoulders with what must have/4 . have heen the lowest and the dirtiest peasant in the land. Intensive Nationalism . On my arrival in Teheran, I reverted to normal once more, I stopped griibhing round the roots and glanced upwards at the top of the tree. Caparisoned in suitable raiment, I dined and wined (execrably) with a scented apparition who held, along with four or five others, the reins of Government. And I found what so many others before me have found - that the top is, after all, very like the bottom; it is merely a question of which way up you stand the tree. Scratch the Cabinet Minister and you find the peasant. They were both filled with the same nationalist extravaganza, they both told the same story, with the sole difference that the peasant really believed it. Everywhere and always the same story. One cannot escape this intensive wave of nationalism that is being systematically sproad throughout the new Iran; a nationalism that is being drummed into the gullible heads of a population that is eighty per cent illiterate: a nationalism that is driven in on the keen point of terror. The peasant will insist on it with the exaggerated seriousness of a child reciting something it has learnt by heart- the middle-class man will reiterate it with a faintly pathetic note of pleading in his voice, as ii he is trying to convince himself as well as you - the Cabinet Minister will repeat it with a smirk. But one and all, they are loud in their proclamation: they would like to be as fanatical about it as priests for their God. Nor is the explanation hard to rind. Fifty per cent of the population are reputed I to be spies in the pay of the Government, and if His Imperial/ 35. Imperial Majesty were to hear anything to the contrary, who knows - ? The Chahinchah (sic) is a small man with large ideas and a firm belief in the iron hand - without the velvet glove.* Ke is, for once, the right man in the right place: a man burned up with the raging fire of patriotism: a man with a profound, all-enveloping desire for the advancement of his nation: but a man, nevertheless, frustrated by his subordinates. His despotic rule is based on a sincere admiration for the Attaturk, and the evidences of his hopeless emulation of old ’’Grey Wolf” are abundant - even if pathetic. There is this nationalism gone mad. There is the parrot-cry of ’’Iranfbr the Iranians.” There is the same super-sensitiveness to criticism. There is the same scrabbling after Westernism. Teheran in Transition . Take Teheran for an example. There is a fugitive air of resentment about the old city; it wears a forlorn, nondescript look now in its slow period of transition from bast to West, as if it realises that it is in a bastard state, neither the one nor the other. Slowly the old landmarks that distinguished it are disappearing — the last of the twelve magnificent gateways that surrounded it have been pulled down; the splendours of the old Gulistan Palace are fast running to seed; buildings that held in their mosaic facades the beauties of ancient Persia are being demolished and in their place colourless, unimposing structures are being erected in a quasi- European style. Quantity, not quality, seems to be the new/6 (£) new slogan* Viewed from the eminence of the flanking hills, Teheran presents a flat straggling perspective of abode buildings, with only a flash of gold here and a gleam of blue there, as the sun is reflected f^om the dome of a is the Centre of Civilisation* 1 This is the town that the Iranian is taught to believe is ’’like Paris - only better ,,, . Those last four words epitomize the sublime foolishness of the new scheme of 'up-lift'. With the vast mineral resources of the country lying fallow for the most part, with a mad sj^stem of fantastic tariff duties crippling its trade and rapidly landing it in a state of general boycott, with mismanagement rending it from top to bottom, the wretched peasant and the credulous town- dwellers are taught to prattle idiotically about the beauty of mud-walls and the glory that is Teheran*sJ Perhaps this is the subtlety of the Eastern mind. If so, it is the only form of it I can pick on - the rest seems clear enough mosque, to relieve its drabness. There is none of the 'grim determination' of Ankara here - nor can there be: the Chah has set about it in the wrong way. And yet thisr (E 7501/809/34) r SQaET^N OFFICE, S.W.l. ‘ A 30th December* 1937 Immediate Dear Gibson, Will you please refer to Bowker’s letter to Clauson No. E 3379/966/65 of the -24th June last regarding the journey of a party of Indian Civil Service probationers across Persia to India? 2. I enclose a copy of a letter from Seymour to the Government of India, from which you will see that certain members of this party may be indulging in a little journalism. We have recently had considerable difficulties with the Persian Government over statements that have appeared in books and newspapers reflecting discredit (not always intentionally) upon the present regime in Persia. These difficulties culminated in the publication of a book, u By Order of the Shah 1 ' against which the Persian Government made strong protests. Consequently, we have to be exceptionally careful in these times about / ENC OSURE IN t i S’,i.S8 SECRETARY, PC SECRET DEPT. IN,any printed matter which may he published on the subject of Persia. 3 . 1 assume that Indian Civil Service probationers have to obtain the permission of the Government of India before publisuing articles about countries bordering on India. If it is not possible, under existing regulations to suppress altogether the articles referred to by Seymour, we shall be glad if they may be submitted to the Foreign Office or to the Legation at Tehran before permission for their publication is granted. Yours ever,Copy 29 cm (E 7501/809/34) No. 391/24/37 1st December, 1937. copies to Mr.Rendel (Ref. E.Dept's letter No. E 2545/966/65 of 18.5.37 and Teh.desp. No.422 of 6/11/37). Would you refer to my despatch No. 2Q6 __of the 6th November about the trouble caused by a book called 'By Order of the Shah'? 2. Recently two parties of Indian Civil Service probationers passed through Iran on their way to India. The names of the members of the second party v/ere Rogers, Adair Powler and either Acton or Scott. We have recently heard that two members of this party are doing a bit of journalism about their trip, one for the 'Times of India', the other for the London 'Times'. We did not know this when they went through Tehran, so we v/ere unable to give them a word of warning about Iranian susceptibility to criticism. It is obviously desirable that where we can prevent the publication of articles etcetera likely to cause trouble, we should do so. I should therefore be very grateful for anything you can do to ensure that there is nothing likely to offend in any articles published by these Probationers about their trip through Iran. 3. Butler will probably mention this question while he is in Delhi. But I thought it as well to send you a line too in case he does not raise it. 4. I am sending a copy of this letter to Rendel at the Foreign Office. (Signed) H.J.Seymour.

He felt sure that the publications to which Monsieur Safari had referred, were the result of personal spite. £, Monsieur Safari’s speech in the j ajlis was the signal for the publication of a series of articles in the Iranian press Five long articles were publisher in the 'Iran’* criticising the book n By order of the £&gt;hah u in detail* As might be expected,the criticism of the railway in that book provoked particularly angry corament. fhe general tone of the articles was childish. 3 # At the same tine the 'Jour; al de Teheran' published a long and equally childish article criticising one which hab appeared in the French periodical 'Les Annales' regarding the work of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company in Iran aid the benefits enjoyed by Iran thanks to the capital Investec in the country by the Company and its efficient activity. phe writer of the article in the journal de Teheran indignantly denied that Iran was in any way indebted to the oil Company,am said that if the original concession had not been granted by the weak Oovernraent of the day,Iran would soon have begun to exploit /herkar oil resources harsalf and would now be enjoying the full benefits thereof. This is obviously a dangerous argument to use so soon after the grant of another oil concession to another foreign company. The Tehran x^epreseutative of the i-.nglo•Iraniaa Oil Company in reporting the article^o Loiidon has said that it need not be taken seriously and that it does not represent the attitude of the Ministry of Finance,who appear at present to be very friendly to the Company. 4. The press campaign now appears to have died down, and during it the members of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, from the Acting /inister down,remained an xrieadly as usual. And I should add that some of the s#ii4$ments in the offending book which were most condemned by the press articles,have fou,.d some sympathetic response among the less timid public. The sensible,and public,remarks of Monsieur H&amp;ssan &lt;;sfandiary are a welcome novelty. But these considerations do not,I thiiik,diminish the reality of the warning given by the olitical Director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that if further books or articles of a character deemed provocative should appear,the Iranian Government will feel obliged to take some retaliatory action. As it is,tne outcry over this book will inevitably make it more difficult than ever for authors and especially for Journalists,to secure visas for Iran,or obtain any special facilities when they arrive here. 6.

MIDDLE EASTERN JOURNEY TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES Sir,—I regret to learn that the first of my three articles entitled “ Middle Eastern Journey ” has aroused the usual misapprehensions in Teheran. Exception is taken, I understand, to my sug gestion that an Anglo-Russian understanding in the Middle East might benefit Persia. Must I point out that the whole purpose of such an understanding, if contracted at the present moment, would be to prevent any repetition of that disastrous and indefensible attack on Persia’s independence which resulted from the Anglo- Russian Convention .of 1907? For Persia is still, in unofficial fact, a sphere of rival intrigues between the two Powers. An understanding such as my innocence conceived would provide opportunity for (1) A public renunciation of any desire on cither side to infringe Persia's political or economic integrity. (2) A private renunciation of the mutual suspicions now rampant on Persian territory—in other words; a genuine change of heart. The import of the idea lies in the latter clause. Mutual suspicions, if encouraged by circum stance, have a way of augmenting against the will of their possessors. It was this automatic process, which neither side could check, that produced the 1907 Convention. It appeared to me, therefore, when I wrote, that a new understanding calcu lated to eradicate such suspicions might act as a permanent safeguard to Persia’s interests. I may be wrong. But it cannot seriously matter to the Persian Government one way or the other, since neither the Foreign Office nor the Government of India are likely to notice the idea. It is possible that my generalizations concern ing the official Persian attitude to foreign opinion and foreign visitors were more sweeping than a five months’ sojourn warranted. When abroad I avoid politics if I can. But if politics obtrude on personal convenience y an impression forms of its own accord. I have given the impression that formed in my case. And I may now give another: which is, that if I were a Persian who knew my country’s history I should undoubtedly share this attitude towards the outer world. As an official policy it may or may not be wise. But it is certainly comprehensible. I am, Sir, your obedient servant, ROBERT BYRON. West Riding Express. BRITISH APPRENTICES’ CLUB TW.

Code telegram to Sir R. Koare (Tehran) 5 Foreign Office, 3rd October, 1934. 8.00 p.m No. 104. (R). My telegram No. 102 (of September 28th - ''Times’' article on Persia). Persian Minister called on October 1st with numerous telegrams from Tehran regarding Fir. Byron s article, explained that Shah’s reaction had been even worse that he feared, that he had been reprimanded for not taking 'effective action' earlier, and instructed to take matter up most stiongly with a view to getting something done to make it clear if possible that Fir. Byron’s remarks did not represent policy of His Majesty’s Government. Fact that offending passage was expression of opinion by private individual, not even representing views of news paper in which it appeared and in any case likely to paos unnoticed by vast majority of readers, was duly impressed on Ala, to whom inability of His Majesty’s Government to control press was again emphasised. It was eventually agreed, however, that as a very exceptional case an effort would be made to persuade the 'Times' to produce some article to counteract any false impression which Mr. Byron's article might have created as to true policy and views of His Majesty's Government. 'Times' has today, as a result oi urgent representations and largely owing to desire to make tilings easier iox nu« Persian Minister here, v/hose difficult position in this question is fully realised, published a second leader ostensibly2, ostensibly about Firdausi celebrations, containing passages quoted in my immediately following telegram. It has been explained to Persian Minister that insertion of leader on these lines has only be^ecured with utmost difficulty in view of exceptional circumstances attending present case, but that it is most unlikely that it will be possible to do anything of this kind again if, in spite of warnings from this department, 'Times' or any other newspaper should again publish misleading material about Persia. Should question of Mr. Byron's article be raised you may draw attention to 'Times' leading article and views expressed therein, but in doing so you should make it clear that His Majesty's Government are far from being in a position normally to exert such influence even on the 'Times , that insertion of the present article has only been secured with the utmost difficulty and as a most exceptional case, largely owing to the desire of the 'Times' to co-operate in facilitating the task of the new Persian Minister here. It is essential that appearance of present article in the 'Times' snouxa not be allowed to mislead Persian Government into thinking that His Majesty's Government have any real influence with the press, or are prepared to take action on every occasion when some misleading or offensive press article about Persia or any other foreign country appears*No&amp;y Re^feter^Co. ?201 IQ?'/; f SECRET.

THE GLORIES OF ISLAM STUDIES IN BRICK AND STONE By Robert Byron During 10 months I followed the evolution of Persian building from the third to the seven teenth centuries. A fundamentaL aesthetic guided that evolution. In India Mphamedan architecture became wholly two-dimensional, a series of decorated screens. In the Persian sphere there is the same avoidance of play with masses; but the expression of content, as opposed to mass, is nevertheless the prevailing idea. The need was to promote that idea with grace and economy. Hence the development of pattern and the refinement of dome, vault and squinch, from their clumsy Sassanian prototypes, through a period of muscular frankness, to the subtle curvatures of the Timurids and the floral mag nificence of Shah Abbas. This process gave rise to and was helped by a corresponding change in material. Persia is a stone country. Both the Achemenids and the Sassanids built largely in stone. But after the coming of Islam brick, stucco, and faience monopolized every building of importance. Stone is by nature massive, while brick suggests the limits of a void.

But after the coming of Islam brick, stucco, and faience monopolized every building of importance. Stone is by nature massive, while brick suggests the limits of a void. The study of monuments in these countries is not easy. To be English is a prime disadvantage •—though it was partly offset in my case by recommendations in Persia from Mr. Upham Pope, Director of the American Institute for Persian Art and Archaeology. These enabled me to obtain the licence without which photo graphy in Persia is forbidden lest the malignant traveller should defame his hosts by advertising some picturesque but retrograde custom or type. They were not, alas! sufficient to overcome the frenetic jealousies of certain resident foreign archaeologists. Afghanistan I found more free, except in the north. At Balkh a gentleman in formed me that while photography was allowed sketching was not, and he must confiscate my attempt to portray the shrine of Khwaja Abul Nasr Parsa. When we left Mazar-i-Sharif our guards told us they had been instructed to pre vent our use of a camera altogether. A nice dis play of indignation, amounting in the last case to a simulation of apoplexy, overcame these obstructions. In every town the presentation of credentials &lt;s/ involved a round of calls and formalities. The society thus gained would ordinarily have been a pleasure; it was I who bored governors, mayors, and chiefs of police, not they me. But with a hired car waiting, the sun moving to a wrong quarter, or rain-clouds threatening not only the prevention of photography. but the destruction of the road, the hours abandoned to ceremony were necessarily spared with reluct ance. At the same time I retain most grateful memories of my numerous escorts, who carried my apparatus, guarded me from fanatics, un earthed the keepers of keys, and suffered patiently cold, hunger, and exhaustion while I continued day by day, from dawn to dusk, with my inexplicable researches. The worth of all this effort on the part of a solitary amateur lay mainly in his private educa tion. But there exist in both countries so many unrecorded or unstudied monuments of the first importance that any observations concerning them will be useful, if only to arouse the interest of others. I may instance, first, a Sassanian palace near Firuzabad in the Persian province of Ears. Buildings of this epoch are rare, and, though devoid of artistic virtue, represent a crucial phase in the development of architecture. This particular one, not to be confused with the three-domed palace of Ardeshir near by, over hangs the great gorge of Firuzabad. Its upper part comprises what was once a barrel-vaulted hall 45ft. broad, and a perfect square-domed chamber about 40ft. high. The whole is con tained within a gigantic ellipse of masonry, between which and the chamber lies a large area to which access was once possible through an arch leading out of the latter. This arch has been neatly walled up. Attempts have been made to tunnel through on either side of it, but have been resisted by 20ft. of solid stonework. And there are other evidences of the early Sassanids in the gorge: two rock-carvings, and the pier of a bridge in the river with an inscription recording its erection in the third century. But more romantic still was a natural Turkish bath on top of the cliff, a Stygian cavern full of vapour and quaking mud, approached by a level tunnel 40ft. long. Remains of Sassanian masonry showed that this had once been regularly used, thus explaining possibly the choice of site for the palace. The Sassanid kings are known to us chiefly by the soulless vulgarity of their rock- hewn triumphs. Here, for once, it was possible to conceive them as human beings. FOUR MARVELS Of Islamic monuments which have re ceived little or no previous notice, Yezd revealed the greatest number. The tall portal and mosaic faience of the Masjid-i-Jami, dating from the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, are among the finest things of their kind in Persia. In addition, there emerged a series of highly individual buildings, whose in teriors are painted with Kufic script of un paralleled intricacy. I lighted alsp upon one of the old city gates, a wooden door covered with bronze plates that bear primitive Signs of the Zodiac. Kerman and Shiraz likewise disclosed unexpected treasures. At Kazvin, in the dome- chamber of the Masjid-i-Jami, I was able to photograph a unique Seljuk decoration of applied stucco, whose delicacy and restraint fore shadow the poetry without the sentiment of the Safavid epoch. Persian architecture achieved four supreme masterpieces: the tower of Gum- bad-i-Qabus (a.d. 1007); the Mausoleum at Sul- taniya (1310); the mosque of Gohar Shad at Meshed (1418); and the mosque of Sheikh Lut- fullah at Isfahan (c. 1600). Of these the second and fourth are well known. My last journey in Persia enabled me to see the other two. Gumbad-i-Qabus lies about 40 miles east of Asterabad, not far from the Russian frontier.

Already thrice baulked of a Russian visa, and once of a Chinese, I reached Herat last November to learn that motors had travelled from there to Afghan Turkestan for the first time that year. I took a seat in a lorry. On the Paropamisus we ran into snow. For two miles 11 of us dug the road to the top of the Sauzak Pass, whence the lorry began to slither down a precipitous mule-track of hairpin bends, freezing slush, and clay as slippery as vaseline. After a night in the open we came to Kala Nao, where we decided to stop a day and rest. There it began to rain. The rain turned to snow. 1 Four days I lay on a mud floor, hugging my hot- water bottle and reading Boswell. Then dysen- ; tery set in, and realizing that henceforth I ! should have to travel mainly by horse, for which I had not enough money, I made up my mind ’ to go back. Only by twisting my then three words of Persian into a threat to die on his hands, could I extort horses from the Governor. These took me 105 miles back to Herat in two and a half days. From there I returned to Meshed in Persia, where I spent Christmas and recuperated for a fortnight in the hospitable precincts of the Consulate.

Spring found me once more at Meshed, this time with my friend Sykes, who had a car. All the rain that England lacked was arriving with a west wind. Beyond Kariz, the Persian frontier, the road was impossible. Impervious to the protests of a Persian officer, who foretold danger, we rode out into no-man’s land to examine it and came on a dead man who had been shot through the chest and forehead. Not a molehill dis turbed the level plain for 10 miles in any direc tion. “ Do you,” said the officer, in a last effort to save his country’s reputation, “ do you think he could have been run over ? ” We replied that the Perso-Afghan frontier was a safer place than an English main road. But he got no comfort from that. Herat was gayer than in winter. The blue minarets rose from fields of white opium poppies ; the whole air was heavy with the scent of Shepherdia, a tree like an osier that grows along streams. This time the ascent of the Paropamisus was easy. But on the northern slope the road was wet, and the car skidded on to a boulder from which it could not be moved. At nightfall a shepherd came by and lent us his gun for fear of wolves. The wolves kept off, but not the rain. Next morning a gang of road- makers got the car down. We walked behind, with eyes averted. Twenty miles beyond Kala Nao, in a lonely grass country, the car stopped again. We were wondering what to do, when round a corner of the downs rode a pistachio merchant followed by two armed attendants. Seeing the car, he offered to buy it. We mounted the horses of the attendants, who rode pillion behind us; the veiled gentleman who now clasped my waist was said by his party to have killed, five men—-a little young for that sort of thing, didn’t I think ? He giggled coyly. The next day the merchant collected £50 from the neighbouring villages.' This being all in silver coins the size of a shilling and worth threepence each, a whole kit-bag had now to be devoted to our funds. We proceeded by horse to Murghab, crossing the Band-i-Turkestan where pistachios were growing in profusion, and joining the Murghab river at a gorge whose twin castles are said, like everything else, to have been built by Alexander. At Murghab, in the Governor’s garden, stood a car, one of those vehicles which used to fall to bits in comic films when the mother-in-law stepped in. This, its driver assured us, would certainly take us to Maimena. It did—after the radiator had fallen off twice, after it had run backwards into a river at 30 miles an hour, and after it had jumped into a hole 3ft. deep and out again. On the way we stopped a night at a serai kept for charity by a holy man, who fed us with milk and honey, brought half the village to be doctored, and sent us on our way with armfuls of crimson roses out of his garden. At Maimena the life was an idyll, a pageant of flowered stuffs and lightning-patterned silks, centring round a grass maidan, an English meadow it might have been, where the popula tion assembled every evening to watch wrestling bouts and partridge fighting, to chat and sing songs in the tea-houses by the road, or to listen to the brass band. When at last we left it was in a lorry, painted with flowers and urban landscapes, which we hired for our own use. This took us north to Andkhui, and thence east, through Shibarghan and Akcha, stopping now and then to let us visit Turcoman encampments and converse with Uzbek shepherds about their famous lambs, whose skins, when fine, fetch £2 10 s. apiece even here. BY RUINED BALKH A succession of Buddhist mounds, weary with age and weather, broke the monotony of the plain as we anproached the vast walled acreage of ruins which is Balkh. The decay of the Mother of Cities is now ascribed by popular fancy, not to Jenghis Khan, but to the invasion of those wicked Bolshevists eight years since. Greek coins, we learnt from a more reliable source, were in ordinary circulation until about the same time. That night we reached Mazar-i- Sharif, having come 480 miles from Herat. The enterprise of Mohammad Gul Khan, pro vincial Minister of the Interior, has endowed the capital of Afghan Turkestan with an hotel in which tables, chairs, cutlery, spring beds, and prettily tiled wash-rooms await the infrequent visitor. We enjoyed these amenities. Even soda- water was available, and here, as in other towns, pails of snow were brought to cool our evening whisky. We were now only 40 miles from the Oxus. But owing apparently to fear of Russian displeasure the authorities forbade us to visit the river. This was a dis appointment, and we decided to see what the Russians themselves had to say about it. The Consul was away; but the Vice-Consul offered to do what he could by telegraphing to Moscow for visas to Samarkand. Meanwhile, what about a party ? Such an opportunity as our advent was not to be missed. All the Russians of the place had assembled that evening to welcome us, including a tele graphist who had worked at Canterbury duringPERSIA AND TURKEY. 7. Lieut. - Colonel Sir ARNOLD WILSON asked the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs whether he will make a statement as to the forthcoming arrange ments for the impending meeting of the rulers of Persia and Turkey? Sir J. SIMON: Reports have reached His Majesty’s Government that His Imperial Majesty the Shah of Persia may pay an official visit to the President of the Turkish Republic in the course of the summer. The matter is one which falls entirely within the sphere of the two foreign countries concerned and does not concern His Majesty’s Government in any way. Sir A. WILSON: Can my right hon. Friend say anything which will tend to discourage the publication in this country of statements of a misleading and derogatory character regarding the rulers of these two countries? Sir J. SIMON: I deplore no less than my hon. and gallant Friend the appear ance of such references to the heads of foreign States with whom His Majesty’s Government are on terms of cordial friendship and under whose able leader ship those countries have made remark able progress ; but, as he is aware, His Majesty’s Government are not in a posi tion to take any action in such cases, and public opinion will no doubt know what value to attach to such references as those to which my hon. and gallant Friend refers.i t\ DEAi^P In any further communication on this subject, please quote no.

When he protested that heads of states at least should be exempt from such scurrilous comment, he was told of scurrilous allusions frequently appearing in United States press to crowned heads of Europe. Such things were beneath contempt, and Anglo-Persian relations could never be placed on satisfactory basis so long as contemptible press notices - which would never be stopped — we re treated seriouslya Charge d'Affaires fears reaction on Shah of article v/hich he has presumably telegraphed to Tehran. You may decide to fore stall further protests in Tehran, and try to bring Persian Government and Shah to look at the matter in reasonable light.

Sir 5 Tehran, December 16, 1933. ’ SINCE I wrote my despatch No. J§2_of the 2nd December on the subject of the crisis created by the Shah's resentment of some foolish utterances in the Evening Standard, the atmosphere here has not been improved by the uneasiness resulting from discovery of the Bakhtiari ’‘plot,' on which I am reporting separately. 2. Until the Shah returned to Tehran from Mazanderan it was, I gathered from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, impossible for his Excellency to communi cate with His Majesty owing to the bad weather and the rapidity and uncertainty of his movements. Meanwhile, the day was approaching when the news of the Times article of the 28th November. “ The Trend of Events in Persia, would add fuel to the flames. I spent a considerable amount of time during this interval in endeavouring to induce the Minister for Foreign Affairs to stand up to his master and insist on his listening to reason, and with this object in view I wrote him the enclosed letter.(') 3. The Shah returned to Tehran on the 8th December and presided at the Council of Ministers two days later, but, according to the Minister for loreign Affairs, only current business was discussed. However, shortly afterwards the Shah did allow Kazemi to talk to him at length. I understand that on the first occasion he merely listened while Kazemi recited to him “ all that was suitable in our conversations, but that at a later audience he expressed himself as more or less satisfied with the explanations given him and accepted Kazemi’s suggestion that he should send for me with a view to finally closing the press incident. 4. Thereupon Kazemi sent me a message on the 13th December saying that His Majesty would be glad to see me on the 18th December and that meanwhile he, the Minister, would now be glad if I would send him in writing the message authorised in your telegram No. 223 o f the 29th November. This I did in a letter, of which I enclose a copy. 5. But this letter did not at all meet the needs of the case, and it transpired from a conversation with Shayesteh. who came ostensibly to answer a question on a point of procedure connected with the impending audience, that what was wanted was the inclusion of the oral part of the message indicating that His Majesty’s Government had taken more vigorous action than a deliberate examination of the circumstances bearing on the mudir’s trespass warranted, and that they had no intention to inflict a humiliation on the Persian Government. 6. I explained that your message wms divided into two distinct parts, one for written transmission, if I thought fit, and the other for oral communication, and I explained that to my mind it was obviously inconvenient to tell people in writing that it had not been intended to humiliate them, whereas it was perfectly reasonable and natural to say that one rather thought they had suspected such an intention and would they please believe that they were quite mistaken. 7. When I saw Kazemi to-day, he held the same language as his subordinate, and his demeanour suggested that the Shah, having kicked the press incident, was now in a mood to turn on Basidu. At one moment his Excellency expressed the hope that the press incident was on the way to being settled, and at another he said that the audience would constitute evidence that it was. His nervousness was very evident and he almost begged me to keep off politics with the Shah and to treat the audience simply as a courtesy on my return from several months abroad. 8. Kazemi pressed for something akin to an apology for the mudir incident, arguing, as before, that the Persian Government had expressed regrets for the flag incident and why could we not do the same. When I told him that in both (*) Not printed. [15 b—7]cases the aggression came from the Persian side, he admitted that the cases were not fully parallel, but maintained that they were similar, and when I said that it would be supremely easy for him to make a statement in the Majlis which would make everybody happy, he said he could not do so unless he received a satisfactory communication in writing from me. And so I told him a variety of things abo ut ^ the cancellation of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company Concession, the flag inciden^d^. the arrest and detention at Mohammerah of Captain Macleod, and, finally, the unprecedented nature of the instructions which he had sent to the Persian Charge d'Affaires in London about the press campaign. He was rather dogged and sullen, an attitude strikingly different to his whole demeanour with regard to the press. In the latter case he, almost verbally, begged me to help him to persuade the Shah not to push anger to the limits of folly. In the mudir incident he appeared to believe that the Shah could and would obtain satisfaction if he insisted. If satisfaction were withheld by His Majesty’s Government the Persian Government were determined to secure it by international action. 9. You will have realised that in all these conversations I have been talking to a trinity in which the “persons” are frequently “confounded.' We have . (1) the terrified servant of the King of Kings clutching at the straw of my desire ’ to help him to pacify his master ; (2) the Balkan politician's outlook on prestige; (3) the ordinary intelligent man’s grasp of the elementary fact that it is not wise to force a quarrel on the British Empire. 10. In the press business, factor (1) has been uppermost throughout with factor (3) constantly present in his mind. 11. In the mudir business, viewed in isolation and divorced from other matters which to the objective mind constitute a formidably deterrent context, prestige naturally springs into the foreground and factors (1) and (3) more or less cancel out, although (1) must always remain predominant. “In that affair of the mudir,” Kazemi has, I think, been saying to himself, “ the British slipped up, and as they have a nice ethical sense they must know it. If I can extract an admission from them for publication that they have been peccant, I shall for a long time to come bask in the sunshine of the Imperial favour. If I fail I can strictly carry out the Imperial order to arraign His Majesty’s Government before a world tribunal for the rape of the mudir. In any case I am unwilling to face, for the second time in a fortnight, the hazardous task of urging master to control his temper.” 12. And so Kazemi tells me fairly stiffly that unless I can obtain your authority to write him something which will satisfy Persian amour-propre and make it possible for them to close the incident, it must be referred for settlement to a third party, who will, doubtless, wish, in the course of the investigation, to learn precisely what the de jure position is at British Basidu. 13. I should have liked to retort that this third party might have been led to interest itself in a variety of other matters, such as the fact that for four years the de jure position of Basidu has been reserved for settlement in a general treaty which, as proved by the King’s message to the Shah, His Majesty’s Government are anxious to conclude; the conciliatory attitude of His Majesty’s Government in the Anglo-Persian Oil Company issue; the readiness with which they accepted explanations regarding the flag incident at that same Basidu which might well have been rejected with derision, and, above all, the forbearance of His Majesty’s Government in the face of an astoundingly offensive threat to break off relations; of equal interest would be the aggressiveness of the Persian flotilla in the Gulf and the Shatt-el-Arab, of which abundant and alarming evidence was available. While I did not know how the matter would be handled if submitted to a third party, I greatly doubted whether the result would really enhance Persian interests. 14. However, I considered myself debarred by the language of your telegram No. 247 of yesterday's date from any such display of truculence, and in the end I tolcTthe Minister that I would report his views to you, and made the suggestion, which he accepted, that we should leave Basidu alone for a week or so. 15. At the end of the conversation I reverted to the Shah’s susceptibility with regard to the press, and said that editors, working up to half-minute margins could not keep, as the Shah appeared to expect, a special pair of spectacles with which to scrutinise every mention of Persia, I really could not bear the idea of a similar uproar a few weeks hence. Kazemi assured me very positively that he would do all in his power to induce a sense of proportion in these matters.16. As this rambling record of facts and impressions will not reach London for some ten days any interest which may attach to this despatch is merely academic, but it may possibly be of some help in future crises of a similar nature to record my present mood and to do so to-day rather than after seeing the Shah on Tuesday. . , tip to the time that I went on leave in June after eighteen montns se^Wce here, there did not seem to be any insuperable difficulty, however slow the process might be. in eventually placing the relations with the Persian Government on a satisfactory footing. The treaty negotiations made little progress, but on the whole the general attitude of the Persian official world afforded evidence ot a desire in high quarters to live at peace with us. Things continued to improve until, over the flag incident. Mr. Mallet was suddenly confronted by weeping Prime Ministers and acting Ministers for Foreign Affairs who, according to the Shah, had been tricked by him and fully expected to pay the penalty oi their gullibility. He more than saved the situation, and then came the mudir incident. Again there was an explosion of wrath which was conveyed to the Legation m a number of unseemly notes both bearing on, and irrelevant to, the actual issue. JNothing more dramatic occurred probably. I think, because the Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs managed to represent to the Shah that His Maiestv’s Minister was on the point of returning to his post and that it would be seemly not to embark on a crisis until he had got here. It appears certain that they paid in hard words for this display of moderation, as I had hardly had time to tell the Minister for Foreign Affairs that I hoped shortly to be able to discuss Basidu with him, when news reached the Shah and his Cabinet at the Turcoman races that the Evening Standard had libelled the King of Kings. And there and then a grotesque instruction was despatched to the Persian Charge d Affaires m London threatening to break off relations. It appears that as the result ot the persuasiveness of the Minister for foreign Affairs or of the fact that the Sha s attention or concentrated vindictiveness was diverted to the Bakhtiari plotter^ the threat of a rupture is being allowed to die a natural death. But, the Bakhtiaris having been struck down, vindictiveness over Basidu is re\mng and we are threatened with a reference to the League of Nations if we do not afford satisfaction—and all this in spite of the fact that we are waiting patiently to resume the negotiations for a general treaty which the ^hah certainly wants, it - only because he hates the Russians and does not believe he can afford to hate both his oreat neighbours. Thus, we have had, in the space of three months, hhf e ® explosions of rage, two of them without the slightest justification, each ot which has been on the verge of rendering the maintenance of good relations impossible. I am beginning to wonder whether the Shah, finding that fury has served his purpose well in internal affairs, is not gradually coming to think that it may not be equally well used in foreign relations : in fact, whether there is not some justification for the suspicion which I have recently expressed that his rage is a bluff. If this is so the task of calling it will one day have to be faced, and it will be a matter of some delicacy. ^ ^ . 18. I am sending copies of this despatch, with its enclosures, to the Toreign Secretarv to the Government of India, the Hon. Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (No 248), and to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad (No. 110). v I have, &amp;c. R. H. HOARE. Enclosure in No. 1. Sir R.

My dear Minister, , 1933. “ YOUR Excellency has asked me to write you a letter confirming the message which I delivered to you orally on the subject of Basidu some days ago. The following is the message which I delivered on that occasion : “ His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom have considered in consultation with me the best means of ending the recriminations which have followed upon the recent unfortunate incidents at Basidu. They feel that the surest way to put an end to all incidents in the Persian Gulf will be theconclusion of a general treaty. They wish once more to make it clear that the question of Basidu will be one of the matters to be dealt with in the treaty and that if a satisfactory settlement is reached on all other points they will be prepared to surrender their rights in Basidu. In the meantime, relyin^ on the assurances contained in the Imperial Government’s note of the 12th September (21st Shahrivar) they have decided to withdraw the a^ d o-uard now at Basidu. The flying of the British flag on the flagstaff wih, oi course, continue in the meantime, in accordance with the status quo. As I subsequently informed your Excellency orally, the guard has since been Your Excellency will readily understand that I can do nothing further in these matters while the situation arising out of the representations recently made by the Persian Charge d'Affaires in London remains under discussion. 1 R.

I HAVE the honour to report that the Ittiladt of the 13th December contains a translation of an article on Persia in the Daily Telegraph of the 28th November by Mr. Merton^ 1 2 3 4 ) the Cairo correspondent, who made a journey to Persia last spring, in the course of which he was received by the Shah. 2. The translation is published in the most prominent place available on the front page, with the title in large letters : &lt;£ Reza Shah Pahlavi, the greatest and wisest personality in Persia.” 3. At the end of the translation, the Ittiladt adds the following note :— “ In two or three sentences, especially in the last portion of the above- quoted article, the honourable author has not quite adhered to the truth; it is unnecessary for us to point out to our respected readers that the Persian nation and Government make no distinction between any foreign Powers in their policy of friendly relations.” The reference is doubtless to that part of the article which deals with the evil designs and intentions of Russia, and which says that there are special oppor tunities for friendship between Great Britain and Persia. It is, of course, quite true that the less emphasis is laid in the press on the necessity for Persia of British friendship, the more readily that friendship is likely to be accepted. 4.

Sir, 13th, 'Order in Persia', has been ill-received by our local journalists and the following summary of an article in the Shafaq-i-Surkh is typical s- How astonishing it is that a paper should persist in the publication of falsified news.* Krroneous guesses arise from two causes* either the author 1 b of intelligence, or else he is a careful and diligent man who, for motives of his own, purposely distorts his news in order to lead hishearers astray. tfe must place the ’Times’ writer in the latter category, and not for the first time. His observations reveal hie prejudice and his evil intentions. The ’Times' has lately changed its tune with regard to Persia, sometimes praising, and sometimes criticising, fe take no pride in the praise and we cannot allow the justice of the blame. The writer ventures, without knowing anything about the matter, to say that the arrest of the Bakhtiari chiefs marks a stage in the struggle between the Persian crown and Persian feudalism. Fortunately, such statements, the source of which is not stated, create no impression on their readers, but we must inform our readers that the object of the ’Times' writer was evidently to create the impression that in Persia of to-day feudalism exists. This ridiculous idea needs no refutation; its author /must The Right Honourable Sir John Simon, G.C.S.I., etc., etc., etc. The Foreign Office*must either he rery ignorant of history or he desirous, for eotives of his own, of spreading such absurdities outside Persia* Persia has enjoyed a centralised regime since the beginning of history, and has nerer suffered from the feudalism which used to reign in England. It is obvious that, in every country, whenever the Government is weak the upper classes will oppress the inhabitants, until the Government becomes strong and puts everyone in his place again* previous to this regime it is true that the chiefs of the Bakhtiari tribes had a certain authority over their own men and imposed their will upon those weaker than themselves; but nowadays two things have rendered all the tribes of Persia faithful to His Majesty keza Shah; first, the authority and the greatness of the Imperial Government, and second, the fact that the tribes appreciate that His Majesty is, in person, the best possible paternal protector and the greatest saviour of the people* Hence, how can feudalism exist? In another place, the 'Times 1 states that the strong measures taken against rebellious persons have created enemies both in Persia and abroad* It is strange that the 'Times' should know all about these 'enemies', while we ourselves know nothing about them* Is the 'Times' to lecture us about our own country? The 'Times’ is clearly seeking to gain some nefarious advantage, just as our enemies used to do in the bad old days; but fortunately that is all ancient history now* «ho are the internal enemies/ The criminal of course fears justice; the transgressor knows he will be punished; but such persons exist in all countries* If there are enemies of the present regime in Persia their /onlyOur beloved Shah only choice is to go avay and die* devotes his attention to the State, not to individuals; should there he any persons who remained opposed to this policy, the truth is that they have all been exterminated long ago. The ’Times' writer himself recognises that H changes in the military art diminished the value of their eontingents^ but has the t Times , never heard of the national conscription which is now in force? 2. It would obviously be a wild and wilful waste of time to submit this effusion to a crtloal &amp;npl£sls and to show in detail how grossly it has perverted the sanely laudatory appreciation by the 'Times’ of what the Shah has accomplished during his short reign. 3. How, the present Minister for Foreign Affairs does not make the slightest attempt to deny that the Press of Tehran writes what it is told to write or at any rate what it is quite doubly sure will be approved. 4. Let us assume for the moment that there has not been a blunder and that the press has been told to let loose its ineptitudes. Having a certain fondness (due, I hope, only to environment) for the absurd, I should like to believe that the present outburst is a sort of retort to our successful insistence on the fact that our press is not and osnnot be muzzled, but this idea is rather too far fetched and 1 favour the simple explanation that there has been a blunder or time-lag - that some one has failed to notify the press that the Evening Standard, Mr. de Bathe's article in 'the Times' and the Mudir of Basldu have all been consigned to the limbo of things forgiven and forgotten and that there is not a shadow of doubt that the British Empire is a pillar of the Persian state.- 4 - B. I hop® I am right. In support of ay view there are a nuiaher of solid facta:-* the Shah received a full summary of the — now peccant • leading article several days before the Times of December 13th arrived here and was pleased with it; on about the day that it did arrive, General Eyrom, the intelligent and influential Chief of Police, told Mr. Trott that the article would go far to remove painfil impressions, and, finally, the Shah’s manner at ay audience, which took place after he had been acquainted with the contents of the article, and the confident cordiality of the Minister for Foreign Affaire only two days ago seem to show that there is no cloud on the horizon, 6, If the Minister for Foreign Affairs should happen to mention the matter to me I shall say all the ungracious things that seem obviously suitable, 7, I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India (No, 266), and to the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (No. 264).

I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith copy of the letter to the Minister for Foreign Affairs mentioned in my telegram N o. 347 o f the 30th November. 2. For purposes of record it may be convenient to recapitulate the facts which have led up to it, to expound the ideas which I have had in mind since the storm broke and to endeavour to present a clear picture of a mad woi Id. 3. When I received the Minister for Foreign Affairs’ message that he wished to see me on grave and urgent matters, I naturally concluded that it was to convey to me a sense of his master s impatience at the entirely negative attitude which I had been obliged to adopt at my previous conversation on the subject of Basidu and political relations generally, and I rather anticipated that there would be a definite threat to refer the issue to arbitration. I was therefore positively elated to receive, as I was on the point of leaving the Legation, your telegram No. 223 of the 29th November, and my intention was to cut the Minister short as sooirasTie mentioned Basidu, saying that he probably had unpleasant things to say, or at least expressions of impatience to utter. As everything was now settled, he had better listen to me, when he would no doubt conclude that he need not deliver his message. 4. However, it soon became clear that a mere political issue was not involved, but that the “Londoner’s Diary’’ of the Evening Standard had reproduced a story that the Shah’s grip was being relaxed under the influence of opium, and that a Kajar restoration might be expected (the phrase “ legitimate dynasty ’’ was evidently especially galling). The Shah was terribly upset, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs declared that he himself was in despair. I replied that my recollection was not very definite on the subject, but I knew that Mr. Mallet'had received a communication from you, and I thought the incident had been immediately closed by the publication of a categorical denial of the story by the Evening Standard at the instance of the Foreign Office. As the Minister maintained that the denial was at best a most half-hearted one, and was not able to produce the text, I telephoned to the Legation, and Mr. Mallet read me your telegram No. 211 of the 9th November, 1933. I then said that the denial seemed entirely explicit, but the Minister maintained that it was not and had not helped matters in the least, and he had been obliged to instruct the Persian Charge d’Affaires in London to make representations to you of a serious nature. He doubted whether Nouri Esfandiari could accomplish very much, and he appealed with the greatest earnestness for my help. 5. I did not immediately ask the nature of the representations to be made to you, and the Minister, while definitely disclaiming any desire to suggest the means by which His Majesty’s Government should heal the Shah’s wounded pride, enquired whether we had not a law of lese-majeste, and explained that, under Persian law, a press attack on the person of a foreign Sovereign was on the same footing as an attack on the Shah himself. I said that no doubt we had some machinery, that I had no idea when it was last put into operation, that I imagined that it was only used at the instance of the representative of the injured party, and that I thought that to attempt to use it would probably do more harm than good, explaining that it would not be possible to prevent papers publishing full accounts of the trial, which would have great news value, and that journalists are a close and clannish corporation. 6. The Minister again disclaimed all desire to make suggestions, and said that the Shah had got it into his head, partly as the result of the mudir incident at Basidu, and still more so because of the Evening Standard's rumours, that we [999 s—1]wished to humiliate him. I replied that it was of peculiar interest that he should use the word “humiliate,’’ because, after our previous conversation, I had reported to you my impression that the Persian Government regarded the manner in which the mudir had been treated as proof of a desire to humiliate. In the telegram (No. 223) which I had just received, and which I was convinced would remove all our difficulties, I had been instructed (reading from a slip of paper) “that His Majesty’s Government wished to assure the Persian Governme'^*' expressly that it is alien to their policy and traditions, and was absent from their intentions, to humiliate a friendly nation.' 7. I then gave him orally the sense of the instructions contained in that telegram, and said that I felt sure that they provided a solution of our difficulties. His reply indicated that perhaps they would have, but not now; certainly not until the Shah had received “ satisfaction ’’ over the Evening Standard. 8. His demeanour and language had become steadily more confidential, sadder, and, if possible, more friendly, and at this stage I realised that the explosion of Royal wrath had been no ordinary one, so I asked Kazemi to tell me the precise nature of the instructions sent to the Persian Charge d’Affaires. He made it plain that they contained a threat to break off relations. I expressed my amazement that the Shah, whose mind was quite clear on the importance of good relations, should take a course of action which seemed likely to ruin them. 9. Kazemi assured me that he himself knew with absolute certitude that His Majesty’s Government desired to see a stable, orderly and independent Persia; a quarrel would be utterly opposed to Persian interests, but, “ when people were enraged, and anything that touched his honour or seemed likely to diminish his prestige enraged the Shah, they frequently did not stop to think ”; he repeated that I must find a solution. I replied, speaking with some solemnity, that the danger of the present situation lay in the fact that people in London must inevitably begin to wonder whether it was really worth while to continue the thankless task of trying to reach an agreement with a man who, under the influence of anger, violently changed his mind and proceeded to give effect to it. Kazemi did not demur. And we finally parted, after I had told him that I thought I had better see the Prime Minister. 10. Feroughi, to whom I then telephoned, characteristically suggested that he would prefer to see me the next day, but agreed to receive me at five o’clock when I said that the matter was obviously urgent. 11. His Highness was looking quite deplorably dejected. He was less friendly than Kazemi, and tried to maintain that the Shah’s belief in the existence of a group of wreckers of our relations, and suspicion that they had the ear of His Majesty’s Government, was justified by this and previous press attacks. I replied that, assuming these wreckers to exist, the Shah was obviously playing straight into their hands; as for their having the ear of His Majesty’s Government, the telegram I had just received was a more than sufficient reply. I gave him the sense of it, and he proceeded ungraciously enough to suggest (fear may apparently affect the manners of the mildest of men) that it did not amount to much, as we appeared to be attaching conditions to the admission of Persia’s undoubted rights. So I said rather angrily that he was just as capable as I was of reciting the text of the Basidu article in the draft treaty, and I flatly refused to believe that he would not have received my news with joy but for the publication of a wretched piece of malicious gossip. This did not deter him from repeating that it was impossible to believe, in the light of recent events, that His Majesty’s Government were well disposed, and I replied, again angrily, that the disposition of His Majesty’s Government was contained in the telegram in my hands; I could not understand his attitude, and this elicited a definite statement that he could express no opinion, the matter being too high for him, and he did not know at all what “one” (his irritating alias for the Shah) would think of it. 12. I then told the Prime Minister that on reflection I found I was not at all clear in my mind regarding the nature of the instructions sent to the Persian Charge d’Affaires. Unless I knew precisely, it was useless for me to submit any views to you. I should therefore be grateful if he would ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs (whom he was about see at the Council of Ministers) to let me have a copy. Feroughi was most doubtful, and gave me a version which I said left me as much in doubt as ever, and then he promised to talk to Kazemi.13. On my return to the Legation I found your telegram No. _ 22± summarising a positively appalling article which had appeared in the Times of the day before. 14. It was quite obvious that if the Shah was desperately upset over the Evening Standard, there was no possibility of gauging the nature of his rage on receipt of this second attack. 15. The situation was an unusual one in that you were not yet aware how infuriated the Shah already was, whilst I was far from sure exactly what sort of representation was about to be made to you, and was therefore in no position to judge how it would be received by His Majesty’s Government. At the same time I had no shadow of doubt that nothing I could do here would even begin to pacify the Shah when he learnt of the Times article, unless it were strongly reinforced by action in London. I therefore sent you a number of tentative suggestions based on the hope that any action taken by an oriental Government, even over shadowed by a great fear of a furious master, is seldom quite final, and that the threat to break off relations was perhaps not so outrageous as to render conciliatory action by His Majesty’s Government impossible. 10. In making my suggestions it was some moral comfort to share in a considerable measure the impending anger of the Shah against the Times and the author of the article, Mr. Christopher de Bathe, who has served as honorary attache at Stamboul and Brussels and has no excuse for not observing the ordinary decencies and knew full well that I regarded any reference to the jockey incident as entirely out of the question. As a matter of fact, he greatly disliked his time in Tehran, where his violent temper played a part on one or two occasions in bringing him into collisions of a minor nature with authority. Having left the country for good, the young gentleman has felt that he could safely vent his spite. 17. I note that I have omitted to state earlier in this despatch that I suggested both to Feroughi and to Kazemi that the obvious way to straighten matters out was for the Shah to send for me; they both made it plain that they did not dare make any such proposal to him. This is regrettable, because it is practically certain that if he saw me he would not only behave properly, but immediately' realise that these dark suspicions of his about the intentions of His Majesty’s Government are all rubbish. 18. Feeling myself debarred from definitely asking for an audience because it would quite possibly be refused, I have drafted the letter to the Minister for Foreign Affairs which forms my enclosure. In the absence of instructions to the contrary, I shall send it to him this morning with a message that I wish to see him as soon as he has studied it. 19. As I have observed by telegram, I believe this letter to be sufficiently courteous to be fit for the Shah’s eyes and to be free of an humility, which would be unseemly. I have placed at the beginning of the letter a reference to the natural indignation, expressed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and shared by me, in the hope that it may hearten him to lay my letter before his master, and in the further hope that it will move the Imperial heart sufficiently to ensure that he will listen to the end. I have placed in the body of the letter a reference to your instructions regarding the' resumption of negotiations in the hope that he will demand to know at once what all this means, and then, perhaps, I shall be able to get at him. 20. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India (No. 236), His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad (No. 99) and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (No. 227). I have, &amp;c. R. H. HOARF. Enclosure in No. 1. Sir R. Hoare to Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs. My dear Minister, December 1, 1933. I CONSIDER it my duty to place before you in writing some of the remarks which I made to your Excellency on the subject of the paragraph which recently appeared in the Evening Standard with regard to His Majesty the Shah and the situation in Persia and to add some further reflections.s X Let me say in the first place that I understand and share to the full the icsent- ment which you expressed to me at a scurrilous libel directed against the peison of His Maiesty. . ^ ^ It was immediately realised at the Foreign Office that, m spite of the utter absurdity of the story, it was one which was liable to create a painful impression and steps were therefore taken to obtain the publication by the same paper on the following day of a denial of the story. The Foreign Office were clearly given understand that this denial would be of a quite categorical nature. I have n . yet received the text of it, but am distressed to learn from your Excellency that it cannot be so described. , . . . „ . , I must ask your Excellency to believe that it is materially impossible, under the British Constitution, to prevent the publication from time to time of merely foolish or obviously malicious articles. It is seldom thought wise to publish an expression of official disapproval for the sensible reason that to do so would inevitably give added prominence to the insult and possibly lead to further discussion and scandal. . Furthermore, if it became the practice to contradict officially statements made in the press the impression would possibly be created that any obviously malicious lie which had not been officially contradicted was approved by the Government, and that would be a catastrophe. I understood your Excellency to say that the item of “ gossip ” which we are discussing was regarded here as evidence of the existence of a clique whose object was to wreck the relations between our two countries. I wish to ensure that theie be no possibility of misunderstanding and I therefore remind your Excellency that when I last had the honour of being received by His Majesty I conveyed to him the most conclusive and formal evidence of the desire of my Sovereign and of his Government that those relations should be established on the firmest basis of friendship and I received from His Majesty the Shah an equally convincing statement that he and his Government reciprocated those sentiments. In the course of my recent conversation with your Excellency I communicated to you the contents of a telegram from my Government which I had at that moment received and I informed you that it was clear evidence that the views and intentions of His Majesty s Government were unchanged. In these circumstances I submit that to attach such importance to the writings of inconspicuous and irre sponsible journalists as to retard the attainment of the high purposes of the two Sovereigns and of their Governments would be deplorable and would, in effect, play into the hands of the clique which, if it does in fact exist, is endeavouring to thwart the accomplishment of our joint purpose. Lastly, I will permit myself to insist with emphasis on the fact that the views and intentions of His Majesty’s Government representing the vast majority of my nation are to be sought in the public statements of members of that Government and in the communications which are made to your Excellency through my intermediary or that of the Persian representative in London. I maintain that they are clear and unmistakable. R. H.

HOARE.COHJIDEMTIAL iJ.O.Ho.Jf.ii-N/ 33 * HEW DELHI, iatla December ■■■■■■■Mi 193 3. My dear Hoare, I notice that in your telegram No.36i, dated the bth December 19 33, you say that the Minister for Foreign Affairs made it plain that the reproduction of the 'Evening Standard' article in India had greatly affected the matter. So far as we have been able to discover by exhaustive search of the English and Vernacular Press in India, the only paper which re published the'Standard' article was the 'Hindustan Times' which has no particular importance and a very small circulation. The Persian Consul-General immediately wrote to the editor and a contradiction of the statements was duly published the following day. It may interest you also to know that the 'Times' article has only been republished by the 'Statesman', which is in very close relation with the 'Times' and probably reproduced the article more as a matter of routine than of special interest to India. It does not seem to have attracted any attention whatsoever in India (except from the Persian Consul-General) and no other paper has reproduced it. I have written to the editor asking him to be care ful in future not to publish anything which is likely to offend the Shah. I let you know these facts in order that you may be in a position to tell the Foreign Minister, if it is of assistance to you to do so, that neitner article has attracted any attention in the Indian Press nor achieved any publication except in the two newspapers mentioned above. I may also add for your own information that we took steps immediately on receiving your first telegram.•...- 2 - telegram to prevent unpleasant notices from appearing so far as we could do so. The 'Statesman* is unfortunately edited at Calcutta and it was the Main Office which did the reproduction. We are watching your difficulties with great interest and sympathy and are hoping tnat they may he resolved satisfactorily. Best wishes for Christmas and the New Year. I am sending a copy of this letter to Walton, as the India Office will prohahly he interested to know the reactions in India. Yours sincerely. Sd. H. A. J?.

Vensittert (who has been in charge of the Foreign Office in the absence of Secretary of State) to Persian Charge d’Affaires in London and by myself to His Highness the President of the Council of i inisters and to Your Excellency that His majesty'S Government greatly regret attacks on the Shah which have appeared in British press* Both Sir H. Vensittert and I have endeavoured to explain practical and constitutional difficulties in which His Lajesty's Government find themselves in cases of this naoure. ±nese difficulties are briefly that if they prosecute offending party they cannot prevent great publicity being given to the trial and that the only other course open to them is to remonstrate with the editor of the paper who may well resent these remonstrances and even use them as basis for further articles of an offensive nature. This danger is particularly present in the c'se of newspapers wnose aims and purposes do not correspond with those of the government of the day. It£ /'N O O o It Is the plainest truth that their very greet coxicern ior dignity of rxis imperial I-pjesty and their desire to safeguard good relations are reasons that deter ms hajesty's Government from tahinp action and public steps in this matter« Such steps would as I have explained above have precisely the opposite effect the more so that there is nothing more surely calculated to disturb British public opinion than suspicion that an cttempt is oeing made to establish any governmental control over the press. mis does not mean tnat within limits of their constitutional powers his majesty's Government do not wnen they have the opportunity exercise their influence to avert publication of sensational and libellous articles ouu tney cannot undertone to do that which it is not in their power to perform. addressed to Foreign Office ha,364, repeated to India ho.155 and Bushire ho.169.• u .J « &lt; , ' / } \ &gt; '-w- t -~J (E,7544^47/34.)

Your telegr.uns Ivios. 563 and 364 (of Doc ember 6th im English press criticism of Sheh). In view of what has already been said to Persian Charge d ! Affaires here, as recorded in my telegram Ho. 232 (of December 2nd), and repeated by you to Minister for Foreign Affairs (see paragraph 2 of your telegram No.360 (of December 5th), I think it will be preferable not to make further written communication to Persian Government on lines you propose. 2. In any case, terms of your suggested note would have required considerable modification. For instance difficulties in de?.ling with press cannot be described as 'constitutional'. They arise out of actual fact of freedom of press in democratic countries, and are in evitable part of whole system of individual liberty which is essential feature of Government of this country. Nor would it be accurate to describe tham as arising mainly out oi publicity which would be given to any prosecution of papers concerned. It is in fact more than doubtful whether either 'Evening Standard' paragraph of November 7th or 'Tines' article of November 23th could be held to provide basis either for a criminal prosecution by His Ilaj esty 1 s Government2 , GOvermerrt for def'dilatory libel or for a civil action by offended party for damages. There v/ould be no other means of obtaining- legal redress; but either course, even if it were practicable, would, in any case be open to gravest objections, and would lead to exaggerated importance and credence being given to press statements which have at present passed almost unnoticed. Generally speaking, by far the test line to t kc in regard to 'Evening Standard' article ie that already token by Sir K. Vansittart with Persian Charge d'Affaires. 3, As regards 'The Times' position, ns explained in my telegram No. 232 (of December 2nd), is somewhat different, but even here it is essential not to give impression that His Majesty's Government can exercise influence even on such reputable organs. There would, however, be no objection, if you think it desirable, to your drawing Persian Government’s attention orally to prominence given to Persian Charge d’Affaires' letter of November 30th and to Sir J.&gt; Cadnan's letter of December 7th. 4, Statement in brackets in paragraph 1 of your telegram No. 564 (of December 6th) is not accurate as I have been continuously here, but W ciS out of London on day when Persian Charge d’Affaires called.

The Minister for Foreign Affairs at once replied that I had given him nothing in writing. I caid that if he wished It I was prepared to do so hut should much prefer not to do so until the Shah had expressed a desire on the subject, as such an expression would show that things were going better. If they were not better there was the danger that the Shah migh reject our proposals in anger. The Minister for Foreign Affairs at first ex pressed a wish for a written communication uO whion i agreed. In the end, however, he said that it would be better to leave Basidu alone for the time oeing* Addressed to Foreign Office No. 334, repeated to India No. 157, Busnire No. 178«Minute 1712 10 Let ters to the Editor 17 MODERN PERSIA .

T1 T your Correspondent A ^ 1 feCl 1 mUSt d ° 50 Without rurtner delay, and only regret that these statements should have gone so lone uncontradicted by me. 8 Your Correspondent fails to recognize nothL 81 ^ CrSdit t0 the fact that nothing less than a revolution, involving a complete “breakaway” from the old vicious administration, has been :» ei ?Pi ed anc j lo a considerable extent effected by the Shah during the last seven years. This is the outstanding fact about the Shah’s achievement in the new Persia. This is overlooked oy your Correspondent; but he proceeds to affirm that true patriots in Persia are in f, minority which may be numbered on me ringers of one hand, and are not to be found in the chief places of the present Government. This kind of generalization is usually wide of the mark ; in this case it is manifestly untrue. His Majesty the Shah is as zealous a patriot as is to be found in any country ^ en u ta c° r occidental - In saying this I speak from at least as intimate a knowledge of the facts as that possessed oy your Correspondent. His Majesty’s ambition is to raise his country to the position of a highly-developed modern State. He proposes to utilize its natural resources to the full and to guide his people towards real independ ence and a position of self-reliance in the modern world. Modern Persia, under me Shahs leadership, is in process of raising the structure of a modern pro gressive country upon the foundations other ancient renown. In this endeavour his Majesty is most careful in selecting as ms officials men who share his ideals and do their best to execute his orders Your Correspondent affirms that the police and army officers may, and do be have as they like without fear of ’any reprimand for misdemeanours. This is too sweeping a statement to pass without protest. I myself am aware of incidents that show that it is not correct. Where an energetic Sovereign is attempting so much, abuses may at times be practised in his name, but when brought to light are apt to receive condign punishment As the writer of the article makes mention of me personally, I have no hesi tation in commenting on his allegation that foreigners in Persia have suffered in consequence of the agreement reached bv my company with the Persian Govern- ment i a m in a position to state definitely that this contention is inaccurate. Thut the Shah requires special protec tion need occasion no comment ;• the same is true of most heads of States. But the distances recently covered by his Majesty m the course of the tours of inspection which are a feature of his rule and a proof of his energy, are really remarkable. From my visits to Persia, I have no hesihffion m stating that the condition of affairs within recent years in Persia has improved beyond recognition ; but Rome was not built in a day, and the reorganiza tion of a whole empire will require time, and surely it must be obvious that foreign misrepiesentations of any incident that may occur are not calculated to promote good will or to encourage Persia in her present aspirations.

The object of such attacks was to irritate, and it would only play into the hands of the attackers to pay the slightest attention to them, 3, Sir H«&gt; Vansittart asked M c Moury to give a personal message to the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs from him in the above sense ~ and he hoped it would be transmitted, to the Shell - adding that his own personal advice was that His Imperial Majesty should trice the same lino as Mr* Baldwin and other leading Englishmen, and treat it as entirely beneath his dignity to pay any attention to what might he said in such scurrilous journals. Contemptible publication should be treated with contempt. Sir K.Vansittarb was prepared, if after this advice the Persian Government still so desired, to send for the Editor of the 'Evening Standard' and speak to him very strongly about the paragraph which had appeared* In his own view, however, such a course would be 8- mistake, and ho did not adr/ise the Persian Government to take it. It was unlikely to prove effective, and the only other remedy, which would do an action in the Courts, would, be open to grave objections from the Persian point of view and only make matters worse. Sir P. /unsittart was just as sorry as the Persian Government that such a paragraph should have appeared, but differed from them in the importance which should be attached to it.4* He wished to add two points. In the first place could not accept the reference in the Persian note to the freedom of the press being invoked as an 'excuse'. It was a pure matter of fact which anyone with any know ledge of the pross in a democratic country must realise. The licence of the press was even greater in France and in the United States. Secondly, he wished to make it clear that if he was prepared to summon the Editor of the 'Evening Standard' and speak to him as he had suggested - though he did not advise this course - his willingness to take this action was due solely to his friendly feelings towards Persia e He wished to make it quite clear that he was not offering to take it under the influence of the threat contained at the end of the Persian note, which he could only regard as quite inappropriate in the circuit- stances. 5. The Persian Chargfi d 1 Affaires then raised the question of the deplorable article which appeared in the '11:1168' of November 23th„ Sir R* Vansittart said that this case was quite different since the 'Times' was a respectable paper, whose Editor would no doubt regret this unfortunate incident as much as did His Majesty’s Government.

He argued that this and previous attacks on the Shah indicated existence of some clique which wished ill to Persia and he was not sure of attitude of His Majesty’s Government, I replied that we would assume for the sake of argument that* this clique existed; by taking present line the Shah was playing straight into their hands as I presumed he did not imagine had relations with us would not he had for Persia, As for the attitude of His Majesty’s Government telegram which I had just received showed that it was entirely friendly. 2, When I had given him the sense of it, he half heartedly suggested that it did not amount to much, I replied I refused to believe that hut for this wretched newspaper paragraph he would not have received it with profound sa.tisfaction 0 His only answer was indication of great regret and despondency.

In reply to a direct question regarding their nature he said that failing 'satisfaction' possibility of breaking off relations was contemplated and he appealed for my help. When I had explained in detail and with emphasis how fantastic action of 3hah was, which he did not attempt to deny, I told him nature of instructions in your telegram No. 223 and said that I presumed that this striking evidence of goodwill of His Majesty’s Govern ment would entirely satisfy the Shah and that instructions to Charge d’Affaires would be (? obsolete).

I therefore told him I feared impression produced would probably be that great matters of state were handled with levity and that it was useless to make any further attempt to deal with a man v/ho allowed irritation over a triviality to wreck relations of vital importance to his countryo 3. At no stage did Minister for Foreign Affairs make the slightest attempt to refute me but repeatedly begged me in the interests of Persia to seek some means of appeasing Shah and made one or two tentative suggestions which I had to tell him were either ridiculous or liable if adopted to make matters worse, 4, Shah is evidently a complete maniac where he believes his personal prestige is concerned.
