December 24,1951 Peer »4uesue ^ In the course of the Resident’s visit here, we discussed with S r 0PG the question of obtaining the Sultan’s ap roval of the Flamingo’s proposed visit to Bandar Khairam, Sur and Masirah, which I undertood to secure urgently, although no official request had yet arrived here through the Residency. 2. Today there has arrived from the Residency, n t a re uest that I obtain the Sultan’s sanction, but a copy of a letter from Graham to 3N0PG conveying approval of the trip. Surely something has gone wrong s .mewhere. Nothing further need be done in connexion with this particular visit, since I have already ap roached the Muscat! authorities - indeed, by the time you see this, I hope you will also have the answer. But there seems to be some need for a recognised procedure. C.M. Le Quesne, Esq., British Residency, Bahrain. Yours sinoerely f J # Gethln INDEXThe Political Agent, Muscat.
