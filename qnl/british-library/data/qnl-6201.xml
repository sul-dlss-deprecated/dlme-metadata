No. 433, dated Maskat, the 27th September 1902. Irom Major P. Z. Cox, I.S.C., C.I.E., His Britannic Majesty’s Consul and Political Agent, Maskat, To—The Under-Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department I have the honour to acknowledge with thanks the receipt of your letter No. 1755-E.A., dated 28th August, on the subject of the transfer of property in Oman. 2. I beg in the first instance to explain further the two points of Maskat usage in regard to which your letter expressed some uncertainty (a) The law regarding the alienation of wakf property in Maskat is the same as that holding in India, but the difficulty is that Arab subjects in charge of obscure wakf property have been found tempted, when in want of money, to mortgage such property secretly to Banyans on the pretence that it is private property, and it may not be for many years afterwards that the death of the mortgagor or his failure to pay the interest causes the Banyan to bring the case mto Court. Then the defence is set up by the man or his heirs that the property was wakf and ought never to have been mortgaged; sometimes with reason and sometimes with intent to defraud. (b) It is the usage in Maskat for the complainant to be sent for justice, by his national representative, to His Highness the Sultan if the defendant is a Maskat subject and to the defendanVs consular representative if the defendant is a foreign subject. The com plainant’s Consul or the Sultan (in the case of an Arab) has the right of sending a representative to attend the trial, if he so desires. 3. The suggestion contained in the concluding paragraph of your letter seems to provide, as far as is possible under the circumstances, the remedy that my reference contemplated. On receipt of your communication I dis cussed the subject with the Sultan, and we both came to the conclusion that it would not be possible to trust to any system of registration conducted by his clerical establishment, he, therefore, undertook, by officially promulgating it in Arabic, among his own subjects, to make applicable to them any notifU cation I might draw up affecting British subjects. . 4- Under ordinary circumstances I should have first submitted a draft notification to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, for approval, but there were strong reasons existing connected with Monsieur Goguyer’s present active intrigues which made it important to act at once. I therefore issued on I3th instant, in anticipation of sanction, the notification, of which I attach a copy for the information of the Government, together with a copy of my covering letter to the Secretary of State. 5. I have purposely left out any special mention of the fact that any document executed in contravention of the notification would not be recog nised at this Consulate, as, had I done so, it would have been necessary to acfd some qualifying words, such as, “so far as it affects the British subject.” So far as our subjects are concerned, however, the mere fact that the non-regis tration is made penal, carries with it the fact that any such unregistered document is invalid for purposes of a civil court, 908 F.

Cox, I.S.C., C.I.E., His Britannic Majesty's Consul and Political Agent, Maskat, p To—The Eight Hon'ble the Marquess of Lansdowne, K.G., P.C., etc., His Majesty's Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. I have the honour to submit copy of a notification which I issued in Maskat on 13th instant with the concurrence of His Highness the Sultan, who has promulgated a copy of it for the information of his own subjects. 2. I consulted the Government of India as to the general position in this connection, but the notification has not been issued with their authority, as there were urgent reasons for the issue of something of the sort wfithout delay, and the responsibility for the form of the notification is therefore my own. I trust it will meet with Your Lordship’s concurrence and approval. The reasons for the issue of the notice are twofold :— (I) The British Indian (Hindu Banya) traders of Maskat and other ports of Oman, who are mostly usurers, have become a necessity to the Arabs, but at the same time occupy in their eyes much the same position as the Jew usurer does in Europe, and it is one of the chief difficulties which British representatives in Oman have to contend with, and is an increasing one. In the course of their business these Banyas frequently advance money to Arabs on the security of deeds hypothecating their houses and landed property, situated sometimes at long distances from the coast; and saying nothing about them at the time, produce the deeds years afterwards with the complaint that the mortgagor cannot redeem the property and claim their Consul’s interference, to put them in possession. Not to interfere is to some extent damaging to British prestige; to interfere is to sow a considerable amount of anti-British feeling among the inhabitants of Oman which we can ill afford to do at the present day. The notification under report was devised primarily as a remedy to the above state of things. (n) The reason for its immediate urgency is a different one. Most of the desirable building sites in Maskat belong to British Indian subjects, many of whom ate not too scrupulous. There is no doubt that intrigues are now going on, with Monsieur Goguyer for their medium, for the furtherance of Russian aims in Maskat. My French colleague told me con fidentially only a few days ago that he knew the individual above mentioned to be endeavouring to get made Consular Agent for Russia, and the Russian Consul-General at Bushire has twice addressed letters to the Sultan in which he expresses the hope of paying his respects to him at an early date. The first thing they will need to do will be to effect the purchase of a suitable building site, and it is very necessary that His Majesty’s Consul should be in a position to know what is going on in that direction as far as possible, in view of the fact, before mentioned, that most of the desirable sites are the property of British Indians. 3. The notification only applies to British subjects and, by reason of the Sultan’s publishing a copy of it, to Arab subjects; and I am not forgetful of Jss % 'i Acquisition of property in Maskat by foreigners. the fact that the British Consul could not, on the strength of it, refuse to recognise a transfer of property in any dispute in which the transferee was a Russian or a Frenchman, but it seemed undesirable either directly or indirectly to draw special attention to the above application of it, and in its present form it will in all likelihood suffice to deter British subjects from entering into any negociations of the sort apprehended, and that is all that it is required to effect. 4. It has been brought to my notice, during the week, that Monsieur Goguyer ha&lt; taken a careful copy of it from the Notice-Board, and there can be little doubt but that he will endeavour to make mischief out of it if he can see any means of doing so. I submit, however, that the form of it gives the French no grounds for objection, and that, if Monsieur Goguyer should make much of it, it will be proof of the fact that something of the sort was called for.

From The Under secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, To Lajor F.Z.Gox,C•I.E., Political Agent at Laskat. Dated Simla,the ~ August 1SC2. - v . Sir, When you were in Simla last month,you enqujrecL whether any objection could be raised to the issue of an order by the Sultan to the effect that the acquisition of property in Laskat by foreign subjects will not be recognised unless it is registered by the Sultan (or by the officer deputed by him) before the transfer of the property takes place.You observe that,if such an order were issued,the Sultan would know before-hand when the transfer of any altered or religious property was contemplated,and might take steps accordingly,e.g.,in the case of foreclosure on a mortgage he could pay off the mort^gage himself, if lie so desired. You also enquired whether,with a view to prevent the sale other' by British Indian traders of houses or^property to French or Russian purchasers,it would he possible for you ; as British Consul^ to issue an order to the effect that sales of immoveable property in Laskat by British subjects will not be recognised unless regis- -tered in the British Consular Court before the actual transfer. 2. In reply to your enquiries,! am directed to convey the following instructions:- With regard to the first proposal,it is clear that Article 5 of the Treaty of 1891 with Laskat does not supersede the ordinary rule of private international law,under which transfer of immoveable property is governed by the lex loci .It merely permits British subjects to acquire or alienate property by any mode legally opento the Sultan's subjects.There is no objection to the issue by the Gultan of a law requiring registration for the purpose of giving him notice of the contemplated acquisition of property by foreigners. It is not,however,• clear from the terms of your reference whether the precise effect of the proposed order has been properly understood It is not known what the local law in I'askat as to the alienation of v/ akf property may be; but,assuming it to be the same as in India, the issue of the proposed order would not,it is considered^enable the money-lender to sell up any such property which is not alienable at present.On the other hand,if the local law permits the alienation of v/akf property,and if the Gultan sees a pious duty in saving such property from passing to others than Muhammadans,the issue of the proposed order will no doubt give him an opportunity of performing that duty. 0. As regards the second question,it is not clear by what authority a dispute between a British subject on the one part and a French or Russian subject on the other is decided.By article 13 of thejlreaty of 1891, the Gultan has divested himself of jurisdiction^ but by article 6 of the Order in Council,dated the 4th November 1867,His Britannic Majesty's Consul is invested with jurisdiction only in disputes arising between British subjects.If the idea is simply to define the limits of diplomatic redress,there is no objec tion to your declaring that you will not exert yourself in the A, case of any transfer to any subject of any other Christian State, unless such transfer has,previously to its completion,been notified to you. Furthermore,under Article l,of the same Order,you might frame a r^ile for the peace,order and good government of His Majesty's subjects prohibiting them,under penalty of fine,from transferring property without registration,and could give some effect to such • ** r- jl igagr - a rule by declining to recognise such a transfer in the exercise of your jurisdiction under article 6.It would not,however,be per- -missible for you to refuse,in the terms proposed,to recognise the transfer in any dispute in which the French or Russian transferee was concerned.You could not,for example,sell a building,which had oeen so transf erred,in execution of a decree against the Britishtransferor,or insist on administering it for the benefit of his legal representatIves•In such cases,you would be bound to recognise the transfer,unless the French or Russian authorities could be induced to enforce a similar rwei rule for their own suojects.

No. 1755-E.A., dated Simla, the 28th August 1902. p rom The Under-Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, To Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Agent at Maskat. When you were in Simla last month, you enquired whether any objection could be raised to the issue of an order by the Sultan to the effect that the acquisition of property in Maskat by foreign subjects will not be recognised unless it is registered by the Sultan (or by the officer deputed by him) before the transfer of the property takes place.

ACQUISITION OP PROPERTY IN MASKAT BY FOREIGNERS. No. 1755-E.A., dated Simla, the 28th August 1902. From-—The Uuder-Secretary to the Government o£ India in the Foreign Department, To— Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Agent at Maskat. When you were in Simla last month, you enquired whether any objection could be raised to the issue of an order by the Sultan to the effect that the acquisition of property in Maskat by foreign subjects will not be recognised unless it is registered by the Sultan (or by the officer deputed by him) before the transfer of the property takes place. You obseryed that, if such an order were issued, the Sultan would know beforehand when the transfer of any sacred or religious property was contemplated, and might take steps accordingly, e.g, in the case of foreclosure on a mortgage he could pay off the mortgage him self, if he so desired. You also enquired whether, with a view to prevent the sale by British Indian traders of houses or other property to French or Russian purchasers, it would be possible for you, as British Consul, to issue an order to the effect that sales of immoveable property in Maskat by British subjects will not be recog nised unless registered in the British Consular Court before the actual transfer. 2. In reply to your enquiries, I am directed to convey the following instructions:— With respect to the first proposal, it is clear that Article 5 of the Treaty of 1891 with Maskat does not supersede the ordinary rule of private international law, under which transfer of immoveable property is governed by the lex loci. It merely permits British subjects to acquire or alienate property by any mode legally open to the Sal tan’s subjects. There is no objection to the issue by the Sultan of a law requiring registration for the purpose of giving him notice of the contemplated acquisition of property by foreigners. It is not, however, clear from the terms of your reference whether the precise effect of the proposed order has been properly understood. It is not known what the local law in Maskat as to the alienation of wakf property may be ; hut, assuming it to be the same as in India, the issue of the proposed order would not, it is considered, enable the money-lender to sell up any such property which is not alien able at present. On the other hand, if the local law permits the alienation of wakf property, and if the Sultan sees a pious duty in saving such property from passing to others than Muhammadans, the issue of the proposed order will no doubt give him an oppor tunity of performing that duty. 3. As regards the second question, it is not clear by what authority a dis pute between a British subject on the one part and a French or Russian subject on the other is decided. By Article 13 of the Treaty of 1891, the Sultan has divested himself of jurisdiction; but by Article 6 of the Order in Council, dated the 4th November 1867, His Britannic Majesty’s Consul is invested with jurisdiction only in disputes arising between British subjects. If the idea is simply to define the limits of diplomatic redress, there is no objection to your declaring that you will not exert yourself in the case of any transfer to any subject of any other Christian State, unless such transfer has, previously to its completion, been notified to you. Furthermore, under Article 1 of the same Order, you might frame a rule for the peace, order and good government of His Majesty’s subjects, prohibiting 563 F.

Sir The Marquess of La.nsdoTOe has received your des patch of the 21st of September, submitting for ap proval a copy of a Notification which you have Issued wltii regard to certain Regulations made by you under ’’The Muscat Order in Council, 1857”, in respect of the registration of transfers of real pro perty from or to British Subjects or British protect ed persons. I am directed by His Lordship to call your atten tion to the despatch addressed to you on the 16th ol February, 1901, inclosing for your information and guidance printed instructions respecting the issue of Regulations, &amp;c., under Orders in Council, which had been drawn up in this Department for the guidance of His Majesty’s Consular Officers, with a. view to insuring Major Cox, C.I .E., His Majesty’s Consul, Muscat.insuring harmony and regularity in dealing with these matters. You acknowledge the receipt of the instructions lii a despatch ds Led the 16th ot March^ 1901^ hut you have not followed them in drawing up 3 ^our Notifica tion. I transmit to you herewith hy Lord Lansdowne’s directions, an amended draft Notice, framed in ac cordance with the Instructions. In the Notification Issued hy you, the incorrect expression 'British protected Subjects' has been used. This term would imply that there are two classes of British Subjects, one of which is protected and the other not; whereas the distinction which it was intend ed to emphasize was that existing between British Sub jects on the one hand, and, on the other 'British protected persons',the latter not being British Sub jects, but persons who, although not possessed of British nationality, are yet afforded British protec tion. You will observe that the error has been rec tified in the amended draft Notice.The draft is forwarded to you in order that. whilst preserving its form, you may make any altera tions in its language which you may consider desir able, and afterwards submit it for Lord Lansdowne’s approval, following the procedure prescribed in the Instructions. Under Article 2 of the Muscat Order in Council the Notification already Issued by you will remain in force until it is disallowed by the Secretary of State. Lord Lansdowne's disallowance will be signi fied to you when His Lordship's approval of Hie new Notice is communicated to you. I am to instruct you to be careful in future, in issuing Regulations, &amp;c., under the Muscat Order in Council, to be guided by the General Instructions sent to you on Hie 16th of February, 1901.
