SIRE, Had the following pages contained nothing more than an account given by myself of the affairs of Persia during a certain period, it would have been in me an unpardonable presumption to have solicited the high honour of a permission to prefix to them your majesty's august name ; but as they contain the Translation of a MS. compiled by order of the Sovereign of Persia under his own eye, a Copy of which was presented to me by His Persian Majesty's command when I left that country, I ventured to ask that I might be allowed to lay that Translation, accompanied by my own imperfect Notes, at your majesty's feet. The gracious condescension with which your majesty was pleased to receive that request, is an honour which I cannot too highly prize ; affording me, as it does, an opportunity to declare myself, with profound respect, your majesty's Most dutiful Subject and devoted Servant, HARFORD JONES BRYDGES.NOTICE TO THE READER. The Manuscript, of which some of the following pages contain the translation, was given to me by his Persian Majesty, through my old and excellent friend Mirza Bazurg, the Ka'imacam of Persia. It had been promised to me very shortly after my arrival at the Persian Court; but circumstances pre vented the delivery of it, till the very eve of my departure from Teheran; and it was then in great haste copied from the original in the possession of the King. When the Manuscript was at last * delivered to me, Mirza Bazurg thought it necessary to apologize for the little beauty f of the hand-writing in which it was transcribed, as well as for the poverty of the illumination and binding; being pleased to say, that my departure from Persia taking place sooner than * The MS. was despatched to me ; and reached me at Erzeroum, on my way to England. It lay many hours under water, with some other things, when La Pomone was wrecked, t Literally translated. aii NOTICE his Persian Majesty expected, was the only cause of his sending the work in a form so ill suited to a royal present*. The Manuscript commences with the usual pious exordium prefixed to all Muhammedan works: it proceeds with a brief account of the origin ot the Kajar Family; of the transactions of his present Majesty's uncle, Akau Muhammed Khan, who was murdered in his tent at Sheshah, in the spiing of 1797, and to whom Faty Aly Shah succeeded in 1798; and it ends at my departure from Persia, in 1811. One motive for undertaking and publishing the translation of this MS. at the present moment, after so much in all shapes has been lately put forth about Persia, is, that, from its containing an account * The Persians, as is well known to those conversant in Oriental Literature, go to an expense in the binding and illumination of their Manuscripts which is scarcely to be credited in Europe. Mirza Muhammed Husain, who was successively Vizir to Sadik Khan, Jaafer Khan, and Lutf Aly Khan, Princes of the Zend Dynasty, was considered to possess the most valuable library then in Persia. Amongst his books were several, the covers of which were a thin plate of pure gold, beautifully enamelled, and further enriched with small jewels. The silken cord or headband at the top and bottom of the binding, to which the leaves are attached, is, in Per sian, called Shirauzee; from whence it may, perhaps, be concluded that this method of binding was first practised at Shiraz. It is common also with the Persians to keep the works they most higlily esteem in boxes, or caskets, profusely and richly ornamented: and this seems to have been a very ancient custom ; for it appears that, amongst many other rich articles which Alexander found belonging to Darius/was a superb casket, which the Macedonian Prince after wards destined to contain a copy of Homer's Poems.to the reader. Ill of the transactions of that kingdom 'during a period at which Persia has been more concerned in the affairs of Europe and India than she had been for many years preceding, it is imagined there may per haps be curiosity enough still left in the world to read the tale of those transactions told by the Per sians themselves. There is in the Court of Persia M an officer styled Wakaa neveisf, or ' writer of daily public occurrencesthe labours of this officer are regularly communicated to the King, and are ad mitted or corrected under his Majesty's inspection. The MS. therefore now offered in translation to the public, is, as far as regards the period it em braces of his present Majesty's reign, a copy of that State Record. t There is reason for believing such an office has existed in very times of the Persian Monarchy, and was considered as conferring great dignity and importance. In the 2d chapter of Esdras, we find ' Rathimus, the Story Writer/' addressing Artaxerxes on the subject of rebuilding the Temple at Jerusalem. The \ ulgate translation of the verse containing this notice runs thus : ' Domine ! pueri tui Rathimus ab accidentibus, et Sabellius scnba, et reliqui curiae tuae judices in Coelesyria et Phoenice ' cap. ii. p. 255. Paris ed. 1785. Various are the instances, in Scripture, of orders given in Persia to search the Records of the Kingdom. Koempfer thus describes it« Wakaa neveis, id est, ' Scn ^ occurrentium rerum; vocatur etiam Fizeer e chep, id &lt;t e . St '. 1Sinu3 sinistr ®. quoniam in senaculo sedem in latere ad ^ simstram regis occupat.

Kcempfer, Fascic. 1. a 2iv notice Herodotus observes, that one part oi the ancient education of the Persian Youth was teaching them to speak the truth*. I am not aware that this Prince of Science is pretended now to be taught in any of the schools or Madressas in Persia: and therefore, if it be found that the MS. sometimes varies in the account it gives of a particular trans action from that received from other quarters, can dour will suggest some allowance to be made for national vanity; and more for the very delicate ear of the principal person to whom the original was recited, and by whose command it was compiled. Moreover, it must be confessed that the modern Persians amongst us Europeans have not a very high reputation for a strict regard to truth ; and perhaps the charge made against them on this head, in some instances, may not be totally groundless : it will be well, however, before a decisive opinion is pro nounced by us on this subject, to make allowance for the nature and idiom of their language, which is elevated, poetical, and periphrastic; and to bear in mind, that Truth and Poetry are frequently at * Parents, in correcting the mean vice of lying, shonld be careful to distinguish the degree of crime incurred by a lie as to fact and a He as to inaccurate description. Viz. A child leaves a candle burning in a room—is accused of doing so, and denies it: this is a lie as to fact. Another comes into a room, and tells his parent, ' I have seen a snake twenty yards longthis may probably be a lie only as far as regards inaccurate description. We should treat the first as moral guilt, and the second as moral folly. A wise parent surely will not use the same means to correct both.to the reader. v variance f. If we examine closely, it will be found that the quantum of lying amongst any given num ber of nations, as compared with each other, does not vary so much as we are at first inclined to imagine. The main difference, generally speaking, is in the subject of the lie, and the purpose for which it is told: and I cannot think myself very rash in saying, that, where interest is concerned, I have often found Europeans as ready to deviate from the truth as Persians. Few circumstances can be imagined, in the common intercourses of life, in commerce, in diplomacy, in which I have not had communica tions with Persians; and I assert, from long expe- t The colloquial language of Persia is more hyperbolical per haps than any other. A Persian does not scruple using to one's face such expressions as these: ' Your wisdom is greater than that of Aristotle ' Your courage is superior to that of Alexander ' The fame of your reputation and glory fills the whole world such are phrases of common parlance: and thus, by constantly using words to which he attaches no precise meaning, the Persian easily slides into lies of inaccurate description; and the transition from moral folly to moral guilt is, alas ! but too easy: ' Facilis descensus Averni/' It is but fair, however, to add, that when these sort of compliments are paid, a Persian may be generally considered as practising that species of polite conversation which is known in Persia by the term Reeshcund, and in England by that of quizzing. Many have witnessed, and laughed at, the droll scene in the Bourgeois Cientilhomme of Moliere, Act. VI., without being aware how severe a slap that admirable comic writer has given therein to the colloquial idiom of the Turks. Clionte personates the son of the Grand Turk, and is made to address Monsieur Jourdain: Ahousahum oqui boraf Giourdina Islamelequiwhich Covielle explains to be, ' Monsieur Jourdain, votre cocur soit toute Tannee comme un rosier fleuriand adds, ' Ces sont fagon de parler oblige antesyi notice rience, that truer friends, or more honourable dealing men than the generality of their merchants, do not exist. The Persian diplomatists I have treated with did not, in their intercourse or transactions with me, go beyond what is considered allowable to such persons; and, as far as I have been concerned with them, that which has been once agreed on has been strictly acted up to and performed. When confidence is merited, it is generally obtained; and obligeantes de ce pays la.' And, again, ' Oustin salemelequi basam basa alia moram;' which, Covielle tells Jourdain, means, 'Que le del vous donne la force des lions et la prudence-des serpens.' The lower class of Moollahs or Priests, who in Persia are gene rally extremely illiterate, and consequently vulgar and self-con ceited, are famous for greedily swallowing this sort of flattery. The following anecdote, mentioned by Bernier, will shew, how ever, how such compliments are replied to by persons of judgment and spirit. Bernier was retained in the service of a Persian nobleman, named Danishmend Khan, at the court of Aurengzebe; and he relates, ' Q'un Pendet ou docteur Gentil que j'avois fait mettre au service de mon Agah (i.e. Danishmend Khan) se voulut meler en entrant de faire son panegyrique, et apres I'avoir compare aux plus grands conquerans, qui furent jamais, etlui avoit dit cents grossieres et impertinentes flatteries, conclusit en fin serieusement par celle-ci: 4 Lorsque vous mettez le pied dans I'etrier, seigneur, et vous marchez a cheval avec votre cavalrie, la terre tremble sous vos pas ; les huits elefans qui la supportent sur leurs tetes ne pouvant soutenir ce grand effort.' Je ne puis me tenir de tire la-dessus, et je tachai de dire serieusement h mon Agah, qui ne pouvoit s'en tenir, qu'il soit done fort a propos qu'il ne montat a cheval que fort rarement pour empecher les tremblemens de terre qui causent souvent de si grands malheurs. 4 Avissi est-ce pour cela meme me,' r^pondit-il, sans hesiter, * que je me fais ordinairement porter en Paleky.' ' Bernier, vol. ii. p. 46. Ed. Amster.to the reader. vii a Persian grants it in a manner equally creditable to the receiver and the giver; instances of which, it is presumed, will appear in the Notes to the transla tion of the MS. Knaves and fools are to be found in every part of the world: ' Quae regio in terris nostri non plena laborls.' I consider it the imperative duty of a translator neither to curtail nor to augment the text of the original which he undertakes to translate; and therefore, though the present version might, in the reader's opinion, be possibly benefitted by the pruning-knife, I have not considered myself at liberty to use it. The reader will be sure, if he finds it necessary, to exert his long-established and undoubted privilege of passing over such parts as appear to him dull and uninteresting; and I may, perhaps, have reason to be very thankful if he does not throw the whole down in disgust. If such, un fortunately, should be the case, it will be some consolation to reflect, that my partners in the work will be but little affected by the disgrace that has befallen me; that the report of the misfortune will not reach them; and that, as far as regards myself, though I have failed to amuse the reader and to merit his approbation, the employment of getting up the volumes has induced so many recollections of the past, always associated with feelings of grati tude, regard, and respect, towards several of theviii NOTICE persons mentioned in the MS. and the Notes, that it has been to me (whatever the produce of it may be to the reader) one of peculiar pleasuic and in terest. Those scenes in which we were engaged in early life, and which were agreeable to us at that time, (and mine in Persia, from a variety of circum stances, were peculiarly so to me,) the mind aftei- wards falls back, on, with no common fondness; and at the close of life, few things are moie chceiing, than to recall to our thoughts the first impressions made on us by what we met with in youth, when vi siting distant countries—the acquaintances we made; the friendships we formed there ; the kindnesses we received; the mutual efforts made to amuse, to please and inform each other, and the joyous hours spent in the society of amiable and intelligent foreigners; and, in this instance, I may add, in a most luxurious climate, and amidst scenery where brilliancy and picturesque beauty increased the charm of novelty. Reader, it is neither my wish nor my intention to detain you much longer, nor to dilate on so poor a subject as myself; but it seems fair to both par ties, that I should lay before you some short account of the means I have had of becoming acquainted with Persia and its inhabitants, in order that you may the better appreciate the observations on them which I shall hereafter present to you. As a strangerto the reader. ix and an humble individual, I was long ago admitted L y in Persia to a considerable degree of intimacy with Princes, Ministers, men of the Law, merchants, m shopkeepers, and agriculturists. I then mixed in society in Persia, at different times, from the Zenith n - to the Nadir of it. I was present in Shiraz when r- the abominable treachery of Hajy Ibrahim to his id benefactor, and too-confiding master and sove- g, reign, transferred the throne of Persia from the tis Family of Zend to that of Kajar. I afterwards n- waited on the gallant and unfortunate Lutf Aly e; Khan, in his distress, by the desire of his fallen *ve Minister, Mirza Muhammed Husain, whose guest to I was at Shiraz : and the last time I visited Per ns sia, I had the high honour to appear there as the :nt First Minister in modern times, regularly accredited i a from the Sovereign of this country to the Sove- ;re reign of that. The space of time consumed in my he acquaintance and intercourse with Persia and Per sians was near thirty years; and it is now not far from twenty years since I left that country, on The estimate I have made of the Persian cha- )or racter may be different from that made by others: ar- and I acknowledge, that, in pourtraying their cha- int racter, it would be difficult for me to repel—and ted indeed I should despise myself, if I wished to repel— rou those feelings which I must ever cherish, for kind- em ness and attention received in sickness, for acts of ger the most disinterested friendship received in casesx notice. of unexpected and most dangerous personal emer gency, and for unparalleled proofs of confidence, generosity, and attachment received, when beaten to the ground by those who ought to have sup ported me. Had I the power of being witty (which I have not) at the expense of a people who possess so many good traits of character, and who, on all occasions, behaved so nobly and generously to me, I should merit severe censure if I exerted it. What national failings they have, I am as well acquainted with as any of my countrymen can be: and such of my countrymen as had the opportunity of witness ing how I dealt with the Persians on the spot, I am confident will attest, that, from the King to the clown, no one ever told them harsher or plainer truths than I did. I scorned to flatter them in Persia; and I will not, at this distance, speak disre spectfully of them in England. Reader! I put such of the following pages as are strictly mine into your hands, with a proper diffi dence as to their value; still hoping they may afford you some amusement: to learn which, will give me pleasure. So, with the old Latin Comedian, I say, ' Valetebut I dare not add, as he does, ' Plaudite.'to the reader. xi POSTSCRIPT. Before proceeding further, however, I feel bound to perform a very pleasing task—that of acknow ledging the assistance I have received. To Mr. David Shea , of Hayleybury College, I am much indebted for great assistance in the translation of the MS. : but I am in honour bound to declare, that whatever fault is discovered in that translation, the blame of it rests solely on myself; since there is no part of the text which I have not carefully and sedulously revised: and when my idea of the sense of the MS. has differed from his, I have adopted my own, in preference to his. To a Gentleman, whose name at present I am not at liberty to mention, but who is at once the delight of his friends and an honour to the sacred profes sion which he has embraced, I am indebted for the kindest encouragement—encouragement, without which I doubt if I should have ventured to appear, either as Translator or Author, before the public. To my old and highly-valued friend. Colonel James Sutherland , of the East-India Company's Bombay Military Establishment—to him I was in debted, during my residence in Persia, for his uni form friendship and effective assistance. On the present occasion I am indebted to him for the beau-Xll to Tin: READER. tiful and accurate Map which accompanies the work, as well as for the very curious Specimens of Maps, made by Native Persians, which are presented to the reader in this volume : and could I flatter myself that my part of the book was as well worth the notice of the public as Colonel Sutherland's Map, I should feel more confident of the approba tion of my readers and purchasers than I do at present. If the Rev. Dr. Bandinell , the Librarian of the Bodleian, will accept my thanks, they are certainly due to him, for the kindness and politeness with which he afforded me at all times access, during a residence last winter at Oxford, to that magni ficent treasure of literature, of which he has the care. The appearance of the work has been much delayed by a personal calamity of the heaviest nature. It has pleased Providence to close for ever that voice, the sounds of which, if I should succeed, would have enhanced the pleasure of success; and which, if I fail, would have been affectionately employed to soothe and mitigate the bitterness of disappointment. N!( xiii ) PRELIMINARY MATTER. SECT. I. When I first determined to offer to the public notice the following Translation, I did not think of accompanying it by any thing more than such Notes as I imagined might amuse the Reader or elucidate the Text. A little reflection, however, satisfied me that it might not be amiss to take a wider range : in consequence of which, the following Preliminary Matter has been compiled. In entering on the Ancient History of Persia, of which it does not come within my scheme to give more than a precis, I must immediately acknow ledge the use I have made of that part of Malcolm's copious work; and also avow, how sincerely I con sider such as are interested about Persian and Indian History or Politics to be indebted to him for his useful, entertaining, and well-arranged labours on those subjects : and if, in the course of any thing I shall have occasion to publish in the present pages, I differ from him in opinion, it will always (except on facts) be with a degree of respect for his know ledge of the matter in hand. From the authorities he quotes in his History of Persia, he appears to have perused and examined many and various Arabian and Persian authors who have written on Versia. Some of these I, also, have been formerly acquainted with; and I am not aware that in otherxiv preliminary matter. languages many works on this subject have escaped fa my notice i but as lar as intercom se with Persia, g( and its inhabitants can fit me for the task I have la undertaken, I can safely say, mine was longer, and tl more varied in its nature, than that of any of my tc countrymen. I have, however, one serious cause tl for alarm, that is, of being accused of taking the vi best part of my book from the labours of others. sj To this charge I plead guilty; and throw myself on pi the Reader's mercy. ^1; h The geographical limits of the Kingdom of Persia, ^ which both in ancient and modern times have so ^ often varied, from invasion and other causes, seem ^ to me better noticed, when necessary, under par- ticular reigns, or at certain epochs, than in any ^ other manner; and short statistical accounts of ^ particular provinces will be better introduced in a _ note, when such provinces are alluded to in the ^ MS., than given under any general arrangement. ^ With those who credit the Mosaical account of ^ the creation of the world (and it will not be very ^ easy for those who do not to produce one more ^ credible) there will be no great difficulty to imagine c] that many countries which formerly have and do G now constitute a part of the Persian Empire must fr have been very early peopled. The vicinity to ^ that empire of the spot where mankind is first re- ^ corded to have appeared, the facile means possessed ^ of exploring, as the race increased, some of its most beautiful and fertile provinces, justify, in my mind, n a supposition to this effect. But, at all events, when destmction was first poured on the primitive o inhabitants of this globe, and only Noah and hispreliminary matter. xv family were especially protected and saved from the general wreck, the same divine authority that re lates to us the dreadful calamity, acquaints us also, that, as the waters subsided, the ark rested on the top of Mount Ararat. In disembarking, therefore, the first place our second progenitors must have visited was necessarily the Plain of Erivan, which spreads itself at the foot of that mountain; and I presume those who have visited this beautiful and luxuriant plain, viewing it even under all the dis advantages of an imperfect government, will allow that few places on the surface of the earth, both as to climate and production, could have been better chosen for refreshing, supporting, and gratifying the immediate wants of such a motley assemblage of storm-beaten mariners. The vine, the peach, the fig, the apricot, the melon, the water-melon, the apple, the pear, the mulberry, corn of all sorts, and the most nutritious grains, are found there now, and were not improbably permitted to start up there when the waters withdrew. I admit the Sacred Writings do not tell us what length of sojourn Noah made in this delightful plain, nor do they de clare to us that he ever left it. The 9th chapter of Genesis contains the account of Noah's debarkation from the ark; and the 20th verse of that chapter has the following remarkable words, which seem to re present the Patriarch as being desirous of taking up his abode where (if I may use the expression) he first landed:—' And Noah began to be an husband man ; and he planted a vineyard.' The first part of the 2d verse of the 9th chapter of Genesis I have always considered as very inter-xv i preliminary matter. esting:—' And it came to pass, as they journeyed ' from the East, that they found a plain in the land ' of Shinar.' The pronoun they assuredly refers only to the sons and grandsons, &amp;c. of the Patriarch; because he himself is not mentioned as one of those journeying; but, on the contrary, his death is dis closed to us in the preceding chapter, without any mention being made of his having undertaken any journey or travel whatever. It will be difficult to suppose, if the ark rested on the top of Mount Ararat, that Noah did not visit the plain at the bottom of the mountain ; unless we recur to the or^unfientuTti (id ctbsuvcluni, and suppose that he remained in the ark till he died, which we are told was 350 years after the Flood. But we are expressly informed: ' Noah went forth, and his sons, ' and his wife, and his sons' wives, with him : every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl, and ' whatsover creepeth upon the earth, after their ' kinds, went forth out of the ark.' And here I wish to submit a remark which has frequently occurred to me; which is, that whenever we find a fact of great im portance noticed in Scripture, the locale, where that fact is stated to have happened, will, if minutely exa mined, be found to be a kind of collateral testimony of its truth : as in the instance before us, the Plain ol Erivan being peculiarly adapted for the commodious reception of the Patriarch and his precious charge. I shall now transcribe the following passage from Sir John Malcolm's History of Persia; leaving every one to draw from it the inference he pleases. Sir John mentions a work called the Dabistan; which, though heretofore considered of doubtfulpreliminary matter. xvii authority, has lately received some support from the discovery of a volume in the Ancient Pelvic, called the Dussateer, or Jemarauatseer, to which the author of the Dabistan refers. I have never met with either of these works; but Sir John proceeds to tell us, that, according to the latter, ' the Ancient Persians ' deemed it impossible to ascertain who were the ' first parents of the human race :— the knowledge ' of man, they alleged, was quite incompetent to ' such a discovery. But they believed, on the ' authority of their books, that Mah-abad was the ' person left at the end of the last cycle, and, con- ' sequently, the father of the present world.' The only particulars they relate of him are, that he and his wife, having survived the former cycle, were blessed with a numerous progeny, who inhabited caves and the clefts of rocks, and were uninformed both of the comforts and luxuries of life; that they were at first strangers to order and government; but that Mah-abad, inspired and aided by the Divine Power, resolved to alter their condition; and, to effect that object, planted gardens, invented orna ments, and forged weapons. He also taught to take the fleece from sheep, to make clothing: he built cities, constructed palaces, and introduced amongst his descendants all the benefits of art and commerce. The 10th chapter of Genesis contains an account of Noah's numerous progeny, and expressly states by them the world was peopled; and proceeds, from verse the 8th to the end of the chapter, with a de tailed account of the manner, and by what parts of Noah's progeny, this was performed. Noah himself, hxv111 preliminary matter. as has before been stated, lived 350 years after the Flood. Surely it will strike every Oriental scholar, that Mah and Abad, in more ancient Oriental languages than one, will produce a compound word signifying, and capable of being translated to signify, without borrowing much from fancy, a designation and de scription of Noah easily reconcileable to those given of him in Scripture. Mah, it is presumed, will not be disputed to mean ' great,' supremus ; and Abad, either as a termination or as a substantive, means, 'peace,' 'rest,' 'security'; or the place of peace, rest, or security. Now, in the 6th chapter of Genesis, verse 17, the Almighty condescends to declare to Noah : ' And ' behold I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon ' the earth, to destroy all flesh wherein is the ' breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing ' that is on the earth shall die.' The 18th verse however opens with, ' But with thee will I establish my covenant:' by which all created things were saved from annihilation, and peace and rest restored to animated nature. In Scripture, Noah is called ' a just man, and perfect in all his generations and the meaning of the Hebrew word Noah is, in some of our Bibles, explained Comforter. It is possible the coincidences now presented may have been treated of by persons infinitely more learned than I am : of that I am ignorant: but if they have not, and any such person should con sider the imperfect hints I have given as worth notice, I shall be much gratified. I am not able toPRELIMINARY MATTER. xix pursue the investigation of them with advantage, not being at all acquainted with the Hebrew and Sanscrit, and not aware that any thing available to this research exists in such fragments, or reputed fragment, as we possess, of the Ancient Pelvic. When the arrow character made use of in the In scriptions existing at Babylon, Persepolis, and some other places, shall be accurately deciphered and translated, we may with reason expect to acquire, by such translation, most valuable historical and political information and evidence on the earliest periods of the existence of this world. The following is the account the late Sir William Jones, in his Sixth Discourse to the Asiatic Society at Calcutta, gives of the Dabistan, the work men tioned in the preceding pages: and I beg here to remark, that the whole of this Discourse is (as in deed all the rest are) particularly interesting, and worth reading. ' The rare and interesting tract on twelve diffe- ' rent religions, entitled ' The Dabistan,' and com- ' posed by a Muhammedan traveller, a native of ' Cashmir, named Mohsan, but distinguished by ' the assumed sirname of Fani, or Perishable, begins ' with a wonderful curious chapter on the religion ' of Hoshung,' the second monarch of the Paishda- dian dynasty, which was long anterior to that of ' Zera-tusht, but had continued to be secretly pro- fessed by many learned Persians, even to the ' author's time; and several of the most eminent &lt;( of them dissenting in many points from the Gabrs, 44 and persecuted by the ruling Powers of their coun- ' try, had retired to India, where they compiled a h 2XX PRELIMINARY MATTER. ' number of books, now extremely scarce; which ' Mohsan had perused, and with the writers of ' which, or with many of them, he had con- ' tracted an intimate friendship: from them he ' learned that a powerful monarchy had been esta- ' blished for ages in Iran, before the accession of ' Kaiomars, that was called the Mahabadian dynasty, ' for a reason which will soon be mentioned ; and ' that many princes, of whom seven or eight are ' only named in the Dabistan, and among them ' Mahbul, or Maha Beli, had raised their empire to the zenith of human glory. If we can rely on ' this evidence, which appears to me unexception- ' able, the Iranian monarchy must have been the ' oldest in the world; but it will remain doubtful to ' which of the three stocks, Hindu, Arabian, or ' Tartar, the first kings of Iran belonged, or whe- ' ther they sprang from a fourth race distinct from ' any of the others ; and these are questions which ' we shall be able, I imagine, to answer precisely, ' when we have looked carefully into the languages ' and letters, religion and philosophy, and inciden- ' tally into the arts and sciences of the Ancient ' Persians.' It must not be passed over, that after a great deal of very learned reasoning on the subject of the Mahabadian dynasty. Sir William, at the end of the Discourse, appears to come, though from different premises, to pretty near the same conclusion that I have hinted at in the fourth paragraph of these preliminary pages. 'We may therefore hold this proposition firmly ' established, that Iran, or Persia, in its largestPRELIMINARY MATTER. XXI ' sense, was the true centre of population, of know- ' ledge, of languages, and of Arts; which, instead of ' travelling westward only, as it has been fancifully ' supposed ; or eastward, as might with equal rea- ' son have been asserted; were expanded in all ' directions, to all the regions of the world.' ' It is to be observed,' Sir John Malcolm remarks, in a note, ' the similarity to this name (of Mahbul ' or Mah Beli) to the Belus of the Egyptians, and ' to the Mahbali, or the great Bali, of the Hindus, ' will strike every learned reader.' We are told, Belus, or Amenophis, king of Egypt, began to reign An. Mun. 2494, or Ant. J.C.1500; and Moreri, Grand Die. under the article Belus, remarks as follows: ' Nos auteurs modernes out une autre id^e de Belus: ' ils le prennent, apres plusieurs pferes, pour le Nem- ' broth de I'^criture : ce qu'on peut croire, pourvu ' qu'on ne la fasse pas fondateur du grand empire ' d'Assyrie, qui est bien plus recent.' Turning to Scripture, we find, in the 10th chapter of Genesis, that Cush begat Nimrod; and that Cush was the son of Ham, who was the son of Noah. In verses 9 and 10 of the same chapter, Nimrod is men tioned as being a mighty hunter before the Lord; and the beginning of his kingdom was Babel.' It is true, however, that Sir John Malcolm (ac cording, I suppose, to the Dabistan) makes Mahbul the third prince of the Jyanian dynasty. The author in the Encyclopaedia Britannica of the article Nimrod, says, 'Authors have taken a great deal ' ot pains to find Nimrod in Profane History : some ' have imagined him to be the same with Belus, the ' founder of the Babylonish Empire: others take himxxii PRELIMINARY MATTER. ' to be the same as Ninus, the first Assyrian mon- ' arch. Some believe him to have been Evechous, ' the firstChaldean king after the Deluge; and others perceive a gi'eat resemblance between him and ' Bacchus, both in actions and in name. Some of ' the Muhammedan writers suppose Nimrod to have ' been Zohak, a Persian king of the second dynasty: ' others contend for his being Kay Kaus, the second ' king of the second race ; and some of the Jews say ' he is the same as Amphrael, the king of Shinar, mentioned by Moses. But there is no certainty ' in these conjectures, nor have we any knowledge ' of his immediate successors.' With this last very sensible remark, I hasten to relieve the reader from a subject on which perhaps he thinks more than enough has already been thrown out, unless I had been deeper read, or had better data to offer to his notice. I will however just remark, that there is a difference in the account of Zohak, as given by Sir John Malcolm, and the compiler of the Encyclopaedia Britannica. The latter says, Zohak was a Persian king of the first dynasty : the former, that Zohak was a Syrian prince, encouraged by the impiety of Jamshid, the fourth prince of the Paish- dadian dynasty, to invade Persia, which he subdued; and caused Jamshid, who fell into his hands, to be placed between two boards, which he afterwards ordered to be sawn asunder. It is to be observed, that the authority Sir John quotes on this occasion is the Zenat-el-tavarik, a history compiled, or rather written, by a Muhammedan ; on whom I cannot feel very willing to place much faith, seeing, in general, how the Muhammedan historians distort facts, con-PRELIMINARY MATTER.

But if I am little in- id clined to consider the Muhammedan historians, of of the times before the appearance of their Prophet, ve as worthy of much credit, it becomes me to add, y. that, in nine cases out of ten, I believe any system ud founded purely on etymology is entitled to less. a y In such speculations, I am well aware how reason irj limps and imagination flies: at the same time I must ty be allowed to add, that, in respect to the Mosaical g e history, I entirely agree with a very learned writer, who says, ' There is no medium or palliation : the whole is allegorical, or the whole is literalor, in p S other words, the whole is true, or the whole is false. vn SECT. II. ter ^ It may not perhaps be disagreeable to the reader as to find some little account of the different dynas- l ie ties which have reigned, or are said to have reigned, over Persia: not that I shall so far exercise his pa- tience as to attempt to reconcile the accounts of j ie any of these monarchs given us by the Eastern writers, either with Sacred History, or with the his- ^, torical accounts we have received of different ^ Persian princes from the Greek or Roman histo- rds Yians. Those who are desirous of receiving infor- mation on this subject will find a great variety of books which may be consulted; and amongst the icr res ^ ^^ 0 ^ ume of Sir John Malcolm's History ee [ 0 f Persia, a work which displays no common labour al researc ^ an( i offers, amidst a good deal of con- jecture (as must infallibly happen in this case), axxiv preliminary matter. great deal of information. For my own part, in respect to the Greek historians, the opinion I formed many years ago, on reading the incomparable Dis sertation which Mr. Richardson has prefixed to his Persian Dictionary, has never been weakened, by subsequent reading, reflection, or the degree of ac quaintance I have made with the Arabic and Persian languages. Speaking of the Greek writers, Mr. Richardson observes: 'We have names of Persian ' kings which a Persian could not pronounce : we *&lt; have facts related they apparently never knew: ' and we have customs attributed to them which ' contradict every distinguishing character of an *' Eastern people.' To the first of these remarks it may be answered: If the Greeks found the Persian names difficult of pronunciation, they would change the orthography of them in such wise as would faci litate their utterance of them; of which any one may easily be convinced, if he will look into the Byzan tine historians, particularly Anna Commena, and observe how she alters the European names of several of the Crusaders, of whom she has occasion to speak. To the second it may be replied, the his tory of no tw r o hostile nations contains an exact enumeration of the same facts as regarding both; nor does it afford precisely the same account of even an important fact in which both have been in terested, and both have been actors. But the last remarks of Mr. Richardson's (if admitted) I con sider, with submission, conclusive; nor can my mind furnish me with an argument to weaken the force of them. Whoever imagines time produces the same changePllELIMINAKY MATTER. XXV in the manners and customs of the inhabitants of Eastern countries as it does in those of the inhabi tants of Europe, has not been fortunate enough to have had much intercourse with the East, or to be much interested in its ancient or modern history. I could easily load my page with instances and quo tations, proving in how small, how very small de gree, time has, in this respect, marked a trace of its passage on the Arabs; and I persuade myself I could even prove, where the religion of a country has been changed by the sword, that customs long established, and long revered under a former system of public worship, will, on some occasions, and at particular periods, be resorted to, in spite of con quest and intolerance :—witness the celebration of the Nurooz in Persia. The reader, no doubt, will rejoice to be spared a return to the Mahabadian dynasty ; which, accord ing to the Dabistan, was succeeded by that of the Jyanians; which dynasty, according to a Pelvic work alluded to by Sir John Malcolm, lasted one aspar, which is computed to be a thousand million of years; which, as Sir John most justly observes, ' is so far beyond all bounds of credibility, that it u would appear more like calculations applicable to ' the revolutions of the heavenly bodies, than real ' history.' The list of Paishdadian Princes, given by various Persian historians, is as follows: Kaiomars, reigned Hoshung . . Jahamurz . 30 years 40 .. 30 .. Jamshid . . . . 700 Zchak .... 1900 ..

To this dynasty Sir William Jones has very properly applied the epithet ' Fabulous.' The names of the second, or Kaianian dynasty, is offered to us by the same authoiities, in the lol- lowing order: Kai Kobad, reigned 100 years KaiKaus . . .150 .. Kai Khosrou. . . 60 ..

Sir William Jones has marked this dynasty by the epithet ' Poetical.' To the third dynasty has been appropriated the name of Mulook-ul-Towayef; which I consider as meaning ' an empire split into provinces,' each of which is seized on by some powerful nobleman or chief of a tribe, and each sustaining his government independent of the other. Of this period of Persian History, Sir John Malcolm remarks: ' The ac- ' counts we receive from Persian writers are vague ' and contradictory : they have evidently no mate- ' rials to form an accurate narrative ; and it is too ' near the date at which their real history com- ' mences to admit of their indulgence in fable!' The learned and industrious D'Herbelot, speaking of this period, says, ' Cet endroit est le plus em-preliminary matter. xxvll To ' barrass6 et le plus obscur de toute I'histoire de srly ' Perse.' Sir William Ouseley, however, is of opinion, that it is possible, by a minute examination sty, of Greek and Latin writers, to reconcile the various fol- traditions with historical and chronological truth. May I be permitted, without giving offence, to ex press a doubt, whether, if this were effected (which ear3 I imagine that learned and indefatigable scholar and antiquarian would find more difficult than he seems to conceive), may I be allowed, I say, to doubt whether the discovery would be worth the labour. The princes of this dynasty are ranged under 0 P' the Ashkanians and Ashganians; and the time of ^ their reign is supposed to have occupied 318 years; ? 01 ^ that is, the first to have reigned 165, and the second llter 153 years. itly, \V e now arrive at the Sassanian dynasty, which ( at Sir William Jones considers as entitled to be called mm Historical. According to Sir William Ouseley, this dynasty commenced a. d . 125, and ended in the person of Yezdejerid II., a. d . 652. Sir William and the D'Herbelot have both given a list of the names r as of the Sassanian Princes, in which there is a trifling h ol difference; D'Herbelot making them twenty-nine, 11 or and Sir William twenty-eight; though the latter lent mentions, in the opening of his chapter of this sian dynasty, that thirty-one kings of the line of Sassan ac- reigned. I presume this to have been an error of igue the press. ate- I will not trouble my Reader with an enumera- too tion of the names of the princes of this line, parti- om- cularly as there are many of them to whose reigns I could not affix a date that would either satisfy ting em-preliminary ma 1 ier. him or myself. Those who may be desiious ol minutely and critically comparing and examining lik( the accounts left us by the Eastern and Western historians of the wars, transactions, and intercourse ^ between these princes and the contemporary States of Europe may find a very curious list of Oriental ^ authors given by Sir William Ouseley; whilst the Scriptures, the Greek and Roman writers, the early W01 Fathers, and some pages of the Decline and F all of ^ the Roman Empire, may be referred to, as abound- wh ing with information on these subjects. p e As one of the causes of the extinction of the ^ Sassanian Government in Persia, I cannot avoid wa ; mentioning, that the birth ot Muhammed, at onct n0 | the Prophet and Legislator of the Arabs, took place coi under the reign of Nousheerevan. According to Ockley, this happened about a. d . 571; who adds, ' Historians do not agree about the precise year. (( ^ If, however, we may believe one of the gravest j ^ of the Arabian historians, signs and prodigies tool j place in Persia at the birth ot this extraordinar) C01 personage, quite sufficient to portend the extent g ci and fatality of ruin destined to descend on that wa country. # of 1st, The palace of Khosrou, the king ot Persia, en( was so shaken, that fourteen towers thereof fell to the ground. 2dly, which if true could not fail ot being more awful to the Persians, The sacred fiif) which had been kept incessantly burning for 1000 p 0 , years, went out all at once. 3dly, The Lake Sawa j s sunk ; and 4thly, The Tigris overflowed its banks. e - t Khosrou is stated to have been so alarmed by these p 0 prodigies, and by a dream oi the High Priest ol SlrPRELIMINARY MATTER. xxix Persia, which seemed to forebode a calamity as likely to take place from Arabia, that he sent for a famous diviner, to inquire of him what these pro digies might portend. The answer reported to have been given is, ' That fourteen kings and queens of Persia should reign in successionand that, afterwards, ' That which was to come to pass would happen.' This is perfectly oracular! Besides these prodigies, the consequences of which might be considered as only relating to Persia, it was pretended, much on the same autho rity, that when Muhammed came into the world he was surrounded by a bright light, which illuminated not only the chamber where he lay, but the whole country round; and that as soon as he was born, he fell on his knees, and distinctly pronounced, in Arabic, the Muhammedan profession of faith, i. e. ' God is great, there is no other God but God, and I (Muhammed) am His Prophet.' It is clear that Muhammed, in composing and compiling the Koran, made free use of the Holy Scriptures; and as the real Mission of our Lord was accompanied by real miracles, so the followers of the Arabian Prophet are consistent enough in endeavouring to establish his pretended mission by pretended miracles. I am not aware, that, in any one instance, Mu hammed assumed to himself, in the Koran, the power of working miracles : the splitting the moon is so equivocally mentioned, that it may be taken either for an act of Muhammed's, or of the divine power: this is just the manner in which one would suppose a person in Muhammed's situation wouldXXX PRELIMINARY MATTER. mention such an occurrence. But what is curious bai is, that the genius and idiom of the Arabic language P 0 is such, that bulky Commentaries have been written, by learned Muhammedan divines, on both sides 01 a ^ v this most momentous question. to( Muhammed, indeed, was more than once called ^ e! on, by the faithless, ' to give them a sign and ii the 13th chapter of the Koran, the text on this sub- a P] ject is so closely copied from the Gospel, that 1 se( conceive every one must see from whence it is un borrowed.

In this battle the fate of Persia CC ' was determined. It is reported to have con- (,t tinned for three days, and a part of the fourth. The Persian troops amounted, according to the Arabian historians, to 130,000: their own, at the commencement of the engagement, to 30,000: the former commanded by Rustam Ferookhzad, the i hp chief Minister of Yezdejerid; and the latter by Saad Ibn-abou Wekaus, who, however, from an at- clC tack of sciatica, was prevented from taking a per- ^ sonal share in the combat. He conferred the com mand on Khaled. The account Ockley affords of this memorablePRELIMINARY MATTER. xxxi battle is brief and abrupt. At this period of their power the Arabs had a custom of giving names to the battles in which they were engaged; which names always alluded to some particular circumstance which took place in the course of the conflict. Thus at Ca- desia, on the first day, the combatants were engaged from morn till sunset; and the battle obtained the appellation of ' The Day of Concussion.' On the second day the Arabs received a reinforcement, under Kaukia Ibn Amru, from Syria; and hence it was called The Day of Assistance.' On the third, the combat was continued from the morning to the hour of noon-day prayer; at which time a most violent whirlwind is said to have arisen, setting directly in the face of the Persians, and thereby contributing to their defeat. To this part of the battle was given the name of ' The Day of Cormo rants and to the struggle which continued through the night, that of ' The Night of Snarling.' It seems the Arabs, even on the third day, re ceived a fresh supply of men, under the command of Hashem Ibn Allebeh ; and the Arabian historians relate that the battle, during the night, was carried on, on each side, by the light of torches. Rustam, the Persian general-in-chief, fell on the fourth morning; and the manner of his death is variously related. The loss of the Persians is said to have been 100,000, whilst that of the Arabs is not carried beyond 7 or 8000: but we collect, even from the account given by the Arabs themselves, that the Persians fought bravely, in defence of their religion and country ; that if they were superior in numbers at the commencement of the battle, the Arabs onxxxii PRELIMINARY MATTER. each day had the advantage of being joined by fresli ol reinforcements; and that the battle, at last, was or probably decided by the accident of the whirlwind. sti The enumeration as well as the quality of the na plunder which fell into the hands of the Arabs, aftei ris the victory, cannot but remind us of what Quintus dis Curtius relates of that which, after the battle oi ass Issus, fell into those of Alexander : ' Sed jam ills thi ' quoque hostis victor intraverat omni quidem opu- sta ' lentia ditia.

Conquest is invariably attended by circumstances sufficiently painful to the vanquished and to huma nity ; but in the case of that of Persia by the Arabs, there is reason to believe the common and usual miseries of it were much aggravated; as will always happen, when the conquered are further advanced in arts and civilization than their conquerors. Be sides this, the Arabs strictly applied to their new subjects the rule both of their faith and warfare; that is, either the abandonment of their old system of religion for the reveries of Muhammed, or the redemption of their lives by the payment of a capi tation-tax, and the loss of their most valuable poli tical privileges. We may suppose, too, that the fanatic Arab might grant his protection on easier terms to his Christian enemy, than to him who was a worshipper of fire ; inasmuch as he would consider the first, from acknowledging the Divine or at least the Piophetic character of our Saviour, (whom his own Prophet had styled ' Roh ullah,' or The Spirit of God,) as approaching nearer to Islam, than him who palpably appeared a rank idolater: for it is not very likely that the Arab, with the fire-altar before his eyes, would patiently listen to the Persian priest, when he attempted to explain the symbolic mysteries of the doctrines of Zoroaster; or that, if id listen to him, he would comprehend and mit the truth of dogmas so little suited to his taste an t c style of his religious reasoning. c 2xxxvi preliminary matter.

The manner of his obtaining the com mand and government of the Persian provinces from the Caliph Mansoor will be related in the Notes, as well as some account given of his descendants: their power, after having enjoyed it for the space of fifty-four years, being put an end to, in the year of the Hejira 251, by Yacoob-ibn-Lais-el-SufFar. Suffar, in Persian and Arabic, means ' Copper smith which trade Lais, the father of Yacoob, fol lowed : and from this circumstance his descendants are known by the appellation of Suffarian. Yacoob, as early as the year of the Hejira 249, had com menced a successful revolt against the caliph's go vernment in Persia; and in the year of the Hejira 255, had become so formidable, that the Caliph Muatten Billah found it necessary formally to ac knowledge him: and the usurper shortly after this marched towards Bagdad, with the design of de throning the caliph ; but he met with a signal defeat, from the Bagdad troops under the command of the caliph's brother, Mouffek. On this, he retired to Khorasan, levied a fresh army, prepared for another attempt against the caliph; but died on his march, a.h. 264. Ihe power he had obtained, however, passed to his descendants; and they continued to annoy the caliphat so greatly, that Muatten Billah, the six teenth caliph of the House of Abbas, employed Ismail, of the race of Saman, Prince of Bokhara, to defeat and destroy them.

To the Samanian Princes succeeded Sultan Mah- mud Ghaznavi, the son of Subbuctageen Beg, who had seized on, or who had been raised to, the go vernment of the Principality of Ghazna; and on whom the Caliph U1 Khauder bestowed the lofty sounding titles of Yemeen-ud-dowlah, and Ameen- ul-Millut; that is, ' the Right Hand of State, and the Protector of the Faith of Muhammed.' It was under the reign, and at one time under the favour and protection, of this great prince, that the cele brated Persian poet, Ferdousi, composed the ' Shah Nameh;' and it was afterwards against this prince that he composed one of the bitterest satires that ever was levelled against royalty. I ought not finally to dismiss the Deylemite princes without remarking, that they were persons whose name, at the present day, is deservedly held in high estimation in those parts of Asia which were sub jected to their rule; and that for magnificence, learning, and protection of the Arts, they may not unaptly be compared to some of the Princes of the House ot Medici.

It seems to have been a custom siab, with many of the Seljukian Sultans to commit the It care and education of their children, residing in dif- that ferent parts of their empire, to their great Ameers and or Lords; and these Ameers were from thence Khar styled Attabegs. the \ It will easily be understood, that these powerful yean noblemen, assisted by time and circumstances, were accoi enabled to assume, where they were established, the const sovereign power.

She pre sided at Shiraz to the day of her death, a.h. 686 ; after which, no claimant of the race of Selgher ap peared for the dominions ruled by this princess. The Luristan Attabegs were frequently called Hazaraspides, and had for their founder a person named Abu Taher: and their power ended in Afra- siab, the eighth prince of his race. It was some time in the year of the Hejira 615 that the greatest, but at the same time the cruellest and most barbarous of all conquerors, Jengheez Khan, put his countless myriads in motion towards the West: and we are told, that in the space of six years, either by himself or his generals, he entirely accomplished the subversion of every thing that constituted the strength and the glory of the Per sian empire. From the year of the Hejira 621, therefore, to the year 748, or a.d . 1247, Persia was ruled by princes descended from Jengheez Khan, distinguished by the appellation of Perso-Jengheezian. It should not be omitted, that, in the year 654 of the Hejira, Halakou Khan, the scourge of the East, extermi nated the detestable sect of the Ismailians, known in Europe under the name of Assassins. On the ruin of these sprang up that of Eylkhau- nian sovereigns; so called from Shaikh Husain Bazurg, or Shaikh Husain the Great, Eylkhaunee. The last monarch of this family was Ahmed Sultan; who was put to death at Tauris, in the year of the Hejira 812. It was during the reign of this prince, a.d. 1384,xlii preliminary matter. that the Mogul Tartars, under the sanguinary Timur, again made irruption into Western Asia one of the consequences of which, at some distance of time, was the elevation to the throne of Persia oi Ismail the son of Shaikh Shafia, who had establishcc himself at Ardabil. Timur died of a fever, at Otrai on the 18th of February 1405; after having, in the space of twenty-one years, during which he was al most uniformly at the head of his troops in the field brought under his subjection the greater part of Asia, and consequently the whole of Persia; and leaving to his descendants an empire little short, in point cl extent, to that possessed by Jengheez Khan. Shah Rokh, the fourth of his sons, succeeded hii father, though not without a struggle, in the govern ment of Persia and many of the neighbouring States and he is described, by the Oriental Historians, as a person most humane in disposition, possessed o; many fine qualities, and of an excellent understand ing. He died at Facharoud, near Rai, on the 20tl of March 1547, and was buried in that city. This excellent prince was succeeded by his son, OlugBeg, a name which to this day has remained deal to science; and which Astronomy stills ranks higl amongst her most fervent if not her most successiii students. It is painful to perceive, that the pursuit of and addiction to science sometimes leads to crime, as was the case of Olug Beg. He had no only satisfied himself that he could read his fate n the stars, but that he read that his fate was, thai he was to be dethroned and put to death by his eldest son, Abdul Latif: with this fancy in his head, he gave Abdul Latif reason to perceive that he wa?preliminary matter. xliii determined to put him out of the way. To prevent this, Abdul Latif raised a force to oppose his father, took him prisoner, and then delivered him into the hands of one of his officers whom the king had for merly ordered to be put to death. In such custody, it is not difficult to guess what became of Olug Beg; whose death, I incline to think, must have been more owing to a suspicious temper, than the malig nant influence of the stars. It took place in 1449. In addition to the blood of his father, the guilty Abdul Latif had to answer for that of his brother, Abdul-aziz. But Heaven, which sometimes, for pur poses unknown to us, winks at the commission of crimes, seldom or ever shuts its eyes to them alto gether ; and this prince was punished for those he had committed, by the loss of his sceptre and life, in the year 1450. To him succeeded his brother-in-law, Abdallah: whose reign was very short; as he lost his life in 1451, in a battle with his relation, Abu Said, de scended from Tamerlane, through Miran Shah. Hasan Beg the Turkoman, surnamed Il-tooel, or ' the Long,' and better known in Europe under the name of Ussan Cassan, had now made himself master of Azarba'ijan and Irak. He died at Tauris, in the year of the Hejira 882, or a.d . 1477. After him, his son Khelul held the government for six months, when he fell in battle against his brother, \ acoob Beg, who appears to have been a prince of considerable ability. He was induced to afford the Prince of Georgia assistance against Shaikh Haidar, the father of Shah Ismail; in which contest Haidar lost his life; and, what is singular enough, consideringxliv preliminary matter. what afterwards happened, his sons, Aly Mirza and Ismail, were taken prisoners. Yacoob is supposed to have been poisoned at Tauris, in the year of the Hejira 896 ( a. d . 1490). He was succeeded by his son, Bisancoor; who was stripped of his domi nions, by his father's former prisoner, Ismail, the son of Haidar. I have already stated, that the irruption of Timur into Western Asia was one of the causes of the future elevation of Ismail Seffee to the throne of Persia. This monarch's ancestor, Shaikh Seffee, resided in those days at Ardabil; and was not only acknow ledged to be directly descended from the Caliph Aly, by Fatima the daughter of Muhammed, but was held in the highest veneration for his peculiar sanctity of conduct. Timur entertained for him a prodigious venera tion and respect: and on his return out of Asia Minor, he dragged in chains a great number of prisoners, whom he had made in his wars with Bajazet, and whom he had resolved to put to death. In the course of his route, he visited Shaikh Seffee at Ardabil. At this interview, the proud conqueror prevailed on the Shaikh to accept a gift from him. Seffee humanely, and perhaps politically, asked that the lives of these prisoners might be spared. The request was granted; and the gratitude of the prisoners was equal to the benefit they had received: they made frequent visits afterwards, in bodies, to Ardabil: they carried to their liberator gifts of much value; and they promised, and performed, future service and devotion to the Shaikh and his family. By means of their descendants, Ismail, the descen-PRELIMINARY MATTER. xlv nd dant of Seffee, was enabled to seat himself on the ed throne of Persia. of The period which has now briefly passed under by review presents considerable difficulties, to any one ni- who attempts to abridge its history, or to reduce an he account of the different potentates and dynasties which appear on the stage, to a regular chronologi- iur cal order. ire I am willing to admit, that the sketch I have given lia. of the different persons and families to whose lot in the government of Persia and its provinces fell, from w- the time of its conquest by the Muhammedans under ph the Caliph Omar, to the commencement of the reign mt of Shah Sultan Ismail SefFee, is hasty and imperfect, iar I must be permitted to say, however, that such a sketch only came within the scheme I proposed to :a- myself in this volume; which was, to present the sia reader with an outline of the Muhammedan Rulers of of Persia, as might introduce that portion of their [th history which is now offered in translation.

THE SEFFEE DYNASTY. We now arrive at a race of Princes, who, accord ing to any notions we entertain of good govern ment, morality, or decency, have as little claim to our respect as the most despicable set of despots, vil- lains, and profligates, presented to us in any History whatever, and whose actions fully justify the spirited description of their character given by the late Sir William Jones. The founder of this dynasty was Ismail Seffee or Sofy, whose genealogy, true or false, is generally set forth as follows. Ismail, the son of Shaikii Hyder, the son of Sultan Juneid, the son of Shaikh Ibrahim, the son of Shaikh Aly, the son of Shaikh Musa, the son of Shaikh Seffee, who was esteemed to be the 13th in descent, in a right line, from Aly, the son-in-law of Muhammed. The princes of this House commenced to reign over Persia in the person of Ismail, about the year a. d . 1500; and ended in an infant in his cradle, set up by Tahmasp Kooly Khan, afterwards Nadir Shah, under the name of Abbas III. a. d . 1733; making a period of some thing like 233 years. That the atrocities they committed should so long have been borne by the Persians, I can only explain, by imagining that the Persians considered the direct descent they claimed from the Family of the Prophet to be true andPRELIMINARY MATTER. xlvii correct: and indeed it frequently happened, when I conversed with intelligent natives, to whom I ex pressed a free opinion on this subject, that I have heard from them in reply: 'Aye; but consider ' from whom they were descended, and what they ' did to establish and support the true and holy ' faith,' i, e. the Shiah. I will not trouble the reader with a detail of Ismail's successive victories over the Governors or Princes of different Persian provinces; nor will I exercise his patience to read a catalogue of uncouth names, belonging to persons whose celebrity and importance was confined to a very limited space. It is enough to mention, that during the twenty- four years which Ismail reigned, he had the good fortune to reduce to his obedience the greater and certainly the richer part of what we are accustomed to consider the Persian empire: though it seems not improbable, that if Selim I., after the battle of Khoie, between the Turks and the Persians, which ended so unfortunately for the latter, had not been tempted to turn his arms against Egypt (considering it as the richer prize), the dynasty of Seffee might have begun and ended in the person of Ismail. The character of Ismail, as given by historians, is pretty much the same as generally belongs to men of his class ;—courage, blemished with a total absence of all humane feeling; political acuteness, little careful of what means it employed to ensure success ; a complete and thorough perception of the advantages arising from exact and severe military discipline ; and an unbounded ambition;—which last will easily be believed, if the saying reported as his be true: 'As there is but one God inxlviii PRELIMINARY MATTER. ' heaven, so there ought to be but one king on ' earth.' He died in 1523, and was succeeded by his eldest son, * SHAH TAHMASP. On the death of Ismail, the tranquillity of several parts of his dominions was disturbed by an irruption of the Uzbeg Tartars; but the most formidable enemy the new monarch had to oppose, was Sulei man, emperor of the Turks, surnamed The Magni ficent. Suleiman penetrated Persia, with a great force, as far as Tauris, the capital of the province of Azarba'ijan ; which city he took, and sacked, in a most relentless manner. He afterwards proceeded to Sultaniyah; and whilst encamped on that beau tiful plain, his army experienced a storm so dreadful, that no parallel to it is mentioned in Persian History: he then withdrew from Persia, and took up his quarters at Diarbekr, leaving behind him 17,000 men, as a sort of rear-guard. Tahmasp attacked and defeated this body of troops, and then recaptured Tauris. To prevent the future incur sions of the Turks, the Persian monarch adopted a measure, of all others the most distressing to a humane prince : he devastated, for many leagues, the Persian frontier towards Turkey. Ismail had reduced Georgia to the condition ot a tributary State ; and Tahmasp, taking advantage of % the dissension between the sons of Luarzab, prince of Karduel, or Eastern Georgia, on their fathers death contrived to get both these princes into bis power. The elder he confined in a fortress near the Caspian, whilst he artfully prevailed on David, the younger, to change his religion. This done, bePRELIMINARY MATTER. xlix i 011 obliged the different Georgian chiefs to deliver to ^ b y him hostages for their fidelity; and the renegade David was sent to govern Georgia, under the Shah, with the dignity and appellation of Daoud Khan.

This fine scheme, as far as respected ook the death of the Shah, was prevented by the him management of the elder sister, the Princess Peri; lasp and Hyder, instead of mounting a throne, had his hen head chopped off, by his maternal uncle, Shamal, a ;ur- Georgian by birth, ;d a 0 a ISMAIL II. jes, At the time of his father's death, as has already been mentioned, Ismail II. was a state prisoner in rjf a the Castle of Kahak, from whence, by the Princess e of Peri's means, he was released to ascend the throne, nce Asiatic monarchies there is but one species of er's reward reserved for such as are pre-eminently instru- his mental in the elevation of a sovereign ; and that is, iear death. But whether the Princess Peri received this /id, reward from her brother Ismail, or from her brother .he dI PRELIMINARY MATTER. MuhammedKhoda-bendeh,is not quite certain. One tale is, that the first act of Ismail's reign was Peri's destruction; but the English traveller, Herbert, makes this lady, whom he dignifies with the appel lation of virago, murder her brother Ismail, whose reign, at all events, did not extend beyond the period of a few months, a space long enough, however, for him to convince the world, by cruelty and by the practice of every abominable vice, that he was a true SefFee. One account tells us, that he lost his life by swallowing poison in treacle, of which he was very fond; the other, that he was assassi nated in his harem by conspirators, tutored by the Princess Peri, who gained admittance under the dis guise of women whom he expected to receive. MUHAMMED KHODA-BENDEH. Muhammed, at the time his brother Ismail was taken from this world, was in Khorasan, and, on receiving notice of what had happened, proceeded to Kazwin, at which place he took possession of the government, and ascended the throne of Persia. Herbert, as I have already quoted, tells us that the first act of Muhammed's reign was an order for the death of his sister Peri; and that the execution of it was entrusted to Mirza Almas, general of horse, who brought to his sovereign the head of his sister fixed on the point of a spear,with her long curling hair dangling downat the sight of which, my author quaintly continues, Muhammed was as much alarmed as if he had seen the head of Medusa.' This lady, in addition to her other various accom plishments, is said to have had an indiscriminate lovePRELIMINARY MATTER. li ot gallantry, and is accused of forming a plan to raise one of her sweethearts to the throne ; so that, between political intrigue on the one hand, and no very decent amorous propensities on the other, she appears to have fully merited the fate she met with. Like that of many other sovereigns, the character of Muhammed Khoda-bendeh is given differently. Some historians represent him as wisely employing his time for the benefit of the State ; whilst others leport him to have passed it in gambling, and the society of his women. There is little reason to doubt that the Turks on one side, and the Uzbeg Tartais on the other, invaded Persia during his reign; that they seized on several provinces ; and that they retained them as long as Muhammed lived. Accidents of this sort speak little in praise of the monarch, and afford no credible proof of his time being spent for the benefit of the State. Georgia, on the death of Tahmasp, threw off the yoke he had imposed on her. An army was sent to reduce her to obedience. Daoud Khan fled ; and nis elder brother, who, it has already been related, was confined in a prison on the shore of the Caspian ^ea, recollecting how that prince had obtained the government of Georgia, resolved to repeat the game. e changed his faith, and was in consequence sent as Governor to Teflis, under the Muhammedan ap pellation of Simon Khan. Christianity, at this time, sat very easily on the inhabitants of Georgia. In- dest, lust, or ambition, were considered by them 0 e tolerable good reasons for abandoning their 1 1 &gt; foi submitting to the painful operation of cir- Cl iiTicision; and for acknowledging the foolish, ill- d 2lii preliminary matter. contrived, and inconsistent reveries of an impostor, built on the connected relation by inspired histo rians of the Deity's Commands and Revelation to His creatures. In the present day, perhaps, when the sovereign of that country is a Christian, the Georgians may think it more decent, and may find it more advantageous, to keep themselves a little straiter-laced. Muhammed Khoda-bendeh died a. d . 1584; having reigned about seven years; and leaving behind him three sons—Hamzeh, Ismail, and Abbas. He w succeeded by the eldest of them, HAMZEH. This prince, during his father's lifetime, had dis tinguished himself so much with the army, that hi flatterers bestowed on him the title of ' Wonde: of the Ageand as a very pretty practical proo how well he deserved it, we have to relate, that if the short space of eight months after his accessioi to the throne, he allowed his brother Ismail to fom a conspiracy against him, which cost him his life.

Ismail III. immediately succeeded to the throne. Abbas Mirza, to whom his brother Hamzeh had confided the government of Khorasan, under the tutelage of Moorshid Kooly Khan, had left Herat, then the capital of the province, to visit his deceased brother. But on hearing what had happened to him. Abbas, or his counsellor, judged it more prudent to return to Herat, than proceed on their journey. This open mark of suspicion offended Ismail; though, considering what had lately happened to Hamzeh, it was not very likely that Abbas would trust himself in his brother's power. This state of things could not last long without a crisis; and Moorshid found no difficulty in making his pupil understand, that if he wished to enjoy life and fortune, he must rid the world of his fratricide brother. The plan Moorshid, or Abbas, adopted for this purpose, was to bribe Ismail's barber to cut his throat whilst shaving him; which, if true, and the barber escaped punishment, is strong evidence how much Ismail must have been detested by his own servants, or low well the plans of the conspirators were arranged. A person now comes on the stage of Persian History, whose name has acquired some celebrity. ABBAS I. SURNAMED BY THE PERSIANS, ' THE GREAT.' In the relation of his life and reign, which I shall go into something more at length than I have done with those of the preceding princes of his family he reader w.U find a sufficiency of circumstances to enable h.m to judge how far this detestableliv preliminary matter. tyrant deserved the name of ' Great,' as applied in any good sense of the word. There can be no doubt that Moorshid was highly instrumental in procuring the empire for his pupil; and being so, he was soon destined to experience the truth of the remark already made, that in Asia it is always dangerous to be too useful to one 'i sovereign. Whether Moorshid presumed too fai on the services he had rendered his master, o: whether that master considered that he who hac proved himself so potent a friend might hereafter should he so incline, become as potent an enemy cannot now be ascertained ; but Abbas determined that Moorshid should die ;—and the story how tha: determination was effected, is worth relating. The resolution the king had come to on thi subject he imparted to three lords of his court, wb imagined, at first, that a thing which appearec so little to be expected was communicated to then for some sinister purpose. They therefore ai tempted to dissuade the Shah from his purpose but he continuing to tell them it was his pleasitf that Moorshid should receive his death from thet hands, and that if they persisted in refusing to gi* him this mark of their obedience he would &amp; means to make them obey, they perceived tha Moorshid's doom was fixed; and they then con sented to execute what the Shah required of then The king led them to the chamber of the forntf favourite; where they found Moorshid lying asleep on his back. Abbas first struck him with sword, on the mouth ; when the others also wound* him; but Moorshid, being a very powerful man, g (mm PRELIMINARV MATTER. Iv on his legs, made a resolute resistance, and would, probably, have dealt death to some of his murderers, had not one of his grooms, hearing a scuffle in his master's chamber, entered with a battle-axe in his hand. To this man the king addressed orders, threats, and promises, in consequence of which the villain struck his master down. The Minister's death was the next day followed by that of all his relations and friends. The base groom was elevated to the rank of Khan ; and the government of Herat, which Abbas had formerly filled himself, was con ferred on a scoundrel, whose only claim to such a post was that of being the assassin of his master! Abbas's fame as a warrior has never been called in question ; for he was a right stern one—severe and cruel. He made early efforts to reconquer the provinces and places which, under some of his pre decessors, had been wrested from Persia by the Turks and Uzbeg Tartars. Against the latter, after three years perseverance, he was eminently successful; for he captured their Khan Abdallah, three of his sons, and their uncle, Abdallah's bro ther, all of whose heads Abbas made no scruple to take off. It was on his return from this successful expedi tion, that, delighted with the situation of Isfahan, and the fertility and beauty of the plain in which it stands, he resolved to make that city the capital of his kingdom. It was then also that, by a stratagem which does his ingenuity some credit, he recovered Tauris from the Turks; a piece of success which encouraged him to pursue the garrison and other lurkish troops who had fled to Nakhshivan, whichIvi preliminary matter. they did not wait the Shah's arrival, but continued their flight to Erivan, which Abbas got possession of, after a siege of nine months. The Shah, whilst employed in these transactions, particularly in an unsuccessful attempt he made to besiege Urumia, discovered how much injury the Kurds were capable oi doing him. 1 he Kurds, 10b- bers and plunderers by profession and choice, had joined the Turks in the defence of this city, in conse- quence of being well paid tor their assistance. Abbas found means to open a communication with their chiefs, to whom he promised, if the city fell into his hands, the entire plunder ot it. This line these rapacious semi -savages could not withstand they did desert the Turks; they did join Abbas against them; the city did fall into the king s hands; and the Kurds were allowed the entire plunder of it. But Abbas never designed so to part with his new allies. He invited them to a splendid banquet, prepared in a magnificent tent; in a part of which two execu tioners were concealed, who despatched the guests, one by one, as they entered. This is a sort of royal tragedy, which has been so often periormec in various parts of the world, that one only wonders how the sufferers of the dramatis personce are col lected ; but oaths, promises and bribes, being the stock machinery of this sort of drama, we knov that if the first are sufficiently solemn, the second profuse enough, and the last large enough, it can always be attempted to be got up with a tolerable prospect of success. For true tragedy, the work never produced a more accomplished stage-manage than Abbas.PRELIMINARY MATTER. Ivii ed I do not conceive I should much amuse or inform on many of my readers by entering further into a detail of the various hostilities which took place between ns, the Persians, the Othmans, and other barbarous to states and people, during this long reign. Milton the considers the early battles in this island, between ob- the Picts and other barbarians, to be equal, in point md of interest and instruction, to those between crows ise- and kites : and I have so profound a respect for the bas opinions of that most excellent and divinely-gifted icir person, that I shall allow the reader to seek, in his other pages than mine, the account of these san- lese guinary transactions; which, if it be his taste to hey read of human misery and human suffering, or to inst read of some of the finest parts of this globe being the alternately devastated and ravaged by this Pasha or But that Khan, he may, in those pages, gratify himself lies, to his heart's content. For my part, I count only d in that mortal to merit the title of ' Great,' who bene- ecu- fits, not injures, nor destroys his species: and I am ssts, not ashamed to confess, I am so little dazzled with t of the exploits of conquerors, that whether they be nied lartars or Turks, Romans or Greeks, Gauls or dej-i Goths, French or English, I see the same hateful col- passions governing them all, and nothing exhibit- the ^ )U t one same and disgusting picture of blood, noff murder, rape, and rapine, painted in the colours of :on (l Hell. can It must not, however, be omitted to remark, that abk m this reign the flags of England and Persia ap- ork peared together in hostile array against the posses- sions and settlements of the Portuguese in the Gulf 1 cisia. Ormus was besieged by the allies; andlyiii preliminary matter. on the 21st April, 1622, the fort surrendered to the English, probably imagining them to possess better faith and more humanity than the Persians. The fort, and the military stores contained in it, were shortly after delivered to the Shah. Abbas might have had the usual royal motives for war with the Por tuguese ; but our motive was commercial jealousy and cupidity; and we were willing to shed a certain quantity of human blood for a certain number of bales of silk to be annually delivered to us at an inferior price, and for a fraction of the customs of the Port of Gambroon, to which the former trade of Ormus was attempted to be removed. I do not, I cannot wish to enter into a defence of the Portuguese and their government in the Kast; for at the time we are speaking of, they were, perhaps, the most nefarious and profligate set of vagabonds imaginable; and none amongst them (if we may believe Pietro della Valle, was more so than their commander, lluy Ferara de Andrada). I remember reading, when I first went up the Gulf of Persia, some fragments of the transac tions and correspondence of our Factory at Isfahan shortly after this event, in which we lauded our selves very much for the honest manner in which our part of the treaty was performed, and cast some severe reflections on the cunning and tricker) of his Persian majesty. The factors at Isfahan seem ed to forget Abbas was king, and themselves only merchants ; and that, in the game of commerce, the King is a more powerful card than the Knave. The frequent wars Abbas had to sustain against the Turks caused him to imagine, that, by cultivat ing a correspondence with some of the differentPRELIMINARY MATTER. lix he European Powers, he might induce them to com- ter mence or continue hostilities against the court of he Constantinople, and so cause a diversion of their ire forces favourable to Persia. With this view, at dif- tve ferent times, he despatched various ambassadors to or- Europe; and he even, through the Missionaries isy established at Isfahan, opened a communication lin with the Pope, under the impression that he had les great influence over the Knights of Malta, who ior were represented to Abbas as being bound, by the of rules of their order, to a constant warfare against ^as the Othmans. In most of these negociations, how- ish ever, we find Abbas mixing the merchant with the eir king; and as the silk of Persia was at that time an ire article of some consequence to several of the states ms of Europe for their manufactures, he was continually ,ne promising to one or other of these states an ex- ]e, elusive privilege in the purchase of that commodity de in Persia. up It is singular enough, that the persons generally ac . employed on such embassies by Abbas were Chris- lan tians, either Armenians or Europeans. Amongst ur- these last, our countrymen. Sir Anthony, and Sir ich Robert Shirley, made conspicuous figures. Both of ast these gentlemen had come to Persia with a design ery offering their services to the Shah, who appears , m , \ ery willingly to have accepted of them. Sir nly Anthony, after some time, was accredited by Abbas the to several Christian Princes; and he proceeded on his mission by the way of Moscow, where he was ns t detained and ill-treated by the Government; but, at* a ^ ei some time, he was allowed to continue his ent journey to the court oi the Emperor Rodolph, who.X PRELIMINARY MATTER. being then at war with the Turks, received Abbas's envoy very courteously. I do not find, however, that the Persian monarch derived much assistance, in a military point of view, from any of the nego- ciations he carried on with the Princes of Europe. Sir Robert Shirley he accredited to James the First; who, in return, appointed Sir Dodmore Cotton to proceed as his ambassador to Persia. With this minister. Sir Robert Shirley returned to Persia; and Sir Dodmore Cotton did not long survive his audience of Abbas at Ashraff. The reception of Sir Dodmore Cotton was not, if we may trust Sir Thomas Herbert's account of it, very promising; for the am bassador had somehow or other injudiciously con trived to make one of the Shah's favourite ministers his personal enemy : and Sir Robert Shirley was, on his return, so pointedly neglected and slighted by Abbas, that he soon sank into the grave, loaded with the honours of a Palatine of the Roman Empire by Rodolph, and with that of Earl of the Sacred Pa lace of the Lateran by the Pope. The exact nature of this last dignity I am ignorant of; but I find the Pope accompanied it, by granting to Sir Robert a very pretty, and no doubt useful, faculty, of ' legi timating all bastards in India.' The scenes which Abbas exhibited in public, on the reception of the different ambassadors sent to him by European Princes, contain such a mixture of buf foonery, brutal drunkenness, and absurdity, as to render them as disgraceful to the memory and reputation of the king, as they must have been dis gusting to such of his guests who had any sense of decency: and if an account of his private debauches,mmm PRELIMINARY MATTER. Ixi in company with his subjects, were given, it would contain one uniform tissue of the murder or muti lation of those who, at the commencement of these mad banquets, esteemed themselves high in the favour of their royal host. But Abbas made it evi dent, that if wisdom, virtue, and beauty, were at these times admitted, or rather forced, into his com pany, they were no safeguards against the terrible effects which wine produced on a temper the most capricious, and on a mind which, when sober, was frequently deaf to the voice of morality and huma nity. I will not sully my pages with an account of these direful orgies ; but if the reader wishes it, he may look into the relations of them by Pietro della Valle, and other European travellers who visited the Court of Abbas. However, I will remark by the way, that if the Shirleys, at the conclusion of their missions, were consigned to neglect, some of Abbas's envoys were still more unfortunate. The person charged with a mission to the Court of Spain, at the instance of a Portuguese Friar who accompanied it in quality of Interpreter, was per suaded to deliver to his Spanish Majesty, as a pre sent, the silk he had in charge to sell. For this act, and for the failure of his negociation. Abbas caused the unfortunate man to be ripped open, in the pub lic market-place. The foulest blot on the memory of Abbas is the order he gave for the death of his eldest son, SefFee Mirza, which proceeded from jealousy at the popu larity which that prince had acquired. It is in vain that paltry excuses are offered for the conduct of Abbas on this horrible occasion. The truth is, hisIxii rRELIMINARY MATTER. own vices and cruelties had made him odious to his subjects, and the virtues and promising qualities of Seffee Mirza had endeared him to the Persians. His unhappy father saw and felt this ; and seeing and feeling it, he adopted the remedy of a base, instead of a good mind.—Guilt is cruel: wisdom and virtue alone dare to be magnanimous. The first nobleman Abbas applied to, to put his son out of the world, refused to imbrue his hands with the blood ol his Prince: another was soon found less scrupulous, and he stabbed the Prince as he was coming from the bath mounted on a mule. Even-handed Justice, which often returns the poisoned chalice to our lips, rejoices, when she records that the scoundrel was, by order of Abbas, afterwards obliged to put his only son to death, and present his head to the king; who, on seeing it, coolly asked him, Halah demaug-it chauk est? 'Now are you in spirits?' And that this miserable wretch was, at last, when in a state of intoxication, murdered by one of his own slaves !— One can scarcely regret that such a person, ' No reckoning made, was sent to his acconnt, With all his imperfections on his head.' If Abbas was a consummate tyrant, he was also a consummate hypocrite. Ten days he passed shut up from the world, with a cloth before his eyes that he might not see light; a whole month he lived on very spare diet; went into mourning a whole year; ever after wore the commonest clothes; made a feast for several of his nobles whom he thought had purposely worked on his mind to the prejudice of his son, poisoned the wine with which they werePELIMINARY MATTER. Ixiii served, and thus, in his own presence, got rid of them all, ' at one fell swoop.' Some have men tioned these acts of the Shah as manifestations of his remorse for the part he had in the murder of his son ; but I cannot pervert my understanding so much as to consider that heaping crime on crime can proceed from remorse, though it may from madness; nor will I believe that he much furthered his pardon from Heaven, or his reputation with the world, when he caused his two other sons to be deprived of sight, in order that his grandson, Seffee, might succeed him on the throne. It has already been admitted, that Abbas was a great and successful warrior ; and if we consider how much of his kingdom, at the commencement of his reign, he found in the hands of the Turks, Uzbegs, and other savage enemies, and look at the boundaries of it as he left them at his death, one must acknowledge, that thus far he merits great praise. But never were there wars waged on both sides more barbarously than these ; none, in which the unoffending citizen and the industrious peasant were more cruelly treated, or more wantonly plun dered. The result of them, no doubt, added to the glory of Persia; but, considering how short a space they produced of stable peace, I must be permitted to doubt, if the account were fairly balanced, whe ther they added much to her happiness. Abbas has been celebrated for his love of justice; but his justice was frequently the justice of a capri cious tyrant, who did not proportion the punishment to the crime, nor the redress to the injury. Death, or the most cruel mutilation, was doomed for heinousIxiv PELIMINARY MATTER. or for trifling offences, according to the humour of the king, or as he was drunk or sober; and it was rarely that a dreadful sentence was passed, but it was accompanied by ' a fool-born jest.' A veteran, who thought his merits neglected, presented a very rea sonable petition for reward to the king, who was offended at it. He drew from the man the name ot him who transcribed the petition. This person he caused to be brought before him; ordered his light hand to be struck off; and told the miserable suf ferer it was to prevent a future loss of kalographic reputation.—The sentence given by Abbas, on the complaint by a soldier's wife of her husband's impo- tency, is too indecent to be related, and, I would hope, too horrible for any being in the shape of man to have uttered. That Abbas manifested a desire to extend and promote the commerce of Persia, there is no doubt; but for whom ?—not for his subjects, but himself. The Armenian merchants at Julfa were little more than his factors; and were selected for the same reason that the Turkish grandees employ the Jews— because they are expert in trick in the affairs of money and commerce, and because, whenever ava rice suggests it, they can be brought to a short ac count, without giving offence to the Faithful. These people Abbas transplanted from Julfa in Armenia, and settled them in a suburb of Isfahan; which was named by them Julfa, in commemoration of their former place of residence. They became useful and faithful servants to the king ; and he, in return, protected them against all extortion, but his own. Besides this, he flattered them by being present,PRELIMINARY MATTER. Ixv every now and then, at some of the greater cere monies of their Church ; from which, however, he seldom returned to his palace without a drunken bout with his Christian subjects, in which his wine was often stained with lust and blood. The greater part of the provinces of the kingdom of Persia depend principally, for their agricultural and horticultural productions, on artificial irrigation; and it is not to be denied, that, in the different works constructed for this important purpose, his country was most highly indebted to Abbas. I have always admired, and admitted, the justness of Swift's re mark—that ' the man who can make two blades of grass grow where only one grew before, does more real good to his country than the whole race of scheming politicians.' And though Abbas's grand design, to afford Isfahan a more abundant supply of water than it then possessed, failed in its execution, it would be a crying injustice to his memory, not to lemark, and applaud, the benevolence, the magni ficence, and grandeur of the project. Abbas died in January 1628, at a palace which he had built, and in which he delighted much to reside, in the province of Mazenderan, not far distant from the shore of the Caspian Sea: and though he at tained the age of seventy, his death is said to have been hastened by the ravages of a disease, the cure of which either the physicians had not skill enough to effect, or the patient not faith enough in their Medicine to allow them to attempt. Of the character of Abbas I have already ex pressed my wish that the reader should form his estimate; but I cannot deny myself the plea-PRELIMINARY MATTER. Ixvii which Abbas was held by his family. As soon as she heard that persons had arrived at Ferhabad, demanding admittance to her son, the barbarous murder of her husband flashed across her mind; and she was unable to connect this demand with any other idea than that of the loss of her child. She resisted therefore, as long as possible, to pro duce the prince ; and when she at last brought him forth, she pathetically said: ' Go, child, to the ' same place where thy father is! Here are the ' murderers, ready to dispatch thee.' What then must have been her astonishment and joy, when she saw the deputation of noblemen fall at the prince's feet, and salute him as their King! It is said, that, by some accident or other, this prince came into the world with his hands tinged with blood ; which his grandfather explained, as sig nifying he would afterwards often bathe them in the blood ot his relations and subjects;—a prediction that, verily, SefFee did not falsify.* To catalogue the murders perpetrated by this monster would be to produce a series of dreadful tragedies, arising from drunkenness, from the most vicious passions, and from brutal rage. It is quite sufficient therefore to remark, that the black list It is not in Modern Persia alone that superstitious interpreta- ^° ns are given to certain accidents: for Plutarch, in his Life of • exauder, relates, that that conqueror was born on the day upon w ch the 1 emple of Ephesus was burnt, which was considered to portend that Alexander should invade Asia.

' What does a father signify to me! I have uo parent but the Shah.' There was, however, one youth who was bold enough to utter sentiments suitable to the sad occasion : and if it were possible that such a trial could happen to any of us, it might be useful to know, that Seffee was cowed by the reply of the young man, and permitted him to depart unhurt. To this long account of daily mur ders and mutilations, there were other punishments inflicted on young noblemen, by orders ol this scoun drel, at which manhood shudders: and one knows not which to abominate most—the monarch who could give, or the people that could suffer, such orders to be executed. In 1642, that is, after a reign of fourteen years, Persia and the world were relieved of this monster: and 1 could almost rejoice to believe it true that so fortunate an event was produced by poison. He was succeeded by his son.PRELIMINARY MATTER. Ixix ABBAS II. At the time of his father's death, this prince was thirteen years old, and was supposed to have been deprived of sight by order of Seffee : but the eunuch to whom the operation was entrusted had humanely passed a cold instead of a hot iron before the royal child's eyes, and . had instructed him to counterfeit blindness as he valued his life. Whilst on his death bed, SefFee lamented the cruelty he had exercised towards his child, and it was then the eunuch thought he might venture to disclose his disobedi ence to the commands he had received. At this communication, the dying monarch expressed great satisfaction, ordered the prince to be brought to him, and caused the grandees of the kingdom, in his presence, to acknowledge Abbas as his successor. During a reign of twenty-four years, this prince exhibited the same vices and profligacy which dis tinguished his ancestors; with this slightly retrieving circumstance, that he was seldom cruel but when under the influence of intoxication. He is said to have been personally brave, and successful in several military expeditions. He had a decided taste for niechanics, and had made some proliciency in drawing and designing. His death was occasioned hy a disease before alluded to, contracted by a licentious course of amours; a disease which at that time was, throughout Asia, very unskilfully treated, and consequently rarely if ever cured. He was succeeded by his son.Ixx PRELIMINARY MATTER. SEFFEE II. The disgusting and woeful tale which has hitherto been uniformly presented to the reader is, for a moment, relieved by circumstances so exceedingly absurd, that one can scarcely relate them with gra vity, or expect that readers totally unacquainted with oriental manners and prejudices will believe them to have happened. Not long after this prince mounted the throne, Persia was afflicted with famine, and the king laboured under a disease which put his life in danger. The skill ol the court physicians was exhausted without effect; and recourse was had, not only to the alms and prayers of the Faithful, but even the Christian inhabitants of Jaffa, whom the Faithful are bound to consider as being in a state of reprobation, received an order to bestow alms and supplicate the Almighty for the king's restora tion to health. Fear is often, in its acts, the most inconsistent of all passions; and perhaps it is not easy to bring a much stronger proof of the truth oi this observation, than that the haughty and self-sa tisfied Muhammedan should for a moment imagine the prayers of the Faithful could be assisted in their effect by those of the Infidel. A crisis appears to have taken place in the king's disorder; and in a few days afterwards he was out of danger, though he continued in a very languish ing condition. The remaining part of the story shall be told in the words of that respectable tra veller, Mons. Tavernier:— ' And for that the physicians could not discover ' the cause of the distemper, the king began toPRELIMINARY MATTER. Ixxi ' believe it proceeded from the ignorance of the phy- ' sicians; for which reason some of them received u none of the best entertainment already. At length ' it came into the thoughts of some others of the u physicians, who were afraid for themselves, in ' regard Persia was thus doubly afflicted with u famine and sickness of the king both at one time, ' it must necessarily be the astrologers' fault, that ' missed the favourable hour when the king should ' have ascended the throne. Thus being troubled &lt;f at their disgrace, pretending to have no less future knowledge than the astrologers, who had not ' chosen a true time for the king to ascend the ' throne, they concluded, that, for the perfect re covery of his health, and of restoring plenty to ^ ^ le na tion, it was necessary to renew the ceremony ' at a lucky hour, and to change his name. This ' P ro position pleased the king and his council. The ^ physicians and astrologers, joining together, ob- ' served the first unlucky day, which would cer- ^ tainly be followed by another that would prove ' fortunate. Now there being among the Gebers * ' some that pretend themselves descended from the ' Rustans, who were ancient kings of Persia and ' Parthia, that very morning one of those Gebers, setting himself on the throne, with his back against a wooden figure which represented him to the ^ Hfe, all the grandees of the court came and did him ^ homage as their king, as he had ordered them to ' do. This action lasted till the favourable hour was come, which happened a little before sunset. 1 hen it was, that an officer of the court came * Fire-worshippers.ixxii preliminary matter.

Presently, upon that, the king appeared ' in the hall; upon whose head when they had put ' the bonnet of the Sophi, and regirt him with the ' scymitar, he ascended the throne, and took the ' name of Soliman.* He was forced to act this ie comedy to satisfie the law, which contrived that ' he should change his name, and take a new pos- ' session of his throne by ejecting a usurper that ' had wrongfully claimed it: for which reason the ' Geber was set up as a pretender, as laying claim ' to the ancient lineage of the Persian kings, and ' being of a different religion. From that time the ' king recovering, and the famine decreasing, the ' physicians were in great repute; and the astro- ' logers cast out of favour, except one or two of ' the most skilful.' Could this prince, when he changed his name, have changed his dispositions and propensities, one might regard the wretched farce just related with less contempt than it now deserves ; but, considering how sanguinary a monster he afterwards became, one wonders to find the pantomine was not acted as tragedy, by the Geber's head being struck off, instead of that of his wooden representative. For the sake of the reader as well as myself, I would willingly find materials to change the complexion of my narrative: but though in the history of other dynasties we read of dissolute and cruel tyrants every now and then holding the reins of government, I fear it is of the * Chardin has given a particular account of the ceremony used on this occasion; which will be adverted to in the Notes.PRELIMINARY MATTER. Ixxiii House of SefFee alone that with truth it can be as serted, that for a space of near two centuries it pro duced no prince whose life was not tinged with an almost daily commission of crimes of the very deepest dye. For some time before Soliman's decease, he was much afflicted with the gout, and in consequence often confined to his bed; where eunuchs became not only his principal attendants, but the persons with whom he principally advised and consulted. They had therefore great opportunities to ingratiate themselves with the monarch; who, in the end, raised them to honour and power, from which they had hitherto been excluded. This, in the next reign, was reckoned amongst the causes which produced the dethronement of the sovereign, and a most cruel ravage of the kingdom by a terrible set of bar barians. Soliman died on the 29th January 1094, leaving two sons of age sufficient to mount the throne: the elder named Abbas, the younger Hu- sain. The characters, figures, and dispositions of these princes were very different: Abbas was manly, well-formed, and fond of martial exercises ; Husain was shy, ill-made, and fond of retirement: and the first proof the kingdom had of the power and influ ence to which the eunuchs of the palace had arrived, was their being able to set aside Abbas, and to place on the throne of Persia the imbecile HUSAIN I. I cannot open the short account I purpose to give of this reign, without noticing that it is sad to find the most inoffensive of the Seffevian PrincesIxxiv PRELIMINARY MATTER. the most unfortunate also : and it is a lamentable fact, which History makes known to us in more instances than the present, that it is often, as far this world is concerned, better to be wicked than weak:— ' But Heaven hath a hand in these events; ' To whose high will we bound our calm contents.' Husain was known, before he mounted the throne, assiduously to have read the Koran; and to have made the multifarious Commentaries on that obscure volume so much his study, that the people of Isfa han were more accustomed, when speaking of him, to call him Mollah Husain, than Husain Mirza. The new king found the royal cellars amply pro vided with choice wines ; and one of the first acts of his government was, not only to order the vessels in which these were contained to be staved, but to publish a severe edict forbidding the use of wine throughout his kingdom. The courtiers who had lived in the good old drunken times of his father and grandfather, and who were too much accustomed to the practice of this vice to break themselves of it, prevailed on the old lady, Husain's grand mother, a recorded tipler, to feign sickness. It was easy to find an accommodating physician to prescribe for her the use of wine. Husain was made acquainted with this, and immediately exempted the aged princess from the observation of his edict. But this was not all that the lady and her advisers wished for: she refused to make use of the remedy, un less it were presented to her by her grandson : and when he consented to do so, a sudden qualmPRELIMINARY MATTER. Ixxv came on, and she declared she could not take the liquid forbidden by the law, unless the king tasted it first. Husain's religious scruples were overcome by his grandmother quoting to him, ' That the ' Kings of Persia were subject to no law, and there- ' fore could commit no sin.' A maxim so commo dious was not likely to be thrown away on a weak mind. The king drank of the wine; from that moment became an habitual drunkard ; and, after wards, whenever occasion required, quieted his conscience with a reference to his grandmother's precious quotation. The bonds of government, and the wisest regu lations of the empire, no doubt were weakened and infringed before Husain mounted the throne. A su perstitious, weak, and drunken monarch, guided by a corrupt and vindictive council of eunuchs, was not very likely to re-invigorate the one, or re-establish the other. When the Philosopher of Malmsbury as serts, ' Money is power,' the truth of his observation is no where better illustrated than in the monarchies of Asia; for among the class of their subjects out of which their armies are formed, patriotism is nothing, and money every thing. Husain appears either not to have been aware of, or not to have attended to, this important fact; for he not only wasted all the money he found in the treasury, but anticipated the revenues of the state, in building costly and luxurious palaces, convents for dervishes (one of which was said to possess a gate of solid silver): and, what was perhaps more ruinous to his finances than all these, he undertook, accompanied by all the women of his haram and their attendants, andIxxvi PRELIMINARY MATTER. escorted by 60,000 troops, a pilgrimage from Isfahan to Meshed in Khorasan, a journey of near 200 leagues; during the whole performance of which every one travelled at the king's expense. The government of Kandahar had been com mitted by the king to the charge of a Georgian nobleman; who conducted it with so much violence and oppression, that a deputation was sent by the inhabitants, to lay a statement of their grievances, as well as a petition for redress, at the foot of the throne. The members of this deputation, though carrying with them the signatures of all the chiefs of the Afghan tribes, were not only dismissed from Isfahan without redress, but treated as the agents of a turbulent and seditious people. The treatment they received appears to have been caused by the superior influence at court of the Governor; and, in consequence, on the return of the mission, he was emboldened to seize, and send to Isfahan as a state- prisoner, Meer Weis, a person of great influence with his countrymen, and a chief of one of the most powerful of the Afghan tribes. To a person who, like Meer Weis, had ability and address enough to become, in short time, a favourite at court, instead of a state-prisoner, the imbecility of the govern ment and the weakness of the state were speedily apparent and presented to his imagination the facility with which his country might free herself from the Persian yoke. Meer Weis also understood, how greatly the cause might be assisted by clothing it with a reli gious motive; and as the Afghans are Sunnies, and the Persians Shias, nothing could be easier thanPRELIMINARY MATTER. Ixxvii to do this. The request he made to the king, for permission to undertake a pilgrimage to Mecca, ap peared so consistent with his religious deportment, that it added to the good opinion Husain had already entertained of him. But Meer Weis designed the journey to afford him the future means of success in his designs ; for which purpose, before he set out from Mecca on his return to the Persian court, he submitted to an assembly of the Sunni Mollahs at Mecca the following questions, to which he desired their answer: 1. Whether it was lawful for Mussulmans {i.e. Sunnies) restrained in the exercise of their religion by heretics {i.e. Shias), to take up arms, and free themselves from the yoke ? 2. Whether an oath taken to a heretic sove reign was binding, when he infringed the convention which he had sworn to observe ? If it be easy to guess what the answers would be to such questions as these by the Meccan Mollahs, who, as already remarked, were Sunnies, and sub jects of the Grand Signior, it is as easy to perceive the use Meer Weis intended to make of them, and the influence they would give him amongst his countrymen. Meer Weis returned to Kandahar about the year 1709 : and very shortly after, the pro fligate governor, as if on purpose to aid the cause the Afghan had in hand, demanded his daughter for his haram. Meer Weis assembled his countrymen, and imparted to them not only the outrageous de mand made on him, but the Fetwa he had obtained from the Meccan Mollahs. The cup of their resent-IXXviii PRELIMINARY MATTER. ment, as a Persian would say, was filled to the brim; and they instantly entered into a most solemn en gagement to attempt the freedom ol their country. It does not come within the plan I have laid down for myself, to wander into the detail of the war which now commenced between Persia and her former subjects. An ineffectual attempt was pre viously made by her, to procure their return to their duty, by negociations, offering concessions and par don : these were haughtily rejected; and after the one side exhibiting a series of cowardice, mis management, and treachery, and the other an unde- viating perseverance in the attainment of their ob ject, Isfahan surrendered, by capitulation, on the 22d October 1722. On the following day. Shah Hu- sain, attended by all his Ministers, proceeded to the camp of Meer Mahmud, who had become chief of the Afghans, in consequence of the death, during the progress of the rebellion, of his father, Meer Weis. In the course of the siege, the supplies of provi sions from the country were completely cut off from the city; and the following circumstances, related by an eye-witness, will serve to afford us an idea oi the straits to which the wretched inhabitants were reduced. When Husain, with his great officers, were compelled to proceed to the Afghan camp, Mahmud sent horses for them to mount; ' there ' being not one left in Isfahan, where all were ' eaten during the siege.' The same person re lates, that in a certain quarter of the city he saw ' a woman with a cat in her hand, trying to strangle ' it; and though the cat, in defending itself, hadPRELIMINARY MATTER. ' made her hand all bloody, she did not let go her ' hold, but, at every bite or claw she received from ' the cat, cried,' Thou strivest in vain ! I'll eat thee ' for all that.' '■—I am really unwilling to put the feelings of the reader to so severe a trial as that of perusing a detail of the disgusting food the besieged fed on, or the horrible means resorted to, to procure it; but the author I have already alluded to relates one anecdote so honourable to human-nature, and which I boldly assert is so characteristic of the Persian people, that I rejoice to lay it before him.— If, after reading this, he unreservedly condemns the national character of the people amongst whom such a circumstance happened, I think he is rash. After relating that mothers did not refuse to sus tain their own life at the expense of that of their own offspring, he proceeds nevertheless to relate:— ' There was a poor blind man in Isfahan, who, ' before the siege, and during the whole course of ' it, lived only by begging, and was alive when the ' Afghans made themselves masters of the city; ' where he continued his old trade of begging, and ' still lived by it under their dominion.' My author concludes with the following remark: ' This ex- ' ample is at least proper to shew us, that beggary ' has resources which sometimes are not found in ' the greatest riches.'—If, by this, he means that the care of our Almighty and most benevolent Father is never withheld from those who stedfastly trust to Him, I most sincerely and devoutly agree with him. The meeting of the victor and vanquished was affecting in the highest degree. The vanquished divested himself of the ensigns of royalty: the1XXX PRELIMINARY MATTER. victor received them ; and the assembled lords and people, both Persians and Afghans, acknowledged, on the spot, Mahmud the Afghan for their sove reign. As the eunuchs have been accused of hast ening, by their councils and conduct, the downfal of the House of Seffee, one is glad to find one of their body who had spirit and courage enough to serve his royal master, ' at his utmost need,' with fidelity and valour; and that when traitors had so far gained on the ear of a weak monarch as to induce him, in harsh terms, to express suspicions which were unjust, felt life a burthen, and proved his fidelity to his sovereign by inflicting on himself a voluntary death; thus also escaping witnessing those miseries which his sovereign and his unhappy family were destined to suffer. When the siege of Isfahan was so far advanced as to make the probability of its ending unfortu nately apparent, it was debated, and determined in council, that one of Husain's sons should endeavour to escape out of the city, to keep the war alive in the provinces, and to prevent the conqueror, if he should be so inclined, from utterly extinguishing the blood-royal. The Prince Tahmasp effected his escape; and though both himself and his son Abbas, under the guidance of Tahmasp Kuly Khan, after wards Nadir Shah, continued to struggle against the Afghan Princes, and though the late king Husain lived some time after he surrendered the crown, yet, to avoid confusion, I shall consider the dynasty of the Seffees as closed by that event; and I shall dismiss it, by copying the paragraph from Sir William Jones to which I have already alluded.PRELIMINARY MATTER. Ixxxi ' Ismail had many eminent qualities, but sullied ' them all by his detestable cruelty. His succes- 'sors, without excepting Abbas, absurdly called ' the Great, were such a disgrace to human na- ' ture, that an account of their lives would be more ' like a description of the tigers in some public col- ' lection of wild beasts, than a piece of history. ' Almost every day of their lives was distinguished ' by some horrid act of intemperance, lust, or ' murder, aggravated by some new circumstance ' ol wickedness. Their very love was fierce and ' inhuman; and they burned, for the slightest of- fences, the most beautiful women of Asia, either because they declined drinking a cup of wine ' more than usual, or interceded for some courtier ' in disgrace. At length, the vein of inhumanity ' seemed exhausted in the family, and left nothing behind it but an inconceivable stupidity.' MAHMUD (AFGHAN). If, as is sometimes asserted, it is advantageous to a nation to fall under the dominion of one more advanced in civilization than itself, there is cer tainly no deeper calamity can befall any State than the reverse of this proposition. The accounts we have received from the Persian Historians, and from the Europeans at Isfahan, witnesses of the passing transactions, agree, that in the barbarity of their manners, and in the very small advance they had niade in the commonest arts and sciences, the Af ghans greatly resembled those hordes who formerly 0 verran the most beautiful and productive countries /Ixxxil preliminary matter. of Europe, and who ultimately effected the destruc tion of the Roman Empire. But it is necessary the reader should not be left to imagine, that because Mahmud obtained posses sion of Isfahan, that his government was therefore submitted to throughout the whole kingdom. It has already been mentioned, that a son ot Hu- sain, named Tahmasp, escaped, by the desiie of his father and the council, from Isfahan, who, imme diately on being acquainted with the unfortunate events which after his departure took place in that city, assumed the title of Shah, and found many Persians, and many districts of the empire, willing to acknowledge his title. Seldom perhaps is it, that, at first, a conqueror is not lenient and mild to those whom he has subju gated ; but, after a short period of deceitful calm, circumstances arise, or are pretended to arise, in the conduct of the vanquished, which are considered as requiring and justifying dreadful massacres and the most severe ordinances. There are relative posi tions, amongst nations and individuals, the ties and terms of which are at times so extremely delicate, so adapted to give ground of mutual suspicion, that hu man wisdom or prudence seems insufficient to pre serve them inviolate. Such is generally the case ol a conquered nation and its conqueror. If, therefore, Mahmud began by continuing the greater part of bis new subjects, who held the high offices of the king dom under Husain, in the same offices, he ended by inviting them to a banquet, and causing them to be massacred. If he commenced by incorporating the/2 PRELIMINARY MATTER. Ixxxiii Persian troops with his own, he shortly after ordered the Afghans to put their comrades to death ; and even went so far, as to direct numbers of the youth of Isfahan, capable of bearing arms, to be destroyed. If, at first, he consulted and advised with the fallen king, and ' omitted nothing to make him easy,' he ended by butchering all his family before his face, and wounding the sacred person of majesty, when attempting to avert the fatal blow from a favourite child. Such transactions as these lead us at once to conclude, that Tahmasp and his supporters were sufficiently active to cause great alarm, and that Mahmud found his new throne by no means free from disquietude. Yezd, the principal city of the province of Ker- man, a place of great importance, still held out against the Afghan, and acknowledged Tahmasp. Mahmud attempted to reduce it, failed, and, in a sally made by the besieged, left 3000 of his best troops dead on the field. Flight then became ne cessary, and his baggage and artillery were left behind, a prize to the Persians. This signal disgrace, the multiplied cares of government, the return of Ashraf from Kandahar, and the discontented state of the army, so much affected the mind of Mahmud, that he determined to undertake a peculiar kind of most rigid penance, 111 the hope of procuring the aid and assistance of Heaven. This terrible trial of corporeal and mental strength and abstraction was beyond the power of Mahmud to support. When the time limited for 'ts continuance was finished, he issued from theIxXXiv PRELIMINARY MATTER. dark and dismal recess he had inhabited, his body pale and emaciated, and his reason impaired. It is true, he afterwards experienced the dawn of a better condition, but it was short, and was succeeded by a relapse; his body became leprous, and his flesh is said to have rotted from his bones. Whilst Mahmud was engaged in his penance, Ashraf was guarded less strictly; he escaped from Isfahan, and entered into a correspondence with Tahmasp, a correspondence probably carried on without much sincerity on either side. The Afghans, however, proclaimed Ashraf king; and he refused to accept the crown, unless he previously received the head of Mahmud; whose days, in a state of phrensy, were hastening to an end; but were short ened, to gratify the wish expressed by his relation. If we think we perceive the hand of Providence, when success, attained in a good cause, by just means, is rewarded with happiness, do not let us forget, when ambition, wading through scenes of rapine, blood, and massacre, is punished by madness, that the finger of God is equally apparent. ASHRAF (AFGHAN). In the course of the late reign, the Turks and the Russians took advantage of the sad state of public affairs, to attack the kingdom in various parts of it. Tahmasp was not, by any means, a prince endowed with qualities necessary to restore the fallen greatness of the House of Seffee; though great allowance must be made for a young man, the ex tent of whose knowledge and experience had, till then, been bounded by the walls of the haram.PRELIMINARY MATTER. Ixxxv Some time after his flight from Isfahan, he had despatched ambassadors to the courts of Constan tinople and St. Petersburgh. The first of these had, probably, already decided on appropriating to itself as much of the western part of the kingdom as it could get possession of; and therefore the Afghans being Sunnies, and the Persians Shias, it made this a pretext to refuse receiving Tahmasp's ministers. Ihe Persian despatched to Petersburgh was more successful. On the 23d of September, 1724, he signed a treaty* between his master and Peter the Great; by which the latter agreed to drive the Afghans out of Persia; and the former, to cede the cities of Der- bendBaku, the provinces of Ghilan and Mazenderan, and the port and city of Asterabad, as the price of such important service. The accession of Ashraf affords another instance how dangerous it is to be too useful in placing an eastern monarch on the throne. Ashraf was prin cipally indebted to Amaun Ullah, a powerful Afghan chief, for his new dignity. That Ashraf, on his accession to the throne, should destroy the ministers of Mahmud, and such as were attached to him, is expected in the East, on these occasions, as a matter of course; but that he should murder Amaun Ullah, and the rest of those noblemen who had conspired hi his favour against Mahmud, appears to us an act of ingratitude, whilst in Asia it is considered an act of prudence. Our actions towards our fellow- creatures, as they spring from fear, are more cruel than any other. The widow of MeerWeis, the mother of Mahmud, * Vide Notes, Vol. II.IxXXVi PRELIMINARY MATTER. was still alive; and had not long before prevailed on her son to spare Ashraf's life, when he had fallen into his power. It is probable this lady made, or was suspected to have made, some move ment in favour of Husain Khan, the brothei ot Mahmud, who was at that time in possession oi Kandahar; in consequence of which, Ashraf thought it necessary to give the old lady a very extiaoidinaiy avis au lecteur: he shut her up for a whole night amongst the putrefying corpses with which the great square of the palace was filled. She was afterwards treated with great respect; and most likely became less inclined to meddle in State athihs, than beioie her admittance into such very persuasive company. In October 1727, however, Ashraf contrived to conclude a treaty with the Porte*; in which was stipulated the cession, by Persia, of the cities of Zanjan, Sultaniyah, Abher, and Teheran; and the restoration of Khoistan, lately reconquered; all ol which, by this treaty, were added to those parts oi Persia of which the Turks were already in posses sion. This treaty seems to have been principally brought about by the circumstance of the Turkish army in Persia refusing any longer to combat against their Sunni brethren. One is not therefore sur prised to find acknowledged in it the Grand Sig- nior's claim to being the visible Imaum on earth; nor that Ashraf should think himself honoured by receiving from the ' visible Imaum' the title ot Sultan, and the liberty of sending a Persian pilgrim caravan to Mecca by way of Bagdad. After experiencing a variety of fortunes, Tahmasp * Vide Notes, Vol. II.PRELIMINARY MATTER. Ixxxvii had retreated to Ferhabad, where he lived under the protection, and almost in dependence on the loyalty and generosity of Faty Aly Khanf. It was at this time, and at this place, that Tahrpasp was joined by Nadir Kuly, a person afterwards destined to play so great and so conspicuous a part in the affairs of Persia. The spirit of Nadir, and the reinforcement of men which accompanied him, roused the prince to action, and rescued him from entire dependence on Faty Aly Khan. A subsequent series of success, on the part of the prince and his new general, created a corresponding degree of alarm in the mind of Ashraf, who, in 1729, marched, with 30,000 troops, to give them battle; which the prince, by the advice of Nadir, did not refuse, though their troops amounted to only 25,000. The shock took place near Damaghan, on the 2d of October. The fate of both princes depended on the issue of this battle, and in it the Afghans are said to have lost about 10,000 men, the whole of their camel-guns, the camels themselves, and all their baggage. On their retreat towards Isfahan, they plundered Teheran; and on their reaching the capital, they plundered that also: they then took post at Moorchakoor; when, on the 13th November, Nadir again attacked them, and gained a complete and decisive victory. The Afghans fled to Isfahan, where Ashraf found time enough to imbrue his hands in the blood of the feeble Husain, to put to death all the remaining males of the Seffee race, a nd to pack up and depart with all the treasures &lt;i nd richest effects of the palace.

The Persian troops followed the Afghans to Is fahan, close enough to put an end to a second pillage of the city by the populace: and it is men tioned, that Tahmasp, on entering the haram of his palace, was met by an old woman, meanly dressed, who threw her arms about his neck, and told him she was his mother! The Princess, during the seven years of the Afghan usurpation, had been destined, by her barbarous conquerors, to perform the lowest offices ot menial drudgery. The flying Afghans were quickly pursued by the Persian troops, headed by Nadir, to whom, on this occasion, extraordinary powers were granted by Tahmasp. The fugitives were pressed upon so hard, that they were obliged to separate; much oi the booty, and all the princesses carried away trom Isfahan, were recovered; and Ashrat, about whose person a faithful company of near 200 Afghans re mained, was attacked by a body oi Ballooches. H e and his friends made a gallant defence, but, in the end, were all cut in pieces. Thus concluded the Afghan invasion of Persiaan awful lesson, that if the victors obtained a short possession of a great kingdom, it was attended with nearly as much misery to themselves as to the vanquished. TAHMASP II. After what the capital had suffered under the Afghan usurpation, it was quite natural that Tah masp, on entering it, should be received by its in habitants with every demonstration of affection andPRELIMINARY MATTER. Ixxxix joy. One of the first acts of the new king was, to connect his fortunate General with the royal family, by giving him the hand of the princess, his aunt, in marriage. At this time the Turks were in possession of many places and districts on the western side of the king dom; but Nadir had already wrested from them the important cities of Hamadan and Tauris, and Tahmasp had in person invested Erivan. Want of provisions, however, obliged him to raise the siege; and in his retreat he was followed by the enemy, who came up with him at Asterabad. Here a battle took place, the consequences of which were the recapture of Tauris and Hamadan by the Turks. Notwithstanding this, the state of affairs at Con stantinople, where Ahmed III. had been recently deposed, induced the Turks to offer a peace, which was concluded in the month of January 1732.* The principal articles of it were, that the Arras should in future be the boundary of Persia towards Turkey; and that Turkey should assist Persia in expelling the Russians from such places as they had possession of on the borders of the Caspian. When this treaty was concluded. Nadir was absent from court; but the terms of it no sooner came to knowledge, than he strongly remonstrated against them to Tahmasp, designating the treaty as dis honourable and unsafe, and urging his sovereign to ratify no treaty with Turkey which did not include the restitution, by her, of the whole of the con quered provinces. By way of answer to his re monstrances, an order was despatched to Nadir to * Vide Notes, Vol. II.xc preliminary matter. disband the army under his command, then amount ing to near 70,000 men, who were entirely devoted to their general. Instead of obeying this order, Nadir marched towards Isfahan, and in the month of August encamped near that city. It was now easy to perceive that matters between an able general, with a powerful army under his command, and a feeble and powerless monarch, were fast approaching to an issue ; and there could be no great difficulty in predicting what that issue must be. That any line of conduct would have prevented the ultimate execution of those ambitious designs which Nadir now began to entertain, may admit of doubt; but I think one may be allowed to esteem the order sent so hastily to him, to disband the troops, as impolitic, as irritating, and as likely to give rise, in the mind of Nadir, to suspicions that his degradation, if not his ruin, was meditated. Had Nadir been ordered to lead the force under his command either against the Turks or the Russians, there is no reason to think he would have refused to obey the order. Had such been the case, it would have given Tahmasp the benefit of turning over a few more pages of the chapter ot accidents, in which, perhaps, he might have found one, relat ing to himself, written in fairer characters than that one which now presented itself. Instead of this, after assurances on one side, and reproaches on the other, the king consented to accept an invitation to be present at the review of the encamped forces, and afterwards to partake of a splendid banquet prepared by the general. Towards the end of the feast, and when Tahmasp had drank freely, he wasPRELIMINARY MATTER. XCI made prisoner. The army, having been previously rendered disloyal by the intrigues, the bribes, and the promises of Nadir, made no difficulty, there fore, to declare the incapacity and deposition of Tahmasp, and, under the influence of its leader, to proclaim as the sovereign of Persia an infant then in bis cradle, under the name of ABBAS III. who received the title of King—for it would be an abuse of words to say the government of Persia—in 1733. The power of the State was now entirely in the hands of Nadir. To convince the Persians that he had blamed the peace, which Tahmasp had concluded with the Porte, on prin ciple, he lost no time in laying siege to Bagdad, the government of which, at that time, was en trusted to Ahmed Pasha, a person of great ability and bravery. Ahmed, with a garrison, as it is said, of about 20,000 men, defended the place for three months; affording time for Topal Osman Pasha, who had been appointed General-in-chief, to come to its leliel with 100,000 men. A battle between the Turks and Persians soon took place, in which the Persians Were defeated ; and obliged to retreat, with the loss of all their baggage, and 30,000 troops. The Per- siaii general, however, found resources speedily to ^pair the losses he had sustained, and in the month of October again forced his way into Turkey; and in the neighbourhood of Kerkook he once more ttet his former opponent, Osman Pasha. The hostile armies came in sight of each other on the 25th of that month, when some partial affairsxcu PRELIMINARY MATTER. took place, in which the Persians were worsted; but on the next day a general action ensued, in which the Turks suffered a complete and decisive defeat, leaving their brave commander, and 40,000 men, dead on the field, and losing the whole of their baggage and military chest. After such a victory, it must have been vexatious to Nadir to be obliged to relinquish the design he had formed, of recommencing the siege of Bagdad; but Muhammed Khan Balloochy, at the head of 30,000 troops, had announced at Shiraz his adhe sion to the cause of Tahmasp. It was necessary, therefore, to meet, and put an end to such a move ment, as soon as possible: and when the opposing chieftains did meet, the force on either side was as nearly equal, in point of numbers, as possible; but the veterans who followed Nadir were irresistible, and Muhammed, being defeated and captured, pre ferred a voluntary death to a public execution. The years 1734 and 1735 were employed by Nadir in prosecuting the war against the Turks; and in sending an embassy to the Court of St. Petersburgh, in the name of Abbas, proposing an alliance with the Empress, and the restitution to Persia of the places within the kingdom, then in possession of Russia. From the result of this negociation, it seems as if Russia had been deceived in the real value of the acquisitions she had hitherto made in Persia; for the expense of maintaining them was found to exceed the revenue they produced, and on this ac count she consented to restore them*. Nadir had by this time driven the Turks wholly out of those * Vide Treaty, Notes, Vol. II.PRELIMINARY MATTER. xciii parts of Armenia and Georgia which had formerly made part of the Persian empire; and he had severely chastised the Lesghees, and other barbarous people inhabiting the north-western side of the Caspian. He now advanced from Teflis with 50,000 men, to meet his old enemies, the Turks, at Erivan. The famous Kuprili was posted there, at the head of 80,(100 troops. A battle, which lasted five hours, soon took place ; in which the Turkish General, and several other Othman officers, lost their lives, and 20,000 Turks were slain: thirty-two pieces of can non, the baggage, and military chest, fell into the hands of the Persians, who pursued and harassed the flying Turks. The Porte sought peace; but as Nadir insisted on the reddition ol Bagdad, and an indemnification for the expenses of the war, the negociations for that purpose came to nothing. The child king died early in 1736; whether from disease, or poison, is not ascertained. At all events, it was not likely that Nadir should much lament that Abbas had left the world for him ' to bustle in.' The Reader will long ago have perceived, that it has not been my design, in compiling these pages, to lay before him a regular History of Persia, but only to present him with sketches sufficient to introduce less abruptly the translation of the MS. —I shall therefore treat the following reign as I have done the preceding ones.

After three days debate, or more properly, perhaps, after three days employed by Tahmasp Kuly in bribery and intrigue, the assembly came to the resolution of elevating him to the throne. It seems, however, there was a disposition in the priesthood to prevent, if possi ble, the choice of the assembly falling on Tahmasp Kuly, who had already manifested a disposition to appropriate some of their revenues to the exigencies of the State. This ecclesiastical cabal, however, was stopped by the timely execution of the Shaikh- el-Islam, or High-priest; and on the fourth day, in the morning, that is, on the 14th March 1736, Kuly Khan mounted the throne ot Persia, under the title of, NADIR SHAH. The part taken by the priesthood to prevent the elevation of the new king was not likely to be over looked by him; and on his arrival at Kazwin he called together a synod of the ministers of religion throughout the kingdom. To this assembly he com municated the confiscation of the greater pait of their revenues ; sarcastically acquainting them, that as their prayers had not averted from Persia the dreadful calamities she had suffered from the Af ghans, it was evident they had been unacceptable to the Deity ; whilst it was equally evident, from tin success which had attended them, that the efforts made by his soldiers for this purpose were gratef to the Almighty; and being so, he considered t fPRELIMINARY MATTER. XCV soldiers to have a better title to the revenues of the Church than the priests. Before this synod broke up, he published an edict, or ritual, which had for its object the adjustment of the differences, on mat ters of faith, between the Sunnies and Shias. This edict, probably, was well thought of at Con stantinople ; for before the end of the year a peace was concluded between Turkey and Persia, by which the whole of the conquered provinces were restored to the latter, and Persian subjects permitted to per form the pilgrimage without any tax being levied on them. Nadir, after this, employed some short time in repairing different royal edifices which had been injured at Isfahan; but Husain Khan, the brother of the late Afghan king, Mahmud, being still m possession of Kandahar, it was highly im portant, either to wrest that government from his lands, or reduce him to submission and obedience, or tins purpose. Nadir marched to Kandahar; and m various skirmishes, which took place under the wa Is of the city, the king's troops were uniformly vie onous; but the place itself held out, and Nadir wanting heavy artillery, was without the means of ieducing it: he therefore found it more prudent, wifl i llte i'est, to effect a compromise usain, than to continue the blockade.

The Mogul empire in India had for some time been convulsed to its centre, by the intrigues and factions of the great Omrahs ; and from several of them. Nadir, whilst at Kandahar, received an invita tion to undertake its invasion. To these traitorous overtures the king acceded; and he set out on a march to India in the year 1738. The result of this great expedition is known to every one, as well as the astonishingly valuable plunder with which Nadir and his troops returned to Persia. During the king's absence in India, the most un favourable reports prevailed regarding the expedi tion ; and the Uzbegs of Balk and Bokhara, trusting to the truth of such reports, considered the time propitious for the invasion of Persia. On his return, Nadir put himself at the head of 50,000 men, resolved to punish their insolence. The Khan of Bokhara early submitted, and was pardoned; whilst that of Kieva, who had formerly put to death the envoys sent to him by Nadir, was, with thirty of his prin cipal officers, publicly executed. It was not, however, on the Uzbegs alone that the unfavourable reports from India had a pernicious effect. Raza Kuly Mirza, whom his father had left Regent of Persia, was tempted by them to declare himself King. It is said. Nadir had a strong affec tion for this prince, and that he would have par doned the imprudence he had been guilty of; but that the prince, on being brought before him, used language so harsh and irritating, that, in a paroxysm of rage, he ordered him to be deprived of sight Raza Kuly's attempt to mount the throne cost8 PRELIMINARY MATTER. XCV1I Shah Tahmasp his life j for lie instantly, on comin*'' to this determination, gave orders to put the fallen monarch to death, which was done in the Fortress of Sulzawar. As Nadir, on his return from India, approached Meshed, an event took place which had a calamitous effect on his temper and conduct throughout the remaining part of his life. He was shot at, and wounded in the hand, by an Afghan, said to be em ployed for this murderous purpose by his son, Raza Kuly. If this be true, the prince may, in some degree, be considered as meriting the severe sen tence passed on him by his father; and the whole transaction becomes more horrible and distressing. After this time the government of Nadir, from his indulgence in intemperance, from his suspicion, horn his cruelty, and from his avarice, became so intolerable, that revolts against it were daily and hourly springing up in every part of Persia. To quell these, scenes of misery and bloodshed were exhibited, which humanity shudders to think of. In addition to these calamities, war broke out again between Turkey and Persia; but a signal and most oody defeat, which the former suffered in August 1745, near Lrivan, produced a renewal of peace. In this battle Nadir had two horses shot under him. It now became every day more apparent, that t ^e mind oi Nadir was deranged, and the morbid | fusion under which it suffered was of the most anientable character for his miserable subjects; Hl an en ^ to his furious career, however, was now ' as t approaching. Before I relate it, I consider it N uith while to transcribe the picture of Persia atPRELIMINARY MATTER. XC1X At last, on the 8th June 1747, the monster met his fate, near Kabushan, in the province of Kho- rasan, towards which he had marched, with the design of punishing the Kurds in that neighbour hood, who had revolted. Three officers of rank, according to Mirza Mahdy, entered the royal tent at midnight, and accomplished, not without a strug gle on the part of Nadir, the death of the king; or, as the Persian secretary hyperbolically says : ' lis firent une balle de paume de cette t^te que ' I'univers pen auparavant ^toit k peine capable de ' contenir.' Nadir had one project which I must not pass over in silence, because it differs so much from any formed by his predecessors. He was anxious to create Persia a naval power, both on the Caspian and Persian Gulf; or, in other words, to render those seas to Persia, as the Black Sea was then to Turkey, mare clausum.' To effect this on the Caspian, he employed an Englishman, named Elton, to build vessels of war: and to effect it in the Gulf of Persia, ^ purchased at Surat, and other ports of India, several large ships of the same quality. When I anded at Bushire in 1784, the remains of three of ^ ese vessels were then lying off that town ; and the m ost perfect of them appeared to be about 500 tons burthen.

For instance, an English army is composed of men of the same country, officered by persons who hold commissions from the crown, have certain limi ted and prescribed duties according to the rank of their commissions, and each of them has one common purpose in view. On the contrary, a Per sian army is brought together under the command of governors of distant provinces, who, except in furnishing a quota of troops, are nearly independent of the crown; who have often separate interests; who frequently speak different languages; and who are only held together by the power with which their sovereign wields the sword. This was parti cularly the case with the army which had just been deprived of its leader; for it was composed of Afghans, Uzbegs, Indians, and Persians, properly so called; and the consequence of this was, that the two former immediately made an attack on the latter, which was however repulsed. The ephemeral beings who were now hailed by the army as Kings of Persia, and their rapid succes sion, may remind us of the stage direction in the second witch scene in Macbeth—' Eight kings ap pear and pass over in order—and we might wish for the power of making them ' As shadows come, and so depart.' But no sooner does Adil Shah, Ibrahim Shah, Shah Rokh, or Ismail, appear on the stage, than he attempts to murder his predecessor; and to destroy, or deprive of sight, all his kindred, who have the misfortune to fall into his hands. So that within little more than twelve months after Nadii &gt; death, none of his male descendants were left, ex cept his grandson. Shah Rokh, and him deprived ofPRELIMINARY MATTER. sight; nor any descendant of the Seffee, except by the female line. Of those who claimed this honour one was Ismail, whom Aly Murdan Khan Bakhtyari, and Kerim Zend, put on the throne, in 1750. A large part of the plunder which Nadir had brought out of India he had lodged in Kelaat, a fortress in Khorasan ; to render which impregnable he had exhausted the skill of the Persian and Indian engineers. Adil Shah, by the carelessness of one of the garrison, got possession of the fort, and the treasure it contained; which last he soon dissipated, in the most foolish and profligate manner. Let me pause here, and remark, that if the justice of Heaven does sometimes seem to us mortals to slumber, yet, if we look more nearly at the course of events, we shall find it is in the end sure and certain; and History contains not a more striking example of this truth, than the severe and awful retribution which fell on the children of the detes- able SefFees and blood-thirsty Nadir. Let men, in all situations, remember, God has proclaimed, that ' He will visit the sins of the fathers upon the children, unto the third and fourth generation and let those who read these pages acknowledge how literally and strictly these words of immutable truth have been fulfilled in Persia. It has been already mentioned, that Ismail was put on the throne by Aly Murdan Khan Bakhtyari and Kerim Khan Zend.

Sir John Malcolm opens the account he gives of Kerim Khan with the following remark, to the truth of which I most heartily subscribe The happy ' reign of this excellent prince, as contrasted with ' those who preceded and followed him, affords to ' the Historian of Persia that description of mixed ' pleasure and repose which a traveller enjoys who ' arrives at a beautiful and fertile valley, in the ' midst of an arduous journey over barren and ' rugged wastes.'—It is true, that the first years of Kerim Khan's struggle for power were marked by the calamities common to a state of civil war; but Persia, for nineteen years afterwards, enjoyed an almost uninterrupted state of internal tranquillity, external respect, and the advantages arising from the benevolent and enlightened spirit of her ruler. Although, by the death of Aly Murdan Khan, Kerim Khan was relieved from the opposition oi a very formidable rival, there still remained two other persons, opponents of considerable power, capable and desirous of preventing his arrival at the supreme power of the State. One, in the person of Azad Khan Afghan, who had possession of the great and rich province of Azarba'ijan; and the other in that of Muhammed Husain Khan Kajar, who was master of the province of Mazenderan and several of the adjoining districts. These chiefs continuedPRELIMINARY MATTER. to combat one against the other, with various suc cess, till the year 1757 ; when, by the flight of Azad Khan into Turkey, and afterwards into Georgia, in the view of receiving assistance, the arena was left to be disputed by Muhammed Husain and the Zend chief. In April 1758, Muhammed Husain Khan left Istahan at the head of a puissant army, as it is re ported, of 80,000 combatants, to besiege Shiraz, in which place Kerim Khan had shut himself up, with a comparatively small garrison. The enemy en camped round the walls of the town; but Kerim Khan found means to communicate with different bodies of the besiegers, and to employ money so adroitly, that desertions from the Kajar force be came frequent and important. To this was added a most spirited sortie made by Shaikh Aly Khan, a i elation of Kerim Khan, and the most able general he possessed. These untoward events obliged Mu hammed Husain, in the month of June, to raise the siege; and falling back on Isfahan, he found his affairs there in such a posture, as to render it pru dent for him to continue his march into his own province of Mazenderan. This event afforded Kerim Khan the means of le-entering the capital of the kingdom; and his character was now so well established for great poli tical sagacity, for bravery, for clemency, and for good faith, that the wishes of the inhabitants of Isfahan, and of all the southern and some of the northern provinces, were warm in his favour. A rea sonable prospect therefore now opened itself to him, 0 i being speedily able to put an end to the internal commotions of his country.civ PRELIMINARY MATTER. Having employed, at Isfahan, nearly twelve months in forming various regulations and plans for the benefit of the kingdom and the stability of his go vernment, Kerim Khan, towards the end of the year 1759, directed Shaikh Aly Khan to proceed from Teheran, with about 12,000 cavalry, against Muham- med Husain Khan. The Zend general attempted to pass into Mazenderan by the Pylae Caspiae; but these were well guarded by Muhammed, an ollicer of Husain's, and the attempt failed. The wary general then tried to seduce Muhammed from his fidelity to his master. In this, by the payment of a large sum, and by the promise of procuring him the dignity of Khan, and, in case ot success, the future government of the province, he was successful; and the Pylae Caspiae were passed, without resist ance, by himself and his troops. Muhammed Husain Khan was then at Saru; and the news ot the treachery of his officer, and of the appearance of the enemy, were brought to him nearly at the same time. The Kajar had with him from 8 to 10,000 troops; and the only choice left him was of surren dering, or meeting his enemy in the field;—of escape there was no hope. The choice Husain made was that of a gallant and brave man: the result of it was most unfortunate: flying from the field of battle, and wounded in many places, his horse got entangled on the marshy shores of the Caspian; where he was overtaken by his pursuers, killed, and his head brought in triumph to the victorious general, who now, without difficulty, reduced to obedience the whole province of Mazenderan and Tabaristan. The government of the former province was con-PREUMINARY MATTER. CV ferred on the traitor to whom it was promised; the treasures amassed by the Kajar, taken possession of; and seven of his sons delivered to Kerim Khan. Although I have said that Persia enjoyed under this amiable prince nineteen years of tranquillity, it must be understood that this period was sometimes interrupted by factious cabals of discontented chiefs; but, after the reduction of Lutf Aly Khan, never in such a manner as to give the Vakeel (the title which Kerim Khan assumed) serious uneasiness, or to prevent him pursuing an unrestrained course of improvements and embellishments in his kingdom. The inhabitants of the southern provinces of Persia, and the people of the different tribes who wander through those provinces, as well as the Arabs settled in the Dushtistan, had been so faithful and so useful to the Vakeel at all times and on all emergencies, that his resolution to establish the future seat of his government in that part of the em pire was rather expected than wondered at; but, independently of such consideration, it would be difficult to find, throughout Persia, a plain more fertile or more beautiful than the one in which Shiraz stands. To this favourite city, in 1775, the Vakeel returned, and never again left it till his death. His time here was uniformly spent in promoting the interests and welfare of his people, both at home and abroad. Perhaps no monarch, in the same space of time, ever bestowed on a city more useful, more orna- niental, and, according to the taste of the Persians, more beautiful buildings than the Vakeel erected at '^uraz. He was aware, that a large army, unem-cvi PRELIMINARY MATTER. ployed, is always dangerous; and that if ' Idleness is the parent of Evil,' be a proverb applicable in the case of an individual, it is not misapplied when pre dicated of an army like his own. The walls of Shiraz, the excavation of its deep and broad fosse, the beautiful bastions by which the latter was com manded, and its well-arranged and strongly-built gateways, exhibited a perfect specimen of Oriental fortification; and on this great work the troops were employed. The Vakeel found employment for the poor, by the erection of a noble and regu larly-built bazaar, extending, in length, something between a quarter and half a mile; in the midst of which was placed a splendid caravanserai, serving at once as a custom-house, lodging for merchants, shops to hold their wares, and, in some measure, as an Exchange. At one end of a very spacious square stood a citadel, provided with a deep ditch and draw-bridge ; in which were contained a treasury, the mint, the palace, and the seraglio. On the op posite side of this square was a large and commo dious gallery for the royal Nokara, or military music ; on the left hand was the Divan Khoneh, or Hall of Audience ; on the right, the entrance to the Bag Shah, or Royal Garden, in which stood a highly- ornamented building, called the Koolah Fringee, or European's Hat; because, being triangular, it had some resemblance to that absurd and comical co vering for the head, a cocked-hat. Besides these, Shiraz was indebted to the Vakeel for a noble mosque, not quite finished when he died; a spa cious and splendid bath; and an Umbar or reservoir, of water, capable of supplying in summer the wholePRELIMINARY MATTER. CV1I city with that necessary element, in its purest and most limpid state. Such works were conducive, either to the safety and comfort of the citizens, or to the dignity of the government. But the benevolent mind of the Vakeel stopped not here. Without the walls, he laid out gardens, and erected buildings, in which the citizens might recreate and amuse themselves; and all these were constructed with such beautiful bricks and correct masonry, that if equalled, they were not surpassed, in Europe, by either materials or work men. Amongst these resorts for rural enjoyment, might be reckoned the Tomb of Hafiz, the Tomb of Saadi, the Heft Tun, and the garden called Dil- gushay. I had the pleasure of seeing all these buildings in 1787, nearly in the same state as they were in at the death of the founder, before the scoundrel treachery of Hajy Ibrahim had delivered the beautiful Divan Khoneh to be plundered of its rich furniture; and before the arrival of the fero cious eunuch, who disfigured or destroyed almost every building in the city erected by the Vakeel, under the idea, that by carrying away the grand pil lars and beautiful marbles with which some of them were adorned, he adopted a means of destroying that which Time alone could effect—the memory of the benefits bestowed on Shiraz by the Vakeel; and who, when his savage and vindictive heart expressed satisfaction in bursting open and destroy ing the beautiful tomb which held the mortal re gains of Kureem, ordered the bones of that great man to be burnt before him in a chafing-dish, and scattered his ashes to the wind! forgetting, that itCviU PRELIMINARY MATTER. was by the noble and merciful spirit which once animated those reliques that his own life for many years had been spared. It is painful to add, that whatever part of these buildings the vengeance of the eunuch spared, or the good taste and mild nature of his nephew, the present king, took pleasure in repairing and restoring, the wrath of Heaven, by an earthquake, has within these few years nearly en- gulphed or demolished. The rapid succession of rulers after the death of Nadir Shah had obliged the gentlemen in charge of the English commercial establishments in the inte rior of the kingdom to put their employers to fre quent and heavy expenses, on the score of presents; whilst the decay of trade afforded no extraordinary profits to meet them. In consequence, orders had been sent from England, to withdraw such interior establishments, and to confine our commercial inter course with Persia to the Port of Gambroon; where our factors had fixed themselves, after the capture of the Island of Ormus; and where privileges had been granted to them by Shah Abbas, greater in name than effect. As early however, in the govern ment of Kerim Khan, as 1763, Mr. Price, who was then chief at Gambroon, and had the management of the East-India Company's affairs in the Persian Gulf, considered the political state of affairs to be sufficiently settled to justify a hope that the com merce with the interior might be renewed with ad vantage. Two gentlemen, therefore, of the name of Jervis and Durnford, were despatched, to settle, if possible, a factory at Bushire; and to apply for the restitution of the factory-house at Shiraz,PRELIMINARY MATTER. C1X formerly inhabited by the English. On this mission, Mr. Durnford was sent to Shiraz, whilst Mr. Jervis was disposing of a cargo of British goods at Bushire. As the Vakeel was anxious to promote and extend the commercial interests of his country, Mr.Durn- ford's mission was favourably received; and he soon returned to Bushire, furnished with grants from the Government highly liberal and satisfactory. In the year 1772, Bagdad and Bussorah were ra vaged by one of the most direful plagues on record; by which these great and important cities, and the districts depending on them, were injured alike in their population, commerce, and other resources. Such is the character and nature of the Turkish Government, that, instead of giving countries, visited by calamities of this sort, time or assistance to re cover their former flourishing state—such, I say, is the nature of the Turkish government, that it con tinues to levy and extort from a population of sixty the same sum which before was paid by a hundred; and such extortion, it may easily be imagined, is attended with the most crying oppression. Omar Pasha, a weak and needy ruler, then held the government of the great Pashalik of Bagdad and its dependencies ; and from such a man, under such circumstances, it is not at all surprising that fre quent and just causes of complaint should be af forded to Persia, of the manner in which her merchants and her pilgrims were treated at Bagdad, Bussorah, and other places subject to Omar. Against this conduct the Vakeel made frequent and spirited representations to the Court of Con stantinople ; which either treated them with indif-cx preliminary matter. ference, or answered them with promises, not only never performed, but perhaps never intended to be performed. A conduct so insulting, aided by the increasing clamours of his subjects, roused the spirit of the Vakeel; and very early in the year 1775, he sent against Bussorah a large force, under the com mand of his brother, Sadik Khan ; with a view, as he declared in a sort of manifesto published on the occa sion, ' to open the eyes of the sleepy-headed Turks/ The city surrendered on the 16th April 1776; and the Mutsaleem Suleiman Aga was sent prisoner to Shiraz, where he was detained till the death of Kerim Khan. Whilst Sadik was at Bussorah, his brother, the Vakeel, died; and other views opening to him in Persia, he evacuated the place, and deli vered it into the charge of the Ions, and Mr. La- touche the English resident, till Suleiman Aga could be sent from Shiraz. As long as Sadik was pre sent at Bussorah, the inhabitants had no serious cause of complaint; but when the unfortunate city was delivered, during a former temporary absence, to the rule of Muhammed Aly Khan (the same who lost his life in an action with the Arabs on the western bank of the Euphrates), they had abundant reason bitterly to lament the absence of their con queror, and of his mild, amiable, and disinterested Minister, Mirza Muhammed Husain. The Vakeel, full of years, full of glory, possessed of the hearts and blessings of the people, died, in his palace at Shiraz, in 1779 ( a. h . 1193), on the 13th of the Muhammedan month Safar. With him perished the fortunes of his House, and, for several years, the felicity of Persia.PRELIMINARY MATTER. Having reposed, according to Sir John Malcolm's metaphor, for some time in a ' beautiful and fertile valley,' it is unpleasant once more to pursue our journey ' over barren and rugged wastes,' where every stone is tinged with blood, and every path bordered by destruction. A new dynasty will soon open upon us ; and the person destined to effect the change was his pri soner when the Vakeel expired. The benevolent disposition of the Vakeel had made the captivity of this person as little irksome to him as possible ; and it is reported, that, on occasions of importance, sen sible of his sagacity, the Vakeel even took counsel from the son of his former rival. Be this as it may, the eunuch enjoyed a considerable degree of per sonal freedom ; for he was permitted to enjoy the pleasures of the chase in the neighbourhood of Shiraz, whenever he had an inclination to do so; and the Kajar prince made use of this to effect his escape from the hands of his enemies. With the seven sons of Muhammed Husain Khan, on the de feat of that chief by Shaikh Aly Khan, there was also a daughter delivered to the Vakeel. This lady con trived to keep up an uninterrupted correspondence with her brother; and in consequence of the infor- niation she gave him respecting the critical state of the Vakeel's health, on pretence of hunting, he left Shiraz on the 12th Safar, the day before the Vakeel expired. He was therefore, fortunately for him, without the gates of Shiraz when he received notice () t the important event which had taken place; and he returned no more to his former abode of captivity, until he returned to it as its master, andCX11 PRELIMINARY MATTER. the possessor of the treasures it contained. He luckily effected his escape to Mazenderan without accident; and on his arrival there, the dependants of his family received him with joy, and, by their adhesion to him, enabled him to declare himself a competitor for the throne. When the decease of the Vakeel was made public, two-and-twenty of the principal noblemen, his rela tions and generals, repaired to the citadel, to ac knowledge, as it was supposed, his eldest son, Abdul Faty Khan, as his successor. Zikey Khan, however, his father's half-brother, refused to accompany them; and they were weak enough to proceed without him; thus leaving him to employ the great treasures he had amassed in corrupting the part of the army, and its officers, which were stationed in the city. The monster promised them, in addition to present gra tuities, the plunder of the citadel, in the event of their success; and under this promise, they hesi tated not immediately to invest that building. The wretched inmates had neither apprehended nor prepared against a measure of this sort; and consequently, on the third day of the siege, want ot provision obliged them to enter into negociation. The unfortunate have seldom more left them than a choice of difficulties ; and though these noblemen, from the general treacherous and cruel conduct and character of Zikey Khan, might be, and pro bably were aware, what slender trust could be re posed on his oaths or promises, yet, to rely on these, or perish by hunger, were now the only alternatives which presented themselves. Assurances of per sonal safety and liberty, strengthened by oaths thePRELIMINARY MATTER. CX111 most solemn which their religion prescribed, were conveyed to the captives. To these assurances, and to these oaths, they trusted, and were deceived; for, on the reddition ot the citadel, they were brought out one by one into the presence of their victor, and there one by one, before his eyes, butchered in the most barbarous and insulting manner. The young prince was placed under strict confinement, and a most dreadful proscription took place in the city. The movements of the eunuch, Aga Muhammed Khan, in Mazenderan, now began to give the usurper uneasiness, and attract attention. With a view of repressing these, his grandson, Aly Morad Khan, was sent as Governor to Isfahan; but the affection which the inhabitants of that city expressed for Abdul Faty Khan, with a reflection on his own situation, and on that of the character and situation of his grandfather, induced Aly Morad to espouse the cause of the captive prince, and proclaim Abdul Faty Khan king of Persia. The usurper was not slow in endeavouring to ^ring matters to a crisis; and he would soon have met his grandson in battle, had not death at once put an end to his crimes and career. It is not unlikely that the defection of Aly Morad inflamed the natural cruelty of Zikey Khan's mind; par ticularly as, after obtaining possession of the citadel of Shiraz, he had treated him with con fidence. Be this, however, as it may, on his ar- ^val at Yezdikhast his sanguinary excesses greatly ^creased. The murder of a Syed or descendant of the Prophet, and the subsequent orders given for hCXIV PRELIMINARY MATTER. dishonouring the female part ot the deceased s Li- mily, gave rise to a conspiracy to rid the world ot so brutal a tyrant. The conspirators, to the amount of seventy, who were Ghoolams, or men ol his body guard, attacked his tent as the evening diew in, they cut the cords by which the tent was supported, and, after it fell, wherever the canvas appeared to move they hacked with their scymitars, till the bocty of Zikey Khan was literally cut in pieces. On his death-bed, the Vakeel had appointed his brother, Sadik Khan, guardian to his son. AVe have seen, that at that time Sadik Khan was employed in the government of Bussorah, which he evacuated, and proceeded to Shiraz by forced marches. The good character of Sadik Khan caused the inhabitants to throw open the gates to him, to receive him with joy, and for a moment to hope that he was destined to restore the former happy times of the Vakeel. This joy, however, was trans ient, and these hopes were delusive ; for no sooner had he gotten his unhappy ward and nephew in his power, than he deprived him of sight; and by this cruel act forfeited that which he had hitherto en joyed, and which, if his judgment had not been per verted, ought to have been dearer to him than a crown —the good opinion of all good men. ' But in these cases 'We still have judgment here, that we but teach ' Bloody instructions, which, being taught, return, ' To plague th' inventor. Even-handed Justice ' Returns th' ingredients of our poisoned chalice ' To our own lips.'PRELIMINARY MATTER. CXV This wanton and unexpected barbarity towards the prince his nephew, and the profligate and op pressive conduct of his three sons, alienated from Sadik Khan the hearts of his former friends; and they willingly opened their gates to Aly Morad Khan, who, after what had happened at Yezdikhast, had pursued his march towards Shiraz. The person of Sadik Khan, and three of his sons, soon fell into the victor's hands; and he, without scruple or re morse, immediately caused their eyes to be plucked out. A fourth son of Sadik Khan's, who was at this time absent from Shiraz, found means to make his peace with his relation; and we shall see him, by and bye, figure on the stage, as a formidable com petitor for the throne. These transactions bring us to the year 1781: and I vvill not trouble the reader with an uninteresting account of marches, leaguring of petty towns, and other proceedings of no great general interest, which took place, on the part of Aga Muhammed Khan, to increase his power; or on the part of Aly Morad Khan, to check it; but at once relate, that, in the year 1784, Aly Morad marched with such a force from Isfahan, that, had he lived to employ it as he intended, he would in all probability have reduced the Kajars to nearly the same state as that in which they were during the reign of the Vakeel. fhe health of Aly Morad, in consequence of excessive drinking, had for some time been de clining; and he was now seriously afflicted with a dropsy on the chest. From the fatigue of the march, aided perhaps by anxiety of mind, the disease, as he approached Mazenderan, rapidly increased to h 2CXVl PRELIMINARY MATTER. such a height, as to render him incapable of ap pearing to his counsellors and troops at those hours when a king of Persia is expected to do so. His Minister was a person of eminent sagacity and judgment; and when the continuance of his mas ter's life could scarcely be depended on from day to day, he saw the imprudence of a nearer ap proach towards the enemy. He lost no time there fore, on his own responsibility, in issuing orders, in the royal name, for the army to return to Isfahan: and though the king breathed his last at Moorcha- koor, thirty miles from that capital, the wary Mi nister contrived that the troops should remain igno rant of the loss they had sustained, till themselves, the baggage, and the military chest, were lodged within its walls. Banker Khan, the governor of Isfahan, when the death of the sovereign became known, imagined him self, for a few days, king of Persia; but the arrival in the capital of Jaafer Khan put an end to his dream: he fled, and was made prisoner. I shall beg to pursue the same course with this reign as I have done with the preceding one; that is, to pass from the year 1784 to 1787 without mi nutely noticing the struggles in different parts of the empire between Jaafer Khan and his rival, Aga Muhammed Khan. It is necessary, however, to mention, that the former had been early obliged to abandon Isfahan, in consequence either of the treachery or the cow ardice of the person to whom he had committed the command of the troops stationed at Koom ; for, on the approach of Aga Muhammed Khan towards thatPRELIMINARY MATTER. CXV11 place, this person fled in such disorder, that the troops, having no longer a leader to keep them to gether, dispersed themselves in small bodies all over the country ; and their former commander did not consider himself in security till he reached Isfahan. There the disgraceful panic, under which the com mander at Koom had acted, communicated itself to JaaferKhan, his Ministers, and the troops within the capital. A retreat appeared necessary, and it commenced in the night. The haste and confusion with which this measure was resolved on in the council com municated itself to all ranks; whilst darkness, and the partial glare of torches which the fugitives were obliged to use, to find their way through the intri cate streets and bazaars of Isfahan, turned alarm into terror. At this moment. Banker Khan, who had contrived to escape from his confinement, collected a rabble, and fired on the king in his passage through the city. This riotous attack had the effect of caus ing the loss of many mules laden with treasure, and of others carrying some of the ladies of the haram. Jaafer Khan, however, afterwards regained posses sion of Isfahan, and retained it for some time. A circumstance must now be related, which, in its consequences, cost Jaafer Khan his life. One of the ablest, and at this time the most attached of his generals,wasHajyAlyKuly Khan Khazeroonee; and this nobleman had also great influence in the southern part of the province of Fars. He had lately performed a service of consequence, by quelling a seditious rising, headed by the Governor of Jundah, to whose assistance the Khan of Tabas had sentcxviii PRELIMINARY MATTER. 500 Khorasan infantry. This body had shut them selves up in one of the neighbouring forts ; and Kuly Khan found it impossible, from the strength of the place, to get possession of it, otherwise than by solemnly promising the garrison safety of property, of life, and limb. This solemn promise having been acted on, was communicated to Jaafer Khan, who refused to ratify it. Vexed, and considering himself disgraced by the refusal of his prince to ratify the agreement he had made, Hajy Aly retired to Kaze- roon, followed by his retainers and dependants. The king soon perceived the mistake he had been guilty of, and the danger of leaving this nobleman, in his present discontented state of mind, at Kazeroon: he therefore, partly by force, and partly by the em ployment of oaths and promises, prevailed on him once more to return to Shiraz, and to put himself in his power. Shiraz, at the time of Hajy Kuly Khan's return, contained also a prince of the Zend family, powerful enough to excite the jealousy of his sovereign : and, early in the year 1787, both of these persons were arrested, and confined in the dungeons of the citadel. If, in the year 1788, Jaafer Khan had materially extended his dominions to the eastward, by the reduction of Lar, Aga Muhammed Khan had esta blished his authority as far as Khomsha, a place about thirty miles to the southward of Isfahan. Little remains to be told of Jaafer Khan, except the manner of his death. It has already been men tioned, that he had confined, in the citadel of Shiraz, Syed Murad Khan, who had once put forth some feeble pretensions to the throne; and Hajy KulyPRELIMINARY MATTER. cxix Khan, who complained of the capitulation which he had granted to the Khorasan infantry not being ratified. It was unfortunate for Jaafer Khan, that one of the female attendants on the haram had for merly belonged to Syed Morad Khan. The prisoners, somehow or other, found means to communicate with this woman, and, through her, to administer to the king, in his food, at various times, small portions of some poisonous drug. When the hag had received information that Jaafer Khan's health was so far destroyed, by the use of this deleterious food, that its restoration was impossible, she effected the re lease of the prisoners, who instantly proceeded to the sick monarch's bed-room, to murder him. Feeble and ill as he was, the king no sooner saw the pri soners at liberty, and with arms in their hands, than he guessed their intention, and, making a last effort, severely wounded one of the conspirators before he yielded his life. The monarch was yet warm, when they cut off his head, threw it over the draw bridge into the square before the citadel, and pro claimed Syed Morad Khan king of Persia. A few months before this assassination took place^ the king had sent a force, under the command of his son, Lutf Aly Khan, a youth scarcely of age, to reduce to obedience some refractory chiefs in the Germaseer. The melancholy news of the event which had taken place at Shiraz reached the prince in Laristan : his army immediately revolted, plun dered the camp, and dispersed. The prince him self escaped, with five attendants; and arrived in safety at Bushire, a port in the Persian Gulf. There the old Shaikh, the governor of the town andcxx PREL1MINAUY MATTER. district, received him with the attention and gene rosity due to his misfortunes, and, admiring his gal lantry and spirit, promised to use every effort to place him on the throne lately filled by his father. The Shaikh's influence amongst the inhabitants and chiefs of the Dushtistan and Germaseeres was very great; and in the course of about three months, a very formidable force was collected for the purpose of restoring the prince. To oppose this, a force had been despatched from the capital, by its new master, Syed Morad. These last troops had reached Doulaky, when a mutiny broke out; and they seized their commander, the brother of Syed Morad Khan, and delivered him to to prince, who instantly put him to death. The prince and his friends had contrived to open secret communications with several powerful noble men, and others, within the walls of Shiraz; and amongst them it was arranged, that on the day fixed for the mutiny of the army in the field the person of Syed Morad Khan should be seized in the city: this part, however, of their plan failed, and Syed Morad escaped to the citadel. The reader, I hope, will pardon me, if I treat the reign and misfortunes of the noble Lutf Aly more in detail than usual. I received great kindness and attention from him, when he filled the throne; and under a miserable tent, I had the honour of sitting on the same horse-cloth with him when a fugitive! His virtues endeared him to his subjects; and the bravery, constancy, courage and ability which he manifested under his misfortunes, are the theme of poems and ballads, which, it is not improbable, willPRELIMINARY MATTER. cxxi last as long as the Persian language itself. He was manly, amiable, affable in prosperity, and under calamities, as great and as severe as human-nature can suffer, he was dignified and cool and determined. That so noble a being, that a prince the hope and pride of his country, should have been betrayed by a wretch in w r hom he placed, or rather misplaced, his confidence—that his end should have been marked by indignities exercised on his person, at which human-nature shudders—that his little son should have suffered loss of virility—that his daughters should have been forced into marriage with the scum ot the earth—that the princess, his wife, should have been dishonoured—are dispensations of Providence, which, though we must not arraign, we may permit ourselves to wonder at! The prince's march from Doulaky to Shiraz was more a procession of triumph than the march of an army; and on his arrival at the capital, he entered it amidst the acclamations of his delighted subjects. Syed Morad Khan was soon compelled to deliver up to the king both himself and the citadel, and suffered the punishment of instant death; whilst mercy was extended to some who could little have expected to have received it, who, and when they had received it, shewed afterwards how little they bad deserved it. Amongst these was Mirza Mahdy, a scoundrel who had formerly been disgraced for peculation with the loss of his ears ; and who, when the head of the late unfortunate monarch lay in the square before the citadel, insulted by the rabble, cut from it the ears, in revenge for his own, justly 01 kited. 1 he pardon ol this man had been obtainedcxxii preliminary matter. from Lutf Aly Khan, by assurances, from interested persons, that he had not been guilty ot this toul act, though many persons had been witnesses of its per petration. It was not likely that the widow of Jaafer could stifle her feelings at so great an indig nity offered to the head ol her late loid, and it was as little likely that she should refrain from sift ing to the bottom the accusation made against Mirza Mahdy. But it was not until she had ob tained the most clear and decisive evidence on the subject, that she claimed from her son the punish ment of the offender. Deceived as Lutf Aly Khan had been in the first instance, the tears and strong reclamation of his mother for vengeance had their full effect; and in a moment of ungovernable pas sion he condemned Mirza Mahdy to that death which, under a hypothetical case put to him by the king, he acknowledged himself to deserve. He was burnt alive. The king was scarcely settled in possession of Shiraz, when Aga Muhammed Khan advanced to besiege it. With his accustomed gallantry, Lutt Aly Khan marched to meet his enemy in the field; hoping thereby to save the citizens and inhabitants of his capital from those miseries to which a large city, when invested by an enemy, is unavoidably exposed. The very great disproportion, in point oi numbers, between the Kajar and Zend forces alone gave the victory to the former. Lutf Aly fled to Shiraz, and the Kajar immediately invested that city. The deep fosse, the beautiful bastions, and strong walls, with which the Vakeel had surrounded his favourite residence, put the enemy to defiance;PRELIMINARY MATTER. CXXiil and having, in the course of some weeks, been unable to make any impression, Aga Muhammed Khan raised the siege, and retired to Teheran. It was imagined, however, that in the succeeding year, 1790, Aga Muhammed Khan would renew his attack on the city : and Lutf Aly Khan made the most formidable preparations to render the attempt, if made, ineffectual. The harvest in the neighbour hood of the city was cut and housed without hin drance or interruption ; and the season became so far advanced, as to relieve the king, his ministers, and the citizens, from all alarm of the enemy invest ing the city in the course of that year. The active mind of the Zend prince could not permit the force he had collected to remain idle ; and he determined to employ it in reducing to perfect submission and obedience the Governor of Kerman, whose conduct had been doubtful, and whose fidelity was suspected. Unfortunately, the king did not sufficiently attend to the representations which were made to him, that if the advanced state of the season had relieved him from the apprehension of Aga Muhammed Khan's attacking Shiraz, it was more than probable that the same cause, that is, the approaching winter, Huglit distress his troops on the expedition he was about to undertake. Whilst the army lay before Kerman, the winter set in with unusual rigour. The sufferings of the troops were excessive ; and the ^ing found himself foiled, and obliged to return to Shiraz, not by the enemy, but the elements. 1 must now introduce myself as an actor in this drama, and narrate, somewhat in detail, how ' came to be so. Mirza Muhammed Husain, whocxx i v PRELIMINARY MATTER. had successively been Vizir to Sadik Khan, Jaafer Khan, and Lutf Aly Khan, and who in the year 1787 received me so kindly at Shiraz, afteiwaids passed through Bussorah on a pilgrimage to Mecca. When Bussorah was captured by the Persians, this great and honest Minister had, on all occasions, used his influence with his master, Sadik Khan, for the special protection of such individuals as were recommended to him by Messrs. Latouche and Abraham, then in charge of the English Factory there. The late Mr. Manesty and myself, therefore, considered it to be a sort of duty to manifest to the Mirza, during his residence at Bussorah, our sense of his former kindness to the Factory. The Mirza professed himself extremely gratified by the attentions we paid him: and, on leaving Bussorah, he said to me: ' The last time you came to Shiraz ' you came for your health; promise me now, that, ' as soon as I return, you will visit me for plea- « sure.' But I do not know that the promise I then made would have been fulfilled, but for a vei) curious circumstance. The superior mind of Lutf Aly Khan led him to despise the value set by weaker minds on jewels as personal ornaments; and to consider them only as the portable representatives of so much money, which, when important occasions required, these representatives might be called on to produce. He had formed the same scheme that his prede cessor and relation, Aly Murad Khan, had done; that is, of collecting a force of such magnitude as to 1 him a rational chance and hope of putting an end, at one blow, to the struggle between the Kajar anPRELIMINARY MATTER. himself. With this view, Mirza Husain was directed to communicate to the merchants of Bushire, that the king had determined to sell the two largest of his diamonds, one known by the appellation of ' the Sea of Light/' the other by that of ' the Crown of the Moon,' if purchasers for them could be found. This communication was principally made to Hajy Kheleel, the same person who, afterwards elevated to the rank of Khan, was deputed as Envoy to the Marquis Wellesley, then Governor-general of India, and who unfortunately and lamentably lost his life in endeavouring to quell a disturbance which took place at Bombay between a part of his Sepoy guard of honour and some of his attendants. The merchants at Bushire, as might have been expected, were afraid to enter on such a specula tion as the purchase of these remarkable and valuable gems in their own names, but they had no objection to engage in it under the names of others. In consequence, they wrote to Mr. Manesty and myself, giving us an account of what was going on; entreating also, as I understood the language and Mr. Manesty did not, that I would immediately repair to Bushire, in order that something on the subject might be arranged. It was finally, however, concluded, as the best cloak to what was going on, that Mirza Husain should write me a letter, claiming the performance of my promise to visit him at Shiraz, a nd that I should take Bushire in my way there. ^ ery early, therefore, in the spring of the year 1 left Bussorah for Bushire, where I soon found the matter in hand was not likely to be brought to 1 s peedy conclusion, from the possessor putting tooCXXV1 PRELIMINARY MATTER high, and the proposed purchasers too low a value on the articles offered for sale. Still, however, there was reason to imagine, that when I came to treat with the Ministers and jewellers at Shiraz, it miglu be brought about; because it was clear that the king was earnestly bent on selling, and theie no difficulty in forming a society ready to furnish the very large sums necessary to make the pvn- chase. Besides all this, I was really desirous to visit Mirza Husain again : the society and pleasures of Shiraz, which I enjoyed in 1787, were also much to my fancy and taste; and moreover, I had great curiosity to see the king, who, on my first visit to the capital, was quite a youth. I determined there fore to proceed; and I reached the capital at a pe riod the most delightful and luxurious of the whole year, that of the first opening of the spring. I was most commodiously lodged by my kind friend, Mirza Husain, in a house close to and communicating with his own, and I received from him every atten tion and kindness that can be imagined. The second or third day after my arrival I was presented to the king, who received me very graci ously ; and was pleased to say that he was glad I was come, for there was an affair which he would direct his Minister to communicate to me, in which my assistance would be required. I had formerly had acquaintance and dealings with his Majesty's principal jeweller, both at Bus- sorah and at Shiraz. I now found him extremel} liberal in his offers to me, and perfectly disposed to afford me his confidence. As a proof of it, after some conversation, he said: ' I shall be appointed toPRELIMINARY MATTER. CXXVU ' negociate with you ; and remember, I shall value ' the diamonds at a much higher price than the ' king is diposed to take for them ; but this I must ' do, both for my own safety and my own credit: ' therefore our demand need not alarm you, nor ' prevent your making what offer for them you ' think right.' I asked him if he would take a share in the purchase. He answered: ' If I were to ' do so, I should never rest afterwards. I wish, ' however, to know your idea of the value of the ' largest of the diamonds, ' the Sea of Light.' ' I replied: ' I could form no idea on the subject, until ' I had seen the stone, and became acquainted with ' the water and colour of it; but if these were ' oi the best, as I had heard, I had no scruple in ' saying it must be highly valuable ; though, from ' what had been reported to me of the substance of ' the stone, I much doubted if it could be cut to a ' brilliant: so that if it continued a table, as at pre- ' sent, the value of the gem in Europe would be ' comparatively small, because table diamonds are '• there held in inferior estimation.' He then pulled out a crystal model of the stone; when I instantly perceived it to agree with the drawing which Taver- nier, in his Travels, has given of a stone offered him at Golconda; and for which, as he says, the pro prietor asked five lacs of rupees, and he offered four. It so happened, that I had with me a copy of Taver- nier; and I shewed the drawing and valuation, there made, to the jeweller; at the same time telling him, that allowing ten per cent, for the present deprecia- ^on of money, Tavernier's offer was the highest offer I should think myself justified in making for it;CXXVili PRELIMINARY MATTER. particularly when the length of time it would take to dispose of such a jewel, and the heavy m eies which would accrue on a capital so employed were considered--unless, indeed, the stone could be re duced to a brilliant, in which case I should alter my estimation. He then said: ' I can tell you the king ' will not part with the Dereya-noor at that price; « yd ' laying great stress on the last word, which I therefore construed to mean, patience. Before left him, however, he said: ' In a lew days, mos likely, the king will send for you.' In a day or two afterwards, being at supper a Mirza Husain's, the Mirza said to me; ' It is the ' king's wish to see you to-morrow morning at the ' palace, at 8 o'clock precisely; but do not mention ' this even to our friend your Mehmandar, Hajj ' MuhammedBebchauny: come by yourself, to the ' drawbridge at the citadel, at the time appointed. ' the Nasakchies* have orders to receive you there, ' and conduct you into the citadel.' I was punc tual to time; and was introduced to a small room very near the entrance of the palace, in w uc i found Mirza Husain, Mirza Bazurg his nephew, an Hajy Eusoph the king's principal jeweller.

The room was open in front; and had a very handsome awning, falling from the parapet, to defend the chamber against the rays of the sun, when necessary. The other three sides of the square were formed by high walls, ornamented with what the Persians call Tauk-nemauh; which I know not better how to describe, than by saying the face of them was worked into arches, bearing the same sort of character, to a full arch, as the pilaster does to the pillar. In the middle of the court was a beau tiful marble fountain; and on each side of that, in a line from the entrance to the opposite room, were two broad beds of very gay and brilliant flowers. The king was sitting, with a crimson cloth cloak thrown over his shoulders, at the corner of one of the windows : and as I approached him, he beckoned to me to enter the room. I did so, standing at a distance to receive the usual order to sit down. The king said; ' Aka,' i. e. Gentleman,' sit yourself down ' near me ; we are now met as merchants—I to sell, ' and you to buy. But tell me, first, what sort of a ' host does Muhammed Husain make to you ?' And then, laughing, said : ' If he lets you want for &lt;f any thing, he must have the felekj-; first, because u the late king, of blessed memory, my father, was ' much pleased with you; and secondly, because I ' understand you did not allow Husain, when he was at Bussorah on his pilgrimage, to want for any ' thing.'

I answered; Mv treatment by INIirza Ilusain was perfectly royal; and that I made use of that \\oid, because, although I was well assured of the Mirzas friendship and kindness, yet I was aware that much of the attention I received, I owed to his majesty s commands. ' You say well, sir,' replied the king, ' but again I ask you, by my soul! does he give you ' wine? Tell me! tell me!' 'Please your majesty, ' your Minister has lodged me in a house next to his ' own ; and ordered a daily quantity of provisions, ' necessaries, and luxuries, to be furnished me there, and in the list of them wine is mentioned; but lie ' has, besides this, done me the high honour to admit ' me a daily guest to his table; and as your majesty ' knows it would be a disgrace to his high charactei ' and birth that such liquor should be produced ' there, so I hope your majesty will believe me, ' when I say, I prefer the honour of being admitted ' to his society before any gratification I could re- ' ceive from drinking the finest wines which Persia ' affords.' ' Well spoken again!' said the king. * t I have heard you were a prudent and discreet man; ' and, in consequence, I have ordered you here, to ' treat with you on a business of importance.' The king then threw aside his cloak, and 1 disco vered that he had been sitting in his alcoluk, or under garment, only ; and that on each arm he wore bazubunds or armlets, containing, amongst many other superb ones, the jewels already noted. These armlets were fastened to his arms by sliding silk strings, and the jewels themselves were set in silver- The king proceeded to unloose these strings; and calling to his Vizir, he ordered him to carry thePRELIMINARY MATTER. CXXXl gorgeous ornaments to me. I stood up to receive them; on which his majesty said : ' Sit down ; exa- ' mine my bazubunds at leisure; but remember, ' you are the first European who has ever had them ' put into his hands from the king's arms. I have ' thoughts of parting with the centre stone in each ' armlet: will you buy them ? ' I replied: ' It would ' be ridiculous in me to pretend to the possession of ' wealth equal to the purchase of jewels of such ' magnitude; but that if his majesty was seriously ' inclined to part with them, I thought I might be ' able to form a society of persons, of whom I would ' be one, able to do so : but, with his leave, I should ' prefer entering into the detail of the business with ' his Ministers and jeweller, to troubling his majesty on the subject.' ' Aye, I know what you mean,' said the king; ' you can speak more freely to them ' than to me. But come ! tell me what you esteem ' the value of the Dereya-noor.' I replied : ' It re- ' quired great consideration, and careful examina- ' tion into many very minute particulars, before I ' could venture to answer such a question.' The king replied: ' Come! come! I am in a hurry : say ' something, that I may be able to guess what we ' are at.' I said : ' Please your majesty, always ' reserving to myself the right to correct hereafter ' the opinion I now deliver, I should not be afraid ' to give five lacs of rupees for the Dereya-noor.' The king burst into a loud laugh, and said: ' So! so ! ' you are a pretty fellow, to value the Dereya-noor ' at five lacs of rupees, when Hajy Eusoof, my ' jeweller, has sworn by his head, and will swear by ' his head any day, that it is invaluable.

The king seemed pleased with this; and having ordered Mirza Bazurg and Hajy Ensoof to be sent for, he rose from his seat on their coming in,saying: ' Well, sir, I leave you to talk with these persons.' He then left the room, attended by his Minister. The eunuch, who had conducted me to this au dience, remained; no doubt to overhear, and i elate to the king, all that passed after his departure. Mirza Bazurg immediately desired me to relate, not only all that the king, but all that I myself had said. On hearing it, he began the farce of finding fault with me in tolerable severe terms, for undervaluing and misprising the king's jewels, in which the old jeweller joined. I said : ' To whomsoever I speak, ' 1 always endeavour to speak truth; and when 1 ' am asked for an opinion, I always give, to the ' best of my knowledge, an honest one; but that, ' the opinion of a person like myself, neither makes ' the Dereya-noor larger nor smaller, nor more nor ' less valuable; and therefore can be of no con- ' sequence.' I found, however, they were deter mined that the eunuch should report them as zealous servants of the king, and so, accordingly, they went on scolding me. At last I said: ' Gentlemen, I ' could bear all this very much better, if I had break- ' fasted; but you will please to remember I have ' not: so, with your leave, I will return home.' On this, MirzaBazurg said; ' No ; the king has ordered a breakfast for you here.' We then all ot us rose, and returned to the little room; in which a most sumptuous and luxurious Persian breakfast awaited us.PRELIMINARY MATTER. cxxxiii As soon as we were by ourselves, Mirza Bazurg said to me : f&lt; I am sure I shall by and bye hear, from ' my uncle, that the king is greatly pleased with the ' manner in which you have conducted yourself ' to-day.' And the old jeweller laid hold of my hand, and, by way of compliment, said: ' My dear sir, if I ' had not known to the contrary, I should have ' thought you had been bred up in Persia.' At parting, the old jeweller asked me to sup with him ; which, after the compliment he had paid me, 1 could not very well refuse to do. I saw now enough, however, of the business, to perceive, if it was to pro ceed further, it would require all the caution I was master of to conduct it to a successful issue. In the evening I saw Mirza Husain, who con firmed to me what Mirza Bazurg had predicted in the morning; adding, that his majesty had said, ' If 'they were to treat for the diamonds with aFringee, ' they could not find a better Fringee than myself.' I told the Mirza where I was invited to supper: he answered, he knew it before; it was by the king's order; and that he should desire my Mehmandar to sup with him, that he might not be in my way. At the hour appointed, I repaired to Hajy Eu- soof's house; which, like most of the other houses of merchants of his class, made externally but a shabby appearance, and was entered by a narrow, low door, and through consecutive passages, all very narrow and very mean. After passing through a small anti- chamber, which is used by the servants to re-dress the caleans, and to receive the slippers of the guests, when taken off, I entered the salle a manger, where I found Hajy Eusoof, and his nephew, andcxxxiv preliminary matter. partner, Mirza Jaunee. The room itselt was ot mo derate size, but every thing in it and about it bespoke opulence and comfort. The side nummuds were of the finest quality; the takth nummuds of the largest size and uncommon thickness; the carpet of the very finest manufacture of Tabas; whilst the plais- tering of the walls was nothing more than the best common gilcarree, the corners ot which were picked out with the most brilliant white chunam. The tracery work, and coloured glass of the windows, were extremely beautiful, and the doors inlaid with various woods. Before the windows was the usual appendage to a Persian room—a flower-garden and a fountain. Both the gentlemen rose to receive me, apologizing for not having asked any one to meet me, as it left us the freer to talk on business. Shortly after this, a censer was brought in, on which were placed small pieces of bois-d'aloe or agla-wood, which, when burnt, sent forth a most delicious perfume. Caleans were then brought; a very highly enamelled gold one, inserted in a superbly-cut glass vessel, was placed before me; whilst those put before the jewel lers consisted of nothing more than a simply turned willow-stick, with a plain glass and black earthen chillum. Coffee was then brought, and served to me in a gold enamelled sous coupe, ornamented with small precious-stones; whilst the jewellers, who I found affected in this respect to live (i le dervich^ drank theirs, using for a sous coupe one cup placed within the other. To the coffee succeeded a pi' 0 ' fusion of the choicest fruits in season, placed in the most beautiful and rarest china-bowls, intermixedPRELIMINARY MATTER. CXXXV with lumps of ice ; the bowls standing on prettily- painted trays, the vacant places of which were filled with the best sweetmeats and made-ices. About nine, supper was brought: long pieces of Masulipatam chintz were laid before us, on which were put trays, painted with flowers, and highly varnished. Each tray contained three seeneys, or large tinned-copper round salvers; one of which held three different sorts of cookery in rice, with meat and vegetables ; another, three different sorts of kaboh or roasts; and the third, three different sorts of sherbet: and in each of the seeneys which held the cookery w 7 ere saucers containing small quantities of savoury-herbs, pickles, salt and pepper. My trays were distinguished by the seeneys being silver, instead of tinned copper. At such entertain ments, the master of the house, after water is carried round to wash the hands, gives the signal to eat, by saying, Bismillah, or ' In the name of Godand when the host perceives his guests no longer helping themselves, he gives the signal to the domestics to remove the things,by saying, Zead kun, 'Do more and after a short pause utters, Alhamd-illah, ' God be praisedand then hot water and soap is brought for the use of each guest, and the caleans are again brought in. Thus passed the supper, which was one of the most recherche I ever partook of in Persia; for, after the things were removed, the room w r as again perfumed with agla-wood ; and a small bottle of atar of roses was brought to each person, of which he used as much as he thought proper. Our discourse after supper naturally turned on the jewels ; and I then found out, what 1 was Mlii , ILiicxxxvi preliminary matter. ignorant of before, that Mirza Jaunee was a very tolerable lapidary. He assured me the Dereya- noor had substance enough to allow ot facets being cut from a girdle; which, when effected would give the stone pretty much the form and lustre of a properly-proportioned brilliant. Mirza Jaunee also told me, that the Dereya-noor weighed 176 carats and a small fraction: and as Tavermet reports the stone he saw in the merchant's hands at Golconda to have weighed 242 carats tV ' 13 , I e g a ' to doubt whether it could be the same stone; ye a little reflection convinced me it was not hkey there should be two stones in the world ol such magnitude, without its being known m whose pos session they were. I recollected, also, the Mogu edict by which the customary weight oi jewels in India was altered, in order that a ruby possessed by the then emperor, which wanted three carats o a miscal, might thenceforward be called a ruby of weight of' a miscal. Thus the number of carats which made the miscal remained the same, but the number of grains that made the carat was reduced, and if this supposition were true, Mirza Jaunce 176 carats, and Tavernier's 242, came pretty mud to the same thing: the flrst making 704 grams, the latter 726. I left the house late in the evening, highly pleased with my reception and entertain ment, little thinking in what a short time afterwar 5 1 was to become domesticated thcie. I fear my reader is already tired of this long story about these jewels and jewellers ; but having begun, I must beg of him to attend me to the en of the tale.PRELIMINARY MATTER. CXXXV11 In about ten days after my supper at Hajy Eusoofs, Mirza Husain desired me to attend at the citadel the next day, when the Dereya-noor and the Taje-mah would be taken out of their settings and shewn to me. I attended accordingly; and I was ushered into the same little room near the en trance, where I had before met Mirza Husain and Mirza Bazurg: there I again found Mirza Bazurg, Hajy Eusoof, and, in addition, Mirza Jaunee. After the common ceremonies of a Persian visit had pass ed, Mirza Jaunee went out, and returned with an eunuch bearing a box, in which were the two bazu- bunds already spoken of. Hajy Eusoof proceeded to unset the stones, by first loosening the rims of their settings, and then extracting them by means of a piece of wax-candle pressed hard on their sur face and then smartly drawn back. The Dereya-noor was the first put into my hands : the shape and size of the gem perfectly agreed with the crystal model, as well as with the size of the drawing given in Tavernier. I saw, also, that Mirza Jaunee was perfectly correct, in saying that facets might with great advantage be cut on it from a girdle; and that the colour was a slight tinge of a palish pink, which I think any jeweller would esteem a beauty rather than a defect, as the water was per fect and brilliant. I perceived also, that, further to improve the stone, it would require re-cutting and polishing; in which operation I calculated there might be a loss of substance something like 20 ca rats, leaving the stone after it to weigh 156 carats. I then examined the Taje-mah, the shape of which resembles an egg divided at fths of its bulk, and cut in facets to the top of the stone : the watercxxxv111 preliminary matter. and colour were both as perfect as I ever beheld, and the weight given me by Mirza Jaunee was 145 carats. This stone I judged, on re-cutting, might lose 15 carats; but the operation, if skilfully per formed, would add greatly to its beauty and brilli ancy, and of course to its value. The centre of each bazubund was formed by one of the stones above mentioned; and three other stones were placed on each side of them, making, in all, twelve additional stones. They were table- diamonds, it is true; but I was assured (and the ap pearance of them bore out the assurance) that not one of them weighed less than 60 carats, and some of them much more. One of the stones had be longed to Aurungzebe's sister, Jehanara; and her name was engraved on it, with a Persian verse, meaning, ' I belong to the flower of the world.' I was repeatedly pressed, by all present, to value the Dereya-noor and the Taje-mah : after much hesitation, I told Hajy Eusoot 1 should not be alraid of giving, for both, twenty lacs of rupees; as they exceeded the idea I had entertained of them, when I saw them before in their settings. Both jewellers immediately cried out, that the sum was small in deed, compared with the estimation made of them by the Persian jewellers. I thought this a good opportunity to ask if the king possessed any ruby of a large size, that was per fect*. I was assured, in reply, he did not; that the * The beautiful ruby belonging to the Mogul, known in the East by the name of Yacoob-el-Abdul Husainee, was traced, after Nadir's death, into the hands of an Armenian; the Armenian was traced on board a vessel bound to Surat; and it is known that the vessel and her crew perished on the bar of the Surat river, and that the Armenian and the ruby went to the bottom together.preliminary matter. cxxxix largest which he possessed, having any pretension to perfection, did not exceed the weight of 10|- carats. After some little general conversation, we parted; and it was not for some time after I got home, that I could prevent myself from thinking of the splendid gems I had had an opportunity of so closely examining: it appeared to me that I had really seen two of the jewels which Aladdin had taken out of the enchanted garden by means of the Genius of the Lamp.f It was some time after this before I heard any thing further on the subject of the jewels: the summer was advancing, and with it the king's pre parations for a campaign against the Kajar and Isfahan. One night after supper at Mirza Husain's, when the other guests had departed, Mirza Husain addressed me, and said: ' The king has, for the ' present, given up the idea of parting with his ' jewels; but, my friend, if you have any other ' business here, finish it as soon as you can ; and ' do not, if you can possibly help it, remain long in ' Shiraz after the king leaves it. You are my guest, ' and a most welcome one you are; but I wish ' you were at the present moment at Bushire!' I left the Mirza's house in astonishment; and on my return to my own, I found there my Mehman- dar, to whom I related the conversation which had passed between the Mirza and myself, as well as the t After I got home, I amused myself with calculating the value of these bazubunds, according to the Tables left us by Jefferies.

He replied, that he believed it proceeded from nothing more, than that the Mirza expected, if the king was unfortunate in his present expedition, the country between Shiraz and Bushire might become so disturbed, that I might find it dif ficult to reach the latter place. This appeared to me very reasonable ; and as I had made considerable purchases, both on my own account and for others, I deemed it most prudent to act on the advice I had received. Accordingly, I began to settle my affairs, hoping to be able to leave Shiraz very shortly after the king's departure. I passed the intervening time much as usual; but I perceived Mirza Husain had become thoughtful and melancholy, often absenting himself from sup ping in public : and I began to apprehend his favour at court might be declining, especially as, when I went to take leave of the king, I observed his majesty spoke but little to him. At this audience, which was private, the king said, that for the present he had given up the idea of parting with the jewels; that I must come again to Shiraz early in the next spring, and, instead of being Mirza Husain's guest, be the king's. He then talked confidently of his success on the present expedition ; and added,By the king's life! stay here until I return.' When I afterwards remarked to the Mirza this request of the king's, his answer was : ' I pray God the king may ' return; but I repeat to you, leave Shiraz as quick ' as you can. Mirza Bazurg remains here for a few ' days; and if you want any assistance, apply to ' him without scruple.' The evening before the king marched, I happenedPRELIMINARY MATTER. cxli to go into the garden of Koulah Fringee, to which I had free admittance; and there I saw the king's son, a boy about seven years old, with his tutor or Lala. I would willingly have avoided the little Prince; but he sent one of his attendants after me, to desire me to come to him. On coming up to him, and saluting him, he said: ' You are the ' Fringee my father so often talks of. You brought ' him a pretty musical clock : did you bring nothing ' for me ? I shall be king to-morrow, whilst my ' father is away; and you must come to see me, as ' you were used to visit him.' I was delighted with the child, and replied, ' What does your high ness wish for ?' Lala,' he replied, ' tells me the ' best penknives are made in your country : do give u me one. And my Dy (i. e. my nurse) says the ' scissors you make are better than ours : pray give ' me also a pair of scissors for Dy.' I happened to have a very fine penknife in my pocket, which I immediately presented him; and told him, that when 1 went home I would send him two or three more, and scissors for his Dy. The child, in the gaiety oi his little heart, exclaimed, ' O! you are a good man!' He kept me walking and talking with him near an hour; and I never saw a prettier-behaved, handsomer, or more intelligent child. Strange to tell, the next time we met was in Azarba'ijan ; him self a shrivelled eunuch, and a slave; myself the accredited Minister of my country, to the suc cessor of the destroyer of his father's house and throne! The king had left Shiraz about six days; when early one morning I heard a noise of a multitude of people rushing along the street; and very soonCxlii PRELIMINARY MATTER. after, my Mehmandar, Hajy Muhammed Aly, arrived, and informed me that Hajy Ibrahim had seized Berkordar Khan, the governor of the fortress, by orders, as he told the people, which he had received from the king. Not very long after this, I was rather surprised to see a guard of musketeers enter my house, attended by a confidential servant of Mirza Husain's ; who acquainted me, that as Mirza Bazurg had left Shiraz for the king's camp, the Khanum (i.e. the Vizir's lady) had sent a guard to protect myself and my property ; and that I was not to give myself any trouble about providing for it, as every provision they wanted would be regularly sent by her. The Mehmandar had gone out to learn what he could of what was passing; and when he returned, he told me, ' The people are tolerably quiet, be- ' cause, as yet, they consider what has been done ' to have been done by the king's order but, he added, ' I do not believe it, because the gates are ' shut, and all communication with the camp, which was free yesterday, is forbidden to-day. Besides, ' a messenger sent by the Khanum to her husband ' has been stopped, and strictly examined, at the ' gate of the city through which he wished to pass: ' and it is said a message has been sent to that lady, ' to tell her, as she values the safety of herself and (t Mirza Bazurg's children, to forbear interfering in ' any thing that is going on :—this convinces me, said he, ' Hajy Ibrahim is a scoundrel.' Towards the evening a servant came, to desire the Mehmandar would attend at the house of Mirza Husain. When he came back, he told me that he had received from the Khanum a message for me;PRELIMINARY MATTER. cxliii and that the Khanum had spoken to him from be hind a curtain. ' Tell my lord's European guest, ' as long as I have life he is perfectly safe. Tell ' him, if the Mirza is absent, the Khanum is present. ' Tell him whatever he wants or wishes, to send to ' me, the same as he would to my lord. Tell him ' his property is our property; and tell him to be ' cheerful.' This lady was a lady of very high birth, great ability, and great courage. As the night closed in, I heard straggling shots in various parts of the city, and every now and then a thundering against the doors of my house with a bludgeon. This was replied to by the guard from the top of the house, sometimes by abuse, and sometimes by firing a musket in the air, to alarm the assailants. My Mehmandar was a fine resolute old man, and a great humorist; and sometimes, on these occasions, went down himself to the door, calling out: ' Scoundrels, I tell you the Fringee ' lives here, who has more fire-arms in his house ' than you have hairs on your heads. Pena-ber- ' Khoda* / if he should use them.' When the morning came, it was known that some partial instances of the plunder of private individuals had taken place during the night; but that the gieater part of the tumult we had heard had arisen from disarming and turning out of the city the few Lacks and Zends who had remained in it after the king's departure. Ahe anxiety of every body to learn what had happened in the king's camp, when the news of 1 ena-ber-Khoda! as much as to say, 'God knows what will happen !'cxliv preliminary matter. Hajy Ibrahim's treachery reached it, became intense; and the best informed in the city soon appeared convinced, that though much tumult and confusion had taken place, the king had escaped safe. Abdul Rahim Khan, as had been agreed on with his bro ther, had made an attempt to seize on the king's person; but, either from his cowardice, which was almost proverbial, or from the bungling manner in which the attempt was made, it fortunately failed. The army, at the moment, dispersed in small bodies, and the king himself took the road to Shiraz: the next day he was joined by several bodies of his troops; but it was not till he was joined by the Zends that he became acquainted with the extent of his misfortune; for till that period he conceived his relation, Berkordar Khan, to be still in posses sion of the citadel of Shiraz. It was one fine evening, that the town became certified of the king's presence in its neighbourhood, by the sound of the camel-guns, which are fired three times during his majesty's march; 1st, where he mounts his horse; 2dly, when he has performed the exact half of the march, in order to acquaint those at the Push-khona, or tents, sent forward, when he is arrived; and, 3dly, when he dismounts at the end of the journey. I shall not easily forget the expres sion of joy which ran through the city on hearing these guns; and yet there was no person left in it of sufficient consequence and courage to lead forth a band to seize the traitor. The king had pitched his tent about one farsang and a half from the city; and he began to fortify his camp. The city soon felt straitened as to provi-PRELIMINARY MATTER. cxlv sions, and Hajy Ibrahim to fear the just and proper reward of his infamous and detestable treachery. Unfortunately for the king, the families of all the principal nobles with him were in Shiraz, and consequently in the power of Hajy Ibrahim. To these persons Hajy Ibrahim, therefore, addressed, and contrived to have delivered, letters, threatening to exercise on the innocent and helpless the se verest tortures, if their husbands and fathers did not desert the king. The effect of these letters was all that Hajy Ibrahim could have wished or expected. The camp broke up; the nobles were received into the city, and many of them confined; and the unfor- * tunate monarch, with about a dozen grooms and other servants, fled towards the Dushtistan. The account of this flight I shall by and bye give, as I had it from his majesty's own mouth. Mirza Husain and Mirza Bazurg now returned into Shiraz. The next day I waited on them ; and saw the first in his private apartment. The fatigue and excitement he had undergone had completely changed his appearance ; so much so, that had I met him any where else, I should with difficulty have recognised him. He rose to receive me, and said : My dear friend ! I am sorry to see you here. I gave you every caution consistent with my situa- tion. Had my advice been taken, Hajy Ibrahim would now be lying in the dungeon of the citadel, mstead of sitting, as he scandalously does, in the (( pl ace formerly occupied by the Vakeel, and lately ^ by my noble and brave master; whose courage and confidence in himself have cost him his thi one, and, from the manner in which we parted, kcxlvi preliminary matter.

I am sorry that we must not now ' see each other very often: but I have spoken to ' Hajy Eusoof; and whenever you find yourself ' tired of being alone, he will be most happy to see ' you, the oftener the better; and what you wish to communicate to me, you must make him the ' channel of it. In the mean time, I recommend ' your asking to see Hajy Ibrahim, and requiring, ' in pretty strong terms, liberty to leave Shiraz: ' after this, we shall be better able to judge what ' course to pursue.' In consequence of the Mirza's advice, I sent, by my Mehmandar, a message to Hajy Ibrahim, ex pressing a wish to wait on him, and asking when he would permit me to do so. The answer received was, that at present he was much engaged, but would fix an early day for my coming. About a week after this, a message came to nie, that I was expected to wait on the Hajy at the Diwan Khonah. On going there, I found him sur rounded with guards and officers, pretty much in the same style as the king, sitting on the same nummud, and in the same part of the Hall ot Audi ence as the king, and affecting the same state. I confess, when I saw this, it brought strongly to m)PRELIM1NAUY MATTER. cxlvii recollection the memorable verse of St. Mark: ' When ye shall see the abomination of desolation '... standing where it ought not ... then let them ' that be in Judea flee to the mountains.' I remarked a strong disposition in the traitor to keep me standing during the visit: I advanced therefore, after a short pause, and sat myself down much higher in the room than I had been accus tomed to do in my audiences of the king. The Hajy opened the conversation, by saying, ' So, European, you are here still.' I answered, ' Yes, and very much against my willand added, ' I ' had come to desire permission to hire mules and ' muleteers to take me to Bushire, and a passport ' from him for my safe passage on the road thither.' He answered: 'All in good time : the roads are un- ' safe; besides which, there is Lutf Aly Khan and ' his Looties in your way, who will plunder you.' I replied: ' I had received so much kindness, and so ' many assurances of protection and favour, from ' the king, that, if I should meet him, I had not ' the smallest apprehension of receiving any insult ' or injury; and that as to Looties, there were ' Looties everywhere.' I soon perceived the last part of my speech was any thing but pleasing to the Hajy; for almost immediately he said, u Is there any thing you want of me.' I replied, ' Yes, to go from hence.' ' Morrukus,' ' You have leave,' an swered he. On which I briskly said, ' Does this tfiean I have leave to proceed on my journey.' ' By no means,' was the reply. 1 then got up, and left the room; as little satisfied with Hajy Ibrahim as Ha jy Ibrahim could be with me. k 2Cxlviii PRELIMINARY MATTER. A few nights before the king left Shiraz, I had supped in company with this personage, at Mirza Husain's, and the Mirza had placed us opposite to each other, on different sides ol the room; but he was now so puffed up with his successful villany, that he neither offered me a calean, nor treated me with any kind of respect. As I have so often mentioned Mirza Husain's sup pers, the reader who has not been in Persia will not, perhaps, be displeased to read how these sort of pub lic entertainments were conducted. The Mirza was a man of unbounded liberality and generosity ; and he made a point, as his nephew Mirza Bazurg aftei- wards did, to render it apparent to every body that he lived up to the full extent oi his means, and put by nothing : the only expensive passion the Mhza had was books, and he was considered to possess the finest and rarest library ever collected by an in dividual in Persia. At these suppers there were generally assembled from twenty-five to thirty persons, a very mixed company, consisting of men of the law, men oi the sword, and some of the principal merchants who either were resident in the city or were visiting it in the way of their business. The first were dis agreeable and solemn ; the second were sometimes men of very high rank, and consequently with great pretensions; whilst the last were shrewd in telligent persons, who had seen a great deal of the Oriental world, and were excellent and instructive companions. The Mirza himself was an elegant poet, under the name of Wafa, or ' the Grateful: he was acknowledged to be the best hand in PersiaPRELIMINARY MATTER. cxlix at a lateefa, joke or pun; and he did the honours of his house incomparably well, giving to each of his guests his full proportion of conversation and attention, and always directing the first to such sub jects as he imagined those he addressed to be best acquainted with. The guests assembled a short time after the hour appointed for the Nemauz-cl-asha or ' Evening Prayerso that we were never disturbed, as in many other houses, by one or more getting up ostentatiously to repeat their prayers. The enter tainment began as usual, with caleans, coffee, sweet meats, and what the Persians call sweet-tea, which is a strong decoction of different spices much sweet ened with sugar. There were seated at the lower end of the room three or four persons possessed of the best voices in Shiraz, and the most celebrated performers on the Kemooncheh, or Persian lyre, who were to be procured. Before the supper was brought in, these persons, at intervals, were called on to sing and play some of the Odes of Hafiz, or some of the Mirza's own lyric compositions. About nine the supper was produced, which was always excellent; and nothing delighted the Mirza so much as to see his guests doing honour to it. When the supper was removed, the room was perfumed, and the caleans again brought in. The Mirza's reader, who had an excellent voice, then came forward, and lead portions either from the Shah Nameh or from prose histories of Persia and Arabia, until the Mirza called out ' Bareek-ulla,' ' Well done;' which was the signal for the reader to leave off, and the guests to depart, except such as wished to speak to himcl PRELIMINAIIY MATTEH. privately on any business withtlie Government, this being the time he always gave private audience to such suitors. Twice, I think, I saw Mirza Bazurg's children brought in, after supper, to entertain the company with what is called capping veise 5 and the quantity of Persian poetry these children could re peat, appeared to me quite astonishing. Shortly after the interview with Hajy Ibrahim, I contrived to see Mirza llusain; who then told me that he daily became more and more anxious on my account, lest, as it was known I was in Shiraz, and Hajy Ibrahim had now opened a communication with Aga Muhammed Khan, an order from that person should arrive for my detention ; which, if he should receive any hint of the business which had brought me to Shiraz, would certainly be the case. The Mirza then went on with these memorable words:—' There has been for some time past a ' confederacy formed between Hajy Ibrahim, his ' brother, and several chiefs of the Dushtistan and ' Germaseer, particularly Raza Kuly Khan Khaze- ' roonee and Shaikh Nassir; the general purport of ' which is, to get rid of the king, and then form ' amongst themselves a federative government, to ' which the Khan of Kerman, and others, should be ' invited to accede: they persuaded themselves, that ' when Hajy Ibrahim had succeeded in getting pos- ' session of Shiraz, the king would easily be made * € away with in camp. This part of the scheme was ' entrusted to the brother of Ilajy Ibrahim, Abdul ' Rahim Khan, to execute; which was just like ' putting a jackass to capture a lion : and as the king is now out of their power, and is collectingPRELIMINARY MATTER. cli ' a force in the Dushtistan, Hajy Ibrahim has des- ' patched persons to Aga Muhammed Khan, to ' assure him that he seized on Shiraz for the sole ' purpose of delivering it to him ; and charged ' these persons with letters filled with lies and ca- ' lumnies against his late noble and royal master. ' Thus the scoundrel, balked in his plan of mad ' ambition, will, unless the king finds means to ' prevent it, deliver the wives and families of the ' inhabitants of Shiraz into the hands of their bit- ' terest enemies, the Kajars. I cannot,' continued the Mirza, ' by any means account for the king's ' infatuation : the conspiracy of Hajy Ibrahim was ' hinted to me some time ago, and I endeavoured ' to put his majesty on his guard; and about a ' fortnight before the army marched from Shiraz, ' the Khan of Bender Reeg gave me a detail of it, ' which I laid before the king. I went on my ' knees to him, to seize Hajy Ibrahim without delay; ' but his high courage led him to slight my repre- ' sentations, as well as the intended treachery; ' and he put off noticing it then, by saying, &lt; It is ' now so near the marching of the army, that to seize him would throw things into confusion ; but I will look to it when I come back; and in the ' mean time, I shall take the precaution of leaving ' Berkordar Khan in command of the citadel/ I ' then,' added the Mirza, ' strongly objected to ' Berkordar Khan being left in the command of the ' citadel; for though he was a very brave, he was a very weak man: and I besought his majesty to entrust that charge to me, and to allow Mirza Bazurg to officiate in the camp as my deputy.clii PRELIMINARY MATTER, ' To this the king replied : * No, Lala, I cannot do ' without you; for we shall certainly bring the ' eunuch to battle ; in which, if we are successful, ' we shall afterwards have plenty of business on ' our hands.'—I should have told you all this be- ' fore, but I did not dare to do so; though you ' must have seen how very uneasy I was, for some ' time before the king left Shiraz. I still fear you ' will have great difficulties in getting away, not ' only as respects the Kajar, but as Hajy Ibrahim, ' I find, now begins to fear that I may make, through ' your means, communications prejudicial to him to ' the king.' We had now reached the middle of October, and I really began to feel myself uneasy about my de parture ; when one evening my Mehmandar came to me, and said, ' Mirza Husain wishes to see you ' at the door of the haram, about the hour of even- ' ing prayer.' I accordingly went to him at that time. He told me, that one of the principal mer chants of Bushire, named Hajy Ibrahim Isfahauny, who happened to be in Shiraz at the time Hajy Ibrahim had seized the governor of the citadel, had received permission to return home to Bushire. 'We must not,' said he, ' miss this opportunity of ' getting you away also. You must ask to see Hajy ' Ibrahim to-morrow : when you see him, you must ' talk very firmly to him; you must complain loudly ' of your detention, and say you are a person in ' office as well as a merchant, and that your Go- ' vernment will not suffer you to be affronted with ' impunity. I will so contrive, that Hajy Ibrahim, 44 the merchant, shall see him first, and shall let himPRELIMINARY MATTER. clHi ' know what sad consequences will arise to the ' trade of Bushire if any thing disagreeable happens ' to you: and after you have seen him, I will either see or write to him myself.' Hajy Ibrahim granted me an interview in the evening of the next day, and was rather more affable than at the first. I acted, however, fully up to Mirza Husain's instructions ; and came away with the assurance, that he would consider about my de parture, and let me know. About four days after wards I received a message, that I was permitted to accompany the merchant to Bushire, that my pass port should be made out, and that I might hire mules for the journey. As soon as I received this message, I waited on Mirza Husain; who asked me to promise that I would proceed to the king, wherever he might be ; a promise which I had every inclination to perform, whatever risk might attend the execution of it. The Mirza also mentioned, that Mirza Bazurg would come and sup with me. Mirza Bazurg came early in the evening; and after we had finished our meal, he said : ' My uncle ' has desired me to come and talk over his situa- ' tion with you, and consult with you on several ' subjects. You know it has never been my uncle's ' custom to lay by any part of the emoluments of ' his office ; so that all we are now possessed of is ' a very small landed property, which has been in ' the family from time immemorial, and which will ' probably be confiscated as soon as the Kajar ob- ' tains possession of Shiraz. The only valuable ' article which my uncle possesses, is his library ;cliv PRELIMINARY MATTER. ' which he considers to have cost him in money ' near 200,000 rupees, and which we think would sell ' in India for a very large sum. The produce of ' this library is the only fund which we have to de- ' pend on for our future subsistence. My uncle has ' therefore desired me to ask you, whether you will ' consent to take charge of it, proceed with it to ' India, and there dispose of it for us ; taking also &lt;f under your management, for our use, the sum it ' shall produce. Our fate, if Aga MuhammedKhan ' obtains possession of this city, will be a hard one. ' Death is probable ; poverty is certain. My uncle's ' heart is broken already : his life cannot last long; ' and when he goes, except on account of the wo- ' men and the boys, I care not what becomes of ' me. This is a time when jewels would be useful ' to us : most persons of our rank and station have them, but we have them not: my uncle's hospita- ' lity has always kept pace with, or rather exceeded, ' his income ; and I do not believe the Khanum my ' aunt, and my wife, possess 2000 piastres, about 130/. ' sterling, between them. My uncle's debts have ' been twice paid for him by two of his royal ' masters, Sadik Khan, and his son Jaafer Khan. ' If you consent to take charge of the library, my ' uncle wishes to see you to-morrow, and shew it ' to you in one of the rooms of the haram, pre- ' viously to its being packed up. For myself, I also ' have a favour to ask of you, which is, to accept ' of my sorrel horse ; for I cannot bear the thought ' of its being possessed either by Hajy Ibrahim or ' perhaps taken from me by some Kajar chief.' It may easily be imagined that I consented toPRELIMINARY MATTER. civ take charge of the Mirza's library, on the conditions communicated to me : and I hope it will be as readily believed, that I refused to accept the horse, except on a condition of my own, which was, that of paying for him, or taking him away to dispose of for the owner. The next day I went to Mirza Husain's house; and the Mirza took me into a large room in the la dies' apartments, which seemed as if they had just left it. The books evidently had been brought from another room, as they were lying on the nummuds. I judged there might be about GOO volumes*;— but such volumes! the rarest, the most beautifully bound, the most beautifully written and illuminated, that could possibly be imagined. The binding of several, as I have before mentioned, was thin plates of gold, highly enamelled, and sprinkled with small jewels; and of others, a sort of papier machee, var nished, gilt, and painted with flowers in those very brilliant colours in which the Persians excel. To give the Oriental reader an idea of the rarity and value of these books, I inform him there was amongst them Shah Mahmud Gusnavi's own copy of the ' Shah Nameh,' in which I observed many marginal notes of various readings, which might perhaps have been taken from the mouth of Ferdousi himself. The Mirza met me with tears running down his face. ' Mirza Bazurg,' he said,' has told me what ' passed between you and him last night. I return ' you thanks: we have been acquainted for some ' time: the way in which you managed my little &lt;f money-dealings for me, whilst on my pilgrimage, * They afterwards turned out to be 755.clvi PRELIMINARY MATTER. ' convinces me you are an honourable man ; and I ' have preferred to trust into your hands the little ' funds which will probably now remain for my fa- ' mily, to confiding them either to my countrymen ' or to any one else. The things you see here are ' the only things I ever coveted to possess: they ' have cost me much time and much money to col- ' lect: some, indeed, are presents from my present ' master's grandfather and father; and it was always ' the intention of myself and Mirza Bazurg, that, at ' my death, his majesty, Lutf Aly Khan, should pos- ' sess the whole. Fate has ordered it otherwise; ' but God's will be done! Will the sale of these ' prevent me from beggary ?' I told the Mirza he knew better than I did; that the books were highly valuable; but as to what might be obtained for them, many of them being unique, must depend on the price the proprietor puts on them, and the will and ability of the purchaser to give that price. ' I will ' give orders,' replied the Mirza,' for packing-cases ' to be made immediately ; and I must give you the ' trouble of coming here, to see them packed.' In this business I was engaged for several days with Mirza Bazurg; to whom 1 expressed surprise at never, on these occasions, seeing his uncle. ' Oh!' said he,' my uncle cannot bear the sight; and I beg ' of you, in any future conversation which you may ' have with him, never to mention a word on the ' subject of his library : since, whatever remains to 4 ' be transacted in regard to that, after its arrival in ' India, I must beg of you to do through me.' When the library was packed, and a list of it made out, I oftered an acknowledgment that the articles whichPRELIMINARY MATTER. composed it were under my care. ' No/' said Mirza Bazurg, ' it is not required: but there is now ' one thing required of you, to which you must ' consent; that is, the acceptance of my horse : it ' is the only return we have it now in our power to ' make, for the trouble you have consented to en- ' gage in.' Every thing was now fast preparing for my depar ture from Shiraz. Late one evening, Mirza Bazurg paid me a visit: he said he came by desire of his uncle, to report to me the substance of a conversa tion which had passed respecting the library, be tween his uncle and his family. The latter had stated to him, on hearing his intention of sending them to India, that the celebrity of the library could not fail of being known to Aga Muhammed Khan ; who, whenever he obtained possession of Shiraz, which was but now too likely, would, if he spared his life, either require from the Mirza a heavy fine, or the gift of his library; and therefore, in either case, if the books were sent out of Persia, it might he ruin to the Mirza and all of them, especially if the library was demanded and not forth coming; as m that case, from the violence of Aga Muhammed Khan's temper, every thing terrible might be ex pected. I saw, instantly, that, in Mirza Husain's pre sent situation, this was a matter requiring the most serious consideration : the result of which was, that the Mirza the next day took a Faiil from the Koran for his better guidance. The Faal pronounced it to be unfortunate to send the library out of Shiraz; an d this, in the sequel, saved Mirza Husain his eyes or his life.Clviii PRELIMINARY MATTER. After taking leave of Mirza Husain, which I shall never forget, on the 1st of November, Hajy Ibrahim the merchant and myself left Shiraz. He had twenty-five mules laden with bulky merchandise. 1 had fourteen, laden with more compact and more precious: amongst which there was one article, which, if discovered, would probably have cost me my life. During the late troubles, a copy of the Koran, in the hand-writing of one of the Twelve Imaums (I cannot now recollect which), had got abroad, and a little Khorasanee Syed, the former landlord of Captain Franklin (Syed Morteza), who managed many affairs for me, told me of it; and said he had not money enough to buy it, but thought, if it were sent to India, it would sell for almost any sum. I gave 100 tomans for it, which makes 1000 Persian rupees; and this manuscript was amongst my baggage. It requires some acquaintance with the fanaticism of the Persians duly to appreciate the horror which would have seized any one of them on seeing this most venerable relique in the hands ot a Cafer Nejees, an ' Unclean Unbeliever;' but I could have no difficulty in guessing what would be my fate, if it were discovered. I am not aware that any separation I ever expe rienced in the course of my life was much more painful to me than that of parting with Mirza Hu sain, Mirza Bazurg, and the family : and whatevei was painful in this parting, was aggravated by the idea, that in a few months, perhaps, that great and amiable Minister might suffer the loss of sight oi death; that Mirza Bazurg might be torn from his children ; that the ladies of the family might meetPRELIMINARY MATTKR. clix with disgrace, and be sent to some remote part of Mazenderan or Gilan; and that the children, brought up so tenderly, and whose education seemed to constitute the great pleasure of the two JVIirzas, might be bereft of their parents and protector. The servants of these amiable personages were affected on this occasion, and did me a thousand little civi lities. At last I left my house, accompanied by Mirza Bazurg, who would see me pass the gates; and it was lucky for me he did so, as otherwise it was evident 1 must have suffered some impertinent detention from the guard stationed there. The pain ful moment of the last Khoda Hafez, ' God have you in remembrance,' came at last: it was, I believe, exchanged with mutual sincerity and regard, and neither party attempted to utter a word more. I had had a long acquaintance and many deal ings with the merchant my companion, who was a shrew r d, sensible man, but, very much like all Eastern merchants, very timid in time of danger, though armed to the teeth when he travelled. It must be confessed, however, that the journey from Shiraz to Bushire at this time was not to be made without serious risk of life and property. At the first en trance out of the Plain of Shiraz into the mountains, &gt;ve leceived a pretty good avis an lecteur of the real ^alue oi Hajy Ibrahim's passports. We were stopped by the guard stationed there, who insisted on search- m g ou r baggage, and levying customs on it; that is, taking out of it that which they liked best. On this occasion I was called on to play the orator; so I at wice desired to be carried to the officer, to whom Iclx PRELIMINARY MATTER. began to utter, in no very measured terms, a grievous complaint. I had not proceeded far in my jeremia- hade, when I was surprised to hear the officer ex claim, ' Ah, azeez ! * is it you ? By my soul, no one shall offend or injure you with impunity!' This passed by the obscure light of a lighted pine-branch held in the open air, which at first prevented me discovering who this well-met friend was : at length, I found him to be an officer much attached to Mirza Husain, who had protected him, and caused his former advancement; and therefore luckily knew how much the Mirza was interested about my safety. We soon now became very comfortable, round a sort of bivouac fire. The officer gave us a good supper, and corn for the mules and horses ; told us to move at midnight; to stop only to rest the cattle an hour or two between his post and the Plain of Kazeroon ; and that when we arrived there, to en camp close to the city walls, and trust Raza Kuly the governor as little as possible. Besides these good services, the officer did what was of infinitely more importance; he sent one of his people with us, to pass us at all the guard-houses on the moun tains, between his post and Kazeroon. On parting with him, he desired me, if possible, to communicate to the king and the two Mirzas what he had done for my companion and myself; adding: ' As to the ' first, had he not been in your company, I would ' have shorn him well, in spite of twenty of Hajy ' Ibrahim's passports, who is, at the bottom, a great ' scoundrel, and into whose power I have no inten- * ' Oh, my dear! 'PRELIMINARY MATTER. clxi ' tion to trust myself again.' In speaking of Hajy Ibrahim, he made use of every opprobrious epithet which the Persian language could furnish. We moved accordingly, at midnight, and in about thirty hours reached the Plain of Kazeroon, without any thing remarkable; and pitched our little tents close under the ruined walls of the town. The di stance we had travelled in these thirty hours was rather better than 100 miles; great part of which consisted of ascents and descents of very high mountains, by roads on which but little speed could be made. Raza Kuly Khan had some years before been banished to Bussorah, where I had rendered him some trifling services when distressed; but he was so heart and soul against the king, that I by no means wished him to know how near I was to him. Our intention w r as to have given the cattle the necessary rest at Kazeroon, and then to have pushed on to the end of our journey;—I to Bender Reeg, and the merchant, my companion, to Bushire. We both of us slept late ; and before I arose, the merchant went into the city, if city it might be called, to pay Raza Kuly Khan a visit. About three in the evening he returned to me, much agi tated. I asked what was the matter ? He said, ' Raza Kuly Khan knew I was there, talked much ' of the kindness I had shewn him at Bussorah, ' and insisted on our both supping with him that 'night.'—' Well,' said I, 'where is the harm of all this ?' ' Oh!' he replied,' the Khan is a scoun- ' drel, by G—d! for the plan is, that whilst we are ' supping with him in the town, our baggage is to Iolxii PRELIMINARY MATTER. « be plundered without it.'—' Are you sure of this ?' said I. ' O yes ! I saw a person who for- '&lt; nierly lived servant with you at 15ussorah, who is ' now much about the Khan, and he desiied me to ' communicate this to you.'—' He may lie, re plied I: 'we had better obtain further information, &lt;e before coming to any resolution as to the manner « in which to proceed.' The merchant said he could trust his muleteer, who had seived him long and faithfully, and who was a very cle\ ei, sensible, resolute fellow. It was agreed, theietoie, that this person should go into the city, and see what lie could pick up. About four in the evening, the muleteer came back, and gave us such information as caused us to hold a council of war, consisting oi the merchant, the muleteer, and myself; at which it was resolved, that the Khan should not be unde ceived as to our intention of supping with him, but that we would have every thing ready to make a start as soon as it was fairly dark. This was per formed to the letter; and we left the Khan to expect his guests, but to find them where he could. Having travelled safely over the Plain ol Kaze- roon, we entered the narrow pass between it aini the Plain of Kemaredge : this pass extends, accord ing to my best recollection, more than a mile and a half, and the precipices forming it, on each side, in some places nearly unite : the road in some parts winds through the bottom, and sometimes passes over the hills which present themselves on the right hand as you leave the Plain of Kazeroon. As soon as our little caravan and troop had fairly en tered the road where it lay at the bottom of thePRELIMINARY MATTER. gorge, a shot was fired from the heights; and 1 had scarcely heard this, when the rattling of mus ketry commenced all along the remaining part of the pass, and every now and then a ball struck against a yekdoon or trunk. At the time this began, I was in the rear, with a groom leading Mirza Bazurg's beautiful sorrel horse. We, how ever, soon joined the main body; which was in tolerable confusion, some for going back, some for going on : but I found the merchant's muleteer took the command of the whole in great style. ' Let no man,' said he, ' stop to answer a shot; ' keep all together; make as much noise as you ' can, and put the beasts to the utmost of their ' speed: the instant we reach the Plain of Kema- ' redge, we are safe; we are then in Zal Khan's ' country.' It was bright moonlight, and in going along we could every now and then discover a black speck amongst the rocks; and this discovery was scarcely made, before the flash of powder was perceived, and the whizzing of a bullet heard. Bullets at one time fell thick and fast; but my whole concern was about Mirza Bazurg's sorrel horse ; and strange to say, though I was greatly alarmed lest a bullet should strike and disable him, it never entered into my head it was equally probable that a bullet might strike and disable me. I never remember, in any instance of my life, to have suffered so complete an absorption of mind in one object. After this entertainment had lasted about half an hour, we debouched into the Plain of Kemaredge; a ncl our commanding officer ordered a halt, for the 12c l x i v preliminary matter. purpose of procuring a return ol the killed and wounded. This return contained—killed, none; wounded, a mule, not dangerously; three yekdoons or trunks, surface wounds. On expressing my surprise to the muleteer at the very favourable contents of this return, considering the very sharp and quick fire we had gone through, I also asked him if he could account for it. He said: ' In the first place, the light we are travelling ' by is very deceitful: in the next place, a noise ' made in this pass is very strangely echoed; and ' I have no doubt, therefore, that some ot the noises ' we made, appeared to our enemies to come fiom ' behind them, and no man shoots very steadily when ' he thinks there is somebody behind him to return ' the shot: but the principal cause of our good for- « tune is this ; the fellows placed to intercept us use ' matchlocks, which are commonly some time m ' taking fire after the match is conveyed to the pan, ' so that, as we were moving pretty fast, we ha ' got out of the aim taken before the piece was dis- ' charged.' This appeared to me a very rationa method of accounting for our having escaped so we 1. On arriving in the Plain of Kemaredge, inte ■ gence, to my great joy, was brought, that the king had the day before arrived in the Plain oi Kesht, which we also reached early in the evening. e pitched our little encampment about a mile and a half from the village or hamlet of Kesht; and I sent to Zal Khan, to inform him of my arrival, and o beg that it might be made known to the king, was not long before I received a message from his ma jesty, desiring me to come to him as soon as possi) e-PRELIMINARY MATTER. clxv I found the king sitting on a horse-cloth, under the commonest small thin tent, having his saddle, and a sort of portmanteau, placed against the pole of the tent, to support his back ; his bridle, his sword, pistols, spear, and a carbine I had given him, lying by his side; and in front of the little tent his favourite and renowned horse, Keraun, was picketted. I once had made a note of our conversation—it has been lost. I now write from memory; and if any fact of my life is faithfully imprinted on it, that fact is this interview with fallen majesty. The front of the tent was open; and as I ap proached it, I made, at a distance, an obeisance to the king. I saw him, in return, shake his head, and beckon to me to proceed. When I came fairly under the tent, though he still kept his seat, he put out his hand; which I was going to kiss, when, to my great surprise, he caught hold of my hand, and shook it; saying, ' They tell me this is the way, in your country, in which friends greet each other. Bensheen,' i.e. ' sit down.' Now there was no other place to sit down, but either on the damp ground^ or on a part of the horse-cloth on which the king sat. His majesty perceived I was embarrassed; and said, with quickness: ' Do not think I would ask ' you to sit on the ground : come and sit by me, for ' I have much to say to you, and I regard you as ' one of my steadiest friends.' His majesty then ran on with the following questions, without wait ing a reply from me as they were put:—' Do you ' know any thing of my family ? Did you see ' Khosrou, my son, before you left Shiraz ? How ' is Lala ?' i, e. Mirza Husain. ' What do thedxvi preliminary matter. ' people of Shiraz say of me ? Do they wish me ' amongst them again ?' As soon as the king paused, I told him that Mirza Husain had commissioned me to give him informa tion on all these pointsThat the royal haram was as yet treated with great respect, but strictly watched;—that his son was not suffered to go out of the citadel, and therefore neither the Mirza nor myself had seen him lately ;—that Mirza Husain ^as literally, and not figuratively, broken -hearted;—that ballads* in praise of his majesty's valour, courage, * Mr. Scott Waring, in his ' Tour to Shiraz,' has given a copy of the first BaUad which appeared at Shiraz after it was known that Lutf Aly was not made away with in the camp near Khomsha; and has added: ' This song, like an English Ballad, has more ' rhyme than sense, which has often obliged me to guess at t ic ' meaning.' I hope I shall be excused, if I trouble the reader with the version of this Ballad, as sent to me by Mirza Bazurg; and which 1 have much reason to believe was the production of Mirza Muhamme Husain, his uncle, who, as I have already said, was a poet of [?rea merit; and therefore I shall be disappointed if what I now presen is not esteemed to possess both sense and poetry.

' was possible for them to do ; and yet, in the most ' important events of their lives and mine, they, ' like myself, preferred adopting the advice of some ' false knave, to following his wise and salutary ' councils. When my grandfather came up to ' Shiraz from Bussorah, Mirza Husain besought him, ' on his knees, to put the Vakeel's son, Abdul Faty ' Khan, on the throne, and keep the power of the ' State in his own hands, under the title of Guardian. ' My grandfather seized Abdul Faty Khan, deprived ' him of sight, and proclaimed himself king: this ' cost my grandfather his life. My father, when ' he imprisoned Syed Murad Khan and Hajy Aly ' Kuly, was advised by Lala to turn out of the ' haram the women who had formerly belonged to ' Syed Murad : this advice was not followed; and ' it cost my father his life. Before I marched to- ' wards Isfahan, Mirza Husain disclosed to me, in ' a manner I could not doubt, the designs of Hajy ' Ibrahim: he repeatedly begged of me to take ^ measures for my own security : he pushed this so ' far, as to displease me: I neglected his advice; ' and at this moment the neglect of it has cost me ' the throne. Is not this Fate ?' I replied: ' Whilst your majesty is alive, the throne is yours.' ' True, true! yes, yes! but my ' present throne is Keraun's back; and my State, ' what you see here.

' By G—d ' (z. e. Wullah),' said the king, ' he is a glorious ' suvar {i.e. horseman)! It would have done your ' heart good to have seen him, the other day, spit- ' ting, on his spear, those pigs of fellows, the Dush- ' tistanees! Is not Bender Reeg a better port than ' Bushire ?' I said, ' I was afraid it was not.' ' I am sorry, very sorry for it!' replied the king.

I was in the khdvoat ' or private tent; and before any one could be ' aware, I got outside the perdahs. My first idea ' was, that we had suffered a night-surprise from ' the Kajars: and, in this persuasion, proceeding on ' foot to that part where the noise of voices was ' loudest and of musketry the quickest, I found ' myself in a crowd, in which I heard a voice calling ' out, ' Where is the king V This voice I soon re- ' cognised for that of Zal Khan; and I heard him ' say to a person near,' The scoundrels have got ' into the royal tents, but they have missed their ' prize.' Hearing this, I said, ' What is the matter, ' Zal Khan ? Are the Kajars come ? Is Muhammed ' the Eunuch with them V 'No, please your ma- ' jesty: Hajy Ibrahim has made himself master of ' Shiraz: the force under the command of his bro- ' thers has mutinied, and proceeded towards the ' royal tents to seize your majesty, and the camp ' has become a scene of plunder and confusion.' ' I then said, ' Let us try to get at our horses: let ' us draw aside a little out of the camp; and wait ' there until the morning breaks, when we shall ' distinguish friends from foes, and so be better ' able to judge in what manner to act.'

The dawn enabled us to discover that the army had dispersed; that several Feroshes were em ployed in packing up the royal tents, which I afterwards found much riddled with musket-balls; and that there were stragglers, plundering where they could. I soon collected from 3 to 400 men about me; made with them a short march towards Shiraz; and the next day I was joined by several corps of the army, and by Lala and Mirza Bazurg. I then proceeded rapidly towards Shiraz; but on the way I was informed, by some fugitives, or rather exiles from the city, of Ber- kordar's folly in visiting Hajy Ibrahim, by which egregious mistake he had gotten possession of the citadel as well as the city. ' I had been joined on the way by the camel- guns, and these I determined should announce to the citizens of Shiraz my arrival in its neighbour hood. I dare say you heard the report of them. 1 was, for some time, in daily hopes that my friends within the walls would assist in opening me a way into the city; little knowing how care fully Hajy Ibrahim had contrived to deprive them of all means of doing so. Although I began to straiten the city in provisions, it was not to such extent as to produce a serious impression: part of my force became impatient: and it was at this moment that Hajy Ibrahim contrived to have letters delivered to several chiefs, threatening to make their wives and families in Shiraz answerable, if they rendered me further assistance. TheyClxxiv PRELIMINARY MATTER. ' brought these letters to me; and candidly said, ' as it did not appear we were likely to regain the ' city at present, they could not think ot subjecting t&lt; their wives and children to the harsh and ciucl « treatment threatened by Hajy Ibrahim; at the ' same time declaring, that should an opportunity offer, they would serve me as faithfully as ever: « and Lala and Mirza Bazurg refused to return ' into the city, until I absolutely forced them to ' leave me. ' When the camp broke up, my intention was &lt;e to proceed to Bushire, to pass a part ot the wintei ' there, and obtain what assistance I could from ' Shaikh Nassir. At each Raiedaree*, myself and ' my servants had to fight through them, until we ' arrived in the Plain of Kazeroon. Raza Kuly ' Khan, the governor, had pledged himselt to Hajy ' Ibrahim either to capture or kill me ; so that ' almost as soon as we were fairly got into the plain, we had a pretty smart affair with the Kaze- ' roonees; and it would have been much more sc- ' rious, had not Raza Kuly been a famous coward. 'We were 20, they were about 4 or 500; however, ' to their great astonishment, instead of flying, ' along the direct road, out of the Plain of Kazeroon, ' where an ambush had been placed, we took a ' course direct for the abrupt and precipitous moun- ' tains which bound the plain to the eastward and ' southward.

Aye, children), we must turn ' round and fight it out.' Before our enemies, how- ' ever, came up with us, we discovered the path of a ' shotter\; and dismounting, after stripping them of ' their nummuds, left all the horses behind us at ' the bottom of the mountain, except Keraun. We ' secured these nummuds, for the purpose of pass- ' ing Keraun over such parts of the mountain as ' presented so bold and slippery a path, that a ' horse could not have stood on his legs without a ' soft surface being laid on the slanting rocks. No ' horse but Keraun could have achieved the task of ' passing over these almost precipitous paths; and ' sometimes we had even to lay him down on the ' nummuds, which he suffered as quietly as a lamb, ' and we then drew him up by main force. The ' Kazeroonees had not the courage to follow us on ' foot, and on horseback they had not the power: ' however, they took possession of nearly thirty ' beautiful horses. ' After incredible fatigue, we got down into the '' Dushtistan. Zal Khan, whilst I was encamped in ' the neighbourhood of Shiraz, had, by my desire, ' gone to his own government of Khest: as soon ' as he heard of my escape from the affray at ' Kazeroon, he sent men and horses to meet me; ' and with them I proceeded, where, as I told you ' before, I had hoped to find assistance. I wa s ' soon joined by that brave fellow Mihr Aly, from ' Bender Reeg: and Shaikh Nassir, who had come ' out to make me captive, was glad to escape with t A foot-messeng'er.PRELIMINARY MATTER. ' his life. Mihr Aly has afforded me every assist- « ance in his power; and the day before yesterday ' I ascended to Khest, after giving the Dushtistanees ' a good thrashing. Zal Khan and I are now col- ' lecting a force, wherewith to return to Shiraz; and ' Raza Knly Khan has placed troops in the Teng-e- ' Turkoon. But, Maashalla! ' (i .e. God willing!)— here his majesty abruptly stoppedand I told him what had happened to us in the Teng-e-Turkoon, and also that I had not seen any troops at Kazeroon. It was now getting late; and the king said: ' I will not ask you to eat with me, because supper ' and lodging are prepared for you in Khest, where ' you will be more comfortable; but come to- ' morrow early to me; for we have been doing ' nothing this evening but telling tales, instead ot ' talking on business, as I wished to do.' On going to the village of Khest, I found Zal Khan ready to receive me; and he gave me a hearty welcome, at the same time asking if I had forgotten the quarrel we had about a fowling-piece the first time I was at Shiraz. Here I found also my com panion and friend, the merchant, very comfortably seated; to whom Zal Khan had related many of the particulars of his majesty's escape, just as I had heard them from his own mouth. We all agreed that the king was a most extraordinary per son ; and Zal Khan almost prophetically exclaimed, ' It will never be the good fortune ol Persia to see him again on the throne! ' My companion and myself had a very large hand some divan or room, open in front, or occasional!}PRELIMINARY MATTER. clxxvii closed by a perdah or curtain, appropriated to us to sleep in, and excellent mattresses and coverlids. Just as the day broke, however, we experienced two severe shocks of an earthquake; the last of which brought down the corner of the room most distant from us. I believe there is no peril in which man can be placed, where he so sud denly and completely becomes sensible of his own helplessness, as in that of an earthquake; and I have frequently observed, from their conduct, that the same sensation appears to prevail amongst animals. Such disasters are frequent at Khest; so that, perhaps, our host did not think so much of this adventure as we did. After breakfast, I waited on the king; who, after some trifling conversation about the earthquake, said: ' Tell me candidly your opinion as to the prospect I have of recovering Shiraz.' I replied: ' I was afraid my opinion on that subject would ' be little satisfactory to him, being convinced, that, ' unless he received assistance from within the city, ' it would be very difficult, not to say impossible ' for him, without battering artillery or mortars, ' to obtain possession of it. That having already ' mentioned how little probable it was that he ' should receive such assistance, it was my opinion ' that unless an insurrection took place, and Hajy Ibrahim was seized, or the guards at one of the ' gates betrayed their trust, his present means and ' preparations were totally incompetent to the ' object. Besides, whenever he sat down before ' the city, Aga Muhammed Khan would immedi- ' ately come to its relief; and then he must either mclxxviii preliminary matter. ' retreat or give battle, which last he was not yet ' strong enough to do.' The king remained thoughtful for some time; and then said . Tdl me what you would do, were you in my place. ' I am not without resources. 1 have with me ' those things you saw at Shiraz, and se^seial ' others.' I told his majesty, that the subject on which he now asked my opinion was one ot sucii magnitude and importance, one so very unlike any thing I had been accustomed to employ and exercise ni} thoughts on, that probably the opinion I should give would be of little value i though, as he had asked me for it, I would deliver it most frankly; and that if any part of it were adopted in which my services could be useful, they were perfectly at his majesty's command. I began thus :— ' It appears to me, the first aim of your majesty ' should be, to fix on some place to which, in case ' of defeat, you can retire with security; where ' every thing for a future trial may be prepared; ' where stores and ammunition may be collected and •' placed in safety; and where a rallying-point may ' be formed for your friends and those who continue ' faithful. Little as I know of such matters, 1 ' know enough, however, to assure your majesty, ' that, at a small expense, Bushire can be rendered ' strong enough to defy any force the Kajar can ' bring against it; though, as long as your majesty ' continues to possess the passes from Khotel Peer- e-zun to Dowlakie, the Kajar cannot easily ap- ' proach that town. I am aware how essential it is ' to your interest that no time should be lost mPRELIMINARY MATTEK. dxxix ' punishing Razci Kuly Khan, and in obtaining pos- ' session of the passes of the Khotels of Dokhter ' and Peer-e-zun; but that accomplished, I consider ' your majesty will do better in retracing your steps ' and taking possession of Bushire, than proceeding ' in your present condition towards Shiraz.' The king interrupted me, and said: ' He considered Bushire as being a place of no strength.' I an swered : ' I was not at all surprised at this ; because ' I had observed it to be a general opinion through- ' out Persia, that provided a town was surrounded ' with a very high wall, and even a dry ditch, it ' was considered an exceedingly strong place, ' though there might be localities in the neighbour- ' hood which entirely counterbalanced these advan- ' tages. I do assure your majesty,' continued I, that if an European enemy were to appear before ' Shiraz, I think they would scarcely put them- ' selves to the trouble of opening trenches before it. \our majesty will please to recollect, there ' are three sides of the town of Bushire which can ' only be attacked by sea, and therefore inacces sible to the Kajars; that the land side presents ' no very long line to defend ; and I deceive myself ' much, if a deep wet ditch may not be excavated nil along this line. In short, I am convinced, an ' engineer, in a short time, might render Bushire so stiong, as to put the Kajar, and the most powerful ' army he could bring, at complete defiance. Once &lt;f established there, your majesty might open a com munication with the British Government in India; leading, probably, to great and eventful results. I he trade of Bushire is on the increase: vour tn 2dxXX PRELIMINARY MATTER. ' majesty's residence there, tor some time, would ' probably be the means of greatly extending it. ' The Dushtistan supplies considerable quantities ' of grain : more might be imported from Bussorah, ' India, and other places; and the regular customs ' of the port of Bushire would from time to time « afford no unseasonable supply of money. A depot ' of ammunition and all warlike stores might easily ' be formed there; and by degrees your majestys ' forces and means might be so augmented, as to ' enable you to meet your potent adversary in the ' field, with a reasonable chance of success; for it ' is in the field, and the field only, that Shiraz is &lt;* now to be won back. One glorious day, the arm al ' of which your valour leaves no doubt, will put ' every thing in your power. I therefore venture « confidently to think it would be preferable to ' consume a year or two in such preparations as 1 ' have hinted, than to continue making attacks on ' Shiraz, which are not likely to be effective. ' Besides, I am confident Hajy Ibrahim has no ' intention of delivering Shiraz to the Kajars, unless ' he is constrained to do so; and one sure means ' of forcing on him such a measure, will be your ' majesty's continuing to make teazing attacks on ' it. As long as the southern provinces ol the ' kingdom have any government capable of afford- ' ing them tolerable prospect of protection, they ' will not submit to the Kajar.' His majesty heard me with great patience and attention, and allowed that what I had proposed deserved serious consideration. Zal Khan was now called in, and the scheme was discussed with him.PRELIMINARY MATTER. clxxxi He, however, did not appear to view it in the same light that I did; and I saw at once that the king was more inclined to trust to his own courage and activity, than to a soberer and more certain line of conduct. However, many years after, I had the satisfaction of hearing Mirza Bazurg say to me : ' If ' Lutf Aly Khan had followed the advice you gave ' him at Khest, I should probably be at this instant ' at Shiraz, instead of being, as I am, at Tauris; and he would now have been on the throne, in- ' stead of having lost his life in the most cruel and ' ignominious manner.' The king shortly afterwards abruptly said : ' How long do you intend to remain at Bender Reeg?' and then, before I could reply, added : ' I have em ployment for youat the same time pulling out, from a concealed pocket in his dress, a blue cord, to which were attached many loops, such as men in office in Persia use, to carry their seals; but to these loops, instead of seals, were fastened a considerable number of rings; as near as I remember, from twelve to fourteen : the stones in these rings were all diamonds of different sizes; and amongst them was the famous yellow diamond given to, or rather taken by.

You know you came up to Shiraz to ' buy the Dereya-noor. It is impossible I can do tt without money.' I was so thunderstiuck with the king's proposal, that, not making an immediate answer, he hastily said: 'Well! what are you about ? what do you say?' I replied : ' If your ' majesty will adopt the project I offered ioi your ' consideration, of establishing yourself at Bushhe, ' I will attend your majesty there, on your return ' from Kazeroon; and I will from thence accom- ' pany to India any person you may appoint, eithei ' to pledge or sell such part of these jewels as you ' may direct; for it is quite certain, in the present ' state of things, no Persian merchant will venture majesty,' replied the Mlrza. ' No,' said the Mogul, indignantly; ' I kept the rarest jewel in the world for the person who is writing ' the Life of the greatest Sovereign in it.' Nadir was please vut the compliment; but, nevertheless, took the jewel from the secre tary. I have great reason to believe the present king c oes no possess this magnificent stone; because, when I was last in trsl j i ' and had an order to see all the crown jewels, it was not amongs them; and because, when I afterwards spoke to the king on subject, he pulled out of his bosom a very inferior jewel, of ditteren size, cut, and colour, and shewed it to me for Nadir's diamon . mentioned this afterwards to Mirza Bazurg; and he said: &gt; 0 ' bless you! tell the king this is the same stone you saw at Khes, ' otherwise he will vex about it sadly.'

The king said : ' Aye! that is the reason I wish, at all ' events, to get them out of Persia; for I cannot ' bear the idea of their becoming the property of ' the Kajar; and Lala has given me such a charac- '• ter of you, that I will willingly entrust them to ' you, until something can be settled.' It is im- ' possible for me,' replied I, ' to receive so great ' a mark ot your majesty's confidence, however ' greatly I may feel gratified by your proposing it: ' in the first place, it is absolutely necessary that I ' should proceed to Bussorah, before I can return ' to India; and where, during the time I stay there, ' can I place such a treasure in safety ? It would ' be a great act of folly and imprudence in me to ic'cei\ e these articles from your majesty, and carry ' them about with me ; for in that case, from anxiety/ u or some other cause, it might be as much as my ' life was worth : besides, such conduct would merit ' the just censure of my superiors.' I then told his majesty I had not more with me, in money, than 500 piastres, which was barely sufficient to defray my expenses from Khest to Bussorah ; but that I had with me a considerable property in gold and silver plate, small diamonds, and shawls, all of which were at his majesty's service. ' For the purpose I ' want,' said the king, your wares are no better ' than my own ; and though your companion from ' Shiraz, the merchant Ibrahim, may have money f with him, I will neither take it from him, nor force him to lend it to me; for I will employ no meansclxxxiv PRELIMINARY MATTER. ' for my restoration but such as are perfectly halaul ' (lawful).' He then said : Tell me what I shall do.'—'After your expedition against Kazeroon,' ' replied I, establish yourself, as I have before ' ventured to recommend, at Bushire : when there, ' open a communication with the British Govern- ' ment in India; send such of the jewels, as you are ' willing to part with, there, and either sell them or ' raise money on them : all this will be regular, ' and, for my own part, I believe not very difficult ' to execute. If in this scheme your majesty should ' chuse to employ me, I promise your majesty to ' be at Bushire by the middle or end of January: ' I will then go on to India, with any one your ' majesty may please to appoint; and I see no &lt;&lt; reason why, at the end of six months, I might ' not rejoin your majesty with such stores and am- ' munition as you may direct your agent and myself ' to purchase there.' The king said: ** Wallah! (i.e. ' by G—d!) you counsel well. As soon as I have ' chastised RazaKuly Khan, I will return to Bushire; ' and I desire of you to join me there as soon as you possibly can : lose no time now at Bender ' Reeg; settle all your affairs as soon as you can. ' You may tell Mihr Aly, in confidence, all that has ' passed between us in respect to Bushire; and ' that I expect he will be ready to give me such ' assistance as I may require, in the execution of ' the project.' At this moment, the king's chaust, or dinner, was brought in, and I got up to withdraw; when, to my surprise, he said: 'You have lived long enough in ' Arabia to know what eating salt together 'means:PRELIMINARY MATTER. clxxxv ' are you willing to undertake that engagement ' with me* ? If so, Bismillah/ {i.e. in the name of ' God!)' His majesty then gave me a skewer of the kabob, or roast meat, that was now placed before him, and a piece of the app, or flat bread. After the meal was over, his majesty said: ' My mind is ' much easier: yours is a rational scheme ; and if ' I could only get Lala and Mirza Bazurg out of ' Shiraz, we shall still do well. Make all the haste ' you can to Bussorah: settle your affairs. Zal ' Khan shall give you a strong guard, till you ' reach Mihr Aly's country and taking a beautiful turquoise ring from his own finger, he placed it on mine; saying, at the same time: ' This will re- ' mind you we have eaten salt together, and that ' you are engaged to me.—God be with you!' Alas! I never again beheld this noble, brave, gene rous, but most unhappy and unfortunate prince! The reader will perhaps pardon me, if on this subject I detain him one moment longer, and com municate to him what made a strong impression on me at the time. It was, that, during the whole of this conversation, not one word of useless com plaint, not one word of abuse, not one opprobrious appellation, in respect to Hajy Ibrahim, escaped the lips of his majesty: but when he spoke of Mirza Husain, his eyes were full of tears; and when he spoke of his family, those tears flowed apace. With a strong guard, I commenced my journey down the mountains, at midnight: and perhaps the reader may participate in the sorrow I still feel, * One of them is, to defend the person with whom you have so eaten, to the extent of your life and fortune.clxxxvi preliminary matter. when I tell him, that, in pulling off my glove, in the course of the journey, the turquoise ring I had re ceived from the king, the setting of which was too large for my finger, dropped from it; and as 1 did not happen to miss it at the time, 1 never aftei \\ ards recovered it, though I staid at Bender Reeg pm- posely to enable persons, sent by Mihr Aly, to search for it. The Persians are superstitious; and Mihr Aly, when all hope of the recovery of the ling was given up, said to me, at parting: ' Ihe kings lor- ' tunes and yours are for ever separated ; and last ' night I had notice, which I cannot mistake, that « I am to be equally unfortunate.'—I am not ashamed to confess, that the loss ol the ring, and the governor's prediction, which was but too lite rally verified, caused me great uneasiness. I now proceed with the remaining sorrowful ad ventures and misfortunes of the king. In a few days after my departure, the king commenced his march from Khest towards Kazeroon and Shiraz. In the entrance to the Plain of Kazeroon he came to action with Raza Kuly Khan. Ihe result ot such a meeting may be easily anticipatedhis ma jesty captured his opponent; deprived him ol sight; recovered the beautiful horses he had been obliged to abandon when retiring to the Dushtistan; and, full of spirits and hope, proceeded towards Shiraz, in the vicinity of which city he shortly after encamped. The inhabitants soon found themselves straitened for provisions; and the scarcity was increased by his majesty capturing a large quantity of grain and other articles, under the charge ot Mustafa Khan,PRELIMINARY MATTER. clxxxvii who had been despatched out of Shiraz, by Hajy Ibrahim, to collect them. Subsequently to this, Hajy Ibrahim, with what force he had within the walls, made an attack on the king's position, which was defeated; and measures were carrying on within the fort, which, if they had not been prematurely discovered, and disclosed to Hajy Ibrahim, would probably have restored the king to his family, his throne, and his friends. A part of this plan was, that the king should withdraw from his position in the vicinity of the city, in order that Hajy Ibrahim might therefore become less vigilant, and the conspirators possess greater facility of putting their plans into execution. His majesty, therefore, retired from the position he occupied. But the knowledge Hajy Ibrahim had now acquired of the temper and designs of the in habitants of Shiraz convinced him that the execu tion of his original scheme of a federative govern ment was impracticable; and that his own safety- depended on the early arrival of the Kajar, to whom he basely determined to deliver the city. He therefore seriously, and ardently, besought Aga Muhammed Khan to hasten his march to wards Shiraz. The request was well received, and promptly acted on; but not without presenting Lutf Aly with an opportunity of manifesting acts of astonishing valour and military skill. By means of a very strong advanced guard, Aga Muhannned had, as he thought, secured the narrow pass which, com ing from Isfahan, leads into the Plain of Persepolis ; and had encamped himself, with a very large force, at a place a little distance from the pass called- 7^ I'O? ■ • -r- .. 7 clxXXviii PRELIMINARY MATTER. Giruj. The great superiority, in numbers, of the main body of the Kajar army; the strength of the position occupied by the advanced guard; and the distance from his camp at which the king's force was supposed to be, as well as the smallness of it, produced a perfect security in Aga Muhammed Khan's mind, that no sudden attack could be made on him by his enemy. This state of his enemy, however, became known to the king; and by a forced march, to which there is no parallel known in Persia, he contrived to arrive at the Pass of Persepolis about the time his enemies were engaged at supper. To arrive, to attack the post, to carry it, to push on towards the main body of the enemy, and, after a very bloody resistance, to become master of his camp, were events which succeeded each other as rapidly as possible. Opposition to the victor had now nearly ceased, and Aga Muhammed Khan was reported to have fled: in an evil moment, Mirza Faty Aly approached his master, and besought him to rest on his arms until the day broke. The king was the more in clined to adopt this treacherous advice, because, what between the length of the march and the combats in which his troops and himself had en gaged at the end of it, both he and they required a short repose; and because he had already heard the military band, or nokara khaneh, of the enemy, greet him as conqueror and sovereign of Persia. The morning at length broke — a morning ol sorrow, disappointment, and grief, to the king; fo r ) as the light appeared, he discovered that AgaPRELIMINARY MATTER. clxxxix Muhammed was on the ground at the extremity of his camp, and that his dispersed troops were rallying from all quarters. The king's forces, not recovered from six and thirty hours of unceasing fatigue either of march or battle, and bearing proportion to the enemy as one to twenty, were in no condition to renew the attack : his majesty, therefore, drew his little band of heroes into a small compact body, and sullenly and slowly moved off the ground. The eunuch made no effort to interrupt him; and he wisely rebuked those who, in flattery, endeavoured to persuade him his enemy would become an easy prey, by saying : ' Never attack a hungry lion, when he is inclined to remove from you.' The events of this fatal night put an end to the king's hopes of rescuing Shiraz from the grasp of the Kajar, who now moved forward without further impediment. As he approached the ill-fated city, the traitor met him at a distance, presenting him with the keys of the gates and fortress ; and delivered, at the same time, his master's family and treasures, and the lives and honour of his former fellow-citi zens, to the will of a ruthless tyrant; who is reported to have said to Hajy Ibrahim, on the occasion: ' I have, in the course of my life, witnessed three ' events more than commonly remarkable; that is ' to say. The magnitude and blackness of your ' treachery, Hajy Ibrahim ; Lutf Aly Khan's intre- ' P^ity, in his attack on my advanced guard at the ' Pass of Persepolis, and on myself and main body ' at Giruj ; and my own firmness, when all was ' apparently lost, in remaining on the ground until ' morning dawned.' We must admit it would be impossible to surpass the villany of the first; thecxc PRELIMINARY MATTER. bravery of the second was never excelled; but to the merit claimed by the eunuch for the third, there is a considerable drawback ; namely, that he was in communication with the traitor Mirza Faty Aly; and that the striking up of the Kajar band, and their salutation of victory, which principally deceived the unfortunate king as to his real position, was in consequence of a message conveyed to the eunuch to that effect, when the Mirza informed him the poisonous counsel which he had given his master, of resting on his arms until morning, had been adopted. I have no wish to detail the horrible transactions which succeeded at Shiraz: but it is right to men tion, that the first person the victor ordered to be brought before him was the ex-minister, Mirza Muhammed Husain ; and that the first question he put to him was, what had become of his books. The reply was : ' They are here, my lord, for your use.' To this was answered : ' It is well it is so; ' for had you sent them out of Persia with the ' Fringee who came to purchase the diamonds, the ' life of yourself, and every member of your family, ' should have paid for it; and my arm would have ' been long enough even to have inflicted punish- ' ment on him who had had the audacity to take ' charge of them and carry them away.' This anecdote I received from Mirza Bazurg, when we met in 1B09; who told me he was present when the conversation took place. I will not travel through the account of a series of the most heroic and unfortunate attempts made by the king to re-establish his fortunes, but hasten to relieve my mind from the sorrow and regretPRELIMINARY MATTER. CXC1 which, even after this length of time, it feels for the fate and misfortunes of Lntf Aly Khan. At a little distance from Kerman, which the king had defended with his natural and usual gallantry, Keraun and his master fell together—the noble horse, hamstrung by a cowardly villain ; the king, covered with a mul titude of wounds, but unfortunately none mortal, inflicted on his person by a number of assailants. In this state he was captured, and borne before the Kajar; who, on receiving from the fallen monarch an answer full of dignity and truth, ordered him to be instantly deprived of sight, and his person to be treated in a manner too horrible to mention. The remaining days of this great prince were few and sad; but Persia, even now, speaks of his heroic actions with pride; and the inhabitants of the southern parts of the empire retain an affectionate and respectful regard for his memory and virtues. For many months after my return to Bussorah, I continued in regular correspondence with the king; and every letter, until the fatal business of Giruj, spoke of the next, desiring me to join him as soon as possible. With the fall and life of Lutf Aly ended the power of the Zends; and with the elevation of Aga Muhammed Khan commenced the dynasty of the Kajars. The justice of Heaven, however, as the reader will see, overtook, in due time, Hajy Ibrahim; and the scoundrel and his abettors—I mean his worth less profligate brothers, as well as many other members of his family—were made to feel some of the miseries they had brought on their king, their townsmen, and numbers of innocent families. —I now launch my feeble bark on the uncertain sea of public opinion.

The information derived from the careful perusal of Biography and History, and the Traditions handed down from the successive generations of the Turkomans of Kipchak* acquaint us, that the noble tribe of the Kajars, forming a part of the body of the Eel and Alous in the regions of 'I ur hist an, had long spent their lives happily, pass ing the summers amongst the pasturages of the mountains, and descending in the winter to the southern plains of those delightful countries. The commencement of their power begins with a family of five brothers, who were uniformly ambitious of greatness and elevation, and who attained celebrity 111 ^ a ^ es and daring exploits. On account of their , vvor ^ s printed in Italics are referred to and explained in e 1 otes, in the Appendix. n2 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. inbred valour and innate magnanimity, every one, without premeditation, exclaimed, agreeably to the purport of this tetrastich : 'We Five Brothers spring from one root: ' We are the five fingers in the hand of Fortune: ' When erect, we form the standards of victory; ' When collected, we intiict blows on the faces of our enemies.' The eldest brother was named Kajar Khan; and his tribe, the Kajar Khani; just as the Seljuk Turks are called Seljuki, after the name of Seljuk Beg; and the Oguz Khan are called the Oguz Khani: so (the tribes of) Jengheez Khan and Jagt'ai are called the Jengheez Khani and the Jagtayi; the Begdali Khan, the Begdali; and the Afshars are so named after Afshar Khan, the fourth son of Oguz Khan. At the period of Oguz Khan's invasion from Turkistan, for the purpose of subduing Persia, this j tribe served under his orders, and formed part of his army; so that, in the course of time, their abode, and summer and winter cantonments, were fixed in the districts of Diarhekr and Erldt. On the return of Oguz into Turkistan, this tribe, in consequence of the connexions and relations which they had formed, turned their views to a residence in these regions; and, for successive generations, maintained themselves there by heroism and mag- ; nanimity, and continued unshaken in authority | and dominion. In the reign of Sultan Hasan Beg, the Turkoman, they proceeded from Diarbekr to Azarbdijan. During his reign, and the reigns of Sultan Yakub and Alwand Mirza, their nobles and chieftains were Governors in most of the cities of Azarba'ijan, Irak, and Fars. When the power |DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 3 came to Shah Ismail of the Sefavi Dynasty, his great Dignitaries were mostly taken from this distinguished tribe of the Kajars. On the decease of Shah Ismail, when his successor Shah Tahmasp Sefavi was fixed on the throne, the distinctions of heroism and dignity were, according to former pre cedents, conferred on this illustrious tribe ; so that on every side, in all the realms of Iran, they enjoyed the supreme dignity, and were held in honour for their authority and equitable government. When the succession fell to Shah Abbas, he, becoming alarmed at their numbers and eminence, broke up the compact mass of their population into several divisions. Under the pretence 'that this tribe is 'celebrated for bravery and intrepidity, and justly f famed for energy in defensive war,' he removed a numerous body to Shahijahan, and placed them opposite the L zbegs: another body of them was settled in Ganja and Irevan, and commanded to de- Ifnd the countries bordering on Room: he fixed another body at Asterabad, opposite to the Turko mans, and charged them with the defence of the passes of Asterabad. Ihe royal genealogy of the sovereign, the Sub- duer of the Universe, is traced to Ka-An-Lu, the son of Jengheez Khan. The Prince's family is styled Ka-An-Lu; as one of his ancestors had received in maniage the daughter of Kaan, son of Jengheez Khan: for this reason they were called Ka-An -Lu. At the termination of the Sefavi Dynasty, when Mahmud the Afghan, having invaded the country horn Kandahar, besieged Shah Sultan Husain in h Man, and closely blockaded the Shah and his b 24 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. army, Faty Ah/ Khan Kajar, the illustrious great grandfather of our present victorious sovereign, being joined by a great number ot the nobles, ex erted himself to succour Shah Sultan Husain ; and proceeded from Asterabad to Isfahan, lor the pur pose of attacking and driving off the Afghans. He several times attacked the Afghans with great resolution : on which occasion the King's Ministers, inspired by an evil policy, thus represented to the Shah' Those brave Kajars are a warlike and ' lion-like race: Faty Aly Khan has also entered ' into the lists of those hostile to the throne, and ' has unfurled the banners of supremacy in the ' field of Fortune : in consequence of this fortitude, ' they have been always distinguished by favours ' and royal munificence : it will therefore be here- ' after a difficult matter to keep them in proper ' restraint.' Shah Sultan Husain, whose days were now blackened by misfortune, and whose future fate the hand of Calamity had overspread with gloom, ap proved of the calumnies uttered by these infatuated advisers, and manifested neither interest nor esteem in the proceedings of the Kajars; therefore the noble Faty Aly Khan, being both insulted and af flicted, returned from Isfahan to Asterabad. In a short time after, Mahmud the Afghan took Isfahan, and exhibited scenes of boundless slaughter, capti vity, and plunder : he also martyred Shah Sultan Husain. Before the capture and devastation of Isfahan, the infatuated and ignorant Ministers thought it advisable that Shah Tahmasp, son to Shah Sultan Husain, should depart from Isfahan, as byDYNASTY OF THE K A JARS. it- n, x- nd I ir- le iat rs, he ad ed nd he le, ! irs re- )er 3W ;he ip- :ed em ;he af- i a an, tan of ers lah by this measure he might procure assistance. He therefore quitted Isfahan, and the Nuwab Faty Aly Khan hastened to wait on him : he quite devoted himself to arranging the concerns of the State and settling the measures of Government, and, along with Shah Tahmasp, unfurled the exalted banner in the kingdom of Khorasan. Nadir Shah Afshar, of the Afshariyah tribe, who dwelt at Apward, and who had already taken some hostile steps and endeavoured to grasp the regal crown, also joined Shah Tahmasp. He soon disco vered that F aty Aly Khan was an obstacle to his de signs, and therefore lay in wait to disgrace and calum niate this excellent person. At last, Shah Tahmasp, having assented to the suggestions of his insane nobles, made L aty Aly Khan swallow the draught of martyrdom, on the 14th of Safar in the year 1139 (a.d . 172()). Shortly after. Nadir Shah, through his great abilities, natural sagacity, and innate talents, greatly increased his power, expelled the Afghans from Isfahan and Shiraz, and drove out the Turks from Azarba'ijan. He then obliged Shah Tahmasp to resign, and made him retire to a place of seclu sion. When he led his army to subjugate Hindu stan, his son Raza Kuly Mirza, by his order, made Shah 1 ahmasp swallow the beverage of martyrdom. Hie Nuwab Muhammed Husain Khan, the eldest son of Faty Aly Khan, becoming alarmed, after the melancholy fate of his noble father, for his own sa fety, took refuge among the Wandering Turko mans, and was thus secured against the treachery and power of Nadir Shah. When this Afshar prince, w the year of the Hejira 1160 (a.d. 1747), was hurledft DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. in the dust of destruction by the hands oi some in trepid Turks, the illustrious Muhammed Khan (mitted the Turkomans, and came to Asterabad and Mazenderan: he there collected his illustrious kinsmen and their tribes, and, being also joined by a numerous body of the noble Kajars, raised the standard of universal sway. At this period, dis cord and insurrection overspread the regions o Iran • commotion and tumult prevailed among the people. Kureem Khan and Azad Khan were mutu ally attacking each other in Irak, Furs, and Azar- ha'iiau; while Ahmed Shah Durramj unfurled the banner of supremacy in Khorasan. The Nuwab Muhammed Husain Khan, having reduced Mazen deran and Tabaristan, next turned his endeavours to the subjugation of Irak and Fars. He fought several spirited battles against Azad Khan the Afghan, and Kureem Khan Zend. When he had m several places given these two competitors consi derable defeats, he hastened from Irak into Fars with martial pomp and an army of irresistible force, and besieged Kureem Khan Zend in Shiraz. n this position of affairs, several Kajar nobles con spired to oppose his plans, and openly practised resistance and treachery : in consequence of which, this great and splendid camp was broken up an dissolved, and the Nuwab obliged to retire to Ma zenderan, where, in the year 1172 (a.d. 1758), e drank the sherbet of martyrdom, administered y the hands of two or three persons of the Kajar tribe. The occurrence of this event furnished to Kureem Khan Zend the means of attaining royalty, and he- came the cause of his elevation :!&gt;*«• dynasty of the kajars. 7 ' They removed the diadem from the head of one nation, ' And bound the royal jewels around another nation's brows.' The country of Iran was given up to him: from whence he urged on the charger of usurpation to Mazenderan and Tabaristan; and sadly afflicted Asterabad, the capital of the illustrious Kajars : with tyrannical hands he tore asunder the string of pearls, and with hostile force scattered the in valuable jewels of the armlet which graced the royal arms. Some of the bright stars which beamed in the firmament of Royal Majesty were settled at the royal residence of Kazwin : others had their abode fixed at Shiraz, the seat of learning. Kureem Khan, however, kept near his own person the Subduer of the World, the victorious Muhammed Shah ; also the mighty and triumphant HusainKuly Khan; both pearls of one shell, and the eldest sons of Muham- med Husam Khan ,* one of them, the honoured paternal uncle of his present majesty, the exalted in dignity, sublime as the heaven ; the other his munificent father. In all important affairs he sought assistance from their profound reason : they were his companions on the throne of dominion, and his confidents in the sanctuary of council. The Nuwab Husain Kuly Khan set out and proceeded to Aster abad, with the permission of Kureem Khan : during two years the charger of absolute power was obe dient to the rein, and fire flashed from his avenging sword : his father's enemies became the food of his hiilliant scimetar, and he openly opposed Kureem Khan. In one onset, he despoiled of life Muham- me d Khan Suwadi of Khoie, governor of Mazen deran on the part of Kureem Khan.8 dynasty of the kajars. As the Almighty, Glorious and Exalted, with the pen of Omnipotence decreed tranquillity in the regions inhabited by his servants in this abode of change and corruption to be effected through the existence of this Protector of the World, the standard of equity and justice, belonging to the Supreme Monarch, was displayed in the regions of Destiny, by the hands of the Celestial Agents on earth and heaven : therefore his present majesty, another Jamsheed, endowed with imperial splendor, who was called into existence by the agency of Divine Power illuminated and embellished this world by his efful gent appearance, on Wednesday night, the 18th of Suwal, in the year of the Hejira 1185 (a.d. 1771). The nurse of Wisdom suckled him with the breast of Good Fortune, and the guardian of Destiny bound on his blessed arm the amulet of sovereignty. The Reciters of Charms belonging to the angelic world, in order to avert the fascinating eye, repeated over his perfect beauty this charm:—' Had not grace ' from his Lord reached him, he had surely been ' cast forth naked on the shore ; but his Lord chose ' him, and made him one of the Righteous.' (Sale's Koran.) The Ministers employed in the courts of Fate and Power, instead of dirhems and dinars, showered down the sun and moon as presents upon his auspicious head. When it had been ascertained, by the tenor of the planetary decrees and the aspects of the propitious stars, that the child should become a shining sun in the firmament of Conquest, and the horizon of Victory should be illumined by his bright star, they conferred on this cedar of the Garden of Splendor, and on this fresh branch of the rose -bedsDYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 9 of temporal and spiritual sovereignty, the blessed name of his illustrious grandfather, Faty Aly Khan— May he repose in peace ! S When some years had thus passed, through the revolutions of the sun and moon, the Ministers of Fate, and the destroyers of the fond hopes of young and old, decreed that the existence of the Nuwab Husain Kuly Khan should be terminated through a conspiracy formed by a few Yamoot Turkomans: from grief and woe, the heart of the aged world was defiled with blood, at the inevitable calamity of this illustrious personage, on whom its most earnest hopes reposed. However, the whole horizon beamed with effulgence, through the Manucheher- like countenance of our illustrious sovereign, and the birth of a brother, who, after the martyrdom of his famed sire, advanced from the concealment of non-existence into the area of Being, and who was named after his father. 1 CHAP.

K ureem Khan Zend, having tasted the poison of dissolution from the cupbearer of Destiny, passed away on Tuesday the 13th of Safar, in the year of the Hejira 1193 ( a. d . 1779).

Contented and happy, he ascended the10 DYNASTY OF THE KAIARS. throne of prosperity and triumph, overthrew his enemies, and rendered his territories cultivated and flourishing: with the water of his blood-coloured falchion, he layed the dust raised by the partisans of tumult and revolt: by the terror of his darts, resembling falling stars, he extirpated rebellion from the dark recesses of the hearts of demon-like mortals: his avenging sword became ruby-coloured, from the blood of the sons of Kureem Khan and Nadir Shah: he wholly delivered the world from the existence of contumacious and unjust persons. CHAP. III. A SUMMARY ACCOUNT OF THE ACHIEVEMENTS PERFORMED BY THE SUN OF OENEROUS RAYS, AGA MOHAMMED KHAN ; AND OF THE VIGILANT CAUTION, AND THE RESOLUTION, RAPID AS LIGHTNING, WHICH CHARACTERIZE THIS POTENT SOVEREIGN. T he late Monarch, after the death of Kureem Khan, who detained him at Shiraz, fled with all expedition, during three days, in the direction of Isfahan, accompanied by his illustrious brothers, Jaafer Kuly Khan and Mahdy Kuly Khan, some relatives and devoted friends: from thence he pro ceeded, with the utmost speed, towards Mazenderan. At Teheran, he attached to the triumphant train Abdul Khan, the Kurd of Jahan Baglu, along with other Chieftains of the Kurds, with their tribes and families, that were settled in the districts of Reh and Isfahan. His majesty's other brothers, Mustafa Kuly Khan and Murtazy Kuly Khan, on learning at Asterabad the death of Kureem Khan, being greatly rejoiced, assembled at Mazenderan, andhis and ired 5ans irts, lion -like red, and rom )ns. the 1 THE NING, :eem i all n of liers, ;ome pro lan, train with 5 and h and istafa ruing seing and DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. I 1 posted themselves in the city of Balfrush. At first, they were greatly delighted at the intelligence of the late monarch's liberation ; but afterwards, through the corrupt suggestions of some envious persons actuated by falsehood and hostility, they arose and threw up entrenchments, to obstruct the advance of their brother, favoured by Heaven : they therefore posted a great body of troops in Saval Koh, to oppose and drive him back. In the mean time, his majesty's other brother, Raza Kuly Khan, having separated himself from the im perial train, fled to Mazenderan, and began openly to practise ingratitude. On learning this, the late monarch despatched Jaafer Kuly Khan to Mur- tazy Kuly Khan, with this message :—' If, notwith- ' standing the interval of so many years, you feel ' no wish for an interview, still the most intense ' desire of it has taken possession of us : up to this ' time, there cannot be found any conduct, pro- ' ceeding from our side, which should be the cause ' of alienation or offence, or furnish a motive for ' enmity or discussion: let us therefore beware of ' hostility and falsehood, and follow the path of ' sincerity and concord.' These counsels, how ever, proved of no use to Murtazy Kuly Khan, as he persevered in his opposition ; so that the affair ended in hostilities between the brothers, and a battle ensued. Raza Kuly Khan, having with drawn from Murtazy Kuly Khan, went to the city of Balfrush ; and the defeat of Murtazy Kuly Khan ensued. While the late monarch advanced towards Balfrush, Aly Morad Khan entertained the desire ot subjugating Mazenderan ; and by the persuasion12 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. of a number of Larijanees, who joined him, he sent against Asterabad a strong army, composed of the Zend and Lor tribes. They however, having sustained a severe defeat from the late monarch, retired to Teheran, and he became desirous of pro ceeding to Isfahan: at this moment, Raza Kuly Khan, having, through fickleness of mind, recom menced his wickedness, the late monarch detached against him Jaafer Aly Khan. At this conjunc ture, Raza Kuly Khan, being quite destitute of resources, and not being able to find a place ol se curity, once more returned to the allegiance of his exalted brother, and pledged himself never more to engage in opposition ; on which, the late monarch pardoned and overlooked his errors, and advanced for the purpose of subduing Isfahan. On arriving in the district of Teheran, he detached Jaafer Kuly Khan, with a considerable army, to Kazwin ; and in the encampment atDolah he appointed his younger brother, Mahdy Kuly Khan, to conciliate the peo ple of Larijan. After his departure, Raza Kuly Khan fled from the imperial camp, joined a nume rous body of Larijanees in Firoz-koh and Damawend, and laid anew the foundations of wickedness and sedition. The late monarch, knowing that it was of the greatest importance to repel his domestic foes, marched towards Mazenderan ; but while he halted in the vicinity of Teheran, an interview took place between Murtazy Kuly Khan and Raza Kuly Khan: they seized the passes through which Jaafer Kuly Khan was marching from Kazwin to join his brother, and defeated him: many of his train fellDYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. in the battle, but he escaped and joined his brother at Asterabad. He was detached from thence against Raza Kuly Khan, whom he defeated at Kajur; and having taken him prisoner, sent him to the royal presence. Murtazy Kuly Khan also sent to the imperial court Mustafa Kuly Khan, with a considerable number of his followers; and by this measure gave evident proofs of contrition. The late monarch went from thence to Saru, and next to Balfrush, where he halted ; he detached Jaafer Kuly Khan and Mustafa Kuly Khan to subdue Gilan; and Raza Kuly Khan was appointed to con ciliate the people of Larijan. Ihis fool once more, through fickleness of disposition and insanity of tem perament, openly displayed acts of rebellion; and at the head of an army, in the month Zilhajjah-al- Haram, in the year of the Hejira 1195 (a. d. 1780), he entered Balfrush by surprise, surrounded the royal residence, and carried his insolence to such a pitch that he took his late majesty prisoner. As soon as Jaafer Kuly Khan, Murtazy Kuly Khan, Mahdy Kuly Khan, and the other Ameers and chiefs of the Kajars, learned this painful intelli gence, they assembled their forces, and marched directly against Raza Kuly Khan. After two severe en gagements, they defeated him with great loss, and slew his associates, auxiliaries, nobles, and troops. Raza Kuly Khan then determined on flight, le tired into Irak, and joined Alim A/y Mordd Zend: he remained some time with this chief; but at last, having manifested hostile designs against him also, they separated, and he hastened to Shiraz, to Sadik14 DYNASTY OF THE KA.IARS. Khan Zend: after some time, having been dis covered plotting against him also, he fled from Shiraz to Khorasan, and died in the holy city of Meshed. In short, after the flight of Raza Kuly Khan, the late monarch conferred dignities and favours on his brothers and the other Chieftains, proportioned to their rank. Murtazy Kuly Khan, however, did not participate in the royal bounty, owing to the depravity of some calumniators; although the late monarch sent him the following message a It seems to me advisable, as we are ' brothers, that we should live in concord among ' ourselves, and should mutually support each ' other with sincerity and purity, and trample on ' our abject foes.' This message made no im pression on him; and he threw up entrenchments at the distance of half a farsang from Alyabad, to intercept the communication. On this, Raza Kuly Khan Kajar was detached against the rebels : he stormed their entrenchments on the first assault, while the king in person besieged Murtazy Kuly Khan in the Fort of Sam: in the mean time, Jaafer Kuly Khan came from Tinkaben, to join his august brother. After many attacks, assaults, and obstinate engagements, Murtazy Kuly Khan issued forth by the portal of humility, and came to an interview with his brother. The king forgave his offences; and graciously conferred on him Asterabad, with some additional districts ; he also bestowed favours on his court and retinue. When he had thus settled the affairs of Lanjan and Sam, he next turned his attention to the con-'TlrTT^ DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 15 cerns of Scmuman: from thence he proceeded in the direction of Damaghan and Bustaw. The nobles of these regions walked in the paths of obedience; and Kadrim Khan, the Arab, who proffered his alle giance, was made a partaker of the royal munifi cence. Bustam was conferred, by way of thjul, on Jaafer Kuly Khan; and Saman was given in fief (siyurga/) to Aly Kuly Khan. Jan Muhammed Khan, the Kajar, had hastened to tender his sub mission ; and, through his intercession, Murtazy Kuly Khan, accompanied by several Kajar Chief tains, sought the distinction of an interview with his illustrious brother; by whom he was commanded to proceed in the direction of Resht and Gilan, and to bring those regions under the royal authority. On this, Murtazy Kuly Khan advanced, with a numerous army, into Gilan; and Hidayal Khan entered at the portals of war and slaughter: but after forty-five days he demanded a truce, sent tribute, and made his submission. The king then summoned Murtazy Kuly Khan to repair to the royal stirrup, and proceeded from Mazenderan to Asterabad. In the year of the Hejira 1197 (a. d. 1782), as Hidayat Khan was continuing in the practices of rebellion, the king therefore advanced into Gilan ; and Hidayat Khan, not being able to make head against him, fled to Shirwan. And his majesty, after receiving the royal taxes from Gilan, and terminating the affairs of Kazwin, Sultaniyah, and Zanjan, halted at Gorurn Dasht: from thence he proceeded to Sultaniyah, and returned in the autumn to Mazenderan; and in the spring of the next year 1 l i ii i16 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. advanced against the fortress of Teheran, to which he laid siege. Aly Murad Khan Zend, who was then in Hamadan, detached Murad Khan Zend into Mazenderan: on learning this, his majesty appointed Jaafer Kuly Khan to give him battle : he quite defeated the Zendish chief, and totally dispersed his army. In the course of these events, Aly Morad Zend marched from Isfahan to Shiraz; and having, after a siege of nine months, taken the fort, he utterly exterminated Sadik Khan Zend, his children, com panions, and friends : he also deprived of sight Faty Aly Khan, son to Kureem Khan Zend. Having thus terminated the affairs of that country, he re turned to Isfahan; and his position now assumed a most flourishing appearance. He next, with great military preparation^ set out to reduce Mazenderan and Asterabad; and while he himself halted at Teheran, he reinforced his army from every quarter, and detached his son. Shaikh Wais Khan, with a number of his nobles and troops to reduce Asterabad. Mazenderan was entirely laid waste by the oppression of the Zendish and Lorish armies. Shaikh Wais Khan took post at Saru, and ordered Muhammed Zahir Khan Zend, at the head of a considerable force, to attack Asterabad. At this period, Murtazy Kuly Khan, and Mustafa Kuly Khan, broke out into open hostility against his majesty, joined Shaikh Wais Khan, and in concert with Muhammed Zahir Khan proceeded against Asterabad; which place, during one month, they closely blockaded on all sides. His majesty in the mean time appointed severalmmmmmmmmmmmammmatKKaatmm DYNASTY OF THE KAIARS. bands ol resolute men, from Asterabad and the Kajars, to blockade the roads ; so that they cut off' all intercourse and provisions from Shaikh Wais and his numerous army. Famine and dearth ensued in their camp; and thus this mighty army was com pletely dispersed, and Zahir Khan taken prisoner and put to death. Shaikh Wais Khan, with the chiefs and troops stationed at Saru, not being able to make head, fled to Teheian, and joined his father. Murtazy Kuly Khan also fled; and, while proceeding to join Aly Murad Khan, received, in the city of Kooni, an account ot his death. He therefore hastened on to Piesht, by way of Kazwin ; and, without delaying, went to Astra/an, where he attached himself to the party of Ekatarinah, emperor of the Russians, and lived in that country until he bade adieu to this transitory world. After the defeat of Shaikh Wais Khan, and the execution of Muhammed Zahir Khan, Aly Murad Khan, who was labouring under a dropsy, became, through these reverses, more in disposed ; and retired to Isfahan, in the vicinity of which place he left his bodily frame destitute of the ornament of spirit. In the year 1199 (a.d. 1784), his maternal uncle, r Khan Zend, the son of Sadik Khan Zend, who had been detached to Kurdistan and Khomsha h ' s ret,lni from Zanjan to Isfahan, raised the' ^ ndard of sovereignty and usurpation, and seated 'mself on the august throne, in his brother's place. n receiving this intelligence, his majesty, on the » ' l 0 i Itabi-ul-awwal, in the year 1199 (a.d. 1784), llUlll M marched in the direction of Irak, first tookdynasty of the kajars. the city of Koom, and next advanced to and from thence to Isfahan. The nobles and governors of Irak hastened to tender their al e- glance. As Jaafer Khan Zend was unable to make head against him in Isfahan, he therefore fled to Shiraz; and his majesty ordered an expedition against the mountain tribes of Bakhtyari, heraham, and Guzazi: he quite destroyed their entrenched posts, and made great numbers of them the prey of his triumphant sword. In the next year, 1200 ( a.d . 1785), he made Te heran the seat of his empire, and began to lay in it the foundation of royal structures. While advancing from Isfahan to Mala'ir, he received the submission and presents of Ismail Khan Fteli: from thence he marched in the direction of Hamadan; and Khosru Khan, the Wall of Kurdistan, made great expedi tion in sending tribute and tendering his allegiance. In the year 1201 ( a.d . 1786) the army advanced into Gilan, and reduced that country; on this occa sion, one of the Ghoolams shot, with a musket -ball, Hidayat Khan, as he was flying from Enzelle to Bddkohah : he then cut off his head, and presente it to his majesty. In the year 1202 ( a.d . 1787) the king com manded that Aly Khan Khomsha, on account of his treasonable practices, should be deprived of sight- he also ordered an expedition for plundering the Bakhtyari. Jaafer Khan Zend about this time marched trom Shiraz against Yezd ; but having sustained a severe defeat from Mir Muhammed Tabasi, he again re turned to Shiraz. Mir Muhammed Khan becomingdynasty of the kajars. 19 arrogant by this success, advanced against Isfahan: by his majesty's orders, Jaafer Kuly Khan was ap pointed to chastise him; and the contest was con ducted with great animosity, in the territory of Rudashf, adjacent to Isfahan. After a great struggle, Mir Muhammed Khan, having sustained a consi derable defeat, fled to labas: on this, his majesty advanced into Fars, and proceeded as far as Mesjid- e-Suleiman, the burial-place of Solomon's mother fon whom be blessings!) : from thence he turned to Isfahan, and thence to Teheran. In the year 1204 ( a. d . 1789), Jaafer Khan Zend was slam by the hands of his uncle's sons:—such was the decree of Fate respecting him! His son, Lutf AlyKhan, who had been detached to subdue the king dom of Lai, i eturned to Shiraz; and having got his father's murderers into his hands, put them to death. His majesty having now advanced to reduce Fars, Lutf Aly Khan assembled, in the vicinity of Shiraz^ an army of 20,000 men, drawn from the Lor and si tribes, and made preparations for a decisive engagement: his majesty also drew up his line of ., and marshalled his thousands in the vici- nity of Mesjid-i-Vardi. After a short engagement, e aisi troops, being defeated by the bravery and energy of Jaafer Kuly Khan, fled in disorder dejection to the Fortress of Shiraz; 18,000 ln a ntry, and several chieftains of Lutf Aly Khan, were taken prisoners or slain : the fortress, however' as not taken this year, and his majesty returned le capita]. About the end of the year 1205 17 ; ,0), his majesty formed the project of re- uc| ng Azarha'ijan. Sadik Khan Shakaky conceived c 2 r 1 i ■ .120 dynasty of the ka.iars. the design of opposing, at Sarab, the advance ol the august monarch: on the very first attack, his ma jesty destroyed Sarab, and, having kindled the fire of plunder and devastation, consumed in the flames all the houses of that region. On this, Sadik Khan Shakaky fled, and went to Karubagh. At this time, Mustafa Kuly Khan, the governor of Karajah Dagh, and Husain Kuly Khan Dambali, the governor of Kho'ie, arrived in Tabreez, to wait upon his majesty; and, having brought with them hostages from every house and family, were reinstated in their respective offices: in addition to which, Husain Kuly Khan Dambali received the government of Tabreez. Mu- hammed Kuly Khan, the Afshar, the governor ol Urumia, having rebelled, fled to the district ofAslmu: Muhammed Khan uz-uddeen-Lu was immediately ordered to advance against Urumict with 3000 men: he quickly sent to the royal camp all his effects and property; and having thus tranquillized that district, rejoined the imperial encampment. Dur ing these events accounts arrived of the embar rassments experienced by Lutl Aly Khan : on which his majesty moved from Azarba'ijan to Irak; of which events the following is a summaryLutt Aly Khan having come out of Shiraz, advanced witb 20,000 cavalry to the vicinity of Khomsha; and his present majesty, who by the imperial orders commanded in this affair, was posted in the 1 lain oi Kandaman, while Lutf Aly Khan was making pre parations for battle at Smiuram. During the night, Abd -ur-rahmin Khan of Shiraz, pursuant to the directions of his brother, Hajy Ibrahim Khan, adopt ing revolt instead of loyalty, raised a tumult m'V [Tnt'niii'ilTrff iT n i tWlMl i [fi'iff TTtii^lfnrhBBI'gyiWlilliri li i DYNASTY OF THE KAJAHS; 21 the camp of Lutf Aly Khan, who immediately fled with about 200 persons, and retreated to Shiraz; but Hajy Ibrahim Khan shut the gates, and would not suffer him to enter the fort: on this, Lutf Aly Khan, a prey to anxiety and grief, wandered about in the vicinity of Shiraz. Hajy Ibrahim Khan re presented the state of affairs to the Imperial Durbar; and requested a General to be sent to Shiraz, to seize the wealth deposited there belonging to Lutf Aly Khan. His majesty therefore ordered to Shiraz, Mustafa Khan Davalu Kajar, and Mirza Raza Kuly Naway, the Moonshee, along with 3000 men. Immediately on arriving, Mirza Raza Kuly confis cated a great quantity of diamonds set and unset, along with innumerable magazines and treasures, all of which he despatched to Isfahan. Lutf Aly Khan then turned towards Khest, and, on receiv ing great reinforcements from Zal Khan of Khest, directed his march to Gurjum, in order that, by some successful stratagem, he might withdraw his property and children from Shiraz, and then retire to some secure place. Hajy Ibrahim Khan informed Mus tafa Khan of these plans; and he, at the head of 700 cavalry, made a sudden attack on Lutf Aly Khan : hut this latter maintained his ground so bravely during the encounter, that he nearly took Mustafa Muhammed Khan prisoner, who only escaped from the field of battle, with difficulty, by the display of great valour. On the representation of this by ajy Ihialum Khan, Jan INIuhammed Khan was ordered to Shiraz with a considerable force from the imperial presence. Lutf Aly Khan, however, de livered battle to Jan Muhammed Khan near Mejidi-22 -DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. Vardi, obtained the victory, and several nobles were made prisoners. In the year 1206 ( a. d . 1792), the king marched from Teheran for the purpose of subduing Irak. While halting at Abraj, Lutf Aly Khan, with a nu merous army, made a night attack on the imperial camp; but effected nothing, and retreated in great confusion. Hajy Ibrahim Shirazy, with the officers ! and nobles of Fars, formed a procession, to meet the king, and introduce him into the Fort of Shiraz. His majesty removed from the fort the children of Ku- reem Khan, of Aly Murad Khan, and Lutf Aly Khan, also those of other Zend nobles, and sent them all to Asterabad or Mazenderan. In the year 1207 ( a.d . 1792), Kennan, Bdm, and Nermasheer were reduced: his majesty also ordered the Fort of Shiraz, built by Kureem Khan Zend, to be demolished. His majesty next com manded correction and chastisement to be inflicted on the Yamoots of Siyan Khan, and on several Tur komans of Asterabad : great numbers of them were put to death or reduced to slavery and captivity, and on the highways were built minarets constructed with their heads. When he had thus chastised the Turkomans, he formed, in the year 1208 ( a.d . 1793), the project of reducing Khorasan; as accounts had been received that the people of Kerman had broken out into insurrection, and had conquered or slaugh tered the inhabitants of those delightful regions. The summary account of these events is as follows: —Lutf Aly Khan, after enduring severe distress, fled from Tabas to Ha'in, and lived there in disgraceful obscurity. The people of Kerman, their governor,■■ dynasty of the kajars. 23 Murtazy Kuly Khan, and the priest Mulla Abdallah, conveyed Lutf A\y Khan into Kerman, with a nume rous force, composed of his uncles, his uncles' sons, and many Zends of unfortunate destiny, and there gave themselves up to rebellion and plundering; they were also joined by a great number of Afghans from Bam and Sistan. On the receipt of this intel ligence, his majesty set out from Teheran towards Kerman, with an immense army, in order to expel these wretches. When he arrived in the vicinity of Kerman, he erected other fortifications alongside of the fort, and constructed numerous bastions facing those of the city. Night and day both sides were engaged in military stratagems : they formed mines inside and outside the walls. The siege had now continued five months, and famine began to appear among the besieged; and although 9000 persons had quitted the town, yet this was of no benefit to the remainder of the population. His majesty issued forth this order, powerful as the decree of Destiny: ' Let the Ameers and soldiers assault the fort, and take it by storm ; and let the inhabitants ' perish by the keen-edged scimetar.' On Friday the 29th ot Rabi-ul-awwal, in the year of the Hejira 1209 ( a. d . 1794), they made the attack, scaled the bastions, and took the city by storm: the victors gave full loose to plunder, devastation, and making of prisoners. It was at first supposed that Lutf Aly Khan was among the slain ; but he had escaped from the fort, and taken the route to Bam, with a few of his attendants and retinue. In that place, the Sis- tanians, having hamstrung his horse, threw him on the ground, and then bound and conveyed him into24 dynasty of the kajars. the royal presence: his eyes were first put out; after which he was sent to Teheran, where they put him to death. There was such exceeding slaughter made of the people of Kerman, that the blood flowed in streams. Among the jewels which had belonged to his majesty's family, two that were named Taj-i- mah and Darya-i-nur, which had been in the pos session of Lutf Aly Khan, were once more transferred to his majesty. In the year 1209 ( a.d . 1794), his majesty marched into Azarba'ijan: he determined to reduce Karahagh, and to take Ibrahim Khahil Khan prisoner : how ever, this year his attempt to take the Fort of Panahabad, called also the Castle of Shushi, did not succeed. Departing from thence, he raised his warlike banners for the purpose of subduing Gurjistan. He immediately defeated Erakly Khan, Waly of that country, and entered the Fort of Tejlis: there fell into the hands of the soldiers, immense riches, maidens beautiful as the moon, jessamin-bosomed youths, and rosy-cheeked dam sels : nearly 15,000 persons were made prisoners on this occasion. Erakly Khan fled, by way of ha/f/it and Kartil; and his majesty remained nine days at Teflis. The army next advanced to Ganja, and completely reduced the districts of Shakki and Shirwan. Mustafa Khan, of Shirwan, fled to Mount Filu; and his majesty returned to Teheran, the capital. In the year 1210 ( a. d . 1795), being seated on the throne, his majesty placed the crown on his head; and, displaying his victorious banners, set out with an immense force l or the purpose of subduing Khorasan.DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 25 On learning this, Nadir Mirza, grandson to Nadir Shah Afshar, and son to Shah Rokh Mirza, fled to Kandahar, and lived under the protection of Timur Shah the Afghan; where, far removed from those delightful regions, and deprived of royal authority, lie became the prey of agony and unbounded afflic tion. When his majesty arrived near the Fort of Mushed, hallowed by the tomb of Imaum lleza, he easily conquered that fortress. Shah Rokh Mirza was then made prisoner ; from whom he demanded the treasures of Nadir Shah, which were in his pos session. As soon as Shah Rokh had delivered up the treasures and jewels, he fell sick (i.e. he was poisoned) and at the same time turned his face to the other world. In the year 1211 ( a. d . 1796), his majesty marched an army into Azarba'ijan ; and, in order to reduce Panahabad, he commanded the Nawab, the suc cessor to temporal and spiritual power, the Prince Abbas Mirza, with the Nawab Muhammed Kuly Mirza, then at court, also Husain Kuly Khan, Suli- nian Khan, Hajy Ibrahim Khan of Shiraz, and a number of the chiefs, to halt with the baggage and stores in Adinah Bazar, near the fort; while he himself, attended by soldiers invulnerable as cro codiles, boiling with ardour like the ocean, strong as mountains, accompanied by Sadik Khan Shakaky, crossed the River Aras like a whirlwind. On the news of his march, Ibrahim Khalil Khan became confounded and alarmed, abandoned the strong Fort Panahabad, and fled in the direction of Daghe- stan. His majesty entered the fort, and made himself master of abundant stores and countless26 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. treasures, the property of Armenians and Maho metans. Whereas, in metaphysical disquisition, according to the rule of understanding, it is a settled point, that perfection is accompanied by decay—that good fortune, though it may continue long, must change—that every Spring is succeeded by December, and every heart-expanding pleasure by some soul-corroding care ; thus, on Friday night, the 21st of Zy-hajjah-ul-Haram, near the rising ot the true dawn, two or three Ghoolams belonging to the court like that of the Seventh Heaven—who, like trees with cankered roots, though watered by the stream of royal bounty, produce nothing but evil fruit—now assisted the Powers of the magic triangle to destroy the structure of universal dominion: they hurried to his pillow, for the purpose ol as sassinating the Sultan, equitable as Jamshid, and trembling, through terror of conscience, like willow- leaves : in their hands they bore a tapering poniard, and, through ingratitude thirsting after the blood of their benefactor, with the dagger they martyred the monarch of exalted genius, and defiled the royal night- robes with the ruby-coloured blood of the Prince of the Seven Thrones, who (when alive) displayed the roseate features of sway, extensive as the world. Thus the sun which shone in the firmament of royalty and splendor, in the meridian of happiness and prosperity, through the violence of these malignant wretches, set for ever in the western hori zon of mortality and decay. As soon as this auda cious enterprise and important event had been per petrated by the impure and remorseless wretches, they seized the crown and regal diadem—everyr DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 27 pearl of which was of incomparable beauty, and the value of every single stone was equal to the amount of the taxes and tributes of the Seven Climates; also the other royal effects and furniture, such as, diamond-armlets, foe-destroying swords set with precious-stones, and caskets of jewels ; also the diamonds called the Koh-i-nur, the Darya-i-nur, and the Taj-i-mah ; and gloriously-illuminated Ma nuscripts, (every) a single particle of which would be sufficient to embellish the bosom and shoulders of all the monarchs of the world, and each frag ment capable of forming the capital stock of the most intelligent. The assassins fled secretly, and conveyed these effects to Sadik Khan Shakaky, to whom they imparted this awful and painful in telligence. He at first did not believe the fact; but when they placed before him the royal orna ments, he became convinced of the certainty, and took all the effects into his own custody. It was now near sun-rise. When this atrocious deed be came known to the Ameers and the soldiers, they were plunged into the sea of perplexity; and found no possibility of delaying any longer, but each tribe hastened to its respective plains and mountains. Muhammed Husain Khan, the Kisheek-jey Bashy, and Mirza Raza Kuly, the Moonshee-al-Mumalik, on learning this event, came to the bedchamber of the equitable monarch, and beheld his august corpse ; which added splendor to the throne now floating like a ship in a sea of blood. Seeing it impossible to carry away the illustrious corpse, they stripped off the remaining rubies and precious-stones which had been left through the alarm of the plunderers;28 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. being then joined by several chiefs of the army, they mounted on horseback, and proceeded to the capital, by way of Nakhshiwan and Maragah. When this event became generally known, the royal camp was broken up. Husain Kuly Khan, Suleiman Khan, and several Ameers and nobles who had ac companied the princes, scattered the stores and baggage, and mixed the treasures of the world with the dust: they afterwards, in exceeding perplexity, directed their steps towards the capital. Hajy Ibrahim Khan of Shiraz, along with a numerous body of chiefs, officers, and musketeers ol Mazen- deran, separating from the young princes, proceeded to Teheran by way of Ardabil and Kanjan, in the vicinity of which he joined Muhammed Husain Khan and Mirza Raza Kuly. At last, the piinces, along with Husain Kuly Khan, Suleiman Khan, and the troops that accompanied them, arrived at Teheran, by way of Taiilish, Shaft, and Resht: the others, by various routes, traversing mountains and deserts, and encountering innumerable priva tions and difficulties, arrived at the same place, and reposed themselves in the vicinity of the fort. The vizir, equal to Asuf, Mirza Muhammed Shaft, was at that time deposed from office ; and Hajy Ibrahim Khan Shirazy occupied his place. The garrison ot the fort, who were mostly natives of Mazenderan, and paid implicit obedience to orders, prohibitions, regulations, and admonitions, agreeably to the direc tions of the deceased monarch (who reposes in Paradise), co-operated with Muhammed Khan Kajar, and effectually prevented the other Ameers and soldiers altogether from entering the citadel: theyDYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 29 were therefore obliged to pitch their tents outside the walls; and the eye of expectation of those inside and outside was fixed on the road by which his imperial majesty was to arrive. Aly Kuly Khan, who was in Erivan 1 , on hearing the melancholy fate of his brother, being accom panied by all his troops, proceeded to Irak by way of Khoie, Maragah, and Tabreez; and on arriving at the village of A/y Shahuz, a village in the district of Shahrij/ar, situated about five parasangs from Teheran, foolishly imagining that his royal falcon was capable of soaring on high, under the idea of giving him wing, through excessive vanity, took him to the hunting-ground of Fortune, and assumed his post in that place. After an interval of some days, new life was bestowed on the drooping hearts of the Ameers and soldiers, by the intelligence that the standard, ornamented with victory, belonging to the sovereign, the benefactor of the upright, was ad vancing from Shiraz, the seat of learning. CHAP. IV. AN ACCOUNT OF THE INSURRECTION RAISED BY SADIK KUAN SHAKAKY. When the murderers of the monarch (now in Pa radise) had delivered the royal insignia to Sadik Khan, he, at the moment of leaving the Fort of Panahabad, turned his face towards the great en campment, and gave security, under the shade of his protection, to those traitorous and infatuated assas sins : he next crossed the River Aras, with a number the Shakaky Kurds that were attached to him : and some scattered detachments from the royal camp.so DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. mostly natives of Azarba'ijan, through apprehension of danger, assembled round him. Still following the rear of the royal army, he came as far as the Ruins of Sarab : he there, through desire of the sovereign power, which always lived in his heart, and appa rently under pretence of delivering his wife and son from the Fort of Kazwin, but internally through the crude ambition of the exalted throne and impe rial signet, bound on his forehead the diadem of rebellion against the sovereign of the face of the earth. He therefore collected a numerous body of Shakaky Kurds scattered about in the territory of Salduz, Maragah, and Tabreez, as far as the confines of Ardabil and Mughan. He next de tached one of his brothers to assume the govern ment of Tabreez, and another to take possession of Karajah Dagh, while he himself raised his banner in Irak. When he came to Kazwin, the inhabitants and chiefs of that city, for their own protection having closed the gates of the citadel against him, extended their arms to hurl the death-conveying balls from the fire-scattering barrels of muskets; and, in order to display their well-merited fame, per formed deeds of determined bravery on their bas tions and ramparts. Sadik Khan, therefore, with a numerous assemblage of the Shakaky Kurds, pitched his tent outside Kazwin. At this time, orders for provisions, in the name of his ill-fated chiefs, were issued to the villages of Kazwin : the intoxicated were roused from their sleep, the abodes of the poor and the dwellings of the inhabitants were laid waste, and in a short time they swept the entire vicinity of Kazwin with the besom of Desolation : theyDYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 31 made incursions on every side, and kindled in every quarter the flames of their selfish cruelty and dis regard for others : they wholly consumed with fire whatever provisions they found in the huts of the helpless. In short, during the blockade they made two or three assaults on the fort, and a great many were killed and taken on both sides. Sadik Khan continued to persevere in his design of taking the citadel; and the chiefs of Kazwin well knew that the attainment of this object depended on his defeating the Kajar nobles and the Sultan distinguished as Feridun: they therefore had recourse to procrastina tion and delay, and eagerly looked for the arrival of the retinue of the sovereign, assisted by Providence. Through the tyranny practised by his brother Jaafer Khan in Azarba'ijan, the hearts of the people of Karajah Dagh became, like tulips, covered with san guine hues and wounds : in like manner, the festive bowls of the inhabitants of Tabreez overflowed with the dregs of oppression from the other brother, Mu- hammed Aly Sultan : the lower classes, plunderers, profligates, dissolute characters, and bankrupts, sur rounded his house, like troops of bats around some dark vault, and shared amongst themselves the riches and booty obtained by the army of the mon arch now reposing in Paradise. The chiefs, the prudent, and the upright, withdrawing their feet under the mantle of retirement, looked forward to the arrival of happiness and the return of tran quillity. During the blockade of Kazwin, Sadik Khan detached both his brothers from Tabreez and Karajah Dagh to take the Fortress of Khoie, which had been evacuated by the chiefs of the royal army : I : :32 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. whereupon they, having collected a force composed of peasants, auxiliaries both Turk and Tajuk, ar tisans and manufacturers from Tabreez and Kara- jah Dagh, directed their march to Khoie. CHAP. V. THE ACCOUNT OF THE ARRIVAL OF THE INTELLIGENCE OF THE BLESSED MONARCH'S MARTYRDOM TO THE EXALTED HEARING OP THE TRIUMPHANT SOVEREIGN; AND THE MARCH OF THE IMPE RIAL RETINUE FROM FARS TO IRAK. When the melancholy fate of his incomparable uncle was communicated to the devoted attendants of the court of exalted splendor at Shiraz the seat of learning, and made known to the blessed mind of the sovereign favoured by Heaven, he became grieved and troubled : but, as this conjuncture presented the opportunity of ascending the pinnacle of the Celestial Throne, not a season for attending to the ceremo nials of mourning, on this account the eagle-banner with conquering talons commenced his flight from regions resembling Paradise, to Teheran, the seat of empire. From the proposed march of the new sove reign to his new throne, the fainting hearts obtained repose. Although Husain Kuly Khan had admitted wicked projects into his heart, yet as, apparently, his hand had become powerless, and his feet unable to move, he of necessity turned to the protection of the mighty sovereign whose heart was the ocean of mercy, and had the honour of kissing his carpet outside of Teheran. ' What can the servant do, who bends not his neck to authority ? ' What can the ball do, if it be not struck by the bat?'dynasty of the kajars. S3 Aly Kuly Khan, on the mere arrival of the for tunate sovereign, and on witnessing the insignia of imperial power and dominion, although he had pre viously fancied himself master of the world, now ga\e up his purpose in despair, and humbled him self to the dust: at the command of the Sun (i .e. the King), whose satellites are Gemini, two Ghoo- lams, with the avenging powers of the planet Mars, biought him to the foot of the throne, resembling that of Heaven. But after some time, when the discovery of his internal depravity became apparent, by order of the sovereign indulgent to error, his eyes were deprived of sight; and he seated himself quietly in a corner of his abode at Balfrush. When the kin^ mounts his throne, The nobles fall into their proper places.' In consequence of the deeds of the vile Shakaky, the intense flame of royal indignation blazed to the sky: the sovereign therefore first ordered Husain Khan Kajar, the Kullar Agasy, with an army re sistless as the ocean-waves, to restore tranquillity to the people of Kazwin and the adjacent territory. In the course of these events, Muhammed Waly Khajar Khan, who on the part of the late monarch had been appointed to guard the Fort of the Holy City of Meshed with five or six thousand men, on hearing the awful event, quitted that place, and a the honour of kissing the stirrup of his sacred majesty. The triumphant sovereign regarded the J^al of these troops, distinguished by victory, as e essential support of his never-decaying pro- s I* nt y, and looked upon it as a fortunate omen. L ' now assembled the chiefs of his army, and the34 dynasty of the kajars. confidential Ministers of the court dignified as the Seventh Heaven, and opened the doors ot his treasures: through showering down dirhems and dinars, he relieved the expanse of the earth from the contracted sphere of indigence. It has been anciently said, ' With gold we can equip an army : ' With an army we can terminate many quarrels. ' The kin'- equipped a triumphant force, « At sight of which the eyes of the Sun and Moon became astonished.' Several nobles, on observing that the triumphant sovereign in person designed to repel the enemies of the State, considered the project as unsuitable to his dignity; and, having kissed the earth, thus made their representations at the foot ot the throne ; exalted as the Seventh Heaven' Why should ' the vile crows, wandering in the deserts of Error, ' attract the notice of the imperial falcon ?—should ' their base blood sully his talons ? His prey is ' the noble Enka. Or are the hares and foxes, ' scattered over the plains of Delusion, the proper ' prey of the lordly, bull-subduing, lion. It is not ' meet that the king's sovereign majesty should deign ' to contend in battle against a feeble enemy. ' The falcon is disgraced, the day he kills a spar- ' row: the lion is covered with shame, the day he ' kills a jackal. Let his majesty, powerful as Des- ' tiny, command the troops of his devoted servants ' to drive away these rebellious and refractory ' wretches, and in an instant they will scatter to ' the winds their fabrics founded in iniquity, l^ e ' as the whirlwinds scattered the erections of thei ■BHMBMHL DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 35 (( Children of Ad. We are an hundred times more ' powerful than the Deluge, which drowned the whole world. Who can resist one troop of us ?'■ The high-minded sovereign paid no attention to this representation of his nobles, and decided to march in person, and give battle to his infatuated foes. ' He commanded the royal tent to be pitched, ' And the pavilion to be fixed on the margin of the plaint The pillars and ropes of the royal court, fit to ornament the Nine Heavens, came forth; the many- coloured flags, and tents of various hues, were erected, which from afar appeared as hundreds of revolving spheres; and the dragon-like standards were directed towards Kazwin, for the purpose of chastising the rebels. From the vicinity of the city, the king marched forward ; having arranged with his mighty warriors, military chiefs, victorious sol ders, and commanders powerful as the planet Mars, the right, left, centre, and wings, as well as troops ior reserve and for ambush. ' The mighty sphere advanced from its place : Mountains and forests seemed in motion.' Sadik Khan also, impelled onwards by rebellion and depravity, in the convulsions of death came forth to oppose the sovereign of the universe. The intrepid warriors on both sides planted their un daunted footsteps in the lists of bravery ; the flame 0 attic and assault was vigorously maintained ; rom the loud clangor of the trumpet, the shrill 'otes of the fife, accompanied by the loud-voiced anun, the dome of the ebony sphere became so ag 1 ated, that there was reason to fear the golden 1SC 01 the world-cherishing sun might fall, from the D 220 dynasty of the kajars. roof of the blue canopy of the sky, to the earth. In the midst of the dark dust, the polished swords every instant were seen to flash: the serpent-faced Lassos, in the deserts of Revenge, opened wide their jaws, like the deep-swallowing crocodiles, to bear away the bodies of noble and heroic men; while the fiery-mouthed dragons, that is, muskets and swivels, with pestilential breath, and flame-exciting blasts like the ironfounder's furnace, burned up the held of battle. In the commencement, the Kurdish army bravely maintained its ground, and exhibited all the qualities of devotedness. Sadik Khan tia also frequently before the engagement began, in order to encourage his troops and to shew them contempt for cowardice and flight, addressed t e ill-fated Shakakis with promised threats, making use of this text: O my people! let not your opposing u of me draw on you a vengeance like unto that ' which fell on the people of Noah &amp;c.!' {Sales Koran, cap. xi.) They,however,found the steel-edged swords wielded by the foe-chasing heroes stronger than the rampart of Alexander, and, Yojuj-hke, He in terror before the rapacious lions. Sadik Khan, the claimant for the crown and throne, striking his forehead with the hand of regret, and pouring the tears of despair down his face, fled, with his wicke associates, to Sarab, and covered his former name and reputation with the dust of abject disgiace The imperial troops rushed impetuously on the fugi tives, and stained with their blood the brambles and thickets of the desert of Slaughter. Sadik Khan retired to Sarab, in the hope that his brothels ia obtained the Fort of Khoie by prudence and skill,DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 37 In and had strengthened the fortifications of Tabreez, so that in this time of his need these resources would be left hinr, and he might have a place of se curity. But, before the battle of Kazwin, the younger brothers of Husain Khan Dambaly had dis covered the designs entertained by Sadik Khan's brothers. At that moment, Husain Khan was in Kazwin, and Jaafer Kuly Khan was in waiting on the victorious stirrup. The different tribes of Dambali, who at the time the royal encampment was broken up (/. e. when Aga Muhammed Khan was murdered) were separated from each other like a ship without a pilot, as soon as they were re-united, fought in Mazenderan against the brothers of Sadik Khan, and, favoured by the fortune of the victorious sove reign, and assisted by Providence, without so much as being obliged to set in array a line of battle, gave them a decisive defeat; so that the brothers of Sadik Khan, not being able to maintain themselves there, fled with precipitation towards the Fortress ol Tabreez, and in two hours, having with incredible speed traversed fourteen parasangs (i. e. something more than fifty miles), arrived there. Many cele brated horses, fleeter than the fast-swimming ducks*, and swifter than the rapidly-moving fish in the river, were destroyed. It is a wonderful coincidence, that Sadik Khan's brothers were defeated on the same day on which he himself fled with precipitation ftom the royal troops.

According to the royal com mand, their limbs and members were severed by the sword and dagger; and their souls, bound in fiery chains, were dragged to the lowest abyss of Hell, where they quaffed, from the hands of the tor turing Angels, the punishment of swallowing molten metal and putrefying gore. Then, in the midst of the army, a herald proclaimed :— ' 4 Such is the reward of him who slays his lord!— ' ' Even the most Merciful Creator never pardons ' ' The servant who smites his master.'

When the Para- disc-like region ot Zanjan, through the presence of the sovereign dignified as Jamshid, became like a jet-d'eau of the Fountain of Life, and resembled a plantation of roses and odoriferous plants, Sadik Khan addressed to the court, the asylum of justice, the most humble representations, requesting pardon and forgiveness for his errors, and at the same time delivering up the effects and insignia of the monar chy to Ibrahim Khan. On his arrival at the gra cious presence, he was appointed, by the Durbar, the centie ot the world, of the error-forgiving, crime- pardoning sovereign, to the government of Karma- zood and Sarab. During the time that the royal forces, distinguished by victory, continued in Zanjan, there arrived addresses, expressive of devotedness, from the nobles and governors of Azarba'ijan: on which occasion the royal munificence profusely be stowed gifts on the nobles, proportioned to their rank. Muhammed Khan of Erivan, who was in attendance at court, was made happy by the govern ment of Kachur the Fortunate; and Ismail Khan j a 1 , ln conjunction with him, was appointed to the office of Kutwal in the Fort of Erivan. Jaafer Khan Dumbaly, who above all others had exhibited proofs of his devotedness in the vestibule of the illustrious presence, was raised to the govern ments of Tabreez (the seat of authority) and Kho'y : rom which place Husain Kuly Khan uz-uddeen Lu *ajar was despatched with Letters-patent, power- uI as the decrees of Fate, to Ibrahim Khan,40 dynasty of the kajars. governor of Carabaug, to convey the bier of the late monarch to Teheran, on its way to Negef Aly. This done, the victorious banners moved from Zanjan, to Teheran the capital; and the Nizam ud-daulah Su leiman Khan Kajar proceeded in the direction of Resht (the seat of agriculture), to arrange the affairs of Gilan. On the 24th of Rabi-ul-awwal, in the year 1212 (a. d. 1797), the royal throne, through the auspi cious presence of the world-subduing sovereign, ex cited the envy of the nine azure vaults of heaven; and when the monarch had resided some days in the centre of Fortune, the bier of the late monarch (now an inhabitant of Paradise), accompanied by re citers and chaunters of the Koran from Azarba'ijan (harmonious as King David), and by several gran dees and nobles, was conveyed to the capital. The triumphant sovereign with all his nobles formed a procession to meet the blessed royal bier: from the furnaces of the eyes of the victorious sovereign, nobles, and soldiers, such torrents of tears began to rush forth, that the world witnessed another Deluge; while the royal coffin, like Noah's ark, deprived of its anchor and sails, moved along, borne on the mourners' shoulders*. Some days after, when the rules of mourning and lamentation had been com pleted, the coffin being placed on a gilt carriage, a command was given to Muhammed Aly Khan Kajar, Mirza Musa the Munajjem Bashy, Mula Mustafa of Kamsha, and Ibrahim Khan uz-uddeen Lu, to set out, with chaunters and reciters, and all fit and * The bearers reeled for gTief, not being able to keep a stead) pace.dynasty of the kajars. 41 suitable splendor, and witli an escort of infantry and cavalry, and presents of the purest gold, to Meshed the Holy, where is the Tomb of Aly—May thou sands of the choicest blessings of Heaven rest on its inhabitants!

The extent of the fortunate hall of audience witnessed the salutations and embraces of the princes of the various king doms. In front ot the portico, sublime as the Seventh Heaven, were displayed strings of precious- stones, taken from the custody of the imperial treasurer: one might suppose that the rubies of brilliant water were fixed stars and planets, torn from the stratum of the firmament: the numerous heaps of dirhems and dinars, brought out from the exchequer of the world-possessing sovereign, one might imagine to be blossoms and leaves of flowers, which had been scattered on every side by the agita tion of the vernal winds: the Ghoolams, with sun like cheeks, in presenting gold and jewels, seemed to empty the ocean and the mine, and filled the pockets and sleeves of those admitted to the royal audience: whilst those who kissed the ground of the royal court were, by the auspicious favour and smiles of the king, the asylum of the world, raised m glory to the zenith of the heavens.

At this period. Prince Mahmud, son of Timur Shah the Afghan, having obtained the honour of an inter view with the munificent and victorious sovereign, all the rules of conciliation and sympathy suita ble to such a guest were put in execution by his imperial host. The explanation of this riddle, and the solution of this enigma, is as follows:—Timur Shah the Afghan, in order to strengthen the foun dation of his empire, appointed Prince Humayun, his eldest son, the successor to the crown ; assigning at the same time, as the seat of his dominion and residence, the ancient and celebrated city of Kan dahar. On Prince Mahmud he conferred the government of Herat and the adjacent territory; while he himself passed his summer and winter residence in Kabul, his capital, and in Peshawar: his own brothers he detained in the lofty Fortress of Kabul, which in strength and position is truly miraculous ; and, being thus secured against their plots and machinations, passed his time tranquilly in the residence of that fort. When he had di vested himself of the royal robes, and entered on the road to the other world. Prince Zemaun, who was younger than the Princes Humayun and Mahmud, and had always remained with his father, assumed the crown, and raised the standard of superiority. His elder brothers did not bow the head to his authority; and, in the mean time, armies were raised and blood was shed: at last, PrinceDYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 45 Humayun, having sustained a severe defeat, fell into his hands, and, the vitreous humour of the eye being- deprived of the ornament of light by the application of diamond-like steel, placed himself in retirement, a prey to regret. Prince Mahmud^ taking along with him his younger brother Firooz, his own son Prince Kamzan, with several noble Afghans, turned for protection to the threshold of the sublime sovereign, the benefactor of the righteous. On their arrival at Yezd, the seat of piety, the nature of their condition was reported at the foot of the throne exalted as the heavens, by the devoted Ministers of the court of splendor; on which, the friend-assisting, foe-subduing sovereign appointed Ismail Aga from Makri to be their Mehmandar, and shew them every mark of attention: royal firmauns to this purport were also issued forth to the governors of the provinces :—' In every place let their arrival be 'received with honour, and let the rights of hospi- ' tality be duly observed.' When they arrived at the imperial banquet, arranged like that of Paradise, and obtained an interview with the resplendent po tentate, he, with the polish of mercy and munificence , removed the corroding rust from the mirror of their souls. An order was therefore given to Cheragh % Khan Nuw'ai to maintain an uninterrupted intercourse and unceasing intimacy with them, by illuminating the banquet of Delight, and kindling the lamp of hospitality in the porticoes of Joy.40 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. CHAP. X. AN ACCOUNT OF THE INSURRECTION RAISED IN ISFAHAN BY MUHAMMED KHAN, SON TO ZAKKY KHAN ZEND. When the fortunate career of the Zend dynasty had been arrested by the victorious hands ot the deceased triumphant monarch, and the spring ot their prospe rity turned into winter*, among the fugitives ol that race, Muhammed Khan, son to Zakky Khan, con tinued traversing the desert of utter destitution, and wandering through the stages of the valley ot per plexity ; every day in some new station, and at night in some new halting-place. Through tear for his life, the area of the world became to him more con fined than a prison: he sometimes retired to Bus- sorah, and sometimes to Bagdad ; and thus, hatching crude projects in his brainless head, he passed his days and nights in constant agitation. After the predestined fate of the late monarch, at the time of Sadik Khan Shakaky's treason, Muham med Khan proceeded from Bussorah with a number of his friends; and, expecting that his desperate disease (i.e. his hopeless enterprise) might assume a favourable appearance, turned his face to Bihbehan. On finding this place destitute of auxiliaries and partisans, he proceeded to the district of Kazeroon. The Mumsany, one of the Farsi tribes, assembled to attack him, and, being joined by a body of the royal army appointed to guard that country, broke the soaring pinions of the vile wretch. He next fled to Khabees, where he entertained hopes oi 0 * ' Now is the winter of our discontent Made glorious summer by this sun of ^ ork.DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 47 finding support from the Afghans settled in that country; but, despairing of their co-operation, and oppressed with despondency and regret, he hastened towards Isfahan. It so happened, at that moment, that the magistrates and nobles had set out to Teheran, for the purpose of saluting the threshold of his triumphant majesty ; and one of the brothers of Hajy Muhammed Husain Khan, who was then in Isfahan, without inquiring into the state of the hostile assemblage, fearlessly attacked them, and was made prisoner. On this fortunate occurrence, Muhammed Khan Zend, imagining that success had declared for his side, moved his quarters to the Garden ol Saadat-abad ; and numbers of the Lors, who were an influential class in Isfahan, attached themselves to his party : so that the inhabitants of Isfahan, like sheep without a shepherd, fell under his power; and in the course of two or three days, the invaders got into their hands their goods and effects, consisting of merchandise, horses, and cash. In the mean time, Muhammed Khan Zend en trusted the government of the city to Mirza Abd- ul-Wahab; and gave himself up to seizing the wealth of the merchants, and the oppression of the nobles of the illustrious city. When this intelligence was conveyed to the equitable sovereign, this prince, high in dignity, the shadow of the Almighty, ap pointed Husain Kuly Khan Kajar Davaly, Mihr Aly khan Dashlu'a, Allah Verdy Khan uz-uddeen Lu, and Husain Khan, Kullar Akazy, with a numerous ody of troops, to repel the invaders. The opposing parties encountered each other in the vicinity of • no resource but flight was left to the insur-18 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. gents : and Husain Khan, having pursued them some way, turned his face towards Saadat-abad, the head quarters of the race devoted to misfortune : on this, Muhammed Khan and his associates fled with pre cipitation. In the course of these events, Yusuf Khan Bakhtyari, having seized Najuf Khan Zend, who was really the soul of the insurrection, and his supporters, despatched them to the court, the asylum of the world. The world-subduing king made his associates swallow the beverage of destruction from the fount of the well-tempered falchion ; and bound him, who was always hatching in his crude brain the vapour of pride and arrogance through lust of domi nion, to the muzzle of the dragon-mouthed mortar: he had scarcely opened his eyes from the effects pro duced by the intoxication of his evil deeds, before he beheld himself in the jaws of the dragon of woe, and by the application of the fire-exciting match his members became scattered in the air, like smoke. Muhammed Khan, and his nephew, Rustam Khan, on learning the fate of Nujuf Khan, withdrew to Si- lakhur, which is the residence of numbers of Ba- chilan and Piranahwand, and sought refuge among those tribes; and these people, devoted to eternal misery, listened to the evil-disposed band. At that time, Nuzur Aly Khan Bajilan, having assaulted the fort where Muhammed Khan dwelt, took him pri soner, and proposed sending him to the court, the asylum of the world. However, a Bajilan, by name Mahdi, the false prophet among these deluded and rebellious troops, being joined by several of them, rescued Muhammed Khan from their clutches, and rose up with all his friends in his defence. H ieDYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 19 hostility ot these two individuals caused greater support to be given to Muhammed Khan, so that the flame of tumult and insurrection blazed afresh to the portals of heaven. By orders emanating from the splendid and glorious Durbar, Muhammed Khan Kajar, governor of Kazaz and Mala'ir, Hasan Khan, chief oi l ilee, andTuky Khan, governor of Barujcrd, were appointed to drive away the insurgents. They joined in battle in the vicinity of Silakhur; dur ing the engagement, Tuky Khan received a severe wound, in consequence of which he departed to the other world. The affair, of course, did not succeed ; tind the hostile parties afterwards took the direction which their defence and resources induced them to consider best. By degrees, crowds of base people collected round them, and the flame of insurrection ascended on high, as shall hereafter be written with the pen of Description; but it was finally sup pressed, through the bravery of Muhammed Khan Kajar, and the well-tempered swords of his soldiers, foes to the ungrateful.

At this period, Jaafer Kuly Khan Damhaly, who had been brought up at the court embellished with perpetuity, and had been distinguished by the government ot Khoie and Tabreez, being, by his imperial majesty, dis missed from attendance, proceeded to Tabreez by way of Maragah. Sadik Khan, from internal de pravity, and the previous enmity he entertained against Jaafer Kuly Khan, began to plan hostilities; and the latter, in return, having collected a nu merous force, attacked the Shakaky tribe, and laid Sarab waste. Sadik Khan not being able to with stand him, abandoned his usual residence, and turned in the direction of Mughan, from whence he proceeded to Shirwan: he continued some time wandering about that country in great distress, but always occupied in his plans to depri\e Jaafer K.u} Khan of the royal protection, by making him com mit some act of treason. Jaafer Kuly Khan, who had received from the hand of royal munificence greater favours than were suited to his talents and contracted genius, withdrew from his dependence on the king ; which was so light, that in reality 11 was absolute independence. Sadik Khan seeing where he pointed his steps, opened the path of u tercourse with him; and coming from Shirwan to Sarab, concerted with Jaafer Kuly Khan the e(lifi ce of temptation. Muhammed Kuly Khan Afshai also, through weakness of intellect and want odynasty of the kajars. Ol discernment, suffered himself to be seduced by their foolish flatteries and absurd artifices, to join them. At this time the news of Muhammed Khan Zend's insurrection having reached these men, it encou raged them greatly : they raised the standard of re volt, and the tidings of their hostile purpose reached the ears of friends and foes. They expelled the king s officers ; and then each of them, with troops resembling a flock of crows, or the mirage of the desert, sat down at his ease in the plains of Ta- bieez, Roomeah, and Sarah: looking upon their purpose as accomplished, and banishing all anxiety from their breasts, they openly displayed the ban ners of revolt. Husain Kuly Khan, the nephew of Muhammed Kuly Khan Afshar, beholding the blind ness of his uncle, manifested his grief, and directly prayed to be admitted to an audience of his exalted majesty. When permitted to kiss the sublime threshold, he explained, at the foot of the fortunate throne, the true state of the affair; and the victo- nous sovereign heard him with complacency, and determined to chastise the rebels. The Nuwab Mahmud Mirza the Afghan, who through the op pression of fortune and the violence of his brother Zemaun Mirza (afterwards Zemaun Shah) suffered great anguish, directed the hand of supplication wards the royal pavilion, and turned the eyes of expectation towards his glorious majesty, for the eliverance of his hereditary realms; but the pro- 0U nd policy oi the king had not yet arranged the preliminaries for the completion of such a request. 1 he Afghan prince was most anxious to attend the on his progress ; but painful as it was to his f, 252 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. sacred soul, hospitality forbad him to submit the prince to the fatigues of a journey: and as the air of the capital at this season was more ardent than the lover's heart, one of the courtiers, with great pomp, was appointed to the office ol Mehmandar, and the prince's abode and place of recreation was fixed at Kashan ; so that, until the period when the splendor of the victorious sun should return from his western journey to his eastern glory (/. e. the king's return from Mazenderan to Teheran*), he might pass his days in hunting the partridge in the desert, and thus loosen the bonds of woe from his soul; and at night, in the retirement of that city, by contact with polished society and poetic pearls, he might expel the rust of affliction from the mirror of his mind. The king next appointed Muhammed Waly Khan Kajar, with troops numerous as the stars, to govern the territory of Alishakr, and also to repel the wickedness of Muhammed Khan, son to Zakk) Khan Zend. An order was also given to Husain Kuly Khan Afshar, that, on leaving the Durbar of the all- subduing sovereign, he should collect his partisans among the Afshar tribe, reduce the Fort of Roo- meah, and employ all possible means to secure his uncle's person. The advance of the victorious army was confided to the Nizam ud-daulah Suleiman Khan Kajar, and the triumphant standard was put in motion shortly after his departure. After some days, the camp of the host, numerous as the stars, was pitched in the Plain of Sultaniyah; and a mighty conflagration arose from the fire struck out * Teheran lies eastward of Mazenderan, at least to some part o that province, sufficiently to justify the figure here made use of.DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 53 of the earth by the shoes of the desert-traversing steeds, in pursuit of the rebels to the harvest-place of their tranquillity in Azarba'ijan. Among these three traitors of innate depravity, Sadik Khan, who had often on the touchstone of experience assayed the spurious gold of his heart in the mint of battle, well knew that the gnat cannot withstand the wood pecker, and that the fox's claws make not an impres sion on the lion's forehead: he therefore turned away from supporting his associates, and through necessity solicited the mediation of Ministers; his chief purpose being to prove Jaafer Kuly Khan a traitor, which was afterwards effected. He therefore entreated Suleiman Khan to intercede for the pardon of his offences ; and he, not putting the hand of repulsion on his breast, urged, by the most humble supplications, this boon from his exalted majesty. The gales of Hope straightway proceeded from the imperial court:— ' Our court is not the court of despair: ' For shouldst thou a hundred times otfend, still mercy is not exhausted.' Such glad tidings came to Sadik Khan, who was admitted to salute the dust of the threshold of equity, at the station of Sung-i-Siyah. The bond of union between Jaafer Kuly Khan and Muham- nied Kuly Khan being thus rent asunder, the bark ot their stability was sunk in the whirlpool of stu pefaction. With wounded hearts, and hands oi woe on their beards, like drowning men catching at straws, they retired with precipitation; one to the Kurds of Turkey, and the latter sought refuge in the Fort of Roomeah. Husain Kuly Khan Afshar, who had departed before the fortunate troops set 0 ut, through the aid of Muhammed Aly Beg the Hi « IF i54 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. Arab, the Kullar Agaszy, assisted by the Balbas tribe, succeeded in taking his uncle prisoner, and capturing the fortress. This event being re ported at the foot of the splendid throne, Mirza Raza Kuly, Secretary of State, was, by the royal order, appointed to seize all his wealth; and Ashraf Khan of Damawend was selected to guard the fortress. The victorious army, proceeding by way of Maragah and Salduz, appeared, on the 6th of Muharram, in great splendor, outside the city of Roomeah. The chiefs and nobles of the surrounding districts were admitted to kiss that threshold which resembles Paradise and is replete with happiness. All the wealth, effects, goods, and insignia of authority belonging to Muhammed Kuly Khan were confiscated to the royal ex chequer, or became plunder to the victors: these were the fruits of former extortion from the pen- nyless and from the orphans, whose eyes are always streaming; or from the Fakir, to whom the plunder of a measure of flour is as the plunder of a field of corn. The silver and gold, the horses and camels, in the collecting of which this rebel had spent the capital of his life, and in the amassing of which a hundred hearts had been made to groan, were now blown about, in one day, by the storrn of events. The morning sighs of the oppressed thunder like battering-engines against the battle ments of the tyrants. After settling the affairs of Roomeah, on the 17th of the month Moharram-ul-haram, the ban ners distinguished by victory advanced, by way ol Sal mas, towards Khoie; and in a plain in the vici nity of that place the rose-coloured pavilion was erected, and rivalled the vaulted heavens.DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. CHAP. XII. AN ACCOUNT OF THE REVOLT OF HUSAIN KULY KHAN KAJAR, TUB BROTHER OF THE TRIUMPHANT SOVEREIGN ; THE REPORT MADE OF IT TO THE KINO WHEN IN AZARBA'lJAN; AND HIS MAJESTY'S RETURN, WITH THE ARMY, TO IRAK. A lthough it had been the secret purpose of the inspired mind of the victorious sovereign not to permit the signal of march towards the rose-bowers of his capital to be displayed until he had, by the assistance of his foe-consuming sword, swept away the weeds and brambles from the garden of Azar- ba'ijan, and purged it from the existence of plun derers and rebels; yet, when the account of the revolt of his infatuated brother, Husain Khan Kajar, came to his ears, he turned the reins of his world-traversing charger to the direction of Irak, for the purpose of suppressing the designs of the perfidious traitors in that province; of which the following is a clear statement. The world- subduing sovereign, on terminating the affairs of Sadik Khan, had, on his return to Teheran the capital, ornamented the brow of Husain Kuly Khan Kajar, by investing him with the sove reignty of Fars; entirely confiding, at the same time, to his erring judgment and decision all its affairs, both small and great. Upon his arrival at Shiraz, he at first placed on his neck the collar of obedience, and unfurled the banners of dependence in the lists of allegiance: but when, from stand ing in the relation of brother to his exalted ma jesty, he had attained strength and resources, then came into his head the design of revolting against him; and under pretence of the king's inexperienceDYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. and youth, he turned away his head from the line of duty; and the excitement of many persons con nected with the court, and anxious for revolt, be- i came an additional motive. Mirza Nasr Allah, who, in conformity to the order of the sovereign, protected from above, had been stationed at Shiraz, and several of the chief persons of Fars whom he found an impediment to his designs or his determined opponents, were cast into bonds and imprisonment, and afterwards deprived of sight*. He also sent a body of cavalry to seize Jan i Muhammed Khan Kajar, who was in the fortress of Lar; but he fled from thence, and with heavy and rapid speed hurried to Irak. Husain Knly Khan Kajar, on hearing this intelligence, pursued him with the greatest vigour, but was unable to overtake him. He therefore proceeded to Kashan, as he did not think it advisable to return to Shiraz. After which, circumstances occurred which obliged him to enter Irak; and he advanced as far asAbadah. The stores and baggage he sent, under the care ot Mirza Aly Karaily, to Yezdikhast; and appointed his Ghoolam, Rustam Beg Biat, to guard the city (of Shiraz) and the prisoners, while he himself, with a great force, in the middle of the month oi Muharram-ul-haram, arrived at Isfahan, the seat of learning. The inhabitants were deceived by his assertion, that the great object of this movement was respectfully to salute the threshold of his ma jesty's blessed residence ; but he took care never to open the lip of disclosure on his secret senti- * Literally, ' had a heated iron applied to his eyesan ex pression used whatever may be the mode practised for this cruel operation, which in general is the extraction by means of a knitc.DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. ments. Such was his duplicity, that if any incon siderate speaker uttered in a disrespectful manner the name of the king of the world, he tore out his tongue T, as a violet from its root. When Muham mad Aly Khan Kajar, to whose care the beneficent sovereign had committed Isfahan, reflected, that as no open act of rebellion had been displayed, and as no order had been received from the Ministers of the State to expel or oppose him, so it was to be imagined that opposition and hostility towards him, the king's brother, would be contrary to the dictates of prudence. He therefore, in conjunction with Hajy Husain Khan, Beglerbeg of Isfahan, the chiefs and other officers, quitted the city, and encamped in the vicinity; where they anxiously looked for the arrival of the supreme commands. Although several persons from Shiraz had reported the arrival of Husain Kuly Khan Kajar at Isfahan, yet the positive intelligence came to the royal hearing at Khoie. The triumphant sovereign commanded Suleiman Khan, with the chiefs and governors of Azarba'ijan, to remain there ; while he himself, like the sun in the heavens, proceeded to trak, accompanied by an army numerous as the stars. In the halting-place at Aramak in Tabreez they brought to the foot of the royal throne Mu- hammed Khan Zend, deprived of sight; which, in the commencement of this enterprise, was regarded t This phrase is sometimes used as a figurative expression for a stroil g reproof, and therefore does not necessarily imply the infliction of so barbarous a punishment: but I must add, | Kit more than once, to my own knowledge, such an act has been 'arbarously perpetrated in Persia.DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. as a happy omen. The following is a summary account of this event i—Muhammed Khan ha\iiig fled, as before described^ with a body ot the Bajilan tribe, to Kho'ie, posted himself in the fortress of Sila- khur; and, in consequence, the road to further insur rection was completely closed; for Muhammed Waly Khan, who had been ordered to repel his attacks, on arriving at Silakhur, gave him battle ; and after many engagements, Muhammed Khan, with his par tisans and associates, fled precipitately from the field of battle, and were made prisoners, in the vicinity ot Dazful and Shuster, by the bands of the Filee tribe. By the order of Hasan Khan Waly, he was de prived of the ornament of sight, loaded with fetteis and manacles, and sent to the royal court: he was afterwards, by the imperial command, delivered up to Suleiman Khan. In the station of Mianeh, in Karmazood, Abul Fatah Khan, the youngest son of Ibrahim Khan Juwan Shir, who had been ordered to appear at court, was honoured with an nitei view. In the territory of Zanjan it was reporte to the Ministers of his triumphant majesty, that on the march of the sovereign of the world from Khoie to Irak, the demons of the royal tent (i.e. slanderers, calumniators), from the tribe of Aly Himmet Khan, chief of the Kalya'y, and Khan BabaKhan, chief ot the Nankaly, had entirely perverted Suleiman Khan; although he had repeatedly said, ' The important oc- ' cupations of the throne are not suitable to awea' ' minded person like myself:' but the particles o frantic ambition were floating in the currents of ln s imagination. To arrange the execution of these treasonable designs, a congress was formed, and aIHHBBHHHBHIHBHHHIHHHHHHHi DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 59 points ol disagreement and of disunion removed: a solemn pledge was likewise given by all, that in every case they would acknowledge Suleiman Khan as their governor and chief, and utter no name, as entitled to supremacy, but his—that they would close their eyes against the claims of their bene factor, and labour only in treason and perversity. To the sovereign of high destinies, this tumult was no more than the soft notes of the lyre or the tink ling of the rebeck; and he determined, without a knot {i.e. without care) in his forehead, to proceed against them in person. His majesty encamped in the Plain of Sultaniyah, and there raised his pavilion, like the vaulted dome of the sun and moon. In this place he halted for one day, and held a general council with the chiefs of his army and the military fief-holders. After much discussion, the imperial reason, lucid as the sun, decided on this measure— that, marching by way of Hamadan and Durjezeeu, they should unsheath the hostile sword, and give battle; so that the surface of Irak might be quite liberated from the brambles and thorns of these ' wretches.' This high command (which is always a source of distinction) was therefore addressed to Muhammed Waly Khan—' that he should pro ceed with the army from the territory of Alishakr and Baroujerd; and on arriving at Gulpaijan, he should await there the arrival of the troops strengthened by Heaven, and further orders.' Ihe standards, waving in the breeze of victory, then moved from Sultaniyah; and during the march, 'usain, the son of Aly Himmet of Kalyay, and his biother, Baba Khan Nankaly, who were enrolled(jq dynasty of the kajars. among the personal attendants of the court, approv ing the treason of a father and a brother, hurried, under the absence of their senses, to the camp of Suleiman Khan; and thus, by the infatuation of these two wretches, the hostility of the revolters be came more confirmed. When this intelligence was known in the royal camp distinguished by victory, a command, irresistible as fate, was issued to dispeise the force, at the head of which was Suleiman Khan. At one of the halting-places, however, the Ministers received intelligence that Muhammed Waly Khan, on the way from Barujerd to Galpaijan, had learnt the movement of Husain Kuly Khan from Isfahan; and although he knew himself not to be inferior to any other in his participation of the royal favours, yet the attraction of relationship, joined to accord ance of diposition, had drawn him, by the reins ot delusion, to espouse the side of Husain Kuly Khan Kajar; and thus blinding his eyes to the favourable sentiments of his benefactor towards him, he joined the insurgent chief at Daha/c. CHAP. XIII. AN ACCOUNT OF THE QLEEN'S ARRIVAL, WITH HER SON HUSAIN KULY KHAN. THE RESULT OF HER COUNSELS. When the news of Husain Kuly Khan's insurrec tion came to the ears of great and small in every part of Irak, the same intelligence was also pub lished at Isfahan. It was then that the maternal love of the mighty queen, distinguished by prudence, from tenderness, boiled over, and she became vio lently agitated through grief: she frequently sentDYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. (51 to Husain Kuly Khan admonitory epistles and mes sages, both exhorting him to friendship, and direct ing him to submit and obey his brother; but he never swerved from the paths of folly. The effects of this folly brought affliction on the queen's pure soul: her royal carriage* was ordered to be loaded upon the backs of the antelope-footed, elk-like mules; and she seated herself in it, like the sun \eiled by clouds. An interview took place, by night, at the station ot Kaleh Siyah, where she poured over his dress the roses of counsel, and mournfully suspended herself to his skirts (i .e. ear nestly entreated him) to desist; but her admoni tions and her prayers were of no avail, for, in reply, he repeated this saying of Saadi: ' Cease to advise me! ' The Negro cannot be washed white.' After this, the great and orthodox queen, despairing of the effect of unavailing counsel and of Husain Kuly Khan s prosperity, turned her face towards the camp of the victorious sovereign ; hoping, perhaps, that mercy might be extended on the side of his ma jesty, so that the ties of love should not be cut asunder by the sword of aversion and hostility. She well knew the liberality of his majesty's soul, the pureness of his heart, his universal forgiveness, and great prudence; therefore this voluntary recluse behind the curtain of chastity, this noble and de- ^ 0 ted matron, once more directed the royal litter t() be fastened upon her deer-paced mules, and in * Taktravan, or Litter.q.2 dynasty of the kajars. the station of Saruk, in Ferahan, her face beamed with joy on beholding the sovereign, the light of her eyes. She discussed with him the ill-conceived, fatally-terminating projects of Husain Kuly Khan, and strongly urged to the king this excuse : The ' revenues of Fars are not sufficient for his expen- ' diture: he has therefore, without thought, com- menced this hostility, and embraced these idle ' measures: but if his imperial majesty, the be- ff stower of kingdoms, possessed of comprehensive ' views and widely-extended realms, should, in ' gratitude to God for such benefits, join to Husain ' Kuly Khan's present government the province ol ' Kerman, and deign besides, from magnanimity of ' soul, to speak comfort to the supplicant, it would ' be a proceeding of the most exalted generosity. f&lt; Husain, on his part also, would never again de- ' viate from the straight line of obedience, but ' entirely withdraw himself from insurrection and ' plunder.' To this his majesty replied : 'I have ' no reluctance to grant him the province o ' Kerman ; but what I require, in return, is, that he should not again trouble our enlightened mind by ' hostility, nor again endanger the safety of the State. On these conditions he may consider ni) ' kingdom as his own.' Husain, however, was not satisfied with Kerman, but asked for Isfahan also. His imperial majesty became indignant at this ma nifestation of his quarrelsome and evil disposition towards their exalted mother, as well as his di^ gard to the welfare of the people in general, a n therefore determined to block up the road of his pretensions; whilst he, from unquiet spirit, P lltDYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. forth other foolish claims. From this, it became evident to all, that his design was to excite tumult, and not to demand a greater revenue. The king therefoie commanded his troops to be marshalled, and his thousands drawn out in array, that the division of the kingdom might be decided by the verdict of the gold-scattering sword, the blows of the pondrous mace, the numbers of the soldiers, and the result of battle. A report having reached the enlightened Mini sters, that Husain Kuly Khan, with his deluded followers, had put on the girdle of exertion in Kamrah for the purpose of giving battle, the fire of the triumphant sovereign's indignation blazed on high; and having left the stores and heavy bag gage at that station, and appointing Mahdy Kuly Khan Kajar, with Hajy Ibrahim of Shiraz, to de- nd the camp, he gave orders to the army to march on with expedition and without baggage: and the lion-hearted king, accompanied by chosen soldiers, reared to the skies his splendid pavilion at two farsangs' distance from Husain's encampment. On Saturday, the 28th of Safar-ul-mozaffar, as soon as the General of the East, resplendent of ace, had drawn forth his sword, the foe-binding*, enemy-pursuing sovereign placed on his head the gold-ornamented, sun-resembling helmet; and bear- flg in his hand, like Closes, the life-depriving ar- s ' on his loins the lightning-flashing, word! 1 r 0rth remarkin ff how wel1 ' in respect to these compound ApI I 1 ' eulUS 0 ' t ^ e ^ language agrees with the Persian; rvawr—slaughter-gleaming. erzraig —dragon of slaughter.61 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. mountain-like falchion; mounted his high-hound ing, Pleiades-reined charger; and the army, awful as the Day of Judgment, moved from their ground. The dust raised by the countless hosts darkened and obscured the celestial mirror It was then that the king a second time endeavoured to induce him to adjust the dispute, and Mirza Musa, the Munajjem Bashy, was sent to Husain, to exhort him to obedience by words of gentleness and kindness: and by the persuasive counsels of this sage adviser, Husain awoke from the slumber ot pride, and re covered from the intoxication of vanity: ' He soon found, that Soheil, opposed to the Sun, is obscured by his splendor; ' And that the sparrow cannot free himself from the talons of the hawk.' He therefore turned his face from battle; be sought the imperial pardon for his offences and errors; and, impressed with these feelings, ran for ward and kissed the royal stirrup. The sovereign, pure in soul, embraced him; and taking him by the hand, led him from the field of battle to the hall of feasting:— ' The tongues of the arrows were shortened; the sword was re turned to its sheath; ' The world was relieved from uproar; and Tumult slunk into his den.' Waly Khan, who had so ungratefully committed open treason and rebellion, was also brought into the presence of the potent sovereign: and al though he was most deserving of chastisement, the representative of the mercy of God, in requital of his desertion, was satisfied with merely reproving * The sky.DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. ()J him. On that night both armies kept their ground; until the following morning, when the army of Husain Khan Kajar all at once arose, and joined the imperial troops. Agreeably to the commands of the kingdom-subduing sovereign, the stores and bggage arrived in the camp resembling heaven; and from thence the victorious banners advanced to Kamrah. The noblemen and chieftains from Irak and Fars, who had joined Husain Kuly Khan, having partaken of the delicious viands of pardon and indulgence from the bountiful board of the subduer of kingdoms, turned their steps to their respective countries, with the permission of the sovereign who is constantly favoured by the sign Gemini. ' If youth and good fortune be the portion of the king, let him not treat the humble harshly, ^ hen kindness can effect thy purpose, be not stern and severe.' When the account of this violence and treachery had been spread in the various provinces, all agreed that the owl of vanity had made her nest and de posited her eggs in the empty heads of these per sons. Several noblemen were therefore appointed to legulate the urgent affairs of the different pro- nnc es and districts: among these, Muhammed Aly han Kajar, who had then come from Isfahan to Join the king, proceeded to Pars; Husain Kuly han Ka An Lu to Kerman; Nurooz Khan Uz uddeen Lu to Kuh-i-Gilooh and Babahan; and e triumphant troops came from Kamrah to m (the orthodox), where the king bowed his ore head on the threshold of the glorious sanctuaryDYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. of the Mighty Prophet, and so became impressed with the figures of prosperity and security. In the middle of Rabi-ul-akhir, Teheran, the capital, was graced by the auspicious arrival there of the king; and thus its head was raised exultingly to the zenith of the heavens. CHAP. XIV. AN ACCOUNT OF THE EVENTS WHICH OCCURRED DURING HIS MA- JESTY'S RESIDENCE IN TEHERAN. (MAY THAT CITY FOR EVER BE ENCOMPASSED WITH SAFETY 1 .) A firman , irresistible as destiny, to this purport, was issued forth to Suleiman Khan, declaring, that ' as Aly Himmet Kalyany, and his son Husain, with Baba Khan Nankaly, having placed themselves in the ambush of hostility, and by their temptations ' have led astray ignorant persons, if he should ' bring them handcuffed to the royal encampment, ' the seat of victory, and deliver them to the ' criminal judge, the stain of his own crimes and ' humiliation shall be wiped from the volume ot ' f his deeds, and he shall drink of the pure stream ' of pardon.' When the exalted monarch had abode some time in the centre of empire, Suleiman Khan brought them handcuffed to Teheran, and, seating himself at the extremity of the royal chargers halter*, thus humbly set forth his voice :— 44 Two motives urged me to crime— 44 Inauspicious fortune, and imperfect reason. 44 Punishment is surely my desert; 44 Mercy my hope ;—for mercy is better than revenge.' * In the East there are, besides particular Mosques, two otbcr Places of Refuge held in a manner sacred—the outer door of the Harem or women's apartment, and the royal stables.? • cszft; • ■ &gt; i ^- v -v^ dynasty of the kajars. 67 This being accompanied by ardent expressions of shame, the crime-pardoning spirit of royal mercy was aroused, and his infidelity was requited with forgiveness; and, through his lord's bounty, the cap of his distinction was elevated to the heavens; so that he again entered the threshold of obedience, and took up his abode in the street of security. As to Aly Himmet Khan and his son, after depriving them of sight, their limbs and members were scattered in the air from the mouth of a mortar vomiting forth infernal flames. Baby Khan Nankaly, and Ab- dallah Khan, governor of Zanjan, who had com mitted so many acts of treason (among others, that of blinding Tawahkal Khan), were deprived of the ornament of vision. The government of Hamadan was bestowed on Husain Kuly Khan; and Waly Khan Kajar, in requital for his ingratitude, was banished far from the royal majesty. In those days, the Nuwab Mahmud Mirza Afghan, who, from the arrangement previously described, had, agreeably to the decree of the lord of the age, taken up his abode in the retirement of Kashan, penned anxious petitions, and solicited from the -Ministers the liberation of his hereditary dominions, and permission to set off for the accomplishment of his object. His sublime majesty granted his de- and permitted him to depart: he also issued forth these peremptory orders, which conferred distinction on the Rulers of Khorasan —' that the y&gt; having adopted the steps prescribed by zeal ^ and energy in aiding and assisting the prince, should, without difficulty, carry him to his here- ditary kingdom, i.e. Caboul, and deliver it into f 208 DYNASTY OF THE KA.IARS. ' his hand: and that they should persist in the u execution of these orders, till the object of them ' was accomplished.' From kindness to his guest, the rights of hospitality were ordered to be con tinued to him, until the prince was conveyed with honour to Yezd (the abode of piety). The details of this affair will be hereafter recounted. In the course of these events, the attendants ot the Splendid Gate reported at the foot of the celestial throne, that Jaafer Kuly Khan, during the time of the imperial sojourn in Azarba'ijan, fleeing like a bat from the rays of the sun ol prosperity, through an evil conscience, had con cealed himself in the dark recesses of Mount Mai u, and was passing his time in a desperate state among the Yezedi and Shakaki Kurds. On ie- ceiving the news of Husain Kuly Khan's revolt, he increased in boldness; and looking lor further in surrections, he, with an army of \ezedi Kurds collected from Mush and Ba'izid, and his own ad herents, besieged the fortress of Khoie, and sub jected his elder brother, Husain Khan, the governoi, to the distress of a siege. Husain Khan repre sented the nature of his position to the royal court, and prayed for assistance : an order was instantl) issued, that Ibrahim Khan Kajar Davalu should set out with a resolute army; and, having collected his adherents and troops in Azarba'ijan, should ad vance to Khoie, and deliver Husain Khan from the distress of a siege. • Ibrahim Khan immediately set out from the imperial residence; and, in conceit with the cavalry and infantry of the country, ha v ' ing descended from Mount Ghazan, near Khoie,f'' I ■ DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 69 Husain Khan joined him from the fort. Jaafer Kuly Khan, being informed of this, came to meet him; and between them there ensued a mighty battle and formidable concussion, which continued from midday until evening. In one moment, great numbers of the Yezedi and Shakaki tribes writhed in the dust, and a river of blood flowed outside of Khoie. Jaafer Kuly Khan, as his for tune forsook him, fled from the field of battle, with his adherents ; the victorious troops pursuing, and putting all they overtook to the sword.* Nu merous herds and powerful steeds became the prey of the valiant champions; while Jaafer Kuly Khan, according to his usual practice, after a thousand stratagems, reached the Kurdish tents. Such of the prisoners as were of the Dambali tribe were, through the intercession of Husain Khan, set at liberty by the world-subduing sovereign; but the Kurds were beheaded. The chiefs of the army were clothed in splendid dresses, taken from the imperial wardrobe ; and Ibrahim Khan, in ad dition to his dress, had his girdle adorned with a diamond-studded dagger. This noble order was then issued: *' That the condition of the cultivators and soldiers may be benefitted, let the army break U P; but let the troops remain in quarters at Ta- breez, ready to execute such orders as the king ' may issue.'70 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. CHAP. XV. AN ACCOUNT OF FIXING THE GOLDEN GATE ON THE SILVER SHRINE OF THE HOLY MASUMAH*, &amp;C. As the keys of divine grace had opened to the for tunate sovereign, upright in manner, pure in faith, humane in sentiment, the gates of successive vic tories, the world-subduing energy of his mind de termined, that, in return for such gifts and bounties, he would implore assistance from the interior re cesses of the abodes of the Prince of Prophets, and the Chiefs of orthodoxy, the Lords of small and great (on whom be peace!); since the contraction or expansion, the binding or loosening, of human affairs are in their hands, and the regal authority is sup ported by them. He therefore commanded that the grace-abounding dome and sanctuary of the pure, prophetic female, descendant of Imaum Mouza, a virgin, whose honoured fathers and ancestors, up to Adam, had been either Imaums or Prophets king ordered, that, previous to finishing the gilding of the dome, a golden gate should be fixed at the threshold, leading to this resting-place of cherubims: when skilful artificers and profound mathemati cians emulated each other in the performance ot the task; and so constructed a gate of such beauty, * The tomb here spoken of is that of Fatima, daughter of Mousa Kazem VII.

By order also of the or thodox sovereign, Cheragh Aly Khan Nuw'ai bore to Koom (the Devout) this gate, brilliant as the sun, and fixed it in its proper place; and the gild ing of the splendid dome, agreeably to the king's commands, was at the same time fully completed. Thus this excellent monument of piety exists in the world, inscribed with the illustrious name of the so vereign powerful as Jamshid ; and immense sums of money, and considerable revenues, were expended on this blessed happy undertaking, which caused the hopes of all true Believers to be strengthened ; the proud and poor alike continually uttering prayers for the king's glory and prosperity. Besides this, his majesty ordered to be erected, in his extensive dominions, various hospitals, charitable foundations, and beautiful edifices, the enumeration of which would cause us to be accused of prolixity. We may however state, out of so many buildings, the Kajar Palace, and the College of Koom, two Para dise-like structures, which were successively erected, and which shall be concisely noticed when occasion requires. At this period, news came to the hear ing of the Ministers and counsellors of his majesty, that the spirit of Husain Khan Dambaly had taken wing to the abode of eternity ; also, that Jaafer Kuly Khan, at the request of the rabble of Khoie, who w ere exceedingly attached to him, had, with great expedition, entered the fort, and assumed his bro thers place. After an interval of some days, humble r epi esentations to this effect were presented from him, at the court of the victorious sovereign :—' If72 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. the sun of royal benevolence should deign to shine on me, I shall be able to follow and emulate ' the example of my elder brother, in loyal obe- ' dience and devotedness of soul.'' Although the | sovereign, glorious as the heaven, had repeatedly witnessed his fraud and treachery, and that his words and deeds were always opposed to each other, and though this was strongly reflected on the mental mirror of the lord of the world, yet, however, this order, powerful as destiny, was issued :—' It Jaafer ' Kuly Khan be sincere in the declaration of obe- ' dience, and desirous of faithfully serving the king, 4&lt; let his son proceed to our celestial court; and let ' him thus remove the mist of ambiguity, by the ' demonstration of sincere submission ; so that in 4 4 proportion to the purity of his sentiments he may ' participate in the royal bounty.' At this very time, Husain Kuly Khan, being alarmed at his pre ceding evil actions, had secretly planned a retreat into Khorasan ; but his dependants not only refused to follow him, but even prevented him in his pur pose. He therefore, through fear, on the day oi this occurrence, requested, by petitions from the ministers of the resplendent sanctuary, u that as the ' revenues of Samanan are insufficient for his ex- ' penses, another district might be added to it, so that his income might equal his expenditure; and ' also set forth, that the compliance with this request ' would be an unequivocal manifestation of the kings ' generous disposition.' His request was granted, and the splendor of the government of Kashan, and its district, was reflected upon the mansion ot hi&gt; deeds. As he was greatly pained by being cliiW'DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 73 less, his majesty sent the illustrious Prince Mu- hammed Tuky Mirza * with him to Kashan, with orders that he should be always with his uncle, tran- quillise his heart, and so deliver him from the bitter bonds of anxiety. The government of Samanan was committed to the fortunate prince, Muhammed Waly Mirza; and the district of Kazwin was gra ciously conferred on the illustrious prince, Muham med Waly Mirza. CHAP. XVI. AN ACCOUNT OF THE ERECTION OF THE KAJAR PALACE. T he world-adorning taste of the king caused him to direct that a spot of ground, replete with at tractions, and situated about half a league from Teheran, should be laid out in a garden like the celestial Paradise, filled with all sorts of trees and odoriferous plants; and that on the summit of a hill, resembling a mound of pure amber, which commanded that garden, there should be con structed a heart-attracting residence. A decree, therefore, resistless as destiny, went forth, that the architects and gardeners should combine to display all their talents on this favoured spot. At that hour, which sometimes happens to For tune's favourites, there was formed a garden of such beauty, that the splendor of its roses excited env y in the^ bosom of the roses of Paradise, and the meandering of its limpid waters outshone those of the Fountain of Life. Some parts of its surface being unequal, the hollows were filled up with sifted * That is, the king saddled his a nd expenses of one of his sons. brother with the maintenance74 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. earth ; and in others the hillocks removed, so as to form a continued and perfect level. Fruit-pro ducing trees * of every sort and country, odoriferous shrubs, vernal and autumnal flowers, were planted in every part of it. It was crowned by a delightful structure; and a Paradise-like abode, ornamented with firm bastions, strong curtains, and parapets. In front stood a lake; in the midst of which boiled up a fountain, like the Fountain of the Sun, spout ing forth waters more lucid than the celestial mirror. At this auspicious moment, a firman was also issued to repair and gild the pure dome of the King of Martyrs; the explanation of which is as follows. Through ignorance, and the hurry of those who were charged by the late monarch to embellish the celestial dome covering the remains of the Lord of Martyrs at Kerbela, and from their not having accurately calculated the strength of the foundation, the dome gave way, rent asunder, and its gold-coloured bricks began to assume a lunar appearance: but in this same year, a faithful super- intendant was appointed to remove the heaven- resembling dome; and to build another, of such solidity, that it should receive no injury in the revo lutions of months and years; and that gold of so perfect standard should be used, as to remain un tarnished in the vicissitudes of days and nights f. * Pure Welsh, Frwythalwg —fruit-cherishing. t The real state of this story is: Aga Muhammed Khan, the king's uncle, had determined to cover the dome at Kerbela with copper bricks plated with gold, in the same manner as the dome at Meshed Ally. But when the cost of the work came to be calcu lated, Aga Muhammed found to plate the bricks amounted to 8° largeDYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 75 Praise be to the Almighty, that, through the archi tectural wisdom of the orthodox sovereign, this pure vault became more solid than the empyreal vaults of the sky, and was covered with golden bricks more resplendent than the glorious sun!

' God is the only source of prosperity and assistance.' CHAP. XVII. AN ACCOUNT OF THE OCCURRENCES OF THE YEAR 1214 OF THE HE- JIRA (A.

When the world-enlightening sun directed his face to the fortunate ascendency, the frost-clad hosts of winter turned their backs to flight on the ap pearance of the gaily-clad armies of the spring. The tender herbage and the odoriferous plants put forth their heads in the gardens; whilst the tulip and lily, rejoicing in the meads, quaffed the goblet in the society of the Narcissus and the wild rose.

The monarch who now reposes in the exalted heavens* had already rent asunder the links of king Shah Rokh's do minion, as well as the thread of his existence: his son, Jsadir Mirza, abandoned the threshold of the prince of the throne of resignation, Imaum Reza (on whom rest salutations and benedictions!), and took shelter with the Afghans, where he remained until the news of the melancholy fate of the de ceased monarch was spread far and wide in Kho rasan. On that sad event, the victorious troops retired from Khorasan ; and the present victorious sovereign was obliged to occupy himself in extin guishing the flames excited by the rebellion of Sadik Khan Shakaky, and in arranging the affairs of Azarba'ijan. Nadir Mirza regarding this as a favourable opportunity, advanced to Meshed the Holy, and stationed himself in that sacred district. Indeed, on his arrival, he despatched, to the foot of the exalted throne, petitions, with humble entreaties, indicating submission and allegiance; but from these the odour of sincere fidelity never refreshed the senses of the Ministers of the celestial court. VVhen all the chiefs of Khorasan, excepting the Ameer Guneh Khan, governor of Kabushan, and Allah Yar Khan, governor of Sabzawar, joined the royal retinue, and in pursuance of the all-powerful command had obtained the honour of kissing the celestial threshold, then, for the first time, appeared * Aga Muhammed Khan.DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS, 77 in arms the vigorous scion of the rose of fortune and prosperity, the new moon in the orbit of dignity and splendor. Prince Abbas Mirzaf, a blaz ing star in the heav en of dominion, a bright planet in the sphere of spiritual power, munificent in nature, vigorous in action, polished in manner, noble in lineage, refined in taste. He was emi nently distinguished: on his head shone the crescent-shaped diadem of succession ; on his finger blazed the signet of planetary influence, denoting royal delegation; and with fifteen thousand bold horsemen, ^ Whose sole employment was to exercise the straight lance, ' Whose sole delight was the sword of Indian steel,' he was commanded to advance to Azarba'ijan, and subdue the refractory chiefs of that quarter. As the victorious prince was now in the bloom of youth, and in the commencement of military com mand and the assault of foes, the Minister of State, auleiman Khan Kajar, by order of the highly- gnified sovereign, accompanied the prince's tri umphant retinue. A firman was also issued to Ibrahim Khan Kajar—who, by the royal command, ad remained at Tabreez—to attach himself to the evoted train of the fortunate prince.

About this time, Muhammed Aka*, son of Divan Effendi, arrived at the court, durable as the heavens, on the part of Suleiman Pasha W aly ot Bagdad, with suitable presents, and horses of the purest Arabian breed. He partook ot the royal munificence, and was permitted to depart. After this, the triumphant troops, surrounded with great splendor, began their march towards Khorasan. At the station of Dolab, the son of Jaafer Kuly Khan Dambaly, who had been ordered to the presence, was honoured by kissing the curtain of the king's tent. Husain Kuly Khan, from Kashan, also arrived at the court, the asylum of the world, the seat of true Believers. J an Muhammed Khan Kaj ar.

Now the object of the king's illustrious mind was the liberation of the fort of Meshed of Reza (to whom be salutation and P r aise!), and the chastisement of Nadir Mirza: he therefore commanded a body of musketeers, with skilful officers, to garrison the ark or citadel of Nisha- 30 or, and that the exalted train should set out on their proposed march for that delightful region, aafer Khan Biyat, not being firmly rooted in the gaiden of allegiance, secretly sent this message to his pole's sons ' As long as you are able, post your selves resolutely in the path of hostility: by no (f mean s permit the victorious army to enter the fort; an d» as long as possible, place not your feet in the80 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. ' path of obedience.' From the issuing of this order, the angry flame of royal indignation blazed up to the celestial sphere: but the king's mercy always out strips his wrath; he sent to the fort Hajy Ibrahim of Shiraz, and Mirza Shafia the vizir, with power to decide all differences, and direct the people of the fort to their true interests. Husain Kuly Beg by name, one of Jaafer Khan's cousins, kindled in the secret temple of his heart the light of counsel from these trusty advisers, and, having tranquillized the inhabitants of the fort, hastened to the court, the asylum of justice : the inhabitants, however, on Husain Kuly Beg's departure, again entered on the desert of opposition and hostility: in conse quence of which, a firman, powerful as fate, was issued, ' to lay waste the country outside the fort, and closely to besiege Nishaboor.' The sage monarch's troops, like the waves of the ocean, or a red plague sent from Heaven, hastened to surround the city; and having encircled the fort like the bezel of a ring, they kindled the fire of destruction in the environs of the city, and spread to the wind the banners of rapine. Jaafer Khan, on witnessing the flame of imperial wrath, sunk down as the ashes of a consumed coal*, and prayed to be per mitted to go into the fort, for the purpose of con ciliating the people. The victorious sovereign, hav ing commanded that his son and Husain Kuly Bcj, should be detained at court, permitted him to de part : but no sooner had he entered the fort, than, from his innate depravity, he concealed himself behind the wall of hostility, and exerted himselt in * This appears a beautiful simile.ingjaaii DYNASTY OP THE KA.IARS. offensive operations. The stormy ocean of his majesty's (the shadow of God) wrath raised thus violently by the gale of treason, the waves of it ascended to the zenith; so that, according to the orders of the lord of the sphere of dominion, the executioners broke the charm of the body of Jaafer Khan's son with the iron-cleaving sword, and divi ding his members into morsels, scattered them on the surface of the earth, and discoloured the stones and clay with his blood. These were afterwards sent to the evil-disposed father, whose infatuated hand had destroyed the life and youth of his own child, and caused his head, hands, and feet to be separated from his body. Husain Kuly Beg re ceived the honourable title of Khan; and had his bosom and shoulders decorated with robes radiant as the sun. A firman was now issued to the vic torious army to take Nishaboor. Every morning, when the sun poured forth light from his celestial sp ere, the area of the fort, from the firing of Hnon and musketry, was enveloped in flame, 80 that the inhabitants of the place had a perfect spectacle of the Day of Judgment. The besiegers now filled up the water-courses which supplied ^ty, and the destructive axe or overpowering hatchet was employed to fell the fruit-trees. During orty days the people of the castle were placed on e r ack-wheel of torture, or confined to the dark ungeon of punishment: at last, worn out, they had to j 0UrSe to en ^ re aty; their plaints and cries ascended We ' and wee P in g and wailing in the desert of a 'ness and astonishment, they became aware of ondition to which Jaafer Khan had reducedg&lt;2 DYNASTY OF THE KAJAHS. them: they therefore sent Hajy Ruh Alamin, one of the most eminent and learned men ot that country, accompanied by a cousin of Jaaler Khan s, to the heroic sovereign's equity-established court, to he- seech for pardon, indulgence, and the royal mercy. These petitions of the citizens were granted; and the Mulla Aly Asghar, the royal tutor, was appointed to conciliate the people of Nishaboor. Seeing this, Jaafer Khan Nishaboory turned the face of supplica tion to the bright court, and rubbed his forehead on the dust of the threshold of the pavilion guarded by Saturn ; when, in addition to pardon for his crimes, his breast and shoulders were adorned with robes radiant as the sun, he was honoured and exalted y royal patents assigning to him the government ot Nishaboor, and was permitted to depart in honour and safety from the royal Durbar, the seat ot equity. Terab Khan Baroujerdy, one of the fortunate train, was appointed, with a body of musketeers, to gar rison Nishaboor. Notwithstanding the king's work- adorning mind was aware of the rebellious heart an treasonable designs of Sadik Khan Shakaky, yet, account of the exigency of the times, his majesty bore to notice his foul deeds ; and neithc i punis nor reproved him, but left him in the cominai of those troops whose chief he was, and directed nn to form a junction with Jan Muhammed Khan K J ^ and to undertake, in concert with him, the siege the fortress of Meshed the Holy.

Nadir Mirza took refuge in the fort. The formidable royal host then, like a circle, surrounded it on all sides. The villages and corn-fields were plundered and ravaged; but the sincere faith of the orthodox sovereign to wards the holy prelates (on all of whom may bless ings rest!) induced him to regard with due venera tion the sanctuary of Reza, and to take into account the evils which must accrue to the inhabitants of Meshed, which city resembles the celestiarmansions; and he therefore gave no orders for reducing the fort. Nadir Mirza, from the midst of this whirlpool of calamity, sought to reach the shore of safety by embarking on the skitf of weakness and contrition, from which he poured forth this intercession :—' If ' the unrivalled sovereign should entrust the for- ' tress to me, his devoted servant, it will proclaim ^ the unlimited compassion and boundless gene- J rosity of the sovereign of the world: and to ^ stiengthen the ties of allegiance and sincere friend- S ^P between us, I propose to bind in the silken konds of marriage one of the retired and chaste P™ c esses, to whichsoever of the princes, his sons, the beneficent sovereign may think proper.'— - s the conciliation of dependants, and giving aid to t e fallen, is the distinction of liberal minds, his re quests were crowned with success, and the gates of prosperity were opened for the admission of his opes.

Ameer Gunah Khan was presented with a robe, and permitted to depart; and Mirza Muhammed Shafia, the vizir, was despatched in concert with him, to bring Nadir Mirza's illustrious and noble daughter to the abode of Prince Husain Aly Mirza, at the station of Arghanan. Jaafer Khan Biyat ob tained permission to return to Nishaboor; and the retinue, numerous as the stars, next halted at four parasangs from Ak Kelah. Sadik Khan having ar ranged a league of sincerity with Aly ^ ar Khan, treacherously spread the carpet oi fraud in the council-chamber, and solicited from his majesty (the shadow of the Almighty) permission for Aly lar Khan to depart, under the pretext, ' that, before ' the arrival of the royal retinue at the capital, he, ' having gone to his fort, might turn his attention ' to his most urgent concerns, that is, the prepara- 4 4 tion of his tributary presents, and supplies of corn ' and forage for the army; so that, on the arrival ot ' the splendid retinue, the want of these things ' should not cause him shame and confusion.'-— The victorious sovereign, having exalted him by a royal dress, permitted him to depart; but observed, in the language of inspiration, ' This departure is without return.' Aly Yar Khan, on arriving at his fort, drew over his face the black veil of treachery, and, though he never quitted the castle, shewed clearly his wicked designs : but as his majesty's gracious mind was desirous to return to the capital, he attached noDYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 85 importance to the termination of this affair, and therefore displayed the banner of departure from Ak Kelah towards the fortunate residence. Having conferred suitable distinctions on Ibrahim Khan Shad Lu, governor of Asfarayin, and on Saadat Kuly Khan Baghairy, he permitted them to depart to their respective abodes. In this place the Asaf of the State, Mirza Muhammed Shafia, conveyed to the royal camp, resembling the heavens, the Prin cess, concealed behind the veil of chastity. At the station of Pul Abrishim, from which to Kalatah there are fourteen parasangs, the route is destitute of water and forage :— ' lu this, nothing moves but the star; ' In this, nothing 1 flies but the wind: The earth resembles a fiercely blazing fire ; ' And a lizard there is like a fish in a frying-pan.' It was from this place the army, numerous as the stars, or like clusters of planets, made a night-march, fhe Ministers of Fate and Omnipotence let fall the curtain of darkness from the roof of heaven; and the azure sky, with its thousand bright eyes, tore asunder the line of guidance ; so that the victorious troops in that desert, full of dangers, lost their road, and were wandering and moving about like the starry hosts in the expanse of heaven. The horsemen however, roaming about in every direction, were a hle to reach the border of safety; and when the ^orld-enlightening sun arose from the eastern hori zon, numbers of the infantry had dropped through fatigue; but when he ascended to the zenith of the s ky, the intensity of the heat was so increased, that the steel armour on the warrior's breast re-tasted the86 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. heat of the blacksmith's forge. The infantry, ex hausted by thirst, parched up, wailing, and unable to stand, resigned their hearts to despair. On the arrival of the auspicious retinue at Kalatah, the in telligence concerning the thirsty wanderers in the valley of affliction was made known to his majesty and the Ministers of the fortunate threshold; and, notwithstanding the heaven-traversing steeds had already performed a journey of fourteen parasangs (i, e. about fifty-six miles), the king did not abandon the thirsty, but gave this order to the Ghoolams of the royal guard and the Ameers: ' Fill whatever ' water-Skins and bags can be found, with water; and, ' with a rapidity greater than that of the flashing ' lighning, and more uninterrupted than the showers ' of the rain-pouring clouds, let them be conveyed ' to the troops.' The sovereign, (endowed with the Messiah's breath and Khazar's auspicious step,) from that abundant beneficence and mercy which is a part of his majesty's angelic essence, vivified in this manner the souls of the multitude who despaired of existence, and presented to them the pure beve rage of life : so thus those who had directed their re pose to the dark caverns of annihilation had now their pillow visited by the beams of the healthful sun, and, though standing on the precipice of destruction, were, by the king's humanity, transported to the abodes of life and existence. The army, with whom victory fixes her abode, halted during one day at Kalatah, to take some repose; and on the next the triumphant flags were unfurled, and the pavilion, magnificent as the heavens, was pitched outside 13us- tam. Husain Kuly Khan, who was living in greatDYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 87 tranquillity at Firoz-Koh, received an increase of honour by saluting the imperial stirrup. His majesty then halted at Damaghan; and the stores and bag gage being sent forward, the king moved on by way of Chesmeh Aly, for the purpose of enjoying the pleasures of the chase in those mountains and plains. On the fifteenth of Rabi-ul-akhir he bestowed that splendor on the capital which the spirit confers on the body, or which the breath of the world-adorning spring sheds over the meadows. CHAP. XVIII. AN ACCOUNT OF THE ADVANCE OF THE VICTORIOUS BANNERS OF PRINCE ABBAS MIRZA, THE SUCCESSOR TO SPIRITUAL AND TEM PORAL POWER, TOWARDS AZARBA'IJAN.—THE REDUCTION OF THE FORT 0¥ HUDARt AND THE DISCOMFITURE OF JAAFER KULY KHAN. P revious to the departure for Khorasan of his sub lime majesty, the shadow of God, command had been given, as before stated, to the pearl ot abso lute power and universal sway, the sun of the heaven of triumph and grandeur, the successor to spiritual and temporal authority. Prince Abbas Mirza, to chastise the rebels of Azarba'ijan. On the return of his imperial majesty to Teheran, ' Fame filled this aged expanse (the world) with the report ' That the Sultan had seated himself on his throne.' Then the intelligent bearers of news reported to the devoted Ministers of the world-protecting court, that the mighty prince, on arriving at Tabreez, the seat of dominion, had halted a few days, to give his army repose, and afterwards marched to Chemen i Yam. As Jaafer Kuly Khan, after his88 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. brother's decease and his own entrance into the Fort of Kho'ie, had sent his son to the court magni ficent as the heaven, and thus pledged himself to continue in loyalty and obedience, the prince, pos sessed of Manucheher's presence, and prudent as Houshung, in order to prove the sincerity of the declarations of this person (who, being intoxicated by the wine of infatuation, was wandering in the deserts of error), sent to him one of the royal courtiers, and intimated to him a wish to bestow on him the happiness of an interview: but am bition, deceitful as Satan, had stuffed too much of the cotton of infatuation into his ears, for the advice or counsels of the illustrious sages to recall his distracted reason, or for the admonitions of the sincere and intelligent to induce him to em brace the means of prosperity and safety, and fix his abode in the street of good reputation. As his per severance in hostility and arrogance, and his clinging to the robe of fraud and deceit, had become mani fest to the counsellors of the Saturnian sphere, they accounted his punishment a necessary and an in cumbent duty. The victorious banners were there fore unfurled, and moved in the direction of Salmas, for the purpose of battle and encounter. When Jaafer Kuly Khan learned the advance of the Vice gerent, he left one of his brothers in the Fort of Khoie, and went himself among the Kurds (of evil origin), to procure aid and supplies, and assemble troops. He drew together fifteen thousand soldiers, partly from Erivan, and the tribes Yezcli Shakak and Sabiki, and, substituting treason for gratitude to his benefactor, prepared for battle. The Eels,DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 89 and other tribes in the territory of Khoie and Sal- mas, alarmed by the army, awful as the Day of Judgment, sought refuge in various fortified places; amongst which was the Fort of Hudar, which rival led in strength and solidity the structures of the Ninth Heaven:— ' From its turrets, the inhabitants held Intercourse with angels; ' t rom Its cliffs, the eagles soared in company with those of the constellation; ' A vulture might reach its summit in a twelvemonth; ' And a hawk might arrive at the foot of it in a month.' Ihe fort contained immense riches, and was garri soned by warlike champions; but to that period, the thought of the most powerful monarch had never reached beyond the contemplation of the side of its terrace. Notwithstanding this, the steel-hearted troops from every quarter hesitated not to under take the reduction of so seemingly an impregnable ^ort; whilst the garrison, commanded and encou raged by Abdal Aka Kurd of Sabik (who, on the part of Jaafer Kuly Khan, defended this strong fortification and mighty bulwark), placed their feet m the circle of opposition, and, with firm reliance on the strength of the place, employed their hands 111 wielding the sword and spear. The army, rapid as ^ghtning, made a general assault, and in the first onset took this mighty fortress by storm. W ith the well-tempered edge of their flaming swords they committed the terrene existence of these vile wretches to the wind of ruin, and made most of them swallow the draught of destruction and deso- lation. The wealth which the inhabitants of that ( ountry had, in the course of so many years, col-90 DYNASTY OF THE KAfARS. lected and stored up, became, in one instant, the ho object of plunder, and the subject of spoil and de- th( vastation. 1 When the affair of Hudar had been thus termi- | nated, and the thorns of rebel-existence burned up by the flame of the enemy-subduing, foe-annihilating sword, the triumphant forces of the prince, splendid as Feridoon, turned themselves to the chastisement i of the refractory. Jaafer Kuly Khan, with fifteen ^ thousand men of demon-like appearance, mostly b a Kurds, composing the garrison of Khoie, and with | y the government artillery which he took from that ! ^ place with excessive boldness and fool-hardiness, ca advanced one station forward, resolved to offer battle to and contest to the Prince-Viceroy. By Jaafer Kuly I fa Khan's directions, the country people, during several bo successive days, had overflown the Plain of Salmas j f] with water; in order that the prince's troops, eager | Sa for the battle, plunging their feet in mud and clay, | mi should not be able to extricate themselves from so gjj terrible an abyss : however, ultimately, the advan- hi tage of that fraud and device recoiled on his own | ba army, as all his cavalry which descended into the , co soft clay became the prey of the well-tempered br sword. Finally, the illustrious prince, on the 7th ot N, Rabi-ul-akhir, in the vicinity of Deelmakan, in the hij neighbourhood of Salmas, in conjunction with the i ^ Prime-minister, Suleiman Khan Kajar, Ibrahim Khan Kajar, and Ahmed Khan Mukaddam, Begler- th beg of Tabreez and Maragah, drew out in line of battle his right, left, centre, and wings, and corps of W{ reserve*—a countless host, the pressure of whose * Literally, ' guard of ambush.'DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 91 horses' hoofs scattered the globe of the earth into the air, like the eddies of sand by the wind :— ' The ears of heaven were deafened by the shouts of the heroes; ' And the neighing of the steeds, rapid as lightning, silenced the thunder: ' The Hash of their swords roused the celestial Eagle from her nest in the constellation.' The valiant champions on both sides, now posting themselves in the lists of bravery, caused the fire of battle and strife to exhibit its brightest flame. The infantry, terrible as Mars, furious as tigers, applying the match to the volcanic chambers of the mortars, camel-guns, and muskets, dealt the flames of hell to their enemies' souls, and with the fiery blast of destruction and death burned up the demon-like bodies of the Kurds, their innately-depraved foes. The clangor of the trumpet distracted the aged Saturn seated in his lofty palace; whilst the un matched horseman of the fourth sphere (i. e. Sa gittarius), in the expanse of heaven, deviated from bis regular course, by the tumult of the field of battle and the dusty darkness arising from this conflict. Amidst this darkness, the poniard of the brave shone like the teeth of the laughing Ethiop. Now the demon-like flame of calamity mounts on Wgh, from the shocks and concussions of this dread assemblage of warriors; and the tremen dous image of the Resurrection is manifested in sublunar world: the fire-scattering cannon, swivels, and muskets, turned the gall of Mars t to w ater, and the body of Saturn became parched. ^ To use a vulgar expression, 44 Mars became white-livered.'92 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. The countenance of the Moon assumed a dark hue; the path of the Milky-Way was burned up; and the earth's surface, from the world-illuminating ex plosions, resembled the sulphureous area of the hall of the Last Judgment. In short, the foe-subduing army of the prince (splendid as Feridoon) having ob tained the victory over the insane enemy, Jaafer Kuly Khan, afterhis just and severe defeat, borrowing speed from the lightning and the wind, sought refuge in the Fort of Maku, one of the lofty forts of Khachur. The stores, baggage, artillery, and military chest of his army was shared amongst the victors. These brave men, bold as Houshung, with spears like Gee'u, and with drawn swords, pursued the multitude devoted to an evil end : whomsoever they came up with felt the weight of their merciless falchion ; and thus many heads as well as prisoners were laid at the feet of the Vicegerent. The military chiefs and courtiers in attendance upon the vigilant prince, elated by a victory which might have rejoiced the spirit of Pir Dastan*, the echo of which might fill the vault of heaven to the last link in the chain of time, placed the foot of glory on the head of the Furka- danf, and fixed the basis of their elevation above the Seven Heavens. This victory opened wide the portals of security and prosperity to Azarba'ijan. The fame-seeking prince having come to Kho'ie, ordered Pir Kuly Khan Kajar, of Sham Biyaty, to remain there; and the victorious forces, moving from Kho'ie, arrived at Tabreez.

The gardener of the royal garden of justice scientifically extended the benefit of equitable irri gation over the face of all the villages and grounds capable of cultivation: the falcon and the dove, the hawk and the sparrow, nestled together ; the tiger and the deer, the mountain-goat and the lion, re posed side by side. Those who conveyed the in telligence of this celebrated victory to the mighty sovereign's Durbar, the centre of the world, received from the munificent treasury of the monarch (at tended by Saturn) robes of gold tissue, and quaffed from the tavern of his generosity dregless wine, in the delightful goblets of favour and condescension.

Equally de lighted and triumphant, he appointed his son Kam- ran Mirza to the government of Ferah ; whilst he himself, with Ameer Aly Khan, and an army ardent for battle, saddled the charger of enterprise, and iDYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 95 urged the steed of victory on to Herat, at length pitching his tents outside that city (beautiful as Pa radise). During twenty days he employed every exertion to capture the city ; but still the beloved object of desire, standing behind the curtain of Destiny *, removed not the veil from her face; and the Afghans, who had joined Mahmud Mirza, now permitting themselves to be seduced by the lures of Kaisar Mirza, plundered his camp, and afterwards dispersed themselves. When Mahmud Mirza, from the revolution of varying fortune, beheld his faithless mistress reconciled to the enemy of his prosperity, his colour became changed, the standard of his for tunes sunk, his face was purpled with tears of blood, and he fled with precipitation. Mir Aly Khan Ka'iny also drew off his forces, and directed his march to Ka'in. Kamran Mirza in like manner, greatly dis appointed, retired from Ferah to Yezd; and repre sented, by letters to the just court, the events which had occurred. The year before, when the banners distinguished by victory had been unfurled in the direction of Khorasan, Jehangir Khan of Gulpaijan was ordered by the sovereign command to Yezd (the abode of true worshippers), to conduct Firooz and Kamran towards Herat; so that on the victorious sovereign's arrival in that region, the governors of Khorasan, pursuant to the decrees resembling those * This figure is by no means confined to the Persian, but is to be met with, not unfrequently, in the Bible:— ' The Virgin, the daughter of Zion, hath despised thee, and laughed thee to scorn: ' The Daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee.' 2 Kings, xix. 21. pft MrDYNASTV OF THE KAJARS. of Heaven, should proceed with them, and seat the princes on the throne: but as some delay took place in the arrival of the auspicious retinue, partly from the time consumed in the reduction of Nishaboor, and partly from the siege of the holy territory (Me shed), the bride of their desire put not forth her face from the curtain of concealment. On the arrival of the royal household at Teheran (the seat of govern ment), the two princes, along with Jehangir Khan, came to the imperial court. His majesty, the shadow of God, conferred favours on them: and when they had rested a few days and recovered from the fatigue of travelling, by the king's command they set out for Isfahan, in order that, by passing a short time in surveying the delightful scenes of that heart- attracting region, the pains of exile might be ba nished ; until&gt; at the proper moment, the world-illu minating policy of the sovereign should again lay the foundation of their prosperity and sovereignty. Mahmud Mirza continued his flight from before Herat without interruption, and threw the reins ol his will on the neck of the steed of Destiny. He fled, in all directions, like a whirlwind, over mountain and plain. After some days he arrived at Merv Shah Jehan, and went from thence to Bokhara*. Relying on the conformity of the religion and faith of the in habitants of those countries, he hoped by their means to open the gates of prosperity with the hand of sup plication ; and he therefore grasped the skirts ot Shah Morad Usbeg, commonly called Beggi/ Jan- But after a short time, observing, from his manner. * The inhabitants of Bokhara are Sunnis, as are the Afghans-DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 97 that the image of assistance and generosity was not reflected from the mirror of Beggy Jan's mean spirit, he departed from thence to Kharezm, under the pre text of making a pilgrimage to the House of God (Mecca). As the governor of that province was in the bond of sincerity and allegiance with the victo rious sovereign, he therefore noticed his arrival with great respect, and furnished him with all the neces sary means for reaching the celestial court; where, on his arrival, the equitable monarch also received him with augmented favour; and, by his intimation. Prince Mahmud took up his quarters in the abode of his majesty's Prime-minister, the Vizir Mirza Mu- hammed Shafia, who, in conformity to the command of the incomparable sovereign, displayed the great est zeal in treating him with respect and honour, daily conferring on him happiness and distinction, by presents from the treasury of the friend-protect ing, enemy-consuming monarch. In like manner, the Afghan chiefs, who in all the varieties of his fortunes, whether of elevation or depression, distress or affluence, had travelled in the road of sincerity a nd faithfully performed the duties of sympathy and loyal service towards him, partook of the royal munificence and benevolence, in proportion to their respective ranks.

Nobles and princes, from all quarters, directed their steps to the court of the world-subduing monarch; the managers of bridal festivities began to ornament the streets, to em bellish the porticoes and dwellings, and to decorate every apartment with astonishing pictures and drawings. The musicians, with harmonious lays, imparted fresh ardour to banquets resembling those of Paradise; the fiery-handed pyrotechnists, in lightning-scattering flames, composed the forms of raging lions and the figures of furious elephants; the magic-versed jugglers, delusive as fortune, with a single hand exhibited thousand-handed tricks ; and during one week, the high and the humble, openly and secretly, passed their time in mirth and happiness.

The communication made to the king on this occasionDYNASTY OF THE KA.IARS. 101 was as follows:—'Whereas the Almighty having ' placed the reins of government over the people ' of Iran in the powerful grasp of his sublime ' majesty, who has opened wide, before the face of ' young and old, the portals of excellent institutions: ' and as dignity and splendor have decorated the ' cheeks of the graceful beauty of his prosperity u with imperishable ornaments, and have purged the ' rose-garden of his fortune from the brambles and ' thorns of loss and disgrace, it is wished to renew ' the compacts contained in the ancient treaties ' existing between these two great empires.'— In consequence of this, on the part of the highly- dignified Ruler of England, an intimation was given to the Ruler of the realms of Hindustan, who by his sovereign's command had displayed the banners of absolute power in that climate, that he should des patch some of his confidential agents with curious presents from Hindustan, and rare gifts from the English realms, to the court, the asylum of the world; and should at the same time write a Letter, containing congratulations to his majesty, and com prehending assurances of friendship. Conformably to the king's intimation, the exalted Mirza Mehedy Aly Khan, entitled Behadur Hashmet Jung, origi nally from Khorasan, and eminent for understand- ,n g, arrived at court in the end of Rabi-ul-awwal. fhe Mirza presented the Letters and presents, with which he was charged, to his sublime majesty; and, in return, became an object of the favour and muni- ^ence of the monarch of the universe. At this period there also arrived eloquent Envoys102 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. from Tippoo Sultan, sovereign of the Dekkan, with curious presents and gifts of immense value; among which were three elephants, strong as the heavens. These envoys also partook of the disinterested bounty and munificence of the king : but as at this time the account of Tippoo Sultan's death, and of his kingdom being transferred to the English domi nion, reached the acute hearing of the Ministers, the envoys returned to their respective countries. The pen of description shall shortly detail, in its proper place, the affairs of the kingdom of Ingreez, called also Ingilterrah (i. e. England); with an ac count of the arrival of Captain John Malcolm Behadur on the part of the Governor of Hindustan, pursuant to the command of the highly-dignified and puissant King of Ingreez. About the end of this year, Allah Yar Khan, governor of Sabzawar, laying the hand of resigna tion on the mantle of pardon and clemency with which the victorious sovereign is constantly clothed, implored forgiveness for his past offences, and was permitted to enter at the gate of supplication: he therefore despatched a confidential agent to the celestial Durbar, and entreated that one of the royal servants should be appointed to conduct the noble recluse, the beloved nursling of his chaste lady («. e. his daughter), to the female apartments of royalty. Agreeably to his request, Mirza Asad Allah, secretary to the Prime-minister, was selected for this office.DYNASTY OF THE KAJAHS. 103 CHAP. XXII. AN ACCOUNT OF THE SOVEREIGNTY OF FARS BEING CONFIDED TO PRINCE HUSAIN ALY MIRZA, AND THE REGION OF IMAZENDER*N TO PRINCE MUHAMMED KULY MIRZA. The exalted energy and sublime conception ol the sovereign, equitable as Feridoon, decided that young lions from the forest of dominion, and moons of the sphere of splendor and authority, who had been nourished in the shade of the phoenix-like pavilion, and on whom the rays of royal instruction had been reflected, should be constituted Rulers in separate realms, and be invested with power over different countries. Agreeably to this decision, the government of the kingdom of Fars was committed to the energy of the Prince Husain Aly Mirza, of solar-like aspect; and the supreme authority over the paradise-like region of Mazenderan was con ferred on the Jamshid-resembling Muhammed Kuly Mirza. The confidential counsellor, Cheragh Aly Khan Naw'ai, was raised to the office of Atabek to the Prince Husain Aly and the Vizirship of Farsis- tan, and Mirza Nasr Allah was distinguished by being appointed Vizir of Mazenderan; the train of each prince being composed of several noble Kajars, highly trustworthy and loyal, who were to be admitted to deliberation, on such affairs of State and emergency as might occur. Then the Almighty raised the splendor of the world, by putting it into the king's mind to move the sublime royal standard from Te heran, the capital, towards Koom (the orthodox), for the purpose of visiting the pure tomb in whichmmmmummmmmmm mmmttuMMMM* I 104 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. reposes the jewel of the casket of prophecy and di vine mission, Fatima, the daughter of Musa, son of Jaafer (on all of whom be the blessing of God!) The sovereign, on his arrival at that place, the foun dations of which are established in divine mercy, duly performed the conditions of pilgrimage and suppli cation, and the duties of submission and humility. He besought the saints reposing there to bestow their divine influence and assistance on his enter prises, and to employ their intercession for his pro sperity. During several successive nights he was em ployed, inside that hallowed edifice, in reading the Koran and observing the stated times of prayer, as well as interceding for the glory of both habitations and the resurrection of both worlds. From his chari ties bestowed in silver and gold, the laps of the indi gent and helpless became the envy of the mine: he also imparted joy and gladness to the learned and the Seids, whose appointments were multiplied by new grants, and by his unlimited acts of bounty. Besides this, an order was given to skilful architects and ma thematicians, profound as Euclid, to rebuild the edi fices and oratories, which in the course of months and years had fallen into a state of destruction and ruin: and a command, powerful as that of Destiny, was also issued, to build a new College, called Faiziyeh (i. e. Proceeding from bounty), and also to gild the dome of the august Masumah, and to repair the Mosque of Imaum Hasan Askary (on whom be peace !). He also directed to be rebuilt the hospital and caravanserai dedicated to the Sacred Thres hold ; as well as the baths and bazaar for the resi-DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 10J dent pilgrims of the Threshold (the resting-place of angels): in short, it is impossible for the page of description to give a detailed account of those edifices which were built in consequence of the king's visit, and which now soar to the skies. After the victorious sovereign had performed all the duties of pilgrimage, he returned from Koom (the abode of orthodoxy), to his capital, Teheran; and the light of the Garden of Splendor, the mine- bestowing, ocean-giving, Prince Abbas Mirza, the successor to spiritual and temporal power, returned victorious and triumphant from his auspicious jour ney into Azarbai'jan, and obtained the honour of a joyful interview with the king. CHAP. XX11I. AJJ ACCOUNT OF THE EVENTS OF THE FORTUNATE YEAR 1215 OF THE HEJIRA, A. D. 1800. THE DEPARTURE OF THE AUSPICIOUS RETINUE TO KHORASAN, AND THE DETAIL OF THE AFFAIRS OF THAT REGION. The new year hoisted its flag of joy on the plain; The snow-clad troops of the winter began their retreat; The mountains put off their ermine caps, And the bright troops of the sun mustered on their tops.' A gain the rose-bed of Fortune, through the happy influence of advancing spring, attained the splendor of Joseph; and the aged world once more assumed the beauty of Zuleikha. The breath of the life- bestowing breezes of spring brought forth, on the vngin branches of the rose-tree, flowers beautiful as the cheeks of the Messiah; and the imperial rose of sovereignty, with the dignity of Suleiman, sat on the emerald-coloured throne of the rose-bush. TheDYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. friend-protecting, enemy-consuming sovereign, (may he ever be attended with auspicious fortune!) on terminating the festival of the new year, proposed, at the banquet of council, the measure of unfurling his waving banners in the direction of Khorasan the Blessed. In the mean time, Turrah Baz Khan Afghan, by order of Zemaun Shah, came, on the part of Wafadar Khan, the Grand-vizir, to Hajy Ibrahim Khan, the Prime-minister; and the following is the substance of his message, and the pith of his crude proposition:—that Zemaun Shah, obedient to ' friendship, would not put his foot in the stirrup ' of war; nor should the victorious sovereign put ' his docile, high-bred steed in motion in the route ' of Khorasan.' This request covered the sove reign's enlightened soul with the dust of indignation, and his auspicious countenance was averted from the acceptance of such a petition. The determina tion, therefore, of proceeding to Khorasan was defi nitively arranged. According to the tenor of pre ceding statements, every increase of kindness to wards the treacherous Sadik Khan tended only to augment his treason; every day his treachery be came more apparent, so that he placed himself in the attitude of one lying in ambush and sporting with his own blood; and, among other things, he led astray Mumash Khan Kurd. A resolution there fore for his apprehension and punishment, which the exigencies of the times required should no longer be deferred, was announced by the mighty sovereign ; and a few days before the march of the army, a firman was issued for his arrest and im-DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 107 prisonment. Stretched on the bed of sickness and disgrace, his eyes, which were those of tnmnlt and faction, were closed from the vision of this world, which he thus bade adieu. His brother, Sam Khan, was appointed to the eldership (or command) of the Shakaki tribe. Turrah Baz Khan, being per mitted to depart, received this answer to his pro posal :—' The clasp of the pearly string of the neck- ' lace of dominion is fastened only by the sharp ' point of the poniard; and the diamond collar of u universal sway can only be loosened by the fingers ' of spears and swords. Our auspicious sovereign ' claims his hereditary realms, nor will he desist ' from subjugating Khorasan. If others put forth ' pretensions to that kingdom, the decision must ' come by the eloquence of the sword; and in the mean time, the correspondence must be con- ' ducted through the medium of arrows and spears.' CHAP. XXIV. A SUMMARY ACCOUNT OF THE KINGDOMS OF INGILTERRAH, CALLED INGREEZ ; AND THE APPOINTMENT OF CAPTAIN JOHN MALCOLM TO THE EMBASSY OF IRAN, BY MARQUIS LORD WELLESLEY, GO VERNOR OF HINDUSTAN, AGREEABLY TO THE COMMAND OF THE KING OF INGREEZ : AND VARIOUS OTHER MATTERS. The kingdom of Ingilterrah (i.e. England) is com posed of two great islands, and divided into three kingdoms: its length is 380 English miles, and its greatest breadth 300 : it is completely surrounded by the sea. This country contains excellent pastur age and beautiful meadows: fine wool is also pro-108 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. duced there. The water is abundant, and the mines are of various kinds. The inhabitants are robust; the horses delicately formed, and swift; game is very plentiful; and the quantity of wood and coals is im mense. The people are opulent: it possesses excel lent emporia for commerce, where the most costly stuffs and merchandize are met with, and become the objects of purchase and sale. They make, in great quantities, all sorts of watches, military arms, en gines, penknives, silk and woollen cloths, of an ex cellent and beautiful workmanship. The English are high-minded and magnanimous; skilful, saga cious, and intelligent; and their noblemen, honoured and esteemed, are possessed of good faith and sin cerity. Their power at sea exceeds that of all Europe. The capital of Ingilterrah is named Lon don ; a city of great extent, and delightfully built: that part which is called the City contains solid edifices, great inns (of court), academies, highly- ornamented churches, and beautiful school-houses. The royal palace of Ingilterrah is called Parlamentu, which is the place of assembly for the counsellors of the realm. The river Tameez flows through the midst of the city: there are three bridges con structed over it. The kingdom is divided into 52 lylets, or counties. In short, when'the sove reignty of this kingdom came to a lion-subduing woman, Lizabet (i. e. Elizabeth) by name, the peo ple of Ingilterrah, during her days, greatly increased in power. This woman, who was exceedingly i 11- telligent, politic, and subject-protecting, fought atDYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 109 sea against Filip Shah,* king of Aspaniol(/.e. Spain); and though this Filip collected many ships, im mense stores, and experienced soldiers, he suffered a great defeat, and the nation of Ingilterrah attained great power and might on the face of the ocean. In her days, the Compania, which is the title of those who superintend the affairs of Hindustan, was ap pointed f * * * » *; and the commencement of their power in Hindustan was as follows. The people of France, as well as of Ingilterrah, had taken possession of some forts and towns on the eastern shores of the Peninsula of India, and also obtained the supreme power in some islands adjacent to each other's possessions ; and exercised, in those places, by their respective strength, uncontrolled authority and dominion. At a subsequent period, when dis order and confusion arose in the French Government, several battles were fought between the French and English nations; and the latter, being possessed of greater force by sea in the regions and places under their jurisdiction, they expelled the French from the forts and towns along the coast of India, seized their various territories, and remained sole and ab solute masters in those countries. By degrees, they extended their dominion and authority ; and, partly by war, and partly by treaty, imposed tribute on the Sovereigns and Rulers of the countries situated along the coasts of India ; whilst other Indian Princes, in fluenced by their own interests, formed alliances with tbem, so that their power and dignity reached the highest elevation.

The English people fought against him several times : at last, in the year of the Messiah 1802, Tippoo Shah was slain, and all the realms which had been under his government fell into the hands of the English troops, so that they obtained an increase of power and dignity beyond all limits. At the present date, the provinces belong ing to the English in Hindustan are more numerous and extensive than the countries they possess in Aroopa (i.e. Europe), and the island of Irelandah (*Ireland), which was under their sway before these events : therefore we may truly say they have added kingdoms to their kingdom. Their Indian possessions are divided into three Governments : the first, that of Calcutta or Bengal, extends along the course of the river Ganges ; the second, that of Madras, along the Coromandel coast; the last is that of Bombay. The English State has not introduced any innovations into India, but remains occupied in the administra tion and regulation of affairs: the maintenance ot all descriptions of troops, and the expenses of naval armaments for India, belong to the Compania, which is settled in Ingilterrah. The Compania has entered into partnership, alliance, and friendship with the nation -j- » » * * under their own responsi- * I am afraid I must admit the Persians to be not far advanced in geographical knowledge. t The Manuscript is illegible in this part, from the cause al ready explained.unifffi yr DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. Ill bility. r ilie supreme direction of affairs, the move ment of the troops, the internal regulation, admini stration, and arrangements, all depend on the king : the disbursements, changes, and all other matters connected with the country, rest with the Compania, who also, in an eminent degree, derive great profits and advantages from the commerce of Hindustan. In short, after the death ofLizabet, James the First became king. At present, Jarge the Third possesses the sovereign power : he has reigned fifty years over this kingdom, and proceeded in the paths of equity and justice. From ancient times, until the present period, the bond of union and friendship has firmly subsisted between the States of Iran and Ingreez, and there has always been an uninterrupted succession of envoys and ambassadors. This year, therefore. Marquis Lord Wellesley, who had been lately appointed to the splendid rank of Vizir and the office of Governor-general, selected, by order of the king of Ingreez, as Envoy to Iran, Captain Jan Malcolm Behadur. Marquis Wellesley's origin is from the kingdom Irelandah : he is one of the nobles of that country, and of ancient lineage. In the first instance, he was one of the counsellors of the English realm : on account of his skill in affairs, his integrity, innate talents, bravery, and unbounded liberality (which exceeds all description), sagacity, a nd penetration, he was nominated to the Govern ment of Hindustan; on which kingdom he conferred the greatest lustre, by his intelligence, experience, undaunted bravery, generosity, and energy : he pos sessed consummate policy and dauntless intrepidity, so high a degree, that although, on his appoint-112 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. ment to the Vizirship, there existed an obstinate war between the empires of Ingreez, Roos {i .e. Russia), andFransah (France), and the States allied with these Powers, yet, through divine grace, joined to his emi nent loyalty and sagacious foresight, not the smallest symptom of weakness appeared throughout the em pire of Ingreez. Captain Jan Malcolm Behadur, on account of his innate abilities, experience, brave ry, liberality, and prudence, was admitted to the intimate confidence of Marquis Lord Wellesley; and was at first sent by him, along with his brother Lord Wellington, to the Dekkan and Nagpore, where he fought and obtained the victory. He was after wards detached, with Lake Behadur, into Hindu stan, where he fought a severe battle with general Perron, originally a native of Fransah, but engaged in the service of the Marhattas. He defeated Ge neral Perron ; and set at liberty one of the kings of Hindustan, a lineal descendant from Timur Our Khan, who was a prisoner in the hands of the Ma rhattas. This action greatly increased the name and celebrity of Captain Malcolm, who was afterwards appointed Envoy to Iran. When he arrived at the port of Bushir, his sub lime majesty appointed Faty Aly Khan Nury, lieutenant of the royal guards, a prudent and sen sible man, to be his Mehmandar; and commanded, that the duties of hospitality and reverence, in every region through which the envoy passed, being care fully performed, he should conduct him to Teheran the capital. On a day more fortunate than the morning of the new year, the region-subduing mon arch, like the world-illuminating sun, ascended hisnm 1T rnn.rn,i,|| MB | DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 113 heaven-resembling throne, and appeared to the be holders as the fourth heaven enthroned on the eighth sphere : from the rays of his Lunar Crown* (a diamond), the moon hid her celestial crown : from the brilliancy of his Ocean of Light (another diamond), the sun's ocean of light no longer retain ed the power of raising its waves. The Franc en voy, a personage endowed with intellect and frank ness, of profound knowledge, versed in the most subtle intricacies and conversant with the most abs truse sciences, pleasing in speech, skilled in many languages, and experienced in the science of elo quence, being accompanied by three or four emi nent men of the country, obtained the honour of an audience, came to the foot of the sublime throne, and quaffed the delicious wine of desire from the muni ficent cup of the mighty sovereign. After some days, he exhibited, in the vestibule of royal inspection, by way of presents, several objects in steel, mirrors brighter than those of the senses, fans of sandal wood and ebony, birds of melodious notes, costly- flowered and plain silks, from Frangistan and India; a11 which obtained the honour of the sovereign's a Pprobation. In conformity to the commands of the unequalled sovereign, the Ministers of State and the pnncipal officers of the court, regarding the arrival 0 f this distinguished envoy as the abundant source Pers Der One of the large diamonds in the possession of the Kin^ of is called Taje-mah (Crown of the Moon) ; another, the e ya-uoor (the Sea of Light).

In truth. Captain Malcolm was endowed with every accomplishment, theoretical as well as practical. In his embassy to Iran, there occurred not, on his part, the slightest omission or act which could raise a scruple in the mind of the most clear-sighted observers. His imperial majesty regarded him with the eye of esteem, and he received a high station in the exalted service ; for his conduct and manners became every way acceptable to the victorious sovereign's mind. He possessed a hand as bountiful as the vernal showers, and inscribed the character of pure morals on the page of Fortune. In short, when the duties of diplomacy had been performed, a treaty was framed, which, conformably to the wishes of the Governor of Hindustan, was founded on the basis of concord, and contained stipulations of esteem resembling the correspondence of friends; which being submitted to the perusal of the king's Ministers, a compact thereupon, stipulating similar obligations, and containing the like conventions on the part of the sovereign whose hosts are numerous as the stars, was transcribed by the pen of writers skilled in tracing characters resembling those of Mercury. This being sealed with the signet oi Suleiman Khan, was delivered into the envoy's hands; the substance of it was as follows:—' The ' two high States being regarded as one, are to ob- ' serve friendship with their mutual friends, and■ f f *# W • MM HI DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 1 15 ' enmity towards their mutual enemies: if any ' other Power should assume a hostile position to- ' wards either of these two States, the other is then '4:o commence hostile measures against the foreign ' aggressor, and to exhibit friendship and assistance ' to the State so attached*.' When all the rules of diplomacy had been thus complied with, the highly talented and comprehensive-minded envoy and his suite received, in proportion to their rank, both distinction and wealth, by splendid dresses and valuable gifts. Hajy Khalil Khan, chief of the merchants, was appointed, on the part of his ma jesty, ambassador to Hindustan, in charge of his majesty's answer to the Supreme Governor of that country. He shortly afterwards set out, to fulfil his mission, in company with the envoy, who was returning to India.

Abbas Mirza, with a world-consuming, ever-victorious army, along with Suleiman Khan, Ibrahim Khan, and Raza Kuly Khan Kajar, to ar range the affairs of Mazenderan. In the course ol this expedition, the affairs of Nakhshiwan, and some urgent matters relative to Azarba'ijan, were also regulated ; the affairs of Erivan also were put into some order. On Monday the 2d of Zy -hajjah-ul- Haram, the king detached his nephew, Ibrahim Khan, towards Khorasan, with ten thousand annom- clad, dagger-brandishing cavalry, in advance of tin main body: Mahdy Kuly Khan Davalu, and Hu-DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 117 sain Khan, Kullar Akazy, hastened to join his train : an order was also given to Ameer Guneh Khan Za- afferan Lu, governor of Kabushan, and to Ibrahim Khan Shad Lu, governor of Asfarayn, that with their intrepid forces they should also join the fortu nate Nawab's camp, and lay siege to Ak Kelah; and, until the arrival of the victorious retinue, should display unbounded exertion in the reduction of this fort; so that from the thunder of the wall-battering cannon the din of the Last Judgment should strike the hearing of the besieged. On the 11th of Zy- hajjah-ul-Haram, the pavilion of his majesty cast its shadow on the heart-delighting plain of Firoz-koh: and during five days, the encampment of splendor and power was pitched in the groves of Namakah, the terrestrial paradise, for the purpose of reviewing the musketeers of Mazenderan and Asterabad: horn thence, orders were given to Husain Kuly Khan to besiege Sabzawar. The inhabitants of ^ c ngi Kalah, one of the new works erected by Al- l'ih \ ar Khan, which in strength and solidity rivalled the castles of Khaibar and the barrier of Iskcinder, putting their confidence in the strength of the place, presumptuously withdrew from their allegiance and submission to his majesty: orders were therefore t^en to the leopard-like host to reduce the fort, tln d the flame-scattering musketeers completely ■ 111 rounded the fortress. From the terror of the cannon's lurid fire, from the mortar bellowing like t le trumpet of the Resurrection, and from the light- '^-pouring muskets, the bright day became black118 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. and gloomy in the sight of the people of the fort. After a short delay, the garrison of the fort of oppo sition, being without resources on every side, had recourse to the entrenchment of surrender. Thus was this strong fortress reduced; the obedient and the rebellious were treated, according to their respective deserts, with mercy or chastisement, with mildness or severity; and their collected wealth became the booty of the soldiers. Aga Khan Kajar, with a suitable force, was appointed to remain for the defence of the captured works, and the victorious army moved in the direction of Sabzawar. On their arrival in this district, Husain Kuly Khan, who had pushed on the siege of the place with great activity, was ordered to reduce Nishaboor. Allah Yar Khan, beholding the image of death represented in the mirror of his soul, now sent, in a litter, to the royal apartments, his daughter, the beloved object of desire, whom Mirza Asad Allah, secretary to the Prime-minister, had been sent to conduct to court, but whom Allah Yar Khan had until this day concealed under the veil of procrastination. He also penned, in characters as black as his own soul, humble peti tions, apologizing for his offences, and containing this request:—' As the number of the years of my ' life has passed sixty, and the spring of my youth has ' become the sport of the autumn of weakness, the ' hand of the rebellious requires to be propped by a ' staff; for his feet are immersed in the clay of stum- ' bling and sin. The vestibule of the celestial courtDYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 119 ' requires the service of vigorous youths and ac- ' tive administrators: if therefore his majesty, from habitual mercy, should excuse the presence of ' this humble dependant, he will, by the royal per- ' mission, pass in obedience and retirement the few ' hours of life that remain, which would be in ac- ' cordance with the generosity of innate liberality ' and the dictates of a merciful heart. ' He that has no intercessor must trust to the liberality of Ids opponent.' As the form of this deceitful Letter evidently indi cated fraud and deception, so it proved by no means acceptable to the noble sovereign's mind: troops were therefore ordered to take post in the vicinity of Sabzawar, and to lay waste the villages of that district. The victorious army was also commanded to form the siege of that place. As Allah Yar Khan an d Jaafer Khan Byat, before the arrival of the royal train in that district, had despatched trust worthy messengers to Prince Zemaun the Afghan, to i m plore his intercession at the victorious court of the monarch of the age, they turned their anxious ^ooks to the appearance of their mediator, and per severed in maintaining the fort, until the state of the besieged in Sabzawar and Nishaboor became desperate, and the foot of endurance and patience ^ as in danger of being dashed to pieces against stones of anxiety. Turrah Baz Khan came a second time, by the desire of Shah Zemaun, on the ' lart () * ^ afa Dar Khan, with suitable presents and120 DYNASTY OF THE KAfARS. gifts to the Durbar, the resort of the world; and in the dust of Sabzawar, he, like the fading Sabzah {i. e. grass), laid his head at the foot of the sovereign's rose-coloured throne; and having removed the curl ing tresses from the face of the beauty of mystery, in a supplicating manner he thus represented:— ' Although the kingdom of Khorasan is thine, the ' usurped power of it is in hands of others: thou art the Moses of the realm : a wolf is the shepherd ' of the flock: alas, that Ahriman should be the ' guardian of celestial wealth ! Truly, a handful of ' low people and a few mean persons, who, alarmed ' by an evil conscience and the punishment due to ' treason, have hid themselves behind the walls of u Khorasan—are these fit objects for the severity ' of the king, powerful as heaven ? they possess ^ neither strength nor force before the overwhelm- ing waves of the royal hosts. If, therefore, my ' lord, who is prone to mercy, should accept the ' intercession of his devoted servant, and with a ' pardoning hand remove the knot of anguish from ' the condition of these afflicted persons, then this ' well-wisher, when the sovereign's victorious reins are turned towards his capital, having his heart ' tranquillized by the royal bounty, and being de- ' livered from every apprehension of alarm, willpr 0 - ' ceed to the protecting court: and if he should fail ' in this, victory still accompanies the royal banner, ' and the power of the region-conquering army lS ' unimpaired.' Whereas the proposition of opening the gate of friendship and treaty commenced onDYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 121 the part of Prince Zemaun, and the rejection of his request, and the shutting the door of acceptance in the face of his hopes, would have been contrary to the rules of sound policy and altogether opposed to the dictates of hannony, therefore the sin-pardon ing sovereign gave orders to his victorious troops to retire from the siege of Nishaboor : at the same time, Prince Mahmud, who was in attendance on the royal train, and was eager to attain the object of his desire, was allowed to depart. Firmans, in conformity with former precedents, were issued to the governors of Khorasan, ' to assist him in his ' projects upon that kingdom ; that they should ' display their utmost zeal, and not allow them- ' selves to be remiss on these points.' The sun- like banner turning the face of power from Sabza- war, now shed its beams on the capital: Husain Kuly Khan at Asfarayn, and Ibrahim Khan at Ak folah, obtained the honour of kissing the royal car pet. Ameer Guneh Khan Zaafferan Lu, and Ibrahim Khan Shad Lu, departed from the royal Durbar, and hastened to the districts in which they had '^ed their residence. Aga Khan Lar, who was in ^engi Kalah, returned, pursuant to the royal order, tu join the camp; and Ibrahim Khan Arab of Bastam, with the Arab and Ajam musketeers, was commanded to succeed him. His majesty, follow ing the route of Chesmeh Aly, indulged himself in the pursuit of the chace, and from the lustre of his crescent-like diadem rendered the district of Samanan more lucid than the expanse of the ninth122 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. heaven. This heart-attracting abode, from spread ing the carpets of festivity on occasion of the joyful marriage of Prince Muhammed Waly Mirza, became the envy of the painted palaces of China: and from the sound of vocal and instrumental music, and the harmonious lays of the harp and lute, one might have supposed that every house in this region was the scene of a celestial banquet; whilst the secretary, with his golden pen, inscribed in the register of the Government the contract of those two gems of high destiny. W hen the days of rejoicing were ended, the standard of departure was put in motion; and on the 14th of Rabi-ul-akhir, the splendor of spring rested on Teheran the capital, by the arrival of the Jamshid-resembling monarch. During several days, the king interrogated separately the Ummals* and magistrates of Irak and Fars, who had been summoned to court, to ascertain the state ot the cultivators; and with perfect equity he healed the wounds of the broken-hearted. After this, in order to arrange the affairs of Gilan, and to deck the banquet of Prince Muhammed Aly Khan, Kazwin, the seat of authority, became the envy of the Garden of Paradise, by the arrival there of the just and orthodox sovereign. The Ummals of Gilan then presented themselves at the foot of the exalted throne; and by the sovereign's enlightened policy, the affairs of that country were regulated in the manner required.

When the festivities were ended, and the noble-minded sovereign had com pletely arranged all matters, he committed all the concerns of Gilan to Ibrahim Khan, with full powers to regulate them, including even the appointment of Ummals in matters of revenue, and fixed his residence at Resht. After which, the protection-dif fusing banner was again turned towards the capital; and the triumphant Prince Abbas Mirza, heir to the sovereign of the world, who had at this time, agree ably to the royal commands, returned from Azar- ba'ijan, was, through infinite grace, both exalted and rendered happy, by saluting his majesty's threshold.

Besides which, a college was also tommenced. Intelligent architects and skilful121 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. builders removed the ancient dome; and raised to the vault of heaven a new one, more solid. A strong bridge was also constructed over the channel of the river, which flows on the western side oi Koom. They then joined two ancient courts to gether ; and constructed a most delightful college, which, by the aid of mathematical science, was formed like the everlasting Garden of Paradise; containing, within its area, chambers, cisterns, and canals: every apartment resembled the halls of Paradise; the divine light beamed on its very clay and bricks. It contains four colonnades : the western side overlooks the area of the college, and the second the channel of the river, where a par ticular pavilion is expressly built for the residence of the unequalled sovereign; and on the third side of the upper area, which is joined to the Paradise like sanctuary, are many gold-ornamented cham bers ; whilst on the fourth is the great reservoir, so deep, that earth-supporting Piscis comes to its sur face; and the most profound swimmers, before plunging into it, will do well to strike their bead against the knee of astonishment. The lucid dome was so embellished with gold-plated bricks, that the sun fell from the very heart of heaven; whilst at the dawn, the convex sky, with its earliest eye, contemplated their splendor. In truth, since this turquoise dome of heaven has been exalted, and the gold and silver discs of the sun and moon placed in it, a dome of such beauty, and a college on such a model and arrangement, has neverdynasty of the kajars. \2o presented itself to the senses of the most intelli gent spectators. Agreeably to the most exalted firman, the students of divinity, and the professors of the dogmas of truth, who establish the statutes of faith, and by the lamp of whose eloquence the shin- in g lights of the Law are illuminated, were directed to occupy themselves in prayer at every window, like the angels in the balconies of heaven; to employ themselves in every high-place, like the supplicating Cherubims in their spiritual abode ; and to exercise themselves continually among each other, in unra- \ elling the secrets of divine mystery, or in holy dis cussion and conversation. May each morning and evening increase the auspicious fortune of the Sha dow of the Almighty; and may the divine grace ever befriend him! This year, also, an order was issued to Hajy Muhammed Husain Khan, governor of Isfahan, that in the area between the Chihal Sutun and the Ain-e-Behesht, buildings erected by the Sefavi Princes, he should construct a banqueting- house of a most delightful model. In obedience to the orders powerful as those of Fate, by the assist ance of discerning architects, talented artists, and carpenters skilful as Noah, he completed an edifice comprehending in itself colonnades of rare propor tion, palaces without blemish, a delightful orange- Pove, and heaven-like reservoirs, private apart ments, and warm-baths. In like manner, conform- Y to the decrees powerful as those issued by celestials, there being no halting-place for caravans, ( * Every one knows one of the King of Persia's titles is Zil Ullah, Shadow of God.' 11 Hi! hill hur i ii i126 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. during winter, on the banks of the Jojrood, which is the track used by the cafilahs of Mazenderan, the foundation of a strong caravanserai was laid, con taining many rooms, apartments, a warm-bath, and other requisite buildings. This place at present is, to the frozen traveller, a resting-place equal to the igneous sphere. At the village ot Kanariyah Gard also_, on arriving at which, during winter, the skirt of the traveller's heart, journeying from Irak and Fars, was covered with gloom, from the want of a halting and sleeping-place, there was built a caravanserai of stone and brick : this was finally completed by the zeal of active builders, the temporal and eternal rewards of which chanties are i effected on the for tunes of the august sovereign. CHAP. XXVII. A DESCRIPTION OF THE OCCURRENCES OF THE FORTUNATE YEAR, 1216 OF THE HEJIRA : A. D. 1803. ' The spring has again brought forth the perfume of the rose; ' How poor is the power of the perfumer to produce an equa odour! . ' The song of the nightingale resounds through the rose gtimen, ' And even the sluggard can no longer remain on his pillow.

When the season foiDYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 127 the departure of the triumphant standard drew near ; and not the smallest appearance was manifested, on the side of Allah Yar Khan Kalijy and Jaafer Khan Byat, of the fulfilment of their promises, guaran tied, as before stated, by Prince Zemaun ; the eagle like and victorious banner of the region-conquering sovereign soared in his flight much higher than the atmosphere of the destruction of the helpless and indigent; and he ordered the Nuwab Ibrahim Khan, with twenty-thousand spear-brandishing, lightning- scattering infantry and cavalry, to advance to Sabzawar: strict commands were also given to Ibrahim Khan, Muhammed Khan Davalu, and Peer Kuly Khan Sham Biyaty, Ameers of great experience, and to Husain Khan of the royal guards, to Ameer Guneh Khan ZaafFeran Lu, and Ibrahim Khan Shad Lu, two of the governors of Khorasan, that they should not, in this region, draw out from under the lobes ot oppression the hand of plunder and devas tation, nor put forth the foot of injury and ruin; nei ther should they allow themselves to co-operate in the daughter and captivity of individuals, the demolition and destruction of forts and dwellings, nor in con suming with fire the means of life, the harvest of the people. Although Allah Yar Khan individually merited torture and punishment, yet, to the addi tional disgrace of that infatuated man, great multi tudes of the cultivators of Sabzawar were ignomini- ou sly trampled under foot like the herbage, and became associated with anguish and misfortune ;— ' When a field of canes takes fire. Dry and ^reen are consumed alike.'12S DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. CHAP. XXVIII. AN ACCOUNT OF THE DISCOVERY OF HAJY IBRAHIM KHAN S TREASON; AND HIS ARREST AND PUNISHMENT FOR HIS EVIL DEEDS. H ajy I brahim K han S hirazy , in the commence ment of the elevation of the reprobate Zends, had obtained rank and station, partly by the magistracy and office, and partly by being Civil Governor of Shiraz. When the reins of government in Fars fell into the hands of Jaafer Khan, through the bond of sympathy, and similarity of wicked temperament, Ibrahim's glory attained the zenith of grandeur. The life of Jaafer Khan having terminated, the succession to dominion came to his son Lutf Aly Khan: his authority not being yet solidly established, Hajy Ibrahim Khan, in return for the favours of so many years, instigated by vanity, and the ambition of ele vation, formed in his thoughts atrocious projects, and, by promises of silver and gold, associated to himself several chiefs of the Eels, in opposition to Lutf Aly Khan, so that at a favourable opportunity he might tear from him the mantle of supremacy, and extirpate the root of his fortunes with the axe of ingratitude;— ' He who reared the wolf's cub « Suffered for his kindness, when the beast grew up.' At the time the fortunate Sultan, (i. e. Aga hammed Khan) may God shed light on his state elevated the triumphant standard for the conquest o Azarbai'jan, and left the victorious sovereign in I sta ' han, Lutf Aly Khan, heedless of the purpose of destiny, * Literally, May God illuminate his demonstrations!DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 129 came out of Shiraz, with the idle design of possessing Irak. His perfect reliance on the prudence of Hajy Ibrahim caused him to deliver the kingdom of Fars and the keys of the fortress of Shiraz into his hand. The victorious sovereign moved from Isfa han ; and raised the Gavyany banner at Khomsha. The affair had not come to a pitched battle or engagement; when Abdurrahim Khan and Mu- hammed Aly Khan^ the brothers of Hajy Ibrahim, who in concert with him had the intention of throw ing Lutt Aly Khan's state into confusion at the station of Simaram, about the first watch of the night, laid the foundation of tumult, so that, by the adverse winds raised by their uproar, the ship of Lutf Aly Khan's army was exposed to the storms of the whirlpool of destruction ; whilst the brothers of Hajy Ibrahim Khan, now the pilots of the vessel, rescuing their cargoes from the abyss, took the road to Shiraz, and joined their treacherous brother. Lutf Aly Khan being thus overwhelmed in the sea of calamity, Hajy Ibrahim became su preme in the kingdom of Fars, held in his posses ion the keys of the Zendish wealth, and seated himself on the throne of sovereignty*. When he beheld all persons, either from force or inclination, assemble around him, he collected the cushions of temporary prosperity: but at last, he reluctantly P u t his feet under the skirt of obedience to the eceased monarch, and gave up the Fort of Shiraz, * T table W ^ ' HTSent ^hlraz at the time.

Although his base design was clearly seen through, by the late monarch s world-embellishing mind, yet, as in the sight of superficial observers, an important service (but in reality a foul treason) had been acted by him, which the force of reflection ma nifested to have been dictated solely by his own in terest, for which alonehe had destroyed the resources of an enterprising enemy; therefore, in order to arrest the tongue of good and evil, and to secure the hearts of all the Shirazians, and as he had not yet committed any thing which the late monarch coulc lay to his charge as crime, he saw it was necessar} to treat him with indulgence ;* and for the purpose of stopping at once all claims of payment 01 lecom pense, he entrusted to him, in the beginning of his reign, the government of Shiraz; and in this post ^ exercised much cruelty of conduct, to foiward i ambitious views. During a long period he caused the fire of oppression to blaze in Shiraz: with the heated needle he sewed up the eyes of several blameless youths, the remnant of the Zendish race, and entirely consumed the stores of the ancient masters of Fars. When afterwards, at the foot o the imperial throne, he was advanced to the hp dignity of Vizir, he practised inhumanity towarc &gt; * The Spectator says some where, a woman when she writes^ letter always reserves her real intentions and wishes foi * ie ^ script, so the Persian author has kept the real motives w 1L 1 duced Mohammud Khan to give Hajy Ibrahim the appoin m _ of Govenor of Shiraz and the province of Fars, to the en o long sentence.DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 131 the servants of God, and separated the distressed from their wives, children, and relations: in short, he persevered in bringing affliction on mankind; and sowed the seed of thorns, until they grew up and laid hold of his own skirts. He, however, maintained a high place in the government, until the fortunate monarch turned his face from this transitory world to that of eternity, and the celes tial throne was embellished by the splendor of the present unrivalled sovereign; whereas, in the be ginning of his reign, this fortunate prince carefully followed the rules and regulations of the deceased monarch (the denizen of Paradise), yet the people of the world became quite astonished at the increased honours conferred on Hajy Ibrahim Khan during the reign of the world-subduing monarch; as, through the royal munificence, each of his brothers and sons had been raised to the government of a province, and thus their oppressive acts and insult ing words had been exhibited towards all men. His eldest son dashed forward in a career of extor tion in Pars : his younger son spread devastation in the retirement of Kashan : and his other brother passed his time similarly in Bihbehan. When Fortune had brought near the time of retaliation, the com plaints and appeals of the oppressed came to the presidents of the August Gate; and although they produced a revolution in the soul of the high- funded, subject-protecting sovereign, he, through niercy and tenderness, had again recourse to admo nition ; thinking Hajy Ibrahim might perchance ^strain himself in future from such oppressive acts: hut the medicine of counsel was of no avail, and he k 213-2 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. continued to walk in the same perverse path. Matters at last came to this pitch, that, even in the royal presence, renewed complaints were openly and publicly made against his tyranny. At this conjunc ture, threats and menaces of incurring the royal castigation became altogether useless : he neither opened the eye of regard to his own state, nor de sisted from such unseemly deeds ; nay, he even uttered to different persons improper observations, which merited severe punishment: besides this. Ins frauds and embezzlement in the revenue exceeded all bounds. At last, after proving his endless crimes, the blackness of the pupil of his eye was displaced with the knife, and his tongue was re moved with the sharp-edged steel. His gold and silver, and hidden treasures, the sources of his pride and the fruits of his extortion, were all seized; and imperative instructions were issued forth, to inflict the punishment due to their evil deeds, on his sons, brothers, and associates, in every part ol the well- protected country. Thus the oppressed and weak were rescued from the tyranny of this family : some were deprived of sensation by tasting the cup of the scimetar; in others, the lamp of sight became extin guished : whatever heavy afflictions, in the course ot life, they had inflicted on others now befel them selves ; in the space of fourteen days, a splendor and wealth which had never been equalled by the Barmacides were exchanged for such degradation and humiliation, that until the verge of the resm- rection it will form the subject for conversation to great and small. The great capital of wealth which during so many years had been amassed by theDYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 133 talons of violence, and the transport of which would have fatigued hundreds of the strongest camels, became now so scattered, that the most industrious ant could not have shewn even two grains of it collected in any one place. Hajy Ibrahim, his wife, and his sons, deprived of sight, were, pursuant to the royal order, settled in Kazwin, until he de scended to the dark tomb. When the tree of opposition, in the garden of the kingdom, had been felled by the hair-dividing sword of justice and equity, and its fruit and leaves entirely plucked off, the mantle of the Vizirship, as in former times, was adjusted to the stature of the Asuf of majesty, Mirza Muhammed Shafi; and the Prime-minister, Suleiman Khan Kajar, with fifteen thousand cavalry, was, pursuant to the command of the celestial Durbar, appointed, as in former years, to lay waste the area of Jaafer Khan Biyat's tranquillity. ' Truly, all assistance comes from God.' &gt; CHAP. XXIX. AN ACCOUNT OF THE RENEWED INSURRECTION OF HUSAIN KHAN HIS CAPTIVITY AND THE SUPPRESSION OF TUMULT BY THE EQUI TABLE MONARCH. W hen , through the seduction of demon-like men, and the folly and madness of his own heart, (as has l j een before described,) the ambition of sovereign power entered the head of Husain Kuly Khan Kajar, he wished to oppose the designs of destiny, and, ^o/w-like, to contend against the sun of divine niercy, he fell to the ground like a shadow, and bowed his neck in submission. But as the people131 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. were not yet aware of the extent of his folly and crimes, the king, in policy, allowed him to proceed in his wickedness, until his utter unworthiness should become manifest, even to the disaffected, and the world at large be convinced of the extent to which his offences reached. The pure heart of the sove reign of the world, however, had spread open before his fortune the gates of liberality, pardon and indulgence, and raised him to the government of Kashan: there he extended the hand of oppres sion over the poor of that region, and, from his ex travagant modes of conduct, became thoroughly ex posed to all the world. When he had thus con sumed with the fire of injustice the dwellings and abodes of several persons destitute of all resources, and had amassed some funds on which he could rely, again the featherless, wingless, carrion-feeding vulture of his thoughts essayed to move in the tainted atmosphere of putridity, and his ancient frantic and long-entertained plans re-entered his head. He laboured in secret to amass funds; and in public, to draw a curtain over his hidden thoughts by demonstrations of loyalty and allegiance. He at one time pretended to be desirous of retiring from the world, so that people might imagine he had resigned all worldly distinctions and despised the crown and throne; and, in the robes of hy pocrisy, he abstained from animal food, and spread the carpet of worship in mosques opposite to the most holy and sacred spots, to the intent that every one might believe that his heart was altogether sick of pomp and power. He sent daily to the foot of the celestial throne, humble petitions expressive ofDYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 135 attachment to his exalted majesty, and of his de termination to retire from the world : in return, his imperial majesty conferred high honour upon him, by despatching diplomas explanatory of the difficul ties that attend royalty, and replete with useful counsels concerning the avoidance of all sensual temptations; so that, if it were possible, he might perhaps be induced to abandon a state of impru dence, by which means the cauldron of dark designs might cease to boil over. Some time had passed in this manner, when there appeared a person of obscure rank and vicious habits, named Muhammed Kasim, related to the tribe of Biralwand, who was every day imprisoned in some city or other on account of his pretensions to work miracles and compose the philosopher's stone; who in one place called himself Mulla Ba- rany, and in another styled himself Mulla Mu hammed ; and having escaped from prison, he an nounced himself at Kashan as Muhammed Kasim, and under that appellation became acquainted with the prince. Husain Kuly Khan considered this man's arrival as a fortunate omen of his attaining to royal splendor, counted on him as a source of abundance, and, profusely lavishing on him every mark of re spect, admitted him amongst his confidential ad visers. Whilst matters were in this state, a Saiyid, Ml of deceit and hypocrisy, who had a previous intimacy with Muhammed Kasim, having come to Kashan, they both concerted a plan of this kind;— tliat the Saiyid should retire into a hermitage, and Withdraw himself from all intercourse with society; an d that, without forming an intimacy with eitherDYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. friend or stranger, he should announce himself as wholly devoted to the One True God;—that he should sometimes prophesy about hidden things, and sometimes pretend to explain the secrets of the Mystery*; until the people of Kashan, reckoning him amongst the Aktah and Austad of the age, should exhibit a strong desire of having interviews with him; so that this intelligence coming to the ears of Husain Kuly Khan, he might send for him also. In short, the Saiyid was concealed from every eye, and the desire of beholding him prevailed in every heart: his miraculous works circulated on the tongues and lips of all men. Some confidential agents, through the suggestions of Muhammed Kasim, ex plained to Husain Kuly Khan the extent of his knowledge; and he, from internal depravity, be came strongly inclined to an interview with him, in order to ask his assistance. From the Saiyid's art ful denial, the flame of desire in the heart oi Ilusain Kuly Khan blazed with greater intensity; and at last, after much importunity, the favour was granted, and he passed a whole night in confidential commu nication with the impostor. The deceitful Saiyid, full of cunning and deceit, caused strange visions to play before his sight, and words like these to assail his ears:—' I am the Naib of the Lord of the agef, ' and have turned away my thoughts from all re- ' gard to worldly concerns : but in such concerns ' the word of Muhammed Kasim is stamped with * The Mystery, {jpar excellence?) i. e. The Philosopher's Stone, t The Imam Mehde whose re-appearance on earth is expected by all pious Muhammedans.DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 137 ' authority; in opening the gate of prosperity, his ' hand is all-powerful; the ascent to the elevated ' rank of royalty is easily compassed by his aid: as ' long as thou canst, withdraw not thy head from ' the bond of obedience to him. I say no more.' On hearing these words, Husain's heart was no longer in his possession, and patience departed from his soul: his attachment to Muhammed Kasim be came more and more extravagant. Matters at last proceeded to this, that at night he stood before him in a submissive attitude, like an attendant, and laid at his feet the head of weakness and supplication. Husain, now giving up all self-possession and exer tion, became immoveable, like a painting on the wall, and surrendered the reins of his will to this worthless wretch. Husain began by ordering his ancient coun sellors, who dissuaded him against opposing the king, and persevered unanimously in this counsel, to be dragged to prison : some were thrown into despair, being disabled by the lancet of injustice longer to behold the bright visions of the world : others were confined in secret dungeons. The intent of his 'ebellion was now discovered. In the middle of Rabi-al-awwal, he deceitfully contrived to persuade the victorious prince, Muhammed Tuky Khan, to leav e the city before him; and at midnight he re moved all his baggage and effects from Kashan to halanz. Having there assembled a number of soldiers, some volunteers, and others by the arm of impulsion, he directed his march to Isfahan : he entered that city by surprise, and proclaimed, as if 111 pursuance of an imperial firman—' Hajy Muham- Bied Husain Khan is dismissed from the govern-•rttf 138 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. ment of Isfahan, and Prince Muhammed Tuky Khan is lord and governor in his place.' High and low in Isfahan looked upon the burden of this deceitful song to be true, therefore Hajy Muhammed Husain Khan, the governor, retired, and left in their possession the royal throne; which the goldsmiths and artificers were employed in making lor the king; and flying in great haste, carried with him all the effects he possessed. The falsehood of this in telligence soon became manifest to the people, when the opportunity of resistance was lost. All the chiefs of Isfahan, being destitute of resources, left the city; and Husain Kuly Khan, having taken up his residence in the garden of Saadat-abad, stretched forth his hand to seize the wealth of the merchants, and to inflict fines and tortures on the rich men of the country. He also coined gold and silver in his own name. The vile and profligate wretches of Isfahan, equally devoid of reputation and disci pline, having assembled around Muhammed Kasim, became possessed of capital, rank, and opulence. When this intelligence was conveyed to the exalted sovereign, magnificent as Feridoon, fir mans, irresistible as those of fate, were despatched to the different regions and districts, and com manded to be considered as the fiat of Destiny ' Let the governors and chiefs of the army in every ' place block up the high roads and communica- 'tions; and having posted themselves in e\eiy ' narrow pass, let them not permit the rebel to ' proceed a single step: let them also pay no re- ' gard to his high relation of a brother to us; h 11 ^ ' let them bring Husain Kuly in manacles to theI)Y T NASTY OF THE KAJARS. 139 'fortunate stirrup.' Jan Muhammed Khan and Husain Kuly Khan Davaly were ordered with a considerable force to Koom and Kashan, to collect the troops distinguished by victory, and to await there the arrival of the auspicious retinue. In the course of these affairs, the Nawab Ibrahim Khan, and Suleiman Khan, arrived from Khorasan: Abbas Mirza also, brother to Nadir Mirza, came, by his brother's desire, with representations of humility and acknowledgment of error, requesting pardon and forgiveness for his past crimes ; and clearly de tailing, that Husain Kuly Khan, from simplicity of his mind, was led into rebellion, and to seat himself on the carpet of authority at Isfahan, by the insidi ous counsel of Muhammed Kasim. These steps being taken, and these tidings being made known, the high-minded sovereign saw no occasion for further reflection or uneasiness; and therefore an order, powerful as that of Destiny, was issued to the Heir of the sovereignty. Prince Abbas Mirza, and to the Prime-minister, the Vizir, Muhammed Shafi, who was in attendance on his highness, to reside in Ae capital, and to use the most cautious prudence in administering the affairs of Teheran and Mazen- deran; submitting a daily report of all events to the world-enlightening prudence of the sovereign. Al- though the countless hosts from the adjacent and remote regions had not as yet entirely assembled under the shadow of the wide-spreading banner, } e t, as the present train of the victorious stirrup ap peared quite sufficient to crush the revolt of wicked- 1K 'ss and agitation, in the beginning of Rabia-ul- the eagle standard, resplendent as the sun.140 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. with firm purpose winged its way from Teheran; and, in its progress, an overwhelming force, like a raging torrent, poured along in the king's train, to wards Isfahan. On the very appearance of the Pis- ciform flag, shining like the sun, the Soha of Husain Kuly Khan's existence was deprived of light and splendor; he therefore left his baggage, stores, and heavy equipages, in the fort of Isfahanak, and en trusted the care of the magazines of corn and grain laid up there to some trusty dependants; with strict injunctions, that, until they heard from him, they should exert themselves to maintain the for tress, and not open the gates to any one. Having appointed Hajy Jaafer of Isfahan, brother to Bakir Khan Khorassany, his deputy over the city, he turned his face to the desert of destitution and the dreary solitude of a wandering life. The instant the victorious royal banner spread its shadow in the vicinity of Isfahan, all Husain Kuly Khan's people fled; and Hajy Jaafer, in the greatest trepidation, betook himself to the fort. The short space of one week had elapsed, when his majesty commanded the Nuwab Ibrahim Khan, with a considerable body of troops, to take the fort, and to arrest Hajy Jaafer; whilst the victorious army, in pursuit of Husain, advanced to the territories of Gulpaijan and Ker- manshah ; so that if the fugitive should attempt to escape from the royal power in the direction of Baghdad, they might prevent him, and bring him prisoner to court. At Gulpaijan it was reported to his world-subduing majesty, that Muhamnied Kasim had conducted Husain Kuly Khan to Silakhur and Barujerd, under the hope of pi' 0 *DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. Ill curing help from the Biralwand and Bajilan tribes : they, however, scarcely listened to him: a few only, through the temptation of Muhammed Kasim, hazarded their lives and joined him : even several of his own body-guards, foreseeing the result of his conduct, hastened to the royal camp. Besides this, Aka Khan Kajar in Silakhur, and Muhammed Aly Khan in Barujerd, had intercepted all the com munications by the different roads and passes, and taken up a position with a body of experienced soldiers, for the purpose of giving him battle : impelled by necessity, he scattered his heavy bag gage, and fled towards Kermanshah and Baghdad. This known, separate express diplomas, confer ring distinction on Aka Khan and Muhammed Aly Khan were despatched to them by couriers ; strictly enjoining them to urge on the pursuit without delay, and not suffer the rebel to reach the territory of Baghdad, nor that of any other Turkish territory. On the day that the army pitched the victorious tents in the Plain of Kamrah, intelligence arrived, that when Muhammed Kasim had witnessed Husain Kuly Khan's ruined state, he, along with his his friends, made preparations for flight; but Hu- sain s confidential attendants, with the hand of ex ertion having removed the curtain that concealed his plans, arrested him in the bonds and chains of punishment: however, after a few days, Muham- ^d Kasim, by his devices and artifices, delivered i • J * ^iself from confinement, and turned his face to the regions of infamy and destitution *. On his de parture, Husain, setting no value on the means still * i. e. Destroyed himself.142 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. left to him, abandoned his remaining resources in one of the villages, and took the road leading to Koom, the seat of orthodoxy ; although he was as yet uncertain whether he should take refuge at the threshold of Masumah (on whom be peace!) or betake himself to some other quarter. The region- subduing sovereign had despatched a consider able force to Koom by way of Mishk-abad and Ferehan, with instructions, that, whenever Husain arrived, he should be allowed, in all security, to take an asylum at the threshold of the pure descendant of the Prophet: to which was added the exalted injunction, that if he attempted to take any other direction they must prevent him. When the royal retinue, like the mountain -billows of the ocean, drew near Mahalat, certain information was there procured. Husain saw that the only remedy left for his condition was to lay his supplicating hands on the mantle of the pure descendant of the Prophet, to whom the Kouw was revealed : he therefore chose his abode in the shade of the dome expanded like the firmament; and he was there permitted to take refuge, agreeably to the commands of the fortunate sovereign. The fol lowing day, the master of the Seven Climes raise the standard of march to Koom (the abode of the Faithful) ; and at the end of Rabia -ul-akhir rendere the environs of Koom like the empyreal dome, the elevation of his tents, the emblems of victoi}^ When, in fulfilling the duties of pilgrimage, he ha bowed his crown-bearing head on the sacred dust, Prince Muhammed Tuky Mirza partook ot happ 1 ^ ness, through kissing the hands of the love -diffusin n sovereign. Husain Kuly Khan also, laying on hisDYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 143 neck the sword of supplication, and placing his hand on the foe-subduing monarch's mantle of pardon, rubbed the forehead of excuse in the dust of submission: from his pardon-imploring eyes, tears of blood streamed down his cheeks on the man tle of the sovereign distinguished for compassion. The milk of fraternal love was excited: with a mer ciful hand he raised his brother's head from the dust, and elevated him to the pinnacle of Heaven. Thus Husain, through his own urgent prayers, joined to the Balkis-like* wishes of the Ark of Glory, and the Mary-like interposition of the essence of chastity, was, by the benevolent sovereign's order, settled at Koom, where he passed his time in visiting the holy places and in acts of devotion. After a few days, the victorious standard again bent its way to wards the capital; and several worthless wretches of theBiralwand tribe, and others, the principal means of carrying on the revolt, who had been made prisoners b y the foe-binding army, were put to death by the mi ghty sovereign's command; some by the ampu tation of limbs ; others became the food of dragon like mortars ; numbers were consumed in the flames the soul-dividing falchion ; and others, on the tops of minarets displayed to the world their ghastly usages : thus they ultimately attained their deserts, ^d the world once more reposed from tumult. 1G n Husain had resided some time at Koom, he P 1 evented the access of the inhabitants to the a cred tomb ; and by his oppression and unseemly Co nduct, the pilgrims to that seat of orthodoxy The Queen-mother Is here intended by the allusions to the 110011 Sheba and the Virgin Mary.144 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. were reduced to the last extremity. Such behaviour caused a firman to be issued, commanding that he should be removed to the capital; where he was de tained some time in the palace of the Nawab Ibra him Khan : at last, pursuant to the sagacious reason and profound plan of the sovereign of the world, he was, in a manner suitable to his conduct, sub jected to reverse and imprisonment within the confinement of bastions and trenches in the district of Shahmiran : there he became hopeless of ever beholding the world* : night and day his table was bounteously furnished at the expense of the royal exchequer, and he gave himself up to worship and devotion, to the meditation of the glorious Koran, to the repetition of the stated offices, and laying up stores meet for the day of the resurrection; thus obtaining the divine favour through suffering and affliction. This is the proper place to mention the return oi Allah Yar Khan and Ibrahim Khan to the celestial Durbar.—All efforts and opposition directed against those exalted by the hand of God are to their subjects the cause of humiliation, and of dragging on them mountains of calamity ; for disobedience to the prohibitions and orders of the shadow of the Al mighty Director is the source of disgrace, and the road to the mansions of despair and abandonmentf- Thus Allah Yar Khan, after such great presumption and such repeated iniquities, which had laid waste * This periphrase means, that he was deprived of sight by ^ royal command.

By chance, as at this time, a body of wandering Turkomans made an irruption to plunder the dis trict of Sabzawar. Kalige Aga, the redoubted war rior, who in the day of need assisted him by the power of his arm, went in pursuit of them ; but during the contest he took the road leading from this transitory world, and thus undermined the bar rier of strength on which Allah Yar Khan relied, so that he could then find no asylum, save that of the royal court, to remedy his dreadful state :— ' From this it is impossible to fly, ' For thou art the only place of refuge.' Although Allah Yar Khan well knew his majesty's universal bounty, still, from the enormity of his cn mes, he presumed not at once to turn his face to ^ le court, the asylum of the world ; but, in order to assure himself of security and repose, he pre viously sent one of his uncle's sons to the threshold of mercy and grace, and with the hand of supplica- jjon grasped the skirts of the intercession of his en efactor.

The benevolence-diffusing sovereign arrayed the object of the prince s desire in the ornament of acceptance ; and the envoy, re plete with hope, hastened back from the royal court. Allah Yar Khan, with his wife, children, re lations, and followers ol the Kalijah tribe, bade adieu to Sabzawar, and arrived at Teheran, the seat of empire. He there rubbed the forehead of ex cuse on the dust of the threshold founded in equity; and the April shower of royal compassion refreshed the verdure on the meadow ol his hopes, by par doning his sins and errors, and by augmenting his rank and dignity:— ' From that door no supplicant departs in despair.' By the ocean-like hand of his majesty's bounty, he was exalted by the investiture of Sabzawar along with the fiefs of Ishtiharad in the district of Kaz- win, in which were the ancient settlements oi the Kalijah tribe. Besides this, whatever advantages and revenue he had forfeited in the course oi his rebellion and ingratitude, they were, through the king's unmixed generosity, now doubled :—- ' Though he may be wrath at thy evil deeds, ' When thou retumest, he blots out thy crimes.'DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 147 CHAP. XXX. a summary account of abdul aziz, the arab shaikh. A bdul A ziz S haikh was the chief of a tribe of bar barous Arabs : the following is a summary account of his history. He was the supreme head of the tribe. Among the chiefs of that nation, there was a man called Abdul Wahhab, who (VikeBu Jahal), at first studied under one of the inhabitants in the vicinity of Bussorah, named Muhammed: he at length came to Isfahan, to prosecute his studies in the university there; and spent almost an age in the colleges of that place, perfecting himself in the different branches of the Law, Religion, and Gram mar; so that he flattered himself he had become acquainted with the subtle doctrines of all religions, though, through the temptations of Iblis, he went astray. His creed is as follows:—The Great Inde pendent Existence is One; and the necessity of the Apostolic Mission, and of the Divine Book, is doubt less and indisputable. After the departure of the last of the Prophets, the Book of God is sufficient ^ or all purposes: but at every period there is a Supreme Doctor (Mujtahid) among the True Be lievers, the solver of all difficulties: at one time, Abu Bekr ; at another, Omar; at another, Othman; then the Lord of True Believers, Haidar; again, Shafia, and Abu Hanifah ; and at another time, the v enerabl€ Imam, Jaafer Aly (on whom be salvation!) ^hen one Mujtahid passes away, another comes in place, and extracts from the Book of God the ex planations of all questions; so that men may l 2148 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. conform their actions agreeably to this explanation: but erecting lofty domes over sepulchres and tombs, bringing gifts and votive offerings, gilding shrines with silver and gold, making pilgrimages to them, kissing the threshold of the venerable family, making cakes of the clay of their tombs, and praying over them, are innovations in the Law, and associating others with God. They who undertake such acts are ranked with infidels; and resemble the multitude whom the Almighty, in the Koran, calls the a Associators;' those, who make idols with their own hands, and, looking upon them as mediators with God, perform to them pilgrimages, service, adoration, and wor ship : otherwise, they acknowledged the unity ol God, and regarded these metals as intercessors and mediators, and not as the self-existing God. Having propounded some obscure doctrines of this kind m the rites of religion, he went from Isfahan, among his own tribe, and expressed himself after the same manner to his Shaikh. Now Abdul Aziz had lon 0 entertained projects of elevation; and it is certain, that whoever conceives the ambition of raising him self, will have his purpose more speedily and easil) accomplished by introducing new dogmas and regu lations: he therefore assented to his words, and, having deviated from the Law, summoned the Arabs to embrace this new faith. In order to propagat 0 his tenets, he entered into hostilities and contests with the Arabs of the desert. Abdul Aziz began to spread his creed by means of the sword, and lie^ a&gt; sometimes defeated, and sometimes victorious; but he acquired wealth and resources, and at last built in Dereyeah a strong fort, strong as a cuirass 0DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 149 iron. He continued to increase his forces and wealth by plunder and spoil; so that most of the Arab tribes of the desert either submitted, or were subjected by force ; and the extent of his authority reached to that degree, that his sons advanced to the confines of Meshed Ally. Saud, the eldest son of this polluted wretch, attained high reputation for bravery and magnanimity ; so that, between his policy and art, and the force of his lance and sword, great numbers of the Arabs of the desert became his subjects, and acknowledged his authority. As he entertained the delusive idea of destroying the thresholds and temples of the Holy Imams (upon whom be peace!), all which, according to his faith, he regarded as places of abomination; and as he also proposed to slay the pilgrims and inhabitants of those places, whom he looked upon as idolaters and associators, when the time for attacking the most Holy Najf arrived, he imagined himself able, by the strength of his arm, to extinguish the light of the Almighty; but, through the might of the hand of God (Ally), and the advance of the Arab ^hias, the Ghazael Arabs, and those of other places, joined to the strength of the fortifications, the arrow of his purpose impinged against a stone. Whereas, h'om the time of Nadir Shah's sovereignty, until the rei gn of the present king of kings (when, by the mercy of God, the people of Iran repose in perfect tranquillity, and every one who had formerly pre ferred emigration now turns his face to his native country), nearly sixty years had elapsed; during which period the nobles and opulent men from all *he regions of Iran and Hindustan, through the150 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. uniform unsettled state of those kingdoms, bid adieu to their native country, retired to the thresholds of the pure Imams, in order that their persons and property, under the blessing of their hallowed vici nity, might be secure from attacks of every kind, and might remain protected against the rapacity ot all oppressors ; in consequence of this, the number of strangers who came to visit the holy site of Najf, Kazmin, and Kerbela, was so great, that there was no longer room for the real inhabitants of those sacred places : for many of these strangers became permanent residents; and others so much prolonged their stay, that these holy habitations, abounding in divine grace, ultimately afforded no place to which the hermit could retreat for contemplation, nor the pious person for the offices of devotion. One would have imagined none would have consi dered these sacred regions as fit places to resort to for the acquisition of unlawful wealth, or as spots in which unprincipled pleasures might be indulged and sensual appetites gratified : but so it was, that the inhabitants became so devoted to usury and to the innovation of detestable heresies, to shameful acts and disgraceful deeds, that if any person in any city of True Believers had attempted to practise them, they would not merely have incurred censure, but have exposed themselves to torture and punishment. By degrees, in all the towns the shrines, particularly that of Kerbela, the thoughtlessness of these persons arrived at such a pitch, that things forbidden by the Law were looked upon as lawful; and sinful acts, which even in secret would have been shameful, weie openly committed without any concealment: theydynasty of the kajars. 151 felt no reverence for God, and no respect for the com mands of the Almighty—Him, from whom no secrets are hid, and whose piercing eye penetrates every sin and foul offence. So earnest were they in collect ing riches, that during whole years they did not even externally practise the ziyarat * of the pure threshold; much less did they think of that internal ziyarat, which tells them to abandon forbidden things, to attend the due performance of worship, and to occupy themselves in treasuring up good works. It therefore became necessary for the Al- mighty, and His ministers, with hands upheld by mercy, to purify the holy soil (which rejects all pol lution) from the contamination of impure spirits and the defilement of unlawful wealth, and to remove the veil of negligence from the eyes and hearts of the people, by the edge of the sharp, terror-exciting, sword of the barbarous Saud: and thus to requite them for their wickedness. Prosperity averted her lace, and Saud {i.e. the Fortunate), by the command 0 1 Abdul Aziz, obtained the same power over them that Nebuchadnezzar formerly did over the Children of Israel. The history of this event is as follows:—When the sword of Abdul Aziz became hlunted {i.e. failed) in his attempt on the most holy Najf, in order to retrieve his sullied reputation, ^I'en he turned to the conquest of Kerbela, and meditated the slaughter of those inhabiting the abodes of grief (Kaib) and misfortune {halo), which Were utterly devoid of strong fortifications. By his Election, Saud, having taken with him 12,000 men * Ziyarat —a religious visit to the tombs.152 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. of his avenging armies, in the month Zy-hajjah of the same year, advanced, by way of the Desert, to Kerbela; and on the morning of the day of Khadir, without being perceived, rushed to the walls of the place. On entering, they smote with the edge of the pitiless sword whomsoever they met, both young and old; and, without regard to decency, they stripped the women quite naked. With stones for sledges, and with shameless hands and malevolent fingers, they broke to pieces the pure tomb, and tore asunder, in their madness, the chains of the en lightened casket of the Prince of Martyrs ; bearing away, as plunder, the treasury of the temple, the gold and silver candelabras, the tapestry, and the precious objects of the holy sanctuary. They dashed to pieces the gold-plated tiles of the cupola, and the mirrors in the Paradise-resembling porticoes: they destroyed the doors and walls; and in one moment bore away, in plunder, the gold, diamonds, and valuable effects brought there from every country, and of which each house seemed to be a treasury. Torrents of blood flowed in the streets and bazars: the calamity of the 10th of Muharram, and the catastrophe of Kerbela, were again displayed in this holy land. According to credible accounts, the num ber of slain was nearly 6000 ; but the amount of the plundered wealth is unknown to all, save God. Youths of celestial aspect, from the sight of whose cheeks the sun himself became agitated, on be holding whose curling locks the hyacinth writhed m jealousy, now lay stretched on the dark soil, then roseate cheeks defiled with clotted gore : the Law- expounding, angelic-minded sages, whom the planetSSB5??«5*5»i dynasty of the kajars. 153 Jupiter could not rival in eloquence, nor Mercury in the use of the pen, now concealed, in the veil of dust, their enlightened foreheads, discoloured with blood. When seven or eight hours had passed in slaughter and plunder, having placed loads on loads on their camels, they turned their face to Dereyeah. If, through such an event as this being permitted, a doubt, in consequence of weakness of belief, or a lukewarmness in faith, should arise in ignorant people, from reasoning in this manner—' The in- ' dignation of the saint (on whom be peace !) should ' not have predominated in this instance, nor have ' permitted that so many holy personages devoted ' to his worship should be ignominiously slaugh- ' tered, or the bodies of the pvire in soul welter in ' their blood in that sacred soil; neither should his ' undefiled coffin have been broken, nor the gilded ' bricks torn from the doors and walls'—the original catastrophe of Kerbela, and the mar-' tyrdom of that holy personage in the plain of woe, dispels such doubts, and cuts the thread of wavering and perplexity; as, notwithstanding the sacred presence of the Imam, (obedience to whom is a sacred duty, and all mankind are convinced of the necessity of such obedience,) still his murderers were not withheld by shame, nor by any respect for the last of the Prophets; but broke the covenants ^reed on ; drew out in battle array, and with the sword cut off the heads of chieftains; and so, re gardless of honour and heedless of reputation, they poured on the earth the pure blood of Muhammed's family; and threw the dust of disgrace of this world a 'd the next, not only on their own heads, but on154 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. those of the whole human race. That holy per sonage's mirror-like breast, which was truly a casket of divine mystery, was broken by arrows; the chains around the tomb of his argent face, beaming with a portion of celestial light, were rent asunder by the hands of wanton tyranny. Apparently, therefore, that event is much more deserving of religious doubt than the capture of Kerbela, where they slew, in his vicinity, sinners and criminals ; bore away ill-acquired riches; and broke up a wooden coffin and an iron tomb. Notwithstanding that the attack on the tomb of this holy person was appa rently a crime, yet, in reality, it proved the source of countless good and advantage to his people and himself. In short, on the occurrence of this event, the sovereign possessed of the avenging power ol Mars sent Ismail Beg, a Ghoolam, to Bagdad, and wrote a despatch to this purport to Suleiman Pasha: ' Should the entrance of the Persian ' forces into the Othman territory not administer ' to the chiefs of that high and mighty empire any ' far-fetched suspicions as to their purpose, let it be ' made known to us, that, by the aid of the Al- ' mighty, we may eradicate the corrupt principles of ' these wretched Wahabees. As their power is not ' yet consolidated, so the remedy is easily applied; ' but an affair now easily accomplished will, * ( through negligence, terminate in difficulties. Suleiman Pasha returned this answer : ' In virtue ' of orders emanating from the Othman Govern- *' ment, the means of extirpating the very princi- ' pie of the corruptions of these depraved wretches ' have been collected on every side, and in a shortdynasty of the kajars. 155 ' time a trace of their existence shall not remain ' in the area of fortune : therefore there will be no ' occasion to trouble the troops of Iran in this ' unimportant matter. Measures for the repair of ' the pure Mausoleum, and for replacing those ' articles that have been destroyed, shall, with the ' blessing of the Almighty, instantly be carried ' into effect by this government.' By chance, at this very moment, Suleiman Pasha hastily departed from this transitory world to the eternal; after which the greatest disorder prevailed in the affairs of Bussorah and Bagdad : so that the chiefs of the Othman Government had no opportu nity, from that quarter, of correcting the atrocious conduct of these Arabs, and the fire of their depravity remained unextinguished. CHAP. XXXI. AN ACCOUNT OF THE EVENTS OF THE YEAR OF HAPPY TENDENCY, 1217, OF THE HEJIRAH, A, D. 1S03. A spring 1 so charming bloomed forth, that In the rose-garden ' The hyacinth was without spots, and the rose without thorns; The parterres spread their tulips with leaves like Lila's cheek. And odonferous willows put on the forms and shed the per fume of Majnoon.' The vernal gale, with its glad tidings of folding up the carpet of winter, diffused its breezes over the e xpanse of the garden; and the hand of the April clouds, full of buds and roses, ornamented the ears a nd necks of the shoots and vines. At this period friend-cherishing, enemy-consuming sovereign, like the great luminary on the throne of Aries, or the expanded rose on its emerald-coloured seat, le posed on his Jamshid-like throne : whilst the156 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. Princes,resembling full moons, with the arrangement of the Pleiades, and the highly-dignified Ameers, in the order of the stars, stood around, in front of the celestial assembly : harvests of gold and silver, with munificent hands, were liberally poured over all; and from the wardrobe of the beneficent sove reign, splendid dresses, proportioned to their several ranks, were thrown over the breasts and shoulders of the nobles. For the purpose of arranging the important affairs of every part of the empire, the crescent-shaped falchion, the key to victory over the seven climates, adorned the king's waist; and with liberal hands, like the rain-pouring clouds, he conferred wealth on the triumphant armies. He then, with the determination of subduing the re mainder of Khorasan, displayed his energetic banner, powerful as the sun. In the first place, he or dered, previous to the march of the world-over powering train, his uncle's son, Ibrahim Khan, dig nified as Bahman, to proceed a few days in advance of the victorious troops, with 10,000 infantry and cavalry, all armour-clad, mountained-strength, rock-cleaving, tiger-seizing warriors, each a bastion of flint when halting, each an ocean billow when moving to chastise the rebels of Nishapoor. On the 17th of Muharram, the planet-attended sove reign, in an hour of blessed influence and auspicious omen, like that when lovers meet, placed his foot m the crescent-shaped stirrup; and with the deter mination of proceeding to Khorasan,, the knot was untied from the waving tresses of the victorious standard. In order to muster his cavalry, he pitched the triumphant tents for a few days in thedynasty of the kajars. 157 Plain of Radakan: here Ishak Khan Karaby, and Jaafer Khan Biyat governor of Nishaboor, received honour and splendor from kissing the threshold of the royal tent. Allah Yar Khan also, with Ibrahim Khan Shad Lu governor of Asfarain, Ameer Guneh Khan governor of Khabushan, and other nobles of Khorasan, in the discharge of the rules of devoted- ness and the performance of duty, stood under the shade of the banner powerful as the sun, and listened with respectful attention to the king's com mands. The Prime-minister, Suleiman Khan, was com manded, along with Husain Khan Kullar Agasy, to reduce the Fort of Chenaran: the fortunate prince, Muhammed Aly Mirza, was detached, in conjunc tion with Ishak Khan Karaby Sardar, and a body ot troops selected from the intrepid combatants m the field of battle, towards the holy district (Meshed). The world-subduing train, with a mul titude of blood-shedding lions and ocean-like cro codiles, moved towards Meshed the Holy. On Monday, the 9th of Rabi-ul-awwal, the exterior of Meshed was encompassed by the soldiers of the asylum of victory. Through the devastation and ra vages committed by the intrepid Turks, the bright world became enveloped with gloom in the sight of Nadir Mirza, and of those besieged within the for tifications of calamity and affliction : through the protracted blockade, the fire of scarcity and famine Wazed on high, so that their state became desperate; and the most acute anguish pierced to the very mar- row j when the sublimity of erudition, the intelli-158 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. gence of philosophy and jurisprudence, Mirza Mu- hammed Mehdy of Meshed, the lord of the learned, the practical theorist, turned his face to the thres hold founded in justice, to intercede for the poor and helpless inhabitants of Meshed the Holy. In the sovereign's Paradise-resembling court he hum bly presented a request for the liberation of the famished people from the misery of the blockade:— ' The poor within the fortress have committed no ' sin deserving of the imperial severity, or to cause the royal indignation : the surrender of the for- ' tress, and the expulsion of Nadir Mirza, habituated ' to treachery, are things beyond the power of the ' weak and indigent inhabitants; the keys of the ' city, and the reins which guide the will of the ' garrison, are in that traitor's hands. What im- ' portant difference would it make, if the world- ' subduing sovereign should for a few months de- ' fer the reduction of the fort, and put off the de- ' struction of Nadir Mirza, devoted to a cruel end, ' until the people having devised some stratagem ' in his affairs, and, extricating the reins of direc- ' tion and power from the grasp of his authority, ' could, by means they well know, and within their ' reach, give up the city to the Ministers of the ever- ' lasting empire, and deliver themselves from the 'terror of Nadir Mirza'e tyranny and severity? The Ameers of Khorasan also, having confirmed the statements of this holy personage, guarantied the fulfilment of the agreement: it was besides evident to his majesty's enlightened mind, that if the fort of the holy territory should be taken by storingdynasty of the kajars. 159 then the men and women of the district, now en joying tranquillity under the shadow of the Eight Imams' protection, would become the prey of his blood-shedding warriors, or the sport of his intrepid Turks. Consequently, from the dictates of pure mercy, the king accepted the intercession of this perfect sage; and these stipulations were accepted by the king, and ratified on both sides. His ma jesty also conferred on Husain Khan Kajar Kullar the Sardarship of Khorasan, in addition to the goverment of Nishaboor. The victorious stan dard was then put in motion, in the direction of Teheran, the capital; and during some days the king gave himself up to the pleasures of the chase in Chesmeh Aly, the rival of the groves of Irem: from thence the dust raised by the army, the asylum of victory, became collyrium to the eyes of the inhabitants of Samanan. His highness. Prince Mu- hammed Waly Mirza gave delightful banquets, and piesented suitable offerings to his majesty. During the occurrence of these events, Mahmud Mirza the Afghan, who, as before described, had come to Khoie to solicit the help and support of the climate-conquering sovereign, had turned his face from the monarch dignified as heaven,to the dis trict of Ka'in ; he then collected a small force, and, trusting, to the efficacy of the matchless sovereign's never-failing prosperity, advanced to Kandahar. On t e day of his arrival he spread this intelligence: 'An army of the brave Kajars is approaching, accompa nied by Mahmud Mirza.' When this was reported tu the General stationed in Kandahar on the part of100 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. Zemaun Shah, he, not esteeming himself able to main tain his ground, turned his face to the valley of flight; and thus capricious Fortune, in her sport, gave into the hands of Prince Mahmud the reins of authority over Kandahar. Having left his son Kamran in that country, he advanced rapidly towards Caboul, and there deprived of the ornament of sight Shah Zemaun, who had himself formerly closed the eyes of his brother Kamran, who had only beheld for a few days the heart-adorning beauty of royal power. In this manner Mahmud raised the standard of sovereignty to the heavens. Prince Kaisar, son to Shah Zemaun, who by his father's orders had been appointed Governor of Herat, being alarmed at the approach of his uncle Firoz Mirza, brother to Prince Mahmud, seizing, through terror, the strong cable of royal aid, set out for the crown-bearing so vereign's celestial Durbar. The king, the asylum of the world, omitted no mark of respect toward him; but, on the contrary, raised his dignity to the Polar Star by a succession of royal favours. When his majesty had ended the enjoyment of the chace, he cast the light of equity on the heads of those who repose in the shade of the capital, and, by the arrival there of the auspicious train, conferred honour, with augmented splendor and lustre, on the inhabitants of Teheran.DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 161 CHAP. xxxn. AN ACCOUNT OF THE MARRIAGE FESTIVAL AND THE JOYOUS AND DELIGHTFUL BANQUET OF HIS HIGHNESS, PRINCE ABBAS MIRZA, THE VICEGERENT OF THE EXALTED MONARCHY. T he climate-conquering sovereign's policy, power- fill as fate, irresistible as destiny, urged him to render the portico of the orient sun of monarchy and dominion, the vicegerent of temporal and spi ritual authority. Prince Abbas Mirza, the envy of the lunar mansions, by the rising of the planet en dued with the prosperity of Jupiter and the aspect of Venus; and, through the influence of this happy festival, to make the surface of the earth more de lightful than the heavenly mansions. The gracious order was written in the illustrious name of Mirza Muhammed Khan Davalu Kajar, a noble of that distinguished tribe, and one of the columns of that government which is based on eternity ; demanding chaste daughter, the pearl of the shell of glory, the bud of the rose of nobility, the Mary of the sanctuary of honour, the BalJcis of the throne of grandeur, in marriage for the brave and fortunate youthful prince. The royal mandate was then 1SSUe d fort h with due honour, enjoining suitable ar- rangements, at the centre of dominion, to be made r a princely banquet, for all the preparations re quisite for a royal feast, and for the assembling of le grandees and nobles of the well-protected realm. 10 agents of the Government powerful as the eav ens exerted themselves to complete these augements on a scale befitting a nuptial- enter- uiment: they decorated the streets and houses m162 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. like the area of Paradise; and during the night, the blaze of torches and lamps appeared brilliant fires, like those of Mount Sinai. During the day, from the abundance of all kinds of pleasures and delights, the viands of mental desire and sensual enjoyment were ready prepared for all the world. The won drous power of skilful pyrotechnists was displayed during each night of the joy-exciting festival; the forms of fire-scattering elephants contended with the figures of flame-showering raging lions; and images of gold-taloned dragons hurled out light nings from fiery circles. From the sound of the koorna *, and the soul-delighting harmony of the lyre and of the flute, the cup of existence overflowed with joy and happiness. In short, when one or two weeks had thus passed in festivity and pleasure— ' On a night, soft as the morn of life; ' Joy-exciting, as the day of youth; ' The moon-faced bridemaids removed, in the celestial chamber, ' The veil from the face of the bride ; and then the perfume ' Of the musk of Tartary was borne abroad on the southern breeze.'

Then all the Ameers, Nobles, Ministers, and great men of the Celestial Court, holding lanterns of gold and silver, with the sound of drums and trumpets introduced the litter of the Noshabeh of the age into the Prince-Viceroy's palace, with a splendor that eclipsed the bright luminaries of the skies. In the morning, the Vizirs, Ameers, and Nobles, in order to manifest their gratitude on this auspicious banquet, and to offer their humble congratulations, ^aid costly and beautiful gifts at the feet of the monarch endued with solar energies, obtained the gracious notice of the lord of the world, and had their persons decorated with valuable robes of honour.

It was now asc ertained that Mahmud Mirza was ungrateful 01 his benefactor's bounties, and practised rebellion 111 ^turn for his protector's aid. Finding this, some m 2dynasty of the kajars. of the principal Afghan nobles came to the celestial Durbar; when they represented: ' That a year has ' elapsed since Kaisar Mirza has resided at the ' royal threshold, and since the eyes of his faithful followers have been fixed on what might pass on 44 the road of the royal munificence: now, should ' he, through virtue of the unequalled sovereigns ' fortune, move forward and prevail over his enem}, ' and if, through that superior influence, the sight of his uncle, who is a prey to agony of soul ' on his account, should become dim, he will, un- ' like Mahmud, not only walk in the paths o ' loyalty, but seek the accomplishment of all his ' wishes, through the medium of devoted attac i- ' ment to the imperial court.'—The image of Kaisar Mirza's good faith was reflected on the mirror o the region-conquering sovereign's mind, and the re quest of the Afghan nobles was acceptable to his most noble soul: they were therefore decorate^ with dresses of honour; and Kaisar Mirza, havin, been presented with a diamond-studded sword a poniard, with gold and silver vases, a tent, pavi on, horses, and stores, ultimately obtained permission depart, in the direction of Caboul and Kanda an Letters also, to the following purport, were issue forth to the nobles and chieftains of those region 8 ^ ' That they should regard obedience to the io} ' orders, as an incumbent duty; and should assem) « troops, and establish Kaisar Mirza in his capita •dynasty of the kajars. 165 CHAP.

W hen , from the widely-diffused beauty of spring and from the perfume of the rose, the nightingale became agitated with delight, and the disconsolate turtle-dove on the verdant boughs, and the hyacinth in the parterre, burst out into loud plaints. Prince Abbas Mirza, the vicegerent of temporal and spiritual power, on completing the festival of the new year, wade in his royal residence an entertainment, and presented his respectful offerings to the king: he submitted to the sight powerful as that of the solar orb a thousand precious-stones brilliant as the sun, ten horses with hoofs of steel and slender loins, as many strings of camels with mountain bunches, a thousand purses of gold, Egyptian silks^ Chinese brocades, and imperial satins, besides other valuable objects and stuffs, the enumeration ol which exceeds all power of computation. At this period there arrived at the royal court a repre sentation from the administrators of the district of Asterabad, complaining of the evil practices of the ^amoot and Kokilan tribes, who dwelt on the bank ^ the River Gurgan, and were tributary to the exalted empire of the Kajars. The triumphant r etinue moved from the capital, for the purpose of Siting Mazenderan, and chastising these agitators; an d from thence the musk-diffusing banners shed their influence in the direction of Asterabad. After this, by the fortunate sovereign's order, the victorious166 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. troops marched to the station of Kara Shaikh, in habited by Turkomans: there they kindled the flames of plunder and devastation, and burned their tents: their sons and daughters became the cap tives of the intrepid warriors, and great numbers were slain : those who escaped the sword from fear, requested quarter, and to be allowed to pay tribute. Several also of their distinguished men removed with their families to Teheran, where they seated themselves in the dust of the heaven-founded threshold. The victorious train turned the face of determination from thence to the Plain Kalpush, and next arrived at Chesmeh-i-Ali Boulak, to enjoy the pleasures of the chace. His Highness the Vice gerent of the monarchy then was covered with honour by the imperial presence; and, in company with the climate-conquering monarch, turned their steps to Teheran, the seat of dominion. CHAP. XXXV. AN ACCOUNT OF THE CAPTURE OF THE FORT OF MESHED, AND OF NADIR MIRZA, WITH HIS SONS AND BROTHERS. H usain Khan Kajar Sardar, who had been ap pointed to reduce the fort of Meshed the Holy, and to take Nadir Mirza prisoner, requested from the region-subduing sovereign the aid of Prince Mo hammed Waly Mirza, with an enemy-destroying force. On this, the prudent monarch appointed Muhammed Waly Mirza, with a vengeance -breath ing army, to move towards Khorasan, and take the fort of Meshed the Holy. Whilst the princeDYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 1G7 halted in Nishaboor, Husain Khan Sardar girt on the girdle of persevering exertion, to subdue the fort; and in proportion as the siege advanced, the garrison of the fort became distressed. At the end of the blessed Ramazan, the foe-crushing army detennined to capture the fort, broke up from their entrenchments, and accompanied the prince's stir rup : like the roaring torrent or the loud-sounding ocean, from every side they assaulted its bastions and curtains. The minister of the resplendent Mausoleum, on beholding this state of affairs, shut the gates of the holy threshold, in order to guard the sacred precincts. When Nadir Mirza beheld himself in the jaws of the crocodile of adversity, he fell into trepidation, like a fish in the net of per plexity. He imagined that the present tumult had been excited by the holy and venerable Mirza Muhammed Mahdy of Meshed; and, in conse quence, he turned towards the fortress dedicated to the Imam of celestial dignity, and, through excess of infatuation, broke open with clubs and hatchets the gate of the holy threshold. Accompanied by a great multitude, he traversed with unhallowed steps the sacred sanctuary; and losing sight of all reverence, with his drawn sword he approached the venerable Mirza, at the moment he was en gaged in worship and prayers. After insulting him with abuse, he inflicted deadly wounds on the pure essence of the descendants of the most ex cellent of mankind. He then mounted the steed 0 f flight, and fled towards Chenaran: at this in stant the victorious troops scaled the bastions anddynasty of the kajars. curtains; they got possession oi the tort, and exer cised the hand ot spoil and rapine : but the piince, however, was able to restrain his army from a general plunder. Nadir Mirza, in this great change of con dition,had proceeded in his flight the distance of four farsangs from Meshed, and had dismounted at the encampment of one of the country tribes, when a number of the inhabitants of the desert seized and brought him to the prince (Muhammed Waly)s presence. Through the excess of his misfortune, tears flowed from his eyes: and it so happened that, at the same moment, the bird of the soul of the most learned of men, in consequence of the deadly blows it had received, winged its way to the garden of Paradise. His funeral ceremonies were performed, and his remains deposited near those of the venerable Imaum : he had lived in the odour of sanctity and holiness near seventy years. The prince having in the mean time arrested Nadir Mirza's brothers and sons, sent them in chains and fetters to the court of the peerless sovereign. His imperial majesty brought Nadir Mirza to the court of reproach and castigation, and in person interro gated him. Nadir denied having put the venerable sage to death; and asserted that the wounds he had received were inflicted accidentally, in the tumult and confusion. On the clear proof of that sin, he added a lie to his other crimes: he received due punishment: his brothers also partook of the same bitter draught; and most of his sons being deprived of the ornament of vision, were consigned to the seclusion of disgrace and humiliation.DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 109 CHAP. XXXVI. an account of occurrences in the auspicious year of the hejira 1218 ( a.d . 1803), reing the seventh year of the fortunate reign of his majesty : of the illustrious vicegerent being ordered to chastise the rebels of azarba'ijan: of his departure to the fort of erivan; and of the arrival of the russians. W hen the monarch of the celestial throne with stately gait had entered the porticoes of Aries, and the sultan of spring bestowed verdure on hill and dale, the sovereign of the solar crown with au spicious fortune ascended his diamond-studded throne, and opened his hands to scatter dirhems and dinars. On finishing the festival of the auspi cious Nurooz, his energetic mind was turned to the regulation of temporal and spiritual concerns. As Muhammed Khan Kajar, Beglerbeg of Erivan, had frequently withdrawn his neck from the collar of obedience and loyalty, and had never manifested the sentiments of alacrity and zeal which would have been acceptable to ministers ; but, on the con trary, from the innate ferocity of his soul, forbore to approach the sphere of royalty—misdeeds which the strength of the fortress he possessed tended also to inflame; he became well pleased with the in creasing power of the Russians, who at this period had found their way to Gary ah and Teflis—a de tailed account of which affairs shall shortly proceed from the pen of description: suffice it, at present, to say, that Muhammed Khan by no means wished the country to beat once cleared of the invading strangers, especially as the world-adorning royal will required170 dynasty of the kajars. that the fortress of Erivan should be evacuated by his troops, and its bastions and battlements be mounted with experienced and faithful soldiers. His majesty having however effected this, deter mined to proceed, with unshaken purpose, to expel the enemy, and to lower their standards in the dust. Therefore, in order to organize the kingdom of Azarba'ijan, to free the surface of the district of Erivan from the presence of strangers, and to re form those who were criminal, the illustrious Vice gerent of the monarchy. Prince Abbas Mirza, was ordered to Erivan, with a well-equipped army of infantry and cavalry. It has been before stated, that the Prince-Viceroy's Vizir, the essence of vir tue, Mirza Isa, styled Mirza Bazung, had been ap pointed to superintend the important concerns of Teheran, as well as to arrange the affairs of Hasan Aly Mirza, the governor of that Paradise-like region: on this account, therefore, the Vizir of enlightened mind, an Asuf in prudence, the realm-adorning wisdom of Mirza Muhammed Shafia, was ordered to attend the victorious retinue, accompanied by a num ber of Kajar Ameers, such as, Suleiman Khan Ka- wat Lu, Mahdy Kuly Khan Kawat Lu, Mahdy Kuly Khan Dava Lu, Raza Kuly Khan, Pir Kuly Khan, Najuf Khan, and Alia Verdy Khan Kajar; and of the Khans of Azarba'ijan, Ahmed Khan Mukaddam, Beglerbeg, Abul Fatah Khan Juwan Shir, Aghuz Lu Khan, son of Juwad Khan Ganjah, and Alak- sander Mirza; of the Ameers of Sardah mdHazarah, Aly Kuly Khan Shahun; also the troops of Sha- kaki, Shahun, and others. The Viceroy was alsodynasty of the kajars. 171 attended by the insignia of royal pomp—the tent, the pavilion, the royal chamber, the audience cham ber, the fort-demolishing zambooraks, the joy-an nouncing drums, and the hoarse-sounding trumpets. The fortunate sovereign came out of his capital to bid adieu to his son, and behold the victorious camp at the first halting-place of the Prince Viceroy, render ing the site of this encampment the envy of the celestial spheres; and, from his perfect liberality, he bestowed on the illustrious prince a coat of mail in close links, which had been handed down to the region-conquering sovereign, through successive generations, from Tuly Khan, son of Jengheez Khan. At the end of Zi-hajjah-ul-Haram, the auspicious train moved forward, in the direction of Azarba'ijan. On coming to Kazwin, Prince Muhammed Aly Mirza hastened to meet his brother, with a splendid pro cession, and displayed all the duties of hospitality and affection. In the territory of Azarba'ijan, the Beglerbegs and the other magistrates pressed for ward to wait on him with suitable presents; and, through the gracious kindness of the illustrious Viceroy, their prospects were enlarged. The Vice roy employed his energy in spreading out the carpet of justice, and in securing the tranquillity of the cultivators and dependents; and the unequalled ^ izii laid down also in his soul the rules of universal piotection, so that, in the district of Erivan, the C10 l)s an d property, in each and every part of it, should be exempt from the violence of the dread- sti iking hosts; which, from the terror of punish- ment, prevented any one taking away the poor172 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. Durveish's lamb, and secured the pitiless heart from trampling a single ear of corn under his horse's foot. By order of the eminent vicegerent of the mo narchy, despatches, accompanied by envoys, were sent from the royal residence of Tabreez, to Mu- hammed Khan Kajar, Beglerbeg of Erivan, min gled with counsels, blending threats with promises, containing exhortations, arguments and motives, in ducing him to expedition in tendering his allegi ance, and in executing such orders as emanated from the court of the sovereign dignified as Jam- shid : but his innate fierceness prevented him from comprehending the extent of the Prince Regent's liberality : he even obliged the cultivators and tribes of Erivan to emigrate; some to the borders of Ba'izid and Van, and others in various directions. He then closed the gates of the fortress, and posted him self behind the fortifications. A trusty messenger was also sent to Teflis, to invite the Russians to his aid; at the same time exhorting them to give battle to the Viceroy, and promising to surrender to them the fortress when they had subdued the troops of Iran. CHAP. XXXVII. A CONCISE ACCCOUNT OF THE SITUATION OF THE RUSSIAN EMPIRE, AND OF THE ENTRANCE OF THAT NATION INTO GURJISTAN. T he Russian empire contains extensive kingdoms: one half of it is in Europe, and the other in Asia: it is bounded on the north by the Frozen Ocean; on the south, by Chinese Tartary, MoghuLTartary, the Sea of Khazar (the Caspian), Ajamistan (Persia),dynasty of the kajars. 173 and the Black Sea; on the east, by the Sea of Japan; on the west are the Othman Empire, Lah (Poland), and Aswaj (Sweden). In this empire there are lofty mountains, many lakes, and numberless forests: the air is exceedingly cold, and its pro duce inconsiderable ; and, excepting barley, there is produced no other grain which can be laid up. Among the different species of animals, the bear, fox, ermine, and black-sable, are very numerous. In those countries bordering on Lah (Poland), it is more cultivated, and its granaries more abundantly blessed. The capital of the Russian Empire is the City of Peterburgh, erected by the Emperor Peter ♦. It is a great and populous city, through which the River Narwah passes, and flows into the Baltic Sea: the population of the city is about 150,000 souls. This city contains, in its quarters, beautiful commercial establishments, and admirable places for shipping. The part of the empire si tuated in Europe is divided into thirty-two govern ments : the inhabitants of Russia, since the time of * The following are the Sovereigns from 1696 to 1825; Peter I. surnamed the Great . . . . 1696 Catherine I. his widow 1725 Peter II.

The commodities of the country are all kinds of skins, furs, talc, iron, resin, pitch, tar, dried fish, and cloths. To the Emperor Peter, so distinguished for wisdom and science, the Russians owe the regu lations and maxims which are at present current among them, in all matters relative to the govern ment of towns, the defence of the frontier, military tactics and evolutions, the discipline of infantry and cavalry, as well as the dispensation of laws and jus tice. The Emperor Peter lived about a century ago: he was of the royal family of Russia; and, through his natural genius, bore away the prize of sagacity and penetrating judgment from the lists of fortune. He had a daughter, a son, and a wife. As the emperor directed his most earnest attention to the * The following is the account of this extraordinary man which Louis XV. gives to Madame du Barri:— ' Je me rappele que bien jeune encore je re^us la visite du Czar ' Pierre le Grand, veux-je dire.

She has already assigned one of the highest to Peter, the Father, the Founder (if one may say so) of his country; and one, low as Tophet, to the silly, debauched, profligate, profuse tyrant, Louis XV. + This line is entirely defaced in the Manuscript; with the ex ception of the words ' Russian religion,' at the commencement; and 44 is inclined to,' at the end of the line.dynasty of the kajars. 175 due arrangement of the state of the cultivators and military, he therefore established a new Code of Laws, and compiled a book resembling the Vasa Nameh of Jengheez Khan; the regulations con tained in which code the Russians observe to this day, and pursue the maxims and policy which it contains. It is only since the publication of this code that the Russians have attained power and superiority, and that their emperors have acquired unlimited sway, and devoted themselves to internal improvements and to the national observances. About the termination of the Sefavi dynasty, when Mahmud the Afghan, having rebelled against the Shah Sultan Husain Sefavy, advanced to Isfahan and there besieged him, unjust aggressions, and the invasion of Azarba'ijan and Irak, took place on the part of the Turks, Shah Sultan Husain despatched his son Tehmasp Mirza to Azarba'ijan, hoping per chance that he might, by exertion, relieve the in habitants from the Afghan oppression. Tehmasp Mirza, on his arrival, and on witnessing the situation and ravages of the Othman troops in that defence less country, despaired of effecting any thing by means of the people themselves, and unthinkingly turned to implore assistance from the Russian Em peror. For this purpose he resigned to him several districts, on the condition of receiving effectual aid, to put an end to the source of mischief arising from the evil-disposed Afghans. The Russian Emperor, being desirous to find an entrance into Iran, set out with a numerous force ; and leaving his eldest son as Viceroy, advanced as far as the boundaries176 dynasty of the ka.iars. of Derbend. At this conjuncture, his son, who was in Peterburgh, became openly hostile to him. On learning this, Peter was profoundly agitated and troubled, and was, of necessity, obliged to return to his capital. He there assembled the priests and nobles, and explained to them his son's rebellion; for the punishment of which criminal conduct, he, ac cording to the dictates of policy, decreed his death, and carried the sentence into execution. After that, he again laid the foundation of commercial intercourse with the people of Iran, and arranged the means of insinuating himself into the country, as far as the limits of Resht and Derbend, about the time that the Afghans had martyred Shah Sultan Husain. After which, Nadir Shah appeared, and brought destruction on the Afghan prosperity: he also cleared the kingdom of Iran from the pre sence of the Othman forces. He next subdued Hindustan and Turkistan : after which he turned his attention towards blocking up the roads against the hostile designs of the Russians; and, in order to remove all pretences, despatched a Letter and Ambassador to that Government. As the Russians, however, had completely ascertained the hostile intentions and power of Nadir Shah, they instantly removed the foundations they had laid for entering into Persia, and, closing up the budget which they opened in Resht and Derbend, they took away the residents to their own country, subscribing a treaty* to this purport:—'From this time, the Russian ' Emperor shall not move a single step beyond the * See copy of this Treaty in the Notes.dynasty of the kajars. 177 ' limits of his own country, but will always walk ' in the path of friendship with the Government of ' Iran.' As Nadir Shah's power attained the greatest eminence, the Russian Government faith fully observed the stipulated treaty, until the Em peror Peter departed to the other world. After him, his consort sat on the throne, and placed the diadem on her head. When some time had elapsed, she, too, exchanged the throne for the bier; and her daughter, who was possessed of heart-overpowering perfection and world-adorning splendor, obtained the royal dignity. After some time, she also de parted, by the destined path of mortality, to the regions of darkness; and the Russian Empire became greatly alarmed in consequence of the failure of Peter's lineage : affairs were neglected, and the con cerns of the State thrown into confusion. Whereas from ancient times the Namsah court (i.e. German) has been the capital of the European kings, who have derived their dignity, grandeur, and authority from the German Emperor, the successor of Kaisar, therefore intelligent and wise persons were sent from Russia to demand from him a prince who should put the affairs of the Russian State in order. The Emperor selected, as their sovereign, a Ger man prince, in whose family the royal dignity had continued, without interruption, during seven hundred years. He also sent to Russia, as his consort, Ekatarinah*, a princess endowed with * The following sums are stated, it is said from good autho- rit J'to have been squandered by Catherine on her lovers:— 'The five,,brothers Orloffs received 45,000 pea- Ruble8 - nuble8 - sants; and in lands, palaces, jewels, plate, and money 17,000,000 N Vissensky,178 dynasty of the kajars. consummate understanding and profound sagacity, and seated her on the throne.

Among the ex traordinary accidents of fortune, it happened one day that the Emperor had placed his mistress in a private apartment during the time he himself was employed in holding a court; but as his heart was wholly devoted to this beloved object, he eagerly desired, on being released from business, to pass some time in the enjoyment of her society. Now it so happened, that Ekatarinah passed through the apartment in which this lady was placed; and the damsel, from the arrogance inspired by her convic tion of the Emperor's devoted attachment, failed to pay due respect to Ekatarinah. The latter, there fore, through royal indignation and elevated rank, and burning with the flame of envy and jealousy, gave her a slap on the face. As it had been laid down in the code of Peter, that if any person should be guilty of an act contrary to the rules and sta tutes contained therein, or perpetrate any for bidden crime, the Vizirs and supreme judges should assemble in court, and proceed to investigation and proof, and then by a general decree to ordain the punishment affixed to that act, and order the appointed sentence to be executed: from whence no person has the power to oppress the Em peror's pensioners, who derive their subsistence a ud salaries from the court, or inflict injury on the weak and destitute peasantry. In consequence of these regulations, the fire of indignation burst forth lnt o flames from the recesses of the silver-bosomed damsel's heart, and tears streamed from her eyes.182 dynasty of the kajars. While in this deplorable state the Emperor entered the chamber, and, on beholding her, inquired, from his extreme attachment and love, the cause of her weeping; which she, amidst sighs, sobs, and tears, related to him. The Emperor, endeavouring to comfort her, said : ' Let not this, my soul, trouble ' our delight: continue to love me; since, for the in- ' jury you have received, I am authorised by law to ' imprison Ekatarinah.' He then gave an order to the Do Deh, who are twenty in number, to confine Ekatarinah in a fort in the city of Peterburg, and to prevent all ingress and egress. This order was acted on ; and in the mean time, the Emperor, with the Vizir's daughter, retired, for the purpose oi en joying undisturbed pleasure and delight, to a place called Peterhof, a truly delightful situation, and an enchanting structure, two parasangs from Peterburg. In this retirement he spread the carpet of happiness, and circulated the cup of pure wine. The damsel's head however became heated with wine ; and in this state of intoxication, Ekatarinah's insult occurring to her mind, she again began to weep : on which the Emperor said, ' I have imprisoned Ekatarinah be- ' cause she insulted you, and yet the dust of melan- ' choly remains on the pages of your soul: cast ' away care; embrace me, and cease your tears; for ' I shall send two soldiers to put her to death and ' shed her blood; and thus assure your not receiv- ' ing any further trouble or oppression from her. ' I mean also, to-morrow, to take you to church, ' and elevate you, by the bond of marriage, to Eka- ' tarinah's place, and by this gracious alliance raise ' your head to the skies.' Among the guards otdynasty op the kajars. 183 the court then on duty, and who heard these words, were two soldiers, who said to each other,' In our qua- a lity of the select twenty, through fatigue and wea- ' riness we are reduced to the greatest extremities : ' it is therefore our interest to hasten from hence with ' all expedition, and have a conference with Ekata- ' rinah in the prison, to acquaint her with this heart- ' rending intelligence, and to employ all our energies ' for her liberation ; so that, in return for this im- ' portant service, we may attain to exalted dignity 'and elevated rank.' On this, they instantly hastened away; and found Ekatarinah's guards at the prison-door, to whom they thus spoke : ' The ' Eniperor has sent us to Ekatarinah with a message, ' which we are to deliver to none else but herself ' in person ; but as we cannot be admitted into the ' fort, let her come to the door and listen to the ' Emperor's message.' Ekatarinah, being on this permitted to come to the castle-door, they respect fully informed her of the Emperor's words; and said: Behold! even now some soldiers are coming, who ' make you taste the poison of death : take therefore some step to remedy your condition, and for this purpose adopt every measure within ' the compass of ability and reflection.' Ekatarinah, 011 bearing this, fell at their feet, and addressed them in terms of supplication and grief. The chiefs of the ten *, appointed to guard her, then said : ' If you will promote us to the dignity of the ' Vizir's office, we will first deliver you from prison; and after that, being guided by your sagacious ' counsels and profound policy, we shall bring * Twenty I presume.184 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. ' destruction on the Emperor's fortune.'' Ekatarinah, who wrote a most beautiful hand, drew up an agree ment in her own writing, to the following purport ' That if they (the chiefs of the twenty) possessed ' perfect intelligence, and sagacity comprehensive ' enough for the administration of the State, she &lt;&lt; would promote them to the high rank of Vizir; ' but if they were deficient in these qualities, she ' would bestow on them joy and happiness, by ap- ' pointing them to the government of some of the ' provinces of the empire.' Having received this engagement, they tied ropes together, fastened the extremity of them to her waist, and, letting hei down from the roof, got her out of the castle. She then said to them : ' You must now conduct me to ' the quarter of the Nobles and Ministers who have ' been put in prison on account of their religious ' opinions.' They instantly complied with this order. When the prisoners beheld the Emperoi s consort, they respectfully bared their heads and kissed the ground, and Ekatarinah thus addressed them : ' This infatuated man has imprisoned you on ' account of your peculiar religious opinions, an ' made you despair of ever more tasting the pleasures ' of life.' She then ordered the chains to be removed from their hands and feet, and addressed them again in most gracious words, and made large promises to this body of nobles : in consequence of which they applied themselves, the same night, to collect then friends and associates; and having assembled abou 5000 persons, they set out with Ekatarinah to ma 'e an attack on the Emperor. Now a part of the site of Peterburg is in what was formerly the Swedisdynasty of the kajars. 185 territory : the Russian Government, therefore, through vigilance, lest the above-mentioned people should attack the city on the sea-side, always keep near the shore, in a state of complete readiness, a vessel manned with experienced soldiers, and abun dantly supplied with military stores of every descrip tion. When Ekatarinah crossed over this place, she announced to the mariners and officers, ' The royal ' order is to this purport: ' Whoever shall attempt ' to cross over from this side, or come among these ' vessels, must be taken prisoner : and should that ' person have recourse to hostility or violence, you ' must cause the surface of the water to blaze with the fire of artillery, and consume with the de- ' structive flames both the vessel that conveys ' him and the bark of his existence/ ' After this, she hastened to attack the infatuated Emperor ; and having taken him prisoner, she thus addressed him in reproachful terms : ' O heedless fool! every na- ' tion in the world has its peculiar faith, and every ' individual his peculiar mode of worship; what, ' then, could induce you to the attempt of convert- ' ing the people of Moscow to the faith of Ger- ' many, and to throw the Ministers and Nobles ' of the State into bonds and imprisonment ? ' Among the rules of conduct pursued by Chris- ' tian sovereigns, in what age has this practice ever ' prevailed, of putting to death a faithful and ' affectionate consort of royal blood, to take in ' her place, in the ties of marriage, a plebeian con- 'sort?' He replied: 'What was to be, has ' come to pass, and fate has had its course: my ' only request now is, that wherever I may180 dynasty of the kajaks. ' be, you suffer me to keep my sword, and my ' dog, the only faithful companion I have.' Eka- tarinah answered: 'You have no longer power to retain even these objects near you.' She then commanded the officers to bear him away. He was instantly forced away, and conveyed to some secret place, which no one has ever been able to discover. Ekatarinah, after this, ascended the throne, rewarded her associates, and conferred on them the dignity of Vizir, with unlimited autho rity. During a long period the pie-bald courser of fortune was obedient to her, and she administered the State with perfect splendor and authority. It was, however, the great object of her wishes to take advantage of any event which might occur, to break the solemn compact made with the Persian Go vernment ; so as to have a pretext for entering into Gurjistan {i.e. Georgia), and introduce hersell by some means into that realm, either by artifice and deceit, or open hostility and warfare. In the com mencement of the reign of the deceased sovereign, Muhammed Shah Kajar, his brother Murtaza Kuly Khan, as has been previously explained, fled away from his majesty, and attached himself to the Rus sian Emperor. At first his arrival was regarded as a happy circumstance, and the Russians conferred on him all kinds of distinction and favours: they gave him the crown, the sash, and purses of silver and gold, and gratified his desires in a thousand ways. He was permitted to reside at Teflis; and the Russian Government constantly furnished him profusely with the means of passing his time happily* and with all the refinements of artifice, continually■ DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 187 directing their energies to accomplish their ori ginal object; and Murtaza Kuly Khan, on his part, was always impelling and tempting them to invade the Persian Empire. At the time when Teflis was captured (an enterprise which was, through the determined prowess of the deceased sovereign, at tended with complete success), Erakly Khan was thrown into despair, and the Governors of Daghestan, Shirwan, and Karabagh, had their minds filled with alarm by the martyred sovereign's irresistible force. Ekatarinah looked on this as a favourable con juncture for breaking the solemn compact existing between the two countries. An experienced general, to whose prudent mind the most important affairs had been entrusted, and to whose sagacious discern ment the execution of the most weighty concerns had been committed, was ordered to advance, with 40,000 soldiers and a train of artillery, by way of Derbend. This general had lost in battle one leg by a cannon- ball, and its place was supplied with one of gold: bis name was Larry an*, and he was styled Kuzzal lyttgh (i.e. Gold Leg). He invested Derbend, and thought to break down the walls of the fortress with cannon-balls; but as the foundation of the castle and the walls were of stone, no breach was effected by many thousand balls. After a siege of some months, during which Sheik Aly Khan and the people the place had enveloped in blood and dust the amputated heads and bodies of the Russians, a per- So n named Khizzar Beg, belonging to the house hold ot Sheik Aly Khan, and Faty Aly Khan, his ather, shutting their eyes to the gratitude due to ^ Count Valerian Zuboff'.188 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. their benefactors, associated themselves with some mean wretches, and, by surprising the garrison, gave up Derbend to the Russians; and Kuzzal lyagh marched from thence, with the design of advancing to the Plain of Mughan. This intelligence was reported in Khorasan to the late sovereign, at the moment he was setting out to subdue Kharezm and Tur- kistan ; when, on hearing the account of the Rus sians advancing to Mughan, he immediately di rected his course to Teheran. Here he entirely devoted himself to assembling a mighty army, and to concerting the most vigorous measures for repelling and opposing the Russians; and just at this period news came to Kuzzal lyagh, that Ekatarinah, the Russian sovereign, had departed from this abode, full of delusion, to those regions where all doubts are removed. On the receipt of this intelligence, the Russians marched away from Mughan, and re turned to their own country. After Ekatarinah, her son, Paulovitch, ascended the imperial throne. He put to death several Nobles and Ministers who had been guilty of the foul deed of removing his father, and who were still alive at the time of his accession. At last, through his evil conduct, the Russian Nobles and Ministers deprived him of power and life, and seated in his place his son, Alexander Paulovitch, on the throne. He also, conformably to Ekatarinah s long-concerted policy, determined on violating the ancient treaties entered into with the Persian Go vernment. At this time Erakly Khan turned his face to the other world; and dissensions arose be tween his eldest son, Gurgeen Khan, and his other children: in consequence of which, Alexander Mirzn,dynasty of the kajars. 189 one of his sons, hastened to the exalted court of Iran, where he received the greatest attention; whilst Alexander Paulovitch employed every means to in trigue with and flatter Gnrgeen Khan. He sent to Teflis one of his Ministers, named Sisan Lud *, with a large force of infantry, and several pieces of can non ; and this person was known in Iran by the name of Askpukhdar, a man eminent for resolution and high spirit. To him Gurgeen Khan, through infatuation, closing his eyes to the consequences, tendered submission, and gave up the city of Teflis to the Russian Ministers ; so that he, in truth, kin dled, with his own hands, a fire which consumed not only his own family, but many others besides. In the mean time the wolf of Destiny snatched away Gurgeen Khan; and on the death of this un fortunate prince, the Russian general prepared to send as prisoners to the Russian capital. Queen Dodah Fal (now exposed to this severe reverse of fortune), with several of her children and friends : and as Dodah Fal hesitated. General Nazru came, on the part of Ashpukhdar, and said, You must proceed immediately, without any further delay.' Dodah Fal still excused herself; and the general then came forward to seize Dodah Fal's hand, and force her to depart. The queen happened to have under her nummud {i.e. carpet on which she was seated) a poniard, called a Kumah; which she in stantly drew, and, stabbing General Nazru, wounded Wm mortally. Her son, Tehmuras Khan, however, fled from Gurjistan, and arrived at the court of the climate-conquering sovereign. * Zizianow.100 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. CHAP. XXXVIII. AN ACCOUNT OF THE RUSSIANS OBTAINING POSSESSION OF THE FOR TRESS OF GANJAII, BY MEANS OF THE ARMENIANS RESIDING THERE. As the Russians had now opened the budget of settlement in Gurjistan, they became desirous to introduce their power into all the adjacent countries and places ; and for this purpose they often directed their forces against even the almost inaccessible recesses of Jarotulla, and shed a great deal of inno cent blood. In the month of Ramazan of the year 1218 (a.d. 1803), they displayed their standards in the direction of Ganjah. Juwad Khan Kajar, the governor, reported this circumstance to the Durbar of the sovereign, powerful as Jamshid; and al though a body of troops from the royal residence proceeded to his assistance with all possible expedi tion, yet, on account of the great distance, not a soul had reached it except Said Beg, the Ghoolam, who rode chapa'ry (i.e. post) : when Ashpukhdai, having invested the fort, inflicted great misery on the governor and people of Ganjah, who were caught m the snare of torture. At the commencement of the siege, Juwad Khan once or twice made some manly exertions; but at last Nasib Beg Shams uddeen Lu, and the Armenians of Ganjah, through their attachment to the besiegers, girded themselves to betray him, agreeably to a concerted plan. On the morn of the first day of Shawal, a general assault from every side was made; which the defenders of theDYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 191 fort advanced to repel, and to drive back the enemy with weapons of every description. It so happened, however, that the defenders of one of the bastions* disregarding the laws of vigilance, had retired to their home before the occurrence of this event : the Russian and Georgian soldiers scaled that very bastion, took the fort, and during three hours gave themselves up to slaughter and plunder. They put to the sword Juwad Khan, with one of his sons, and 3600 persons besides. After the capture of the fort, and the perpetration of this foul massacre, they expelled from the fort the survivors of every class, high and low; and that strong fort, which had been garrisoned by True Believers only, being emptied of every resident, the infidels established themselves in the pastures and quarters of the country. After this astounding event, Ashpukhdar, giving way to pride and arrogance, despatched mes sengers to the Governors of Karabagh and Erivan, urging them to submit, and surrender their respec tive forts. Although these governors were appa rently loyal in the discharge of their duty, yet in wardly they were not sorry to have pretences of this nature, to plead as reasons for delay and neglect ln executing the royal orders, and in performing the commands of the Government. It was during these events that the matchless sovereign was engaged in the reduction of Khorasan ; so that the account of it, coupled with the intelligence of the capture ol Meshed the Holy, the sanctuary of Reza, $ t presume Nasib Beg Shams uddeen Lu and the Armenians to ' Klve been stationed in this bastion.192 dynasty of the kajars. both reached the court at the same time; like the messenger-bee, bearing at once his honey and his stinsj. It was on this account, as has been before stated, that the Vicegerent of the monarchy, with a countless host, hastened to Azarba'ijan, and commanded the fort of Erivan to be invested; a summary account of which shall shortly be recorded by the descriptive pen. CHAP. XXXIX. ORDERS ARE GIVEN TO MAHDY KULY KHAN DAVA LU, THE VICE GERENT OF THE MONARCHY, TO REMOVE THE TRIBES OF ERIVAN, KAJAR, AND KUNKERLU. T he Prince Viceroy, on the 14th of Safar, proceeded, with a numerous army from Tabreez, the seat of Government, in the direction of Erivan ; and on ar riving at the tenth parasang from Erivan, the royal pavilion was pitched, and strong entrenchments thrown up, without delay, on the bank of the River Z&amp;ngy. On the very day of their arrival, prepara tions were made to give battle to the garrison ot the castle. As the Prince Viceroy's attention was always fixed on the improvement of the country and the comforts of the people, his profound sagacity enjoined, therefore, that the Rayas and tribes ot Erivan should, by kind measures, be induced to settle in their original habitations, and be assured ot protection and security against the depredations ot the victorious troops. Conformably to this P^ 111 ' despatches and ordinances, calculated to bring about a peace between the Persian and Turkish Govern ments, were issued from the prince's Durbar to theDYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. governors of the Passes, and to the Pashas, whether distant or near, and demanding the return of the tribes and clans of Erivan. The prince commanded Mahdy Kuly Khan Davalu Kajar, with 6000 resolute horsemen, to proceed in the direction of Ba'izid with these instructions: that, in the first place, he should employ measures of conciliation, to persuade the chiefs and their tribes to return; on which he was to give them assurance of the royal sympathy and protection, and to conduct them to their original abodes: but if mildness and condescension were found to be of no avail, or reluctance to remove should be manifested, in such case the argument to be used was the edge of the sabre; and in the latter case he was authorised to capture males and females, and to plunder all their property. When Mahdy Kuly Khan arrived in that district, the Pashas of the country advanced to meet him with sincerity and integrity, and openly manifested the proper respect to the imperial commands. They obliged the tribes of Kajar and Kunkar Lu to emigrate ; and delivered them, with their herds and flocks, to the absolute disposal of Mahdy Kuly Khan, who urged them forward, marching in the direction of Erivan. At this juncture, Ashpukhdar, with 20,000 flame- scattering infantry, 5000 or 6000 cavalry, and thirty pieces of cannon, encountered Mahdy Kuly ^han in the station of Pamhak in Erivan. As the Persian forces had orders to conduct, by de- ^chments, the herds and flocks of the tribes, Mahdy Kuly Khan therefore, with 700 cavalry un- ( ^ r his immediate command, formed a rampart194&lt; dynasty of the kajars. against the Demon (Magog) of Calamity, and en gaged in battle with the Russians: like a furious torrent he wheeled round to the charge, until he had conducted in safety the remainder of the army, the tribes, and clans, to their cantonments in the adja cent villages; after which he joined the royal camp. CHAP. XL. an account of the akrival of ashpukhdar to the assistance of muhammed khan of erivan ; and of his battles and engagements with the prince viceroy. Ashpukhdar , after halting a few days in the station of Pambak in Erivan, about the end of Rabi-ul- awwal, on the afternoon of Sunday, moved from thence with great pomp and an immense force, his head filled with malice and intrigue, and carrying about him the merchandize of pride and insolence. When the Russians had reached the territory of Erivan, a body of their troops, thinking that the Fort of Ouch Kilisia had been evacuated, approached near it: a small detachment of infantry from the ever-triumphant army, however, had been stationed there for the defence of the fort. At this conjunc ture, they grasped their muskets, and, posting them selves in silence near the walls, showered down the hard knots of the musket-balls upon the hearts o the enemy, so that many were killed and wounde . The advanced picquets of the victorious army reported this circumstance to the Prince Vicoioy about sunset: on which he ordered Aly Kuly Khan Shahun, an intrepid and prudent warrior, and (e- votedly attached to the court, the asylum of justice, to post himself in hostile ambush, with a body oDYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 195 determined champions, in the vicinity of Ouch Kili- sia: they were to observe the Russian movements, and, by means ol shouts, crying out, uproar and clamour, not suffer them to enjoy any repose until the dawn appeared. On the morning of Monday, the infantry and cavalry of the heaven-resembling camp arose from the ground, and covered their breasts and shoulders with arms of every descrip tion. Whereas on such a day, if the entrench ments were left without troops, it seemed probable that the garrison of Erivan might take advantage of this opportunity suddenly to inflict great loss on the stores and baggage; the Prince Viceroy, therefore, with consummate prudence and vigilance, appointed the Asuf of majesty, Mirza Muhammed Shafi, Vizir, with Ahmed Khan Mukaddam, go vernor of Tabreez and Maragah, to guard the en trenchments with a corps of infantry and cavalry. The army of the True Believers, in their respective battalions, then marched out, and, being collected under the shadow of the Prince Viceroy's heaven- soaring banner, hastened, from the right and left, to the field of battle: through the loud din of the war-drum, and the clangor of the trumpet, uproar pervaded the empyrean sphere, and trembling fell 0 n all parts of the earth. Ashpukhdar, the Russian chief, who was in the vicinity of Ouch Kilisia, on ^holding the Prince Viceroy's march and move ments, commenced drawing out his line and the array of his thousands : he divided the dragon-like ?uns, and the infantry, furious as crocodiles, into three columns, so that 200 paces intervened between o 2196 dynasty of the kajars. each column: he himself, like a devouring flame, took post amidst the fire-vomiting guns. When both armies drew near each other, the llussians, in the beginning of the battle, having recouise to their world-alarming artillery, began to hurl about cannon- balls capable of cleaving asunder the mighty Alhurz, uproot the peak of Kaf, rive* the solid rocks, and destroy the arrangement of the Pleiades. The thunders and lightnings of their fire-diffusing guns, with raging flames, mounted to the vaults of heaven. On beholding this, the army of the True Believers, by order of the Viceroy of temporal and spiritual power, advanced from their lines; while the horse men of the Shahun, Khagawand, and Abdul Maliky tribes, on their steeds rapid as the whirlwind, strong as the earth, fleet as the current, charged one of the fire-scattering columns. The Russians, from three sides, showered on their heads and hel mets cannon and musket-balls like hail-stones; but these undaunted horsemen charged impetuously in the midst of the raging flame, and, with the edge of the blood-scattering sword, besprinkled the celestial * « Rive the solid rocks,' placed as it is, is a superb instance of the bathos; nearly, however, equalled by the following:— ' Nor art nor nature has the force To stop its steady course; Nor Alps nor Pyreneans keep it out, Nor fortified redoubt.'

The denseness of the smoke and dust was so great, that another firmament appeared in the at mosphere ; in the midst of which flashed the sharp arrows of the brave, like blazing stars. The Russian infantry, stubborn as enraged tigers, at the same time enveloping with gloom and light the surface of the field of battle, through the lightning and smoke issuing from their artillery and musketry, at last began to waver and lose ground, and fled to join the other column. On this, the ever-triumphant army gave themselves up to the plunder and spoil of the tents, and the making of prisoners. Ash- pukhdar, from the fear of the issue of the battle, and the rapid charges of the brave warriors, threw himself on his side, and was every moment giving directions by the motion of his hand, and exciting his infantry to renewed exertion : but when the sovereign of mid-day declined to his western chambers, and the curtain of darkness began to interpose before the e yes of mortals, the prince's army withdrew their hand from battle, and, quitting the area of strife and contention, reposed in their own quarters. A great many were wounded or slain on both sides ; and many of the Russian and Cossack horsemen were taken prisoners. Ashpukhdar, who, through exces sive arrogance, had imagined himself the perfection ^ heroism, and had, in the commencement of the campaign, in conjunction with the resolute warriors ^urjistan, written to the Russian Emperor letters pledging himself to subdue the Persian Empire with thls ver y army, on witnessing this overpowering198 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. superiority on the side of Persia, and being openly defeated, retired from the field of battle, biting the hand of mortification with the teeth of despair; while the army of the Faithful, divided into different detachments, having taken post in stations fit for ambush, and secured positions adapted for hostili ties, cut off their provisions and water. CHAP. XLI. AN ACCOUNT OF THE SUBMISSION OF MUHAMMED KHAN KAJAR, BEGLERBEG OF ERIVAN, THROUGH THE CONCILIATORY MEANS EMPLOYED BY THE ASUF OF MAJESTY, MIRZA MAHDY SHAFI, THE VIZIR. When Muhammed Khan Kajar,Beglerbeg of Erivan, who, from excessive alarm, had, with the flints of shamefulness and depravity, kindled such a destruc tive fire, looked attentively, he found himself to be the fuel of the infernal flames, and began to gnaw the finger of repentance with the teeth of astonish ment. Being now aroused into prudence from the intoxication of oblivion, and being awakened from the sleep of folly, he once more determined to walk in the paths of sincerity and purity, and to retrace his steps in the road of loyalty and fidelity. He therefore urgently solicited, from the residents ot the court, permission for the unequalled V izir to visit the fortress; in order that the flame of alarm and perverseness might be extinguished by the pure water of the counsels and heart-soothing ments of the Asuf of the age, and the mantle ot pardon and indulgence be cast over his own shame ful deeds ; and in order that, after the pardon of hisDYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 199 crimes, he might be allowed to present his allegiance at the court, exalted as Saturn, and be honoured and blessed by an interview with his majesty. According to his desire, the Asuf of majesty, Mirza Muhammed Shafi, the Vizir, joined him in the castle; and having made him expect the boundless indulgence of the victorious sovereign, and the un limited sympathy of the Prince Viceroy, returned to the royal camp. On this, Muhammed Khan despatched his son, with considerable presents, to wait on the Prince Viceroy, and pledged himself to loyalty and unbounded devotedness. CHAP. XLII. AN ACCOUNT OF THE RUSSIANS' ADVANCING TO THE FORTRESS OF ERIVAN, AND OF THEIR ENGAGEMENT WITH THE GARRISON. T he Prince Viceroy having marched from the sta tion of Sangar, halted at Karagh Bulak; where he rested a few days, to collect means of transport for the army. The implacable Ashpukhdar, on learning Muhammed Khan's submission to the Ministers of the fortunate State, and ascertaining his obedience to the officers of the Celestial Palace, became greatly incensed; and in order to reduce the Fort of Erivan, put in motion his artillery, infantry, and stores, and advanced with the whole of his terror-spread ing, flame-diffusing force, by way of a valley, which separated him from the prince's camp. The prince, on beholding this, mounted his mighty desert-tra versing charger. It so happened, that on this day the chief officers of the army, utterly neglecting a proper attention to their duties, were tranquilly200 dynasty of the kajars. seated in the tents of indulgence, and the people of the camp had sent out their cattle to graze in the neighbouring pastures. The prince, with the greatest haste and activity, assembled together whatever infantry and cavalry could be found; and drawing them up in order of battle, in the front of the deep valley, began the contest near the camp, with discharges of cannon and musketry. At last the Russian army made a vigorous charge, and the army of the True Believers began to be anxious about their baggage and stores: in addition to this, a mixed crowd, composed of the Kazzak (i.e. Cos sack) and Shams Uddeen Lu tribes, who had been driven away from the vicinity of Teflis and had taken refuge in the Viceroy's camp, looking on the present event as a favourable opportunity, turned themselves to the plunder of his Highness's camp. The soldiers also, being quite panic-struck, fled towards the camp, with the intention of removing the stores and luggage, and afterwards of proceeding to the eastern side of the Fortress of Erivan. The prince, on beholding the disorder of his troops, had the bright expanse of his forehead indented with wrinkles, and wounded several of the fugitives with his lance; but as the hand of confusion had grasped the collar of the faint-hearted soldiery, nei ther force nor favour availed. The Russian army pursued them to Erivan, where they made a breach in an elevated mosque of that place, which had been left unguarded : they then threw up entrench ments on every side, and from the thunder of their artillery! and musketry the awful uproar of the Day of Judgment was exhibited in this world. TheDYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 201 people of the fort also, taking their posts in the bastions and curtains, were prepared for the assault, and discharged against the assailants their cannon, dreadful as dragons. The Prince Viceroy halted at the station of Sadrak, in Erivan, employing himself in collecting his forces: he also made representa tion of the state of affairs to the king of kings, exalted as Jamshid ; and from his anxiety to repair his losses, renew the battle, and relieve the people of the fort, denied himself the enjoyments of plea sure and relaxation of every description whatsoever. CHAP. XL11I. AN ACCOUNT OF THE MARCH OF THE CLIMATE-CONQUERING SOVE REIGN FROM SULTANIYAH TO ERIVAN, AND HIS MAJESTY'S COM BATS AGAINST THE RUSSIANS. Wren the account of this affair reached the Mi nisters of the celestial court at Sultaniyah, they instantly put in motion the fortunate standards, with the army then assembled at the triumphant stirrup ; and set out from that place, with the determination giving battle to the Russians. The neighing of horses, the sound of the war-trumpet, and the din of the fire-scattering camel-guns, hurled confusion mto the celestial sphere. Orders were given to the king's favourite relative, Ismail Beg of Damaghan, to advance at the head of forces raised by the brave men of Khorasan. In the course of a few c %s, his majesty having crossed the Aras, rendered, through his fortunate arrival, the Prince-Viceroy's cam P splendid as the expanse of heaven. After two days' halt in that place, the Prince Viceroy, in202 dynasty op the kajars. attendance upon his majesty, magnificent as Jam- shid, guarantied a favourable result of battle against the Russians; and the sovereign, with the splendor of Feridoon, having selected brave and experienced warriors, drew out his line in martial array. The prince moved on with the advance guard; whilst, following his highness, the fortunate monarch's standard reared its head to the skies. The thun ders of the foe-destroying zambooraks*, and the neighing of the steeds, swift as the wind, disturbed the pillars of fortune ; whilst the infantry and ca valry of the redoubted host, under the shadow of his majesty's victory-adorned standard, more rapid than the vernal clouds, advanced on the Russian entrenchments, pouring forth showers of poniards and sabres. They found the Russians, however, at their posts, prepared for battle and deadly strife. The round bullets soon made heads, like so many balls, to roll in the dust of the field of battle; and from the star-like musket-balls of the Russians, the bird of the soul of the great and illustrious winged its way from the cage of the body. From the numbers of the slain, there flowed a i ocean of blood over the wide plains; and the steeds of mountain-force, belong ing to the brave deceased, were wandering about in the purple tide, like ships without rudders; and the spirits of the brazen-bodied heroes were lamenting and wailing in the air. The uproar and loud cla mour raised by the warriors, vividly depicted the terror of the Day of Judgment on the earth. The royal army, with the rapidity of lightning, at once threw itself on the heptagonal entrenchments ot the * Camel-gun.dynasty of the kajars. 203 Russians, and was blended with them, like day and night, or light and darkness: the fortresses of the breast were torn open by the poniards of the brave, and the heads of the champions were rolling in dust and gore. The Russians in one place being driven from their entrenchments, death and destruction were scattered on the heads of that humiliated race. They had, however, taken possession of the lofty mosque, where they fortified themselves, and from whence they commenced hurling the death-bearing bullets. In short, the infantry and cavalry of the king, on that destructive day, displayed unbounded energy, and the battle raged until evening. The number of wounded and slain on both sides was considerable: many also were made prisoners in the dragon-binding lassos of the victorious cham pions of the Faith. When the monarch of mid-day marched in stately pomp from the expanse of hea ven to his western pavilions, the fortune-favoured troops of his unequalled majesty withdrew the hand from slaughter, and returned to their auspi cious encampment. CHAP. XL1V. an acc 0unt of his imperial majesty causing a body of in fantry to proceed to the fort of erivan. As the defenders of the Fortress of Erivan were chiefly Armenians, on whose efforts a thorough reliance could not be placed, on account of their immunity of faith with the Russians, and as Mu- larilln ed Khan had conveyed a similar representation l() the foot of the exalted throne, his foe-crushing204 dynasty of the kajars. majesty therefore ordered a detachment of expe rienced, gallant, and invincible veterans of the in fantry to guard the bastions and curtains of the fort. The Russians, in their fortifications and en trenchments, quietly looked on; while the victo rious troops at mid-day entered this strong fort on one side, being elevated by the gifts, praises, and approbation of his majesty ; and being received by the inhabitants with shouts of joy and glad accla mations, which ascended to the empyrean sphere. CHAP. XLV. AN ACCOUNT OF THE RUSSIANS MAKING A NIGHT ATTACK ON THE ROYAL CAMP ; OF THEIR ENGAGEMENT WITH THE IMPERIAL TROOPS ; AND OF THEIR DEFEAT AND FLIGHT INTO GURJISTAN. A t the hour of midnight, when the arrangement of the Pleiades had been violently dissevered through the oppression of the Ethiop hosts on the face of the jet-coloured throne, and the lofty firmament had adorned, like malignant Ahriman, its ears and neck with precious gems, the Russian troops moved from their camp, with many pieces of cannon, intending to make a night attack. On that gloomy night, the king, dignified as Saturn, had ordered Hasan Khan, the Yuz-bashi^ one of his body-guard, with a detachment of troops, to reconnoitre the vicinity of the Russian entrenchments. Hasan Khan, who was equally noted for sagacity and experience, dis covered their camp to be in motion; and as the Russians had no guides to the site of the triumphant camp, at their first setting out on this hazardous march they deviated from the proper direction, atdynasty of the kajars. 205 one time turning too much to the right, and at another to the left; whilst Hasan Khan, with a force composed of Ghoolams and intrepid cavalry, watched them closely, and endeavoured to ascertain their secret object. When the true dawn had displayed its bright standard on the roof of the dusky sky, the Russian army advanced towards the royal camp, and Hasan Khan immediately despatched a horse man to acquaint the Afrasiab-like monarch with the nature of their designs. The orthodox sovereign immediately ordered the fortune-favoured troops to mount. In this posture of affairs the Russian troops came to an eminence near the auspicious camp, where they halted for a short time; they then began to discharge their artillery, and maintained their ground with firm resolution. Such a manifes tation of their disposition displeased his majesty's high spirit; so that, on his side also, the victory- nourished troops becoming the assailants, made several bold attacks, and numbers of the Russians were wounded or slain through the assaults of the victorious troops. On this, the Russians, despond ing and hopeless, retired from the field of battle to their entrenchments ; and the army ot the 1 rue Believers also, in close pursuit of them, extended the arm of valour in the destruction of the foe. The sovereign possessed of Jamshid's signet, hav ing issued orders to his intrepid warriors to extirpate their antagonists, the terror-striking host surrounded the entrenchments, and intercepted all kinds of pro visions ; and whomsoever they found, either coming or going, they made pass under the edge of the206 dynasty of the kajars. merciless sword. Conformably to the royal orders, the troops were deprived of rest and repose, both day and night; the spy of slumber was banished from the sanctuary of the eye; whilst, according to the dictates of vigilance and attention, they continued at their posts and passes, prepared for battle and slaughter. All their intercourse with the world was so completely cut off, that the swift-travelling courier of the morning found it impossible to ap proach the place where this narrow-minded race were encamped. In the course ot these events, a considerable number of Georgian nobles, traders, and artificers of Teflis, and a number ot Russians, with much money and valuable effects, set out tor their own country. In the vicinity of Sunker, being met by the advanced picquets of the victorious army, under the command ot Aly Khan Kajar, Ph' Kuly Khan Kajar, and Aly Kuly Khan Shahun, they made arrangements to cut them oil. The musket-balls, on both sides, broke the backbones of the brave, and the bright-flashing spear conveyed the message of fate to the sides of the warriors. When several on each side had fallen on the field oi death, Aly Khan, Pir Kuly Khan, and Aly Kuly Khan, having charged on the right and left with their in trepid victory-crowned troops, seized them all in the lasso of captivity : their property, cattle, riches, and merchandize, fell to the conquerors,who brought them to the royal presence as captives, bound hand and neck in the ensnaring noose. The area of the royal camp, from the splendor of the angelic features of Gurj and Rus (i .e. Georgians and Russians), excitedDYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 207 the envy of the azure expanse of heaven. From among these the victorious monarch selected a num ber of the tress-perfumed, slender-waisted youths, and conferred on them the distinguished rank of en rolment in his personal train. A considerable body, however, of that ill-fated race had taken post in a strong castle in the district of Pambak, and received supplies from Gurjistan, which they afterwards intro duced into the Russian camp. His majesty there fore ordered Pir Kuly Khan^ with a body of brave, foe-crushing warriors, to attack that castle. This brave commander, with his ever-successful cham pions, fell on the fort like an unexpected calamity; and the inhabitants and the Russians contrived to despatch information of their situation to the hostile Ashpukhdar, entreating him at the same time to send them speedy assistance. On hearing this in telligence, he became agitated with distress, like wild-rue thrown on fire : he summoned the flower of his forces, and selected from among them a body of infantry, called Yagers, whose quick hands are like devouring fire, and whose hearts are as stable as the globe, and are celebrated throughout the whole of their army for their rapid movements and energy. With these he sent some pieces of cannon, and gave them orders to convey stores and reinforcements to the inhabitants of Pambak. His exalted majesty, on the other side, also ordered Aly Kuly Khan Shahun to prevent this. Whilst on their march, a horseman pushed forward to Pir Kuly Khan, in formed him of the Russian movement, and con certed that Pir Kuly Khan should also, on his part.208 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. display the standard of battle and contest: in short, both these commanders hastened in front and rear, and found the Russians between Pambak and Erivan; so that, having thus enclosed them, like game, on all sides, the flame of contest mounted aloft, and the high heavens were enveloped in the smoke of artillery and musketry. Although the hopes of the Russians were cut off in every direction, they still resolutely kept their ground, and maintained a dreadful fire. Lightnings and thunders proceeded from all their movements: the vault of the suspended skies and the graduated fir mament were filled with smoke. The army of the True Believers made a general charge, and be came confounded with the Russians; and they clung to each other like enraged hornets. The edge of the head-scattering sword produced a deluge of blood, overspreading the world; and in one instant the series of their compact arrangement was broken asunder: in short, not a single person of that in fatuated race escaped, except those who were made prisoners ; and the army of the True Believers, crowned with complete success, by the aid of Pro vidence, returned to the camp revolving like the heavens; after which they raised, opposite the royal pavilion, a pile equal to it in height, composed of the heads of Russian officers and soldiers; and Pir Kuly Khan, having brought with him a piece of cannon and a flag taken by the brave champions of his own regiments, received from the climate- conquering sovereign a donation of a thousand Tomans. When the account of this great defeatdynasty of the kajars. 209 reached Ashpukhdar, his heart's blood flowed ra pidly to his pallid cheek, and the fire of grief blazed intensely through the window of his breast, as nearly 4000 men of his army had been slain or taken prisoners by the hands of the foe-capturing lions of battle. In the beginning of Rabi-us-sany he de parted from the Fort of Erivan to Ashk ; and, with burning sighs, from thence proceeded to Teflis; while the advance pickets of the victorious army followed him closely, and took much booty and many prisoners. Muhammed Khan Kajar, governor of Erivan, Khleb Aly Khan Kunker Lu, and the other inhabitants of Erivan, who had been closely pressed by the Russian blockade, being now deli vered by the developement of the royal energies and the dignified measures adopted by the king, from a distressing siege, and from the destructive fire of the guns and mortars of this vile race, now turned the face of supplication to his majesty's court (the source of honour), and rubbed their fore heads in the dust of the equity-based threshold; and having thus exhibited their complete devoted- ness and zeal, they became acceptable in the sight of the victorious monarch, and obtained the honour of distinction by the receipt of the royal munificence and notice. Muhammed Khan's son, who was in personal attendance on the munificent sovereign, was permitted to depart from the Durbar (the resort of the world), and Muhammed Khan was re-instated in the government. The district of Nakhshiwan, w ith the tribe of Kunker Lu, was bestowed on Khleb Aly Khan ; and both these commanders were p210 dynasty of the kajars. graciously suffered to depart. As the season ol campaigning had now terminated, and that oi de struction to the vine-leaf had arrived, the wide- ruling monarch turned his face to the seat of empire; and the world-embellishing retinue, pro ceeding by way of imperial Tabreez, diffused musk- scented gales in the direction ol Teheran, and on the 14th of Rejeb arrived at the centre of monarchy.

On the arrival of Hajy Khaleel Khan in Bombay, Lord Wellesley, the English sovereign's Vizir^ in order to shew him honour and respect, appointed 200 Hindoo soldiers to be stationed near him. It happened that one of these soldiers had improperly, and contrary to rule, dis charged his musket, and thereby rendered himself liable to punishment*.

Hajy Khaleel Khan came out to examine into the affair; and as they did not understand each other, it was imagined that he came from motives of par tiality: another musket was therefore discharged, and Hajy Khaleel was killed on the spot. Such was the decree of overpowering fate, that an Ambas sador, who had set out on his destination with such complete honour and distinction, should, without any reasonable cause, perish on the road ! On this, Lord Wellesley, the English Vizir f, sent for Mr. Manestie the Consul at Bussorah, and despatched him from the port of Bushe^ir for the purpose of apo logizing to his imperial majesty. He obtained the honour of an interview in Sultaniyah, and was dis tinguished by the royal munificence. Muhammed Nebby Khan, sister's J son to the deceased lichee, was next appointed to the office; and he set out on his destination, perfectly equipped and provided with all that was requisite.

In the excess of their friendship and kindness, they invited him one day to behold a review of the army; an other day, to visit the arsenal: and they carried their attention so far, as to shew him the mode of naval war, and in order that he might witness and fully comprehend the manner in which cannon-balls set a wooden building or a ship on fire. Muhammed Nebby Khan heedlessly assented to attend, alto gether forgetting that a great sum must be ex pended in the experiment.

N asir ud-deen T orah was the younger brother of Mir Haidar, son of Shah Murad, who was styled Beggy Jan : he was the son of Damyal Atabeg, son of Hakim Atabeg. As his ancestors held the office of Atabegee under the dynasty of Jengheez, they were for this reason styled ' Atabeg.' The word Torah, in the Turkish language, means ' rule,' ' manner,' or 'mode:' the Yasa Nameh of Jengheez is also called by this appellation. At present, this word, in the universal acceptation of the people of Ma war- un-nahr, means 'Prince;' and as Nasir ud-deen and Mir Haidar, on the mother's side, are grandsons to Abul Farz Khan, who is related to Jengheez, they are therefore styled ' Torah,' and mentioned under this appellation. Their origin is derived from Uzbeg Khan, grandson to Jujy Khan, When the holy Mir, entitled Beggy Jan (known by the name of Waly-ul-Niamet, and called Shah Murad), be came Prince of Mawar-un-nahr after his father, he committed all kinds of devastation in Merv and Khorasan. Pir Mually Khan Kajar several times sent an army against him, and often came in person to the borders of Merv ; but being at last slain, the c ity of Merv fell into the hands of Beggy Jan. He214 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. took all the inhabitants captive, and carried them away to Bokhara, where he delivered them over to every kind of suffering and affliction: he also broke down the bund or dam of Merv, and totally de stroyed the city through want of water. Hajy Mu- hammed Hasan Khan, the eldest son of Pir Mually Khan, hastened to the imperial court, where he was distinguished by favours and gracious atten tions. In consideration of his virtues and accom plishments, he attained to the dignity of familiar intercourse in the service of the unequalled sove reign. In the course of these events, Beggy Jan set out on the road to eternity; and his elder son, Mir Haidar, assumed the sovereign power in his tyran nical father's place. The Nobet* of his govern ment sounded loud in the cities of Mawar-un-nahr. As his nature was prone to bloodshed and persecu tion, like his evil-disposed father's, he was alike pre cipitate in destroying individuals, and bringing ruin upon their families: for this reason, the inclinations of the nobles of Bokhara were alienated, and they became alarmed through his misgovernment; and the whole of the cultivators daily addressed prayers to the Durbar of the Almighty, to confound his state. In order to reform his affairs, he sum moned Nasir ud-deen Torah from Merv, the capital, to Bokhara: from motives of hypocrisy and trea chery, he gave him various counsels and exhorta tions ; but the unmeaning words of this senseless man, made, on the ears of Nasir ud-deen, as little impression as the buzzing of flies; for he deigned * Nobet, 'official drums.'DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. not to listen to these words, but sent back his Envoy with Letters breathing the bitterness of hostility. He found his only remedy to consist in an appeal to the imperial court; therefore the dovef of his sincerity and inclination chose to fix herself on the roof of the Saturn-like palace of the sove reign dignified as heaven. Having sent humble representations to the court, this firman, effica cious as that of Destiny, agreeably to his request, was issued forth : ' Whereas Nasir ud-deen Torah ' has entreated from the presence, aid and assist- ' ance, and has directed his eyes to the royal road ' of our esteem: this fortunate Nawab is to us in ' the light of a son : and shortly, by the favour of ' the Almighty, he shall be blessed with the society ' of the bride of happiness.' Peremptory despatches were also issued forth, with all honour, from the source of splendor and glory, to the armlet of the arm of prosperity, Waly Mirza, ruler of the regions of Khorasan, to this purport; ' Whereas the Prince ' of Turkistan has been obliged to flee from his ' brother, Mir Haidar Torah, and knocks with the ' f hand of supplication at the door of this fortunate ' son's boundless beneficence: therefore, in every ' case^ attention to the interests of this high-born ' prince is an incumbent duty.

The area of the audience-hall, from the abundance of gold and silver coins, conveyed re proaches to the gold-shedding branches of the flowers. The sovereign's audience-chamber, from the accumulated treasures and piled-up rubies, resembled the courts of Heaven, replete with pearls of inestimable price. When the festival of the auspicious Nurooz was terminated, the rays of royal benevolence were directed towards the important concerns of temporal and spiritual affairs. In the course of this occupation, the particulars of the total ruin of Muhammed Khan Afghan were con veyed to the foot of the exalted throne; of which the following is a summary account:—Muhammed Khan was the son of Aazem Khan Afghan Alija; which race, impelled by an ungrateful disposition, has always led a wandering life. The father, Aazem Khan, about the reign of Ahmed Shah Afghan Durrany, left Kandahar on account of some dispute between the tribes of Alija and Abdaly, and joined Kereem Khan Zend with a body of his fol lowers. Kereem Khan assigned them a settlement in Nermasheer, in Kerman; in which territory this family gradually gained supreme power, and built a strong castle. On the accession of this present exalted dynasty, when Kerman (the seat of secu- nty), with all the dependencies of that region, were committed to his royal highness, the prop of the State, Ibrahim Khan, his majesty's cousin, although Muhammed Khan was the fruit of the tree of hy pocrisy and dissimulation, he, notwithstanding this, hastened to court, and participated in the favours218 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. of the equitable sovereign. The district of Nerma- sheer was also graciously conferred on him, on the same conditions as before ; but, on his arrival there, he turned away from the path ol obedience to his benefactor. At this period, a great scarcity and dearth prevailed in that country; therefore, pur suant to the royal orders, corn and grain, from Shiraz, Isfahan, Yezd, and Kashan, were com manded to be conveyed there on strong camels backs, but not even a single ear of corn could be procured t consequently, the equipment oi the arm) became impossible: for this reason Muhammed Khan, in the beginning of the insurrection, wished to get possession of Bam by force. The Nuwab Ibrahim Khan having deemed it most important in the first place to guard the Fort of Bam, despatched for its defence Ismail Khan Arab, governor of Jan- daky, one of those pure, high-minded spirits which were always attached to the Government bright as Paradise : in the second place, by regular reports, he fully communicated to his exalted majesty the account of Muhammed Khan s hostile proceedings. In consequence of this intelligence, Nurooz Khan Kajar Uz ud-deen Lu, high chamberlain, and master of the audience-hall, proceeded from the seat ot royalty with a body of intrepid, foe-crushing war riors, moving with the rapidity of the decrees of Destiny. When Muhammed Khan heard of Nurooz Khan's advance, he conveyed all his property int 0 the Fort of Nermasheer; and the fortress-capturing host of the solar-throned monarch having invested his strong hold, severe battles took place betweenDYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 210 them, during several days. At last, having made a general assault on every side, they captured the fort, and great numbers fell under the swords of the intrepid, lion-hunting troops. Muhammed Khan, who had received two severe wounds during the assault, being now obliged to have recourse to the path of flight, contrived, though half dead and wholly exhausted, to extricate himself with some of his Afghans, and fled in the direction of Baluchistan: the remainder of his companions, whether Afghans or natives of Sistan, wherever they fell in with the royal troops, fierce as Mars, were exposed to the edge of the merciless sword. After this, Nurooz Khan, with his victorious troops, having triumphed by the aid of Heaven, returned to the court dignified as Saturn's. CHAP. XLIX. AN ACCOUNT OF THE PRINCE VICEROY OF TEMPORAL AND SPIRITUAL POWER BEING ORDERED TO PROCEED TO AZARBA'UAN. HIS BATTLE WITH THE RUSSIANS. T he preceding year it had been contemplated by the all-pervading sight of the world-subduing mon arch, efficacious as the solar energy, on his re turn from Erivan, to leave the Prince Viceroy in the seat of the Khalifat and the abode of regal authority, and that he himself would expose his precious existence to encounter the Russians of Granjah and Gurjistan. At the time of making pre parations for the expedition to Azarba'ijan, the Prince Viceroy, on beholding this circumstance, exhibited in his sun-like features the traces of affliction; his eyes were filled with tears, and in a220 dynasty of the kajars. supplicating manner he frequently represented to the heaven-aided sovereign this earnest entreaty—' That ' the conduct of the war against the Russians, and ' the renewal of the expedition to Erivan, might ' be entrusted to the zeal and activity of him the ' prince, the humblest and the most profoundly- ' devoted of his majesty's servants.' As the re gion-conquering sovereign imagined that the tri umphant prince, through the impulse of youthful ardour and the ambition of command, had admit ted into his head prospects of delight from this ex pedition, therefore, through perfect sympathy, he refused this request, but gave him the following per mission : ' That at the period of putting in motion ' the world-subduing standard, and during his resi- ' dence in Teheran, the seat of Government, when- ' ever he might feel disposed to set out on an expe- ' dition, he might repair to the territory of Luristan, ' and occupy himself in the pleasures of the chase.' The Prince Viceroy, endued with the high energy ot the royal falcon*, the pursuer of the celestial eagles, was anxious to expand his wings in the atmosphere of victory; and the influence of the fortunate star ot his happy mind ever prompted him to splendid en terprise and deeds of high renown, and consequently was not content with this unimportant concession. ' How can that energy which soars to heaven content itselt with mean employment ? '* Or how can the favourite of the bridal chamber of ambition stoop its neck to trifling occupation.' * The hawk which is trained to fly at the eagle is nearly the smallest of the whole tribe of the hawks fit for the chace, and 1= called shake en, i. e. royal.DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 221 The Prince Viceroy therefore again requested that the march of the royal train, distinguished by vic tory, should be countermanded ; and pledged him self to bring to a successful issue the expedition to Azarba'ijan and the Russian war. The climate- subduing monarch, in order to tranquillize the youthful hero's mind, deigned to grant his request, and submitted the expedition to Azarba'ijan to his command. When the Prince Viceroy's train had moved, and reflected splendor on the station out side the citadel of Teheran, the sovereign^ charac terized by kindness, bestowed the honour of a visit on his exalted son's encampment. On the follow ing day, the Prince Viceroy, with a company of Ameers and Nobles, who had been ordered to at tend his highness's train to Azarba'ijan, set out for that region. Mirza Isa, styled Mirza Buzurg, who the year before had been appointed superintendant of the affairs of the capital, and who, like the new moon, had been separated from the sun of the royal presence, was, by orders of his sovereign, the pos sessor of the crown and diadem, attached to the train of the prince of exalted mind, on this expedition. Notwithstanding the conducting of this expedition had been entrusted to the distinguished and powerful prince's acute sagacity, yet his sublime majesty, for the purpose of being near at hand, and to assist his noble son if necessary, under pretence of hunting and taking recreation in the delightful plains of Azarba'ijan, set out, and on the 24th of Safar-ul- Nuzaffar pitched the gorgeous pavilion of royal splendor in the Plains of Sultaniyah ; from whence, after a few days' halt, he raised the standard, ever222 dynasty of the kajars. distinguished by victory, in the direction ot Azat- ba'ijan. At the time of moving the world-subduing standard, his majesty ordered Ismail Beg, the fa- vourite, a confidential Ghoolam oi the court (the asylum of the world), who was distinguished for his great promptitude and celebrated for his abundant sagacity, accompanied by a body of warriors ever foremost in the lists of victory, heedless of danger in the plains of strife and battle, to join the Prince Viceroy, and to pay implicit obedience to his realm- adorning wisdom, powerful as the decrees of Destiny. When the world-subduing train moved from Serab, orders were given to Prince Aly Khan, the victorious Viceroy's brother, to halt at Zanjan, at the station of Meanah; and pursuant to the royal resolution, Mahdy Kuly Khan Kajar was ordered by the Vice roy to Erivan, with a detachment of the ever- victorious troops. It was also settled. That if Mu ' hammed Khan should break off his engagements ' previously formed with the Russians and Jaafer ' Kuly Khan, and return again to his allegiance « and friendly sentiments, the prince should in that ' case maintain and uphold his authority: but in ' the opposite case, he should deprive him of the ' government and revenues of the province; anc ' that the prince should assume the supreme autho- ' rity, and devote himself to arranging the affaire ' of it, and establishing his power therein.'

AN ACCOUNT OF THE HOSTILITY OP IBRAHIM KHALIL KHAN OF KARABAGH. A BATTLE IS FOUGHT, BY ORDER OF THE PRINCE VICEROY, BY ISMAIL BEG, HIS MAJESTY'S FAVOURITE, AGAINST THE TROOPS OF KARABAGH ; AND THE SUBSEQUENT ADVANCE OF THE VICTORIOUS STANDARD IN THAT DIRECTION. When this Destiny-like decree had the honour of issuing forth from the source of distinction and splendor—' Let the peerless prince cross the River ' Aras, and scatter the surface of the earth, by his ' dust-exciting, camel-bodied, desert-traversing ca- ' valry, to the winds: and as for Ibrahim Khalil ' Khan Juwan Shir, who has seated himself on the ' rock of pride, and has permitted the raven of haughtiness to deposit her eggs in the nest of his ' brain, and puffs himself up with the contempla- ' tion of the strength of his fortress, let him be u made to drink deep of the cup of authority, and ' swallow the overpowering poison of affliction. ' But if, from folly and perversity, he again turn ' away from the Ministers of our powerful State, ' and mount the charger of folly, and ride off and ' demand assistance from the Russians, make all ' re quisite arrangements for battles and hostilities u m those districts, and let the thunders of musket- balls, with the meteors of the arrow and the sabre, be poured and heaped upon that handful [' ^ degraded and infatuated rebels.' The prince, ln accordance to this world-pervading command, displayed the tresses of the victory-embellished banners in the direction of Azarba'ijan, and moved way of Ahar on Karabagh. Before he had224 dynasty op the kajars. crossed the River Aras, Ibrahim Khalil Khan, on learning the advance of the victorious retinue, raised his head in hostility; but, through the ascendancy of terror and alarm, he retired into the Fort of Pana- habad, where the image of punishment and stupor firmly grasped the collar of his soul. Still, how ever, he sent Jaafer Kuly Beg, son to Muhammed Husain Khan (who was his son), along with the son of Fazl Aly Beg Juwan Shir, to Ganjah, in order to maintain the Bridge of Khoda Afreen. The impla cable Ashpukhdar also despatched a considerable force of soldiers to guard this bridge, and engage in battle, if necessary, with the ever-victorious troops ; and, through extreme rashness and fearless ness, he even followed in person, determined on battle, and prepared for the encounter. On the arrival of this great reinforcement, Ibrahim Khan, having attached a body of cavalry and infantry from Karabagh to his son, Muhammed Husain Khan, ad vanced, in concert with the Russians, to guard the bridge, and give battle to the army of the True Be lievers. The Prince Viceroy drew up his forces in front of the Castle of Ahar; sending in advance his majesty's favourite, Ismail Beg, with a detachment ot enemy-chasing, foe-subduing warriors ; when, after their departure, he learned, the same evening, the march of the Russians to the Bridge of Khoda Afreen. The prince now reflected on the Russians encoun tering Ismail Beg, and the possibility of his sustaining a serious loss and considerable defeat: his highness therefore could no longer brook delay until morning, but set out to join him that same instant. The way from Ahar to the River Aras abounds withDYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 225 deep valleys, lofty mountains, and steep hills, so that e\en in daylight it is nearly impossible to traverse it, jet the prince on that gloomy night, when the cm tain of daikness had enveloped the world, from excess of zeal easily passed over that space with his troops and baggage, and arrived the following day, at noon, on the bank of the Aras. In the mean time, Ismail Beg and his rapidly-moving warriors, having left the Aras in their rear, met their ill-fated oppo^ nent at four parasangs from Pul Khoda Afreen, and immediately prepared for battle. The enemy on all sides became the butt against which their arrows and bullets were fired, in such numbers, that the wide world was rendered dark and straitened before their short-sighted eyes: every flash of lightning that blazed from the cloud-like musket burned up some tall date-tree with its destructive flame; and every arrow shot forth from the tongue of the serpent, against the foe, tore some gallant warrior from his saddle: in the field of battle the edge of the sword I transformed the white water-lily into a scarlet tulip ; and through the blood of the slaughtered the gravel of the plain resembled in colour a floor strewed with cornelian and coral. In the army of the Faithful, their hearts were burning with rage, and their souls aming wrath: the brave warriors of Roos and arabagh, with habitual resolution and hostility, disdained the disgrace of flight from the foe; so that e aioa of contest at last became so contracted to he combatants on both sides, that universal despon- once seized every breast. Ismail Beg, on behold- ln g this posture of affairs, through extreme high 'P'nt and thirst of distinction and fame, poured Q226 dynasty op the kajars. from the onyx of his eyes pearl-coloured tears, while the fire of ardent indignation blazed from the furnace of his heart: he every instant executed gallant charges, and displayed the most manly exertions; notwithstanding which, the soldiers of the Faith had nearly received a severe defeat i but at that instant the victory-distinguished retinue of the Prince Vice roy appeared at a distance; the sky-traversing clouds of dust raised by the army of the Faith, effi cacious to the eyes as antimony, excited the famed and celebrated champions, and became a precious collyrium to the sight. The heart of Ismail Beg and the other warriors, whose hearts began to waver, became strengthened by the appearance of the lion- hearted prince, and new life entered their bodies through the favourable prophecies of their souls. When the Russians and the forces of Karabagh be held the standard of their fortunes lowered, and the load-star of their fate pointing to the valley of death and destruction, those who escaped from the edge of the sword fled from the field of battle, and at last, through difficult passes and wooded mountains, after innumerable reverses, arrived at the Fort ot Panahabad, or Sheshah. The Prince Viceroy sent to the court, exalted as heaven, the heads ot the fallen Russians and their allies; and advanced, in pursuit of the flying enemy, towards that fort which is the source of the corruption of this innately-de praved race.dynastv of the kajars. 227 CHAP.

T he Prince Viceroy, with his army, rapid as light ning, strong as mountains, instantly pursued the enemy, and kept up the pursuit as far as the station of Ak Aghlan. In the course of their route, the chiefs of the tribes and clans of Karabadi, having O 7 O been honoured by the Prince Viceroy's dignified pre sence, and being sensible of the abundant advantages resulting from it, and his boundless beneficence, obtained permission to return. Najuf Kuly Khan Karus, one of the most distinguished chieftains, was appointed to guard Ak Aghlan, where the jungle of Karabagh commences. From thence the eagle- standard soared aloft by way of Chunakchy, the most difficult of roads, thick set with steep hills, abrupt declivities, and mountains. In the station of Chunakchy they suffered the cattle of the gunners graze, which had become as attenuated as the locks of the slender-waisted beauties. Then the ^re-dealing infantry were put in motion, like the western breezes; and the world-consuming cavalry were ordered to the rear : in this array was the for midable host drawn up, and with such admirable e ffect, that the curve-backed ancient of the sky ('• e. the sun) broke out into loud exclamations of bonder and praise. In this order they advanced to the Fort of Panahabad; and on the day of their q 2228 dynasty of the kajars. arrival outside the fortress, patience departed from the hearts and energy from the hands of the Moslem and Christian associates of Ibrahim Kuly Khan: they became like people distracted and des titute of resources. At this moment there came from one side the intelligence, diffusing joy among the army, of the arrival of the mighty sovereign's heaven-like revolving camp to the station of 1 akht- i-Ta'us, seven parasangs from the Fort of Panaha- bad : from another side, the joy-bestowing tidings of the approach of Kurakeen, the Russian Bulkuneck general, gladdened the Prince Viceroy's soul, and that of the lion-chasing champions of the Faith. The Russian Bulkuneck commandant, with two other celebrated officers, at the head of a conside rable force, a park of artillery, military stores, and 200 carriages laden with arms and effects, filled with provisions and abundance of clothing, with numbei- less necessaries and equipments, had come fiom Ganjah, as agreed upon with Ibrahim Khalil Khan, to engage and oppose the army of the Faith an protect the Fort of Panahabad, and were now arnved at Askeran. Both these events were communicated to the Prince Viceroy at the moment the tram, nu merous as the stars, invested the Fort of Panaha bad. Before the ever-victorious troops could repose an instant from the fatigues of the march, or remain a moment in their tents to refresh their horses an give repose to the cattle, the Prince Viceroy, with out hesitation or pause, mounted his charger, rapi as the wind, with the fixed purpose of giving batt e and attaining distinguished fame. Unfurling t ie standard of holy war and sacred heroism, heDYNASTY OP THE KAJARS. 2^9 drew out his line and marshalled his thousands. His majesty's favoured servant, Ismail Beg, the cham pion of the ever-victorious army, and Pir Kuly Khan Kajar, were appointed to command the infantry, the model of rapid evolutions: Muhammed Aly Khan Kajar, Aly Khan Ka An Lu Kajar, and Sadik Khan Uz uddeen Lu Kajar, were constituted commanders oi the heroic cavalry : the main body was entrusted to the zeal of Mahdy Kuly Khan Kajar: orders were given to the musketeers of Ferahani and Guzazi, commanded by Allah Verdy Khan Kajar, to take post on the face of the eminence which overlooked the Russian army; while the Prince Viceroy stationed himself in the centre, like the radiant sun in the heaven. In short, three hours after sun-rise, the armies encountered each other in the vicinity of Askeran ; with eager desire they mutually displayed the standard of war and contest in the midst of the field of battle: altogether heed less of safety, they threw themselves, like salaman ders or moths, into the fierce and intense flames excited by their thunder-voiced guns. On both sides the intrepid and heroic combatants maintained the hot exchange of deadly strife: from the loud din of trumpets and drums, blended with the roar- ln g of guns and swivels, the appalling terrors of the % of Judgment were exhibited to the inhabitants this world. The winged arrow and cutting poniard passed the steel-clad breasts and bosoms of the champions, as easily as the soft and swift arrows ^ot from haughty beauties pass through hapless lovers' hearts. Kurakeen Bulkuneck maintained, with undaunted resolution the foot of firmness and230 dynasty of the kajars. stability in the lists of bravery, while the wrinkles of hostility furrowed his brow. The Prince Vice roy's army, in opposition to the barrier of the Russian line, carried off the ball of determined re solution from the deep-rooted mountain to their own side • Until the time that the monarch of the stars descended from the azure steed ol the heavens, and prepared to enter his pavilions in the west, the lightnings of cannon and musketry on both sides burned up the harvest of the existence of the brave; and the collision of the ponderous cannon-balls struck fire from the hardest rocks. The fierce cro codiles of the ocean of energy, particularly Fir Kuly Khan, Muhammed Aly Khan, and Sadik Khan Kajar, performed such valiant deeds, that the tale of Asfendiar s seven stations is effaced from the re collection of time : they charged with such boldness, and displayed such heroic prowess, that Sam Nan- man's soul would have poured out encomiums on them. Amidst the alternations of the contest and the heat of battle, Sadik Khan Kajar received a severe wound from a fire-vomiting gun. At last the distinguished warriors of the ever-victorious army, from the right and left, like an overwhelming torrent, by order of the Prince Viceroy, made a general charge on foot. The Bulkuneck and the Russian warriors, unable to support this assault o the foe-subduing troops, fled; and withdrew to an extensive burying-ground, which contained some strong defences. In this place they collected on their flanks the rock-convulsing wheel carriages, * This is an allusion to a game prevalent in Persia, 11 very differently to that of golf in Scotland.dynasty of the kajars. 231 moving like spheres; and having made a foss out side them, piled up clay and stones at their back, while they themselves, sitting like flames amidst their thunder-voiced guns, every moment hurled ponderous bullets against the prince's army. On beholding this state of affairs, the Prince Viceroy ordered the musketeers of Guzazi and Ferahan, who had taken post on the eminence, and the rest of the army, to throw up entrenchments alongside of them; so that with the fire of the dragon-bodied cannon, and the flames of the loud-thundering zambooraks, they should open the gates of hell before their foes. As soon as the intelligence of the Russians being besieged in that strong position was represented to the residents of the emperor's celestial court, they detached to the aid of the camp, distinguished by victory, Husain Kuly Khan Kajar, with four pieces ot world-confounding cannon and ammunition ; also a body of Damaghanees, who are wont, in time of action, to sport with heads, and make them fly about the field of battle. Immediately on the arrival of the artillery, the prince of high destiny commanded them to commence battering the entrenchments of the Russians. Every morning, during six days, as sooi i as the globe of the radiant sun, impelled by the blows of the chukan of Destiny, began to re- volve in the azure firmament, the Russian heads ro ned about like balls, in dust and blood, from the collision of musket and cannon bullets. The s |aughtered Russians, and the carcases of the cattle tle y had brought with them for their carriages, ^ c ie heaped on each other like mounds; so that K ' of the world-cherishing sun, darting on232 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. these lifeless bodies, produced such a stench as bursts forth on opening the gates of the lowest abyss of hell. In short, on the night of Wednesday, the 12th of Rabi-us-sani, when gore-swallowing Mars un sheathed his diamond-studded sword to repel the enemies of the manifest Faith, and high-dwelling Saturn, who stands on the roof of the se\ enth empy rean portico, sharpened his blood-dropping poniard, the orthodox champions, the perfection of energy, by order of the glorious and powerful prince, with no other shields than their brave breasts, made a simultaneous assault on the ramparts and defences of their enemies ; and by the energetic influence ot their incomparable leader, and the never-failing e - ficacy of their admirable sovereign's high fortune, the Russian entrenchments were carried, and the flashing sword, bright as a mirror, the water ot which is consuming as fire*, was well exercised on a handful of contemptible wretches: many ot the officers and soldiers posted in these entrenchments were taken prisoners, and all their money and cattle became the property of the victorious champions o the Faith.

The Prince Viceroy, who is the perfection of innate mercy, granted his request; and the army, relying on the sincerity of the request, practised laxity and negligence in the duties of the blockade; so that the faithless covenant-breaker, taking ad vantage thereof, fled unexpectedly on the third night. As soon as the victorious champions of the Faith received intelligence of his flight, they in stantly pursued him, and caused several of his fel low-travellers, by the stroke of their well-tempered swords, to journey to the abode of destruction : the Bulkuneck, however, reached Mount Jamarak, the head of which soars in elevated majesty beyond the azure sky, and which serves as an asylum and pro tection to many rebel Armenians from Karabagh. There he dragged to the shore of safety the shat tered plank of his existence, which had been assailed the stormy tempest of war. About this time in- tormation was received that Ashpukhdar, for the purpose of assisting the Bulkuneck, had moved with his whole force from Ganjah, and had halted on the River Tatar : the Prince Viceroy therefore detached Ismail Beg, with a body of the brave and ever-victo- nous troops, to learn the number and description the Russian force in that quarter. In the course234 dynasty of the kajars. of their march, Ismail Beg and his intrepid warriors fell in with a force of infantry and cavalry belonging to the Russians : they joined in battle; when Ismail Beg and his heaven-aided followers slew many of the Russians, and returned to the prince's camp with some prisoners. On this, alarm and terror overpowered the imprudent Ashpukhdar: he moved not a single step from his post. It w T as however the prince's secret intention to draw him out, so that he might, in the field of battle, bring ruin on his fortunes. At the moment of these memorable actions, the triumphant sovereign's standard, like the bird of Paradise, was expanding its wings in the station of Takht-i-Ta'us: and when the news ot these important advantages reached the royal camp, his exalted majesty caused the Prince Viceroy, and the other chiefs of the army, to partake ot his libe rality and favours ; so that, through his munificent donations and liberality, the crowns ot their heads became exalted in glory to the seventh sphere.

Some of these troops were slain, and those who escaped the slaughter fled and turned back; and Muhammed Khan, through the loyalty and devoted- ness of the Kajar tribe and the other inhabitants of Erivan, was not able to deliver the fortress, as he intended, into the hands of the Russians. An order was therefore issued, that Mahdy Kuly Khan should observe Muhammed Khan, and that he himself was to attend to the administration of affairs. The vic torious sovereign also commanded Ashraf Khan Damavendy, with the musketeers of Damavend, German, and Teheran, to garrison the fort. At this conjuncture, news having reached the Ministers of the court, the centre of the world, that Shufat had moved in the direction of Gilan (the seat of agri culture), orders were therefore given to Mirza Yusuf, the chief secretary, to set out with a force of mtrepid warriors, and co-operate with Mirza Musa, the Munajjcm Bashy, in guarding the boundaries ail d passes of the country.23(3 DYNASTY OP THE KAJARS. CHAP. LIU. THE REGION-CONQUERINQ SOVEREIGN ORDERS THE PRINCE VICEROY TO PROCEED TOWARDS GANJAH AND GURJISTAN. THE PRINCE OBLIGES THE RAYAS OF GANJAH TO EMIGRATE: ALSO AN AC COUNT OF WHAT PASSED IN THAT COUNTRY. The climate-subduing sovereign, while in the halt ing-place of Takht-i-Ta'us, commanded the Vicege rent of temporal and spiritual power. Prince Abbas Mirza, to advance in the direction of Ganjah; and Ismail Beg was ordered, with a considerable force, to terminate the affair of Ashpukhdar. The prince therefore, with the ever-victorious troops, departing from the station of Askeran, directed his course to Ganjah ; and the dust raised by the retinue, splen did as the stars, became collyrium to the eyes ot the brilliant heavenly bodies. It so happened, that the inveterate Ashpukhdar, who had moved from Ganjah with complete equipments and stores to encounter the army of the Faithful, on observing the colours of the army on the banks of the River Tatar, on reflecting on their deeds, and viewing their disposition, was seized with a terror so bound less, that he fled, and retired to the Mountain ot Ak Darah, the roads to which are most difficult ot access ; and there, bat-like, he crept into the valleys of the country, to seclude himself from the sigbt ot the radiant sun. The Prince Viceroy not having orders or permission to follow him, which would have caused some delay, regarded his worthless existence as utterly unimportant, and thereroic moved his standard in the direction of his principal object; and in the course of his march captureddynasty of the kajars. 237 the town of Ganjah*, where he slew, and took pri soners, many Russians. Thus accompanied by good fortune and success, he halted outside the city, and appointed a body of troops, irresistible as the De luge, to besiege the fort. The force employed to effect this object had now reduced the besieged to great straits, when a report, which, like the false dawn, was perfectly devoid of the light of truth, was spread among the Moslems of Ganjah; namely, that the victory-ennobled camp, by order of the Prince Viceroy, was in the act of breaking up : this un founded rumour being circulated among them from one to another, suddenly, high and low, young and old, men and women, rushed out of the city in dis traction and perplexity, and proceeded to the camp : the troops, also, which had been appointed to be siege the castle, on hearing this tumult and uproar, began to entertain absurd thoughts ; and, following the population of the city, returned in like manner to the camp. Although such conduct was repug nant to the prince's unerring reason, and was quite opposed to his magnanimous nature, yet, as provi sions were abundant in the castle, and the Russians had therefore the means of holding out and main taining themselves as well as of exciting wickedness and alarm, and as it was impossible to get provisions The way the capture of Ganjah is spoken of, is something e Cowley's verse: ' But when Isabella came, ' Arm'd with a resistless flame, ' And th' artillery of her eye; ' Whilst she proudly march'd about, ' Greater conquests to find out, ' She beat out Susan by-the-bye.'238 dynasty of the kajars. for the army outside the fort, so for these reasons the generous prince, without having recourse to reproof or inculpation of the troops or rayas, mounted the people of the city on the cattle of his own royal stable, and on the mules and camel-trains of the Government and the horses of the army. All the baggage and heavy stores were then sent off, in ad vance of the exalted retinue, to Shamkur, which is four parasangs from Ganjah; the Prince Viceroy, with a considerable detachment of the victorious army, remained in the rear, and halted that night two parasangs from Ganjah. When the Russians learned that the prince had halted in that district, they conceived the absurd idea, that, by exciting alarm and rekindling the fire of battle, they could draw from his position the high-fortuned prince, who, like some firmly-based mountain, had planted the foot of stability and constancy under the skirt oi the mantle of permanency. For this purpose, there fore, from the beginning of night until the true dawn appeared, they rendered the surface of the world as bright as day, by the uninterrupted flashes of cannon and musketry. The Prince Viceroy, re garding these absurd measures and movements no more than the buzzing of flies or the yelping of dogs, from his perfect presence of mind and natural dignity, permitted not a single wrinkle to visit his forehead. Next day he continued his march, and honoured the halting-place of Shamkur by his pi e ' sence. There the inhabitants of Ganjah, who had been obliged to emigrate from their native abodes, were made partakers of the prince's unbounded liberality and sympathy. On leaving that station,dynasty op the kajars. 239 he next procGeded to Zakum; and on his arrival there, a body of Russians, who were advancing to Ganjah with provisions to assist Ashpukhdar, came in sight: the Prince Viceroy looked upon their arrival as a great advantage and important acquisi tion, and commanded his lion-hunting warriors to pursue them. Phis body of men, devoid of dignity, immediately collected their waggons and loads of provisions together, threw up exceedingly strong entrenchments for their defence, and stood a siege in the midst of these works. The fortune-favoured troops, who, in comparison to them, were as the dust of the desert or the trees of the wood, formed their slight arrangements, made many valorous assaults and charges; in the course of which, two of the leaders and several of the soldiers were slain, and an officer of high rank and many others were made prisoners. As the troops of the victorious prince had not with them any field artillery, by which they ni ight batter down the waggons of the entrench ments, and thus slay or make prisoners of the sur vivors, he did not regard the besieged to be of suf ficient importance that, in order to capture them, le shoul d expose some of his devoted and gallant warriors to destruction: besides this, the retinue, loured by victory, was fettered with all the em- ar rassments arising from the men, women, high fid from Ganjah; and to continue the siege j 0r man y ctays, in a desert of that district, would la ^e been painful: therefore the prince did not pur- SUe tllls object beyond what has been mentioned, ^ tile sublime retinue proceeded to Akhtafeh-i- uzak. As the protection of and providing for 5000 ClMM) householders of Ganjah, their domestics240 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. and families, in the victorious camp, became exceed ingly difficult, the prince, from excess of humanity and innate compassion, commanded that they should proceed to Erivan by the way of Hasan Lu, accompanied by Pir Kuly Khan and Muhammed Kuly Khan ; and from thence to Tabreez. In con sequence of the Prince Viceroy's perfect authority and dignity, and his enforcement of strict discipline and vigilance, it resulted, that though the people of Ganjah, as before mentioned, had in a state of distraction and confusion repaired to the camp, and brought with them all the goods and effects they were able to carry off, yet such was the order the Prince Viceroy had established amongst his troops, that they exhibited the greatest zeal in protecting the property, domestics, and children, of these poor fugitives; and neither officers nor soldiers, through fear of the royal displeasure, had either will or opportunity to appropriate to themselves a single article of their effects or necessaries, much less ol purloining gold or silver. Among other instances, one deserves relation : a sealed purse, containing 2000 ashrafees *, belonging to one of the people of Ganjah, was found by a Ghoolam of the splendid and glorious court, who, without breaking the seal or opening the purse, carried it back to the owner, and delivered it to him. In addition to all this, on their arrival in Teheran, the justice -dispensing, OP' pression-punishing monarch, the protector of the unfortunate, sent them, as a donation, a conside rable sum in gold and silver; which was entrusted to Mulla Malik Muhammed, Kazi -ul-Asghar, who, * A ecold coin.dynasty of the kajars. 241 in pursuance of the royal command, brought it to Tabreez, and divided it amongst the high and low. On the advance of the fortune-favoured standards to the territory of Akhastafeh-i-Kazy, and their halt there during a few days, many of the nobles of Kakht, with envoys from Yengi Kalah in Teflis, accompanied by several Cossack chiefs, repaired to the victory-ennobled stirrup : the tenor of their discourse was, that whenever the triumphant stan dard should move in the direction of Teflis, the people of Gurjistan («.e. Georgia) would massacre the few Russians remaining in Teflis and return to their allegiance, and by the performance of this glorious deed exalt themselves beyond their glials. But as at this time it had come to the knowledge of the Ministers of the august court, that, by order of the Russian Emperor, a conside- uible force, under the command of Shufat, was directed to proceed by way of Resht, for the pur pose of carrying on hostilities against the Governors 0 f that country, and for the subjugation of Gilan, it was apparent that the exalted energy of the world- subduing sovereign must be first directed to check and repel the Russians in that quarter. Prudence therefore dictated the propriety of waiting for some (v ent to occur in Gurjistan which might render it advisable and safe to move the royal standard to that country; and, as at this moment the operations 0 f the Russians in Gilan (the seat of agriculture) Seated great confusion in the province, the advance lnt() Gurjistan was opposed to all policy and the Maxims of dominion. The Prince Viceroy there- fore deferred the expedition, and turned the reins of242 dynasty of the kajars. departure from Akhastafeh-i-Kazy towards Erivan. During this march, a body of empty-brained, infa tuated, silly Cossacks formed the plan of inter cepting the resistless, unsuspecting torrent (i. e. the prince), and by such an act to exhibit their attach ment to the Russians, and thus free themselves from the imputation of sincerity or zeal to the eternal empire, and, by such an attempt, stop all future inquiry or punishment by the Russians of their past conduct: it was with this design they formed this plan, and attempted to execute it. From the station of Akhastafeh-i-Kazy to Juka'i in Erivan is a distance of eighteen parasangs : the coun try is entirely mountainous, covered with large and closely-interwoven trees, so that until this time a great army had never passed by that route : there the Cossacks posted themselves in ambush, among mountains, where a clear space of ground to stand upright on could scarcely be found ; but if by chance such a space was discovered, they cut down large trees and piled them across the tract, so as com pletely to block up the passage against the army of the difficulty-surmounting Viceroy. The prince, however, placing his reliance on the mercies of the Creator, on the Holy Spirit (i. e. Mohammed) of the Lord of the Righteous, and of his heroic successor Aly, and the pure Imams, proceeded with all his bag gage and stores by that route, which even a single person found difficult to proceed in, from the quantity and closeness of the trees : and so excellent were the prince's arrangements, that the army did not to e behind them a single article worth naming: but,DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 2iS during the whole of the time, this body of trea cherous Cossacks everywhere seized on the com- manding points, from whence they made a series of attacks; all of which proving unsuccessful, they at last took to flight. Notwithstanding that the nobles and officers urgently represented to the prince, that, in such a position, to continue embarrassed with baggage and stores was quite at variance with the dictates of prudence and caution, and ' that therefore it would be best the Prince Viceroy ' should depart with his retinue and guards, and endeavour to reach some place of security,' the prince not only rejected this advice, but manifested extreme wrath at the proposal; continuing the ut most care of the transport of the baggage and stores, and the most unremitting attention to every individual of the army who suffered from the effects of fatigue or sickness. The following occurrence is still more wonderful, and worthy of being nar rated :—At the time the prince alighted for prayer, they presented him a cup of sherbet; and just at that moment a Cossack, from behind a tree, aimed a musket at the person of the holy-minded Viceroy. this critical situation the Almighty was the prince's protector, and the spirit of the pure Imams aided him ; for the ball grazed the heel of the illus trious Viceroy's boot without doing the slightest mjury to the virtuous prince's sacred person. On Witnessing this, the soldiers grasped their muskets, ai id dispersed themselves through the forests, and shot whomsoever they found. After this, the army proceeded to Erivan, in perfect order, tranquillity, u 2211* dynasty of the kajars. and security: and there the prince communicated to the Beglerbegs, officers, and cultivators of the country, the glad assurance of the climate-conquer ing sovereign's boundless mercies. The prince im mediately devoted himself to the organization and supply of all that was requisite for the security of the fort; and respectfully submitted to the heaven like court, through the medium of Muhammed Khan Kara Guz Lu, his trusty counsellor, an earnest re quest for permission to remain in Azarbai'jan during the continuance of the Russian war. The prince also supplicated, ' that the fortunate and highly- ic favoured Kebla* of the world and mankind should ' return to the seat of Government; since, by the ' aid of the Almighty, and the undecaying fortune ' of the incomparable king of kings, his servants, so ' distinguished for loyal service, are sufficiently able ' to happily subdue all his enemies: for as long as ' their bodies remain animated, and breath remains ' in their nostrils, they will sacrifice themselves for ' his service.'

L1V. AN ACCOUNT OF THE ARRIVAL OF SHUFAT WITH A RUSSIAN ARMA MENT AGAINST RESHT ; AND OF HIS DEFEAT AND FLIGHT. T he inveterate Ashpukhdar, the year before, in consequence of the prowess of the fortune-favoured armies, had requested from the Russian Emperor a su pply of troops to advance on another quarter. Agreeably to this request. Governor Shufat, more ungovernable than a furious elephant, with twelve ships of war laden with experienced soldiers, dragon-formed, flame-scattering guns, ammuni tion, and various stores, was ordered to proceed by the Sea of Khazar (the Caspian), to Resht. Haying set sail, they cast anchor in the vicinity of Taulish; and proceeded from thence, after an interval of two days, to the Castle of Enzelle. At the time of their arrival, the few musketeers who were sta tioned for the defence of that place, by order of the Governor of Dilman, left their post; so that the Russians made it the place of their disembarkment. His majesty's confidential servant, Mirza Musa Munajjem Bashy, who had been selected to arrange the affairs of Gilan, when the king, magnificent as Jamshid, had moved from Teheran, on hearing this intelligence, in concert with the governors and chieftains of the country, formed a plan for repelling the insolent invasion of the Russians; thus display- ln g to his majesty, endued with solar energies, his ^ 0 yal zeal. For this purpose he threw up strong entrenchments in the station called Piree Bazar; a Ppointed a body of musketeers, rapid as lightning, to the right and left of the avenues of Piree Bazar;246 dynasty of the kajars. and also posted a number of resolute men in the entrenchments, whilst he himself lay in ambush. The next morning, when the dawn swallowed up the hosts of darkness, in the same manner as Moses directed the Nile to swallow up the copper-coloured Copts, the imprudent Shufat, through excess of that pride which is the infatuated admirer of the bride of victory, girt himself with the girdle of exertion, to storm the entrenchments of Piree Bazar, and at once to terminate the affairs of Resht by means of his rapidly-moving infantry and flamc-\ omiting ai tillery ; but the musketeers on his flanks, being ready to take advantage of every opportunity, and quite prepared for the contest, simultaneously main tained so fierce a combat in the middle of the jungle, that the smoke of their guns ascended to the fiery sphere : from both sides they poured on the Russians the hail of destruction, so that in the twinkling of an eye a deluge of blood flowed from their impure carcases. The Russians became aware of their situation, when nearly a thousand of their men were scattered, like vine-leaves by the autumna winds, along the surface of the jungle, and the chains of disgrace and humiliation were appende to the souls of these worthless wretches ; and such of them who escaped the slaughter, covered wit disgrace and humiliation, after encountering the greatest difficulties, sheltered themselves in the Fort of Enzelle.

When the Prince Viceroy, by his presence, con- fen-ed splendor on Tabreez, the seat of royalty, he received the whole of the army, and cultivators, under the shadow of his beneficence and the shade of his mercy : he threw open the gates of clemency and protection before the face of all men inhabiting this Paradise-like region, high and low, great and small. The refractory chieftains of Azarba'ijan, without exception, bowed the head to the tenor of his obedience-requiring commands, and opened the gates of mediation and intercession at his sublime court. Although the Prince Viceroy felt intense grief and trouble at being deprived of the privilege oi kissing the threshold of the world-subduing so vereign's palace, he however consoled his noble ftund by the reflection of being entirely occupied in the royal service, so that he wholly devoted himself to regulating the administration of the affairs of Azarba'ijan. Immediately on the prince's arrival at Tabreez, the seat of royalty, there came credible communications from Shaikh Aly Khan, Beglerbeg 0 f Kubbeh and Derbend, from Sarkha'i Khan La- S a zy, and Husain Kuly Khan, governor of Badkobah, 111 which they represented as follows, and prayed248 DYNASTY OF THE KA.IARS. for assistance—' That it is most probable the infa- &lt;f tuated Shufat, after his flight from Gilan, will ' next undertake a hostile expedition against Bad- ' kobah, and from thence extend the hand and arm ' of violence to this kingdom, it becomes neces- ' sary therefore to appoint a Governor capable of ' maintaining the Fort of BMkobah.' On this, the Prince Viceroy immediately issued peremptory or ders to Shaikh Aly Khan, Sarkha'i Khan Lagazy, and Husain Kuly Khan, inciting and exhorting them to maintain Badkobah, and prevent the occupation of it by the Russians. He also commanded a con fidential officer to set out for Badkobah with abun dant supplies of ammunition and stores ot every description—lead, gunpowder, cash, and all other necessaries in the greatest profusion. Shufat, after his flight from Gilan, set sail and anchored before BMkobah ; where he displayed his hostile standard, and with alarm -exciting cannon- balls poured flames into the abodes and dwellings of those inhabiting the fort. In like manner, Husain Kuly Khan, and the inhabitants, by lighting up the fire of battle and discharging ponderous cannon- balls, repelled the vigorous assault and wide -spread devastation: the mighty contest was thus carried on between the Russians and Husain Kuly Khan along the sea-shore. During this, the garrison, with the world-astounding battering-cannon, had so damaged several Russian ships of war, that nunib^ of the detestable race were overwhelmed in the abysses of ruin and destruction. The Russians, however, continued to advance by land with un remitting obstinacy, and to shower down hallsDYNASTY OP THE KAJARS. 249 destructive as lightning into the space between the walls and the foit, and to cause the flames of war to blaze in every direction around the castle.

They acted in co-operation with Husain Kuly Khan ; and during several days the devouring flame of battle mounted on high, both inside and outside the fort: at last the Russian force, having suffered considerably, retired from the environs of the castle into their ships ; and having departed with great precipitation to Daban, took some repose in Pusht Sary, in Taulish.

AN ACCOUNT OF THE ADVANCE OF ASHPUKHDAR TO BADKOBAH, WITH THE VIEW OF CAPTURING THE FORT ; HIS NEGOCIATION WITH HUSAIN KULY KHAN OF BADKOBAH ; AND HIS DEATH, BY THE HAND OF IBRAHIM BEG, GHOOLAM TO THE EXALTED VICEGERENT. W hile the sublime retinue continued at the royal residence of Tabreez, there arrived representations from Mustafa Khan of Shirwan, announcing the departure of the ill-starred Ashpukhdar from Ganjah, 111 the direction of Shirwan; and also containing the most pressing solicitation for assistance and re inforcements : on the receipt of this intelligence the Prince Viceroy immediately ordered Pir Kuly Khan, With a detachment of lion-hunting, intrepid warriors, to his aid. On arriving at the banks of the River ur, twelve leagues from Shirwan, this commander250 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. ascertained that Mustafa Khan, through the feeble ness of his understanding, had laid the foundation of an intrigue with the Russians ; that he had con trived to have an interview with Ashpukhdar; and in order to clear the way to a mutual understanding, had thrown open the gates of treaty and amity; and being actuated by fraud and treachery, had made with him a deceitful peace (i. e. a wolf's peace). Ashpukhdar also, inspired with arrogance by this man's representations, advanced against BMkobah, and was joined on that side by Shufat, from Saru. At this moment there came also des patches from Husain Kuly Khan, soliciting re inforcements. On receiving this intelligence, the Prince Viceroy commanded Husain Kuly Khan Kajar to set off, with an expedition consisting ot rapidly-moving troops; and sent also, in advance, Askar Khan Afshar with 1000 cavalry, swift as the lightning or the storm, with orders to enter the Fort of Badkobah, and to exert themselves zealously in assisting Husain Kuly Khan. He next oidered Ahmed Khan Mukaddam, Beglerbeg of Tabreez and Maragah, previous to the movement of the re tinue, splendid as the starry hosts, to proceed with a train of fire-vomiting guns, and intrepid warriors, both infantry and cavalry. Although it was now the middle of winter, and the severity of the cold was intense, at which time the smoke of aloes-wood is more agreeable than the scent ot the Sweet Basil 01 Hycicinth ;—for now the masses of clouds, piled on each other, displayed their world-subduing banners over the whole horizon; and the descending, glorious snows, covered the summit of hill and mountaindynasty of the kajars. 251 with pellucid and argent-like gems it was in such a season that the Prince Viceroy revolved in his exalted mind the utter annihilation of the Russians; and on the 22d of Zi-kaadeh-ul-Haram, the waving tresses of the victory-ennobled banners moved from Tabreez, the seat of royalty, shedding their perfume by way of Ardebil, in the direction of Mughan. On arriving at Ardebil (the seat of ortho doxy), there came a representation from Pir Kuly Khan, to this purport—' That Askar Khan Afshar, ' conformably to the orders of the fortunate and ex- ' alted Viceroy, had arrived, with a torrent-like ' rapidity, at the fort; that Husain Kuly Khan had ' moved forward to secure the bridge over the (( ^ ur » ^ iat Pi 1 ' Khan had taken post outside | the Fort of Badkobah, where he had been joined I h y Shaikh Aly Khan ; that the infatuated Ash- ' pukhdar, through a complete reverse of fortune, I was now in that district, involved in deep distress difficulty, as all his carriages had been lost u l)ro ken to pieces, either through the severity (( ^ ftlle winter, or by a violent storm which had also a ^ estro yed the shipping on the Sea of Khazar (( \ e ' ^ le ^ a spian); so that, from want of provi- (( 810118 fuel, he had, from all sides, become a (( ^ utt to tlle archers of want and woe, and a mark * or the shafts of ruin and calamity.'

At that moment there came forward Ibrahim Beg, Ghoolam, son to the paternal uncle ot Husain Ivuly K.han of Badkobah, who bore away the precedency from his equals and cotemporaries by habitual rectitude and innate capacity, and who through bravery and magnani mity had inscribed on the tablet of his soul the images of important services and of attainment to exalted office. The Prince Viceroy having intui tively perceived his natural talents, distinguished him by an appointment among his peculiar attend ants, and had ordered him from his gracious pre sence to join Husain Kuly Khan at Badkobah. ^ At the moment Ashpukhdar and Husain Kuly Khan had met, and made propositions for an interview, Ibrahim Beg, with Husain's permission, and without the prince's sanction, slew him with a musket-ball*; on which Pir Kuly Khan Kajar, Husain Kuly Kha , and the other commanders, surrounded his escort; some of them were slain; others made prisoners; whilst such as survived, fled, and, in concert wit Shufat, embarked in their ships and proceeded to Sam. These Khans directed Ashpukhdar's con fused head, which he through pride and insolence rubbed against the solar diadem, to be cut o , and sent it by couriers to the seat of Govemmen • The Prince Viceroy had, however, given ex P u ^ commands to those employed on the expedition * The true account of this affair will not turn much to the ^ of the Persians; as the reader will see from the accoun g in the Notes of this most unjustifiable transaction.dynasty of the kajars. 253 repel this rash man in the field of battle, and not to slay him at the moment of interview; and therefore this sad present gave no pleasure to his noble mind, but, on the contrary, he delivered his enlightened soul to affliction. CHAP. LVII. SOME OF THE NOBLES OF AZARBA'UAN ARE ORDERED TO ERIVAN. On the death of the imprudent Ashpukhdar, the world-enlightening prudence of the sovereign prince determined to chastise or destroy the rebels of Shurah Gil, Pambak, Ganjah, and Gurjistan : and as, during a long period, Jaafer Kuly Khan had, with a body of Russians, occupied the Fort of Taleen in Erivan, and extended the hand of usur pation and ravage all over the country, therefore Mahdy Kuly Khan Kajar, Beglerbeg of Erivan, Husain Kuly Khan, Beglerbeg of Roomeah, Ismail Khan, governor of Khoie, and Kalb Aly Khan, governor of Nakshiwan, with a numerous force of Afshars of Erivan, Kunker Lu Khoi'e, and others, ttere appointed by the Prince Viceroy to extirpate the Russians and Jaafer Kuly Khan. In addition to these, Hajy Muhammed Khan Kara Guz Lu, one 0 [ the nobles of that tribe, the ancient servant of his ever fortunate majesty, and distinguished by the unlimited confidence reposed in him in all exalted commissions, was appointed to execute this express service, with a command : ' That immediately on arriving at Taleen, a strong fort should be erected opposite that of Taleen, which now affords pro- 'oction to Jaafer Kuly Khan and the Russiansdynasty op the kajars. « of that district; and having placed in it 1000 ' musketeers, let every avenue to supplies of pro- ' visions, or the flight of the garrison of Taleen, '&lt; ]30 carefully closed up 5 and after this, let the ' chief, according to the dictates of wisdom and pm- ' dence, exert due care and energy in the perform- ' ance of their other incumbent duties.' On the mere announcement of this report, before the ar rival of the leaders and their victorious troops in the vicinity of the fort, Jaafer Kuly Khan and the Russians fled from Taleen ; and many of them, in their flight, fell into the hands of Mahdy Kuly Khan's advanced column. During this year, many Pashas along the Turkish frontier, having abandoned the path ol ancient custom, had in a hostile manner repeatedly com mitted ravages in the territories of Erivan; and watching a favourable opportunity, had extended their predatory incursions in every quarter. Of this number was Ibrahim Basha, governor of Baizid, who had sent three or four thousand men to make an attack on the tribes of Erivan, and had exercised his arm in the most intolerable ravage and oppres sion. Kalb Aly Khan, governor of Nakhshiwan, being determined to inflict severe chastisement on the invaders, with his own regiments of cavalry and infantry made with them a rapid movement, and attacked the invaders, many of whom were slam and taken prisoners. The other Pashas, after this, from dread of the preparations and the forces collected in Azarba'ijan, shrouded the head ot ex cess under the mantle of humiliation, and covered the foot of aggression with the skirt ot courtesy •dynasty of the kajars. ^55 they therefore forwarded to the Prince Viceroy's court humble supplications of apology, repentance, and promises to abstain in future from such repre hensible acts and deeds: on which they obtained horn the Durbar, the seat of majesty, both elevation and distinction, by the despatch to them of valua ble dresses of honour. When the chieftains and leaders had assembled, the following plan of ope- rations was flxed upon Mahdy Kuly Khan and Mb Aly Khan were ordered to proceed imme- ately to chastise the Russians of Shurah Ghil and rembak; and Ismail Khan and Hajy Muhammed were ordered to advance to Ganjah, and exe cute the service assigned to them. After this arrange ment, the chiefs destined for Ganjah set out; and laving made a descent on the country between anjah and reflis, they spread dismay and de vastation on all sides: they daily traversed the environs of Ganjah, plundering and slaughtering indiscriminately the Armenians and Moslems. The mice Viceroy, on his return from fighting against tie Russians of Karabagh, issued this order to these r S t ' lat t ' le c ' 1 ' e '' s commissioned at present „ exhibit unceasing energy in guarding the fron- tier of Erivan.' At this time, intelligence ar- ve to these chieis of the expedition, that Mahdy ■7, Khan and Kalb Aly Khan had met with 'wing important; and also, that Jaafer Kuly an, with the Russians of Pambak and Shurah 11, had presumptuously assembled a large force, intended to attack the tribes of Erivan : there- the chiefs, with due caution and sound policy.256 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. set out from Ganjah to Erivan ; on learning which movement, the force collected by Jaafer Kuly Khan and the Russians, being dispersed and discouraged, fled to their respective strong holds : and the chiefs, having thus settled the affairs of Erivan, resumed their positions, by order of the Prince Viceroy.

The Prince \ iceroy, being informed of this design, com missioned his Vizir, Mirza Buzurg, the essence of nobility and virtue, to calm his apprehensions; so that his mind being tranquillized, he might cause Shufat and his associates to evacuate the Island of Sam, by cutting off the passage of provisions, fuel, and othei necessaries with which that island is sup plied from the shores of Langeran. This matchless ^izir, on an interview with Mustafa Khan, allayed his terror, and confirmed the hopes of his majesty's unlimited grace and pardon, as well as of the libe rality of the munificent Viceroy. On this, he in stantly cut off the supply of provisions and all other necessaries from Shufat and his associates ; who, in the extreme severity of winter, became a prey to famine and despondence, and wandered about in the deserts of perplexity ; and therefore, before he effected his object, great numbers of his force were destroyed by famine and the severity of the winter. Mustafa Khan of Shirwan, seeing affairs in this sta te, repented, and became ashamed of his con duct ; he advanced to the River Kur, and solicited a n interview with Ahmed Khan, Beglerbeg of Ta- hreez, who at the moment was stationed in that country, on the banks of the Kur, with an army of determined resolution, fully equipped and provided ; an d at that interview he renewed his solemn assur ances of fidelity. He also solemnly declared, that 111 future he would faithfully obey the orders (re quiring implicit obedience), of the world-subduing Sovereign, and would never more deviate from the258 dynasty of the kajars. directions he might receive from the magnanimous prince; but for ever remain, with firm step and determined perseverance, in the royal road of loyal and devoted service. CHAP. L1X. AN ACCOUNT OF EVENTS DURING THE YEAR OF THE HEJIRA 1221 (A. D. 1806): THE INCURSION OF AI.Y PASHA, GOVERNOR OF BAGDAD, TOWARDS KERMANSHAH ; AND OF HIS DEFEAT BY THE TROOPS OF IRAN. When the solar Jamshid had transferred his abode from the sphere of Pisces to the porticoes of Aries; and spring, who is the painter of time, had mode rated the severity of the cold; when the armies of heat ascended hills and mountains, and the drums ( l e. the thunder) of the vernal clouds, in the ex panse of the gloom-overcast skies, sounded in loud uproar; when the northern breeze, charged by the rains of spring, put to rout the hosts of December; and the nightingale, perched on the rose -branch, pouring forth her thousand melodious strains, ex pelled the ravens from the garden ; and when, from the violence of the vernal gales, the surface of the azure sky became as clear as the mental mirror of the sage's breast; ' Then the breeze sang its amorous ditty to the rose -garden: ' The gem-scattering shower refreshed the tulip-beds, ' The fragrance of existence revisited the leafless stems, , ' And the world, renewed in splendor, arose like the bowers o Paradise— at that season, the sovereign of the glorious and triumphant realms sat on his diamond -stucUK'DYNASTY OF THE K A JARS. 259 throne, to celebrate the festival of the Nurooz. Ac cording to custom, all the Nobles and Vizirs of enlightened understanding, and favoured by fortune, were so distinguished by the unequalled monarch's boundless munificence, that the pockets and skirts of their hopes and wishes were completely filled. On the termination of this festive and joyous pe- riod, the sovereign's exalted mind returned with its usual energy to the transaction of State affairs. Abd-ur-rahmin Pasha, governor of 13aba)i, having been, through the evil practices of Aly Pasha, Waly o{ Bagdad, expelled from his territory, left the sub lime Othman kingdom, and placed the hand of sup plication on the mantle of generosity, in which the empire based on eternity is clothed. The beneficent sovereign, protector of the afflicted, conferred on bim distinctions and favours; and assigned him a district in Kurdistan, within which his tribe and dependants, amounting to nearly 5000 souls, might reside. Besides this, this highly-talented perso nage was decorated with magnificent dresses and multiplied donations: the Ministers of the realm (daily increasing in prosperity) also opened to the faee of his fortunes the gates of honour and dis tinction, and spread the bounteous tables of intel ligence and zeal in the banqueting-hall of his hopes. A firman, requiring implicit obedience to the com mands it contained, delivered by Mirza Sadik Merv, private secretary and news-reporter, and another trustworthy person, was issued forth, n ith due distinction, to Aly Pasha of Bagdad, s 2DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. requiring the re-establishment and restoration to authority of Abd-ur-rahmin Pasha. Aly Pasha, how ever, had recourse to foolish excuses, and endea voured to retard the execution of the royal orders by sending worthless presents: in appearance, he shewed himself ready to obey the kings com mands without making difficulties about it; but in reality, as he observed the ever-victorious troops were on one side much engaged in the Russian war; and on the other, occupied in fighting against the Afghans of Kandahar and Herat, and the Uzbegs of Merv and Turkistan ; he foolishly imagined the royal camp to be wholly destitute of experienced soldiers; and, from his contracted understanding, making an attempt to soar on high, rushed into the path of rebellion ; and did not suffer the recol lection of the long-established and ancient friend ship between the two States of Othman and Iran to pass before his mind. He marched out of the Bagdad territory with 30,000 cavalry and infantry, a park of artillery, and every other military equip ment ; and proceeded, by way of Zahab, to r i W' Ktirra; where he halted, having dragged his artil lery over hills and mountains. This intelligence came to the wide-ruling king in the Plain of Sulta- niyah ; and as his most equitable majesty had never contemplated the possibility of such an absurd and desperate movement, nor ever thought of hostili ties against the Othman Empire (with which treaties and conventions of amity had subsisted for years), he had considered the continuance of firm friend-DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 261 ship between the two high States as settled. The dictates of a high mind, jealous of honour, however instantly determined him to chastise the Pasha intoxicated by the cup of pride; and therefore he ordered the victorious prince, Muhammed Aly Mirza, to advance, by way of Hamadan and Kermanshah, with a considerable force of experienced infantry and cavalry, accompanied by several noblemen ; such as, Ibrahim Khan, Muhammed Aly Khan, Sham Biyaty, Nurooz Khan, the Ishik Akasy Bashy, Aman Allah Khan, Waly of Kurdistan, and Farraj Allah Khan Kajar, the Nasakchy Bashy. Prince Mu hammed Aly Mirza, on leaving Kermanshah, came to the station of Kurend, where he ordered a con siderable body of the ever-victorious troops, under the command of Farraj Allah Khan and Aman Al lah Kan, to proceed by way of Sulimaniah. At the same time, Aly Pasha detached 12,000 cavalry and infantry of Bagdad, under the command of Suleiman Pasha, his Kahiya, against Abd-ur-rahmin Pasha, who, with his dependants, children, and clan, dwelt at Dirah, on the confines of Kurdistan. On learn ing the movement of the victorious army tow r ards that country, and the line of march of the tri umphant prince, fear and terror having seized Aly Pasha's heart, he retreated some stages from Tak Karra; and in the mean time, Suleiman Pasha Kahiya, leaving his stores and baggage in the rear, endeavoured to surprise Abd-ur-rahmin Pasha; think- ln g, that before the arrival of information, or the appearance of the Iranian chiefs, he could termi nate the affair to his satisfaction. In one day and262 DYNASTY OF THE KAJAIIS. night, he performed a march ol twenty-two para- sangs : but Abd-ur-rahmin Pasha, at the dawn of day, receiving notice of this forced march, left his family and children behind; and taking with him his friends and allies, drew them out in order ol battle; having first sent a person, with all haste, to apprise Farraj Allah Khan and Aman Allah Khan of the frauds and plots of his implacable foes. On hear ing this intelligence, they immediately set out with a part of the ever-victorious troops, although the rear-guard was still far behind. The nobles arrived on the field of battle just at the moment when Abd- ur -rahmin was defeated, and on the point of flight and ruin. Farraj Allah Khan, and the other chief tains, on witnessing this posture of affairs, drew their rapidly-striking swords, and charged the sol diers of Suleiman Pasha. The martial weapons ol these noble Khans were found in every part of the tumult of the varied contest; the heads of cham pions, smitten off by the curved blade of the cres cent-shaped faulchion, were rolling over the plain, like so many balls ; the blood -shedding sword, an the gore-dripping spear, became, in the warriors hands, as veins of the ruby or branches of the coral. For one hour and a half, horse and foot intermingled, and maintained the combat: at last, through the holy influence of the King o Valour (Aly), and the energetic power of the c i- mate -conquering sovereign's horoscope, the Bagda army was defeated: nearly 3000 persons were slain ; and Suleiman Pasha, and 2000 or 3000 men, were taken prisoners. Abd-ur-rahmin Pasha ^asDYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 263 restored to full power in Sulimaniah; and Suleiman Pasha was sent to wait on the prince. The tri umphant prince next commanded Nurooz Khan Kajar, the Keshsheck Akasy Bashy, to march on Zahab, with a force drawn from the tribe of Mad- An-Lu and Jehan-Beg-Lu Kurds, and Kara Guz Lu. The governor, Futtah Pasha, through desire of embracing the bride of victory and triumph, drew out his forces to oppose Nurooz Khan. After many alternations of battle and countless exertions, not finding his efforts crowned with success, he averted his face from the contest, as the virgin averts her wreathed locks from her lover ; and Nurooz Khan pursued the fugitives as far as the station of Baucoo- kh, in the territory of Bagdad ; from whence, after making great slaughter and many prisoners, he re turned to Zahab, sweeping that place also with the besom of plunder and devastation, and then setting fire to it. On hearing these events and successive defeats, Aly Pasha's heart became a prey to ardent Egrets: his power was now changed into weakness, and his camp in one instant dispersed ; so that being thus involved in distress and perplexity, he determined 01 i flight. When he reflected on the evil disposition towards him of the people of his Pashalik, he felt n o tranquillity until he arrived in the vicinity of the tort; when he halted, at one post from the city*. He then sent as his intercessor with the victorious prince, the high in dignity, the holy in title, the supreme pontif of the age and time. Shaikh Jaafer Khazza'i (whom he had invited from the most holy Najf), to apologize for his criminal deeds : he also entreated * i .e. of Bagdad.2(3 t DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. the prince to act the part of mediator with the so vereign powerful as Jamshid, to pardon his foul acts, and to request the oblivion of his unworthy conduct. This virtuous Shaikh having also solicited the libe ration of the prisoners, the prince collected them all, both male and female, and delivered them to the holy man. The prince also interceded with the unequalled sovereign to forgive the criminal acts and the reprehensible conduct of Aly Pasha; who had excited the dust of altercation and hostility between the two exalted realms of Iran and Room, and who had, in contempt of friendly treaties, with out any reason but his own folly, caused the shed ding of much innocent blood, on both sides. The sovereign, the asylum of the world, accepted the prince's mediation ; and in conformity with the Shaikh's desire, the army distinguished by victory was withdrawn from the environs of Bagdad to the imperial stirrup. The prince also, by the royal command, wrote a declaration to Aly Pasha, and at the same time issued an order to the people of Bag dad, to this purport: ' That they must not allow ' themselves to rebel against the Pasha, nor to dis- ' obey his orders and decrees; since his misdeeds had ' been pardoned, and he had met with this indulg- 4 ' ence at the imperial court: he was now therefore ' received into the ranks of the faithful friends and ' zealous supporters of the empire based on etcr- ' nity.' Suleiman Pasha Kahiya was also sent to the Durbar of the king of kings; and on his arrh al, he was lodged, by the crime-pardoning sovereign^ order, in the house of the confidential Minister ot State, Mirza Muhammed Shafia, where he receiveddynasty of the kajars. 265 all kinds of attention. In the middle of Zi-kaadeh- ul-Haram, HajyYusuf Pasha, formerly Grand Vizir, but now Pasha with full powers over Erzeroom and Eastern Kara Hissar and the other dependencies of that region, and also the Generalissimo of the Sublime Othman Emperor, sent to the Prince- Viceroy's Durbar, the centre of majesty, Faiz Ullah Mahmud Effendi, in the character of Envoy. This person was one of the distinguished domestics of the firmly-based court*, and educated under the highly-dignified Pasha's inspection. On his arrival at Tabreez, he had the honour of being presented to the Prince Viceroy; to whom he had a friendly letter, containing excuses for the unseemly deeds and criminal movements of Aly Pasha, Waly of Bagdad; with a request that Suleiman PashaKahiya might be released; which was backed by the favour able opinions of the counsellors of State. In con sequence, the Prince Viceroy interceded also with the triumphant sovereign for his liberation: on which, this common benefactor of the world not on ly gave him permission to return to Turkey, but invested him with valuable dresses ; and commanded nn, thus filled with delight by the attainment of lls ^ es,r e, to proceed to Bagdad (the seat of orthodoxy).

Shufat, with the destruction of his friends and asso ciates ; and observing the conciliation adopted to wards Mustafa Khan, governor of Taulish; began to entertain hopes of security and pardon: he there fore despatched apologetic representations, by trusty agents, to the Durbar the centre of majesty, and besought the Prince Viceroy to become the inter cessor for his crimes, and his advocate for obtaining pardon from the great monarch, powerful as heaven, for his innumerable offences. The generous- minded prince sent Ibrahim's agents to the Durbar the centre of the world, furnished with supplica tions and intercessions: in consequence of which, a royal firman was issued forth with due distinction, purporting, ' That in consideration of his professed tf repentance ot what has past, his offences are co 'vered with pardon and indulgence.' Ibrahim Khalil Khan, on receiving this intelligence, became exceedingly delighted ; and in order to prove t e sincerity of his intentions, and the purity of good faith, formed the purpose of expelling the Russians from Karabagh : he therefore conveyed, by his son-in-law, to Ardebil (the orthodox), wher the Prince Viceroy then was, letters indicating ms sincerity; requesting the victory-distinguished tra of the triumphant Viceroy to move towards Kara bagh; and to order Abul Futtah Khan to advance, by way of Kapan, with a body of experienced men, and Farraj Allah Khan Shahun, with another force selected from the ever-victorious troops, to proceet by way of Chanakchy, in advance of the retim 16 numerous as the starry hosts. The Prince Vice 1 - 0 ) instantly realised his hopes, by despatching ^ 11 Futtah Khan and Farraj Allah Khan in advanceDYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 267 of the ever-auspicious retinue; and on the heels of these, the vice-regal banner, floating like the bird of Paradise, winged its course towards Karabagh. Crossing the bridge of Khoda Afreen on the Aras, Abul Futtah Khan fell back from the vicinity of Fort Panahabad; where he had ascertained that Jaafer Kuly Beg, grandson to Ibrahim Khalil Khan, had communicated to the Russian garrison the real state of his grandfather's affairs; and on the night of the 23d of Rabi-ul-awwal, he admitted 300 men of the Russian force into his own house, outside the fort. Previous to this, Ibrahim Khalil Khan had halted outside the fort with his domestics and child ren, and, using neither vigilance nor caution, had encamped with fatal security. The third or fourth Hour of the night had elapsed, when these troops fell pitilessly on him, and consumed in the flames of injustice and slaughter his wife, the sister of Selim Khan Shakaky, with his daughter, who was niece to Humay Khan Lesghee, and many other wales and females of his family, who fell like moths fluttering about the flames of the taper-like muskets. Having thus lighted up the fire of inhumanity and fearless cruelty in the world, with the axe of tyran nous iniquity they felled the aged tree of Ibra- h'ni Khalil Khan's life: in the extremity of his old a ge tliey stocked it up from the ground, filled up J' le P^ce where it stood with the earth of ruin and mmiliation, and dried up the fountain of so many years of prosperity. The Prince Viceroy however advanced, without delay or hesitation, to give battle to the Russians in Panahabad; and during his ln arch, representations came to him, from Selim268 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. Khan, governor of Shakaky, to this purport: ' That ' in respect to the corps of Russians, which two ' years before he had introduced into Shakaky, in ' opposition to Muhammed Khan Shirwanee, to ' whom he had paid implicit obedience ; he now, on ' merely hearing of the arrival ot the exalted reti- ' nue in this region, and learning the massacre ot « Ibrahim Khalil Khan, had almost extirpated them, ' and forced them to fly to Ganjah. Having thus ' in a suitable manner manifested his loyal zeal and ' sincere devotedness, he hoped and entreated that ' in this hour of peril he should receive such aid as ' would ensure his own safety.' The Prince Vice roy, agreeably to his prayer, sent Farraj Allah Khan Shahun to his assistance, with a detachment ot the tiger-subduing warriors. CHAP. LXI. AN ACCOUNT OF THE SECOND MOVEMENT OF THE EXALTED RETINIE TO KARABAGH, FOR THE PURPOSE OF GIVING BATTLE TO T RUSSIANS. As most of the tribes of Karabagh, after the mas sacre of Ibrahim Khalil Khan, had entreated p el mission to remove from that place and settle them selves in Karachehdagh, therefore Farraj Allah Khan Shahun was ordered to conduct their movements- Previous to this, however, the command of a body of the ever-victorious troops was given to ^ a J Kuly Khan Kajar, which was to join the othei troops commanded by Mahdy Kuly Khan Kaj' 11 - and proceed to Erivan: besides which, a body 0 the army also received orders to halt in Khoie anDYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 2C)9 Tabreez. It lias been mentioned before^ that Hu- sain Kuly Khan Afshar, and Ismail Khan Kajar, had earnestly requested to be allowed to advance from Erivan, with a force comprised of infantry and ca valry, to the district bordering on Gunjah and Gur- jistan, and thus have an opportunity of rendering some important service in that country. Alexan der Mirza, Waly of Teflis, had also given countless pledges of sincerity, and orders were therefore given to a body of troops to join him: conse quently, the force in attendance upon the victo rious stirrup, which had both seen and felt the severity of winter, and the difficulties experienced in the desert of Badkubeh and Mughan, were in some respect weakened by the performance of so long a march. The reinforcements also, which had been lately ordered by the climate-conquer- jng sovereign to the exalted stirrup of the prince, )ad not yet arrived; so that, on the whole, the Prince had but an inconsiderable force. At this conjuncture, news arrived, that General Tipalsin, Wit h a numerous army, immediately after the losses sustained by the polluted Russians, had been or- ered to Teflis, and had proceeded from thence to arabagh, where he had been joined by the Rus- s jans from Shakaky, Gunjah, and Karabagh, and all 1 e troops in that place, Armenians and others; had collected all his force at Askeran. The rince Viceroy's high spirit taking entire possession ' J him, he moved from Ak Aghlan; and notwith- ^dndmg the smallness of his force, having appointed 'Hied Khan Mukaddam, with a detachment, to270 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. guard the baggage and stores, advanced with rapid step to the area of the field of battle, as far as the station of Khanishin; where the Russians also ar rived, and took up their position on a lofty moun tain. On the arrival of the auspicious retinue, the ever-victorious troops, during two days, performed all the duties of exertion and prowess, hoping that their numerous opponents would descend from the mountain and advance to the field of battle. Fear and terror long prevented them from descending into the plain, until some of them had been made prisoners; when, through the generosity and entreaty of Abul Futtah Khan, the prisoners of Karabagh were set at liberty, and they conveyed this intelli gence to the Russians : ' The victorious (i .e. the ' Persian) champions are far from their magazines, ' and the herbage of the plains is nearly consumed, ' so that the cattle of their army have no forage. ' consequently, the Viceroy's camp is in the greatest ' distress and perplexity.' The Russians, encou raged by these reports, advanced to give battle. In the mean time, the vengeance-breathing arm}) during these two days, from the first rising of the sun's lucid countenance to the moment that the dusky-faced gloom drew the curtains of darkness, incessantly moved, with determined energy, to their enemies' alarm in every direction: at night their vigilance and martial precaution was such, that they continued until morning like stars in the ment, and slumbered not a single moment tor t purpose of repose. When the encounter oi the two armies took place, there was a river near theDYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 27 I Russians; but the ever-victorious troops were, in every quarter, distant from water. In short, the enemy commenced the attack : and then the sharp sabres, like the arched eye-brows of the fair, excited tumult, and shed blood from the heart. The can non thundered in the field of battle, and represented the uproar of the Resurrection previous to the Day of Judgment. On one side a body of Bastam Arabs, on the other the musketeers of Irak from Farahan and Guzaz, rushed forward with such intrepidity to the very muzzles of muskets and cannon, that they scattered in the air showers of blood from the heads and helmets of the foe. The Russians also shewed great promptitude; and deserting the car riages of their guns, grappled hand to hand with the Arabs ; so that the diamond-like poniard caused ,l billowy sea of blood to flow from the jugular veins of the Russians over the plain, whilst the long- ^pering spear rested not from action in abridging the lives of the foe. In short, the infantry and ca- ^Iry of the ever-victorious army shewed such reso lution in the battle, that they made the Russians ose ground, and took many prisoners. At this con juncture, although the Russian General, in order to ^courage and incite his troops, threw on the pound the emperor's picture and his own sword, ail d had also recourse to entreaties and exhortation, 't was all to no effect; for his forces, beinor unable f • * C j 0 maintain their position, ran away from the field battle. The want of water, and the excessive ea t, sensibly affected the victorious army: lest l heret()re some evil consequence might ensue, and ^ le re not appearing any further probable advantage£72 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. in following the Russians, the infantry aiul ca\ali\ were collected, and drawn off in perfect dignity and order. Besides, the provisions and forage, which recruit the body and form the indispensable food of man and beast, could no longer be procured in that place. The Russians fell back on abundant sup plies ; but from Pul Khoda Afreen to the station of Khanishin, the royal troops could not find a single blade of grass, or any kind of forage for the troops; much less either wheat or barley: therefore the Prince Viceroy, in order to wait for the reinforce ments lately commanded to proceed from the Jam- shid-like sovereign's Durbar, marched back to his stores and baggage with the same regularity as when he had set out, and, crossing the bridge, halted at Chesme-i-Hasan Hasain. At that moment arrived the raging lions ot the field of battle, the su duers of heroes in the lists of glory, Husain Khan, Ismail Beg, Hasan Khan, and Aman Allah Khan; who had been despatched from the victorious so^e reign's Durbar (the resource of the world), w ^ troops terrible as the ocean, furious as the i&lt;V » torrent, to join the sublime stirrup of the Viceroy the exalted monarchy. CHAP. LX1T. A CONCISE ACCOUNT OF FRANCE; AND OF MONS. JAUBERT, Till FRENCH ILCHI. T he French State is situated in the west of Km opt - and is exceedingly populous and extenshe. i 528 miles from east to west, and 590 from 1101 1 south. The capital of the French Empire is arK 'DYNASTY OP THE KAJARS, 273 an extremely beautiful aud populous city: it con tains many elegant structures and edifices, manu factories, colleges, schools, fine hotels, and beautiful palaces : the River Sena flows through it, over which they have constructed strong bridges: the population is generally reckoned at 700,000 souls. On the Atlantic and the White Sea (the Mediterra nean) it possesses many commercial towns, where ships resort, and extensive commercial dealings are carried on. In the year of Jesus 1790, the flame of dissension and revolution broke out in this country: by degrees, Louis XVI. was advised, by his numerous relations and friends, to put to death or remove several of the refractory leaders. But shortly after this, the form ol the French Kingly Government was abolished, and the foundation of a Republic was laid. The Republic also under went many changes and revolutions, but continued s ome time : at last, however, the French people selected from all their Generals one named Bona- parteh, who was appointed Bash Consulus (Chief Consul), and fixed on him to restore order in the State and to model the Government. The French force by sea and land was at first very great; but at the commencement of the Revolution many 'aval officers of great ability, on the appearance of troubles and tumults, fled the country: many of them also fell under the powerful grasp of the English State, so that the naval power of the French Empire was greatly reduced. The French, however, Evaded, and joined some of the Continental countries 0 f Europe to their own : they also found means to enter into some of the Indian Islands: but, as the27 t DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. English possessed the supreme authority in many of them, and as their power at sea exceeds that of all Europe, they expelled the French from several of the Indian Islands, and took sovereign possession of them. In France are found mines of various kinds, such as copper, silver, lead, and iron: the soil is well adapted for the growth of herbage: its productions are grain, vines, and fruits. The French divided this kingdom, which they have possessed from ancient times, containing thirty-two govern ments, into eighty-four departments; to enumerate which would be tedious, and by no means conform able to the design of this book. Besides those go vernments and departments, they also annexed many of the adjacent countries to their empire. The year in which the late sovereign was martyred*, on the arrival of the monarch, dignified as Jamshid, at Teheran the capital, there came two persons, sent by the French Government, with the copy of a Treaty which had been made in former times between the empires of France and Iran: it was then ascer tained that the French envoys had come for the purpose of opening the gates of friendship and the renewal of concord; but Hajy Ibrahim Khan, at that time Prime Minister of Iran, on account of the multiplicity of the internal affairs, paid no attention to the external relations of the kingdom, and omit ted to bring the circumstance under the cognisance of the royal council; so that he gave those two persons an answer from himself, and dismissed theni. After that, when Ismail Beg Biyat, as has been * i. c. Aga Muhammed Khan.dynasty of the kajars. 275 before stated, had been ordered to Bagdad, to con cert measures against the Wahhabees, there came to him an individual who exhibited a long Letter in French characters, and who assumed the title, of Ambassador from that Government, and pro ceeded with him to Teheran. As his object was not ascertained, the Persian Ministers looked on his pretensions as mere imposture, and paid him no attention. Some time after, when Napoleon at tained the supreme power, he laid the foundation ot war and hostilities against the Russians; and having appointed Mons. Jaubert to this embassy, despatched him to the Government of Persia, with instructions and messages to this purport:—' This ' rule is universally laid down, that an enemy's ' friend is a foe, and an enemy's foe a friend. I at ' present bear great hostility towards the Russian ' Government, the enemy to that of Persia. The ' English Government also, which, according to the ' tenor of the treaty with the Governor of Hin- ' dustan, should at this moment, when Russia is ' engaged in hostilities against Persia, entertain great enmity against them, professes great friend- ' ship for them. It is therefore advisable, con- ' sidering the violation of treaties on the part of England, to renew the ancient covenants of 'friendship between France and Persia; so that ' the durability of covenants entered into by the ' I rench nation may be evident to all the world ; and that the advantages of this friendship, namely, * the expulsion of the Russians from Gurjistan and ' the territories of Persia, may be equally clear to When Mons. Jaubert arrived at Ba'izid, t 2270 DYNASTY OP THE KAJARS. Mahmud Pasha, governor of that place, on account of the friendship existing between the Othman and Russian States, seized and imprisoned the ambassa dor and his companions : he also confiscated all his property, and put two of his train to death. On hearing this, the Prince Viceroy organized a great force, to set the ambassador at liberty; and, in order to remove all pretexts, despatched a manifesto to Hajy Yusuf Pasha. His excellency, having well considered the results, and looked to the conse quences, immediately sent an order to Mahmud Pasha to set the ambassador at liberty; and having thus procured his liberation, forwarded him, with great attention, to the Durbar, the seat of majesty. The ambassador, on obtaining an interview with the illustrious prince at Ardebil, addressed a communi cation to the Prince Viceroy, and proceeded to the court of the Jamshid-like sovereign; and in the Plain of Sultaniyah obtained the honour of kissing the threshold, exalted as Paradise, of the hall ot audience. When he had communicated his Letters and embassy, he was highly distinguished by the royal munificence and attentions, and obtained leave to return. Mirza Muhammed Raza Cazviny, a noble and accomplished person from Cazvin, and Vizir to his royal highness Prince Muhammed My Mirza, was ordered to accompany him, by way of Islambul, as Ambassador to the French Government. As the sovereign, great as Jamshid, looked tor as sistance to none excepting the pure essence ot the Almighty, his motive in sending the ambassador was merely to observe the rules of courtesy esta blished in the world. The affairs of France, anddynastv of the kajars. 277 their battles against the Russians, shall shortly be mentioned ; and the rays of perusal be reflected on those topics. CHAP. LXII1. AN ACCOUNT OF THE BATTLE BETWEEN THE RUSSIANS AND THEIR FORCES OF KARABAGH, AND ABUL FATAH KHAN; AND OF THE MIGRATION OF THE TRIBES. D uring the halt at Chesmeh-i-Husan-Husain, Farraj Allah Khan Shahun, who had gone to lead away the tribes of Karabagh, reported as follows: That on the return ot the exalted retinue, some ' of the tribes had recourse to various pretexts to delay their migration; and, as I was anxious that ^ their property should not be destroyed by the soldiers, I did not use force against them: on which, agreeably to the representations and soli citations ol Abul Fatah Khan, a corps of mus keteers was appointed to this service, and Farraj Allah Khan, accompanied by Abul Fatah Khan, (( ^parted on it. They were in the act of leading ^ away the tribes, when that of the Jabreel Lu, having privately despatched a messenger to the Russian General, a Russian force, and Jaafer Kuly Aka ol Karabagh, with his allies, immediately appeared, in their aid. The tribe then advanced to tlie vicinity of Kapan, which abounds with dif- passes, high mountains, and wooded hills: a nd the Russian force, and Jaafer Kuly Aka, Wing come up, the Jabreel Lu joined them; a nd, baring the arm from the sleeve of boldness, commenced hostilities with the musketeers. The278 DYNASTY OF THE KA.IARS. ' exchange of death continued from two hours after ' dawn until midday; when the ammunition of ' the musketeers on that expedition failing, some ' were taken prisoners, and others, by fighting or ' flight, conveyed themselves to a place of security. When this account came to the Prince Viceroy, his noble mind was greatly afflicted; and he ordered his majesty's favourite, Ismail Beg, along with Hasan Khan (brother to Husain Khan Kajar), to move in advance with a body of resolute warriors, and drive back the Russians. The Heaven-aided retinue proceeded after them, by way of Aslanduz; which appeared the most advisable route, on account of the abundance of forage. The receipt of this intelli gence threw terror into the Russian General's soul: he therefore posted a number of his men in Fort Panahabad, and, flying with great haste and precipi tation with the remainder to Ganjah, traversed the valley of adversity. This event was reported to the prince's council, when the Heaven-aided retinue had passed the Aras. CHAP. LX1V. AN ACCOUNT OF THE SPLENDID BANNERS BEING DIBECTE1) 1° SHIRWAN. Although it was the resolution of the prince s most noble mind to advance with determined purpose on Ganjah, and, if General Nibalsin should offer hin| battle, then the concealed purposes of the divine w would be apparent as to the destiny ; otherwise the prince designed the affair should terminate in a blockade and the siege of the fort, and that all hisDYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 279 energy should be confined to effect the reduction of it. Now, at the moment when the victorious train had moved by way of Aslanduz, and crossed the Aras, there arrived representations from Shaikh Aly Khan and Husain Kuly Khan, which stated the co-operation of the people of Derbend with the Russians, and the advance of the latter into those regions and confines. At the same time, Pir Kuly Khan Kajar, who had been detached with a force to their assistance, represented that Mustafa Khan Shirwany, whose sentiments by no means corre sponded with his professions, had sent his brother with a large body of infantry and cavalry to the banks of the Kur, and prevented the passage of the Heaven-aided troops. As the chastisement and cor rection of Mustafa Khan Shirwany, and the expul sion of the Russians from Derbend, appeared more important and urgent than the siege of Ganjah, which might be undertaken at any time, the Prince Vice roy therefore turned all his attention to effect the ruin and destruction of Mustafa Khan, and ordered Husain Khan Kajar, Sardar of Khorasan, with the light troops, to move with the greatest expedition in advance of the ever-victorious army: orders were then given, that the waving tresses of the tri umphant standards should follow the advance; and they exhibited such speed in their movements, that a t the instant Husain Khan Kajar, and the other chiefs ordered on this expedition, were crossing the ^ur, the prince of noble qualities had reached the banks of that river. On his arrival, the Shir wan mfantry in that quarter were entirely dispersed; and Husain Khan, passing over with the rapidity of the280 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. wind, stretched forth his arm, like a raging fire, to consume the very rubbish and chaff of that country. He so kindled the devouring blaze of plunder and devastation in every part of that region, that the wealth of most of the Shirwan tribes, with that of the travellers and merchants oi Karabagh, Ganjah, and Shirwan, became the objects of prey and booty. And as some property belonging to the people ot Shakaky and Tabreez, amidst the caravans of Shir wan, had also been plundered, the prince munifi cently gave an equivalent to the proprietors ot it, either from the amply-replenished treasury, or pro cured the restitution of it from the Heaven-aided troops. When Mustafa Khan beheld such calamity fall on him, and a torrent so resistless spreading destruction over the cultivated parts ol his province, he became absorbed in terror and amazement. He approached the door of solicitation and earnest en treaty ; and despatched an agent to the Durbar, the centre of dignity, and, through the medium of the royal Ministers, requested some declaration which might set his mind at ease ; pledging himself, that, on obtaining assurances of safety and friendship, he would evermore walk in the road of servitude, and never again swerve from the paths ot devoted zeal and profound humility. In consequence ot his im portunity, and the entreaty of the Ministers, the Prince Viceroy ordered Najuf Kuly Khan Garusand Farraj Allah Khan Shahun to the Castle ot lit- where, long before this conjuncture, Mustafa Klw 11 and the people of Shirwan, on quitting their foimei abode, had stored up all their wealth and effects. When they came to an interview, the envoys exDYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 281 plained to him the gracious intentions of the noble- minded, benefit-meditating, Feridoon-resembling, Prince Viceroy ; but Mustafa Khan, through weak ness of understanding, was every instant raising doubts, hopping like a bird from branch to branch, and creating difficulties and delays about proceeding to the dignified presence: he could not, in short, perceive the shamelessness of his conduct, that although before this he had advanced to the banks ol the Kur to meet Ahmed Khan, Beglerbeg of Tabreez andMaragah,he had not now the confidence to undertake the journey when the fortunate retinue, by its sojourn there, conferred lustre on the place; but on the contrary, like a bat, chose to flee from the effulgent splendor (endowed with solar energy) of the royal presence. This infatuated man was satis fied with deputing his maternal aunt's son, Muham- ined Aly Beg, to the royal stirrup, in place of en joying himself an interview with the illustrious prince. This conduct caused the Prince Viceroy to cross the Kur, and to advance to Ak Su. On the arrival there of the auspicious train, orders were given to his majesty's favourite, Ismail Beg, with a force selected from the victorious champions of the Faith, to attack and reduce the stronghold of Shiryan, three sides of which are exceedingly Marshy, and the other presents a solidly-constructed fort. None of the former kings had been ever able to reduce or destroy this place; so that even the hand of Nadir Shah Afshar, whose power and c ourage are the theme of every tongue, could never grasp the parapets of its towers. Husain Kuly ^han Kajar, on another quarter, was ordered to282 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. co-operate in the reduction of the place on the side of the marsh; and these two chiefs, haying made a simultaneous assault, obtained possession of that strong fort; on which occasion, boundless carnage and captivity took place. Afterwards, however, pursuant to the Prince Viceroy's commands, they released the prisoners, and gave up great part of their plunder; but the people of the place, with those of Murad Khan, who on the arrival of Husain Kuly Khan Kajar in that country had fallen into his power, in all nearly 6000 families, were removed, and pro ceeded to Mughan. On witnessing this posture ot affairs, Mustafa Khan's confidence being changed into despair, he constituted Selim Khan, governor of Shakaky, the medium of procuring forgiveness tor his offences: he pretended to express a determina tion of departing to the presence ; but, at the same time, was internally meditating other plans for re trieving his condition. Every day he proposed some new arrangement, and by this chicanery and procrastination kept the auspicious train in inac tivity at Ak Su; until Shaikh Aly Khan, who com manded a body of cavalry which was detached from the royal stirrup to the region of Kubbah, in concert with Husain Kuly Khan, governor of Badkobah, and several other chiefs, having obtained the hononr of an interview, requested the prince to turn his attention to the affairs of Derbend, and the oig'W 1 zation of that country and its frontier. During the time the floating tresses of the victorious banners embellished at Ak Su the face of the beauty ot toi* tune and desire, an unfounded confidence in then power and might induced the people of Shirwan toDYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 283 enter into a contest far beyond their resources and strength, so that they who dwelt securely in their abodes never descended from the mountainous range of Fit to the low country : one day, however, Aman Allah Khan had gone with a small body of men as an advanced guard, and these people, on beholding the smallness of his force, were induced to come forward and give him battle: they were all, however, slain or made prisoners, and he re- turned crowned with victory to the ever-triumphant camp. CHAP. LXV. AN ACCOUNT OF PIR KULY KHAN KAJAR AND SHAIKH KULY KHAN BEING ORDERED TO DERUEND ; AND OF THE DEFECTION OF SELIM KHAN SHAKAK'\ , AS WELL AS THE REMOVAL OF HIS APPREHENSIONS. N early at this time the people of Derbend des patched to the seat of majesty, the Durbar of the Prince Viceroy, repeated representations, contain ing innumerable engagements and assurances, and including entreaties to this purport: ' Let the vic- ' torious prince order Shaikh Aly Khan and Hasan Khan of Badkobah, with a body of the tampions of the Faith, to Derbend, that the (( utter annihilation of the Russians may be effected zealous endeavours of these faithful ser- vants.' Agreeably to their petitions, Pir Kuly n. Shaikh Aly Khan, and Hasan Kuly Khan, were ordered to advance on Derbend, where they inght pei haps render some service. In the course 0 i these few days, Mustafa Khan spread a report t uit orders had been issued by the Prince Viceroy 0 Sliest and imprison, along with several of his284 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. tribe, Muhammed Hasan Khan, brother to Selim Khan, who by the deceased sovereign's order, in the year in which he marched to Karabagh, had been deprived of sight through the agency of Mus tafa Khan Davalu Kajar ; and also, that the prince had issued his commands for the chastisement of Selim Khan himself. Through his simplicity, Selim Khan, attaching credit to this report, sent his tribe and family to a mountain called Kulah San Kursan ; and having despatched a person to the imperial stirrup, used every effort to procure se curity for himself. The Prince Viceroy, in exces sive anger at such a display of opposition, had at first, without further consideration, determined on the plan of destroying the foundation of his ex istence : through the requests and entreaties of the nobles however, and also calling to mind his former, services, he ordered the Vizir's son, the honoured Mirza Abul Kasimf, to remove his ap prehensions. The envoy found him in the town of Shakaky, and with the pure water of friendly admonition washed away the dust of suspicion from the page of his soul. In return for this important benefit, he pledged himself, without causing further trouble to the champions of the Faith, to get Mus tafa Khan into his power, either by persuasion or force. At this period a great sickness prevailed in the prince's camp at Ak Su, caused by the corrupt state of the atmosphere; the complexion of most of the troops became of a saffron hue; and their erect stature, through weakness and disease, as sumed the form of bruised reeds. * Mirza Bazurg's son.dynasty of the kajars. 285 CHAP. LXVL AN ACCOUNT OF SOME COMBINED CAUSES WHICH OBLIGED THE FORTUNATE RETINUE TO RETURN FROM SHIRVAN. W hen the Prince Viceroy had departed from Tehe ran the (seat of Government), among the many im portant tasks assigned and entrusted to his clear reflection and far-seeing prudence, one was, the power to dismiss and appoint the Governors of Azarba'ijan, and to definitively arrange every affair of the limits and frontier on that side of the empire. As the exalted Nawab's* realm-adorning prudence judged Ahmed Khan, Beglerbeg of Tabreez and Maragah, more suitable than Mahdy Kuly Khan Kajar for promoting the views of Government and executing the measures appointed for Erivan, and as, previous to this, a royal firman, powerful as destiny, had been issued forth, with due distinction, to the same purport, Mahdy Kuly Khan was, in consequence, deprived of the government, and Ahmed Khan appointed in his place. Ahmed Khan proceeded from Tabreez to Erivan, accompanied by a numerous force of cavalry and infantry ; and, im mediately on his arrival in that territory, devoted wnaself to putting in repair the bastions and cur tains of the fort, as well as introducing order ln to all the concerns of the military and civil de partments. But at this time, through the pesti- ei 'ous state of the atmosphere, a plague had broken 0l jt in the province; so that, besides numbers of the ^habitants, nearly sixteen hundred of the cavalry 1111(1 ln tantry detached on this expedition departed t The proper sense of Navvab is Deputy.286 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. for the other world, Ahmed Khan himself was so violently attacked by the disease, that he was reduced to extremity; and hence the affairs of Erivan fell into confusion, and every thing concern ing them was neglected. When this intelligence reached the camp, it occasioned great affliction to the prince's gracious mind; for Ahmed was one of the most eminent and trustworthy servants. The Russians of Pambak and Gurjistan were posted in hostile ambush, watching a favourable opportunity; as the affairs of Nakhshiwan were in utter con fusion, through the hostility of Kelb Aly Khan, and his cousin. Abbas Kuly Khan. News also arrived from the royal Durbar, that whilst the Kibleh of the world and mankind designed to re-establish Abd-ur-rahmin Pasha in the government of Baban, Aly Pasha, Waly of Bagdad, had moved from Bag dad, and crossed the frontier, with the intention of breaking the existing treaties and covenants, and exciting the dust of enmity and discord between the two mighty empires of Iran and Room: news like wise arrived from Urumia, that the son of Husain Kuly Khan Afshar, and Mustafa Khan, governor of Kukary, had commenced hostilities. Although, con sidering the disturbed state of affairs at Bagdad, an the violence and folly of Aly Pasha, some confusion might have been expected to happen on the Kurdish frontier, yet as this, at the time of the Prince Roya - setting out on his expedition could not be certain y known, proper attention was not paid to putting frontier towards Turkey in a proper state of defence, nor to secure the passes on that border. Ph K 11 ) Khan also represented, that the measures proposedynasty of the kajars. 287 by the people of Derbend, by the guidance of the Russians, were hatched in fraud and treachery ; and that Shaikh Aly Khan, intoxicated with the wine of self-conceit, had discarded all attention to State affairs, and abandoned all care of military concerns : so that, in this posture of affairs, Pir Kuly Khan had set out on his return to Juwad, by way of Bakoa ; and that therefore the period of the arrival of re inforcements (if sent), and that of the hosts of win ter, would be the same. The Prince Viceroy, con sidering these circumstances, deferred the expedi tion to Erivan, and ordered the army to move from Ak Su: and Mustafa Khan, from weakness of in tellect, shortly after this movement of the exalted arm y, marched a numerous body of men to the site of the royal encampment. The Prince Vice- joy by chance had left a body of the heroic Ghoo- ams, under Hasan Khan Kajar, as a rear-guard; hey encountered this force of Mustafa Khan's, and, a g on them like some sudden plague, soon be reft their general, Malek Makem, of his existence; bus depriving him, at once, of the vital principle and he power of governing*: and such became the for- u ne of many others. They made many prisoners; J J hose who escaped slaughter or capture wan ted heedlessly in the regions of adversity. Pir 11 y Khan was ordered to Mughan with a detach ment of the vengeance-breathing army; and with mstructions to halt there, if he thought it advisable; 0 * otherwise to remove the people of Shirwan,' , and Mughan, and proceed to Taulish.

CHAP. LXV11. an account of the criminal movements of mustafa khan SHIRWANY, AFTER THE DEPARTURE OF THE ROYAL RETINUE. HIS ENGAGEMENT WITH PIR KULY KHAN ; AND HIS DEFEAT. While Mustafa Khan pretended to avail himself ot the intercession of Selim Khan Shakaky, lie secretly laid the foundations of a treaty with the Russians of Ganjah, thus obstinately persevering in his de sign of introducing that nation into Shirwan. But now the Russians, through fear of the royal armies, sheltered themselves in the secluded recesses ot Ganjah, and were entirely engaged in watching and taking care of themselves ; so that they made this excuse : ' That if Mustafa Khan would send proper ' hostages to Ganjah, his wishes should be com- ' plied with.' Mustafa Khan declined doing tins; but ceased not from using perseverance and impor tunity, and the Russians then assigned to him this excuse : 'We have submitted the proposition o « Godovitch, who is in Kezlar; and we expect Ins ' answer.' Notwithstanding this, on the departure of the victorious retinue, when Mustafa Khan re pented of his criminal conduct, and no longer e disposed to introduce the Russians, but, on tie contrary, cordially detested them, then, on seeing the country evacuated, they suddenly enteied i wan. However, Mustafa Khan, being engaged u hostilities with the people of Sali'an, Taulish, a' 1DYNASTY OP THE KAJARS. 2^9 their allies, consoled himself with the idea, that through the Russian aid lie should enter Shirwan still, and bring Sali'an under his power, which he had for years been desirous of effecting; and that moreover, it was possible he might at the same' time bring back several of the tribes, in obedience to him, from Shirwan to Mughan. He entertained, owever, great apprehension from the continuance ofPir Kuly Khan on the banks of the Kur, and the residence of Mir Bakir Beg, brother to Mustafa Khan Taulish, in Sali'an, and that of Husain Kuly Khan m Badkou, until he was informed that Husain uy Khan, on hearing of the return to those parts of the victorious standard, had, through fear and alarm, removed with his people and household, and was proceeding, by way of Sali'an, to the Prince iceioy s piesence. At this conjuncture, a Russian commander, named Bulghakif, seeing Badkou eva- | cuatcc, unmolested by the thorns of rivals, opened js udget in that thornless rose-garden; while Aaikh Aly Khan, in a state of infatuation, was e gociating in a vague and confused manner at a s ance, accounting a few days' enjoyment great ^ ]•&gt; n rnariner &gt; some ol the people of a i an from enmity to their governor.

On this, Mustafa Khan Shirwany, at night fall, when the pitch-complexioned Hindoo of the skies scatters about the cinders of darkness, and the hand of Destiny places the diamond-studded neck laces on the neck of the Ahriman of the spheie, planned a nocturnal attack on Pir Kuly Khans army: he contrived to spread dismay among the tribes about to emigrate, which caused great per plexity and agitation among them. Pir Kuly Khan exhibited on this occasion every demonstration of bravery; and having, at the commencement of the engagement, firmly maintained his ground, he after wards charged and gave his enemy a considerable defeat, continuing the pursuit of him as far as the Kur: after which he conducted the tribes to Taulish, and returned to Karachehdagh.

Now it did somehow or other happen, thcit the Lezghee troops were dispersed by the violent cannonade of the Russians, while Selim was en gaged in battle ; and the people of Shakaki, seeing this, took to flight, with desponding hearts and blanched cheeks. Selim Khan, from puie necessity, quitted the field of battle, took with him his people, household, relations, and dependants, and turned the face of hope to the court of the sovereign who protects the unfortunate. During his journey, he had several spirited skirmishes with the Ptussians and their allies; but was able to cross the Kur; and proceeding by way of Ardebil, in company with Farraj Allah Khan Shahun, procured himself the honour of appearing in the dignified presence of the exalted prince, at Tabreez, the seat of Government. At this interview he was distinguished by royal mu nificence; and received orders from the Prince Vice roy, that himself, his household, and his people, should reside in Ardebil, until, by God's assistance, and the influence of the royal fortune, his affairs (it such were the will of God) should be brought to a favourable termination.

However, Mustafa Khan Taulish acted very differently from Mustafa Khan Shirwany; and from his exceeding loyalty and good faith, setting no value on the life of his brother and three hundred other individuals, sent back a reso lute answer, and devoted himself to the strengthen ing and increasing of his own resources. He also reported to the illustrious prince the tenor of the propositions made by the Russians, and the answer lie gave to them. CHAP. LXX.

Under these circumstances, it was suddenly announced from one quarter, that Graf (Count) Godovitch, one of the most distin guished Ministers of the Russian Empire, celebrated for his universal knowledge and talents lor conduct ing affairs, and who had often experienced the smiles and frowns of Fortune, was appointed Com mander of the Russian forces, in place of General Zizianof, commonly called Ashpukhdar; and that he had now come from Kazlar to Teflis with a nu merous force, for the purpose of exciting commo tion in Erivan; whilst not only Ahmed Khan, the new Beglerbeg of that region, was struggling with death from the attack of a host of diseases, but the army appointed to defend the fort laboured under great sickness from the corrupted state of the atmosphere; and the inhabitants, from all these circumstances, were thrown into the greatest per plexity. It was also reported from another quarter, t ia the Russians of Karabagh having advanced to T a • were preparing to renew hostilities against Ahme Khan, Abul Faty Khan, and the tribes ot that re gion : also, that the Pashas of Kars and Ba'iM having laid the foundations of perfect conceit ^ ltl the Russians, had formed the design of circunnent ing the Subky and Zilan tribes inhabiting Ei^ a11 Under such circumstances, the Prince Viceroy pl acu his reliance on the Divine mercy; and recommending himself to the protection of the glorious Proph^DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 29.J confided in the efficacy of his exalted majesty's auspicious fortune, and did not permit the changes and chances which occur in this transitory and cor rupt world to sully his royal vesture with the dust of alarm. He appointed Husain Khan Kajar Sardar* governor of Erivan, and furnished him with a re solute force of infantry and cavalry, and every thing proper for the civil and military government of the province; so that the settlement of affairs in that country, and the measures of precaution in regard to the Pashas of Kars and Ba'izid, were confided to him. He also received instructions to send Ahmed Khan in a litter to Tabreez, whatever might be his state; and Pir Kuly Khan was also detached to the assistance of Mustafa Khan Taulish: whilst another detachment, under the command of a distinguished Ghoolam, was sent to aid Abul Faty Khan. As the Russians had repeatedly witnessed the bravery of these troops, they were afraid to meet them; and on the mere announcement of Husain Khan Sardar's arrival in Erivan, Godo- vitch resigned all thoughts of meddling with that country, and revoked his previous arrangements. The Commandant or Boulouknech also, on learn- ln g the circumstance of Pir Kuly Khan's arrival at the verge of the Mughan steppe, no longer dared to meet him, but fled with precipitation ; and a fter halting a few days in Shirwan, hastily quitted it, to return to Ganjah.

The Russians from Shakaki, who were greatly encouraged by Selim Khan's defeat, and had advanced to Jarotulla, on ascertaining Pir Kuly Khan's appointment, set out immediately on their return. At this conjuncture, the Lezghees, along with other allies and associates of Selim Khan who were stationed in Jar, as the Russians were unable to return by the road of Avar and Jan Ku- ta'iy, which was blocked up by snow, fought many severe battles against them; and finally, great numbers of the Russians being slain, the remainder fled in great confusion to Shakaki. A considerable force of infantry and cavalry, terrible as the ocean and stable as mountains, having arrived in Azar- ba'ijan, from the Durbar exalted as heaven, some ot Husain Khan's regiments were ordered to Erivan; and the remainder marched to Mughan, to reinforce Pir Kuly Khan. The Prince Viceroy, who was at Tabreez (the seat of Government), carefully re viewed the state of the army, and directed all his energies to procure funds requisite for the payment and reward of the cavalry and infantry of the Heaven-aided host; and also passed much time in making due preparations and arrangements lor their march.

The Rus sians, witnessing such measures, and being well acquainted with the fact that the devoted hosts of the victorious prince and the troops distinguished by triumph were not to be arrested by winter; and knowing-also, that so perfect was their allegiance to the eternal empire, that they viewed as things indifferent, heat or cold, peace or war, wounds or repose, blows of the sword or silken robes, the day of battle or the night of dalliance with the cypress -formed damsels; that they esteemed the heads of their enemies as the best balls, and the Wood of their foes sweeter than the sugared draught of the morning *; became overwhelmed in the dreadful abyss of terror and alarm, and commenced negociations, desiring to open the door of peace and friendly counsel. Count Godovitch there fore, pursuant to the Russian Emperor's order, des patched his Ishak Akasy, by name Istifanoft, to the Durbar of the King of kings, magnificent as Jamshid, charging him with a Letter addressed to the Prime- minister of the exalted State, Mirza Muhammed With military men in Persia, who are generally debauchees dn d hard livers, and therefore tolerably feverish in the morning, it ls Usua ^ ^ commence the day with a sherbet, cooled either with ice 0r snow. ^ From the name, I conjecture this to have been an Armenian, ,la| ned Stephanoos.298 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS.

The above-mentioned Istifanof, on his way, obtained the honour of an interview with the Prince-royal at Tabreez, the seat of Government; and having re ceived presents and distinctions suitable to his rank, proceeded to Teheran, the capital,'to kiss the threshold of the unequalled monarch's splendid court.

Speaking of Luzan's Criticism on a Sonnet of Gongora, my Lord says. The Reader will there find that ' the pen of the Historian opens the gates of Memory' and that ' Memory stamps shadows on mounds of foam.' ' By ' these expressions, Gongora means to give a poetical description ' of the art of writing on paper.' I am not sufficiently acquainted with the Spanish language to know whether these expressions are idiomatical, or whether they ought to be considered as an impres sion which the Arabic has left on the Spanish idiom. However, I have no doubt my Readers w ill agree with me, that Lord Holland's remarks on several Spanish writers of this class are equally appli cable to Persian authors. ' These authors do not avail themselves ' of the invention of letters for the purpose of conveying, but con- ' cealing their ideas. The art of writing reduces itself with them ' to the talent of perplexing and puzzling; and they require in ' their readers a degree of ingenuity at least equal to their own.' I am also apprehensive the Reader, before he arrives at this page has more than once exclaimed, ' Si non vis intelligi, non debes legi.' Hie Reader has been told, that a play on words is frequently used 1Q the original Persian Text: he will find this also considered as a beauty300 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. and war ; which, though he admitted them to be ex tremely reprehensible, he nevertheless put himself forward to excuse, and to solicit the liberation of Suleiman Pasha, Aly Pasha's Khiah. He therefore sent to the Prince Viceroy's court Muhammed Feiz Allah Effendy, one of his chamberlains, who was adorned with the graces of perfection, and decorated with great eloquence of speech and sweetness of language; and by this person he formally pledged himself, ' that from henceforth no Pasha of the borders or frontier should commit any act opposed ' to the friendship existing between the two States and, moreover, to prove the extent of the desire entertained by the Ozmanlees, to cultivate the irood-will of Persia, he stated that ' the Turks were ' willing to break off their friendship with the beauty in Spanish. Thus in Lope's scarce Play of La Estrella de Sevilla: ' Pues por ellas ' Atropellan las Estrellas.' And again: ' Esta ha Sido Teodora Estrella mia?' and, ' Esta amigos ha Sldo Estrella mia.' And Estrella ends a speech with ' Esta ha Sido Teodora Estrella mia ?' Having mentioned idioms, I may as well remark, there is ^ figure of reproof constantly in the mouth of the king and the peasant, in Persia, which is extremely offensive to the ear of an European ; and is of itself of the most coarse, vulgar, and in( e 1 cate nature—' Goh Khoordie—Stercus edisti.'

The Prince Viceroy, in consequence, represented these circumstances to his majesty (the shadow of the Almighty) ; and the excuse-accepting sovereign, overlooking the past actions of the Turks, ratified an arrangement, to the following purport: ' That for the future, neither ' the Prince Viceroy nor Prince Muhammed Aly ' Mirza * shall, in any manner, practise aggression ' towards the governors of the Othman frontier.' Suleiman Pasha Khiah was restored to liberty, ob tained the great distinction of the Calaat, and afterwards set out for Bagdad (the seat of peace). Sultan Selim, the Othman Emperor, being made acquainted with what was done, ratified these en gagements, and immediately set about breaking up the foundations of the amity which was subsisting between himself and the Russians. In consequence of this, in all the frontier provinces of the Othman State the preparations for hostility and war with * Who held the government of Hamadan on the Kurdish frontier.302 dynasty of the kajars.

On his arrival in that country he obtained favours and respect beyond all bound; and by ad hering to the path of mutual good-will and the principles of peace, he laid the bases of concord between the two empires, and then returned to the prince.

A SUMMARY ACCOUNT OF THE BATTLES AND CONTESTS OF NAPOLEON THE GREAT, THE FRENCH EMPEROR, WITH THE RUSSIANS; IN WHICH THE FRENCH ARMY GAIN THE VICTORY, AND NAPOLEON GRANTS THE RUSSIANS A PEACE. O n the departure from the royal camp of Monsieur Joubert, the French envoy, he was accompanied, on his return to France by way of Islamboul, by Mirza Muhammed Raza. Now Monsieur Jouannin* came on the part of the French Government; and having obtained the honour of an audience with the Prince Viceroy at Tabreez, he proceeded to the imperial court, and was admitted to reside at the sublime threshold ; where he frequently received news from Europe, which he hastened to commu nicate to the Ministers of the splendid sanctuary. Both of these gentlemen, Joubert and Jouannin, were excellent and accomplished Persian scholars, and, as I found to my cost and trouble, admirably calculated to fulfil the business on which they were despatched from France.DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 303 Besides this. Monsieur Rousseau f and Monsieur Yusuf Rousseau, Consuls at Haleb and Bagdad, re peatedly submitted to the Prince Viceroy correct statements of European news. According to the information given by them, the state of events, and t The elder Rousseau had been French Consul at Bussorah for some years; but as the trade of France to that port was entirely ruined during the American War—and as, after the seizure of Du Bourg and his packets at Grain, by Mr. Abraham, it was evident the French had no chance of transmitting safely their despatches to India across the Desert from Aleppo — Mons. Rousseau retired to Bagdad, where, some years before, he had married an Arme nian lady. In 1798 I found him there; and when, in conse quence of the battle of Aboukir, an order came to the Pasha to send him and his family to Constantinople, he besought my interfe rence with the Pasha, to mitigate as far as possible the severity of the order. Whilst he remained at Bagdad, I got the Pasha to allow him to remain in his own house, under the care of a Turkish officer. The order was, to confiscate and sell his goods, and to imprison him and his family in the common prison, until they commenced their journey. I contrived to protract this period so long, that the old gentleman, his wife, and son, were permitted to proceed with tolerable comfort to Aleppo, instead of being dragged to Constantinople. His son Joseph was, at the peace between France and the Porte, nominated French Consul at Aleppo. The elder Rousseau, during his Consulate at Bagdad, frequently forgot what was due to his situation : the consequence was, that every thing coming to him from France was stopped at the Custom house and opened. It so happened, that a box addressed to him, containing wigs, and bags appended to them, was carried before the famous Ahmed Khiah. As ' With care, and to be kept dry ' was written on the outside of the box, the Khiah, when this was read and translated to him, naturally concluded the box contained something curious and valuable. When the wigs were discovered, they were articles the Turks at Bagdad had never seen before, and consequently had no idea of their use: however, they conceived what was valuable might be concealed in the bag, which they therefore untied and opened, and were still more surprised to find it contained nothing but hair. The Consul himself was sent for ; and on his arrival, to his astonishment, he found his wigs all in disorder, and he was desired to declare their use; which having doneDYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. of the successes gained by the French, was after this manner. When the people of France chose Buonaparte for their king, the Emperor of Germany was requested, according to the custom of Europe, to confirm his sovereignty: but as that monarch withheld his assent, discussion and disputes took place between France and Germany. Many consi derable battles were fought; and in some of these engagements, the Russians hastened to assist the German Emperor; but, notwithstanding the numbers and importance of their combined hosts, Buonaparte always proved victorious ; the Russian and German armies fled; and a great multitude of men on both sides was destroyed. The French elevated the standard of victory; so that peace was at last con cluded between the French and Russians. CHAP. LXXII1.

This afforded so much amusement (as the Consul wore the Turkish dress) to the Khiah and his friends, that he thought it a pity the old Pasha should be deprived of such a spectacle; and the Consul was desired to shew himself to the old man, who, after entertaining' himself for some time, exclaimed— 'Aid Giddee mascara!' 'Oh! brave Master Mountebank !'DYNASTV OF THE KAJARS. 305 communications ; from which it appeared, ' that the ' Othman Emperor had despatched Husain Pasha, ' the Capudan Pasha, and Bazu Band Oghly, with ' other commanders, accompanied by forces terrible ' as the ocean, towards Bulgharan, Dilwar, and Ir- ' shova; and these different chiefs had conducted their ' operations with such zeal, that in whatever quarter ' they severally displayed the standard of holy war, ' they entirely subdued that country, with great ' slaughter and discomfiture of the Russians. They ' also captured, and sent to Istambul, six of their ' ships of war, and all their crews, who with their u fire-vomiting guns had consumed the lives of ' many True Believers. Besides this, after an ob- &lt;f stinate resistance, they rescued from the grasp of ' Russian usurpation two cities, named Kiel Barun ' andOuza.' At this time, a person named Estefan*, a respectable inhabitant of Teflis, came, on the part of Godovitch, to the Prince-Viceroy's dignified pre sence, and renewed his solicitations for establishing the foundations of peace. Godovitch entreated per mission for Estefan to proceed to the supreme sovereign's court, in order that the Ministers of the kingdom (daily increasing in prosperity) might, if t ' le y thought proper, turn to measures of peace. In P r osecution of this object, Godovitch, in his me morials, had recourse to the most urgent solicitations, ^ re presented as follows: ' That though to the fortunate and triumphant prince the garlands of conquest may at first give delight, especially in that season when the branches of life are verdant and the plant of Fortune and Prosperity puts forth * Evidently the Armenian Stephanoos.300 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS.

On his arriving at the Durbar of the supreme monarch, powerful as Kai Khosrau, a treaty of peace was set tled, on this condition : ' That the Russians should ' evacuate the countries belonging to Iran, over ' which they had usurped the power.' The Rus sian envoy was then permitted to return. CHAP. LXXIV. AN ACCOUNT OF THE MOTIVES FOR INTRODUCING THE NIZAM-E- JEDEED, OR NEW SYSTEM ; AND OF THE PRINCIPLES ON WHICH IT IS FOUNDED. T hose who sit under the shade of this inland dome and vaulted pavilion, and are directors of human affairs and administrators of the general interests, the calculators of numbers on this tablet of dust, and the measurers of the motions of the fixed stars and planets in the heavens, have ascertained, from continued observations of events, and from meditations on histories and records, that, in the time of the world - illuminating splendor, oi the moon of the prophetic shrine, of the king endued with supreme power of decision, the Prophet o * The English reader even will easily see this to be a second Persian edition of Godovitch's despatch.DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 307 Arabiaf, (on whom be benedictions!) placed the order of orthodox warfare according to this text: ' Those who fight in the way of God in a body, resemble a firm foundation since, in the partnership of battle and contest, the skirts of the zealous champions ought to be so at tached to each other, that their flaming swords mow down the harvest of opposing hosts, and render the line of battle, in regularity and beauty, like the order of prayer: ' Locked rank in rank, mountains recede from them ; ' And the concert and regularity of their line of battle ' Is as pleasing to behold as the constellations of the Heavens.' It was by such rules and principles that the or thodox armies in a short time overthrew the neigh bouring sovereigns, trampled on their prostrate realms, and caused to circulate in the channel of the world the stream of Tradition and Faith derived from the pure fountain of truth and certainty, pouring out the illumination of true belief into the hearts of all, whether near or remote, Turk or Tq/'i/t-. When the sun of prophetic existence had arrived at the period of setting, the same system was long maintained: but afterwards, in the revo lution of ages, weakness and languor creeping in by degrees, the connection of this discipline and ar rangement was snapt asunder; and as the doctors of the law, through religious discord, had not power from time to time to restore every thing to the ancient model, so those possessed of power found it impossible, at the commencement of innovation, to restore the long-received discipline. It must not + Muhammed. x 2308 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS, be concealed, that the armies of the True Believers became in time intoxicated with the wine of pride, and, from want of zeal in their commanders and generals, their ancient mode of warfare was entirely lost sight of; firmness and concert in battle were abandoned, each one claiming the supremacy over the other; and in this manner, when in action, they altogether neglected mutual support and com bined efforts. By degrees, the good system of the Believers was transferred from them into Europe, and became confined to the Frank nations; until the Prince-Viceroy's penetrating mind discerned the Fringee tactics to be the same as those ordained by the glorious Prophet in the admirable Koran. A book on the science of war*, composed by Muliam- med Mansur Said, in the time of Hantmish Khan, having fallen under his gracious sight, it became evident to him that the lines of infantry, with arms and archers, resembled the walls of fortresses; that the fighting-men, called in the Fringee lan guage ' Soldat,' are at present styled, with us, ' Jan- Bazf;' the chief commander of every division, styled in Europe ' General' or ' Yeneral,' is called ' Sarhang;' resolute men of strong frames are the ' Bargezideh;' and that young men ot low * This book I have never seen; and I regret not knowing of the work whilst I was in Persia. It seems odd, that, to the best of nn recollection, neither Mirza Bazurg nor the prince should hau' mentioned to me from whence they borrowed the idea of adopting European tactics; but, in all our various conversations on this subject, left me to suppose that the credit lay in the representa tions made to them by the French Gentlemen, and perhaps some thing in the reports their agents made to them of the proceeding''' of Sultan Selim at Constantinople. + ' Jan-Baz,' devoting or playing with their lives &amp;c.DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 309 stature, who are outside the camp as advanced guards and pickets, are denominated Munhyan.' But the arms of that period were, arrows, swords, clubs, hatchets, iron maces, large daggers; and the use of musketry was not generally practised until the time of the venerable Muhammed Husain Vaiz, who, through his abundant knowledge, employed it in the reign of Sultan Husain Mirza Bayakara. It is in like manner perfectly evident to persons of discriminating reflection, that as Sultan Husain iMirza Bayakara neglected to attend to the state of his army, and passed his time with poets and in useless pursuits J, the cord, on which this lucid order was strung in the times of the orthodox sovereigns, had snapped asunder. Shah Ismail Sefavy also, when he appeared, collected a considerable body of men: for though the people of Iran are naturally high-minded and ardent, they had become discou raged and despondent on seeing the ancient prin ciples of tactics abandoned, and expressed a desire to possess a martial sovereign, who would restore order, resolution, and energy amongst the troops : they esteemed therefore the appearance of Shah Ismail a blessing; and, on beholding the proofs he gave of heroism, prowess, high-mindedness, bravery, a nd activity, exposed themselves for his sake, and rushed to the flames of hostile encounter like moths to a candle; always regarding the completion of his desire as the source of happiness and delight; so t This is the first instance I recollect of poetry being spoken of 80 slightingly in Persia ; and T doubt whether this passage passed 'nder the eye of the kin^, who prides himself much on his poetic vein.310 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. that, to persons thus actuated, every object was at tainable, and for men so devoted no principles of war were necessary. When Shah Ismail first ap peared at the village of Min Jewan, in the district of Nakhohiman, a thousand such devoted youths were in his train : and the Shah happening one day to be on the banks of the Aras, in order to prove the obedience and devotion of his brave followers, and to try to what pitch their courage mounted, threw his whip into the rapid and deep stream: the whole of these persons, regardless altogether of risk, rushed into the river, and brought out the whip. Thus the system of successive ages was at once departed from, and is at present only uniformly practised in Europe. According to the maxim, ' Every thing has a tendency to return to its ori ginal state,' it follows, therefore, that in this king dom the ancient institutions having been established with the consent and by the desire ot the people ot Iran, the apparently new order ol battle and the rules of war should be much and generally wished for amongst the same people. The consideration of this matter having been frequently pressed on the Council at the royal Durbar, the consequence was, that supreme decrees and exalted orders were issued to the Governors of the different districts o Azarba'ijan, to assemble and levy, in every part ot the province, brave youths for this service; and also to equip and train them according to the appi' ou ^ ancient, and orthodox manner. It was like^ ise regulated, that money, for their pay, provisions clothing, and all other necessaries, should be regu larly issued from the Government funds; so that,DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 311 thus, this acceptable ordinance of the law was everywhere established and promulgated; and, from the auspicious and sublime royal energies, joined to the exalted Prince-Viceroy's system of disci pline, the inhabitants of these regions now learnt a settled system of repelling their foes, and ren dering due service to the Eternal Empire; and from hence cast away all solicitude and anxiety about the greater or smaller numbers of their enemy*.

The victorious prince at first selected a considerable body of soldiers to learn the use of the musket; and set over them instructors well versed in the manual exercise, to teach them the management of those arms which are employed in battle : and if, on moving or halting, they made a single step contrary to rule and precept, the instructive wand of their teachers was not sparingly made use of, for their benefit, and to set them to rights. The Prince Vice roy himself frequently deigned to exhibit his august presence at the place of instruction, and manoeuvred these men according to the proper rules and pro portions : and whenever the conduct of any indi vidual, either for activity or docility, obtained the high meed of royal approbation, the prince pro moted him on the spot, in the presence of his com panions and equals, and accompanied his promotion by donations and distinctions. In like manner, se veral youths remarkable for sagacity and talent, chosen from the respectable families of the country, were selected to learn mathematics, military archi tecture, and to make themselves acquainted with the theory of war, fortification, and tactics. Mon sieur L'Ami, a Frenchman, an ingenious mathema tician and a profound philosopher, was honoured by receiving an exalted firman, directing him to at tend to the education of these youths, and to rentlei' them in a short time masters of all those sciences^. * It seems the Persians think there is a royal road to Geometry.DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS.

Again the revolving globe of the bright sun, by the changes of the celestial revolutions, made the por ticoes of Aries the abode of his royal train. The vernal clouds, agitated by the April gales, spread their argent canopy over the new-rising plants of the garden; and the innumerable hosts of herbs and sweet-scented plants embellished the Irem- resembling J surface of the earth. The vegetable host shot up their thin javelin and dagger-shaped blades through the bosom of the black mould; and the chamberlains of Spring erected, on the summit of hills and mountains, red and white pavilions, orna mented with the blushing white rose and the deep- fed tulip.

He expanded his gold-scattering hands, and showered down dirhems and dinars with boundless munificence: he exalted the dignity and power of his Nobles, Ministers, and Warriors to the zenith of Heaven: and this auspicious festival terminated, he directed his energies to the concerns of government. At the end of the month of Muharram-ul-Haram, the secret agents of the Court despatched intelligence, that the Great Empe ror, the sovereign of France, being exceedingly in tent on the plan of reducing the power of the Rus sians, had, from his anxiety to accomplish this great object and daring enterprise, banished rest and re pose from the sanctuary of his breast; and that during the winter he had not put his army into winter-quarters, but passed the cold season in the kingdom of Lah * and Moisheh f, and collected a countless host from the countries immediately de pendent on him; receiving levies also fromNamsah + , ' third year of his reign, he made a feast unto all his princes and ' his servants; the power of Persia and Media, the nobles au ' princes of the provinces, being before him ; when he shewed t e ' riches of his glorious kingdom, and the honour of his excellent ' majesty, many days, even an hundred and fourscore days.

Intelligence also ar rived, that an English fleet came to the Boghaz of Ak Dengizf, with an intention to pass through and enter the Sea of Marmora, which is a small sea between the Boghaz of Ak Dengiz and that of Kara Dengiz || ; and having passed the latter, their object was to proceed to Kara Dengiz J, to excite commotion and insurrection. The Othman Govern ment had stationed eight ships, completely equipped, in the middle of the Boghaz of Ak Dengiz; and on each side of the Boghaz there were forts, on which the Turks had placed many heavy guns, to prevent the English passing through. But the English ar mament, consisting of fifteen ships of war, unani mously pushing forward with extreme rapidity, en tered the Boghaz of Ak Dengiz, i. e. the Dardanelles, notwithstanding the gunners stationed in the forts on both sides showered down fire and cannon-balls on them: from this, however, the English ships sustained no damage, but burnt and sunk the eight ships of war stationed by the Turks in the middle of the Boghaz; and having passed through, they entered the Sea of Marmora: they then cast anchor at four parasangs from Istambul, near the Island of Haibat Luff. As soon as this circumstance was communicated to Sultan Selim, the Emperor of Room, the Janissaries and people of Istambul, nearly 200,000 persons or more, issued forth from Prussia. f The Dardanelles.

They collected cannon and mortars; and a number of the Janissaries went to the Island of Haibat f for the purpose of giving bat tle to the English, and took some of them prisoners. As the English were unable to advance further, they returned by the way they came : and, on their de parture, it was reported to the Sultan Selim, that the return of the English was effected through the weakness and negligence of the Capudan Basha, who had been raised to the dignity of Darya Beg J by the Sultan himself; who, on this account, de posed him. CHAP. LXXVI. AN ACCOUNT OF THE HOSTILITIES WHICH OCCURRED BETWEEN THE PASHAS OF THE OTHMAN FRONTIER AND THE RUSSIANS; AND HOW THE DUST OF BATTLE AND CONTEST WAS EXCITED AMONGST THEM. As at this period the Russians purchased with gold their provisions and other necessaries in the districts of Ba'izid and Van, which were under the controul of Yusuf Pasha, and as the desire of his heart and the object of his mind was to give satisfaction to his exalted majesty (the shadow of God) and to con ciliate the good graces of the vicegerent of tempo ral and spiritual power, he was anxious therefore, m the administration of his government, to promote the concord subsisting between the empires of In 111 and Room, and to prevent any thing occurring, 011 * Scutari. t Prince's Island. + Lord of the Sea.DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 317 his part, detrimental to this principle. This inter course of the Russians, therefore, with the people of Ba'izid and Van was contrary to the world-sub duing reason of the King of kings ; and orders and intimations to this purpose, to Yusuf Pasha§, ema nated from the exalted majesty of the Prince Vice roy ; that is to say: ' If you pretend to sincere ' friendship with Iran, it is necessary to give up all ' such transactions with the Russians in the above ' districts : it is incumbent on you to be, to your &lt;f friends, genial as the April showers are to the ' rose-garden, and blasting to your malignant foes as ' the lightning is to the harvest.' After this, Yusuf Pasha despatched positive orders to the frontier- Pashas dependent on his authority, to abandon all intercourse with the Russians ; at the same time threatening them with punishment if they carried on any dealings or connections with that odious people, and particularly prohibiting them to afford supplies of provisions of every description. Godo- V1 tch, on becoming acquainted with this, com menced active hostilities, and sent General Nas- viduf with a powerful and vengeful force against Kars. When this force arrived in that district, ^uhammed Pasha, Governor of Kars, came out Wl th his troops to give them battle; but having toacherously entered into a treaty with the Rus- S1 ans, he fled precipitately, and shut himself up in Kars.

Muhammed Pasha, on hearing this alarming intelligence, and reflecting on his own base conduct, turned round, and cheerfully engaged to drive away the Russians. he accordingly came out of the fort, and having, in concert and with the aid of Aly Pasha, drawn out their forces in battle array, they defeated the Rus sians so severely, that they obliged them to fly in dismay from the environs of the castle, and to seek shelter in the distant villages of that district.

They therefore deposed him; and, in his place, raised to the sovereignty the excellent Sultan Mustafa, son of Abdul Hamid Khan, who had long inhabited the cell of obscurity. They seized and put to death Hajy Ibrahim, the Khiah Pasha, who they supposed to be the founder of the New System, besides many other public officers; and several of the Ministers were dismissed and changed. This intelligence had as yet been scarcely heard, when Godovitch, after having been twice defeated by the Othman army, having repaired his losses and again raised the standard of hostility, appeared with his blood-shedding infantry in the * Here is another play on words, difficult to translate.

The consequence of the defeat sus tained by the Russians at Ak Kelah, in Alcalzike, was, that Yusuf Pasha suffered pride and presump tion to seize his mind ; and even in his Letter to the Viceroy of the splendid sovereignty, he permitted himself to spread * open the gates of boasting and vaunting. The Prince Viceroy, on perceiving this pride and arrogance in the Pasha, and the haste and precipitancy (the causes of all disorders) with which he acted, represented to him, by way of ad vice—' That in opposing the Russians, he should ' avail himself of time, and use patience and cau- ' tion ; and meanwhile exert himself in making all ' necessary preparations for war, and the organiza- ' tion of his army;—that particularly he should ' employ every mode of conciliating the leaders and ' valiant chieftains of the neighbouring tribes; and ' remain quiet until the world-embellishing stan- ' dard of the Prince, borne by resolution and cor- ' rect judgment, should shed splendor on those ' regions;—and that Yusuf Pasha should then be ready for action, prepared for events, and watch ' a favourable opportunity for giving battle; so that, ' by the junction of the countless hosts of Iran and ' Room, the complete expulsion of the Russians ' might be effectedf.'

But Yusuf Pasha, not suffering the shell of his ear to nourish the pearls of these gem-scattering counsels, hastened to attack the Russians J. For this purpose he detached Syed Aly Pasha and Mu- hammed Pasha (he himself remaining half a farsang in the rear) to give battle to Godovitch, who had fixed his encampment in the station of Ba'indar Luy, in Shurah Gil. When four hours of the night had elapsed, Godovitch attempted a night- attack on the Othman troops, and in the darkness of night put his men in order of battle : but the world-disturbing cannon of the Othman troops soon opened their formidable dragon-like jaws, and chal lenged the Infidels to combat, with voices of thun der and warlike cries. The death-dealing musket each moment flashed lightning in the gloom of night, and consumed with destructive fire the palms of the leopard-like champion's existence. Yusuf Pasha, during the confusion caused by the contest, the French in Egypt: but, rely on it, the greater part of this Letter never existed, but in the brain of the author; for the Prince Royal was at this time, and long afterwards, remarkably diffident of him self, and had a great respect for the abilities and character of the ci-devant Grand Vizir. + Truth will out;—and it is, that Yusuf Pasha, tired of and seeing no end to the delays and excuses of the Persian Government, re solved to attack the Russians, without their assistance.

Nearly 500 of the army of Room were taken prisoners, and as many more took the road leading to the valley of death and oblivion. Yusuf Pasha fled precipitately towards Kars. As to Muhammed Pasha, the governor of that place, who had had the chief hand in exciting these wars, but who also kept the flint and steel of wickedness concealed in the sleeve of depravity, although orders for his appearance at Constanti nople had been frequently issued, yet he had al ways found excuses to disobey his master and sove reign's commands. Now, however, ^usuf Pasha practised an excellent device towards him; for having calmed his apprehensions, by conferring on him many favours, he so managed, that a fresh order for his personal appearance should arrive from the Emperor's sublime court; on which ^ usut Pasha then prevailed on him to set out in the direction of Istambul, but appointed some persons, in the course of his journey, to relieve his head, filled with mischief, from the incumbrance ol his body.DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. S2o CHAP, LXX1X. AN ACCOUNT OF THE ENGAGEMENT OF PRINCE MUHAMMED WALY MIRZA, BY THE IMPERIAL COMMAND, WITH THE UZBEG AND AFGHAN TROOPS ; AND THEIR DEFEAT BY THE TROOPS OF ERIVAN. Praise and gratitude are due to the Almighty, the Ruler, free from partiality, from whose munificence and bounty, devoid of parsimony, arises the happy horoscope of the magnanimous King of kings, by which there are Princes of great hope, though of tender years, (each of whom is a lucid new-moon in the heaven of royalty and splendor, and a flou rishing tree in the plantations of Fortune and mag nificence,) distributed through the various parts of his majesty's spacious realms, daily to despatch some foe, or with the axe of conquest and divine favour to separate and destroy the deepest roots and fibres of the tree of rebellion. The flame pro ceeding from the musket of one lion-hunter kindles a devouring fire among the families of Russ. The point of the foe-destroying spear of another raises the cries of woe from the souls of the Uzbeg and Afghan. The Turkoman-like incursion of the blood-shedding forces of a third desolates the dis trict of Bagdad ; whilst, from the judicious military arrangements of another, the structure of hostility, when put forth by the malignant, is thrown into disorder and confusion. Certainly one of the most distinguished victories gained during this period was that of Prince Muhammed Waly Mirza, Gover nor of Khorasan. In the beginning of Rabi-ul-326 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. akhir, pursuant to the royal command, powerful as Destiny, irresistible as Fate, and guided by the daily- increasing prosperity of the triumphant, realm- bestowing King of kings, this prince turned his energies to the reduction of Herat, and the exter mination of the Afghans of that region. He there fore appointed to proceed against Herat, Muhammed Khan Kajar, Naib and Governor of Nishapoor, with the Khans of Hazarah, chiefs and forces then present at the Durbar, accompanied besides with a nume rous host; which, pressing on like the stream of the Euphrates, advanced in the direction of the River Ghoryan, and were led on by the triumphant prince. In that quarter there were assembled nearly 50,000 Afghans, consisting of the celebrated men of Kandahar, Ferah, Andakhud, Badghis, Mai', Chak, Asferaz, Kandaz, Khatlan, Jijaktu, Mimaneh, Faryab, Ta'imanoy, Jamshidy, and Takudary, each individual of whom considered himself to be equal in bravery to the blood-quaffing Mars of the skies. They brought with them Sufy Islam, the depository of the temporal and spiritual hopes of their ill-fated race, and therefore the inspirer of courage and confidence to the Afghan troops; the shadow of whose standard, and the banner of whose pro tection, they regarded as a sacred asylum. With perfect confidence and firmness they advanced to Fort Shakiban, within six parasangs of Herat; whilst the Heaven-aided host, without hesitation, moved to meet them from Fort Shadah. One para- sang from Shakiban both parties put themselves inDYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 327 battle array. Thursday, the 22d of Rabi-ul-akhir (the last of the spring months), terminated the vital spring of the enemies of Fortune and True Religion; for so fierce a battle and so dreadful an encounter then took place between these armies, that Mars, victorious in fight, seated himself in a retired part of the fifth sphere to behold the engagement*. On the side of the prince, the battle soon changed from projecting bullets propelled by flame, to the use of the sword and poniard; and the ever-victorious troops made use of no other fire than that which the waved dagger-blade struck from the bodies of their wicked foes ; nor of other instrument, than the flame-raining sword which flashed in the faces of their dark-fortuned enemy. Fortune turned away from Prince Firoz; and he perceived the thorn of adversity had pierced the foot of exertion, and that the path of safety was covered with the chaff of calamity. From necessity, he deserted the field of battle; the standard of the infidel, Sufy Islam, was depressed; and the vain-glorious boasting of the Afghans was turned against them. On this occa sion, Sufy Islam, with two of his wicked disciples, 130 of the most celebrated and distinguished Afghan nobles of the first rank, such as Badal Khan Fuful Za'yi, Kada Khan, and Mahmud Khan Fa'imany (brother to Palang Push Khan Jamshidy), with 6000 more of their army, became the prey of the foe-subduing sword. Between 6000 and 7000 * The Persians seem to be of Homer's opinion, that a battle is not complete without Divinities are spectators of it. 7W328 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. more, of whom nearly 200 were nobles and chief tains of this demoniacal race, such as Abdul Ghi'as Khan, Fuful Zayi, brother to Madad Khan, Ishak Zayi, besides another brother to Palang Push Khan Jamshidy, and Barkhurdar Khan, Ishak Zayi, were made prisoners. The prince and his army obtained immense spoil and plunder, consisting of gold, silver, tents, furniture, horses, mules, and mountain-like camels : the value of the wealth which thus fell into the hands of the victorious and orthodox champions was so great, that the imagination of the most able arithmetician would be puzzled to note or compre hend its amount. A jihun * of blood flowed from the field of battle to the gates of Herat, and the brave champions of the Faith galloped over mountains of the slain. Such part of the Afghan force as escaped the sword were dispersed, and the whole extent of their calamity and perdition soon became apparent. Muhammed Khan Kajar pursued the fugitives to the gates of Herat; and there, throwing up entrenchments, raised the standard of triumph to the heavens. The discomfited Firoz arrived at Herat on the midnight of the day of battle, ac companied by two or three persons, in deep mourn ing and affliction: blocked up and confined in the fort, their heart's-blood streamed from their eyes. * The word in the original is ion, the plural of the Arabic word ain, ' a fountain.'DYNASTY OF THE KAJAHS. 329 CHAP.

F rom those criminal measures towards the servants of the highly-dignified monarch which Aly Pasha, from his limited capacity and want of experience, had in the preceding year permitted himself to adopt, the inhabitants of Bagdad (the abode of peace), on his return to that place defeated and fugitive, became disaffected to him. About the middle of Jummady-ul-awwal, at the instigation of one of his courtiers who was much in his confi dence, two of his Gurchy {i .e. Georgian) slaves were induced one morning to assassinate him. On this event being made public, the nobles and principal men of Bagdad, together with the Janissaries, sow ing the seed of zeal and obedience in the soil of their breasts, hastened to tender their submission to Suleiman Pasha Kahia, and raised him to the supreme power, in Aly Pasha's place. The mur derers, seeing this, mounted the steeds of flight; but some cavalry, which Suleiman Pasha despatched in pursuit of them, overtook them, and with the edge of their well-tempered swords sent their souls to mansions of perdition. The Pasha also committed to writing an account of this event; which he des patched, with suitable presents, to the world-pro tecting Durbar of the triumphant sovereign. When, however, the intelligence of the murder of Aly330 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. reached the Othman court, Sultan Mustafa, the emperor, conferred on Yusuf Pasha the government of Bagdad, Irak Araby, and all the dependent ter ritories. This appointment, however, Suleiman Pasha counteracted, by rendering the officers of government so well satisfied with him*, that, by their mediation, he was again elevated to the command of Irak Araby. The Othman Ministers then sum moned Yusuf Pasha to Istambul (the seat of tem poral power'| v ); and he, having put Othman Pasha in his place in Erzeroum and Kara Hissar, proceeded to the Othman Court. Thus those countries were deprived of the benefit of the abilities and the rec titude and probity of this great man, who, from his upright and honest government, from his generous treatment of the people placed under his care, and from his affable condescension towards all, whether friends or strangers, was considered a miracle.

With Mirza Muhammed, Napo leon despatched General Gardanne (who was emi nent amongst the most confidential and favoured Ministers of his court, and was besides a commander of 12,000 men); and as Ambassador, he was ac companied by a suite of twenty-four persons, all distinguished for talents and sagacity, and bearing from Napoleon an amity-breathing Letter, and a friendship-exciting Treaty. General Gardanne was directed to wait on the Prince Viceroy, as well as on the triumphant sovereign. The following was the substance of the Letters he brought: That ' Napoleon the Great, either by force or by nego- ' ciation, would expel the Russians from Gurjistan ' (7. e. Georgia), and the other countries belonging ' to Persia usurped by them;—that without theDYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 333 ' accomplishment of these objects, he would enter ' into no treaty of any kind with the Russian Go vernment. This done, the Government of Erivan should engage to renounce all ties of friendship with the English, and should co-operate with Na poleon in the invasion of Hindustan.' Mirza Muhammed Reza, and General Gardanne the Ilchy, having therefore solicited a public interview with the Prince Viceroy at Tabreez, the seat of royalty, the General presented Napoleon's Letter, and re ceived the attentions and favours due to his rank. The Prince Viceroy then appointed as his Meh- mandar, Faty Aly Khan Nury, the Kur Yesawal Bashy, a grandee of the court, and a person of dignity and experience ; and the ambassador pro ceeded to the world-subduing sovereign's court. On his arrival at Teheran (the seat of Government), the triumphant sovereign lavished on the French Hchy all kinds of attentions and distinctions, ex alted him by an interview in the Hall of Audience, and conferred on him the title of Khan; at the same time honouring and noticing his fellow-tra vellers with boundless munificence. Askar Khan Afshar Arumy, a distinguished chief, was also ordered, with complete equipments and appoint ments, to proceed as Ambassador to France, taking with him many precious commodities and beautiful Ejects as memorials of friendship; and charged a ^o w ith Letters, both from his exalted Majesty and the Prince Viceroy, expressive of their friend ship and good-will towards Napoleon.334 dynasty of the kajars.

However, it was the Prince-Vice roy's secret intention to fall unexpectedly on the Russians, before they could open the campaign; and take advantage of the first favourable opportunity which might present itself. At this time, however, a courier arrived from Field-Marshal Godovitch, and proceeded to the royal Durbar: the substance of what he had to request from the climate-conquer- in g sovereign was peace and concord. At the same time, the Field-Marshal made a declaration to General Gardanne Khan, to this purport: ' That (( considering the peace now subsisting between the ' Governments of France and Russia, and also the f strong desire felt by Russia to be in friendly relations with the Government of Erivan, he would leave the completion of this object to the zeal and energy of General Gardanne Khan*.'

It seldomDYNASTY OF THE KA.IARS. submitted these advices to the clirnate-concjuciincj sovereign, and expatiated on them : but the king observed, in reply : ' Godovitch's purpose, in ma- ' nifesting a desire of this nature, is meiely the ' result of imposture and artifice, which will only ' terminate in determined hostility and enmity. The General, having endeavoured to submit to the unequalled monarch some arguments and proofs to the contrary, and recommending the affair to be taken into negociation, was permitted to depart from the royal presence. The General communicated what had passed to Godovitch ; who sent Baron Wrede, commander of the Russian ordnance, with a complimentary Letter to the Prince Viceroy and to General Gardanne Khan; whilst he himself, under pretence ot repair ing the losses of last year in Akhsakeh and Yela- mishy, moved from Teflis to the confines of Pambak. On this, the Prince Viceroy despatched the essence of virtue, the \ izir Mirza Bazurg, to the imperial court, and submitted the state of affairs to the de voted Ministers of the sanctuary of splendor.

General Gardanne Khan, who was at this time in attendance on the royal stirrup, in the Plain of Sultaniyah, on becoming acquainted with this step, with earnest solicitation submitted to the imperial presence this representation: ' That, to prepare ' tlie means of carrying on war against the Russians, ' who are friends to the two Governments of Iran ' and France, is an unseemly measure: besides, I am certain that in a few days a courier will arrive ' with all expedition from Paris, the seat of my ' Government, and bring the account of the Rus- ' sians adopting measures for evacuating the terri- ' tories of Iran: therefore, when a matter can ' be terminated by mildness, it seems contrary to ' the dictates of prudence to have recourse to hos- ' tihties: and therefore it seems most advisable ' that the vengeance-breathing hosts should return 'to their abodes, and employ the autumn and ' winter months in preparation for marching, fully ' equipped, to Hindustan, on the opening of next ' spring:' To this the unequal sovereign replied : 'If Godovitch's design, by insidious negociation, 'by halting in Pambak, be to march on Erivan, (&lt; and attempt to surprise the fort, matters will go ' hard with the garrison, for want of the necessary ' military preparations.' On this. General Gardanne Khan gave a written guarantee, to the following purport: ' If hostilities against the champions of the Faith should be first commenced by the Russians, then let General Gardanne be treated ' as a criminal offender at the court of the sove-838 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. ' reign, magnificent as Jamshid*.' On the other hand, he requested, on the honoured side of his majesty, a written agreement, to this tenor: ' That if hostilities against the Russians were first com- ' menced on the Prince Viceroy's part, then the ' Vizir, resembling Aristotle, should be held re- sponsible for that attempt, and should receive ' from his majesty, sublime as the heavens, censure ' and merited disgrace.' These engagements being drawn up in his victorious majesty's presence, they mutually sealed and delivered them to each other, and thus ratified the agreement, that an armis tice should immediately take place on both sides.' Nevertheless, the triumphant sovereign failed not to conduct himself by the rules of prudence and * The French had very unthinkingly assured the Persians, that Alexander did not dare to resist any wish expressed by Napoleon through his ambassador in Persia; and therefore they had seen, to their astonishment, Godovitch refuse to accept or listen to the pro positions made by Gardanne. The most unfortunate step the French ambassador took, was the premature advice he took on himself to give the king, ' to employ the autumn and winter ' months in preparation for marching, fully equipped, to Hin- ' dustan, on the opening of next spring.'—' From that moment, as Mirza Bazurg afterwards told me, ' I saw all the mischief the '■* French alliance, if followed up, would lead us into : and I P re ' ' vailed on the king and Mirza to obtain a paper from General ' Gardanne, the contents of which I knew he was unable to per* ' form, and which would therefore afford us a just pretext to ' break off the alliance, whenever we chose to do so.' He also told me, Mirza Shafia was a little alarmed, and hesitated about giving the second paper; but, said the Mirza, ' I gave him ' courage, by telling him to recollect the Russians had by no ' means shewn themselves willing to regulate their operations hy ' the advice of General Gardanne, and pointing out to him the ' immense consequence it was of to us, to be able to give the ' Frenchmen check-mate whenever we pleased.'DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 339 the maxims of sound policy; and therefor© repeat edly urged the pure-minded Vizir to transmit sup plies of money and other necessaries to the ever- victorious troops at Erivan : yet this virtuous per sonage, through perfect reliance on the General's engagements, judged it not requisite to convey stores, or direct the countless hosts to march to wards Azarba'ijan. General Gardanne now obtained permission to join the Prince Viceroy's retinue at Khoie. On his arrival there, an envoy, despatched in great haste from Godovitch, reached General Gardanne; and from the tenor of his Letter the following meaning was collected:—' Although, ac- ' cording to the alliance which now exists between the French and Russian States, it is of course to 'be expected that amity must shortly be esta blished between Iran and Russia, yet, however, an ' order from the Emperor has just reached me, commanding me to march on Erivan: still, how- 'ever, my most earnest desire is, that, through your mediation, the accomplishment of peace may be reflected on the mirror of hope fOn ^ceipt of this. General Gardanne Khan sent Mons. Lazare (i. e. Lajarre), his deputy, to Godovitch, along ^th the envoy on his return, and also wrote him Som e explanations; but as Mons. Lazare was seized a severe illness during the journey, his arrival Ul th Godovitch did not take place for a long time. ^ There is every reason to believe the last member of this ^ntence was not fairly put forth to the Persians.310 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS.

Godovitch marched on Erivan with a large force of cavalry, rapid as lightning, and several divisions of infantry, spreading the flames of destruction. He at the same time detached General Nibalsin with a large force to Nakhshiwan, by way of Karabagh* Thus he manifestly persisted in the infraction ol treaties, through a crude fancy, that perchance the object of his wishes would not refuse his embrace; that the tree of long-entertained hope might at last bear fruit; and that by exertion and perseverance he might open himself an entrance into the well- protected kingdom of Iran. The Prince Viceroy, who in the magnanimity of his heart possessed re solution solid as the foundation of heaven, and who in his dealings elevated the standard of humanity and liberality to the empyrean sphere, had until this moment confined himself within the line pre scribed by covenant and treaty, and, never enter taining the idea of battle or thoughts of war, had * This alludes to the engagements between General Gardanne and Mirza Shafia, which, though ratified by the king of PersM, were never taken any notice of by the Russians.

The cavalry and infantry, assembled at the shadow of the ever-victorious stirrup, were ranged in two divisions. The Tabreez foot-guards, a body of Sarbaz from Maraghah, the musketeers of the body-guard, and the artillery with their cannon, splendid as the galaxy, were appointed to advance and reinforce the musketeers of Asterabad, Damawend, and Ker- man, and the royal guards of Khorasan ||, who were engaged in defending the fort under the command of Hasan Khan Kajar, brother to Husain Khan Sardar.

A division of the Tabreez and Khoie Sarbaz, with a considerable force of musketeers from Maksud Lu, Chena Shaky, Khan Duzy, and many of the royal body-guards, were ordered to Nakhshiwan, and committed to the command of Faty Aly Khan, the Kur Yesawal Bashy; and in the mean time, the retinue, rivalling the stars in splendor, conferred lustre on Kho'ie, by awaiting there the arrival of the victorious troops, from the stirrup of the sovereign, magnificent as Jamshid. On terminating these arrangements, Farraj Allah Khan, the Nasakchy Bashee, who had formerly been ordered by the royal command to Sulimanieh in the territory of Bagdad, to confirm the power of Abd-ur-rahmin Pasha as governor of Baban, having accomplished the object of his mis sion, was now ordered by his majesty to join the Prince Viceroy, and arrived at Khoie with his army completely equipped. From another quarter, Aman Allah Khan Afshar, governor of Khamsah, came up with 2000 cavalry, and obtained the honour of a joy- diffusing interview with the prince, at Khoie. When these were assembled, the Prince Viceroy, with his army completely equipped, advanced from Khoie, firmly resolved to give battle to the Russians. On their first halt, it was represented to his highness s Ministers, that Husain Khan Sardar, with perfect reliance on a numerous body of the Kurdish horse of Erivan, and the other forces under his command, *DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 343 had occupied the road in Godovitch's line of march; and on his arrival in the territory of Erivan, the collision of the contending forces took place : but while Husain Khan Sardar was engaged in close combat with the Russians, the Erivany Kurds, on hearing the report of the Russian cannon, lost all courage; and although not one man of their body had received the smallest hurt, they fled from their post like the wildest beasts of the desert, and, traversing the valley of flight, reached their tribes ; which, in the greatest alarm, striking their house hold tents, and packing up such of their effects as were at hand, crossed the Aras. The Sardar, after great exertions, considering the smallness of his force and the multitude of his opponents, saw no advantage in continuing the engagement, and re turned to his entrenchments. On hearing this, the Prince Viceroy immediately ordered Farraj Allah Khan, by way of Korash, and Aman Allah Khan, by way of Nakhshiwan, to his assistance; and he also appointed Ahmed Khan Mukaddam to guard the confines of Nakhshiwan. At this time, as the confines of Karabagh, Ardebil, and Mashkin were stripped of the Heaven-aided troops, it seemed to him necessary to order forces to these districts : he therefore detached Ameer Khan Kajar to Mughan and the summer cantonments of Karachehdagh, with troops consisting of infantry and cavalry, supplied with cannon, zambooraks, and abundance of stores. The victorious retinue, with a number of the at tendants attached to the royal stirrup, and the troops from Ferahan and Guzaz, which had not perfectly learned the New System, halted at Korash.DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. After the lapse of a few days, it was reported to the prince, whose mind is luminous as the sun, that before Farraj Allah Khan and Aman Allah Khan arrived at Erivan, Godovitch, being eager to besiege the fort, had despatched General Samandarovitch Partunkin, whose head was filled with mischief and agitation, to take possession of Sharvar or Sharur. The Sardar, urged on by his innate energy and natural elevation of soul, could not patiently endure this; and therefore, raising the standard of battle, advanced to meet Samandarovitch. It was his in tention, when the battle began to grow a little warm, to retire by degrees, in order to infuse con fidence into the enemy ; and when the cavalry were separated from the infantry, to take them on the rear, then wheel round and open his ambush to repel the infantry, and by the same manoeuvre dis solve the solid masses of their infantry; but it so happened, at the moment of the Sardar's returning to the charge, that a thick cloud of dust arose in the plain, so that both armies were mixed together. From the density of the dust, victor and vanquished, friends and foes, were confounded in one mass. The Sardar's reserve, on beholding this circum stance, imagining that he was defeated, began to fly; while the Sardar, being anxious to extricate himself from the dust, retired a little distance out of it, in order to take an accurate view of the pos ture of affairs, and, by the resources of his great skill, renew the battle. By chance, his troops came up to search for him ; and finding the field of battle devoid of their leader's presence, they imagined that he had fled: and as they knew not in whatDYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 34 direction he went, their hearts were filled with terror and alarm, so that the whole division di spersed in different directions, and persons of under standing smiled with derision at their causeless panic. The army was dispersed in such a manner, that the greater part reached the baggage; while the Sardar, with a body of the guards which remained ^th him, maintained the contest with exceeding- bravery, killing and wounding several of the enemy. That same day Farraj Allah Khan and Aman Allah Khan joined the Sardar with the brave men of their divisions, and the dispersed army was once more collected: the Prince Viceroy also, to punish this cowardice and want of spirit, ordered several of the fugitives to be put to death, or otherwise punished. After this, Husain Khan Sardar, with Farraj Allah Khan and Aman Allah Khan, having reorganised the troops, hastened to give battle to the Russians; ^ho, on beholding the preparation and complete equipment of the army, declined to meet them; and, withdrawing the foot of enterprise, reposed in their entrenchments; while the above-mentioned chiefs kept their ground both day and night, in wstile array, expecting an engagement. CHAP. LXXXV. A&gt;i ACCOUNT OF THE BATTLE FOUGHT BY THE PRINCE VICEROY WITH THE RUSSIANS AT NAKHSHIWAN. At this period it was made known to the Prince iceroy's clear and comprehensive mind, that Ahmed Khan Mukaddam, in fighting against the Russians wno were marching to Nakhshiwan, had displayed346 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. some irresolution, and that in consequence the Russians had arrived in the vicinity of that place. The high-minded prince, not enduring to let such a measure pass without resistance, although he had no force of any account in immediate attendance on him, expressed his determination to give the Rus sians battle. At this time, intelligence was con veyed to the royal counsellors, that Nuzur Aly Khan, and Farraj Allah Khan, the governor and Na'ib of Ardebil, having entertained unfavourable sentiments concerning Najuf Kuly Khan Garus, who had been appointed to put the fort of that place in order, had fled from thence with their tribe, and, having arrested Husain Kuly Khan of B^dkobah, who had been the cause of putting to death the Russian General Ashpukhdar, had proceeded to Lankaran, the residence of Mustafa Khan Taulish. This latter also, on account of his relationship and alliance with the fugitives, became quite alarmed ior his own safety; and they all joined in endeavouring to introduce the Russians into that country. The Prince Viceroy, paying no attention to these alarm ing reports, putting his whole reliance on the Creatoi of the Universe, and listening only to his own pro* found prudence, moved from the station of Churas, and, on coming to the banks of the Aras, halted at half a parasang from Nakhshiwan. An order ^ 3 s also issued to Husain Khan Sardar, and Farraj Allah Khan, for the cavalry to come to the royal stirrup, accompanied by Aman Allah Khan. As these chiefs were perfectly secure about the Fort of Erivan, and also about the loyalty of the tribes and inhabitants of the country, who felt no inclination to submit toDYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 34-7 the Russians,—some of them having removed across the Aras, and others having gone in the direction of Kars, were thus quite protected against Russian aggression,—these brave champions, therefore, by mutual agreement, taking their whole force with them, left in Erivan, Sadik Khan, Uz-uddin-Lu Kajar, with a division of the Urumia Afshars, and proceeded with the greatest expedition to join the Prince-Viceroy's stirrup. During these events the Russian troops having come to the village of Kara- babay in Nakhshiwan, the Prince Viceroy applied all his noble faculties to ascertain the quality and quantity of their force. Although the site of their encampment was in an elevated position*, and was nowhere commanded, and so situated that the at tack of cavalry and infantry was totally useless or impossible, the Sardars imagined that by surround- ln g the eminence on which the camp stood they could blockade the Russians; and as they saw no advantages in giving battle, the Prince Viceroy en ured into their views, and proceeded towards the enemy. On arriving near them, he observed, through ^telescope, a great force approaching by way of Kotel Saryan, to reinforce the Russians at Karaba- ,)a y. Considering, therefore, the elevated site of ^e encampment and the arrival of such great re- mforcements, the advancing to give battle did not * One of the most striking things I saw in Persia, was the pictures ^presenting the Prince-Viceroy's battles with the Russians. In ese, all rules of perspective were set at defiance; and in one of 1 le 'n which I saw (I believe at Isfahan), mirabile dictu I there was ^presented a Russian soldier cleft in two by the sabre of a Persian lnr5 cman, and each half of his body standing separate from the r us if nothing had happened.348 dynasty of the kajars. appear to include any considerable advantage: yet, as the magazines oi the Heaven-aided aimy were distant, and the encampment of the victorious host was situated among deep valleys, the possibility of sustaining some loss by halting there, as well as the probability of a nocturnal attack by the Russians, made such a measure a violation of all prudence and sound policy; and, on the other hand, to return without giving battle appeared derogatory to the dignity of honourable feeling, and unworthy of the high majesty and splendor of the monarchy. Notwithstanding, therefore, the persevering en treaties of the royal Ministers to the Prince \ iceroy to avoid an engagement, he nevertheless gave orders to attack the Russians. On the right of his line he placed Husain Khan Sardar and Aman Al^ 1 Khan Afshar, with the division of Muhammed Khan Zangineh and Muhammed Beg Kajar, Afshar, gene ral of the musketeers : on the left of his line were Farraj Allah Khan Afshar and Aly Khan Kajar, with the division of Katimy Khan Beg and Naby Khan Guzazy, commander of the flame-exciting Sarbaz. The Tabreez divisions, urged on by courage and energy ot character, ascended 11 lofty mountain, hurled down many of the Russians from the crest of the hill, and by theii valour nearly gained the summit from the Russians, when unexpectedly the Russian reinforcements connir up from the rear, the area of the field of hatt became enveloped in almost total darkness hoi the clouds of dust raised by that force. At this time it was nearly sunset; when Muhammed IK- in the midst of the attack, being wounded in th 1DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 349 head by a musket-ball, fell down senseless on the spot; and the soldiers of his division, seeing their commander fall, were quite dispirited by his loss. The golden-winged Simurgh of day now longed to retire to her western abode ; and the Prince Viceroy, having collected his cavalry and infantry, withdrew from the field of battle under the shadow of his victorious standard, and com- menced his retreat from the seat of contest in per fect order. As it was the prince's secret plan to obtain a decided victory and evident superiority at the termination of the contest, he, at the moment of retreat, along with his ever-victorious guards, the divisions of Chehar Duly and Khajewand, having drawn the sword of triumph, charged the Russians scattered about in the vicinity of the lofty moun tain, and many heads of Russian chiefs ornamented their spears. As the cannoneers of the train had only made their first essay, they were not of course as perfect as the Russians; therefore the prince, placing himself at the head of the artillery, main tained the firing, and excited the gunners to keep U P an incessant fire; and when the heads of the Russians rolled like balls over the plain, he then raised the standard of return *. * The whole account of this battle, if battle it may be called, is s0 absurd, contradictory, and bombastic, that I can make nothing 1 : but the prince's ' secret plan,' I suspect, if examined closely, Wo uldtum out to be, that the Persians, in their retreat, fell in with ome straggling Russians, put them to death, and carried off their ea(ls on spears, as a proof of ' decided victory ' and evident supe- r Wity.350 dynasty of the kajars. CHAP. LXXXVI. AN ACCOUNT OF THE PRINCE VICEROY CROSSING THE ARAS ; AND OF THE ARRIVAL OF MONSIEUR LAZARE, ON THE PART OF GENERAL GARDANNE KHAN, FOR THE PURPOSE OF MAKING PEACE. O n the arrival of the Russians in Nakhshiwan, the tribes and cultivators in the neighbourhood of that place, either voluntarily or by compulsion, removed from their abodes and residence, and fixed their habitation in a place called Durreh-i-Sham, close to the River Aras. As the Prince Viceroy imagined that some danger might result to the Fort of Erivan from the Russian army, he crossed the Aras; and having commanded the ever-victorious train to halt at the station of Kuban Basan, ordered Aly Khan, and Ibrahim Khan, Yuz Bashy of the Ghoolams, with a considerable force, to chastise the Russians of Nakhshiwan. Aly Khan obeyed the order without loss of time; and coming unawares on the Russians, slew several of those who came out of their en trenchments, and afterwards fastened their heads to the saddle-straps of their brave men*. The Rus sians, being greatly alarmed by this attack, remove from that part, and fortified themselves amongst the ruins of the city of Nakhshiwan. In this situation, posted as it were in a fortress, Aly Khan judged it not prudent, having only cavalry and infantry, to * In the Travels of the Two Muhammedan Travellers to India ^ China in the Ninth Century, translated from the Arabic hy 4 e . j Renaudot, I find the following reported as a custom on the s ^ ^ of Elnian.

At this conjuncture, the magnanimous and exalted mind of the king being directed to the support of Ameer Khan, Sardar of Ardebil and Mughan, a decree, powerful as that of destiny, was issued to this pur port : ' That the above-mentioned Sardar should ^ exert himself to keep in their duty the different magishates of laulish and Ardebil, which was a ^ most desirable object: but if this was impossible, ' an(i they continued to wander in the valley of error, then, whatever was impressed on the ' tablets of their fate, or whatever the pen of Om- ' nipotence had inscribed on their foreheads, should ^ become openly displayed on the bridal throne of publicity f.' Whilst these events were taking place. Monsieur Lazare, though labouring under extreme debility and languor, arrived at the camp, and, having obtained the honour of an audience, strenuously solicited permission to deliver the Letter and message of General Gardanne Khan; and al though the prince's counsellors endeavoured to Prevent this, he paid no attention to their opposition, Jnt thus represented' It is customary among (( t le sovereigns of Europe, whenever an envoy sets (( out to restore peace between two enemies, that (( War an( ^ hostilities should be suspended on both (( Sl(les unt il the moment of his return.

In consequence of this urgent solicitation, the Prince \ iceroy letumed from the station of Ivuban 15asan to Ohm as, and Mons. Lazare, having joined Godovitch, laid before him General Gardanne's representations and mes sage, and listened to his replies. As the Russian General imagined that the garrison of the Fort of Erivan, as well as the inhabitants of the city, must see that it was probable that, the fort would be taken by assault, in which case no mercy would be shewn, therefore he imagined that, by making ex traordinary exertions, they would either surrender the fort, or pursue the path of flight. Under this persuasion he wrote an insidious Letter to Husain Khan, and addressed to the garrison all kinds ot deceitful blandishments. The replies to these were made, by the valiant chieftains, from the flaming mouths of cannon, muskets, and shells. Samanda- rovitch at this time having advanced unexpectedly with a considerable force towards Baku, drove away a great quantity of cattle and sheep from the people of the country, and returned to Erivan. The Prince Viceroy then ordered Husain Khan Sardar, Farraj Allah Khan, Aman Allah Khan, and Sadik Khan, accompanied by the victorious army, to give battle to the Russians, and relieve the fort: but on the arrha of the troops in that territory, there fell so heavy a snow, that the cavalry were unable to move, foi t ie horses could not keep their feet; and therefoie, 1 it was impossible to surmount these difficulties, t h , were obliged to return to the victorious train.DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS ^53 CHAP.

The return of these Generals raised the spirits of Godovitch, especially when he beheld the thickets cleared of the formidable lions of war, and the ap pearance of every thing agreeable to his wishes: nevertheless, if he had reflected, he must have per ceived that hereafter the immense force which was collected must cause the utter dispersion of his army. But he regarded present circumstances as affording an opportunity of great advantage; and therefore, notwithstanding the extreme cold and the severity of winter, he excited the conflagration of battle, and advanced with all his forces of every description against Lrivan. After discharging the terror-spreading cannon-balls against the walls of the fort, which were in no part secured by a fosse, about two or three yards of the castle wall were breached, so that he judged the soldiers could easily force their way into the place. On the night of the ^th of Suwal, near the true dawn, 1 he night of calamity and destruction closed in ' bloomy, and black, as the fortune and faces of the king's foes. ' The world was covered with a veil, dismal as the soul of the widow; u ■ stan T hosts of heaven were concealed from mortal sight; And neither Mars nor Saturn nor Mercury greeted the eve of the traveller.' such a night, the Russians hastened from everv f iuaiter to take the Fort of Erivan by storm.

On witnessing the present state of affairs, so intensely eagei were they for battle and for hazardous exploits and head scattering, that one could only liken it to the \ita spark returning to an inanimate corpse, 01 the optic nerve restored to a darkened eye-ball. I 11 one instant, on every side along the bastions an curtains of the castle, they grasped the high) tempered dagger, the blood-shedding sword, an the fire-showering musket: they drew out their lines, and, well prepared for the fight, anxious foi encounter, with lips closed against muttering 0 clamour, and a fixed purpose to catch the prey,t e } crouched like lions in ambuscade ; until the ^ 10 * I do not hold myself responsible for the sense of this p or play on words; but I have not thought it right to distuiDYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 335 Russian force, having passed over the fossef, brought to the foot of the castle all their machines and en gines for storming, and their scaling-ladders, lofty as the galaxy. When they had fixed the ladders on every side against the walls, and mounted aloft like smoke, no sooner had they planted the first footstep on the parapet, than the orthodox cham pions from every quarter displayed torches and lights and stretched out the arm of might to repel the invaders, and, placing entire reliance on the aid of the only true Sovereign, began to assault them with fire and flames. Although at this moment Husain Khan Kajar was labouring under a heavy malady, and was scarcely able to move, yet, placing his trust once more on the victorious monarch's auspicious fortune, he did not hold himself exempted from the battle. In like manner, Ashraf Khan Damawendy threw himself for support on the as sistance of the Almighty, and fixed his trust on the exalted imperial good fortune; and during this mighty uproar, to which the tumult of the Day of Judgment alone exhibits a parallel, was carried un hurt through it.

In short, more than 3000 of their men were slain; 450 of whom were generals, colonels, majors, and officers : the others were brave and distinguished youths, despatched to the vale of oblivion by the hands of the True Believers ; and nearly 3000 more were severely wounded. When those who escaped the slaughter saw that their state became desperate, they withdrew, dispirited and mourning, to their en campment, entering into the stone and clay recesses of their fortified towers and entrenchments. The abundant mercy of the Almighty and his infinite goodness were on this occasion so manifestly con spicuous, that, notwithstanding the activity and energy displayed by the champions of the Faith, two or three individuals only drank the cup of martyr dom, and not more than five or six were wounded hy the hand of the vile foe ; so that, on the whole, the wounded and slain did not amount to more than ten.

With a wounded heart, ' In tears he passed the day till the night-fall; ' And the night-fall brought no relief to his sor ows.' Before the news of this great event reached the camp of the Prince Viceroy of the exalted monarchy, several intrepid warriors, eager for battle, com manded by Ismail Khan Kajar, arrived there from the royal Hall of Audience; bringing with them, from the exalted sovereign's treasury, abundant supplies of coined gold, arms, stores, and other necessaries: and, as there now remained no obstacle to carrying on the war against the Russians, the prince, moving with all the cavalry and infantry from Choras to Nakhshiwan, sent out, like unchained lions from the happy encampment in that place, several detach ments of champions to scour the country. Husam Khan Sardar and Ismail Khan Kajar, with a body of the Heaven-aided troops, were ordered to Erivan; while Aly Khan Kajar and Aman Allah Khan Afshar proceeded to Nakhshiwan, in advance of the train, majestic as the starry hosts. The astounding re port of the advance of these two armies shook the foundations of the Russian courage : they therefoie determined, on the night of the 22d of Suwal, to quit their entrenchments, and take to flight. Husain Khan Sardar and Ismail Khan Kajar pushed on, against their rear; and having come up with it, de prived many majors and soldiers of life, and took several prisoners: many also hastened to the princes camp, and obtained quarter. Several waggons with immense stores, belonging to the Russian force, be came the spoil of the orthodox and victorious cham pions. As the cold of the atmosphere was now intense,dynasty of the kajars. 859 before Godovitch reached Gurjistan the hands and feet of several of the Russians were quite dis abled, from the effects of it in the extreme severity of the forty days of winter*: many also of the wounded men, on the declivities of the hills and mountains, being overwhelmed in snow, resigned hope and life, in despair. The commanders of the Heaven-aided army, having obtained complete suc cess, returned to the Prince-Viceroy's service. In another quarter, as soon as Aly Khan Kajar, Aman Allah Khan Afshar, and Faty Aly Khan Nury, the Kur Yesaval Bashy, who formed the ad vance of the army, had merely crossed the Aras, General Nibalsin, feeling himself unable to maintain his position, fled with his detachment: but the Per sian detachment, having come up with him four parasangs from Nakhshiwan, slew several of his men, and made many prisoners: their arms and stores also fell into the hands of the victors; but night coming on, the Russians halted, and took post v among their waggons : so, in like manner, the de tachment halted near them, waiting with anxiety for the appearance of morning; but the Russians, discovering what was intended, turned, during the night, their faces to the valley of flight, and, after a thousand difficulties, arrived at Karababa, the site oi the former engagement between the two armies. But here, also, the Prince-Viceroy's retinue, like some celestial plague, came up with them. General ^ibalsin, on witnessing this, became quite con- * ' Forty days of winter.'

The guns were taken on in front; and soldiers posted on the summits of the moun tains, to guard the roads until the artillery was con veyed to a place of security. Although the ascent and crest of Sasyan were occupied by the fugitives, as well as the rugged passes and the summits of the other hills and mountains, so that a charge of in fantry and cavalry was extremely difficult, as was clearly visible to all beholders, nevertheless the Prince Viceroy commanded Husain Khan Kunker Lu to advance with a detachment, by a narrow mountain path, and attack the Russians: he also appointed a body of resolute men from Birahah to act on their right, thinking they might probably reach it before the Russians, and intercept their passage. Notwithstanding, from the steepness and ruggedness of the mountain, a rapid advance of the enemy-chasing infantry and cavalry was almost im practicable, yet the detachment skirmished with the enemy till night came on, and the Heaven-aided train followed them at a short distance. In the night, the Russians, who had only halted a short time on the mountain, taking advantage of the darkness, fled with extreme precipitation; and the * This alludes to what is said of the Sabaeans in the Koran, which shall be given at length in the Notes.DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 361 tiiumphant retinue halted at the station of Kara- baba. Next day the prince detached Ahmed Khan Mukaddam on his right; whilst the fortunate train moved by way of Salwaraty, in order that, by in- teicepting the passage of the Russians in the direc tion ot Birahah, he might deprive them of every resource, and so totally destroy them. At this con- juncture, the snow, wind, and storm, became so exceedingly violent, that it was impossible for the men to see each other; notwithstanding which, the cavalry and infantry were, by immense exertions, brought up in sufficient time to fall on the Russians. The order for the attack being given, a division of brave men and cavalry penetrated among the Rus sians, slew many of them, and made some prisoners : others also fled, and came to the Prince-Viceroy's victorious stirrup. Notwithstanding the ground Wa s b y no means adapted for a charge of cavalry, nevertheless a body of horse, at full gallop, fell on the Russians; and both sides were engaged in con test and combat until night, when the Russians ^treated to a lofty mountain. The Prince Viceroy having now committed the completion of their de struction to the dreadful snows and intense cold, determined to return ; and the victorious troops, Ringing with them many heads, prisoners, and m uch plunder, joined the exalted retinue : on which victorious banner returned to Karababa. Next the prince arrived outside the town of Nakh- s Wan ; and staying there two or three days, to put tle affairs of that place in good order, he after- War ds proceeded to Tabreez, the seat of govern- toent. During the march thither, it was repre-362 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. sented to the prince, ' that the remainder of the ' Russians, in their route to Karabagh and Teflis, ' were so greatly afflicted by the intensity of the cold, ' that the pen of description cannot enumerate the ' details of their sufferings; and that even those who escaped with life lost their hands and feet.' The Prince Viceroy, having submitted the particu lars of this signal victory to the devoted Ministers of the Sanctuary of Splendor, his exalted imperial majesty, in return for this loyal devotion to his person, conferred all manner of gifts and favours on the nobles and soldiers; and, to shew his gratitude for this distinguished success, graciously bestowed, in all parts of his realms, considerable sums in gold and silver on the pious Doctors of Religion : among others, the eminent professors of Azarba'ijan ob tained a considerable portion of these royal gifts. At this time, Aly Khan Kajar, in consequence of a wound he received in his foot when charging the Russians, directed his steps to the gardens of Para dise; the occurrence of which mleancholy event profoundly afflicted the Prince-Viceroy's benevo lent mind, as the deceased was a man of heroic bravery. The prince, who always testifieddue re gard for those who served him zealously and faith fully, despatched his corpse with all becoming pomp and ceremony to the Most Holy Najf, where his remains were deposited in the vicinity of the victo rious Lion of God * (on whom be peace and bene dictions !) * Assad Allah, ' Lion of Godone of the titles of Aly-dynasty of the kajars. 368 CHAP.

AND OF AKA IBRAHIM, CHIEF PRIEST OF KHOIE, RETURNING FROM HIS EMBASSY TO THE OTHMAN COLRT. On the return of the Prince-Viceroy's Heaven-aided train from ]\akhshiwan, there arrived representa tions from Ameer Khan Kajar and Mustafa Khan Taulish, to this purport: ' That Mustafa Khan ' having succeeded in removing the alarm and suspicions of the Shahun fugitives, entreats 'that the dust of their crimes may be washed ' off by the pure streams of the Prince-Viceroy's ' beneficence.'

At this time, the chief of learned Doctors, Aka Ibrahim, chief priest of Khoie, who in the beginning of the year had been despatched from the Imperial Durbar (the centre of prosperity), as envoy to the Othman Government, returned from his mission ; and at Tabreez, having the honour ot an audience of the Prince Viceroy, communicated to him the great delight felt by the Othman Go vernment on receiving the soul-nourishing intelli gence, of which he was the bearer. After this, the exalted Viceroy conferred splendor on Tabreez, by his return to that place, and by devoting himself to the arrangement of whatever promoted the interests of the soldiers and cultivators. CHAR LXXXIX. AN ACCOUNT OF THE HEPAIRINQ OF FORT ANNAJAK IN NAKHSHlWAN. T he Fort of Annajak had been for ages a principal fortress of the Governors of Iran, and a stronghold of the great and glorious Princes in Azarba'ijan: but at this period, its tanks and wells, like the eyes of the malignant, were dry; and its winding diffi cult road, which formed the approach to it, was broken and ruinous, as the hearts of foes. In the — 7 spring of this year, therefore, the royal zeal of thedynasty of the kajars. 3(55 Prince \ iceroy led him to repair parts of this fort, and to rebuild others: and, by the same zeal, its choked tanks were cleared and made water-tight, and filled to the brim with pure water. The prince also appointed a body of guards, eminent for bravery and vigilance, to garrison and defend that lofty and strong fortress; causing it to be amply furnished ^vith all sorts of stores and supplies. CHAP. XC* an account of the arrival of sir harford jones, baronet, as ilchy or envoy from the english government ; and the establishment of a treaty between the two exalted empires of iran and england. When the account of the amity subsisting between the French Government and that of Iran came to hearing of the English Ministers, they were alarmed at a measure productive of so much injury 'o the interests of their State; and the Governor- general of Hindustan a second time appointed Brigadier-General John Malcolm Behadur, Envoy to Iran. The General, influenced by this determi nation, sent a person to the royal Durbar, and thus represented to the Ministers of the State:—'Friend- Th's chapter will be treated of very much at lar^e in the Notes, .ill:? | m t an ' me .' 1 implore lhc Read&lt; ' r to believe I would very so y'/ 0aU the thin g s my old friends have been had,!. ? 1° say of me ' exc ' eI '' ' thatI h ' d seen '•&gt;&lt;! world, and *&gt; mul and eVil 11 con ' ai ' s i' because these words are I alJ . common and fulsome routine of eulogy, that 'iderp? 5 ^ ' 3 ? proof the kin S '''I the Ministers con- had I i U 01 ' 0 coutldence, from the experience they diffiT, , my e0nduCt i . n the var ' ous transactions between us, in liurin aces ' ail( ' &lt;&gt;n ^^ erent important and delicate occasions, 'ig 1 the space of near thirty years.366 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS.

If the Mi- ' nisters of Iran avert their sight from amity with ' France, the friendly purposes of both parties will ' not only be carried into effect, but be daily aug- ' mented by the good intelligence subsisting be- ' tween the two States. Otherwise, amity with the ' Government of France must ultimately lead to ' hostility and war with England.' Although the exalted Ministers had suspected, from Askar Khan's protracted stay in Paris, that the engagements en tered into with the French Government were not to be depended on ; yet, as maxims of State and the rules of sound policy did not permit them to publish their secret transactions to all the world before the exact state of affairs became evident, to permit communications like those of General Malcolms, while the transaction was kept concealed, would be, in truth, repugnant to the principles of good faith and sincerity, and entirely opposed to the magnani mity of the State and monarchy : consequently, the Government of Iran was not inclined to sanction the completion of this embassy; while, at the same time, the French ambassador possessed the greatest influence at the seat of Government, and was ex ceedingly delighted at the occurrence of this event. At this period, through the clear-sighted poli c } adopted by Lord Howick*, the English \ izir, (whose * It is remarkable, the appellatives Ho wick and Jones, written without the vowels, are, in Persian, significative—the first, of ^ ru Justice, Equity, Law, Reason, Rectitude, Steadiness, Vigilan ce ' the last, ' The head of a genus or kind.'

Sir Harford was eminent for prudence, perfectly versed in all the subtleties oi diplomacy, unrivalled in re flection and foresight, and intelligent in conducting affaiis. He had seen the world, explored its various regions, and had tasted the good and evil it contains. Before this period, he had twice, during the Zend Dynasty, travelled into Farsistan, and was conse quently well acquainted with the manners of the People of Iran. On his arrival at Bushire, as his communications and statements were dictated by sincerity and pleasing manners, they proved accept- le to the Ministers of State: besides, as all his actions and conduct were adorned with the science of blandness of manner, sincerity, and clear-sighted ness, his discourses produced a deep impression on his majesty's mind, so that the hearts of Ministers jvere strongly inclined to cement friendship between e two magnificent States. In conformity to the royal order, Mihrab Khan Afshar, Deputy Nasakchy j hy of the Sublime Hall, and who ranked among tne most eminent nobles at the court dignified as Saturn, was appointed his Mehmandar; and thus Jwrng the negociation of the Preliminary Treaty: and the old tiistt i, jMhzci Shufia, was so pleased with it, that he despatched a I ^ 1( ^oinmunicating' to his majesty what he considered )e a most felicitous omen.308 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. the Ilchy was conducted to the capital with great honour and distinction. The day on which he was honoured with the royal audience, he presented, in a graceful style and heart-captivating manner, the Letter of State, which was truly the title-page to the volume of friendship. In this royal epistle he had placed a costly brilliant of such beauty, as to become the object of envy to Sirius and Canopus; and which, at the time of opening the Letter, became noticed by the imperial sight, endued with solar energies. After this, the envoy having received all kinds of friendly attentions from the Vizirs and Nobles of the court, was permitted to retire. He next had an interview with the Prince Viceroy at Tabreez, the seat of royalty : from that most noble prince he witnessed friendly acts, attentions, and kindness beyond all limits, and became a guest at the royal banquet; and also received the most flat tering marks of respect from all who formed the prince's court. Baronet, in the English idiom, means a dignity in nobility like that ot Nikabat among the nobles of Iran; and every one distin guished by the king of England with this honour transmits the title to his family. In short, on the mere arrival of Sir Harford Jones, Baronet, in Isfa han, his original purpose was attained. Genera Gardanne Khan retired from the seat of Govern ment, and proceeded to Azarba'ijan. The manners, habits, speech, and actions of Sir Harford Jones, Baronet, grew every moment more agreeable to the imperial mind : in all his interviews with the Ministers of State, by his graceful speech and admirable conduct he bore away the ball ot370 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. blotted out. It happened during this time, that General Malcolm, who in liberality and intrepidity exceeded all his cotemporaries, had been a second time appointed Envoy to Iran, by the Go\einor- general of Hindustan; and he, on his airival at Bender, communicated his office and appointment to Ministers. Although the perfect rectitude and experience of Sir Harford J ones. Baronet, had been demonstrated in various ways, so that Mirza Abul Hasan, nephew to Hajy Ibrahim Khan, the former Vizir, had been appointed to proceed to the English Government, yet, in consequence of the union and concord subsisting between both empires, it seemed necessary to shew distinction to General Malcolm, and an order for his appearance at court was issued. At the period when the delightful meadows of Sul- taniyah, by the presence of the imperial retinue, ex cited the jealousy of Paradise, General Malcolm Behadur attained the distinction of kissing his majesty's carpet, and became the object ol loyal mu nificence. At this conjuncture, despatches trans mitted from the English Government to Sir Harfoi Jones, Baronet, came to Tabreez, and caused his ' Diu quidem inhumanitati regiae assuetus, non tarnen ' quiu hoc metaphorice dictum esse crederem.

As, during this time, the above-mentioned General, by diligent investigation, had become intimately acquainted with the pursuits and acts, the consum mate prudence, and conduct of Sir Harford Jones, Baronet, he justly reckoned his own presence un necessary : having therefore halted only a few days in Tabreez, he proceeded from thence to Hindustan, with suitable Mehmandars and becoming honours, by way of Kurdistan and Kermanshahun: and every succeeding day, the admirable qualities and sincere attachment of Sir Harford Jones, Baronet, became more conspicuous in the area of demonstration. As most of the important treaties and transactions with the Othman Government and those of Europe had been entrusted, by the royal command, to the Prince Viceroy, he did not allow himself a single moment's repose, either in these points or in his campaigns against the Russians, who at this period were hostile to Iran and England, and in alliance with the French. The above-mentioned envoy, therefore, with profound prudence and reflecting foresight, judged it proper to remain near the illus trious and puissant heir to the crown. As soon as he had settled the stipulations, and completed the treaty, with some other details, he, by the royal command, stopped at 1 abreez, and was engaged in attendance on the Prince Viceroy; where, by his B 1) 2372 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. praiseworthy services and elevation ot sentiment, he attained unbounded confidence and distinguished favour, to such a degree, that he became an object of envy to the ancient servants of the ciown . how much more to all others! CHAP. XCI. THE OCCURRENCES OF THE YEAR OF THE HEJIRA 1224 (A.D. 1809). GENERAL GARDANNE KHAN RETURNS, FROM IRAN TO FRANCE, WITHOUT NAPOLEON'S PERMISSION. Once more the lamp of the bright sun diffused splendor and joy in the chambers of Aries; and the gales, impregnated with the perfume of the vernal rose, shed the fragrance of Paradise over the senses of the inhabitants of the world : the vernal breezes spread abroad the leaves of the hyacinth and rose, like the hand of Iskander scattering the treasures of Dara. The climate-conquering sovereign, on ter minating the festival of the Nurooz, turned his attention to affairs of State: and at this time there arrived a memorial from Monsieur Champagny, the French Minister, stating, ' That respecting the ' treaty between the empires of France and Iran, ' and the dismissal of Askar Khan, the delay which ' had occurred was connected with various consi- ' derations.' Monsieur Jouannin, who was then m attendance on the royal stirrup, imparted the vanous intelligence he received from France by way o Bagdad and Aleppo; the tenor of which was, that, after every new victory. Napoleon's expressed ■* : tention of expelling the Russians from Iran was on the point of being executed; as nothing no«DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 373 remained unfinished except the Spanish affairs. It appeal ed also, that Askar Khan, who had been long detained in Paris, had been once sent for, and desired to communicate to Napoleon the names of those countries belonging to Persia of which the Russians had taken possession, to enable the French Em- peior to inti oduce this matter into his conversation, at his interview with the Emperor of Russia: but from the tenor of what has been made public, it was most evident that, at the time this interview took place between these sovereigns, this subject was not mentioned. However, whatever custom required as due to a guest, either in hospitality or politeness, was observed most carefully by Napoleon towards Askar Khan, and the honour he received surpassed all former precedents. General Gardanne, as before mentioned, on returning from attendance on the sovereign exalted as Saturn, attached himself to the Prince-Viceroy's stirrup, living in great honour and esteem, and distinguished every day by the prince by some new attention or proofs of boundless munificence. As the prince wished to learn the European tactics. General Gardanne sent to his r oyal presence one of his suite, named Monsieur Verdy*, a man profoundly versed in that science. In truth, Mons. Verdy displayed so much zeal in this matter, that the prince, reflecting on his ex- ceJlent intentions and the purity of his motives, de livered into his able hands the reins of full power ov er the soldiers appointed to practise the New System; in such a manner, that not one of all those * Monsieur Verdier.37 t DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. individuals had the power to move without his per mission ; and hence they all became ' As the paintings on a wall, ' Which neither speak nor move at all:' so these men, until some sign or intimation pro ceeded from Monsieur Verdy, might be supposed to be almost inanimate bodies. Monsieur Lamy*, the mathematician, who had been sent by General Gar- danne Khan to Teflis, now returned to Tabreez, and his departure from thence was deferred; for by the Prince-Viceroy's commands he was engaged in teaching geometry and mathematics to some young men endowed with intelligence, sagacity, and ta lents ; in which employment he truly displayed the greatest zeal. When Field-Marshal Godovitch ad vanced against Iran, and hostilities had commenced between the two armies, the Prince Viceroy made all requisite preparations for the campaign; and it was signified to Monsieur Lamy and Monsieur Verdy, that they, with their pupils and disciples, were to accompany the ever-victorious train, and were called on to make the arrangements necessary for active warfare. On which they represented ' Notice has come to us from General Gardanne « Khan from Teheran, to this purport: ' A general ' peace has been concluded between France an ' Russia: it is therefore incumbent on you not to t( engage in such undertakings as might be con ' strued to give assistance to the troops ot Iran ) t( though you may remain in the quality of guests m 44 Azarba'ijan.' We therefore must hold ourselves * L'ami.DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 375 ' excused and exempted from compliance with your ' highness's commands, in this instance.' At this time. Monsieur Lamy, who had gone to visit Erivan, reached that place ; and, on his return, represented to the Prince Viceroy: ' I also went to visit the ' Russian army in the vicinity of Erivan; and I have ' seen with my own eyes, that, in the course of ' eight or sixteen days, that army must obtain pos- u session of the lortress.' As the prince had per fect confidence in his sincerity and truth, he by no means imputed this discourse to malignant feelings; nor was he in the least alarmed, but, placing his re liance and hopes on the Creator of the Universe, fixed his heart on the divine aid. In short. General Gardanne Khan at the royal threshold, and Mon sieur Verdy and Monsieur Lamy in attendance upon the Prince Viceroy, were greatly honoured and es teemed ; until news arrived, that Sir Harford Jones, Baronet, who had been appointed Ambassador to Iran by the exalted English Government, was come to Isfahan, and would shortly arrive in Teheran. General Gardanne Khan was greatly astonished, and vehemently declared : ' It is necessary imme- ' diately to appoint a person to oblige the English ambassador to quit the kingdom ; or if this is not ' done, permission should be given him to return ' to France.' Notwithstanding that, during many days, his sublime majesty, with his own exalted lips, and the Ministers of the illustrious State, endeavoured b y various means to prevent him from executing this design of returning to France, the ambassador paid no heed to these counsels; but, leaving Mon sieur Jouannin at the royal threshold, to communi-376 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. cate to him day by day exact intelligence, he set off for Tabreez with the greatest expedition, previously entering into this agreement with the Ministers of the State :—' I shall remain at Tabreez; and from ' thence transmit an account of Sir Harford's ar- ' rival and treatment to Napoleon, and there wait his answer on the subject.' Notwithstanding this, his exalted imperial majesty acted towards the Gene ral with due attention and munificence, so that there occurred not the least diminution in the respect and honours paid to him. General Gardanne, however, on arriving at Tabreez, deviated from his pledge to the royal threshold; and, giving up the intention of remaining with the Prince Viceroy, determined to quit the place, and proceed to France. The prince, both by his own personal representation and through the medium of his Ministers collectedly, and Mu- hammed Khan Mukaddam Beglerbegy in particular, strongly urged him to remain, according to his agreement with the imperial court; or at least to delay until his report reached the French capital, and the answer was received*. The General, how ever, would not consent to remain, but departed immediately. On this occasion, the Prince Viceroy exhibited all due honour and attention to him, and appointed Faty Aly Khan Nury, the Kur ^esawal Bashy, his Mehmandar. At this time, news arrived of hostilities having commenced between France * The reader will please to observe, my friend Mirza Bazurgs name, who was at that period the dry-nurse to the prince, ap pointed by the king, is not mentioned as being one of these Mini sters. By this time, I had got into action and intimate correspon dence with him; and no doubt was left in my mind of the success of the mission, come what would.DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 377 and the Othman State; and the General, being ap prehensive that, like Monsieur Joubert, before men tioned, he might in the course of his journey be treated with disrespect by the Turkish Pashas, de termined to proceed by way of Tefiis. It so hap pened, that Field-Marshal Godovitch had been sum moned to the Russian court; and that, in conse quence, proper attention was not shewn to General Gardanne by General TormasofF, who was appointed his successor. Having left Monsieur Lazare at Teflis, he himself proceeded to Paris. Monsieur Lazare remained there some time, and wrote several successive reports to Monsieur Jouannin: ' That ' a Russian army, of such description, and such ' numbers, has come to Teflis: it is therefore be- ' fitting, out of good faith to the exalted Govern- ' ment of Iran, to communicate the present posture ' of affairs.' The General afterwards set out to Pe tersburg; from whence he despatched news: 'That ' Monsieur Lazare is appointed Envoy to Iran; ' and that, in order to finally settle all affairs be- ' tween Iran and Russia, and secure the complete ' execution of the treaty. Napoleon himself would shortly come to Iran.' On the departure of General Gardanne Khan, Monsieur Jouannin con tinued at Teheran : but as Sir Harford Jones, Ba ronet, looked on this arrangement as improper, he therefore, pursuant to the royal orders, removed to Azarba'ijan; and when the royal standard was afterwards pitched at Oujan, Monsieur Jouannin was there honoured with an audience, and com manded to depart from thence to Paris, that he might communicate in person to Napoleon the378 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. present position of affairs and the requisite mea sures. As Monsieur Jouannin was eminent for sound sense, and also acquainted with the exact state of things from their very commencement, and must have been convinced that the most trifling circumstance opposed to the rules of concord never knowingly occurred on the part of the victorious State, while on the side of France there had not been the least attention to treaties or compacts, he was therefore able to explain, in detail, all events, as he had either seen or heard them. However, on his arrival at Istambul, he received a despatch from France, ordering him to return again to Iran. Ge neral Gardanne Khan, on arriving at Paris, was visited with great displeasure, for his error in re turning without either Napoleon's permission or the formal sanction of his exalted majesty and the Prince Viceroy: he was even for some time de graded to the ranks. Napoleon also summoned Askar Khan to appear before him; and fulfilling the conditions of apology, thus said : ' Although some ' delay has occurred in the completion of our pro- ' mise and the ratification of the treaty, it has ' solely resulted from our being taken up with the ' Spanish affairs and some other occupations. In ' a short time I shall permit you to depart, and ' settle every thing agreeably to your wishes.' It was truly a strange circumstance, that during Askar Khan's journey and embassy, although, on every occasion, successive despatches and detailed ac counts from Monsieur Champagny, the Prime Mi nister, and from others, came to General Gardanne Khan and the Frenchmen of his suite, and also aDYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 379 Letter to the Prince Viceroy and to the Prime Mi nister, Mirza Shafia, yet no ^Memorial or Letter from Askar Khan was ever seen, except on two occasions —one on his arrival at Paris, and the other on his departure, containing an account of his arrival and setting out; and these were brought by some of his own servants. On reaching the royal Durbar, he brought with him Letters from Napoleon, the sub stance of which was as follows : ' Askar Khan has ' faithfully performed the duties of his mission, and a we have given him leave to depart: my friendship ' is exceedingly inclined to go to the utmost extent, ' for the complete accomplishment of the designs ' entertained by your Government.' A person named Monsieur Outrey * had accompanied him, and brought an answer in the same spirit; but turned back previous to entering Iran. CHAP. XCIT.

His majesty, who confined his attention to the present state of affairs between Russia and Persia, gave positive orders to this effect: ' That until the Pisciform banner of the king throws ' the rays of conjunction on the regions of Azar- ' ba'ijan, or indeed without the victorious sove- ' reign's express permission, the prince do not ad- ' vance to give battle, or undertake any expedition; ' but direct all his zeal to preparing, in a suitable ' manner, the equipments of the cavalry, infantry, ' artillery, camel-guns, and the other means of ' offensive warfare (to the amassing of which two ' or three years of his precious life have been de- ' voted, and during which time the sentinels of ' repose, ease, and tranquillity, have been banished ' from the pavilion of his breast), to the end that ' the entire assemblage being submitted to the ' sovereign's all-penetrating inspection, nothing ' may be wanting to their perfect arrangement.' When it became ascertained that the delightful Plains of Oujan were to become the abode of the climate-conquering monarch's victorious banners, before the arrival of the auspicious retinue, the Prince Viceroy, accompanied by the whole ot his triumphant force, with due preparations and stores, exceeding all limits, the Sardars, Beglerbegs, gover nors, learned men, and nobles of Azarba'ijan, tookDYNASTY OP THE KAJARS. 381 up then residence in the Plains of Oujan, eight para- sangs from Tabreez; so that the moment the for tunate train arrived in those regions, they could peifoim the duties of a procession of honour, where soever they obtained permission, or the confiden tial Ministers of his Saturn-resembling majesty should judge it proper. Although the Prince Vice roy desired permission to form the procession of honour at Kapilan Kuh, which forms the limit be tween Azarba'ijan and Irak, permission was only granted to proceed one parasang distant from his encampment: he therefore halted there, and kept the eye of expectation fixed on his majesty's ap proach. His highness Prince Muhammed Aly Mirza had also arrived at Oujan, in advance of the royal train, with a considerable force of the un daunted soldiery, both infantry, cavalry, and artil lery, furnished with all the stores and supplies re quired for military operations. During two or three days, the princes enjoyed an interview with each other in perfect joy and prosperity, and, from the happiness of personal communication, effaced all trace of complaint from the area of their friendship- nourishing hearts. On the 22d of Jamady-us- Sany, the day on which the royal train arrived, they drew out on the right and left the troops, splendid as the starry hosts : from the mixing and blending together of the Sea of Kolzum and Oman, that is, (of the troops of his world-conquering majesty with the Prince-Viceroy's infantry and cavalry, this verse of the Koran, The junction of the two seas &amp;c.,' was evidently exemplified to the sight of all, and to the understanding of the sagacious. The glittering382 dynasty of the kajars. of arms was diffused in every direction ; the hoofs of horses tore up the hard flints; the lightning- footed steeds began to neigh; and the dragon-like cannon poured out, in profusion, volumes of flame and peals of thunder : the clouds of dust raised by the armies turned the bright day into night: the expanse of the atmosphere, from the loud-resounding zambooraks, became agitated: the flashes from the star-eclipsing muskets filled the vault oi heaven with smoke. When the sun of majesty arose above the horizon of the road, the Prince Viceroy dis mounted, and, scarcely distinguishing his head from his feet, advanced to the imperial stirrup*: the fire of affection then burst into flames, and tears of joy involuntarily flowed from his eyes; an event which excited the sympathy of all present, so that the eyes of great and small, who witnessed this scene, were suffused with tears. His majesty, the shadow of God, having accurately surveyed the lines of infantry and cavalry, the soldiers and body-guards, the engines and military stores, bestowed exceeding commenda tion on all. On his arrival in the camp splendid as the heavens, the chiefs, Sardars, the distinguished men among the soldiery and cultivators, the eminent men, nobles, judges, and persons of merit and learning, seeking in crowds eagerly to pay their re spects to his Paradise-like majesty, obtained the honour of notice and distinction, by admission to the presence beaming with splendor. * That is, he bowed so low.dvnastv of the kajars. 383 CHAP.

AN ACCOUNT OF HIS EXCELLENCY MUHAMMED ALY MIRZA BEING DETACHED TOWARDS GL'RJISTAN ; AND THE PRINCE VICEROY ORDERED TO GUKAJAH AND GANJAH, AND OF FAR RAJ ALY KHAN THE NASAKCHY BASHY, BEING SENT TO KARABAGH. W hen information was brought to the Ministers of the Paradise-resembling court, that TormasofF, who succeeded Count Ivan Godovitch in the command of the Russian troops, had halted at Suganlak, one parasang from Teflis, and had detached General Nibalsin with a great force towards Karabagh ; and that a body of his own troops had besides been ordered to guard the districts of Hamamlu, Beg- kandy, and Kamrah, in the territory of Pembak and Shureh Gil; and that he had also sent the Waly Bulkunik with another detachment to protect Gan- jah and the tribes of Kozak, Shamku, and Shams- ud-deen Lu; the king's world-illuminating prudence determined, that in every direction the victorious troops should march to meet them, and give them battle. At this moment, representations arrived from the Governors of Akhsakah and Bazachuk, giving the strongest assurances, ' That themselves, u as well as the people of Gurjistan, who have for ' so many years witnessed all descriptions of bounty ' and encouragement from the Prince Viceroy, and ' who have learned from far and near his munifi- ' cence to his servants, are now animated, by sincere ' devotedness and unlimited reliance on his support, &lt;f to sentiments of zealous attachment and faithful ' service towards his highness; that they therefore only wait for the moment of the armies of hisSHI DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. ' majesty, glorious as Jamshid, making an incur- ' sion into this country, to prove their innate sin- ' cerity, by performing acts of manifest loyalty.' In consequence of these propositions, his supreme majesty appointed Prince Muhammed Aly Mirza, who had lately come to Azarba'ijan, to this most im portant expedition, at the head of a numerous and well-appointed army: and as, during many years, the Prince Viceroy had been banished from the blessing of kissing the exalted threshold dignified as the heavens, it was therefore settled that he should for some days enjoy the happiness of inter course with the royal presence (to which all honour and reverence are justly due); which enjoyment formed the utmost extent of the prince's ambition, and which goal of desire he was now, through his daily -increasing good fortune, enabled to obtain. After some days, the Prince Viceroy was ordered to ' Gukajah and Ganjah, by way of the steppe of Gu- lambar; and Farraj Aly Khan, Nasakchy Bashy Afshar, was ordered to follow, in the direction of Karabagh; there to watch the movements of General Nibalsin, and to display on this occasion his innate talents, resources, sagacity, and experience in the conducting of military affairs. It was also settled, that the Prince Viceroy, having taken post at Gu kajah and Ganjah, should observe what occurred on the side of Farraj Allah Khan : and it was moreover ordered, that Prince Muhammed Aly Mirza, during his halt at Ganjah, should accurately explore the state of the country, and endeavour to propitiate the different tribes inhabiting it. Farraj Allah Khan, Nasakchy Bashy, had been ordered to proceed toDYNASTY OP THE KAJARS. 3^5 Karabagh, by way of Karachehdagh ; but Nuzur Alv Khan, governor of Ardabil, who the year before during the siege of Erivan, partly from being in volved in a love-affair with the daughter of Mustafa Khan governor of Taulisb, and partly from his want of experience, had introduced confusion among the tribes of that country and joined Mustafa Khan having at this period repented of his conduct, came' to the court, solidly-founded as the heavens; and having there met witli pardon and protection he earnestly entreated that Farraj Allah Khan should advance by way of Ardabil, so that, acknowledging e negligence, disrespect, and opposition which had formerly occurred on his part, in the perform ance of his loyal duty, he might be enabled to atone or ie past; promising, moreover, that he would ^ ''I 3 f? 16 manner ' t0 the Pavilions of and splendor, the other daughter of Mustafa Khan, betrothed to his excellency Prince Aly Khan paternal and maternal brother to the victorious ftmcc \ iceroy; and that he would also bring his ' e completely equipped; and, by acting in con- «rt with Farraj Allah Khan, render some important anrl V ■ WaS tllerefore complied with: 'anaj Allah Khan was ordered to advance by • ° Ardabil, accompanied by Nuzur Aly Khan order that the latter might have an opportunity performing all his promised co -operation. c c386 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. CHAP. XCIV. AN ACCOUNT OF PRINCE MUHAMMED ALY MIRZA. S ENGAGEMENTS WITH THE RUSSIANS : HIS INCURSION AGAINST SOME OF THE BAZCHALU TRIBES ; AND HIS RETURN TO ERI\ AN. A ccording to the arrangements previously stated, his excellency Prince Muhammed Aly Mirza pro ceeded to Erivan, with troops resistless as the ocean-billows, and both the cavalry and the infantry were ready for the shock and collision ot wai . ' The mountain-convulsing accidents of this world rebounded from their hearts: M ' Each appeared the adopted child of death—to slay or be slam. The troops were amply furnished with countless treasures, with all necessary equipments, and with military stores beyond all detail, and accompanie by renowned chieftains and commanders of exalted rank. It was also settled, that his highness Prince Muhammed Aly Mirza should make use of what ever he found occasion for, in the magazines, arse nal, and stores in the fortress at Erivan, whether lead, powder, or the immense stock of provisions, and employ for the same purpose the revenues ot the Government, as well as thePrince-Viceroy's income ; and that the Sardar, Beglerbeg, and all the soldiery and cultivators of Erivan, should diligently execute his highness's commands. Prince Muhammed AJ}- urged on by his natural high-mindedness and in nate energies, did not confine himself within walls of Erivan, but proceeded to Abaran, accompa nied by Husain Khan, Beglerbeg of that distric : he ordered in advance his majesty's confidentsDYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 38? favourite, Ismail Beg Damaghany, with Hasan Khan, brother to Husain Khan Sardar ; also Muhammed Aly Khan Sham Biyaty, with Muhammed Aly Khan, son to Murtazy Kuly Khan, his majesty's uncle, and other chiefs, with host on host, and battalion on battalion, of the vengeance-breathing army, to expel the Russians of Hamamlu and Beg Gandy. The above-mentioned commanders, conformably to the arrangements, advanced with their countless hosts; and fought such spirited engagements, that the Rus sians preferred confining themselves to their fortifi cations, out of which, whenever they did move, they suffered severe losses: many being slain, and several made prisoners, the others turned the standard of flight towards their lines and fortifications. During the siege of the place, more than a hundred were made prisoners; and several heads, on lances, were sent to the foot of the supreme monarch's Heaven- resembling throne. Nakky Beg also, who had long before this removed his tribe from Erivan, and fled to the territories of Pambak and Gurjistan, became repentant on beholding the evil proceedings of the Russians; and during the winter had entered into this agreement with the Prince-Viceroy's Ministers: ' That when the season of spring arrives, and the ' triumphant monarch's blood-shedding hosts ad- ' vance towards Erivan, he would return to his ' former place of abode, with his tribe, dependants, ' and substance.' At this moment, therefore, taking advantage of the favourable opportunity, he removed, with all his tribe, and such dependants as ''e could possibly collect; and proceeded to Erivan, where he participated largely in the various favours388 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. and benefits conferred by the illustrious prince. At this period, Mihrab Khan Afshar was detached to Akhsakah and Bazachuk, with a body of resolute men, and a considerable sum of money; so that, with the great force he before had, falling unawares upon the Russians in Gurjistan, and being seconded by the inhabitants, he might reduce them to the greatest difficulties. As the siege of Hamamlu and Beg Gandy was greatly protracted, and no certain intelligence was received of the rising in Akhsakah or Bazachuk, or of Mihrab Khan's progress, the fire of the prince's indignant feelings broke out into flames: he summoned to his presence those ap pointed to carry on the siege, and determined to display the standard of battle in Gurjistan. When the army, terrible as the Day of Judgment, was put in motion, it happened that the blood-shedding troops encountered a numerous body ol the Baz- chalu tribe, who were hostile to Nakky Beg: theii property and effects, the value of which exceeded all calculation, became the spoil of the army, and their families and children were reduced to capti vity. In consequence of the quantity of the plunder, the army was so much encumbered, that they could not prosecute their march into Gurjistan ; and, lest by some means the Russians should come out ot their holes and corners, and attempt the recovery ol the spoil, they raised the standard of return byway of Kars and Maku, with the intention that, on leav ing their wealth and spoil in security, they woul turn again towards Gurjistan. On their return to Erivan, they were provided with fresh supplies, bot from the fort and the adjacent country ; and, beingDYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 389 prepared for action, determined on coining to an engagement. CHAP. XCV. ACCOUNT OF FARRAJ ALLAH KHAN'S EXPEDITION. Farraj Allah Khan , taking with him Nuzur Aly Khan Shahun, arrived in Ardabil, where he halted some days; and, through the medium of Nuzur Aly Khan, commenced treating concerning the daughter ol Mustafa Khan 1 aulish, who was demanded in marriage for his highness Prince Aly Khan. He waited several days, anxiously expecting Nuzur Aly Khan to bring the Shahun cavalry, according to promise, to his camp; but as the dust of that cavalry arose not in the quarter in which it was looked for, and as the stipulated nuptials were not effected, it ^as evident that Nuzur Aly Khan's proceedings were only based on pretences and delays. At this moment also, Mustafa Khan, having compelled the infantry, cavalry, and principal persons of Taulish to emigrate, conveyed his effects and property to the Fort of Jamish Wan, situated on the Caspian, near Saru Pusht, a Russian port; and halted there tranquilly. He also sent his son, Mir Hasan Khan, with a body of Taulish troops, in time to surprise Hasan Kuly Khan BMkobah, Hashim Khan Shir- wany, Aly Khan Rudbary, and Muhammed Khan Begdily, who were posted in the vicinity of Oojarud: they fell on them unawares, and raised the dust of alarm and destruction of every kind : they took prisoners, Aly Khan Rudbary, Muhammed Khan Begdily, and the brother of Hashim Khan Shirwany;DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. and, after this exploit, directed the standard of re turn towards Taulish. Farraj Allah Khan, who till this occurrence had observed the rules of friendship and kind attention towards Mustafa, although much of his conduct was reprehensible, on witnessing this movement, obtained permission from the royal Dur bar, exalted as Saturn, to act, in the matters com mitted to his charge, in the manner most suitable to the exigency of the times. He immediately adopted decisive measures, arrested and imprisoned Nuzur Aly Khan, and Farraj Allah Khan Shahun; and shortly afterwards sent them to the royal Dur bar. He also directed troops to move from every quarter against Mustafa Khan, and followed them up closely himself; and the result of these measures shall shortly be detailed by our descriptive pen. CHAP. XCVI. AN ACCOUNT OF THE PRINCE VICEROY ADVANCING TO GOGAJEH AND GANJAH; AND OF THE EVENTS WHICH OCCURRED IN THAT REGION. A ccording to what has been before stated, the Prince Viceroy proceeded to Gulambar, where he halted some days; there he appointed Abul Faty Khan Juwanshir, with a division of intrepid youths, to inspire the tribes and cultivators ol Karabagh, adjacent to the station of Kapan and Mukarry (which were under his authority), to render to the eternal empire loyal service. Abul Faty Khan under took the above commission with great ardour, and detached a body of Shahun and Begdily cavalry to the confines of Bftdkobah, to bring him intelligenceDYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 391 concerning the Russians in that country, as well as of the general situation of affairs. By chance, one morning before day-light, they unexpectedly fell in with a body of Russians, and, before they were aware, in the gloom of night found themselves closely engaged: they, however, charged them so vigorously with the sword and lance, that all the Russians were sabred, and despatched to the realms of annihilation : the victors, on bringing their heads, and the cattle of their transport train, to the Durbar, magnificent as Heaven, became objects of royal bounty and boundless munificence. After this, the Prince Viceroy, triumph at his stirrup, and joy holding the reins of his bridle, moved from the steppe of Gulambar, proceeding by way of Oordu- bad; a route exceedingly difficult to pass, on account of the extreme steepness of the roads. In the pas sage, the prince encountered many difficulties; but effected the march in safety, with his artillery, baggage, and stores, and, with the victorious in fantry and cavalry, safely reached Nakhshiwan. At this place, Bulkunik Baron Verdey, and Asisur Michael, brother to TormasofF, with a Letter from the General, had the honour of an interview with the Prince Viceroy. The purport of the Letter was as follows: ' That as the Russian Government de sire to obtain the provinces of Erivan and Nakh- shiwan, their brain is excited*, and their head in toxicated with the wine of the attainment of these heart-expanding objects: therefore their great wish is, that the Rivers Kur and Aras should What immediately follows, to the word ' objects,' seems to be •nore like a Persian reflection than a part of the Russian Letter.DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. ' form the boundaries between the empires of ' Iran and Roos: and, in compensation for this ' claim, the realms of Erzeroum*, Bagdad, and ' other Othman provinces bordering on the Para- ' dise-like regions of Iran, shall, with the full ' consent of Russia, be absolutely transferred to ' the imperishable empire.' Now, in making these idle proposals, they pro bably permitted the taper of hope to shew its light in the chamber of their confused intellect: not re collecting, that prudence suggests, ' Count not on the skin of the uncaptured antelope.' The Letter also contained this further communica tion : ' If an Envoy from the exalted Government ' be appointed to the Russian State, matters will be ' terminated by a definitive treaty : but if the Envoy ' is sent, and peace should not be actually effected ' according to the wish of the latter Government, ' no injury, from the adoption of this measure, ' can result to the exalted State of Iran.' The Prince Viceroy sent the envoys to Tabreez (the seat of Government); and despatched the Letter, without delay, to the imperial residence, in order * The Russians have since obtained possession of Erzeroum. but at this time the offer was something like selling the skin before the bear was killed. It will by no means surprise me if ^ Russians, one day or other, taking a leaf out of Buonaparte's book, commence in reality the game of indemnification with Persia, b) taking the whole of Azarba'ijan and Irak into their hands, and giving the Persians Bagdad and its dependent districts: which, perhaps, the Persians might find some consolation in being f olTe to accept; since they would thereby become possessed of shrine 5 extremely dear to them from religious prejudices, and of countries, if well cultivated, inexhaustible in their produce.DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 393 that cin answer imglit be given to it^ m sucli terms as the king's all-powerful prudence should deter mine. He then put in motion the victory-ennobled standard from Nobbgarroon, which is twelve stages from Ganjah . but as an halt at some of the inter vening stages was unavoidable, and as the supply of provisions in the camp was short, he took with him a supply for a lew days from the city of Nakhshiwan, and proceeded, by way of Sharoor, to the steppe of Gogajeh: thus, by taking this route, he encountered the hardships ol snow and cold, lest in adopting that of Erivan he might derange the plans of Prince Muhammed Aly Mirza. On arriving at the steppe cf Gogajeh, he ordered Pir Kuly Khan Kajar, and Muhammed Khan Karaguzlu, with a strong detach ment, to arrange all matters among the tribes of Ganjah, giving express orders to this purport: ' T hat whichsoever of the different tribes proposes to walk in the path of obedience, let the chiefs ' and heads of families of those tribes come to at- ' tend the Prince-Viceroy's auspicious stirrup : but ' whichsoever of them pursues the path of oppo- ' sition or perverseness, let them know that due ' punishment and castigation shall be inflicted on ' all such.' The train, revolving like the heavens, with the whole of the infantry and cavalry, then passed through the jungles and thickets of that region; which it was difficult even for the western gales or a pismire to penetrate, owing to the close ness and extent of the thickets and forests. The tribes of the country, on the arrival of Pir Kuly Khan with the forces detached on this expedition, learning the glad tidings of the near approach394 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. of the triumphant prince's splendid banner, tra versed, with boundless delight, the stations ot sub mission : the heads of families, with their forces of infantry and cavalry, through excess of joy, scarcely knew whether they stood on their heads or their heels*, and hastened to shew their complete devo- tedness to his highness, the favourite of fortune. Of course they became the objects of his boundless attention and munificence. Waly Bulkunikf, on learning their loyal attachment to the eternal enipiie, gathered his whole force together, determined on flight, and wandered about in the regions of adver sity. The Viceroy of temporal and spiritual power had detached Ameer Khan Dava Lu Kajar, with a strong force, to Ganjah : on their arrival in the vicinity of that place, several Russians ot the neign- bourhood fell in with the victorious champions of the Faith, by the flashes of whose fire-striking fal chions they were hurled to the mansions of destruc tion. The inhabitants of Ganjah, high and low, approached Ameer Khan in perfect confidence, and, proceeding from thence to the resplendent presence, were received with distinction, and partook of the prince's unbounded munificence. Ameer Khan, also, entertained hopes of getting possession ot the Fort of Ganjah, and destroying the Russian gam- son ; as several Armenians of the fort, on receiving an assurance of safety from the exalted Durbar, had agreed to deliver it up to the Heaven-aided army. At this conjuncture, news came to the princes * Literally, ' to distinguish between their heads and their feet. t A Russian commander.DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 395 Ministers, that TormasofF on one side, learning Prince Muhammed Aly Mirza's return towards Erivan, and thinking himself by this movement perfectly secure, had advanced to Zakkam, in the district of Ganjah, with his whole force of every description, animated with the most sanguine and vindictive views: whilst, on the other side. General Nibalsin, having learned the confusion and trouble excited by Farraj Allah Khan in the affairs of Taulish, proceeded with perfect security from Kara- bagh and Barda towards Zakkam, where he joined TormasofF. Waly Bulkunik, also, having joined TormasofFwith his whole force, the whole were now prepared for active hostilities. In short, the entire Russian force, except what was left to garrison the different forts, were now assembled at Zakkam, and were fully resolved to give the Prince Viceroy battle. TormasofF also became acquainted with the designs of the Armenians in Ganjah; and sent a mes senger to the commandant of the garrison, who, in obedience to his orders, imprisoned the chiefs of the Armenians. Notwithstanding the Prince-Viceroy's victorious troops did not amount to a fourth part of the Russian force; notwithstanding provisions also were as scarce in the camp as the phoenix or the philosopher's stone ; notwithstanding the frost and snow, from the elevation of the country, were so exceedingly severe, that the double-tongued pen is utterly unequal to describe their effects; not withstanding the communication with the royal troops in Erivan and Nakhshiwan, on account of the junction formed by the Russians, and of the in- fluence of the demon of the air on some of the tribes■ F. i 'l^ 1 ' - DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. in that country, was attended with great interrup tion ; notwithstanding all these unfavourable circum stances and difficulties, the Prince Viceroy, amidst all the revolutions of this transitory and corrupt world, placing his reliance on the Creator of men and genii, suffered no kind of anxious thought to prey on his mind, profound as the ocean. He gave orders to Ameer Khan, Pir Kuly Khan, and Hajy Muhammed Khan, to appear with their respective forces; and, leaving his stores and baggage in the place of his encampment, appointed Mehedy Kuly Khan Ka-An-Lu to guard them. This done, he gave orders to rush on TormasofF and the forces which accompanied him. On beholding such intrepidity, Tormasoff's head became deprived of reason, and his heart was filled with alarm ; so that now, having resigned all idea of battle and of a regular engage ment, he threw up strong entrenchments, and turned all his attention to such measures for strengthening his position as would enable him to keep his ground. Seeing this, the Viceroy of tem poral and spiritual power detached a body of cavalry, under the command of Aghur Lu Khan, to Ganjah, to be in constant movement about the Russian en trenchments, so as to intercept their communica tions, and cut off from them all supplies of provi sions. Tormasoff saw that a nocturnal attack was his only resource against this blockade: he there fore, at nightfall, when the pitch-coloured curtain was drawn over the face of the heavens, when the stars, like spies, twinkled in their dusky pavilions, and the picquets rested in their posts, selected &lt;M)(X) flame-showering soldiers to make an attackDYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 397 on the Prince-Viceroy's camp, magnificent as the pavilions of Saturn. Between the Russian en trenchments and the prince's camp there was a small wood; and as the Russians came near this, Ibrahim Khan Biyaty, Yuz Bashy of the guards, who was stationed in advance with a division of Ghoo- lams intelligent as Saturn, fierce as Mars, retired to the right and left on the enemy's approach, and took post in the middle of the wood; directing their ears to every sound, and their eyes to the contem plation of the wonderful revolutions of fortune. But from the din raised by the prancing of steeds, the neighing of the Arab chargers, and the murmuring sounds of human voices proceeding from the middle of the wood, the Russians were seized with great alarm, thinking that the Prince Viceroy had deter mined also to attack them by night: under this panic, they flung away their muskets, arms, &amp;c., and hastened back to their entrenchments with great precipitation. Next morning, Tormasoff, making his approach by the door of peace and blandish ment, sent a Letter and gifts to the Durbar (the seat of magnificence), offering many apologies for his measures, and pledging himself to this engage ment : ' That for the future he would, to the ut- ' most of his power, continue to observe the con- ditions of sincere attachment to the triumphant ' State, and would exert himself to prevent the face ' of fidelity from being disfigured by the talons of ' bad faith ; until the Emperor of Roos should order ' him to evacuate the usurped territories, and to &lt;f return to his own country.' He also earnestly entreated ' that no severe measures or perplexing398 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. ' difficulties should be imposed on him, either of ' returning or restoring these regions, before he ' had obtained the emperor's sanction.' He also earnestly implored, ' that from that day all hostili- ' ties should cease ; so that, without loss, opposition, ' or hindrance from the vengeance-breathing army, ' he might return to Gurjistan.' The Prince Vice roy, for many reasons, granted his demands; and the Russian commander pledged himself, in confor mity to the tenor of this treaty and covenant, not to offer any hostility to the tribes and clans of Ganjah, which had re-entered on the path of obedi ence to the Prince Viceroy. After these stipula tions, he set out for Gurjistan ; and such of the tribes of Ganjah as were desirous of sheltering under the king's protection set out for Erivan, even before the royal train quitted the place. At length the prince, victorious and happy, moved, and directed his march to Erivan. CHAP. XCVII. AN ACCOUNT OF PRINCE MUHAMMED ALY MIRZA 's MARCH TO THE STEPPE OF GOGAJEH : AND OF OTHER EVENTS. W hen his highness Prince Muhammed Aly Mirza had returned to Erivan, from the expedition in which the Bazchalu had been despoiled and made captives, he there heard that the Vicegerent of temporal and spiritual power had encamped in face of all the Russian forces, and experienced great difficulty in keeping up his communications. Under these circumstances. Prince Muhammed Aly, feeling the greatest agitation of soul respecting his exaltedDYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 399 brother, despatched Husain Khan Sardar, with a large force, in advance ; and immediately after, the victorious retinue, splendid as the stars, marched forward with the chosen cavalry, and came up at the moment when the Prince Viceroy, favoured by auspicious fortune, had reached the steppe of Go- gajeh. From the conjunction of those two bright stars, the whole region became replete with re splendent lustre, and both sides were mutually delighted with this interview. His highness Mu- hammed Aly Mirza, having obtained his brother's permission to depart in order to terminate some affairs, proceeded to Erivan, followed immediately by the Prince-Viceroy's exalted retinue. On arriv ing there, the Prince Viceroy took away from the victorious troops the Bazchalu prisoners of the Shiah faith, giving those captives unrestrained liberty, and paying for them, to the soldiers, an equitable ransom. By this means he placed on their necks the collar of obedience and attachment. He then summoned into his presence TormasofTs envoys, who during this time had been ordered to Tabreez ; and having conferred on them dresses of honour and distinction, they were ordered to return. His highness Prince Muhammed Aly Mirza, pursuant to the royal orders, proceeded with all his forces to the imperial court; while the Prince Viceroy re mained some time, in order to arrange the concerns of Husain Khan Sardar, and replace the magazines and supplies which had been taken, for the use of the army, out of the stores of the fort. On learning that the royal standard (notwithstanding the intenseDYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. cold of winter was fast approaching, and the snowy season was near at hand) would lemain at Oujan, in order that the Prince-V iccioy s affairs might be definitively settled, the Prince therefore addressed urgent petitions to the royal Dmbai, en treating that his majesty would not expose himself to such great difficulties, and praying that the capital should again become the envy of Paradise, by the king's auspicious presence. It so happened, that, on the arrival of the Prince-V iceroy s petition, the snows began to fall so heavily, that to this day the sight of ages had never beheld a season ot such conspicuous wonder; thus, the heavy fall of snow having commenced, and the temperature ol the at mosphere being changed, the banners, splendid as the heavens, moved back on Teheran (the seat ot empire); and the Prince Viceroy diffused the fra grance of amber over the region ot labieez, by the advance of the retinue, magnificent as the staii) host. CHAP. XCV1I1. AN ACCOUNT OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH LED TO 1 HE SI BMI SION OF MUSTAFA KHAN TAULISH ; AS WELL AS OF OTHER MATTERS, M ustafa K han T aulish , through the consequenceN of the evil suggestions peculiar to ambitious and vain persons, and the temptations of a mind pi one to wickedness, found himself, while in Lankeran, attracting, like a loadstone, the heavy iron aimoui of his foes, and the points of their swords and spears: being desirous, therefore, ot a place oldynasty of the kajars. 401 safety, he set out, with his friends, from Taulish, for the entrenchments of Jamish Van; and turning away his face from his established residence at Lankeran *, he found at that place patience and endurance to be the only anchors useful in the profound ocean of his affliction and woe: so that, on choosing this place as his asylum, he thought himself secure against the persecutions of Fortune. The roofs and walls of the houses in Lankeran, which were only bushes, brambles, and planks of wood, were totally destroyed by fire; and the place, by the hands of the royal troops, was rendered as desolate as the days of separation to the lover's breast, and as afflicting as the moment of adieu when hearts are severed asunder. Jamish Van is a place near Lankeran, in Taulish, situated on the shore of the Caspian, nearly sur rounded on all sides by the sea and a morass : one angle of it only is dry land, by which an intercourse is kept up with Lankeran. On settling there, he solicited aid from friends and strangers; and brought to his assistance a body of Russian soldiers, with some pieces of cannon. However, Omar Sultan, one of the most powerful and distinguished men in Shirwan, and the arbitrator of the rights and dis putes between the two Mustafa Khans, came there, in order to establish the foundations of concord between them, and conduct back the Mughany and Shirwany tribes, which, by the Prince-Viceroy's command, had been removed from Shirwan, and * There is here a play on the words,' Lankeran,' the name of 1 town, and ' Lan^aran,' ' anchors.' D D40-2 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. delivered over to Mustafa Khan Taulish. In con sequence of the disputes and contention which occurred between him and Mir Hasan Khan Taulish (son to Mustafa Khan), the foundation of Omar Sultan's life was destroyed, and violent enmity arose between the two Mustafa Khans. However, at this period, through the exigency oi his state, Mustafa Khan Taulish, shutting his eyes to former feuds and hostility, sent his son, Hidayat Khan, to the house of Mustafa Khan Shirwany, to entreat his assistance. This chief, not suffering himself to be provoked to hostility on account of Omar Sultans death, sent a body of Sali'an musketeers to Jamish Van : and those appointed to conduct the siege, on beholding this measure, pressed the besieged more closely than before ; so that every day a great num ber of his allies, friends, relations, and tribe, took to flight, and, joining Farraj Allah Khan Afshar, pledged themselves to reduce the place : several of the be sieged frequently met destruction, by which the full moon of Mustafa Khan's life was painfully eclipsed, and his alarm greatly increased. He was at last forced to send a person to Farraj Allah Khan, to demand quarter; which circumstance was reported by the Khan to the sublime imperial threshold. On this, pursuant to the royal command, Mirza Bazurg, the Prince-Viceroy's Vizir, who was unequalled in humi lity of soul, and possessed a Jesus-like spirit in con ciliating the minds of young and old, was appointed to proceed to Mustafa Khan, and instructed as fol- lows .—' if Mustafa Khan displays proofs of since- ' rity and rectitude like our other servants, then you,DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 403 like one who restrains the thirsty from the ' cooling draught,' are to restrain the troops, filled with violence and rage, from hostilities against the people of Tanlish, and suffer Mustafa Khan to taste the pure stream of the glad tidings of hope : but otheiwise, you are to give full permission to the resistless torrent, that is, our intrepid host, ' to destroy the very foundations of his being, and, 1)^ the clouds laised by the hoofs of their chargers, ' to make the dust of his existence ascend to the pinnacle of heaven.' On the unrivalled Vizir's reaching Lankeran, the army, like a raging torrent, had determined on the attack on Jamish Van, after this manner : The devoted combatants of Gilan, from the sea-side, in ships and boats, without any other assistance, pledged themselves to storm the place; and the resolute troops of Asterabad, without other reinforcements, promised to gain possession by the land-side ; whilst the faithful men of Taulish, from the side of the morass, like so many water fowl, were determined to carry the place without the help of the other two parties. At this con juncture, Ameer Guneh Beg, son to Mustafa Khan's uncle, a man of boundless humanity, famed for dis crimination and sincerity, and conspicuous for loyal attachment to the imperishable empire, taking the necessary steps before the moment of the crisis, came to the benevolent Vizir on the part of Mustafa Khan: in a suitable and becoming manner, ' he convinced that excellent person of his cousin's 'sincere, zealous, and pure intentions: he also D D 2404 DYNASTY OF THE KAFARS. ' explained the inevitable ruin which must befall the ' Saiyids* and other inhabitants of the place; making it quite evident and manifest, that during the ' assault, if the royal purpose were determined on ' the capture and storming of the fort, great num- ' bers would perish by the sharp swords and flame- ' scattering balls of the army, tremendous as the Day of Judgment; and so the reputation and ' honour f of professed Muhammedans would be- ' come a butt for the arrows of disgrace and ' infamy.' In obedience therefore to the royal orders, and from the Vizir's perfect knowledge and reliance on the mercy and humanity of the monarch (the ornament of the world), and particularly on his uniform wish and desire to promote the security and happiness of the Saiyids indiscriminately, this enlightened and amiable Minister, with feelings of sympathy, prevented the fort from being stormed, and the Saiyids and others from being dishonoured. In the interview with jVIustafa Khan, he connnuni- cated to him the happy intelligence of his majesty's overlooking what had passed, and thus bestowed on him a new existence.

CHAP. XCJX. AN' ACCOUNT OF HIS EXALTED MAJESTY CONSTITUTING AND AP POINTING MIRZA MUHAMMED HASAN, VIZIR TO THE VICEGERENT OF TEMPORAL AND SPIRITUAL POWER; AND OF THE ARRIVAL OF HARON VERDEY*, RELATIVE TO A SUSPENSION OF HOSTILITIES. A fter the restoration of tranquillity in Azarba'ijan, when his majesty's fish-like banner, bright as the sun, departing from Oujoon, shed its radiance on Teheran the capital, the incomparable Vizir f re paired to the heaven-seated, solar-throned monarch's Durbar, the resort of the world. Whereas, in con sequence of his rank as Saiyid, and previous merito rious services, he found the royal sympathy inclined in the highest degree towards him, he requested that his appointment of Vizir to the Prince Viceroy should be transferred to his eldest son, Mirza Muhammed Hasan, the quintessence of nobility and virtue, equally conspicuous and lauded for upright conduct, innate goodness, amiable qualities, superior mildness, be coming humility, pleasing manners, acute discrimi nation, eloquent language, and excellent carriage ; and that he himself should remain in devoted service at the royal threshold, the abode of the righteous. Truly his excellency's admirable son, notwithstanding * Baron Wrede. t Mirza Bazurp-,100 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. his youth, possesses the dignity of age ! Even in his first essays of acquiring experience in public affairs, he inscribed on the pages of the hearts of young and old the image of his happy disposition for business: from his earliest youth he was blessed with, and honoured for, a mild and humble character; and was universally allowed to be perfect in nobleness of manner, elevation of sentiments, dignity of birth, and gifted with rare talents : ' His heart is free alike from avarice and parsimony; ' Pride and malignity find no place in his soul; ' Towards his enemy he indulges no bitterness; ' His friend's eye never perceives a frown on his forehead.' The Vizir's honoured son, from the consideration of his virtues and talents, was favourably regarded by the climate-conquering sovereign; and on ac count of the distinguished services rendered by Mirza Bazurg, the king considered attention to his wishes as indispensable and necessary : therefore his request met with acceptance before the throne of solar splendor; so that the office of Vizir to his highness, the Vicegerent of temporal and spiritual power, was entrusted to Mirza Muhammed Hassan, and his breast and shoulders enveloped in royal robes, radiant as the sun: at the same time, Mirza Bazurg being exalted to the glorious dignity of Ka'im Makam, and Vice Minister at the exalted court, obtained superiority over his equals and co- temporaries, by the investiture of splendid robes, and by quaffing goblets of multiplied proofs of royal esteem and favour. He was then ordered to Azarba'ijan, for the purpose of establishing his for tunate son in his official duties: which done, he wasDYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. lOT directed to return to a permanent residence at the threshold exalted as Saturn. It happened, on his excellency's arrival in Azarba'ijan, that the Russian Bulkunik, Baron \ erdey, on the part of Tormasoff, the Russian General, repaired to the presence of the Prince Viceroy, bearing representations to this pur port : ' 1 hat a despatch has been received from the ' Russian Emperor, clearly demonstrating and ex plaining his desire to be in friendship with the em- piie ot Iran: I am therefore commanded to arrange the terms of peace; and have given orders that hostility and opposition, on our part, should at ' present cease. If the Ministers of Iran should ' determine also that a cessation of hostilities, ' during the interval of the exchange of envoys and ' reciprocal counsels, take place on theirs, the sun ' of permanent peace will probably shine on every ' region and city: and, through this peace and ' union, both kingdoms will enjoy that tranquillity ' which will enable the merchants and artificers of ' both countries, with perfect ease, and deliverance ' from every suspicion of injury, to employ them- ' selves zealously in their respective modes of profit ' and gain. In consequence of this, I have written ' express pacific orders to the different comman- ' dants along the frontier, and have on every side ' folded up and laid by the carpets of hostility: I ' therefore request from you a similar measure. ' But as the suspension of hostilities depends on ' this, that I should have the honour of meeting ' the Prince Viceroy, or have an interview with ' Mirza Shafia,the Prime Minister, or Mirza Bazurg,408 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. ' the Vice Minister, on the frontier of some part of ' our territory, I have therefore despatched Baron ' Verdey in charge of this Letter, and expect to ' attain the object of my hope.' Baron Verdey, also, in a personal conference with the Prince Viceroy, represented*, ' That should this proposal ' be accepted, the Russian Ministers would with- ' out doubt presently deliver up the invaded dis- ' tricts to the government of the victorious empire: ' that merely for the sake of opening a communica- ' tion through couriers, the Russians will retire from ' the places possessed now by them, without dispute, ' or advancing any unreasonable pretensions: and ' in order to observe the rules of concord, they will ' withdraw the steps of aggression ; and for the ' future, no transaction contrary to the dictates ot ' friendship shall proceed from them : for the pru- ' dent counsellors of Russia well know, by experi- ' ence, that all this time they have not derived the ' smallest advantage from the countries occupied ' by them; on the contrary, in those districts they ' have not, for a single instant, been able to quatt ' a draught of water, without being exposed to dread ' and alarm, and terror of an attack from the war- ' riors, fierce as tigers, formidable as lions: that ' besides this, numbers of men, and considerable ' sums of Russian money, have been wasted during ' so many years of battle; from which the funds ' and revenues of the Russian empire have been ' lavished to protect territories and frontier, which * In the Notes will be found some remarks on this representa tion of Baron Wrede's, which I have endeavoured to translate as literally as possible.DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 109 ' have produced every gradation of perplexity, suf- u fering, loss of life, and evil fortune.' The Prince Viceroy attached belief to these as sertions ; and with reason ; for such an arrange ment and final decision was in strict conformity to the views of the wise and intelligent. The Prince Viceroy therefore, on obtaining permission from the celestial court, wrote thus, in reply to Tormasoff's declarations: ' The presence of our 'royal train on the frontier cannot take place ' before the period arrives for the triumphant ex- &lt;( pedition, which occurs every year, at the stated time : Mirza Muhammed Shafia, also, the Prime ' Minister, who like an accident inheres to sub- ' stance, and is always in attendance on the just ' monarch's victorious stirrup, cannot possibly ' proceed to the frontier and leave the king: but ' after the celebration of the Nurooz, the profound ' and enlightened Vizir, Mirza Bazurg, will set out, ' according to our orders, for the purpose of com- ' pletely settling the affairs of Karachehdagh, and ' nieet you concerning the suspension of hostilities.' His highness next laid strict injunctions on the commanders of the frontier to sheath the sword of hostility and discord, and in no respect to deviate from these commands. And Baron Verdey, in order to terminate the objects contemplated by him, remained at Tabreez; and despatched a courier with the exalted Regent's answer, to inform Torma- soff of the exact state of affairs. During this time, however, a body of troops from Shirwan made a sudden incursion, irresistible as the visionary form his mistress makes at midnight on the sleepingDYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. lover's heart, into Mughan, and drove off from the tribes of Karachehdagh nearly 20,000 head of sheep. The above tribes also, through fear of the Prince-Viceroy's displeasure, advanced not to encounter or oppose the invaders, but represented the affair to the Ministers of the auspicious pre sence, who laid this transaction before BaronVerdey; and he, having ascertained the truth of this repre hensible conduct, immediately despatched a mes senger to Tormasoff, and exhibited great confusion. Tormasoff wrote thus in answer : ' This movement has taken place against my orders: a body of Turks, under no restraints of fear, have laid this ambush to take away the sheep. W hen my in terview with the Prince Viceroy takes place, it will be fully explained to him, and 1 shall acquit myself of this scandal: at present, from indigna- ' tion at such an event, my face streams with ' agony At this very time, a body of Russians came by surprise on Makri in Karabagh, which until now had been subject to Abul Faty Khan, as governor for the Prince Viceroy: but on the mere arrival of this intelligence, and the communi cation of it to Baron Verdey, he despatched a mes senger to the above-mentioned Russians, stating his excessive confusion ; and they immediately retired from Makri, without molesting any one; so that no one could ascertain their motive either for ad vance or retreatf. As the Prince Viceroy always felt inclined to oblige and please the envoys of friends and ioes, he * Literally, ' My face is black.' t They retreated iu consequence of the Baron s orders.DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 41 [ ordered such conduct to be observed to Baron Verdey, that the obligations for so great favours would have covered with utter confusion any one endowed with even ordinary intelligence. As an example of the many favours conferred, this was one . he was permitted to go wherever he pleased, and to maintain unrestrained intercourse with what ever persons he thought proper, until the day of final audience; and on his departure, he received abundant donations and costly dresses. In return for these, he despatched a firman from the Emperor of Russia to the Commandant Governor of Ganjah (who had been at Tabreez two years before), order ing him not only to excite commotions, insurrec tions, and plots, but also to excite the Russian deserters from Ganjah and Gurjistan, who had been delivered up to him, to renew their services against Persia. The Commandant, however, did not keep tins transaction concealed, but, in discharge of dnty +, revealed it to his royal highness, and fully submitted to him all the details in a faithful repre sentation.

The Vice gerent of temporal and spiritual power, after the festival of the Nurooz, directed the face of energy to the transactions of State concerns ; and although the plunder of the sheep from the tribes of Kara- chehdagh, joined to the advance and retreat of the Russians in Makri in Karabagh, as well as the insidious suggestions of Baron Verdey to the Com mandant, with proofs of the treachery, artifice, and corrupt practices of Tormasoff, were clearly demon strated, yet, in addition to this, new snow arrived, that Tormasoff, putting in practice treachery and artifice against Suleiman Khan, Waly of Bazachuk, had adopted the appearance of friendship towards him, and testified a desire for an interview with him; but that during the conference, Tormasoff, unawares, introduced a body of men, who arrested the Khan, and took him prisoner to Teflis.

The Ka'im Makam was directed to rear the fortunate pavilion, in the exalted name of the august State, at a short distance fromTormasoff's encampment; and there, removing the curtain from before the face of the object of de sire, proceed to explanations; when, having taken away the veil from the face of mystery, the Bride of Armistice, decorated with all her ornaments, should appear in full splendor in the midst of the assembly: but if the Ka'im Makam found TormasofTs conduct to be the result of treachery and deceit, he was directed immediately to return: and if Torma- soff should carry his insincerity so far as to lay plans of treachery, hostility, or manifest an attempt to de tain him, he was then to exert himself to the utmost, totally indifferent about putting him and the Russians to death, heedless that such an act might cause his own destruction and that of his retinue. The Ka'im Makam proceeded according to order; and Torma soff, at first, pointed out three places successively for the interview, but suddenly repented : however, at last he definitively settled the Fort of Askeran, in that territory, as the place of meeting; whither the Ka im Makam, acting in conformity to his instruc tions, proceeded without scruple. TormasofF, also.4.14 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. in his external deportment, besides observing the ceremonial of the Istikbal *, exhibited humble and submissive conduct, rendering the envoy marks of respect and attention which far exceeded all that could be imagined, without omitting a single par ticular of what polished society requires. The fir mans f of both States being produced in a becoming and suitable manner, the basis for the articles of the armistice were laid down, according to the interests of both parties : there occurred not the smallest difference or excess in the style and titles of the sovereigns of the two mighty realms; nor did a single point contrary to the settled rules and regu lations happen on either side: however, Torma- solF at last swerved from Baron Verdey's declara tions and his own written sentiments, relative to the sheep plundered in Karabagh : in addition to which, while the Na'ib-al-wazaret {i .e. Mirza Bazurg) re mained at Askeran, the Commandant again des patched a Russian force to Makri; so that when the Mirza learned the Russian claims for entering into possession of Makri, and the extent of those pre tensions, he at the same time heard the following unsatisfactory and frivolous reasons and apologies: ' That previous to this, the Russian troops have ' occasionally occupied that territory; that Makri ' is a district in Karabagh, and is now actually in ' possession of their troops: and so their claims ' and pretensions to it are well grounded.' The * A procession formed to give a man of consequence the meet ing ; and the more numerous this is, and the greater distance ^ advances, the greater the respect designed to be testified, t That is, the credentials.DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 415 Na'ib, agreeably to the orders of his highness the Prince Viceroy, for this reason broke off* the dis cussion relative to the armistice, and made prepa rations for returning. Tormasoff, again exerting himself to keep up appearances, at the time of the envoy s departure, increased, beyond all description, his demonstrations of attention, respect, and pomp of reception : but even if he had been desirous of treating them as he did Suleiman Khan, Waly of Bazachuk, he could have obtained no advantage, on account of the bravery of the intrepid Ghoolams composing the Mirza's retinue ; and the solution of the problem would not have accorded with Torma- soff s premises. Although, finally, Makri, after many vicissitudes of war and great loss of men on both sides, from the decrees of Fate and the sanction of Destiny, fell under the Russian power, Faty Aly Khan however obliged all the people of the place and of the neighbouring districts to remove to the opposite side of the Aras ; and, by the Prince-Vice roy's order, the government of Dizmar was conferred on and entrusted to him. The tribes and clans of Karabagh also, in order to escape from the losses they suffered from Pir Kuly Khan Kajar, who, by the prince's order, had repeatedly made plundering incursions among them, were dispersed in separate bodies, in the direction of Nakhshiwan and other strong positions; so that there remained not a trace of population in Karabagh, excepting Fort Panah- abad, and four or five places of difficult access, situated in the mountains; which they turned into fortified posts, and conveyed thither whatever was required for a permanent abode.

CHAP. CI. AN ACCOUNT OF VARIOUS EVENTS ; AND OF THE ERECTION OF FORT ABBAS-ABAD, AFTER THE EUROPEAN MODE; WITH A DESCRIPTION OF THE SAME. A bout the end of spring, when the steppe of Oujoon, through hope of the auspicious arrival of the exalted majesty of the King of kings, became an object of envy to the rose-bowers of Paradise, the eagle -faced standard took up its splendid abode in that region. Although at that period the Prince Viceroy ho noured by his presence the steppe of Dukchan, yet, through intense affection, he proceeded with the greatest expedition, in the course of twelve hours, to the Istikbal of the monarch endowed with Jam- shid-like virtues, and so accomplished his purpose of kissing the royal stirrup. On his arrival, the royal banners, bright as the heavens, were in the plains of Sultanieh ; and orders were given to his highness Prince Muhammed Aly Khan to advance with a countless force of cavalry and infantry to Erivan: the prince therefore proceeded to the steppe o Karabaghlar in Nakhshiwan, where he waited the arrival of the Prince-Viceroy's fortunate train. HisDYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 417 exalted majesty, the shadow of the Almighty, did not permit the Prince Viceroy to remain long at the gracious presence ; and, on his departure, it was thus arranged—' That the expeditions to Ganjah and G urjistan should for this year be laid aside, and the Prince directed to execute measures necessary for ' securing the frontier; for which purpose the ^ Fort Ahhas-ahad (which was to be constructed '• after the European manner) should be completed, ' and put into a state of perfect strength, and abun- ' dantly supplied with all kinds of stores and means ' of defence.' * The Prince Viceroy, therefore, exerted himself, agreeably to the tenor of the world- obeyed mandate. The triumphant' prince's engi neers had received the principles of fortificationln the European manner from Monsieur Lamy, the French engineer (who was unequalled in sagacity, intellect, and profoundness, and completely skilled' 111 tllls scle nce, as well as all others connected with mathematics and calculation) ; and had also learned from him the mathematical sciences, the way of oiming lines, fixing the place of encampment, ar resting the progress of the enemy by throwing up works of defence and entrenchments, and the con struction of forts after the European manner. Having onned the plan of the fort, they laid the founda- of it. Aslnaf Khan Damawendy, an ancient servant of the State, and who, by his defence of tnvan, when besieged by Godovitch, had attained eminent skill in these matters, was appointed to supt i intend the completion ol this new place; and m the course of three months the fort was completed; * ot this fort some remarks will be made in the Notes E E418 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. in the description of which, it is sufficient to say, that Sir Harford Jones, Baronet, the Ilchy of the exalted English Government, on beholding the wooden bridge erected over the Aras and connected with the fort, seizing with his teeth the finger of astonishment, openly acknowledged (notwithstand ing the enmity, exceeding all description, then sub sisting between the two States ot France and Eng land), ' That perfect skill in fortification must be ' ascribed to Monsieur Lamy : truly he has not in ' all Europe his equal in that science!'* The same ambassador also observed: ' The ability to execute ' such a work, in so short a time, is peculiar to the ' powerful empire of Iran : truly in no other king- ' dom on earth would it be possible, in the course ' of two years, to erect such a fortress, and provide ' it so completely with all the requisite supplies. * I do most well remember this occurrence: my praise was extremely equivocal. The words were, ' Nothing like this co ' have been erected any where but in Persia; and. the execution o ' the work equals the design.'

CII. AN ACCOUNT OF HIS HIGHNESS PRINCE MUHAMMED ALY KHAN ATTACKING THE ENTRENCHMENTS OF HAMAMLU; AND OF HIS RETURN, AFTER MAKING A SUCCESSFUL INROAD ON SOME KOZAK TRIBES. Whilst the Prince Viceroy halted at Nakhshiwan, he gave the triumphant Prince Muhammed Aly Khan a plan of operations, and detached his high ness to the steppe of Abaran, in Erivan. On re ceiving this plan, the prince, on two occasions, ordered the champions distinguished by victory to advance on Hamamlu, under the command of Ismail Beg Damaghany (Ghoolam Pesh Khidmat Bashy of the royal court), and other enterprising leaders; who, having encountered Paratnagin, slew many of the Russians, and attacked them with great vigour. The illustrious prince was next ordered to chastise the refractory Shams-ud-deen Lu, and other tribes of Kozak and Ganjah; and also to give battle to General Nibalsin, who was posted in that country. The Prince Viceroy, actuated by fraternal sympathy and brotherly affection, traversed, with the rapidity of the dispersion of the Sabeansf, the whole distance, j and accompanied his highness. Thus these two I noble-minded princes, like two shining stars, each at the head of a division of the valorous army composed of musketeers and infantry, manifested a desire of capturing the entrenchments of Hamamlu : however, 't so happened, that the army, during two successive ( lays, encountered such violent rains as nearly exemplified the effects of Noah's flood, and thus t For this dispersion, see Sale's Koran, antl Notes. e e 2420 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. the troops became unfit for active operations. the arms and ammunition of the victorious troops were rendered useless, by wet: the artillery waggons, from the deluges of rain, were buried in clay; and water played out of the musket-barrels, like so many fountains: while, in the mean time, the Rus sians were securely posted behind the walls of their towers and entrenchments, quite prepared for the assault. On this account, the Prince Viceroy, seeing that no advantage could result from the attack, did not allow his troops to make the attempt; and as he had another object in view, without stopping to blockade the place, he detached Prince Muhammed Aly Khan to Ganjah; and he himself, attended by happiness and prosperity, returned to Erivan. On the prince's arrival in Ganjah, he fell in with tic Kozak tribes, and captured from them innumerab e flocks and herds. General Nibalsin, on hearing tins, with the Russian troops and the Kozak ca\a r } joined to that of Shams-ud-deen Lu, collected al is force in every direction, formed it into se \eial dru sions round the plunder that had been taken, an , being now quite prepared, begun the battle. 16 magnanimous prince detached divisions of his ti oops on every side, to meet the attack; and in the e ginning of the action displayed such exeitions as utterly amazed the beholders: at last, the Russian and their adherents being entirely discomfited, t e youthful and triumphant prince, with the train a tendant on the victorious stirrup, returned h om t ia region to Erivan, crowned with complete succes&gt;, bringing with them heads of foes, spoil, number es captives, and abundance of plunder. As itdynasty of the kajars. 421 been ascertained at this conjuncture, from the tenor of successive reports, that TormasofF had returned from Sad Kalu to Teflis, it therefore became evident that, in consequence of the arrival of the hosts of winter, there was no probability of further active hostilities: on which the Viceroy sent Prince Mu- hammed Aly Khan, with most of the troops, to the royal Durbar; and earnestly entreated his majesty not to expose himself any longer to the privations of halting at Oujoon, a situation which, from intense cold, is unfit for winter-quarters; but to turn the royal standard towards the seat of empire. CHAP. cm. AN ACCOUNT OF THE PROFESSIONS OF FIDELITY MADE BY SHAIKH ALY KHAN BADKOBAH, AND MUSTAFA KHAN SHIRWANY ; AND OF IBRAHIM KHAN K A JAR BEING ORDERED TO THE BANKS OF THE KUR. It has been previously stated, that Ibrahim Khan Kajar had been ordered to the banks of the Kur : the cause of which order was this. Selim Khan Shakaky and Husain Kuly Khan Badkobah, who were sheltered under the merciful shadow of the victorious empire, had obtained the honour of the royal audience in the steppe of Oujoon : the agents of Shaikh Aly Khan arrived also with representa tions from him, the general purport of which was, that some chief might be ordered with a strong de tachment to Mughan : also, that money should be issued from the royal treasury to Shaikh Aly Khan, and to Mustafa Khan Shirwany, who now repented 0 f his former misdeeds, and had united himself with Shaikh Aly Khan in allegiance to the exalted422 dynasty of the kajars. empire, and in hostility to the Russians, and wished much to establish the power ol Selim Khan in Shakaky: also, that Husain Kuly Khan having joined Shaikh Aly Khan, they should, in concert, assemble their Lezghee partisans in Kubeh, and with then united forces expel or destroy the Russians of that country. Although his exalted majesty, the shadow of God, placed no great reliance on these proposals, yet, in order to prove his attention to their wishes, he agreed to their demands, and appointed to this expedition Ibrahim Khan Kajar, with a division ot the undaunted army, granting at the same time the necessary supplies. It was then arranged, that if evidence of true service should appear on the side of Mustafa Khan Shirwany, or if the propositions of Shaikh Aly Khan could be depended on, and either of them should sincerely desire his crossing the river Kur, he was to proceed in that direction, and not relax in giving them effectual aid and assistance. but in the opposite case, he should make an incur sion into Karabagh, and conduct Husain Kuly Khan to Shaikh Aly Khan (with whom he was most de sirous to form a junction); furnishing him at the same time with the requisite number of cavalry and the necessary funds. Ibrahim Khan, acting in con formity to these arrangements, halted some time at Aslanduz in Mughan, and sent some intelligent persons along with Selim Khan's agents to Mustafa Khan; but not the smallest sensation of the odour of sincerity greeted the senses of these messengers: he therefore sent off Husain Kuly Khan Badkobab to Shaikh Aly Khan, with a sufficient force of cavalry and the subsidy requested by him for the LezgheeDYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 423 partisans: but as there did not appear from that quarter the smallest prospect of success, he then, agreeably to the prescribed plan of operations, made a hostile incursion into Karabagh; and having ob tained riches, goods, commodities of every descrip tion, and herds and flocks surpassing all calculation, returned from thence to Aslanduz, where he remained until Pir Kuly Khan Kajar, who was in attendance on the Prince-Viceroy's victorious stirrup, was sum moned from Erivan by the royal command, and appointed to defend the frontier of Mughan. The Vice Minister, Mirza Bazurg, was also ordered to take a division of the army, both horse and foot, from the royal camp, and deliver them over to Pir Kuly Khan; and to return, when he had properly arranged affairs in Dizmar and Karachehdagh. The Ka'im Makam punctually executed these orders, powerful as those of Destiny; and Ibrahim Khan Kajar having been summoned to the heaven-resem bling Durbar, came to the royal camp. Pir Kuly Khan, immediately on arriving in Karachehdagh, proceeded with the victorious troops to Karabagh, in concert with Hajy Muhammed Karaguzlu, go vernor of Karachehdagh. On crossing the Aras, he made a rapid advance towards Mehedy Kuly Khan, governor of Karabagh, and the Russians stationed in the Fort of Askeran to defend that country; and proposed to himself to make them taste the draught of extirpation and conquest. Although the victo rious troops appeared as if scattered about in the environs of the fort, in the hope of tempting the garrison to come out and give battle, yet the enemy did not venture on such a measure, or move a single424 dynasty of the kajars. step to meet them in the field. Pir Kuly Khan therefore proceeded from thence to plunder and harass the other strongholds along the River Tatai. On arriving at the first of these fortified posts, con sidering that the clans of Jabreellu had placed all their wealth, cattle, and most of their families in this first post, which was situated in an exceedingly steep and strong position, and also that the people of the place had discharged several shots at the tiger-capturing troops, Pir Kuly Khan ordered the champions of the faith to take it. These bia\e men, without bestowing a thought on the difficulty and steepness of the road, or on the strength of the place, during three successive hours kindled the flames of hostility with the flashing of their sharp- edged swords, and, after repeated assaults, took this fortified post, by manly charges, by the devouring flame of the drawn sword, and by the lightnings ot the musket: the inhabitants of the place were to tally destroyed, the men being consumed by the merciless sword; the women and children stiung in the noose of captivity. Their herds, flocks, stores, and wealth, were carried away ; so that of all their former opulence, which surpassed the limits oi calculation, not a single thing was now left remain ing. After this, Pir Kuly Khan raised the standaid of departure for Karachehdagh; and at the same time orders were given to him to send a body of troops, to bring by force, to this side of the Aras, a tribe ot the Chabbiyanhu of Karachehdagh, who had passed over into Karabagh, and there pursued the repre hensible path of vacillating obedience. Pir Kuly Khan, acting according to these instructions, obligeddynasty of the kajars. 425 them, with the tribe of Yusefanlu, to remove ; and conducted both to this side of the Aras. When the result of the expedition was represented to the Prince Viceroy, from respect to the reputation of True Religion, positive instructions were issued to ll a jy Muhammed Khan to ransom the prisoners, whether Shias or Sunnis, from the victorious troops, and restore them to their families. CHAP. CIV. AN ACCOUNT OF HOSTILITIES BETWEEN THE VICTORIOUS TROOPS AND THE WAHHABEE ARABS. A mong the victories obtained this year by the pru dence of the unequalled sovereign's Ministers, is to be mentioned that over the Wahhabees. Whereas, according to what has already been related, the march of the Heaven-aided army, by way of Bussorah and Bagdad, was contrary to the policy of the Othman Ministers, and could not therefore be effected, the Government of Iran resolved that the troops should proceed by way of Muskat, to make war on that people. By various acts of liberality they inspired the Imam of Muskat with great hopes, so that he also, girding his loins with the mantle of obedience and zeal, collected all his forces. Prince Husain Aly Mirza, governor of Farsistan, appointed a body of troops, commanded by Sadik Khan Afshar, to advance, on this expe dition, by way of Muskat, with instructions to co operate zealously with the Imam. From the tenor of the representations addressed to the Prince, it appears, that, on the arrival of the victorious troops on the confines of Sand's territories, the conflagration426 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. of battle and slaughter, in different encounters, blazed on both sides ; and that in these skirmishes many of the Wahhabees were slain, some of their forts fell into the hands of the victorious Govern ment, and several of their chiefs were either slain or made prisoners. CHAP. CV. AN ACCOUNT OF TORMASOFF ARRESTING SULEIMAN KHAN, GO\EHNOR OF BAZACHUK ; AND OF HUSAIN KHAN, COMMANDER OF AKHSA- KAH, BEING DEFEATED BY THE RUSSIANS, T he Russian General Tormasoff having advanced with a considerable force to the confines of Teflis and Bazachuk, sent this message to Suleiman Khan, governor ol Bazachuk: Let us meet to ' hold a friendly conference, and lay open the doors ' of peace and prosperity to our mutual fortunes:' but secretly, in the way oi fraud and deceit, he prepared the means of seizing the Khan's person. When the interview was concluded, through the co -operation of some persons in Bazachuk who, to all appearance, were zealously devoted to the governor, but who, in reality, had entered into a compact with Tormasoff, the latter posted himself in the ambush of fraud and deception, and taking Suleiman Khan prisoner, carried him off to 1 eflis. After some time, he appointed certain Russian officers to convey Suleiman Khan, as prisonei, by night, from Teflis to Petersburg; but he one night, at an entertainment having learned this project, by con summate prudence extricated himself from the as sembly, and fled, with a few persons; and, by thef DYNASTY OF THE KA.IARS. 427 most ingenious measures, and changing his dress, passed through the gates; outside which, having found a horse and guide prepared, he set off with the greatest speed. It is said by the wise. Give not the meed of wisdom to him who avoids the net of misfortune, ' But to him who, when fallen into the snare, delivers himself from it by force of reflection ; ' Who, taking Reason on board for a pilot, and hoisting- a bold sail, ' Steers the bark of his life through the whirlpool of destruction, to a secure haven.' In short, Suleiman Khan reached the district of Akhsakah, and despatched his DiwanBegy, Suleiman Beg (his relative and zealous friend), to the imperial court, the asylum of the world. He entreated that a distinguished firman might be issued to Husain Khan Sardar, and Sheriff Pasha, governor of Akh sakah ; and also that an order should emanate from the court magnificent as heaven, to assist him with the necessary funds for equipping a force. His re quests met with acceptance; and Husain Khan Sar dar, pursuant to royal orders, set out for Akhsakah with much treasure and many brave soldiers. On the Sardar's arrival, there came to him some inha bitants of Kartil and Kara Kulkhan, who had been reduced to the greatest affliction by the evil conduct of the Russians, and who now expressed their wish that he should order Liwan Mirza (son to the Waly of Gurjistan) to repair to that country. Husain Khan Sardar granted their request, and deputed him to Kartil with a suitable retinue. After this, Su leiman Pasha came to Bazachuk, and fought several times against the Russians of that country; many of whom were slain, and the others retired discomfited m \428 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. and dispirited, so that in the district of Achuk only one fort remained in their possession. Liwan Mirza also, on arriving in Kartil, assembled a nu merous force of the inhabitants of Kaitil Da\\cis tind Kara Kulkhan, and exerted himself zealously in carrying on hostilities against the Russians. But Sheriff Pasha, governor of Akhsakah, who, until that moment, had never been secure from the ag gressions of the Russians, and was continually exposed to the attacks of Selim Pasha, the former governor, who had entered into a treaty with them, now found his condition in every respect fiee fiom embarrassment, by the assistance he received from the victorious State and from Husain Khan s expe dition. When Husain Khan reached Akhsakah, as he confidently reckoned on the due arrangement and order of Sheriff Pasha's affairs, and counted on his measures for guarding his frontier, he no longer observed the maxims of prudence and vigilance, nor ever posted picquets in the approaches and roads: however, it appears Sheriff Pasha's affairs were still in disorder; for a Russian division advanced unper- ceived, during the night, by a route in which no picquets had been placed ; and coming on the Sar- dar by surprise, made a general discharge of mus ketry and artillery in the vicinity of the camp*. * The Russians, on this occasion, were on the point, not onl) of capturing the Sardar, but also a Georgian lady who was with hun in his tent. The Sardar was very old, and more than very plain, and the prince, speaking of the business to me, made a sort of bou- mot in Persian, by saying, the Sardar escaped captivity, and the lady missed a release. I must however do my old friend, the Sardar, the justice to say, that a braver, more generous, hospitable old gentleman never existed;—but to these good qualities, there wen some serious moral drawbacks.DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. The Sardar and his army were quite unprepared for such an untoward event; and were some awake, some asleep. In this state, being thrown into the greatest disorder, they quitted their camp; which the Russians entered on one side, and commenced a general plunder. At this moment, Mirza Aly Nakky Khan Fandarsaky of Asterabad charged them with his division, and, grappling with them like a fire with brambles, gave them a severe check, and obtained many heads, much spoil, and arms. The Russians on this retired; and Husain Khan Sardar also, not judging a longer continuance in that country to be advantageous, withdrew, in order to concert future measures against the Russians, and arrived at the Prince-Viceroy's camp. On the return of Prince Muhammed Aly Khan to Oujoon, attended by his forces, the Sardar entreated that a division of Sar- baz, Ghoolams, and musketeers might be appointed to accompany him to reduce some of the entrenched posts in Pembak. The Prince Viceroy agreed to his request; and assigned for this service Muhammed Beg Kajar Afshar, the general, and Kasim Beg, commander of the Ghoolam musketeers; who there fore, with their forces, accompanied the Sardar. On the 23d of Ramazan, the troops of the expedition urged on the charger of hostile incursion to Kara Kilisia in Pembak. Although the snow and ice blocked up the roads, and notwithstanding the in tensity of the cold was such that the blood was nearly frozen in the veins of the soldiers, the infantry traversed in one day and a night a route of twenty- seven farsangsf. At eight farsangs from Pembak, t That is, near 108 Eno-lish miles. Reader I if you believe this, recollect it as the most wonderful march on record.430 DYNASTY OF THE K A JARS. having drawn out in order and regularity their army in array, they renewed their march, and arrived two hours before morning-break, at the entrenchments of Hajy Kara, where they halted a short time. The Sardar there sent out five scouts from the Sarbaz to the vicinity of the Russian entrenchments, to bring him intelligence, and procure every information, so that he might acquire an accurate knowledge of their acts and designs, their proposed point of at tack, and all requisite particulars. These scouts *, having met two Russian picquets outside the en trenchments, took them alive, and brought them to the Sardar; and he, being apprehensive that the capture of the Russian picquets might cause the enemy to be on the alert, as soon as morning drew near, advanced with his whole force against the works. The Russians were standing watchfully at their post; and as the troops came up, it being still dark, they began to pour on them flames of hosti lity, and exerted themselves vigorously in the fight and contest: notwithstanding this, the foe-subdu ing troops made a general assault in all directions, entered the entrenchments, and, without leaving the Russians any way of escape, encompassed them like a circle. Thus they took by storm these exceedingly strong entrenchments, furnished with two pieces of cannon, which were contiguous to the fortified posts of many Russian divisions, and to several villages full of Armenian musketeers, and several thousand cavalry posted at Ikun. They slew all the Russians found in the entrench ments ; and took away, as prisoners, the families and * This is most literally translated.DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 431 children of the adjacent Armenian village. In short, they delivered themselves up to slaughter, plunder, and burning, until sunrise; and as many Russian soldiers had concealed themselves in the houses of the Armenians, they set them all on fire, and kin dled the flames of destruction under the foundation of their existence ; returning, crowned with com plete success, after spiking the guns, and with the wealth, flocks, and herds of the Armenians, and various sorts of plunder. The Russians of the en trenched post nearest to Hajy Baba, imagining that by threatening an attack they might intimidate the victorious champions and probably recover the plunder, followed them some little distance; but on the Ghoolam Tufungchees turning round and discharging their field-pieces, the range of which exceeds that of the camel-guns, several of the Rus sians were slain and others wounded, so that the remainder turned back to their post without at taining their object. The Sardar, by the result of this expedition against the Russians, cleared himself from censure f; and bringing with him the heads of the slain, the prisoners, and much plunder, re turned with suitable splendor to the presence of the Prince VicerCy, who munificently recompensed all employed on this service, in proportion to their respective grades. t On having before been caught napping.432 dynasty of the kajars.

Among the numerous means adopted for repe ing invasion, and important methods employed lor dis charging flames and hurling thunderbolts (a science which has at no period been current in Iran), the most remarkable is that of the English artillery train, one of which, along with skilful Englis i gun ners, balls, and abundance of requisite stores, Oe- neral Malcolm Behadur brought, by way ot m- dustan and Farsistan, to the court, magnificent as the heavens.

CHAP. CV1I. AN ACCOUNT OF THE MANAGEMENT OF AFFAIRS ALONG THE BAGDAD FRONTIER BEING ENTRUSTED TO THE PRINCE VICEROY. As Abdurrahman Pasha of Baban, governor of the Fortress of Chulan, had formerly resorted to the protection of the Iranian Government, the Othman Ministers, who were always apprehensive lest, through his means, the Persian Government should endeavour to get possession of Bagdad, this year appointed Halet Effendi, the former * Reis-al-Kitab (Under Secretary) of the Othman State, to conciliate and soothe Abdurrahman Pasha, and to put Sulei man Pasha, who kept no measures with either Persia or Turkey, to death. His highness Prince Mohammed Aly Mirza, governor of Kermanshahun, Luristan, and Arabistan, on whom depended the settlement of Abdurrahman Pasha's affairs, and those of his hostages, felt no inclination to second this measure on the contrary, from the high mind natural to youth and royal birth, he was disposed to save him, notwithstanding the prince disapproved of many of the measures of Suleiman Pasha.

Othman Government; and therefore determined that friendship with Turkey should be so strictly kept in view, that neither injury nor offence might arise between the Governments of Turkey and Iran. The Prince Viceroy was therefore ordered, in con cert with Prince Muhammed Aly Mirza, to decide on these important concerns, and see that no inva sion of that kingdom should take place. Halet Effendi, agreeably to his orders, deposed Suleiman Pasha, through the aid of Abdurrahman Pasha; who also having engaged in battle against him, took him prisoner, and put him to death; after which, without waiting for a firman from the Porte, he gave the appointment to Abdallah Aka, a Georgian, one of the former Pasha's dependants. Halet Ef fendi, on beholding Abdurrahman's selfishness and want of principle, became exceedingly angry, and changed his preceding conduct towards him : which Abdurrahman Pasha not being able to endure, treated him contemptuously in a general assembly. Shortly after this, he despatched to the royal Dur bar, Ahmed Aka, one of the most distinguished personages of Irak Araby (and formerly styled Ahmed Chellaby), to explain the degree of his zeal and attachment towards the immortal empire. As the frontier concerns along the whole line of the Othman territory bordering on Persia were, pur suant to the royal decree, committed to the Prince Viceroy, therefore Yason Zadeh, Abdul Wahib Ef fendi, the Turkish ambassador, (whose arrival at the Durbar, resplendent as the mansions of Saturn, shall shortly be noticed by our descriptive pen,) was ordered to reside in attendance on the prince:DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 435 and as the prince was uniformly desirous of in creasing the amity between the two States, and of breaking up the road of discord laid out by the disturbers of the existing friendship, he was com manded, at the same time that he paid the closest attention to whatever occurred on the Bagdad fron tier, to arrange and settle definitively the important interests of the Border Government of his highness Muhammed Aly Mirza, governor of Kermansha- hun, Arabistan, and Luristan. As there remained in Azarba'ijan no matter of sufficient importance to arrest his majesty's auspicious notice, the royal standard, lofty as the heavens, was put in motion, and ultimately covered Teheran (the seat of empire) with the rays of its glory. CHAP. CVIII. A\ ACCOUNT OF TORMASOFF SETTING OUT TO SUBDUE AKHSAKAH ; AND OF HIS BEING DEFEATED BY SHERIFF PASHA. After the return to the seat of splendor of the royal train, effulgent as the stars, the Russian chief, Tormasoff, observing the country unoccupied, took advantage of the opportunity, and, having assembled a numerous army, prepared to reduce Akhsakah ; summoning to his aid the troops he had raised for the purpose of subduing Bazachuk, and encamped with his whole force in the vicinity of the city and fort of Akhsakah. Selim Pasha, the former governor (W aly) ot Bazachuk, who was always pursuing the path of hostility against Sheriff Pasha on ac count of the government of Akhsakah, on hearing this intelligence, having his mind impressed with436 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. zeal for the true religion, abandoned his opposition and enmity, and sent his son with a considerable force to assist Sheriff Pasha; he himself at the same time making preparations for carrying on active hostilities against the invaders. TormasofF and his Russians, on a night when the mantle of the lofty firmament had overspread the coruscation of the fiery stars and the hosts of darkness had enveloped the surface of the azure vault, made a general as sault, three hours before dawn, in all directions, on the city, and obtained an entrance by main force. Aga Kuluyan, Suly Beg, and other brave men, with Sheriff Pasha, governor of the place, made a brave resistance. The furnace of battle blazed till two hours before dawn, and the hands of the champions of the faith were constantly sporting with musket-balls: at that hour the affair was changed from the showering of bullets to blows with the sword and thrusts with the spear; for the army of the True Believers then came to close quarters with the Russians; so that TormasofF and his army, being routed, traversed the valley of adversity; and Sheriff Pasha, with the forces of Akhsakah, forced them out of the city, and drove them one parasang from it. The victorious troops were afterwards, by the exertions of Ameer Pasha, the Seraskier, joined by reinforcements from Erze- roum and the adjoining districts; and in two or three days, the Russians also, having repaired their losses and collected their whole force, girded their loins from all quarters to take Akhsakah by storm; so that both sides were, like salamanders, encompassed by flames. At last, however, the Turkish troops, having tucked up the skirts of resolution on thedynasty of the kajars. 437 loins of courage*, through repeated attacks with their swords, and the unceasing projection of musket and cannon balls, so defeated and dispersed the Russians, that the bond of discipline in that nume rous, foe-chasing host was rent asunder. On sus taining this defeat, they abandoned their camp, and formed a junction at three or four parasangs from Akhsakah. When these joyful tidings were conveyed by fleet couriers to the Prince-Viceroy's Durbar, splen did dresses from the royal treasury were bestowed on the bearers of them; and were also sent to Sheriff Pasha, and the other brave chiefs and or thodox champions of that region. Sheriff Pasha, in addition to a dress resplendent as the sun, was honoured by a jewel-ornamented dagger, the daz zling brilliancy of which eclipsed the splendor of the heavenly bodies : he also obtained from the royal stable a steed swift as the wind, and orna mented with a golden saddle and furniture.

The scope of these melancholy reflections is this: that the Prime Minister, the illustrious and virtuous Vizir, Mirza Muhammed Hasan, who had been this year honoured above his equals and co- temporaries by the glorious distinction of being appointed Vizir to the unparalleled Prince Viceroy, (some part of this eminent Minister's admirable manners, with some eulogiums on his praise-worthy qualities, have already been recorded by the Histo rian's pen,) being indisposed for several months, lay stretched on the couch of weakness; and the physicians had recourse to many drugs to effect his recovery, but their skill was useless.

J The aged sphere, in its lamentations over the decease of this youth, shed from its eyes the lucid tears, like falling stars; and the Prince- Viceroy's splendid moon of spiritual and temporal power, from this grievous event, became totally eclipsed. His excellency the Ka'im Makam, on beholding his son's inevitable doom, poured out floods of tears : in short, tyrannic Fortune, by this sad event, plunged the whole world into the fire of woe and affliction. The spirit of the deceased was soothed, however, by the constant reading of the oracles of the Omniscient King (i.e. the Koran), and the distribution of food to the poor and to the orphans. By the Prince-Viceroy's orders, his Mini ster's pure bier was confided to the care of Najf Aly Khan Gams; and, as he had been his friend and associate during his life, so he commanded his corpse to be conveyed, with suitable preparations and t These lines allude to the ceremonies practised by the Pilgrims, on their approach to Mecca.

AN ACCOUNT OF A DIVISION OF THE SARBAZ BEING ORDERED AGAINST THE RUSSIANS OF SHAIKHAWEEZ ; AND OF THE RUS SIANS BEING COMPLETELY DESTROYED BY THE SARBAZ. I n the midst of winter it was represented to the devoted Ministers of the illustrious and splendid Vicegerent of temporal and spiritual power, that the Russian troops, having obtained provisions and supplies from Karabagh and the other countries under their power, had collected a force in the vil lage of Shaikhaweez, an exceedingly strong position, and were now about removing them to Makri. The victorious prince, regarding the dispersion of that assemblage of infatuated persons as an impor tant object, ordered the division of Muhammed Beg Kajar, the Sarhang, with the division of Hasan Khan Dambaly, to take the strong post of Shaikh Aweez; and at a time when, from the severity of winter, all the mountains were covered with snow. These troops were commanded to cross the Aras with the greatest expedition, in the hope of sur rounding the place, and taking it by surprise. This so far succeeded, that the inhabitants received notice from the Armenians and Russians only at the instantDYNASTY OF THE KAJAKS. Ml they beheld themselves entangled in the meshes of the net of calamity. Fifteen persons had time to take up arms and weapons of defence; and retired to the roof of a church in one quarter of Shaikh Aweez, where they fortified themselves, and began firing on the assailants : the remainder of the inha bitants fell into the hands of the enterprising Sar- baz: some were slain by the musket-ball; others were dragged forth by the collar, and beheaded like sheep in the midst of a village : several of them fled, and concealed themselves in a house; on which, the Sarbaz, setting fire to some grenades made by the English, threw them through a window into the midst of the house. The grenades ex ploded ; and the people were no longer able to remain inside, but ran out; on which the Sarbaz seized and beheaded them: so that the whole popu lation was slain, with the exception of two or three persons who had taken to horse and fled at the first onset. None others escaped with life; and Shaikhaweez was completely plundered. In this affair, three or four only of the Heaven-aided force fell in the contest. The heads of the slain were fixed on the points of lances, and brought to the victorious stirrup. In return for this important ser vice, the Sarbaz were distinguished by the munifi cence of the Vicegerent of temporal and spiritual power.442 dynasty of the kajars. CHAP. CXI. THE EVENTS OF THE FORTUNATE YEAR 1226 (A. D, 1811): THE ARRIVAL OF ABDUL WAHIB EFFENDI FROM THE OTHMAN STATE, TO THE COURT MAGNIFICENT AS SATURN'S. Through the auspicious approach of the triumphant Nurooz*, the aged world resumed its youth; the gentle breezes again returned; the Sary, and the thousand-songed minstrel, poured out their strains on the rose-bush. The exalted monarch, on com pleting the festival of Nurooz, devoted himself to terminating the important concerns of the State, whether near or remote, and raised his triumphant standard to the ninth heaven. At this time the Yasonjy-zadeh, Abdul Wahib Effendi, appointed ambassador to Erivan by the Othman Government, arrived at Tabreez about the end of Zy-hajjah-ul- Haram, and, by the Prince-Viceroy's orders, the dis- * We may safely consider the celebration of the Nurooz to have taken place in the very earliest times of the Persian empire. The processions in bas-relief at Persepolis are, I think, evidently a representation of the gifts and ceremonies which took place at the Persian court on that occasion. It may happen that some of my readers may not know that the celebration of the Passover and the celebration of the Nurooz take place precisely at the same period; and that both festivals were instituted to mark the com mencement of the new year, though the Jewish one was also ap pointed to commemorate a more important event. Forster says, that ' the day of its commencement (i .e. the Passover) should to ' the Israelites be the commencement of the first month of the ' year; the period, or epoch, from whence all their future com- ' putations of time should have relation, as to its beginning. It ' appears, from subsequent passages, that the actual period or ' point of time was that of the sun's crossing the equinoctial line ' in the spring; being, according to our reckoning, on the 21st oi ' March, on what we call the vernal equinox ; when the sun, by ' the mDYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. 443 tinguished men and nobles of Tabreez went in pro cession to receive him; and he afterwards next obtained the honour of kissing the royal carpet. In the beginning of Muharram-ul-Haram, Sir Harford Jones, Bart., the English Ilchy (who was in at tendance in Tabreez upon the victorious prince's Heaven-aided train, and particularly distinguished by the Prince-Viceroy's multiplied attentions and favours), pursuant to the dictates of sincerity, con cord, and union, gave the ambassador a princely banquet, on which he spread the board of hospitality, and displayed all kinds of attention to his guests. Tables covered with whatever was excellent, fire works, joy and festivity, prevailed to such a degree, that the Prince Viceroy bestowed the highest praise on Sir Harford for the magnificence of his enter tainment : in fact, the English Ilchy had not his equal in the world in point of accomplished manners, ' the equal division of its rays, causes equal day and night all over ' the world. The name of the month, in the pre-existing Jewish ' Calendar, was Nisan; afterwards, as appears by other passages, ' it was called Abib t; but subsequently its old denomination of ' Nisan was made use of.'— F orstek's Scriptural Tracts, pri vately printed.

The time of his arrival at the royal threshold draw ing near, and the favourable time for a voyage by sea being nearly terminated; as Sir Harford Jones, who had been sent by the English Government, and summoned home at his own desire f, requested leave of departure from the imperial Durbar; agree ably to his wishes, after receiving favours beyond the power of language to describe, he was permitted to depart, and Letters expressive of perfect esteem and union with the English Government were trans mitted by him: it was also settled, that on the arrival of the new ambassador, another envoy should * There are several lines of the MS. much injured with sea- water ; so much so, that it has been with difficulty any thing can be made out. t When Earl Minto, the Governor General, conducted himself towards me in the unwarrantable manner he did, and when I had signed a Treaty of Subsidy to Persia for which I had no authority in my Instructions, I thought it but decent, by resigning my appoint ment, to relieve His Majesty's Government from any awkwardness that circumstance might occasion, as to their decision between Lord Minto and myself; and to manifest a desire, if the Preliminary and Subsidiary Treaty was disapproved, to return to England, and ac count for my conduct as speedily as possible. Reader, the subsidy granted to Persia by my Treaty was confirmed, and increased one-fifth! and my resignation was accepted.446 DYNASTY OF THE KAJARS. be sent to the English Government. In truth, the attentions shewn by the Government of Iran to Sir Harford Jones, Bart., exceed the power of de scription, and their enumeration would cause pro lixity. Among the many instances is the following: That Sir Harford having obtained permission to use, as the device of his seal, the Lion and Sun, which is the device of Iran, a royal firman was issued, that this device should be peculiar to him, and not be conferred on any other person*. A second in stance was this ; that a Chelenk f, which in Eng lish they call an Aigrette, being granted to him, should crown him with glory. In like manner, on arriving in the Prince-Viceroy's presence for the purpose of obtaining permission to depart, he was distinguished in such a manner, that no individual of the faithful and approved servants had ever at tained to the same degree of notice. On his setting out, the Ministers and courtiers of Iran, who had conceived such profound attachment to him J * *• « * * * * * * * * ife * and departed by way of Istamboul.

As the Balooch who inhabit the mountains of Bazer and Jiraft (which properly belong to Kennan) pos sess in those mountains strong positions, these two cantons have on that account been attached to Baloochistan : and as from the other cantons of Ker- man, to Benfahal, their great stronghold and capital, there extends an immense desert, totally destitute of water and cultivation, through which it is difficult for an army to pass, these people for a long time paid no taxes to the royal government. From the same cause, during the Zend dynasty, on some oc casions they were subject to incursion, ravage, and captivity; and during the present period, although they sometimes brought a trifling Peishcush to his highness Ibrahim Khan, governor of Kerman, they never submitted to pay a regular tribute : for this reason his highness appointed Abdul Hasan Khan Garus, with a division of the army, to pro ceed to that region. From the tenor of the repre sentations transmitted by his highness to the royal Durbar, and which were submitted to the perusal of the writer of these pages, it appears that Abdul Hasim Khan, by a rapid movement, advanced by surprise to the vicinity of the fort: on which a con siderable number of the Balooch, taking post out side the walls, endeavoured to prevent their further progress; but the intrepid cavalry and fire-shower ing infantry, by a slight effort, utterly discomfited them, and either slew or took the greatest part448 dynasty of the kajars. prisoners. Those who escaped the sword flying towards the fort, the undaunted champions of the Faith, being mixed with the discomfited troops, entered the place along with them ; so that the in habitants, having lost all power of resistance, and making the collar of obedience and submission the embellishment of their existence, sent their chiefs to Kerman, who settled the foundations of imposts and taxes, in such a manner, that hereafter their allegiance to the fortunate empire should be regular, and their persons and property secure. CHAP. CXIV. ACCOUNT OF THE EXPEDITION TO HERAT. A lthough Firooz Mirza, the Afghan, established public prayer* and a mint in the illustrious sove reign's name, he nevertheless extended the hand ol oppression to the wealth of the merchants, travel- lers, and inhabitants of Herat, and threw open the gates of injustice before the face of the afflicted. ^Such conduct, therefore, was followed by complaints to the royal Durbar. His highness Prince Mu- hammed Aly Mirza, governor of Khorasan, also sent agents to the royal court, soliciting leave to proceed to Herat, and requesting that an expedition be ordered against that place. Agreeably to his highness's desire, the order was given ; and a divi sion of the army, with suitable preparations and necessary stores, marched on this expedition. * That is, ordered the Kotbeh to be recited on Fridays, for the king. finis.APPENDIX, No. I. translation of the firman granting to sir harford the royal arms of persia.
