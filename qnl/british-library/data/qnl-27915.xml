Meanwhile, as in the correspondence which has previously taken place, FV'. Legation have promised to take steps for the exchange of mails between Persian Gulf Office# and Bahrein to be restored as formerly, i.e., similar to the arrangement in force before May 1939, this promise will cert ainly apply also to the arrangement for the dispatch of parcels particularly in connection with the non-payment of terminal charges.

No. 31. f510/9/42) British Legation, Tehran, ——*• 11th March, ^ ft E III i * 1 I “T /f *1 A) My Lord Marquess, i )-T £ In ny despatch No.250 of the 27th November 1940, addressed to i,he PoTmigi: Office r and repeated to the Q-overnment of In'ia under No 7142 I suggested that the controversy about the parcels taaiTf-rjcgigr Persian ports to Bahrain should be left until the more pressing matter of the letter nails had been settled. Provided that the Bahrain postal authorities revert to the use of form R,P.32, as re^onnended m the olitical Resident’s telegram No.34 of the 4th February, the question of the letter mails can, I hope, be regarded as settled, in that the Persian postal authorities should no longer refuse to accept letter mails from Bahrain or to deliver the letters to the addressees, though there remains open a subsidiary point to which reference ©8 made below in paragraph 3 of this despatch. 2. In a note No.5171, dated the 1st March, a copy of which is enclosed, che Persian Ministry of Foreign Affairs raise once more the question of the refusal of the Bahrain Post Office to accept parcels sent direct from Persia. In my reply, a copy of which is also attached. I have pointed out that the agreements recently concluded d6&amp; not cover the parcel post, and explained that the difficulty arose from the refusal of the Persian authorities to ray the terminal charges on parcels sent to Bahrain. In order, however, to foster the m^re oonciliatiry spirit w v ich we find at present in the Persian O-cvemment in the matter of Bahrain, T suggest that the Bahrain Post Office should be instructed to accept parcels despatched from Pe-sia, but that when informing the Persian Govern ment of this concession I should say that it does not denote any change whatsoever in the attitude of His Majesty’s Government in re= gard to the status of Bahrain. -lien the normal procedure is restored again, the statements of account showing arrears of terminal charges due from the Persian Government should* I suggest, be sent in again, and this should be done annually with the addition of the latest annual account. The Persian Government would probably not reply, but we should not trouble about that. If they reply that the charges are not due we should defend our position but should not, I suggest, discontinue the acceptance of parcels from Persia direct to Bahrain. 3. My note of reply to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs asks that the practice of charging double the internal rate f^om the addressee on letters sent from Bahrain to Persia shouldCnpJ be abandoned. The Persian Government will not give up entirely a practice by which they assert ther^i alleged right to Bahrain, but that they should charge a fine as well as the single postage is objectionable and I hope to induce them to compromise on thie point. ,i4.

Nevertheless His Majesty’s legation will examine the question of the p reel post without delay and will see what can be '■■one to find a solution satisfactory to both parties, 2 # Meanwhile, His ha^esty’s Legation learn that the Iranian postal authorities are requiring the addressees of letters from Bahrain to pay Double the ordinary Iranian postage. When the recent agreement was node His Majesty's Legation understood that in such cases the Iranian authorities, in order to maintain tb dr rsoint of view, would collect the Iranian postage from the addressee, and they hod no objection to that procedure. They hold, however, that to levy a fine by collecting twice the ordinary postal rate is contrary to the spirit of the agreement, an- 1 they be*j~the Imperial Ministry to have orders issued to the postal authorities concerned not to collect the double rate in future.

(W 5346/155/801) Man y thanks for your letter Ext.1651/42 of the 8th April' about telegraphic cormniinication between Bushire and Bahrein. ^ *v&lt;xL/ It is hardly worth while asking the Government of India for further details since as you point cut, it is merely a question of deciding between two alternatives i.e. the international form C 17 or the Indian internal form RP 32. While we can understand the reluctance of the Persians to use C 17 (although it is inconceivable that it will make any difference to their claim) v/e feel it is surprising that they should be prepared to use an Indian internal form even though it may be defaced. On the other hand, the use of the Indian form could do nothing to impair the Government of India’s position; in fact on the contrary, (if we follow Persian reasoning) since the effect, if any, might well be to strengthen the idea that Bahrein is an Indian dependency. In the circumstances, v/e propose, subject to your concurrence, to reply to Tehran tele gram No. 86 to the effect that we consider that RP 32 should be used (if necessary with amendment or overprinting) /provided E. \Y.
