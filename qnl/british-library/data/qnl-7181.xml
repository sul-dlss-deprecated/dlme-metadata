British Interests in 'Arabistan, 1635—1800. Direct British trade with Basrah dates from 1635, and was carried on with occasional interruptions by the East India Company until its absorp tion into the Government of India. But no direct relations with the Arabs of Dauraq and Qubban seem to have existed until the piratical tendencies of the Ka'ab tribe under Shaikh Salman became so marked as seriously to threaten British trade. With the assistance of the Turks and with the half-hearted co-operation of Karim Khan the agents at Basrah attempted naval operations in 1765 against Shaikh Salman, but with no success. Two of their boats were captured and taken up the ' river of Doraq ' {sc. Khor Buziyeh) (Saldanha, p. 193). At this time the factors of the East India Company at Basrah looked upon the Ka'ab as Turkish subjects, and applied to the Turkish authorities for assistance in obtaining compensation for the losses they had sustained. They expressed their inability to enter into direct negotiatioiis with the Ka'ab, since they were Turkish subjects. The local authorities did their best to assist the factors, but with Little result- Shaikh Salman was anxious to be dealt with as an independent potentate; he made the release of the officers and men captured with the two ships mentioned above (whose names were ' Sally ' and ' Fort William ') conditional upon the receipt from the Basrah agent of a ' Treaty of peace to be continued on the old footing between the Honourable Company and himself which was consented to, finding that he would not discharge the gentlemen on any other terms.' ' Having acquainted the Government {sc. Turkish) of all these proceedings they approved of our sending it to him, but desired we would look (upon) the said paper as a matter of form, only calculated on purpose to get our people out of his hands, saying that there was no reliance to be had on his promises, and that he would soon, as aforetime, render the treaty as of no validity.' Their fleet would continue with the Turkish fleet, as soon as it arrived to operate against the Ka'ab, as their destruction was of the utmost import ance to the trade of Basrah, and could not be effected without British assist ance (Saldanha, p. 194). In January 1766, the Bombay Council of the East India Company decided on an expedition against the Ka'ab and six boats were despatched for the purpose- The Basrah agent was instructed to demand compensation and restitution from the Chief of the Ka'ab, in return for which the Com pany would engage not again to interfere in his disputes, provided that he did not interfere in their trade. It was anticipated that the treaty would be acceded to with eagerness by the Chief of the Ka'ab, in which case the Turks were not to be assisted by the Company's ships in their operations against him- But this was not to be expressly stated to them, and should the Ka'ab refuse satisfaction the Company's fleet would combine with the Turks (Saldanha, p. 195). In July 1766, it is recorded that the Ka'ab were looting villages above and below Basrah, and an attack on the town was feared. In April or May 1766, Captain Nesbitt, an officer in the Company's service, sent Lieutenant Dutton to make an armed reconnaissance of the ' river of Doraq.' He himself attempted negotiations with the Ka'ab Chief, and found him unreliable and faithless. In forwarding Captain Nesbitt's report on the 29th May the Resident at Basrah expressed the hope that he might be able to effect a reconciliation between the Turks and the Ka'ab, otherwise it B2 was useless ifor him to remain in Basrah. The lurks at this time seemed anxious to subdue the Ka'ab, but lacked ships and money The Company moreover obiected to assisting the Turks unless the latter paid for the expenses of the Company's fleet. This the Turks would not do, but it was not possible to withdraw the English fleet, as if it were to quit Basrah, all the inhabitants of the town would fly to Baghdad and the place would be ruined. An abortive attack was made during the summer of 1766 upon the Ka'ab Fort of Mansur (on Khor Buziyeh in old maps) and Lieutenant Nesbitt and a European gunner were killed. ' Captains Nesbitt and Brewer sent armed boats to reconnoitre the rivers whereby they discovered a considerable number of small boats were lying m a sma creek near a new erected fort named Mansur 1 which it was determined by them not only to destroy but also to attempt the fort, the former of which was effected, but failed in the latter for want of water and people to drag the guns being seven miles from the place of their landing when they began their retreat which was about midnight, the greatest loss was m the death of Lieutenant Nesbitt with an European gunner, four others only being wounded (Saldanha, p. 201).' At this time the Turks granted the Company's fleet a monthly subsidy of 1,000 Tomans a month, in consideration of the assistance they gave in sub duing the Ka'ab- During July 1766, Mahmud Kia, a Turkish General, arrived from Baghdad with 1,500 men and proceeded to Qubban in company with part of the Company's fleet. ' The Chub people immediately on their appearance deserted the fort with the greatest precipitation, the consequence of which has been a whole tribe of Chaub's principal Musquetiers having fled to Mahmud Kia with their families as well as to our ships. By those people we have learnt that the greatest disaffection reigns among his troops who would all desert him, but that he keeps their Chiefs continually within his sight and on the least sus picion commits the most horrid barbarities; in short they say there is nothing wanting but for the Turks to march into his country when it is thought the whole of his people would immediately desert him; therefore this measure has lately been very strongly represented by the Agent of the Company to the Turks.' Karim Khan was asked at this time not to give protection to the Ka'ab : he made no answer and appears in practice to have sheltered refugees (Saldanha, p. 205). Under date 23rd October 1766, the Basrah agent and Council wrote to the Council at Bombay that they had decided in regard to some small schooners— ' As they were so convenient for the Ka'ab's rivers to detain them with the rest of the fleet until we can know the final determination of the Turks in regard to Karim Khan, for although they have moved their Camp from Jalahai (Jarrahi) to the Haffar (Mohammerah) on account of the farmun lately sent to them by the Khan, yet there is reason to think they must renew the war against the Ka'ab and therefore have requested that we would continue the fleet on the present station and maintain blockade by sea as much as possible.' On the 23rd August, Shaikh Ghanim, son of Shaikh Salman, made an appointment to meet Captain Andrew Nesbitt in the neighbourhood of Khor Buziyeh. The meeting took place, but Ghanim behaved with impertinence and plainly contemplated treachery, which Captain Nesbitt prevented by attacking him first- Ghanim was dangerously wounded and several Shaikhs and others killed anfl wounded. The Company only lost one European and one sepoy killed, 5 Europeans and 3 Indians wounded. This affair happened about 5 in the evening. ' Towards ten o'clock, the flow having made, he (Nesbitt) endeavoured to board the ' Fort William' and ' Sally' but that being come within about Musqett shot the enemy set them both on fire but they (Captain Nesbitt and party) continued there till the flames burnt down to the water's edge.' 1 A district of this name (Mansiireh) exists some 8 miles north-east of'Buziyeh on the Jarrahi River {vide 1 mile = l inch map), but the same name occurs on the 1st edition of the Survey of India's (Colonel St. John's) map of Persia, 16 miles = 1 inch, opposite Qahr-an-Nakhuda on the mainland near rocks now known as Umm-ud- Dibab.Captain Nesbitt was reproved for having rashly and contrary to orders entered into negotiations with Shaikh Ghanim, but in view of the bravery shown in this afiair the plunder taken was distributed among the crew. On the 30th August, the Council report, Captain NesbTtt left the Turkish Camp, then at Qubban, having in his charge the Turkish galleys belonging to the Army : letters were despatched overland to Mahmud Kia, requesting him to march to the lower fort where the ships laid formerly, and advising him that Captain Brewer with his people were also disembarked and proceeding up river with artillery ammunition, etc., and a party of seamen. But before further reinforcements could arrive, a disastrous attack was made upon the redoubts of the Ka'ab (presumably at Qubban). Captain Brewer, Lieutenants Kass and Daly, Sergeant Grant and 18 men were killed, and 32 dangerously wounded : a field piece and 13 chests of ammunition were taken. In this engagement the Turks did not afford proper support to the Company's force, who bore the brunt of the fighting. The Ka'ab burnt several of the Turkish galleys and killed a number of their men. The Ka'ab and Turks both treated their prisoners cruelly and on this occasion a sepoy who had been captured by the Ka'ab was returned next day with his right hand, nose and ears cut off. Mahmud Kia was in consequence asked to treat prisoners with more lenity in future. Lieutenant Day, an officer in the Company's employ, tried to induce the Turks to assent to a scheme for escalading the redoubts, but the proposal came to nothing. On the 7th September, news was received that Karlm Khan had sent a letter to Muhammad Agha, the Turkish Commander at Qubban, requiring Turks and English alike to quit his country and not to make further attempts on the Ka'ab, as they were his subjects and under his protection. Muhammad Agha, fearing to bring on a war between Turkey and Persia, decided to comply with Karlm Khan's demands, whereupon the Company's agent in formed the Turks that they had nothing to do with the Persians and would not be referred to them for redress compensation. Mr. Skipp ' went through the Haffar in order to meet Mahmud Kia at Qubban ' and discussed the question with him. Mahmud Kia explained that Karlm Khan had insisted on the retirement of the Turks, as he had appointed Shaikh Salman, Governor of Doraq, but declared notwithstanding that he would compel the latter to make full reparation. It was reported from Bushire that the Ka'ab had actually petitioned Karlm Khan to extend his protection to them, and had sent him presents which had induced him to take the action referred to. The Basrah factors in reply asked their Bushire friends to tell Karim Khan, if necessary, that in fighting the Ka'ab they were only auxiliaries to the Turks and that they regarded the former as subjects to the latter. In January 1767, the Council at Bombay, writing to Peter Wrench, Esquire, ' The Agent for all the affairs of the British nation in the Gulf of Persia ' and ' the Council at Basrah,' advises direct dealing with the Ka'ab if possible, if not, approaching them through Karlm Khan. This was sound advice, as subsequently appeared, but the factors at Basrah were too dependent on the Turks to enable them to free themselves on the incubus of Turkish protection, and in reply to the Bombay Council they pointed out this fact, and decided to keep in with the Turks, remaining however, neutral as far as possible. In April 1767, the Basrah Council wrote to the Court of Directors giving a history of the Ka'ab as far as it is known to them. The Chaub is originally a subject of the Turks, and has for many years possessed a considerable territory within their dominions bordering upon the Persian Empire for which he ought and did for some years pay annually a large sum into the Treasury of this Pachaship. A few years after the death of Nadir Shah 1 and in the troubles that followed it, he also got possession of a territory in the Persian dominions, and by this means became a subject of both powers. The territory of Gaban and its districts is that which he possesses on the Turkish 2 and Daurack that in the Persian, by being in possession of such large terri- 1 Native history states that Shaikh Salman moved to Dauraq in 1747, the year of Nadir SLah's assassination. 2 See Sir H. Rawlinson's memorandum on the Turko-Persian frontier question, 1844. paragraph 4 (Appen dix 15 to this volume), which contains an extract from the ' Jihaa-Nama ' referring to Qubban. B 2tories and not paying the usual tribute to either power owing to the general decline of the Turks in these parts and the troubles that then reigned in the Persian Empire, he became in a manner independent of either and soon became rich by possessing the whole revenue. Judging, however, that he should in time be called on by both powers for an account of the arrears due to them, foresaw that a Marine force would be his greatest security and accordingly by degrees raised it to its present strength. Demands have been constantly made on him both by Turks and Persians for these arrears and he has constantly eluded the payment of them. In 1767, Sulaimun Pasha marched against them to Qubban whence the Chaub fled to his fort at Daurack which is so situated as to render the coming at it a work of great time and labour. By so doing he gained his ends, and by means of presents at Baghdad bought his peace with the Turks when his fort was near falling into the hands of 'Ali Agha, then General of the Turkish Army. The ' Swallow ' assisted 'Ali Pasha, on this occasion. In 1763, a renewed attack on the Ka'ab was made by 'Ali Pasha, 1 two British vessels assisting. They had several encounters with the jrallivats of the Chaub, but peace being restored our vessels returned thither (Basrah). In 1765, Karlm Khan attacked the Ka'aB, who fled to sea. Karlm Khan then destroyed the fort at Doraq. Karim Khan had asked for Turkish assist ance by sea and was so disgusted at their dilatoriness and the ultimate omission of the Turks to do anything that he returned and made no further overtures for combined operations against the Ka'ab. (This is perhaps ' the siege of Muhammad Kakhiah and Mister Zobaid el Farangi ' of Arab history.) During this period British ships were occasionally lent to the Turks. The Basrah Council wrote during 1767 to the Directors in London as follows :— It is with the greatest reluctance, we beg leave to assure your honours, that we find ourselves under the necessity of applying to Karim Khan for settling the tranquility of this Gulf: it is certainly in his power to do it. The Turks ate afraid to attempt the reduction of the Chaub without the Khan's permission, and this permission has not yet been granted. It appeared that if the Turks were given permission by Karim Khan they would do their best to reduce the Ka'ab. Three British ships were stationed off the Haffar for the blockade of that river, remaining small crafts were cruising between Basrah and the bar to protect the import and export trade of Basrah. In April 1767, Mr. Skipp was instructed to negotiate with Karim Khan. The board wanted Karim Khan to arrange a firm and lasting peace between the Ka'ab and the Turks and to obtain restitution for British losses (Rs- 1,00,000), also to compel the Ka'ab give up Qubban to the Turks and to reside entirely at Doraq or else to remain neutral and let the Turks endeavour to recover their own territories themselves and noted that ' our honour and interest preclude us from remaining neutral between the Turks and the Chaub.' In October 1767, news was received that Karim Khan had withdrawn his protection from the Ka'ab and had given liberty to the British to attack him (but unassisted by the Turks). The Turks were, however, intimidated by Karim Khan's threats and the Basrah Agent writes that it is no good expecting them to do anything. .We will endeavour all in our power to obtain the territory of Gaban for them or at least so far influence the Khan in their favour as' to obtain his neutralitv should they ever be surprised with spirit sufficient to obtain their own satisfac tion from the Chaub. Wretches as they are, however, sound policy, dictates the appearance of friendship with them, and as we are now on the best of terms so we will endeavour to continue. A ship was always on duty blocking the Haffar at this time. Mr. Skipp made an agreement in due course with the t: Vackeel of Per sia ' Karim Khan at Shiraz, whereby inter alia the latter made himself res- 1 Native history records an nnsucccssful attack by 'Ali Ajha in 1761 Rabi-ul Saoi A.D. 1763 .ponsible for the Ka'ab in the future and for the losses caused by them in past years. In March 1 &lt; 68, the London Court of Directors wrote to Basrah making some remarks on past events and directions for future policy in the Gulf. They said that lack of experience has caused non-success in every direction. The first mistake was in 1766 when their forces ioined a land expedition with the Turks against the Ka'ab. ^ llr * * * landed in a very bad wet place where the men had great dimculty to march, and which was too great a distance from the place to be attacked and consequently very difficult to bring up Artillery. The next step was attacking the fort before the Turks had joined, who certainly from their numbers should have begun the attack, and been assisted by our men ; this not being the case we were most shamefullv beat and lost many of our people. ' The letter goes on to say that we next put our faith in Kariim Khan, though he played us false. Our engagements to him are heavy, his promises to us are of no value. Passes have been issued at a price of R100 each to Arab boats by the Resident at Bushire to protect them from being plundered ; this is a mistaken policy, as it increases our engagements to a dangerous extent. Our policy in lending ships and men to the Turks, who are uniformly un successful in their expeditions, has damaged our ships and our trade ' and worst of all the honour and reputation of the nation.' The Basrah factors are ordered to avoid any alliance with the Arabs other than to be on friend ship, and to avoid joining in expeditions in which all the hard work will be left to us to do. ' c Always remember the promises or even writings of Persians or Arabs will be no longer validity than their interest coincides with them.' In October 1766^ the Basrah 'factors reported that the Ka'ab was build ing forts on either side of the river and the ' Turks are in no capacity to stop him.' In April 1768, Karim Khun ' diverted glory from the Ka'ab by power.' ['Arab history.) In April 1769, ' the Ka'ab ' was apparently sufficiently under the thumb of Karim Khan to obey his order to send a fleet from Doraq to Ganawah though in a half-hearted fashion. In this year (1769) a ' new Chaub ' appears on the scene, 1 no doubt a successor of Shaikh Salman. He is said to be heartily tired of his Persian connections, and it is said that Karim Khan has fleeced him more during the three years that he has been a Persian subject at Daurack than he paid the Turks in a dozen when he was a Turkish subject. It is plain from this that the Persians had by this time established an effective supremacy over the Ka'ab in default of the Turks. The Ka'ab was at this time in alliance with the Turks against the Munta- fik Arabs and his five ships of war lay off Minawi to protect Basrah against attack. It was reported on one occasion that several Turkish gallies with 9 gallivats of the Chaub arrived that night from the Haffar and gone up the river against a tribe of Arabs in alliance with the Muntafik, called the Kholt Arabs, who are situated on the Persian side of the river between this and Coornah. This is the first mention of the north bank of the Shatt-el-Arab as ' the Persian bank,' and may be quoted in support with the Persian claim to the whole north bank of the river up to Qurnah. In November 1769, the Bombay Board in a letter to London discuss the advantages of trade with Shushtar and mention the ' Shishter ' (Shushtar ?) Hawizeh-Basrah road as unsafe. 1 Native history records the death of Shaikh Salman in 1183 Hejra ('1768) : his successor was Ghanim, his son, who was replaced a year later on his death by Dawad-bin-Salman, and sis months later Barkat -bin-Uthman succeeded, Dawad having been killed.6 They add that the growing strength of the Ka'ab, Muntafik and Bani Lam Arabs constitute a growing menace to the peace of Basrah. In November 1771 the Basrah factors wrote :— ' Demands made in this country, unless supported by a respectable force, only serve to render the party who makes them contemptible. The present Chaub is as avaricious as the former.' He had lately blinded the eyes of ' Busboos,' the only surviving son of Shaikh Salman. 1 Karim Khan in this year appears as commencing piracy on his own account. From this time onward the records to which the writer has had access have very littla bearing upon the doings of the Ka'ab and their relations with the British and Persian Governments. In December 1773, when the Ka'ab were ordered by Karim Khan to send their ships to his assistance the Chief of that tribe retorted by 'scuttling his boats and showing them in that condi tion to Karim Khan's envoy. During this year (1773) plague in Basrah had been very severe and the total loss in Turkish Arabia was reckoned at 2 millions. It had disappeared by January 1774. In this month the Ka'ab were ordered by Karim Khan to assist him in his designs against the Turks : this they refused to do, and promised the Turks that they would remain neutral. Shortly after this promise an attack on the Turkish fleet by that of the Ka'ab, then lying at the Haffar, was only prevented by the presence of English ships of war. In February 1775, the Ka'ab sacked Basrah in revenge for the execution of an Arab by the Turkish authorities in Basrah. In April 1776, Basrah was surrendered to the Persians, and in the following month the Basrah Council write that :— Had we not been acquainted with the Persian character, we would have formed a most pleasing opinion of our future prospects under Persian rule. Early in 1779, the Persians retired from Basrah, which was re-occupied by the Turks (Karim Khan died in this year). In May 1798, Mr. Manesty, British Resident at Basrah, reported to the Governor-General of India that he was on intimate terms with desert and other Arab Shaikhg arni that British influence was firmly established in his district. At this point the Bombay Selections terminate; henceforward, until 1890, when a British Vice-Consulate was established at Mohammerah, the only records available in regard to the affairs of the Ka'ab and of 'Arabistan generally are those of the Bushire Residency. Those of the Basrah Consulate are very meagre and throw little light on 'Arabistan affairs, though these were dealt with by Her Majesty's representative there, under the orders of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, until 1890. 1 For a complete list of the Shaikhs of the Ka'ab, see annex to this chapter.CHAPTER If. The Ka'ab, the Shaikh of Mohammerah and Fallahiyeh ; Tribal Politics, Relations with Persian Government ; Internal and Political His tory of the Province from Early Times to Death of Haji Jabir. Basrah 1 was taken by Turkish troops in 1527 (A. H. 935) in the reign of Sultan Sulaiman-bin-Salim from the Arab Mughamis-al-Muntafik. Sultan Muhammad-bin-Murad whose reign commenced about 1591, reigned nine years. In his reign, Afrasiab Pasha, governed Basrah, having ejected the Turkish Pasha 'Ali. He reduced the territory of Qubban, 2 then held by a Turk, named Bakhtash Aqa, the scourge of his neighbours. He also conquered the Governor of Doraq and Saiyid Mubarak Khan, Prince of Hawizeh. The first named he besieged and obliged to surrender with the bare promise of his life. He reduced all the islands of the lower river, and after compelling the Prince of Hawizeh 3 to restore the territory on the left bank of the Euphrates dependent on Basrah, which he had usurped, he refused the ^future payment of a tribute formerly remitted to the Persians of that district. He died about 1601 (A. H. 1012) and was succeeded by his son 'Ali Pasha, who encouraged art and extended his dominions. Shah Abbas attacked Basrah sending an army under Imam Qull Khan, Governor of Farsistan (who also conquered the Ka'ab) ; but Basrah withstood the siege; on hearing of the death of Shah 'Abbas in 1625 (A. H. 1036) the army hastily retreated abandoning many guns and much property. On 1st Shawwal 1049 (1638) in a Treaty between Turkey and Persia for the delimitation of the frontier the independence of the Ka'ab was recognized {vide Hertslet's ' Persian Treaties,' 1891, p. 139, footnote). 'Ali Pasha died about 1646 and was succeeded by Husain Pasha, 4 whose violence and injustice estranged his subjects. His uncles, sons of Afrasiab, named Ahmed Aqa and Fathi Baig, rose against him and with the permis sion of the Porte attacked him with an army under Murtaza Pasha of Baghdad, who having taken Basrah, killed Ahmad Aqa and Fathi Baig. This so incensed the people that they, ejected Murtaza Pasha and sent for Husain, who was living at Behhahan. Husain was more oppressive than ever, but patronized literature and paid heavy bribes to the Sultan. In 1652, however, he captured Lahsa and killed many of its inhabitants. Muhammad Pasha, son of 'Ali Pasha, having complained to the Porte, a large army under Ibrahim Pasha, was despatched to Basrah and the Turks were henceforward strong in the land. In 1657, they reached Basrah, which was taken. Husain fled to Doraq and thence to Shiraz; failing to obtain assist ance from Sulaiman, he continued his journey to India with his son, 'All Baig, and eventually took service under the Rajah of Ujjain, in whose service he fought and died. His wives were brought thither from Doraq and bis descendants are said to be still living at Ujjain. No further details of Ka'ab are available until 1690, and the bulk v of our information from 1690 onward is obtained from a native history which was translated by Mr. McDouall, and which is summarized at the end of this chapter. Additional details kave been obtained from the works of Mignan, Stocqueler, Loftus, Hunt, Ainsworth and Layard. 5 These works show the Ka'ab to have been a strong Arab tribe with no predilections for either Persian or Turkish rule, fighting Persians or Turks 1 Prom Mignan's extract from the work of Fathullabibn Alwan-al-Ka'ab. 2 For a further account of Qubban see Rawlinson's memo, on Turko-Perslan frontier, 1844. 1 Hawizab was at this time capital of the Persian province of Khuzistan. 4 It is perhaps this man who gave the name ' A1 Husain Pasha,' according to native tradition, to the progenitors of the Muhaisin tribe {vide Gazetteer of Persia, J. G. Lorimer, C.I.E., p. 1253). 5 Efforts made to obtain a copy of the '^History of Modern Basrah ' by FathulIa-ibn-Alwan-al-Ka'ab, the sole member of that tribe who has distinguished himself in literary arts, have been unavailing, it was written about 1667—see Mignan, ' Travels in Chaldea,' 1827, p. 239 and p. 269 et seq.as occasion offered. They are said to have emigrated originally from the Arabian Coast of the Persian Gulf 1 and being buffalo herdmen, to have settled at Wasit on the Shat-el-Hai. Driven thence by the Muntafik they settled in the Delta of the Karun : to this cause their ancient feuds are ascribed. 2 rrom thence they extended their settlements up ' the Jarrahi, the ancient Hedyphon, pitching their tents round an artificial mound, the remains of some old city, upon which rose the modern town of Fallahiyeh.' The neighbouring tribe of Afshurs objected to this encroachment but the Ka'ab excused themselves by saying that the pastures of the Jarrahi were better than those of Qubban where they did not prosper. Soon afterwards a ditch was dug around the mound, upon which the Afshars again remonstrated. The Ka'ab replied that the ditch was dug to preserve their buffaloes, which were carried oif almost every night. The following year a stout mud wall rose within the ditch, and the Afshars finding that the Ka'ab were setting them at defiance, invited a neighbouring tribe to assist them in expelling the in truders. The Ka'ab on their side applied to the Wali of Hawizah to assist them in holding the footing they had acquired on the Jarrithi. ' We are Arabs,' they said, ' and consequently the Saiyid is a brother. It is better that we should be his subjects than those of the Afshars.' The Wali consented and marched against the Afshars who were thus driven alto gether out of Doraqistfin and took refuge at Lihrawi where they built a castle, which, according to Layard, still bears their name. 3 The Ka'ab Arabs, whose claims to the territory on which they pasture their buffaloes are much the same as that of any other tribe settled in Baby lonia or Chaldea, were not, however, allowed to remain long in peaceful pos session of their annexation. At the accession of Shah 'Abbas, Imam Quli Khan, Governor of Farsistan, headed an expedition against them and forced them not only to return part of their encroachments to the Afshars, but also compelled them to pay a certain tribute to the Shah of Persia, thus subjecting them to Persian rule. 4 This must have taken place about 1620. (Shah 'Abbas died 1625 = A. H. 1036.) Taking advantage, however, of the state of anarchy which succeeded the death of Nadir Shah (1740) the Ka'ab Arabs repossessed themselves of the whole of Doraqistan, and forcing the Arabs and sundry Turkoman tribes that pastured their flocks in the same territory to decamp, they made themselves masters of all the territory that intervened between the Euphrates, the Karun, and the Hindij an river. Their piratical exploits under the guidance of Shaikh Salman have been described in detail in Chapter I and need not be referred to here- He extended his dominions to Kurdilan on the Euphrates and to both banks of the Shatt- al-'Arab. He took Hindi j an, and destroyed the Dutch factory at Kharag. He was more than once attacked by both Persian and Turkish armies, but unsuccessfully. In 1763, Karim Khan broke the dam at Marid on the Karun, thus causing the waters of the Karun to desert (as it seems they had, for many years shown a tendency to do) the old bed past Qubban, a settlement said to have been founded shortly before the Safi dynasty by the successors of Husain Mehdi. Salman consequently admitted Persian sovereignty henceforward, and in return for assistance to the Persians at the siege of Basrah was granted the town of Hindi j an and its dependencies by Karim Khan in per petuity, according to Ainsworth, upon a payment of 1,000 tomans yearly to the Persian Government. As the attack of Karim Khan took place in 1703, attacks on Basrah (in both of which the Ka'ab helped the Persian), in 1742 1 Mr. J. G. Lorimer, C.I.E., in his Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf (Vol. 2) states that the original home of the Ka'ab was in Najd and that some of the tribe are still to be found there at a place (unidentified) calkd BViauraniyeh, also that the majority of the Ka'ab eventually established themselves in North Africa, but Nassar, the legendary progenitors o£ the Ka'ab of Southern 'Arablstan, made their way from IS'ajd to Doraq which they eventually occupied. 2 The following Quotation is from Ainsworth's ' Personal Narrative of the Euphrates Expedition,' 1888, Vol II, p. 297. 0 3 Nahr Afshar near Buziyeh is so called to this day in memory no doubt of this tribe. Lahrawi or Lihrawi is a tract in the Bakhtiari low country Ea^t of Batwand. 4 Native history (f. s.) records an attack on the Ka'ab by 30,000 Persians and Kurds under Muhammad Husain Qajar, which was repulsed in 1734, or thereabouts.9 and 1775, and as Salman died in 1767, before the second attack, Ainsworth's statement seems open to doubt. On Karlm Khan's death in 1779 the Ka'ab again asserted their independence, and indulged in frequent wars with the Muntafik and with the Turks. In 1827, Shaikh Ghaith concluded peace with the Pasha of Baghdad, to whom he sent envoys. On the accession of Muhammad Shah, however, the Persian Government again took steps to assert its position in 'Arabistan which seems then to have been known as Khuzistan. The Turks, too, renewed their attacks and in 1836-37 under 'Ali Riza Pasha actually captured Mohammerah, which, under the enlightened rule of Shaikh Thamir, had been made a free port to the detriment of the revenue of Basrah. Thamir had to fly but returned after a short interregnum. In 1840, Manucheh Khan Mu'tamid-ud-Dauleh forced Thamir to pay tribute : to this man, more than to any other, is due the deserted condition of 'Arabistan to-day. Of himself it may be truly said ' desertam fecit pacem appellavit.' An Armenian by birth, he was cruel and avaricious : his violence and faithlessness alienated all those with whom he came in contact, and to him, more than to any other Persian, must be ascribed the distrust which the Arabs still evince in so marked a degree in their dealings with the Persian Government. Hi^s harsh dealings with Muhammad Taqi Khan induced the latter to take refuge with Thamir, who gave him protection, at great personal risk and loss- A detailed account of this is given in Layard's ' Early Adventures,' Vol. II, p. 73. Muhammad Taqi Khan was induced by treachery to surrender himself : Shaikh Thamir was obliged to fly to Turkish territory, after some fighting, in which the Persians were assisted by the Wali of Hawizah, and by the Baniham Arabs, both of them hostile to the Ka'ab. At this time Shaikh Thamir was ruling over seven tribes, the Bu Nasir, Drls, Nassar, Muhaisin, Bawi, Bani Tammin and Haiyada- His annual tribute to the Persian Government was 3,400 tomans, equivalent to £1,700, and there were plenty of Persians in his entourage to look after the interests of the Central Government. He was succeeded by Paris, who, like Thamir, experienced many vicissi tudes of fortune at the hands of fhe Persians, by whom he was appointed as Chief of the Ka'ab. Jabir, hereditary 1 Shaikh of the Muhaisin, wlio lived at Diaji, was his deputy for Mohammerah. It was during his rule (1840—1858) that the Boundary Commission came to Mohammerah. The Turks claimed Mohammerah which, however, it was provided by the treaty of Erzeroum, 1848, should be considered as Persian territory. Taking their stand on this, the Turks claimed that the town and nothing but the town was Persian, the rest Turkish. It is unnecessary to go into the details of the dispute here, they are fully dealt with in the chapter on the Turko-Persian boundary. The declaration of war between Persia and Great Britain in 1856, which culminated in the fighting at Borasj an, the capture of Mohammerah and a subsequent expedition to Ahwaz, was caused by the insulting attitude adopted by the Shah to Her Majesty's Minister at Tehran, and the attacks on Hirat by the Persian Government. Attempts to settle amicably the ques tion at issue failed and war was declared by Proclamation of the Governor- General in Council on 1st November 1856. 2 Major-General Sir James Outram, K.C.B., was placed in command of the force : Bushire was reached on 30th January 1857 and engagements took place at Borasjan on the 5th February, where the Persian camp near the village was taken, and at Khushab on the night of the 7th. On the latter occasion the Persians attacked the column whilst on the move at night, but were repulsed without difficulty. The battle was resumed next morning with disastrous results for the Persians, who left more than 700 dead on the field : on our side only one officer and 18 men were killed. 1 His father had nominated another son to succeed him, hnt Jahir by virtue of his superior abilities vras accepted by common consent as the head of the tribe on bis father's death. 2 A full and lucid account of the causes leading to the declaration of war, and of the war itself, is contained in Captain Hunt's ' Persian Campaign,' 1856. The official history is contained in ' British Expeditions to PersiaI.E., 1884. C10 The troops re-embarked and the fleet arrived at the mouth of the Shatt-al- 'Arab on the 8th March. The village of Ma'amir (Qasbat-al-Nassar) was occupied by the enemy but no acts of hostility were committed on either side. On the 23rd March the fleet moved up the river to a point 3 miles below the mouth of the Karun. 1 The troops were now transhipped, together with the guns and horses, into steamers and vessels of lighter draught, the enemy, making no attempt to interfere. At nightfall on the 25th some engineer officers, after a reconnaissance in a small canoe of the enemy's forts, which they approached to within 300 yards, established a mortar battery on a raft behind the low swampy island which lies in midstream opposite Mohammeralf, and was to be known henceforward by Arabs, from this circumstance, as Umm-ar-Rassas—' Mother of lead ' or bullets.' At daybreak on the 26th March the mortars from this raft opened fire with deadly effect. At the first shot, the fleet, consisting of 7 vessels, of which two were sloops, weighed anchor and steamed up river and poured shell on the enemy's batteries which were situated one on each side of the mouth of the Karun : the shell-fire, it is recorded, felled many date trees, and many old trees in the Jabiriyeeh lands can still be seen with the gashes in them caused by round shot, which are frequently found in the gardens. The ships passed unhurt within one hundred yards of the battery and the trans port ships, whose decks were crowded with men, similarly passed unscathed. The Persians stood to their guns for about 3 hours, after which their fire slackened. Troops were then landed just beyond the western battery {i.e., above the Customs, at Hauz-ul-Malakeh) and were only feebly opposed. The Persian Army fled precipitately, leaving their tents standing whilst arms and ammunition, accoutrements and food lay about in profusion. Not less than 300 men had been killed on the Persian side, not including those killed by the Arabs who butchered all Persians they came across: The loot of the Persian camp is still a popular theme amongst the greybeards of Moham- merah. The Persian General was the Governor-General of 'Arabistan, Ihtisham- ud-Dauleh, uncle of the King : his troops seem to have been all Persians : the Arabs being ready, as usual, to side with the conquerors. On the 29th March 2 steamers each towing a second vessel left Moham- merah for Ahwaz. Sab'ah was reached the following afternoon, and the next evening Ismailiyeh was reached. 'Amaireh was reached next evening and on the 1st April Ahwaz was reached. The enemy were found in force on the right bank, only a small force of 500 men being in the town as a guard for the stores, to capture which was the object of the expedition. Troops^wtere landed and the town was captured without resistance, the Shaikh having surrendered himself, and the Persian garrison having fled as also did the main body. On the 6th April the expedition returned to Moham- merah. Peace with Persia had been concluded at Paris on the 4th March previously. On the 15th May the expedition left Mohammerah for India, the town haying been handed over on the previous day to Shaikh Jabir's tribe of Arabs (the Muhaisin). It might have been thought that the signal exhibition of cowardice on the part of I nnce Ihtisham-ud-Dauleh would not have been without its effect on the Arabs, who had had such an excellent opportunity of gauging the true value ot the Persian Army for military purposes- But it was not so. Shaikh 1 ans was sent for by the Prince whose summons he meekly obeyed : he was put m chains and sent to Tehran, where he remained for some years. In his place Haji Jabir was installed as Chief of Fallahiyeh and Mohammerah, and lett Diaji to live at Mohammerah, {i.e., Kut Paris or Kut-i-Shaikh on the opposite bank). Shortly afterwards he sent his son Muhammad to act as JJeputy Governor at Fallahiyeh, a step which was not actively resented. But J abir, like Fans, was still completely subservient to the Persians of whose ine^ dency^ e had had such signal proof. Sent for by the Prince he repaired to inirujird, then a long and dangerous journey: In his absence the Ka'ab 1 The place is called Harteh al Bunaji in native \ustory.attacked his son who was only able to hold his own with the help of Persian soldiers from Ahwaz, for whose assistance he paid heavily. Haji Jabir how ever was permitted to return and his timely arrival turned the scale. Fal- lahiyeh was taken and the prestige of the Ka'ab Shaikhs permanently impaired. A change of Governors, however, deprived Jabir for the moment of the fruits of his enterprise and determination- Prince Ihtisham-ud-Dauleh was recalled and succeeded by Zia-ul-Mulk, who brought back Paris from Tehran. The latter's cousin Lutfullah raised the tribes against Jabir and a battle royal ensued between the Muhaisin and the Ka'ab at Manikh 2 miles above Mohammerah at the junction of the Karun and Bahmanshir. The Muhaisin were defeated. Jabir fled to Diaji which was then as now Turkish territory and the Dris tribe, which had supported the Muhaisin, dispersed. Shaikh Paris thereupon came to Mohammerah supported by Persian soldiers and three guns : he stayed for a few days, and appointed his brother Hashim to be Governor of Mohammerah. Zia-ul-Mulk arrived at Mohammerah in 1860 and seems to have deter mined to break Haji Jabir's power by treachery. He treated him well at first, made Muhammad, Jabir's son, Governor of Mohammerah, and promised Haji Jabir the Governorship of Pallahiyeh, telling Muhammad to write to his father to come to Muran to meet Zia-ul-Mulk who intended to attack Pallahiyeh forthwith. Haji Jabir rode off to Muran where he was received with honour. The next night a Captain of the Army of whom Jabir had complained and who had been punished and degraded by Zia-ul-Mulk in consequence 1 was sent to execute the Governor's orders on his quondam accuser. Jabir was seized, dragged into his tent, and locked up, and shortly afterwards sent to Shushtar. His son was arrested and handed over to Paris. In 1862 Zia-ul-Mulk was recalled and succeeded by Parhad Mlrza, under whom Jabir found favour. He was at once liberated and sent with Persian soldiery and guns to Mohammerah as Governor. On his arrival, under what circumstances is not clear, Sultan-bin-Thamir and Hashim bin Ghaith of the Ka'ab were killed- Haji Jabir was created Nusrat-ul-Mulk in 1862; he resided at Moham merah and was Governor of that district without interruption henceforward. In 1868 Paris went blind and was succeeded by his son Muhammad. The replacement of Parhad Mirza by Hamzah Mirza (Hishmat-ud- Dauleh) in 1869 was the occasion for further changes in the Government of Pallahiyeh, but Jabir himself was left in peace. The result of these changes was to weaken the family of the Ka'ab Shaikhs, of whom several perished in internecine conflicts with the result that in 1880 Hamzah Mirza was able to make Jabir Governor of Pallahiyeh, Jarrahi, Deh Mulla, etc.,—the first time that such an appointment had been made by the Persian Government. This important change had scarcely been effected, however, when a change of Governors brought back Ihtisham-es-Saltaneh as Governor of 'Arabistan under the order of Zill-es-Sultan, the titular Governor. He was preceded by Ja'far Quli Khan 2 as Agent of the Zill-es-Sultan, who re placed Haji Jabir at Pallahiyeh by Ja'far bin Muhammad bin Paris. A few months later, however, Ja'far auli Khan was recalled and his place taken hy Ihtisham-es-Saltaneh, who true to his old policy reversed that of his prede cessor and replaced Ja'far by his uncle Rahman-bin-Tsa bin Ghaith at Pallahiyeh. He would undoubtedly have taken further steps to undermine Jabir's position but the latter died a few months later. A dispute at once arose regarding the succession : the Persian Govern ment however made no attempt to subvert the established custom of the place. To quote a contemporary native record—'A dispute arose between Haji Jabir's sons Muhammad and Miz'al as to Mohammerah, Muhaisin, and the property. The Muhaisin and Dris and those of the Shatt-al-'Arab took the 1 The Governor ' had taken his boots off and put him in the sun ' (native history), 2 It is not clear who this man was—the father of Husain Quli Khan Ilkhani, perhaps, or the son of Muhammad Taqi Khan Chahar Lang. c 212 side of Miz'al as his father had appointed him his heir. The news reached Zill-es-Sultan who sent a robe of honour to Miz'al, for in the time of his father Haji Jabir the paper of Government was in the name of Miz'al, so Muham mad was out of it.' This brief statement explains clearly the system by which the Shaikh of Mohammerah was appointed—the choice of the father confirmed by popular opinion or by trial of strength and regularised by the sanction of the Persian Government. It is noteworthy that Muhammad although the elder son and a good fighting man, seems to have accepted the verdict of the Zill-es-Sultan as conclusive.14 Date of accession. Name.

On the death of Haji Jabir, after a long illness, Shaikh Miz'al, his second son, succeeded him, but not without considerable difficulty. Though Haji Jabir had nominated Miz'al to succeed him, his elder son, Muhammad, was the more popular, and was generally believed to be more able, and for some time, until the farman of the Persian Government arrived for Miz'al, Muhammad carried on the government, though he took pains to conciliate his younger brother, who nevertheless felt the situation acutely. Miz'al had for some years previous to his accession maintained close relations with the British Consul and Assistant Political Agent at Basrah and at one time was in almost constant attendance on him- The strenuous opposition to British commercial enterprise which he subsequently organised was therefore unexpected. Until the opening of the Karun in 1889 this hostility did not show itself in a marked form, but the establishment by Messrs. Lynch Brothers of agen cies at Ahwaz and Shushtar, and the competition of the ' Malamir ' with his own steamer on the Karun aroused his apprehensions. It was not British aggression that he feared so much as Persian ambitions, and his fears were confirmed by the attitude of the British Vice-Consul, who was appointed in 1891 and who was obliged to appeal to the Persian Governor and Karguzar to put pressure on Shaikh Miz'al in the interests of British trade on the Karun. In suppressing piracy he was not less active than his successor, and seisms to have done his best to co-operate with the Turks, with the usual result. He maintained order amongst the tribes and showed no inclination to be sub servient to the Turks, though there is little doubt Haji Jabir had registered Miz'al's name as a Turkish subject in order to enable him to hold land in Turkey without interference. He was at first not unpopular with his tribes but his avarice caused his downfall. As soon as he felt his power established, he raised taxation and asserted a right, which Haji Jabir had never claimed, to personal ownership of lands in Mohammerah and dependencies. He was strong enough to make good this claim by giving possession of date groves to the highest bidder, regardless of the claims of the hereditary occupants. But this policy brought its own reward : by 1895 his unpopularity was extreme and most of the heads of tribes had signed documents pledging themselves to support his younger brother Khaz'al, should the turn of the wheel of fortune bring him to the top. Khaz'al who had made no secret of his conviction that his political salvation lay in assisting and not opposing the British informed Her Majesty's Vice-Consul of this, and assured him that should he become Shaikh he would be friendly to the British even though political exigencies forbade him to show his feelings. Such was the course which Shaikh Khaz'al laid down for himself in 1895 and which he has followed pertinaciously. In 1897, as is related in the next chapter. Shaikh Miz'al was assassin ated; he had kept English, Turks and Persians alike at arm's length, and had tried to stand alone, without even endearing himself to his tribes, from whom he derived his authority. His removal was therefore inevitable and it was a matter of surprise that it was so long delayed.18 CHAPTER IV. 1897-1910. Shaikh Khaz'al's Rule. The assassination of Miz'al took place on June 2nd, 1897, when he was disembarking from his boat at Failiyeh: his nephew 'Abdul Jaiil was shot simultaneously. The actual assassins were three negroes, but a large force of negroes and Arabs under Salman bin Mansur, the Shaikh's cousin, was at hand to give support if necessary. The act was countenanced, if it was not instigated, by Khaz'al, the youngest son of Haji Jabir, Miz'al's brother. Haji Muhammad 'Ali Rais-ut-Tujjar is generally supposed to have been likewise privy to the deed- Miz'al had been popular in the earlier stages of his career but his stinginess and avarice combined to make him more and more unpopu lar, and his death was welcomed by all classes. He left no issue. Shaikh Khaz'al at once assumed the direction of affairs; no disturbances occurred, though the local population carried arms for several days after wards mindful of the disturbances that had followed Haii Jabir's death in 1881. J The strong policy of the Shaikhs of the Muhaisin, which Haji Jabir had initiated, was in no way weakened by the change of head in respect of the adjoining districts. It was rather intensified, and before long a tendency became apparent to an expansion of the Shaikh's influence beyond its tradi tional limits. 1 The subjugation of the Ka'ab tribe, which had been one of the mam objects of Miz'al's rule, was finally effected before long, and from the first the Shaikh exercised effective control in Mohammerah, and the nomina tion of the Governor at Fallahiyeh was practically in his hands. The Persian Government were in no hurry to recognize Khaz'al as Miz'al's successor and did not continue to him the title of Mu'izz-es-Saltanah, 2 which his brother had enjoyed, until April 1898. The Shaikh soon found the traditional hostility of the Governor of 'Arabistan to the Shaikh of Mohammerah was in no way diminished. He was not a little apprehensive at this time that the Sardar Akram, Governor of 'Arabistan, might put up his nephew 'Abud as a rival. Abud himself was unlikely to make such a claim of his own accord, but he might be used by the Persians for their own purpose, as had been done in Shaikh Miz'al's time, when Muhammad, his brother, was appointed as Gover nor vice^ Miz'al until the latter paid heavily for the cancellation of the orders. The Ka'ab were ready, as always, to support any pretender who had a chance of success and under whose leadership they might break the power of the house of Bu Kasib. The Sardar Akram intended to force 'Abdullah on the Ka'ab as the Governor of Fallahiyeh, against their will and contrary to Shaikh Khaz'al's advice. The latter had already paid 15,000 Tomans fishkash to the Sardar Akram as a condition of the latter s assistance in obtaining a farman for him as Miz al s successor. In the meanwhile the Sardar Akram wired to Tehran itat he had interviewed the Arabs at Nasiri (where 'Abud was) and that if the bhaikh did not comply with his demands (in regard to the Governorship of Fallahiyeh) he could do to the Shaikh what his (the Sardar's) father had done to Shaikh Nasir m Bushire in 1845, i.e., deport him and replace him bv a Persian Governor. r J The Shaikh on his part wired to the Nizam-es-Saltaneh whose nominee isardar Akram was, protesting against thej latter's intrigues: the Nizam wired to the Sardar to cease interference in the Arab districts and devote his energies to the pacification of Shushtar and Dizful which towns were then 1 The ' traditional limits ' are expressed in the Arab savins 1 that ' wkon +1^ -n- ■ A , Haji Jabir stopped at Salmanah : when the Ka'ab were strong he was afraid to eo to WC i? . str0n ^ the battle at the latter place, in which tbe Muhaisin were defeated.^ 8 ** ^ 0 g0 &lt;0 ^ lini ^ an allusion to - Jn August 1 902 he was created Sardar Arfa' and the title of NusratMil-Mnll- f j ™ h 15 eldest son. The titles ef Ami.- Toman and Amin NnjSn were conferred on ^'n^sTety™V mS '19 as now disturbed. Nevertheless the Governor, actuated partly by spite and partly by cupidity, invoked the aid of the Bakhtiari to force 'Abdullah on the Ka'ab. Shaikh Khaz'al wired to Tehran to Haji Rais-ut-Tujjar, who had gone there as his emissary to arrange for his recognition as Shaikh, that he renounced all responsibility for outside districts, including Fallahiyeh, and added that he would leave the Ka'ab to take their own line with the Sardar Akram, should the latter persist in his present attitude. The Sadr 'Azam telegraphed to the Sardar Akram not to change the Governors of Fallahiyeh and Jarrahi, but on the same day that he received this order the Sardar defiantly invested 'Abdullah with the Governorship of Fallahiyeh and Mir Mirai with that of Jarrahi. 1 Both men proceeded to Ramuz with Nasir Khan Bakhtiari, who was to support them. The Shaikh's nominees for the Governorship of these provinces. Shaikh Jabir and Mir Fadhail respectivelv, now assembled their forces with Khaz'al's concurrence. The Sardar Akram meanwhile made renewed attempts to induce the Bakhtiari Khans to guaran tee the revenue of Fallahiyeh and put 'Abdullali in, but they declined to do so unless the Jarrahi was granted to them also, and even then they could not make themselves responsible. The Shaikh on the other hand received promises of assistance from Mihr 'All Khan Sagwand, who wrote to him that he understood Jalal-ud- Dauleh to have been appointed to 'Arabistan and that the Sardar Akram's antics might be ignored. The Sardar Akram again telegraphed to Tehran, enlarging on his pre vious telegram, and saying that if the Shaikh had his way, in a few years 'Arabistan would be in the hands of the English. The Turks, he said, had put in their own men at 'Amarah and Kuwait with the loss of only a few lives, why should not the Persian Government do likewise at Mohammerah? He complained that all the local officials favoured the Shaikh, who, at this period, was very popular with all classes, who welcomed his mild regime after the tyrannical methods of Miz'al. It was a critical time for the Shaikh, and he probably owes the fact that the Persian Government did not support the Sardar Akram in his de signs less to his own strength than to the fortunate circumstance that the Nizam-es-Saltaneh (the Sardar Akram's master) owned the Jarrahi district in partnership with Mushir-ud-Dauleh who was then in power at Tehran. Veiled reference to this fact is made in the telegram from the Sardar Akram quoted below. If the Shaikh, who as Miz'al's successor farmed the Jarrahi and the lands west of the Karun owned by the Nizam, was to refuse to be res ponsible for those districts, all chance of recovering rent would vanish. This apprehension probably influenced the Nizam and Mushir-ud-Dauleh more than any abstract conceptions of sound policy, and the Sardar Akram received no support from his superior. In the middle of April 1898, the opposing parties came to blows, and a son of Mir Fadhail was killed. The Nizam-es- Saltaneh, on hearing that hostilities had commenced, telegraphed to the Sardar Akram that as he had not complied with his orders, he would be left to get out of his troubles as best he could- The Sardar Akram eventually withdrew his forces, and early in 1899 was replaced by Prince 'Ain-ud-Dauleh. The mischief which he had worked with the Bawi tribe occupying the central part of the 'Arabistan plain between the Jarrahi and the Karun was rectified by an expedition which the Shaikh conducted against them in the autumn of 1898, which procured their submission without much difficulty. Sir H. M. Durand visited Ahwaz during this year coming via Ispahan and returning to Tehran via Burujird. He did not meet the Shaikh but sent him the Royal Victoria Medal, which the Shaikh accepted, after asking permission from Tehran. 2 1 He sent the following wive to the Sadr 'Azam : ' If my remaining depends on Khaz'al's pleasure no delay is necessary and I beg that orders for a change of Government be issued. The good of the State and my acceptance of Khaz'al is dependent on this, that Khaz'al pays the balance of the Fallahiyeh taxes and puts in 'Abdullah as Governor there. He wants to insist on Ja'far. If what he wishes is done 'Arabistan may be given up, and in two years' time you will see the province like Bahrain, separated from Persia and under a separate Government. I have made no mistake and have not acted unadvisedly. I will not sell my honour for the money of the Governorship of 'Arabistan. If you think to preserve your estates here by depending on Khaz'al you are writing on water. Do as you like.' 2 This was not done, under advice from Hia Majesty's Minister, in the case of the K.C.I. E. conferred on the Shaikh in 1910. D 220 In 1900 the negotiations between the Shaikh and the Persian Govern ment for the assumption of the control of the Customs by the latter com menced. They are dealt with in detail in Chapter IV and need not be refer red to further here. The annual net receipts of the 'Arabistan Customs were at this time estimated at £3,000 per annum. 1900 was an uneventful year 'Ain-ud-Dauleh proceeded to Tehran at the end of the year, on appointment as Governor of the capital. He was succeeded by Prince Salar-ud-Dauleh as Governor-General of 'Arabistan and Luristan, under whom the forces of disorder in Shushtar and Dizful had full play. He did not appear in 'Arabistan during 1901, which was a year of scarcity of crops. [It is a very general belief amongst Arabs that since the opening of the Karun to international traffic such years have been increasingly frequent. Probably the wholesale destruction of the brushwood which once lined the banks of the rivers is the cause of the progressive desiccation of the province, if such is really taking place.] . The same arrangements for the governance of 'Arabistan held good during 1902 and 1903, and the province remained in a disturbed state. In beptember 1902 the ' Shushan ' was attacked at Shalili and some damage done. A barge of the Mu'in's was also looted at Wais. In Luristan, too, unrest prevailed and the Farhan regiment was attacked whilst on the march irom Khurramabad to Dizful. After some resistance in which the regulars are said to have lost 80 men, the remainder surrendered. The Lurs took the rifles ammunition, and other stores and also looted the caravan which was marching with the troops said to be of the value of 40,000 Tomans. The Bani Turuf, encouraged by the evidence of unrestrained lawlessness on every side, also gave trouble and the Shaikh was obliged to prepare an expedition to deal with them. Before operations could be commenced how- ever, they made their submission. The year 1904 was not less disturbed than its predecessor. Maior n 0 + U u Lieutenant Lonmer were attacked and seriously wounded in c ober near Khurramabad and nothing effective was done by the Persian Government to punish the guilty tribe until July 1905, when some Lurs alleged to nave taken part m the attack were captured. The ' Shushan ' was repeatedly attacked and her running had to be sus- pended several times. &amp; o o For a short period previous to the return of 'Azim-es-Saltaneh as Gover- nor, during which the policing of the river was entrusted to Shaikh Khaz'al tne work was most satisfactorily carried out, but immediately the arran^e- ments were taken out of his hands, matters reverted to their former insecure state. Several epidemics of cholera visited Ahwaz, Shushtar, Dizful and Mohammerah from June to October of this year. ih v ^ 190 r ^ aS llk ?wise disturbed; some of the minor tribes under the Shaikhs jurisdiction indulged m the rare, and of recent years almost forgotten, luxury of a tribal fight.

'Ali Minaishid and Zair 'Ali were entrusted with the charge of tribal affairs, 1 and Sharhan given as a hostage to the Shaikh. It was given out that the Bani Turuf had paid up 40,000 Tomans out of the 80,000 due from them, and that Ghadhban of the Bam Lfclm had gone security for the remainder, although it is apparent that should events necessitate it, there was no means of forcing Ghadhban to make good his undertaking. In March 1906 Haji Sabhan reappeared from his retirement and treacherously fell on the handful of Persian soldiers left in Hawizah of whom 3 were killed and 8 wounded. Hanzal, Khaz'al's nephew, and Deputy Gover nor of Nasiri was deputed to the command of a levy of the Bawiyeh which had already been despatched by the Sardar Arfa'. A skirmish took place, and at the beginning of April Hanzal fought a small action (in which the total casualties amounted to about 20) which resulted in the discomfiture and flight of Sabhan. During this year, too, a long standing dispute reached a crisis between the Shaikh and the Bakhtiari in regard to the Raghaiweh land on the Ahwaz- Ispahan road on the border between Bakhtiari and Arab territory. Raghai weh was originally accounted the property of the Shaikh, but his represent ative Mullah Thani in whose charge it was seems to have neglected it. The Bakhtiaris assumed the grazing rights of the locality and gradually a small settlement came into existence. Refugees from the Shaikh's jurisdiction found it a convenient place of sanctuary and demands for their surrender were consistently refused by the Khans. In April 1905, Haji Rais almost succeeded in obtaining the consent of the Samsam-es-Saltaneh and his party for the lease of the land to the Shaikh, but at the last moment died off. In July the matter was again brought into prominence by the flight of a rebel Shaikh and his adherents into Raghaiweh. This Shaikh, named Masikh, alleged oppression on the part of Zair Farhan of Wais who was also respon sible for most of the previous desertions. Permission was finally received from Tehran for the repatriation of the refugees of Raghaiweh by force and in November Zair Farhan of Wais and the Zargham-ul-Mamalik, the Salar-i- Mu'azzam's Military Commander, left together to put this into practice. Instead however of inducing the refugee Arabs to return this estimable couple contenting themselves with permitted the abuse of their womankind by their followers. It is stated that in certain cases they cut the breasts off Arab women. The Shaikh was greatly incensed and Farhan was arrested and sent to Fallahiyeh. The question was finally settled by the Shaikh leaving the disputed land and it may be hoped that the question has thus been finally settled. The crops both in 1905 and 1906 w T ere scanty. The relations of the Salar-i-Mu'azzam, who was given the title of Sardar Mukarram during 1905, 2 with the Shaikh of Mohammerah were cordial on the whole, and at no time was there any important conflict of opinion on oil interests between them. On his arrival in 'Arabistan with a small force he quickly asserted for himself (thanks to the consistent support of the Shaikh) a power and authority which have not been known in any ruler of the Pro vince since Sulaiman Khan. In Shushtar he began with the destruction of Kazim Khan Kalantar, a man who had been the cause of many disturbances and a thorn in the side of the late Governor 'Azim-es-Saltaneh. He was beaten to death, and his pro perty seized. The religious house of Shaikh Muhammad 'Ali in Shushtar also attracted his ill-will, and on the death of the old man himself his sons had -to leave the town : in the spring of 1906 a reconciliation was effected. The rival house of Saiyid 'Abdul Samad received favourable treatment at his hands. Captain Lorimer, who as Consul at Ahwaz had good opportunities of judging, described the Sardar Mukarram as ' a man of force and ability, but 1 After the Bani Turuf expedition of 1908 these two men were exiled. 2 He received the title of Nizam-es-Saltaneh in 1908 soon after the death of his father who bore this title.22 avaricious more than cruel, and entirely selfish. He seems incapable of any generous sentiments and one seeks in vain in his acts for any trace of compas sion or mercy- It is only fortunate that, for the furtherance of his own designs, he has found it convenient to exercise his redoubtable powers towards introducing peace and security into the country.' 1 In pursuance of the latter aim he exacted a demonstration of subjection from Tarhan Assad of the Ka'ab Dubais, Haidar of the Kathir, and several other Chiefs. Towards British interests the Sardar Mukarram did not show himself partial, although they benefited indirectly by the re-establishment of order. He however always masked his practical unfriendliness by clouds of hypocri tical verbiage. In April 1907, he was made Governor of Luristan and Arabistan com bined and left the following month. His relations with the Shaikh had re mained cordial to the last and the latter was in consequence induced to accept responsibility for Northern 'Arabistan in his friend's absence. The depar ture of the Sardar Mukarram was hailed with truculent joy by the people of Shushtar and Dizful, and the Shaikh and his subordinates, thanks to their association with him, were by no means acceptable to the townspeople as Governors. Khuda Karam Khan Chahar Lang and Saif-un-Nizam were therefore put in by the Shaikh as his deputies at Shushtar and Dizful res pectively. The arrangement was not however particularly successful. The Shaikh made no effort forcibly to establish his authority, excusing himself on the grounds that if he dealt with the Shushtaris according to their deserts he would gain nothing and would certainly be taken to task by the authorities in Tehran. The charge of Northern 'Arabistan remained in the Shaikh's hands more by default than by any definite arrangement until November 1908 when Haji Saif-ud-Dauleh, brother of Ain-ud-Dauleh, and grandfather of the wife of Shaikh Khaz'al, 2 arrived from Tehran. 'Arabistan on the whole remained quiet, although the perennial enmity between Haidar of the Kath!r Arabs and Farhan Assad' of the Bait Sa'ad culminated in hostilities, in which the former, assisted by the Sagwand, managed to establish his superiority. It is probable that he had the support, or at least the assent, of Shaikh Khaz'al who had previously forbidden him to resort to arms to avenge the constant out rages and robberies which were perpetrated on his followers by the raiding parties of Farhan. The last named chief is a standing menace to the peace of 'Arabistan and it is greatly to be regretted that neither the Governor of Shushtar under whom he nominally is, nor the Shaikh of Mohmmerah who exercises practical control over him, has seen fit to take decisive measures to put an end to his maleficent activities. He has caused the murder of nearly all the principal men of the once powerful Anafijeh tribe and did the latter not enjoy the powerful protection of Shaikh Khaz'al, there is little doubt that they would have been practically exterminated. Farhan was forced to flee and sought refuge at Gotwand. Thence he was induced to come and see Shaikh Khaz'al, and was allotted land near Wais, but he made off to Gotwand again and later re-established himself in Deh Nau again. Again forced to flee he joined the Bani Turuf, whom he incited to rebel against the Shaikh of Mohammerah. Eventually on the collapse of Bani Turuf rebellion he again came in to Shaikh Khaz'al who with a leniency which undoubtedly amounted to weakness permitted him to take up his abode at Kut Nahr Hashim with Saiyid Na'ameh. 3 He returned however to his tribe in 1909 and spent 1910 intriguing with the Bakhtiari against the Shaikh and indulging in unprovoked hostilities with the Anafijeh and Saiyid Na'ameh. The rebellion with the Bani Turuf mentioned above commenced in June, when the Shaikh was obliged to send a small force to deal with his local representative Assad Khan. This individual fled to the Bani Turuf and the expedition was more or less abortive. As usual the Shaikh endeavoured to avoid hostilities and attempt to settle the matter peaceably by the arts of - in F ' sWly borc ^ ' Ms ^^ 3 This farce was reenaoted in 1911.diplomacy. He is essentially a man of peace and prefers to exhaust every means of persuasion before having recourse to arms. Circumstances were however too strong for him : the Bani Turuf imbroglio soon developed and the notorious Haji Sabhan returned to Hawizeh to put himself at the head of the forces of disaffection. After several abortive efforts towards a peaceful settlement, the Shaikh was obliged to collect a force of from 15,000 to 20,000 men a portion of which advanced on the Bani Turuf in the middle of Novem ber 1908. After some skirmishing a split in the enemy's ranks, which may be counted on so confidently in any emergency in this country, made a settlement easy. 'Ali Minaishid and Zair 'Ali were exiled and replaced by Salih Mutailij and 'Asl : Haji Sabhan was taken to Failiyeh as a hostage where he remained during 1910. Ghadhban of the Bani Lam as usual supported the Shaikh without taking any active part in the affair. Shaikh Mubarak of Kuwait assisted the Shaikh by the loan of a number of rifles and a large quantity of ammuni tion. The meeting of the Shaikh of Mohammerah in April 1908 with certain of the Bakhtiari Khans, namely, Haji Khusrau Khan, Ghutam Husain Khan and Nasir Khan, deserve special mention. It resulted in an agreement signed by Najaf Quli, Samsam-es-Saltaneh, as well as by the above mentioned Khans, the Shaikh and his son Shaikh Chasib Khan, Nasrat-ul-Mulk, whereby the two parties agreed to be friends, to prevent disputes, and to assist each other in all matters. The agreement is reproduced as Appendix 13 to this report. It has remained a dead letter, however, and its only value lies in its exposition of the points of possible conflict between the Shaikh and the Khans and of the proper means to prevent such a conflict. The year 1909 was comparatively uneventful. Haji Saif-ud-Dauleh left the province in May 1909 without troubling to wait for the permission of Government. He lived with the Shaikh for the whole period of his sojourn in 'Arabistan, never once having gone to Shushtar or Dizful, which towns, perhaps in consequence, were fairly quiet, though the road between them was unsafe for the greater part of the year. Aqa Rahim, a minor Bakhtiari notable, was occasionally Governor of Dizful during the year and did his best to stir up trouble amongst the Arabs and Hawizah and Northern 'Arabistan against the Shaikh, but his efforts were not attended with success. Shaikh Khaz'al found it necessary in June 1909 to replace Hanzal, bis nephew, by his eldest son Chasib, Nasrat-ul-Mulk, in the Deputy-Governorship of Nasiri. Hanzal was accused of conspiring to murder the Shaikh, but there was a good deal of doubt as to the genuineness of the charge, which probably affected the Shaikh less than a desire to instal his son at Nasiri. Haji Fakhr-ul-Mulk who arrived in Shushtar in October 1909 as Gover nor of 'Arabistan at first adopted a somewhat aggressive attitude to the Shaikh, but this ceased on personal acquaintance and during 1910 no serious difference of opinion arose between them : it was a year of peace as far as Southern 'Arabistan was concerned, although Shushtar and Dizful were in their usual state of chronic anarchy which necessitated the Shaikh collecting an army at Ahwaz in July for the purpose of restoring order at Shushtar. On the arrival of the army at Band-i-Qir, however, the usual proposals for a compromise were made, and accepted by the Shaikh, who withdraw the army forthwith. The presence of the force at Nasiri under arms also served to encourage the belief in the mind of Saulat-ud-Dauleh that the Shaikh was ready to assist him in his difficulties with the Bakhtiari and the Central Government if need be. In reply to applications for assistance, the Shaikh told him that the army was all ready, and that no necessary step would be omitted—a cryptic utterance, designedly vague, but effective for the time being in enabling the Shaikh to temporize. In June Farhan Assad had attacked the Shaikh's Arabs, who had built a fine dam on the Shaur river. The dam was broken out of pure wantonness, and several men killed. The army that was intended to pacify Shushtar served to bring Farhan to heel for the moment, and the Shaikh as usual24 permitted himself to be cajoled by Farhan's promises to behave well in future. As was to be expected Farhan returned to his tribe only to recommence his intrigues with Abdul Rahim, who, on behalf of the Sardar Zafar, promised to support him in rebellion against the Shaikh. In October things reached a crisis : Farhan and the Bani Turuf likewise incited by Abdul Rahim declined to pay the revenue or to pay compensation (in the case of Farhan) for damage done to the Shaikh's tribes and property on the Shaur. The Shaikh again collected an army at Nasiri and had no option but to march against Farhan after the latter had definitely refused to come to Nasiri. The Shaikh's force left Nasiri on the 21st November and had scarcely reached the boundaries of Farhun's lands when the bulk of the latter's tribesmen joined the Shaikh's forces. He himself took refuge in his fort at Deh Nau with a few followers, and about 45 Bakhtiari sowars, who had been sent to his assistance by Aqa Rahim. A large number would have been sent had not the adherents of the family of the late Ilkhani (Husain Quli Khan) warned Aqa Rahim that if he did not cease supporting Farhan they on their part would join the Shaikh's army and fight on the Shaikh's side. They collected their forces in readiness to prove the reality of their intentions, and thus prevented the possibility of a collision between the Bakhtiari and the Shaikh from taking an acute form. The assertion of the Sardar Assad to His Majesty's Minister, made in connection with these troubles, that the Shaikh's jurisdiction did not extend to Farhan and that he was not charged with the duty of enforcing the pay ment of revenue by him need not be examined here. It is sufficient here to note that such assertions were made in justification of the attitude adopted by Aqa Rahim but were in no way substantiated. g TA TEMENl belgi leges regae ME i VT arisen On tli&lt; of the old proposal c Governmei sliicliwoi] proposed. eiilnn,ai tlie 5 per cknts I k duty, Sof Customs fflents wei In'A or at all e Upti tleSkik oi Mohan The ; dut The to] in the co Kveiiue WtoT( «hthe Int l0 Ciist( %cii In only ti H 'Tl25 CHAPTER V. Statement of the Circumstances attending the Establishments of the Belgian Customs Administration in 'Arabistan, showing the Privi leges and Responsibilities of the Shaikh of Mohammerah in that regard, the attitude and undertakings of hls majesty's govern ment to the Shaikh in the matter, and the Difficulties which have arisen between the shaikh and the customs up to the present day. On the 21st March 1900, the control of the Customs of the Gulf was taken under the direct management of the Persian Government, and Custom houses established at Bushire, Bandar 'Abbas and Lingah. At first it was intended to impose a uniform import duty of 5 per cent, ad valorem, instead of the old specific rates on all goods imported by native merchants. This proposal caused much excitement and was stoutly opposed. The Persian Government therefore decided to introduce a new tariff on a sliding scale which would be more favourable to native merchants than the 5 per cent, rate proposed. This tariff was also opposed, but the Persian Government remain ed firm, and by the first week in August the new tariff came into force. Eight months later, the Customs Administration succeeded in bringing into force the 5 per cent, rate for all native-owned goods and native and foreign mer chants henceforward were on the same footing as regards the payment of duty. So far as the latter were concerned, the establishment of the Belgian Customs Administration was beneficial and various much-needed improve ments were effected under the new regime. In 'Arabistan, however, special conditions prevailed which did not exist, or at all events not in the same degree, elsewhere in the Gulf. Up till 1903 1 the Customs-houses of 'Arabistan were under the control of the Shaikh who farmed them from Government for an annual sum decided on at Nau Ruz. Exemptions from Customs duties were allowed to the Shaikh of Mohammerah and to his headmen, as well as to numerous other officials. The principal articles imported for Shaikh's tribes, such as tea, coffee, arms and ammunition imported, and dates, dried fruits, wool, etc., exported, were duty free. With these exceptions, the duties imposed were generally speaking the same as at other Gulf Ports. The establishment of a Customs department on European lines, there fore, to put in force a tariff which heavily taxed such necessaries as sugar, tea and coffee, and prohibited the import of arms, was more than a mere ad ministrative reform, it was a revolution involving sudden and serious increase in the cost of the necessaries of life. 2 It affected the pocket of all alike and revenue derived from this charge was spent not in the locality but was remit ted to Tehran in liquidation of State debts from which 'Arabistan, in common with the rest of Persia, had gained nothing. In the more remote parts of the province such as Hawlzeh and Fallahiyeh, no Customs duties worthy of the name had ever been exacted and any attempt to do so would have met with strenuous opposition, and ultimate violence, from the Arab tribes of the locality. Eight years' experience of the Customs has not diminished this feeling and the Customs in Fallahiyeh still work very circumspectly and collect but little revenue, whilst in Hawlzeh they are non-existent. 3 In his strong opposition to the Customs therefore, Shaikh Khazal was only reflecting the attitude of his tribesmen, though he, of course, also stood to lose financially by the change. Has principal objection, however, 1 In July 1897, an attempt was made to establish a Persian Custom-house at Mohammerah, but this fell through owing to the opposition of Shaikh Khaz'al. 2 The new tariff was not put in force till 1903, but its advent was foreseen. Proposals to establish a Customs post here were under consideration of the Customs Administration in 1910-11 ; though it was officially denied that any such step was in contemplation.26 seems to have been that the establishment of the Customs at Mohammerah was preliminary to a further extension of the powers of the Central Govern ment in his territories and that it would be followed by other measures of the same kind, which would result in the curtailment and ultimate extinction of his authority and privileges. Thus it came about that, in order to placate him and secure his acquies cence in the new regime, the Persian Government found it necessary to give him three farmans recognizing the proprietary rights of himself and of his tribes in the districts then under his control, so far as they had not been already alienated to the Nizam-es-Saltaneh, and securing him and his tribes against any future increase of taxation. Translations of these farmans are printed as Appendices to this precis. On the 20th January 1900, Sir H. M. Durand, His Majesty's Minister at Tehran, wrote to Col. Meade on the subject of the proposed establishment of the Imperial Persian Customs at Mohammerah as follows :— I hear the Belgians and the Sadr 'Azam are determined to take over the Moham- merah Customs, but by amicable arrangement with the Shaikh, if possible: 1 have advised them not to try to force him. In a memorandum enclosed in the same letter he wrote :— As to the withdrawal of the Customs from Mohammerah, I will do all I can to help him. He may rely upon our hearty good will at all times and upon our help whenever we can give it without ill faith to the Persian Government. Later, in 1900, the proposal to establish a Persian Customs Department in 'Arabistan officered by Belgians was actively pushed and the Shaikh up- proached privately on the subject on behalf of the Government by Persian friends in Tehran. The Shaikh told His Majesty's Consul that if he allowed such a contin gency to come to pass, his tribes would revolt and depose him, if not kill him, for having betrayed his trust. The least he could do would be to resign and retire to his estates in Turkey. The most he could do would be to rebel. He feared that the Persians would gradually reduce his power, taking one dis trict from him after another, and recollected the story of Khalifa Amin bin Harun-ar-Rashid, who, as his brother advanced agaidst bim said ' What is left is enough ' till only Baghdad remained : then he said ' Baghdad is enough ' till his brother took Baghdad and killed him. Persians, he said, had never been able to manage Arabs except through Arabs, and compared his position vis d vis Persia to that of Khedive of Egypt vis d vis Turkey. At an interview with Colonel Meade, then Political Resident at Bushire, on 11th March 1900 the latter told the Shaikh that the Persian Government wished to establish a Custom-house at Mohammerah, and that in common with other powers they had the right to collect dues at their own ports. The financial stability of Persia depended on the proposed establishment of Customs, which we could not oppose, and he hoped that some compromise was possible. The Shaikh said it was impossible, his headmen had never paid dues, and dates had always been free, whilst the districts of Fallahiyeh and Jar- rahi had never yet accepted a Customs department. His tribes, moreover, had from ancient times collected Rahdari, a privilege prized rather for the prestige which it carried than for the pecuniary gain. He had hitherto had no official intimation on the subject. Colonel Meade replied that we could not advise him to accept or refuse the proposals : all we could do was to express a hope that a compromise might be possible. In 1901 much the same line was still taken on this subject by Shaikh Khazal who looked upon the establishment of the Customs as a preliminary step of the Persian Government, at the instance of Russia, to reduce his power, on account of his pro-English tendencies of which successive Kargu- zars often complained. He had he said taken off the steamers which his27 brother Miz'al used to run in opposition to Lynch, patrolled the Shatt-al-'Arab and safeguarded our interests in every way possible. In the earlier stages of the negotiations for the establishment of Customs at Mohammerah a proposal was made by His Majesty's Minister to the Foreign Office that we should guarantee payment by the Persian Government to the Shaikh of the sum agreed on as indemnification to the latter for the re moval from his hands of the management of the Customs. The Shaikh was asked to submit definite proposals. It appeared from a telegram from His Majesty's Minister to the Resi dent that if the Shaikh refused to come to terms a Customs cordon would be drawn round Mohammerah, the ' Persepolis ' being stationed at the mouth of the Shatt-al-'Arab to prevent all ships from entering into Mohammerah until they had produced a receipt for duty paid at Bushire on goods for Mohammerah. The obvious impracticability of such a scheme needs no de monstration. Negotiations for the establishment at Mohammerah of the Persian Cus toms proceeded actively during the winter and spring of 1901-02 and finally the Persian Government agreed to grant a farman recognising the rights of Arabs in land cultivated ' up to date.' To this reservation, the Shaikh strongly objected, and the phrase was eventually deleted. Haji Rais who had been sent as the Shaikh's envoy at Tehran, arrived there early in April and consulted His Majesty s Minister frequently during the course of the negotiations, and received advice on many points ; at the Minister's suggestion he caused the farman to be in the name of the Shaikh and of his Arabs. 1 Haji Rais at the close of the negotiations expressed his great gratitude for the assistance and support which he had received from His Majesty's Legation. It was agreed that dates and all fruits, fresh or dry, should be free of duty; a salary was to be paid to the Shaikh by deduction from maliyat. In addition to the letters and farmans eventually obtained a second letter was intended to be sent by the Shah to the Shaikh stating that he had forbidden the alienation of lands in S. Persia, but should he at any t ^ in ^ a . 1 er this, and sell the Fallahiyeh, Deh Mulla and Hindij an districts, the Shaivb would have the rights of pre-emption. In May 1902, the negotiations in regard to the Customs which had dragged on for nearly three years reached their conclusion, largely owing to the tact and diplomatic skill of -Haji Rais, whom the Shaikh had sent o Tehran as his envoy to discuss the question. The Persian Government accepted all the Shaikhs demands, but insisted on a Belgian Director of Customs. They refused to declare the whole ot Mohammerah to be the property of the Arabs, but were prepared to recognize their proprietary rights in the date groves and all cultivated lands. The Shaikh was recommended to accept this compromise and did so 2 The settlement in regard to the Customs was embodied m two documents (Appendices 10 and 11 to this compilation), its principal features are as follows :— _ Shaikh to be Director General of Customs of Arabistan and to give effect to orders of Ministry of Customs. A Belgian and Assistant to be sent to give effect to new system; the Belgian to have rank departmental Head but to accept and comply with counsels and orders of Shal ^ h a nd occasions in regard to matters pertaining to the Customs affecting Arabs and the local population. His Excellency to give fullest assistance to all Customs officials and to assist them to levy the 5 per cent, import tax (the new ta was not introduced till 14h February 1903). tors, authorising them to cultivate waste land and to give the ^ ^ P ^ gardens had nol lapsed to him and were cultivated by Fallahs who only get half the ciop, or less. 2 Ostensibly on this ground amongst others, Monsieur Passek .RussianConsulGeneral at Bushire, invested he Shaikh early in 1903 with the Insignia of the 1st class of the Order of St. Stanislaus. e 228 Dates and other fruits fresh and dry produced in Mohammerah to be entirely and always exempt and free from Customs dues. Grain exported to be taxed as at other ports. Shaikh to receive salary of 12,000 tomans a year for his services. The lands of the Karun, Mohammerah, and 'Abbadan Island to be granted to Shaikh. Deh Mulla and Hindij an also to be granted to him. 1 The Shaikh was also exempted from liability to pay Customs dues on household neces saries and foodstuffs other than tea and wines; 2 and this concession was subsequently extended to all articles for his personal use the importation of which was not prohibited {vide Annex. 3 to this Chapter). The administration of the Customs at Mohammerah was taken over by Monsieur Waffelaert on 23rd September 1902 and Custom-houses were established at Nasiri, Dizful and Shushtar. The imposition of the new tariff on 14th February 1903 caused much discontent throughout the Gulf, but no disturbances took place in 'Arabistan. On December 24th, 1903, Sir Arthur Hardinge, who was at the time returning to Tehran after touring in the Gulf with Lord Curzon, addressed the following letter to the Shaikh, in accordance with telegraphic instructions received from the Foreign Office, on the subject of the attempts that were being made by the Persian Government to break the conditions subject to which the Shaikh had permitted the establishment of Customs in Moham merah :— Yom Excellency— I have received a telegram in reply to the one which I sent to His Majesty's Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs from Mohammerah after my first inter view with Your Excellency. Lord Lansdowne says that, if, as he presumes is the case from my account of Your Excellency's statement to me, the Persian Government is really attempting to repudiate the arrangement made with you last year, I am authorised to say that you are in his opinion justified in opposing such attempt. He instructs me to remind you of the message which he sent you last year and to add that you may rest assured of the support of the British Government so long as you on your side observe the conditions of the arrangement made between the Persian Government and yourself. He has authorised me to point out to that Government the necessity for respecting the conditions of the arrangement on their side, but I do not propose to do so until I hear further from you as I think it will be better in the interests of good relations between the Persian Government authorities and yourself that our intervention should not be invoked until all the means of adjusting matters between them and you have been exhausted. Meanwhile I should be glad if you would send me to Tehran a copy of the note from Monsieur Naus promising not to take duty on your personal imports, and any further information on this question. This letter was handed to Shaikh on 27th January 1904, and a verbal answer given by Haji Rais, which was sent to Bushire on 25th February 1904 by Major E. B. Burton, then Acting Vice-Consul at Mohammerah. In 1904, the Shaikh had legitimate grounds for complaint at the action of the Customs in ignoring his authority and taking upon themselves respon sibility for policing the river. S. S. ' Muzaffari ' was despatched from Bushire without his being informed, and seized country boats on various pretexts. When the cashier of the Mohammerah Customs absconded with the cash to Karachi, the Shaikh at the request of the Customs issued a warrant to two of his guards to arrest the prisoner and bring him to Mohammerah. The prisoner was extradited, detained at the Customs and subsequently taken to Bushire by Monsieur Waffeleart though the offence was committed within the Shaikh's jurisdiction making it appear that the Customs desired to ignore his position not only as Director General of the Customs but also as Governor. 1 Separate farmans on the points, granting the Shaikh's request, wereiss ied (ride Appendices 7, 8 and 9). 1 Vide Annex. 1, letter from Mirza Yantz to Shaikh, dated 27th Rabi-ul-Aval 1323 = June 1903.In October 1904, the local Customs officer announced 1 that he had in structions to collect 'office dues' on shipments of dates, this the Shaikh declined to admit. A similar claim in regard to ' cabotage ' was raised by the Customs and decided in favour of the Shaikh. In 1906, on the arrival of Monsieur Leleux, difficulties again arose between the Shaikh and the Customs, mainly owing to the resentment of the former at the attitude of Monsieur Leleux who constantly ignored the Shaikh's farmans and his rights and privileges in regard to the Customs. The Shaikh complained in September 1908, in response to representa tions by His Majesty's Consul regarding the increase of smuggling, that he could not be responsible for what went on in the Customs as long as the Bel- gain Directors in contravention of his farman, neglected to take his orders in regard to the appointment of minor officials. This tendency, he said, had been noticeable even since 1906, and in particular during the tenure of office of Monsieur Leleux. His Majesty's Consul added that with the present high duties it was not possible to put an end to smuggling and the only way to reduce it was to secure the co-operation of the Shaikh. The alternative would be to get rid of the Shaikh's supervision altogether and no longer acknowledge him as Director, a policy which would inevitably lead to increased smuggling, unless the scale of duties was revised. Early in 1909, the Nationalist troubles in Tehran, which resulted in the deposition of Muhammad Ali Shah, became acute and the Bushire Custom house was taken over by the Nationalists on the 22nd March. The Shaikh had already, in December 1909, pointed out to Major Cox that he was anxious as to the effect of the revolutionary movement in Persia on his position. He represented that the greater part of Persia was completely out of control, that payment of revenue had been suspended all over the country and that he was in a strong position, were he to consider his personal interests alone, to refuse revenue and turn out the Belgian Customs. He begged us for our advice and assistance at this juncture. He was reassured by Major Cox and encouraged not to modify the con stitutional attitude which he had hitherto maintained which was the one best calculated to enable the British Government to support his interests. As regards his relations with the popular movement, the Shaikh reiter ated his complaints against the Belgians for ignoring his farman, and said that he was being urged by both sides to declare himself. The popular party had urged him to seize the Customs and to send assistance to Tabriz, whilst requests for assistance reached him simultaneously from the Shah through the Nizam-es-Saltaneh. He was in danger of falling between two stools and asked for our advice as to what course to pursue. He was put off for the time, however, and advised to temporise until the difficulty passed over. Later on, however, on 8th March, 2 Major Cox was instructed on grounds of our policy of non-interference in internal disputes, not to comply with the Shaikh's request for advice in connection with the representations he had received from the Constitutionalists on the one hand and from the Shah on the other. Meanwhile the Constitutionalists continued to exert very strong pressure on the Shaikh and the difficulty of his position was aggravated by the fact that it was impossible for him to get any private telegrams to the Shah or Prime Minister past the Nationalist censorships at Ispahan. On the 26th March, Major Cox, who had arrived at Mohammerah re ported that the Shaikh had informed him that the situation at Mohammerah had been rendered much more critical by the news of the recent successes of the Nationalists at Bandar 'Abbas and Bushire and that he consequently anticipated that their unruly levies would now turn their attention to his outlying ports of Dllam, Hindijan, etc., and that he could not hold out much V IU/V AllllCA. 1 • 1 2 Telegram, Legation to Ecsident, No. 33, dated 8th March 1909 : ' The request for advice^ had better he ignored. If it is repeated, compliance should he refused. Advice to him on such quost'ons is incompatible with oar policy of non-iuterference in the present differences between the Shah and his people, — Barclay.30 longer, unless he could be assured that the British Government would give him effective support in resisting the Nationalists and would undertake to indemnify him against the subsequent consequences of his so doing. He added that he must take some course which would save his face with both parties. Major Cox replied that he had no power to give any guarantee in the direction desired. The Shaikh went on to explain that if the Customs receipts continued to be forwarded to Tehran, Nationalist resentment would be unrestrainable : that he, as head of the Mohammerah Customs, would be made responsible for the receipts, and that if the British were unable to intervene and refused him definite advice, he would have to be guided by his own judgment and would ask the Belgian Director to retain the receipts in the Custom-house premises until the situation had cleared somewhat. Before these representations had reached the Foreign Office, Sir George Barclay had received instructions to dissuade the Shaikh, should it be neces sary, from following the example of the Persian Nationalists at Bushire and Bandar Abbas, and seizing the Customs : in communicating these orders to Major Cox, Sir George Barclay informed him that the Shaikh's proposed action in regard to the Customs appeared to be unobjectionable. Major Cox therefore addressed the following letter to the Shaikh on April 6th : * * * I learn that Your Excellency lias ordered that until further notice, the proceeds from the Mohammerah Customs receipts are not to be sent forward to Tehran but are to be retained at Mohammerah. Hearing this news I think it is advisable to inform Your Excellency in the clearest manner possible that the Customs Revenues of the Gulf Ports including Mohammerah are pledged to the British Government as security for loans granted by the British (govern ment to the Persian Government. This matter is well known and beyond dis pute, and I trust that I shall receive from Your Excellency at an early date an assurance that in the matter of the Customs receipts the claims and interests of His Majesty's Government will be strictly safeguarded by His Excellency. In March 1909, on hearing that Monsieur Zwinne was to replace Monsieur Leleux as provincial Director of Customs at Mohammerah, Major Cox asked His Majesty's Minister to cause Monsieur Zwinne to be warned to pursue a more conciliatory policy than Monsieur Leleux. 1 Sir George Barclay in reply promised to address the Administrator as suggested but said he understood that the Shaikh's attitude in regard to smuggling gave Monsieur Leleux genuine cause to be aggrieved. He asked Mr. McDouall to bring to his notice the next specific case which came to his knowledge where the Shaikh had ground for any complaint against the Customs. In reply to this telegram Colonel Cox, whilst promising to talk to the Shaikh on the subject of smuggling pointed out that Shaikh Khazal in 1908 had maintained that Monsieur Leleux was entirely to blame for the increase of smuggling saying that ' he could not be expected to suppress smuggling if the Belgians appointed persons without consulting him as required by his farman.' On 16th July 1909, with reference to the coup d'etat in Tehran resulting in the deposition of Mohamed 'Ali Shah by the Nationalist troops. Major Cox addressed a further communication to the Shaikh on the subject as follows :— I have the honour to refer you to my letter of April last regarding the necessity for your keeping the Customs revenues under complete control. Since then the state of Persia has again been disturbed. The authorities of the British Government like Your Excellency are hopeful that the Constitutional regime will eventually be firmly established, but in the meantime it is necessary for me to remind you that the Customs in your district are included in the Customs which, on account of the loan that has been advanced to the Persian Govern ment, are pledged to the British Government, and if your Customs revenues should be expended in a way that may be prejudicial to our claims on them. Your Excellency will incur responsibility to the above Government. In March 1911, the Shaikh telegraphed to Tehran that if, as he heard, M. Zwinne was to return to Mohammerah, he would refuse to accept him as Director, and eventually, on his arrival, did so, and secured his transfer to another post.31 In September 1909, the Shaikh's differences with the Customs again became prominent, and at intervals in 1910 friction occurred over minor points of administration. In October 1910, the replacement of Shaikh Abdul Husain, a Persian subject naturalised in British India, by a Persian from the Mohammerah Customs, was contested by the Shaikh on the ground that he had not been consulted or afforded an opportunity of looking into the case, but in this case, as in others, the Shaikh, though loud in his protestations of resentment at the action of the Customs, has exhibited a disinclination to press his objections home, or to carry his contentions to their logical conclusion. Successive Customs officials have not been allowed to take advantage of his supineness, and have steadily consolidated their position and contrived gradually to render the most important parts of his farman inoperative.

The purport is as follows:— In accordance with the order of His Imperial Majesty none of the Princes or the principal officers of State nor even the Wali Ahd or the Prime Minister are free from liability to pay Customs dues and must pay duties like every one else. But in view of the great assistance that the Sardar Arfa has given to the Customs we have made him Director General of the 'Arabistan Customs that he may be free of Customs duties, that is in respect of household necessaries and foodstuff other than tea and wines. As this is not a public matter no official order on the subject will be issued, but goods on arrival must be examined as usual on arrival in all cases. Annex. 2.

Dambraine has written. Your Excellency has done what is necessary to assist the Customs, and it is to be hoped that with your assistance bit by bit the Mohammerah Customs will become efficient, and for this reason I offer you my sincere thanks. Regarding what M. Dambraine wrote that Your Excellency had asked that goods imported on your name should be free, I must say that such a con cession would be difficult to give since even goods imported by himself are subject to duty. Nevertheless in view of your assistance in organising the Customs and affection that we bear to you, M. Waffelaert has given permission to the Mudir to admit free of duty articles (the importation of which is not prohibited) imported on your name for your personal use.

Shaikh Miz'al Khan, son of Haji Jabir Khan, was assassinated on July 3rd, 1S97, when landing from his boat opposite his palace at Failiyah. The actual murderers were three negroes who seem to have been instigated to commit the deed by Salman bin Mansur, the chief of the Muhaisin tribe, a cousin of Miz ? al. Shaikh Khaz'al is supposed to have been privy to the murder, even if he did not actually instigate it. It was feared at first that the sudden death of Shaikh Miz'al would give rise to trouble, but nothing untoward occurred, though the population of Mohammerah went armed for a few days. The roads were unsafe through out the year, but this was owing to the bad harvests, to which cause may also be ascribed the complaints of robberies received during the year from Messrs. Hotz and Lynch Brothers. The Governorship of Mohammerah and of the tribes was at once assumed by Shaikh Khaz'al, Shaikh Miz aTs brother, after tribal election which was subsequently confirmed by the Persian Government. Shaikh Khaz'al two years before his accession had secretly announced his intention, in the event of his obtaining the Shaikhship, of encouraging British enterprise in his dominions. Until he actually became Shaikh, how- ever, the British Government were careful to give no kind of countenance to his ambitions. As soon as he became Shaikh, he told His Majesty's \ice-Consul ''that he had promised to assist British trade, should he be in position to do so, and -hat he was prepared to carry out those promises now. He wished us to know that he was secretly our friend, although it might not be politic to show it openly. He wished to serve the British Government and if he was not accepted as a servant he would still render service, hoping that he might profit by it some day.' In forwarding this expression of view Mr. McDouall expressed the belief that the underhand opposition to Karun trade which had characterised Shaikh Miz'al's rule would now cease and hoped that the Persian Government would recognise the Shaikh officially, as if an opposition candidate was to be sent up for the Governorship of Mohammerah the country would relapse into anarchy. Later on, the Shaikh told His Majesty s Consul that he was anxious, as he had said before, to encourage trade and become a servant of the British Government. Questioned as to his meaning, he ex plained that he might be deposed by the Persian Government, in which case he mio'ht need asylum at Bombay for a year or two. He added, referring apparently to the possible break up of Persia, that the Government was getting weaker every day, and that our help might some day be invaluable to The Shaikh lost no time in sending his Secretary Haji Muhammad 'Ah, Rais-ut-Tuiiar, to Tehran in order to secure his recognition by the Persian Government. On hearing this. His Majesty's Minister there instructed Mr. McDouall to advise the Shaikh to tell Haji Rais to call at the Legation as soon as possible after his arrival in Tehran: the Legation would do all in their power to protect the Shaikh's interests, and he in turn should do all that was possible to promote British commercial interests now and in the tuture in his district. The Shaikh replied he did not trust Haji Rais sufficiently to write to him in this sense, but would inform him as soon as he arrived m Tehran. Haji Rais arrived on December 21st, 1897, and was well received by the Sadr A'zam. The Persian Government at once confirmed the Shaikh as Governor of Mohammerah, and continued to him the title of Muizz-es-ba - taneh, which his brother had borne. ^ ^ ^ _ -r. -x- -u • + 4- From the beginning he evinced a friendly disposition to British mtcrebts, and withdrew the steamer which had been run by his predecessor in opposi-34 tion to the ' Malamir ' on the Karun. His alarm at the threatened encroach ments by the Persian Government upon his authority, and at the possibility of Turkish ambitions finding an outlet in the conquest of 'Arabistan caused him, as early as 1899, to seek to obtain a secret understanding for his protec tion by the British Government. He said that he did not at that stage wish to press for written assurances. All he wanted was a verbal assurance that we accepted him as a servant, and that we would support him by such means as the Legation thought desirable. He said that he did not ask for an alliance against the Persians, whom he had, and would continue to serve faithfully, though they might not appreciate his actions. The Legation, for instance, he said, if they considered him as their servant, would oppose the proposal to remove the Customs from his control, a step to which he would not consent. The late Shaikh Miz'al whom the Persians never interfered with, always opposed British interests : it was our duty to support him as long as he assisted our commerce, and we should not allow the Persians to diminish his influence. His proposals were sent on to the Government of India, but it was not then considered desirable to have closer political relations with the Shaikh. Colonel Meade, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, writing to His Majes ty's Consul, Mohammerah, on the 20th May 1899, considered it impossible for us to make a formal agreement with the Shaikh, as he was a Persian sub ject, though of course we should do our best for him. In 1900 it became known that the Persian Government intended to take the Customs of 'Arabistan under direct management, and there were rumours that an attempt would at the same time be made to deprive the Shaikh of his large executive powers and absolute tribal authority. Almost simultaneously a doubt arose as to whether the Persian Government admit that the Customs of 'Arabistan to be included in those of ' the Gulf of Fars and Fars,' which were reserved, by an agreement made with the British Government in 1897 from alienation to any foreign power as security for a loan. The danger thus suggested of a hypothecation of the Mohammerah Customs to Russia was one to which His Majesty's Government could not remain indifferent, and steps were immediately taken to guard against it by adopting a less reserved attitude towards the Shaikh, and by obtaining an assurance from the Shah's Ministers that the Customs of all Southern Persia including those of 'Arabis tan would be treated as inalienable under the agreement of 1897. This latter question was not settled satisfactorily until 1904, when a clear statement of the British view was allowed by the Persian Government to pass unchallenged, and may therefore be regarded as having obtained acceptance, an acceptance confirmed by wording of the Reglement Douanier of 1904 which was agreed to by Russia. The local problem, that of the position of the Shaikh vis a vis the Persian Government, and in particular of the department of the Imperial Customs, had a more rapid development, and is dealt with separately under the head ' Shaikh and Customs ' (Chapter V). Sir H. M. Durand wrote demi-officially to Colonel Meade on the subject of assurances as follows :— I have thouglit much about the Shaikh of Mohammerah and his request for assurances. I send you a copy of the Memorandum which I carried away from Ahwaz. I think you should tell the Shaikh that ilt I gave him the assurances he wants I should be practically committing my Government beforehand to the occupation of the country. I feel sure that my Government would not like this since we have no apprehensions as to the break up of Persia, and do not desire to take any Persian territory. At the same time it has always been our policy to oppose the interference of foreign powers in the Persian Gulf, and I presume that that policy would still remain in force as far as circumstances permitted it if the present situation .was disturbed. Do not write this, let McDouall say. I fear the Belgians and the Sadr A'zam are determined to take over the Mohammerah Customs, but by amicable arrange ment with the Shaikh if possible. I have advised them not try and force him. The following is the Memorandum enclosed in the above letter:— 'We cannot of course undertake to maintain the Shaikh against the Persian Govern- ment, nor can we say that if the Persian Government breaks up we shall35 guarantee his independence. Our Government does not, I imagine contem plate such a contingency, but we can tell him that we regard him as the most influential person in this part of the world, and that we intend as far as possible to suppoit him, believing that it is for the interest of the country that he should be strong. If ever he wants our advice lie will get it. In return we expect he will help us in matters of trade and the like. As to the withdrawal of the Customs from Mohaanmerah, I will do all I can to help him. He may rely on our hearty good will at all times, and upon our help whenever we can give it without ill-faith to the Persian Government. Sir H. M. Durand did not meet the Shaikh, but returned from Nasiri via Dizful and Luristan to Tehran. He, however, sent him the Royal Victoria Medal which the Shaikh accepted, having first obtained permission from the Central Government to do so. 1 In August 1901, a telegram was received by the Shaikh from the Gover nor-General of Luristan and Arabistan at Burujird, ordering him to make over the management of the Imperial Customs to Imperial officials, but the Shaikh, representing that scarcity prevailed and that popular feeling was unsettled, succeeded in obtaining a respite, nominally of five months. The delay brought into evidence the forces ranged on either side. On the one hand the Khans of Dashtistan near Bushire were said to have assured the Shaikh of their support, if he resisted the Customs by force, and the Bakh- tiari Khans, on whose help the Persian Government were believed to rely in case coercion of the Sheikh became necessary, declared that they would not lend themselves to any such policy, and even professed their greatest friendli ness for the threatened Shaikh. On the other hand, the Russians, who had begun to interest themselves in Mohammerah affairs urged the Persian Gov ernment in the interests of equality of trade to bring the Customs arrange ments at Mohammerah into line with those already established elsewhere. Shaikh Khaz'al, after some deliberation, proceeded to negotiate, as Sir A. Hardinge had counselled from an early stage of the difficulty. He des patched Haji Rais to Tehran, and thanks largely to that astute individual's tact and diplomatic skill, succeeded in effecting a compromise which to a very large extent safeguarded his interests. The nature of this compromise, and the means whereby it was effected are described in Chapter V. It included the grant to the Shaikh of three farmans, whereby the Shaikh was recognised as the owner, with his tribes, of (1) Mohammerah, 'Abbadan Island, the lands on the bank of the BahmanshTr river, and the ' Karun '{i.e., the banks of that river up to Ismailiyeh), (2) Fallahiyeh, (3) Hindijan and Deh Mulla, and the lands east of the Karun (but excluding the Jarrahi district). Copies of these farmans appear as appendices 7, 8 and 9 to this volume. The Persian Government at once proceeded to take advantage of the understanding, and on the 23rd September 1902 the Customs passed under Imperial control with results temporarily injurious to British commerce. It may be observed that the Persian Government, unaware of the evidence pos sessed by the British Government, subsequently denied the existence of an ' agreement' between themselves and their subject the Shaikh of Moham merah. Before the conclusion of the negotiations between the Shaikh and the Shah, and for some time afterwards, the situation was fraught with anxiety to the British Minister at Tehran. A visit of Prince Dabija, the Russian Consul at Ispahan, to Mohammerah had exposed the Shaikh to direct Russian intimidation and it is believed that Russian blandishments and threats were subsequently exercised on his envoy at the Capital, with a view to bringing about a veiled Russian protectorate over Mohammerah. At one time Shaikh Khaz'al appeared to waver, and Sir A. Hardinge feared that unless a fuller measure of confidence in the British Government could be instilled into his mind, Russian influence would soon be found supreme and active at Moham merah. The Viceroy of India, Lord Curzon, supported the Minister's view that an explicit assurance was necessary, and at length in December 190^? Lord Lansdowne authorised Sir A. Hardinge to communicate to the Shaikh 1 After consultation with H. M.'s Minister, the Shaikh did not ask for this permission in the case of his K.C.T.E. n 1910. F 236 an assurance that the British Government would protect Mohammerah against naval attack by a foreign power, whatever pretext for intervention might be alleged, and also so long as the Shaikh remained faithful to the Shah and acted in accordance witn our advice, we should continue to give our good- offices and support. The text of the letter in which this assurance was con veyed is produced as Appendix 6 to this Volume. They are still in force, not being superseded by later assurances. This letter and the personal assurances of Haji Rais who returned to Mohammerah in January 1903 convinced Shaikh Khaz'al that his interests were not in immediate danger, and the question of Mohammerah Customs gave no serious trouble till the outbreak of constitutional troubles in 1909. The letter of assurance which Sir A. Hard- inge sent to Shaikh Khaz'al was shown to Haji Rais before its despatch and he tried to induce the Minister to substitute ' protect the Shaikh of Moham merah ' against' foreign attack ' for the words ' protect Mohammerah against foreign attack.' Sir A. Hardinge in reply pointed out that their promise was to the ruler of Mohammerah in his official capacity and that he was not authorised to give a personal guarantee. He might for instance be deposed by his Arabs. The history of the next few years has no direct bearing on the question of assurances and for details of this period reference is invited to Mr. J. G. Lorimer's forthcoming Gazetteer of Persia, Vol. I. The supplementary assur ances given to the Shaikh in December 1903 in reference to the attempts of the Persian Government to repudiate the terms of the arrangement whereby the Customs had been established at Mohammerah, have been referred to in Chapter V. British interests steadily grew in importance and Mohammerah began to make its influence as a port for Central Persia felt, thanks to the Ahwaz- Ispahan Road. Irrigation schemes on the Karun proposed by a Dutch Engineer, Mr. Van Roggen, at one time seemed likely to lead to some definite results but eventually nothing was done. A detailed description of the various schemes and the attitude of the Sheikh and of the British Government to them is given in Chapter X. In March 1904, the Russian Consul-General from Bushire, M. Passek, paid a visit to Mohammerah and invested the Shaikh with the Russian Order of the First Class of St. Stanislaus. The farman which accompanied this decoration recited the Shaikh's enlightened policy and his wisdom in permit ting the establishment of the Imperial Customs as the reasons for granting it. It wat not until the autumn of 1907 that a further formal presentment of the desire of the Shaikh, as well as of the Bakhtiari Khans, for closer rela tions with His Majesty's Government was made to His Majesty's Minister by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. After careful consideration, it was decided to be undesirable to give the Bakhtiari Khans any assurances beyond a general expression of sympathy, and even when giving this it was found necessary to authorise His Majesty's Consul at Ahwaz to couple it with warning to the Khans that unless thev adopted a more amenable attitude to British interests the sympathies of His Majesty's Government would be alienated. In the case of the Shaikh of Mohammerah, however, the general assurances given to him in 1903 by Sir A. Hardinge were repeated and ex tended to his successors, and it was further pointed out that His Majesty's Government have agreed to respect the independence and integrity of Persia, which involves the maintenance of the status quo in that country, and in cluded the continuance of his present status of autonomy : external aggression on him, therefore, would constitute an infringement of Persian integrity which is recognised by the Anglo-Russian Convention. These assurances were conveyed to the Shaikh by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf in a letter, dated 1st December 1908, which ran as follows :— T am directed to repeat on behalf of His Majesty's Government the assurances given to Your Excellency in the letter of His Majesty's Minister, Sir A. Hardingre, dated 7th December 1902, which is in your possession, and the terms of which I repeated to you at our interview (on the 7th January): and I am then to add that His Majesty's Government have engaged to respect the independence37 of Persia and to explain that that undertaking involves the maintenance of the status quo in that country, and includes the continuance of the state of autonomy which Your Excellency at present enjoys. It follows from the above that any external aggression upon Your Excellency would constitute an infringement of Persian integrity which is recognised by the terms of the ' Anglo-llussian Convention. * * * * The extension of his assurances to his successors was very satisfactory to the Shaikh, but he was not wholly satisfied, and desired some means where by he himself, with his property and tribes might come to some extent at all events under British protection. He expressed a desire to find some means whereby British capital might be invested in his lands, thus increasing our stake in his country. He complained bitterly of the expense to which he was put in keeping order in his territories, and said he only did so in the hope of obtaining our support. Twelve months later when the Political Resident again visited the Shaikh,^ the situation had greatly changed. On the one hand, oil had been struck in paying quantities in the Bakhtiari Oil Field and a Company had been formed to work it, and to construct a pipe line through the Shaikh's territories to a point on the Shatt-al-'Arab where a refinery was to be erected ; on the other hand, the revolutionary movement was daily gaining strength in Persia and the Shaikh was much perturbed at its possible effect on his own position. He earnestly begged that further assurances might be granted to him, and His Majesty's Government, in view of the magnitude of the British interests then developing so rapidly in 'Arabistan, were more disposed than before to look more favourably on his requests which may be summarized as follows :— (1) To be assured that the British Government would not allow any Persian regime, absolute or constitutional to disturb the status quo in regard to himself and his successors. (2) That so long as he fulfilled his obligations to us, the British Gov ernment would not disturb it. (3) That His Majesty's Government would oppose any power attempt ing to do so. When the Shaikh realised that a dynastic guarantee was impossible, he earnestly begged that the assurances already given to him might be extended at all events to his immediate offspring provided that they gave us satisfac tion. He said that he was quite ready to satisfy us as to the concurrence of the tribunal of Shaikhs. Sir E. Grey had, however, before these requests had been communicated to His Majesty's Government, already provided the instructions given to Major Cox by Sir George Barclay in respect of the revolutionary movement, and the assurances required by the Shaikh. Sir E. Grey added ' Great Britain and Russia having promised to respect Persian integrity, we cannot admit the possibility of her ceasing to be a Sovereign State or being occupied by Foreign Powers; our assurances would be more binding than ever in the eventuality which the Sheikh contemplates. He should not forget the danger of losing his strong and unhampered position by engaging in political party connections.' The instructions referred to above as given to Major Cox by Sir George Barclay were to the following effect:— He was to refuse advice to the Shaikh in reply to requests for counsel on the con stitutional issue. He was to inform the Shaikh, if he thought that as regards the Turko-Persian boundary, in the Mohammerah district, His Majesty's Government were not prepared to recognise any other frontier than that laid down by the Mediating Commissioners in 1850. Any advance of Ottoman troops in the neighbourhood of Mohammerah likely to cause a dis turbance of the status quo there would not improbably lead to active inter vention on the part of His Majesty's Government. 1 On the 5th April, Major Cox intimated to His Majesty's Minister with reference to the assurances to be given to the Shaikh, that these might satisfy i A detailed account, of the Turko-Persian frontier question as far it affects 'Arabistan will be found in Chapter VIII as also a precis of the correspondence on the subject of the situation to which this pronouncement gave rise.38 him, so far as they concerned the break up of Persia, or the intervention of foreign powers, but that he would require some definite reply as to whether the guarantees already given him included protection on his rights by a possible constitutional regime, and also in regard to an extension of existing guarantee to his immediate offspring. In reply. Major Cox was instructed to inform the Shaikh that His Majesty's Government were prepared to give him the same support against encroachments on his rights as was promised in 1902, whatever change of Government there might be in Persia. He was also to be reminded that the /assurances of His Majesty's Government had already been extended to his successors, and as these would presumably be his offspring, the assurances did in fact already apply to them. If, however, this did not satisfy the Shaikh, there was no objection to extending the guarantee already given to ' his heirs and successors.' The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf having communicated these assurances, the Shaikh further requested— (1) that the words ' his own successive male descendants ' might be substituted for ' heirs and successors ' and he (2) also expressed the hope that His Majesty's Government would dispel the last shadow of doubt from his mind regarding their intentions in the future by adding after the words ' male des cendants ' the words ' up to a period of 100 years ' or 150 if possible. The Political Resident promised to mention these points to His Majes ty's Minister, whom he hoped iShortly to meet, as also the Shaikh's requests for (3) an assurance for protection for his private property in Persia, (4) an assurance of protection against molestation by foreign powers, ana against any encroachment by such power on his jurisdic tion and recognised rights, (5) an undertaking that, if circumstances compelled His Majesty's Government to assume control of the Customs of Southern Per sia, including those of Mohammerah and Ahwaz, he will be left in immediate control of those ports as at present, (6) an undertaking that if circumstances compelled His Majesty's Government to intervene in Southern Persia he and his tribes men may be maintained in their present position, or if that is impossible, he may retain his personal revenues, and be granted an asylum in India or elsewhere, (7) a copy of the assurances in a form which he could show to his tribesmen to strengthen their support of himself, and their belief in the friendly policy of His Majesty's Government. At this juncture. Major Cox proceeded on leave to England. From London he went on to Tehran to confer with His Majesty's Minister, and both in London and in Tehran the question of the assurances which the Shaikh desired were exhaustively discussed. After further protracted examination of the question at Tehran, on the occasion of Major Cox's visit there, and between the Foreign Office and the India Office, the assurances in their revised form, were finally approved and the text forwarded to Colonel Cox in August 1910. He was instructed, however, not to communicate them to the Shaikh, until His Majesty's Government had examined the merits of the case of the Wali of Basrah against the Shaikh in the matter of the allegations against the latter which had culminated in the shelling and burning of the villagre of Zain by the Turkish gunboat ' Marmaris.' This question is dealt with under the heading ' The Shaikh and the Turks ' (Chapter 9) and need not be further referred to here. His Majesty's Government having concluded the examination of the papers in this case and having satisfied themselves that the Shaikh had acted properly in the matter and that the general allegations against him were unfounded authorised Lieutenant-Colonel Cox to communicate the revised as surances to the Shaikh. The latter's request for a time limit had been nega tived and the application of the assurances to the male descendants were granted only so long as the latter fulfilled their obligations to His Majesty'sGovernment and to the Persian Government and also remained acceptable to their tribesmen. The assurances of protection for his private property in Persia and against molestation or encroachment on his rights by a foreign power were granted with the reservation that the British Government could not bind itself to forcible intervention in certain circumstances which might arise, but in such cases the Shaikh would receive the strongest possible diplomatic support. The undertaking in regard to the Customs was negatived, and the Shaikh informed that the contingency foreseen was one that His Majesty's Government could not contemplate {vide Major Cox's letter of the 1st Decem ber 1908 to the Shaikh). A request for a copy of the assurances in a form that could be shown to the tribunal of Shaikhs was granted. It was also agreed that His Majesty the King should be asked to confer an honorary K.C.I.E. on the Shaikh, a favour which could not fail to be pleasing to him, and which would at the same time afford a pretext for inter vention on his behalf if necessary. On October 15th, Colonel Cox invested the Shaikh with the insignia of a K.C.I.E., at a public Durbar at Failiyeh and immediately afterwards com municated to him confidentially the text of the assurances as finally approved by His Majesty's Government which ran as follows :— I am authorised to inform Tour Excellency that whatever changes may take place in the form of the Government of Persia, and whether it be Royalist or Nationalist, His Majesty's Government will be prepared to afford you the support necessary for obtaining a satisfactory solution in the event of any encroachment by the Persian Government on your jurisdiction and recognised rights, and on your property in Persia. 1 In like manner they will safeguard you to the best of their ability against an unprovoked attack 2 by a foreign power or against any encroachment by such a power on your said jurisdiction and recognised rights or on your property in Persia. 3 These assurances are given for yourself and are intended to apply to your male decendants so long as you and they shall not have failed to observe your obligations towards the Central Government and shall continue to be acceptable to your tribesmen, 4 to be guided by the advice of His Majesty's Government and to maintain an attitude satisfactory to them. Before investing the Shaikh with the insignia of a K.C.I.E., the Political Resident addressed the following remarks to him, in English, a translatioi? afterwards being read out by the Residency Munshi:— Y our E xcellency, It is over a year now since I have had the pleasure of visiting you ashore, owing to firstly to absence in Europe and secondly to quarantine difficulties since my return. This has been a cause of regret to me, but I am very glad to be able to visit Your Excellency in your palace at Failiyeh, and the pleasure of coming has been greatly enhanced by the auspicious nature of my present errand. I am commanded by His Majesty's Government to announce to Your Excellency that my august sovereign. King George the Fifth—may his kingdom endure—has been pleased to confer on you the high honour of a Knight Commandership of the Indian Empire and I am on their behalf to present you with the Insignia thereof. This indication of good will and esteem on the part of His Majesty's Government, is conferred on Your Excellency as a mark of their appreciation of your sustained efforts to preserve order and security for trade in the districts under your control and thereby to assist the progress of civilization and commerce. Unfortunately as we all know, many districts in Persia have now for a long time been disturbed and trade routes interrupted. It is therefore all the more a matter of congratulation to you 1 On the 24th April 1910, under instructions from His Majesty 's Minister His Majesty's Consul for 'Arabistan had verbally informed the Shaikh that ' our assurances in so far as they refer to aggression on the part of the Persian Government, apply equally to the Sardar Assad as long as he is Minister of Interior. 2 But see the assurances given by Sir A. Hardinge in 1903 in which assurances were given against naval attack by a foreign power whatever pretext for such intervention might be alleged. These assurances are still in force {vide Chapter IV). _ •••**••&gt; 3 In giving these assurances Colonel Cox added a verbal explanation to the effect that whilst His Majesty's Government were perfectly sincere in their intentions towards the Shaikh and had therefore given these assur ances, yet circumstances might arise in which it would be impossible to intervene by force on his behalf. In such a case he would of course receive strong diplomatic support. This reservation, however, did not disturb the Shaikh in the least. He replied that he quite understood it adding that as lorg as he could_ feel assured that we really meant to safeguard him to the best of our ability in case of emergency it was sufficient for him. (The substance of the conversation in which this communication was made was reduced to writing.) 4 The words ' to be acceptable to your tribesmen ' were omitted in the second copy of the assurances delivered to the Shaikh with a demi-official letter by the Political Resident.40 that this region has not fallen into a similar plight. With this short preface, I will proceed to present Your Excellency with the said decoration and m doing so I only need to add the hope that you may long be preserved to render loyal and patriotic services to your own Government and to continue as in the past to promote the cordial relations which have long existed between the Shaikhs of Mohammerah and the British Government from the time of Shaikh Ha]i Jabir Khun until no^. After the investiture, Sir Shaikh Khaz'al Khan made the following reply to the Resident, the text being read out by Haji Rais on his behalf T our E xcellency, I feel most grateful and proud at this indication of the favour of His Majesty the King George the Fifth, may his kingdom endure. _ • x- i + Well aware as I am of the cordial relations and sincere friendship existing between the British Government and mv own, it is with great pride that I adorn my breas am i this August decoration and I pray God that the sincere friendship between the two Governments may be steadfast and enduring and that the Almighty may ordain that i should render service and devotion to my own Government so that by such means and by preservation of order and security in the limits and dependencies of my jurisdiction the safety of the trade routes and of internal and foreign commerce may be assured and I may earn the approval of the British Government to an increasing degree I am grateful and obliged for your presence here to-day, and beg you to convey my most sincere thanks to the British Government for the great distinction now con ferred on me, l Copies of both these speeches were handed afterwards to the Karguzar in order that he might have no excuse for making misrepresentations as to what took place. , . £ ... A • The Shaikh subsequently confirmed the above expression ot gratitude m the following communication to the Resident dated the 16th October 1910 : A fter compliments. Though I expressed my gratitude in my speech at yesterday's gathering, I fee^ it necessary now to convey my thanks more fully for the various demonstrations of good will and benevolent advice with which I have been favoured during the three years past by Your Honour and the High Authorities the British Goyernment Signs which have been present alike during the struggle between the Part.sans of despotism and constitutionalism: in connection with the aggressive proceedings of the ^ ah of Basrah at Kut-i-Zain (in regard to which they found me to be in the right); m the increase ot my salute as a personal distinction 2 and now in the bestowal of this present honour with its August Insignia and in other ways which are a source of encouragement to me I feel the utmost gratitude and pride for these favours, and it goes without saying that my position in the future will be the stronger for them: while the prosperity of Mohammerah and its dependencies will be increased and foreign commerce and enter- PriSe i P beg eC that you will be good enough to communicate my representations to the high authorities of the British Government. May you be preserved, etc. The Shaikh subsequently received a telegram of congratulation from the Viceroy through the Political Resident and His Majesty's Consul and replied in suitable terms. He also received a similar telegraphic message from His Majesty's Minister. _ . . , , . ^ cn, m u * The news of the bestowal of a British decoration on the bhaakli ot Mohammerah attracted much attention both in Persia and Turkish Arabia, and the British Government and Shaikh Khaz'al were for some time the objects of much ill-informed and malevolent criticism in the native press ot Baghdad, Basrah and Tehran on this account. . , T:r . On December 8th, the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs asked His Majesty's Minister whether there was any truth in the information which had reached him that Shaikh Khaz'al was under the protection of His Majes ty's Government. In reply His Majesty's Minister said that the ShaiKh was not a British protected person but that we had special relations with him and in the event of any encroachment on his rights would give him our support. 1 The Persian Foreign Office Agent. . oi -i u 2 In 1909, the Shaikh's salute of 5 guns was increase! to 19, whrn visitm? a man-of-war as Shaikh ot Mohammerah, and a salnte of five guns was prescribed for his son when visifcmg a man-of-w^r on behalf of his father. A similar provision was made for Shaikh Mubarak. It appear frrm a letter No. 290 of 10th October 1879 from P. J. C. Robertson, E&lt;q., Assistant Political Agent, and Consul. B^rak to Lieutenant-Oolonel K U Ross'C.B., that though only entitled to live guns, Haji Jabir Khan always received 9, to which his position and rank of Amir Toman w«re supposed to entitle him.41 4 CHAPTER VII. Piracies within and at the mouth of the Shatt-al-'Arab by Arabs of the Shatt-al-'Arab, 1891—1900. The dangers to which the British Indian sailing craft and the craft of Persian Gulf principalities such as Bahrain, Kuwait and the Trucial Coast were subjected by the piratical tendencies of the Arabs who inhabit either bank of the Shatt-al-'Arab were one of the principal causes which led to the British Government to cultivate friendly relations with the Shaikh of Moham- merah. His authority over all the Arabs on the Persian side and over no small proportion of those on the Turkish side enabled him to protect shipping more effectively than the Turkish officials and it seems that the successive Shaikhs of Mohammerah, Haji Jabir, Miz'al and Khaz'al, have all made more or less sustained efforts in this direction. The salute of one gun which is fired opposite Failiyeh by all steamers of the British India Steam Navigation Com pany owes its origin to the gratitude of the Company to Haji Jabir Khan, who assisted in recovering cash stolen by pirates from the S. S. ' Cashmere ' in 1872, when at anchor at Basrah, and is a reminder of the days when piracy on the river affected even large ships. The Annual Administration Reports of the Bushire Residency record briefly the piracies in the river from 1874 onwards and it is plain that the difficulties which now prevent the effective policing of the Shatt-al-'Arab differ little from those encountered by Haji Jabir. The Arabs on the Turkish side are under no effective supervision and though in many cases they belong to Persian tribes, Turkish jealousy of external influence has hitherto made it useless to ask them to surrender even known criminals. Turkish and Persian authorities, moreover, mutually seek to fix responsibility for piracies upon the inhabitants of the opposite bank while the Arab population on either bank have frequent intercourse and have no doubt shared in many piracies. Two cases of piracies were reported in 1889 and all attempts to trace the perpetrators failed. From 1890 to 1894 no cases are reported in the Annual Reports. t i ^ j In 1895, a number of piracies were committed at the mouth of and witnm the Shatt-al-'Arab and also off the mouth of the Bahmanshir. The victims were Persian and Arab as well as British Indian vessels and some of the attacks were of the most savage and murderous character, in one case a derelict boat being found with only one corpse on board. One of the most serious cases was that of the British Indian sailing vessel ' Haripasa from Kathiawar in which four men were killed, three wounded and a large sum of money plundered. In none of these cases was any satisfaction or reparation ob tained. This outbreak of piracy stirred the British Consuls at Basrah and Mohammerah to energetic action and in 1896 the Persian and Turkish author ities agreed to adopt preventive measures by appointing posts along the river where vessels should anchor for protection at night and by arranging for nightly patrolling of the river by armed boats. H. M. S. ' Lapwing was stationed in the Shatt-al-'Arab during the autumn. In consequence of these measures no piracies took place that year in the river. A bold piracy how ever, was committed near the bar on a Kuwait boom, the Nakhuda being killed, two traders wounded and R3,000 in goods and cash looted. In 1897, three piracies on Kuwait boats took place at the mouth of the Shatt-al-'Arab, in one case R5,500 was taken and one man killed. In September of this year when the R. I- M. S. ' Lawrence ' was in the Shatt-al-'Arab information that an act of piracy had been committed on the high seas was received. The pirates were captured and made over to the Persian authorities all being Persian subjects. The pirates received 6 months imprisonment and their boats and effects were sold for the benefit of the persons they had injured-42 In December 1897, an outward bound sailing boat from Kach was attacked and plundered between Mohammerah and Fao. Two of the crew were killed. In 1898, no piracies took place, thanks to the stationing in the Shatt-al- ' Arab of a gunboat and of the special patrolling parties organised by the Turkish and Persian authorities. In 1899, though four cases of piracy took place in the Gulf none occurred in the Shatt-al-'Arab, thanks to the efforts df Shaikh Khaz'al and ithe presence of a gunboat in the river. In 1900, for the same reasons no case of piracy was reported from the Shatt-al-'Arab. i In January 1901 a Bahrain boat was attacked near Ma'amir on the Turkish side. The pirates were not traced. Four cases of piracy occurred on the bar of the Shatt-al-'Arab during the date season of this year. The great difficulty of policing the bar which extends for some 15 miles beyond Fao, and responsibility for which has not yet been assumed by the Persian or Turkish Governments, has made it the happy hunting ground of pirates who no longer venture to the extent they did of old to prosecute their ne farious trade in the river itself. On 8th April 1902, a Bahrain boat bound from Bahrain to Basrah in ballast was attacked near the second buoy on the Shatt-al-'Arab by a party of 16 Arabs who carried off E400 in cash and property. The matter was represented to the Turkish authorities who arrested a few suspected persons whom, however, the Nakhuda could not identify. On the 27th May, a Kuwait boat was attacked off Bubian I, near the entrance to the Shatt-al-'Arab by pirates who were believed to be in the employ of Yusuf bin Ibrahim of Dorah (above Fao). Some of the pirates were the residents of Dorah and Faddaghiyeh. Much property in cash and kind was carried off and one of the crew was killed. The next day an other Kuwait boat was attacked in the Hindij an creek, and 4,000 Krans cash besides other property were carried off. Representations were made to the Turkish and Persian authorities without result. Shaikh Mubarak visited the Shaikh of Mohammerah in connection with these piracies with what result is not known. Early in September 1902, expedition was organised at Dorah by Yusuf bin Ibrahim with the object of attacking Kuwait and getting rid of Mubarak. The Commander of H. M. S. ' Lapwing ' having received news of the expedi tion made a search for the dhow. On 5th September two dhows containing some 100 armed men were discovered in the Khor 'Abdallah and were as certained to be the suspected dhows. Lieutenant Commander Armstrong gave chase in four of the ship's boats. The Arabs finding they could not escape ran their dhows ashore on the Persian side of the entrance to the Shatt-al-'Arab. The ' Lapwing's' boats which were in hot pursuit came up and a fight ensued between the boats and the Arabs who had got ashore. After a sharp fighting in which one blue-jacket was killed and two wounded the Arabs fled, loosing it is believed 6 men killed and several wounded. The dhows were captured and later on destroyed. Several of the men belonging to the dhows were subsequently arrested whilst trying to cross the river to the Turkish side and were detained in custody by the Shaikh of Mohammerah. In consequence of representations made to the Turkish authorities Yusuf bin Ibrahim was told to leave Dorah and did so. 1 On the night of 26th November, a Masqat 'baghala' owned by two British subjects was pirated in the river while she was lying off Ma amir on the Turkish side. One of the crew was killed and the Nakhuda wounded and cash value 400 dollars and other property carried off. In February 1903, another Kuwait boat was attacked in the Khor Musa. A passenger and four of the crew were killed and a large amount of cash and property carried off. 1 Tt is generally believed he was secretly supported by the Turks : disappointed of them he -joined Bin Eashid and died in Hail about 1905.43 Shaikh Mubarak invariably charged Yusuf bin Ibrahim with respon sibility for the piracies, but with the exception of the ' Lapwing ' incident no definite proof against the man was adduced. Two piracies were reported to have occurred in the third week of August on the bar of the Shatt-al-'Arab. One of the pirated boats belonged to Kuwait and representations were made on behalf of Shaikh Mubarak to the local authorities. ' In February 1904, a sailing vessel belonging to Karachi was attacked and scuttled 20 miles beyond the outer buoy of the Shatt-al-'Arab, two of the crew being killed and 400 baskets of dates and the ship's gear being taken. It is believed the pirates had followed the ship down the river, and attacked her when she had got outside and out of sight of land. The Government of India offered a reward of R1,000 for information which might lead to the discovery and conviction of the offenders but without result. Four minor cases of piracy occurred on the Shatt-al-'Arab or near its mouth—two on Bahrain and two on Kuwait boats. During 1906, no piracies were recorded, but in the murder of Mr. Glanviile, an employe of Messrs. Lynch Brothers at M'agil near Basrah, caused considerable stir and a gunboat was kept in the Shatt-al-'Arab during the autumn. In November 1906, a family of Arabs known as the ' sons of Humaidi,' himself a noted outlaw, residing on the Dashti coast in the neighbourhood of the port of Daiyir, pirated a Persian boat at sea between Kais Island at the mainland at Taona. They killed all the occupants except one boy whom they threw overboard thinking he was dead, seized the cargo valued at R6,000 and scuttled the dhow. The wounded boy managed to reach the shore in a half-dead condition and was eventually succoured by some residents of Taona, who found him lying on the strand when passing from hamlet to another. As soon as he had sufficiently recovered to make a statement he gave an account of the occurrence. It appeared that the dhow of these ' sons of Humaidi' had been lying beside the pirated dhow in the dry dock at Lingah for some days, the pirates no doubt watching what was put into her. When the Shivuh vessel put to sea the pirate dhow followed soon afterwards and committed the piracy the same night. In January 1907, a Kuwait' bum ' en route from Basrah to Kuwait, with a number of well-to-do passengers, male and female, failed to reach its destination. A short time afterwards the boom appears to have stranded on the Island of Amair on the Arab Coast, where she was salved by the inhabitants. While reported to have borne no trace whatever of having encountered bad weather and although her gear was intact a corpse or skeleton was found tied to her anchor cable and the decks of the craft were covered with stains indicating that a bloody struggle had taken place. On being taken to Bahrain by the salvers for sale she was recognised by some Kuwait visitors. Circumstantial evidence regarding the movements of the pirates about this time pointed to their having committed this outrage also and Shaikh Mubarak was much excited when the news reached him. The Resident made representations on the subject to the Darya Begi and as they produced no result communicated with His Majesty's Minister and informed him of what had happened. About the same time the Senior Naval Officer was asked to take H. M. S. ' Sphinx ' to Daiyir to make enquiries as to the precise habitat of the gang, but neither course bore fruit. Meanwhile the Shaikh of Kuwait addressed the Residency urging that, if the British authorities were not prepared to arrange for the extermination of this notorious family themselves they should permit him to send out an armed dhow for the purpose, and generally for the protection of Kuwait craft at sea at the head of the Gulf. For several reasons Government considered that this proposal must be negatived : at the same time they held that it was incumbent upon them to see that other steps were taken to deal with the gang, and decided that the Persian Government should be informed that, failing compliance with our reasonable demands. His Majesty's Government would instruct their own ships to do g2the necessary. There being no result from this communication H. M. S. ' Highflyer,' Captain C. H. Hickley, was sent up from Bombay at the end of November to endeavour to capture the pirates at sea- In order to co operate with the naval authorities the Resident proceeded in H. M. S. ' Sphinx ' to join Captain Hickley on the ' Highflyer ' at Henjam, and reliable information having been obtained through the Residency Agent at Lingah, the latter was sent in a native boat to Daiyir to obtain fresh informa tion of the pirates' whereabouts and the services of persons who could re cognise them if met with. It appeared from the Agent's enquiries, very skilfully carried out, that the pirates had just migrated with their families to the jurisdiction of Bandar Rig north of Bushire, the Khan of which place, as a condition of their remaining, having taken a pledge from them that they would conduct themselves as peaceable members of the community. His concurrence secured the outlaws Ganaweh as their place of abode, a hamlet 10 miles north of Bandar Rig, where they had been seen a few days before by one of our informers. H. M. S. ' Highflyer ' and ' Sphinx ' there upon proceeded to Bandar Rig. On the way thither Captain Hickley, Com mander Litchfield and the Resident conferred as to the best line of action to be adopted. Owing to the waters of the coast an question being extremely shoal it was decided that the only chance of capturing the pirates was through the co-operation of the Khan of Bandar Rig, which could best be induced by a threat of the immediate bombardment of his fort if he did not forthwith 'hand the pirates over or assist us in their capture. Bandar Rig being on the telegraph line it was anticipated that on our making any demand on him the Khan would attempt to gain time in order to telegraph for instructions from Bushire, but the solemn threats of the Naval Commanders had the desired effect and the Khan was sufficiently over awed to arrange with Captain Hickley that he himself would ride off to Ganaweh immediately and endeavour to capture the brothers and that if successful he would hoist a flag on the fortlet of the village on which signal H. M. S. ' Highflyer ' and ' Sphinx ' were to close upon Ganaweh and land a party to take over the prisoners. The Khan being made to understand thoroughly that by co-operation he would earn the good will of the Britisn authorities while any duplicity on his part would be rewarded with imme diate retribution fortunately rose to the occasion and the plan succeeded admirably. His passage along the coast to Ganaweh was watched with much interest from the ships in the offing, and in due course a red flag appeared over the Ganaweh fort. An hour or so later a landing was effected by an armed party from the ships including their Commanders and the Resident, and it was found that the Khan had succeeded in capturing two of the brothers 'Abdullah and Adhibi, alias Ibrahim. The third brother 'Abdul Riza had unfortunately not been in his house when the Khan and his men arrived and, hearing that two of his brothers had been arrested had dis appeared inland. As it was just getting dusk at the time he was able to get -clear away. Their dhow, however, which was lying in the creek preparing for sea was seized and taken to Bushire together with the pirates themselves. Having got the men it remained to be decided what was to be done with them. The Resident was strongly of opinion that if they were handed over to the Bushire authorities for trial there was great risk of their being allowed to escape, or a failure of justice in the corrupt Persian tribunals, and as the sons of Humaidi were originally Muhaisin Arabs, and subjects of the Shaikh of Mohammerab, who had himself had one of the family in prison for some years and had expelled the others from his territory for piratical conduct in the Shatt-al-'Arab, permission was asked to hand his captive subjects over to him to be dealt with. Sanction of this course having been accorded, with the concurrence of the Persian Government the pirates were taken to Mohammerah in H. M. S. ' Sphinx.' En route thither His Majesty's ship upon which the Resident travelled called at Kuwait and the pirates were confronted with Shaikh Mubarak, who, as also his subjects, knew them well, they having lived for a time in Kuwait and having been ex celled for their evil reputation. The Shaikh of Mohammerah who was45 fully familiar with their career of crime felt it impossible to resort to public. execution for fear of arousing the hostility of the Muhaisin tribe, but ex pressed his intention of imprisoning them for life. There the matter ended. This gang of pirates was so well known all over the Gulf that their capture had almost beneficial effect upon public opinion, and the incident became the chief topic of conversation in the coffee shops of the Gulf ports for some time afterwards. During 1909, two piracies occurred on the bar and one on the high seas, all committed by Arabs under Turkish or Persian jurisdiction. On 13th February, a Persian vessel owned by Kal Muhammad bin 'Abdul Hasan, Bushiri, was pirated between Qasbat-al-Nassar and the Bar. Pirates said to be adherents of Bukhakh, who lives on Bahmanshir. They were not discovered. A second piracy took place at the same spot on the 7th March, the victim being a boat belonging to Saiyid Hasan bin Saiyid Husain of Bandar Rig. Some 10,000 Krans in cash and property was stolen, the boat's gig was broken up and it was intended also to sink the boat, but some of the pirates objected to this. The matter was reported to Hajl Sultan and after enquiry a boat belonging to Jabir bin Mu'alla, an ^-Shaikh of Qasbat-al-Nassar, was seized. Shaikh Mubarak was asked by Shaikh Khaz'al to hand over three persons suspected of complicity in the piracy, including Jabir bin Mu'alla. This was done but Shaikh Mubarak subsequently asked for the release of two of them on the ground that he had certain information that they were guiltless : they were accordingly released. A list of the names of the pirates was obtained by Haji Sultan, and it appeared therefrom that they were all in habitants of Ma'amir of Dorah on the Turkish side of the river. A third piracy on Kuwait boat on the open seas off Ras-al-Ijlaiah (Kaliyah) took place on 28th June. Some R6,000 to 5)7,000 in cash and goods were stolen, all on board murdered and the boat scuttled. Shaikh Mubarak ascertained that all the pirates were subjects of Shaikh Khaz'al, resident on the Turkish bank of the Shatt-al-'Arab at Duwasir. One of them, by name, Salih, was subsequently caught at Qasbat-al-Nassar and imprisoned by the Shaikh. The remainder whose names are, however, known are still at large. A request by Shaikh Khaz'al for their arrest was refused by the Wall, Sulaiman Nazlf Bey, and Shaikh Mubarak himself did not feel able to ask the Wali to surrender them in view of the political discussion that such a request would inevitably involve. Up to the end of 1910 no progress had been made with this case.46 CHAPTER VIII. The Turko-Persian Frontier question as far as it affects 'Arabistan from 1842 to 1910, with a note on the turko-persian frontier of the pusht-i-kuh district. The relations of the Ka'ab tribe with the Turkish Government and the Ottoman pretensions to sovereignty over the Island of 'Abbadan, the Bah- manshir river and even over the tract of Qubban, have been referred to in Chapter I of this compilation (1635—1800). The narrative will now be resumed from the year 1842 when the Turko-Persian Frontier question was raised for the first time as an international issue affecting both Russia and Great Britain. 1 In consequence of a series of frontier incidents and other disputes extending over a period of ten years, relation between Turkey and Persia became increasingly strained until finally in the summer of 1842 when an unexpected attack was made by the Turkish authorities of Sulaimaniyeh agajnst the summer camp of the Wali of Ardilan, preparations were made for war and a rupture appeared imminent. When the attack on Ardilan became known the Persian Government addressed communications to Sir Stratford Canning and to the Russian Ambassador at Constantinople calling attention to the incident and request ing their friendly intervention with the Porte. The British and Russian Representatives at Constantinople had antici pated the instructions of their Governments by counselling moderation but for a considerable time the prospects of peace were not hopeful and troops continued to be massed on both sides of the frontier. The Ottoman Government were at first indisposed to admit foreign interference but it was eventually agreed that there should be a simultaneous withdrawal of troops, and British and- Russian Agents were sent to each camp to hasten this. After much discussion it was agreed that Joint Commission of the Plenipotentiaries of the two Mussalman Powers should, in concert with British and Russian Delegates, be convened at Erzeroum to investigate and if possible to compromise the rival claims. It was also understood though not formally embodied in a written agree ment that the status quo in the meanwhile should be preserved on the frontier. This is frequently referred to in the correspondence as the ' status quo ' of 1843. The principal of the ' status quo ' was formally confirmed and placed on record in a temporary agreement concluded in 1869 which is stfill theoreti cally in force. 2 The first conference o'f the Commission was in 1843. The British Com missioner was Colonel Williams who afterwards rose to distinction as the defender of Kars. 3 Among the most formidable obstacles to a settlement was the claim on the side of the Porte to the town of Mohammerah which the Persians, sup ported by Russia, stoutly resisted. It is needless to revert in detail to the discussions in which the Joint Com mission became engaged. After four years' negotiation their labours were crowned by the signature of the Preliminary Treaty of Erzeroum 4 1847. But the settlement was only in semblance as, before consenting to the conclusion even of the Preliminary Treaty, the Porte required that assurances should be 1 In the preparation of this Chapter Mr. Alwyn Parker's Memorandum of 8th December 1906 on the Turko-Persian boundary question has been freely utilised as well as his subsequent Memorandum of 15th September 1910. 2 Vide Aitchison's Treaties, Vol. XII, 4th Edition, App. 19. 3 Afterwards Major-General Sir William Fenwick Williams of Kars, R.A., K.C.B. 4 Vide Aitchison's Treaties, Vol. 12, 4th Edition, App. 18.47 given to it as to the meaning of some of the articles and maHe conformity with its view on the part of Persia indispensable to its acceptance of the proposed engagement. After protracted negotiations it was arranged that the desired assurances should be given in writing by the representatives of the two mediating Governments at Constantinople: the Porte, however, insisted that the assurances should be accepted by the Persian Government (who had not been apprised of them) : with this proviso the Treaty was signed. The assurances in question, however, did not meet with the subsequent concurrence of the Persian Government which fearing some covert objection insisted on withholding its consent. It was only after extreme pressure on the part of the mediating Ambassadors that the Persian Plenipotentiary, still protesting want of authority from his Government, acceded to the demands of the Turks. It was with the greatest difficulty and ostensibly as a matter of favour to the British Government, that the Porte expressed itself satisfied with this issue : nor did it then consent to ratify the Treaty without requiring and obtaining from the Representatives of the mediating Governments an ' Ex planatory Note ' embodying in a more formal manner the assurances they had previously given. This was the Treaty ratified at Constantinople in March 1848. 1 The effects of these transactions were to render the work of delimitation impossible and after more than two years wasted in barren discussions, to restrict the labours of the Frontier Commission (composed of Turkish, Persian, British and Russian Delegates) which was now appointed to the mere acquisition of topographical and statistical information. In order to appreciate the extent to which the ' Explanatory Note ' affected the terms of the Treaty and the conflict of pretensions which ensued, it is necessary to contrast the provisions of either instrument, in so far as they relate to frontier claims and particularly to those of 'Arabistan. Treaty of 1848 {Extract) {Translation). Article 2. —The Ottoman Government engages iormally that the Persian Govern ment shall enjoy full sovereignty over the town and port (echelle) of Mohammerah, the Island of Khidhar, the place of anchorage and also the district on the eastern, that is to say the left, bank of the Shatt-al-'Arab, which are in possession of tribes recognised as owing allegiance to Persia. 2 Besides this Persian vessels shall have ful'l right to navigate on the Shatt-al-'Arab from the place where this river throws itself into the sea to the point of contact of the frontiers of the two parties. Article 8. —The two high Mnssalman Powers undertake to adopt and to put into execution the measures necessary in order to prevent and suppress the robberies and acts of brigandage of the tribes and other peoples established on the frontiers to which end they will place troops at suitable spots. And they undertake to acquit themselves of their duty as regards every kind of act of aggression, such as pillage, depredation or murder, which may take place in their respective territories. The two high Powers will leave once for all to the free will of the tribes in regard to whom their Suzerain being unknown, there is a dispute, the right to choose and designate the places where they will henceforward always reside: and it is agreed that tribes whose dependencies is known will be forced to return to the State to which they owe allegiance.

As regards drafting (redaction) of another part of tlie same article concerning tribes genuinely dependant on Persia but who might be divided, one half finding them selves established on Ottoman and the other half on Persian territories, the Sublime Porte enquires whether the part which finds itself in Turkey becomes also subject to Persia and in consequence the territories which it possesses abandoned to Persia and whether Persia could ever at any time dispute with the Porte the possession of such terri tories. In reply to these questions the representatives of the mediating Powers declared as follows :— That the anchorage of Mohammerah is the place situated opposite to the town of that name in the Hafiar Canal, and that the definition is not susceptible of any other interpretation. They adhere in addition to the opinion of the Ottoman Minister, that in abandon ing to Persia in the places referred to the town, port and an anchorage of Mohammerah, as well as the island of Khidhar, the Sublime Porte does not cede in the same places any other lands nor other ports which may exist there. In reply to the second query :— That under no pretext whatever will Persia be able to lay claim to territories situated on the right bank of the river, nor to the territories to the left bank which belong to Turkey, even though Persian tribes should be established partly or wholly on the said bank or in the said territories. ' TITOW.' ' COWLEY.' The explanatory Note has obviously no bearing upon the ancient treaties, nor upon the territorial claims of the Porte except so far as Mohammerah and the adjoining district are concerned. Yet the Porte, foisting upon this document some arbitrary or fanciful explanation has continually based upon the explanatory note its claims to revert to ancient treaties and to fix the boundary according to local tradition, not only at Mohammerah, but apparently also elsewhere. i After considerable delay the Commissioners were at length united at Mohammerah, to commence operations in January 1850. 1 Colonel Williams was again appointed British Commissioner and Lieutenant Glascott, R.N., British Surveyor. The Ottoman Commissioner at the outset proceeded to allege proofs of ancient Ottoman suzerainty over the tribes in possession near Mohammerah, 2 and recorded his claim to all the country included within the yellow line with the exception only of the walled town of Mohammerah and the Island of Khidhar, exclusive of the Island of Mahallah. As an offset to these exorbitant demands, the Persian Commissioner put in his claim, as indicated by a green line on the map 3 on the ground that the country so defined was actually coupled and had been occupied for untold years by Persian tribes. He too, he said, would adduce rebutting evidence of ancient Persian suzerainty of a weight and character altogether superior to the proofs alleged by the rival Commissioners, but all such arguments, he maintained, had been finally disposed of at Erzeroum. He relied solely on the plain wording of the Treaty to justify his claim and appealing to the mediating Commissioners insisted upon actual possession as the principle which should rule generally the division of co-limitary lands. The decision of the mediating Commissioners in regard to these con flicting claims was as follows :— Translation. In order to settle this question it is necessary that we should bear in mind the real object of the Treaty, which was to render Mohammerah a place of commerce and to ensure the passage of boats on the Karun coming from the interior of the country. How were we to attain this object? If any place or possession east of Mohammerah were to remain in possession of the Turkish Government this town would become like a colony or island in the middle of Persian territory which would be contrary to the real object of the Treaty. For thi« 1 For an account of this period vide ' Chaldea and Susiana.' W. K.

As the port where this fort is placed commands navigation towards Basrah 1 we think it right that this place as also the territories to the north of the said canal should remain to Turkey, for just as the possession of Mohammerah and the mouth of the arun should be ensured to Persia, it is likely to ensure to Turkey the navigation of the bhatt-al-'Arab towards Basrah. Taking the opening of the canal into the Shatt-al-'Arab as the line of departure of the frontier line we will defer detailing the sinuosities and the prolongation of this ^ . e direction of Hawizeh until our engineers have made their investigation of this line in the abovementioned spots. In forwarding the handsketch (Appendix B of Mr. Alwyn Parker's Memorandum) appended to this compilation to Sir Stratford Canning, His Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople, under his despatch. No. 3 of 4th rebruary 1850, Colonel Williams wrote :— Beginning from the mouths of the Shatt-al-'Arab the proposed line runs along the western bank of the island of Khidhar, crosses the mouth of Haffilr canal and then up to the bhatt-al- Arab to the mouth of the Abu Jidfyeh canal, a distance of a geographi cal league from the Haftar, and there in a line as straight as circumstances will admit oi^to the town and district of Hawizeh passing through the town named by Darvish Pcshu. Thus we offer to Persia a free entrance to and security in the port of Moham merah at the same time reserving to Turkey the navigation of the Shatt-al-'Arab bv the destruction of a fort built by Shaikh Jabir during the conference of Erzeroum. His Majesty's Government pronounced in favour of the line selected by the mediating Commissioners. By this decision the .debateable lands were pretty evenly divided between the litigants and the security of Basrah and Mohammerah was insured both politically and commercially to their respec tive States. Meanwhile the Persian Government while disposed to forego their own pretensions, maintained that the line proposed by the mediating Commis sioners ought to be drawn at a place four to six miles to the west of Failiyeh, near a place called Tamar, 2 the argument being that a portion of the Ka'ab tribe was in actual possession of the land up to the above spot, if not bevond 1 Colonel Sheil (His Majesty's Minister at Tehran) considered that while tee arguments of the Persian Government were well founded in the main, the advantage and justice of the decision of the mediating Commissioners was so obvious, that he had no hesitation in pressing its acceptance on the Persian Government, who eventually accepted the delimitation of the frontier according to the views of the mediating Commissioners- There is thus no doubt whatever as to the geographical position of the boundary line as laid down by the mediating Commissioners, concurred in by the British and Russian Governments and accepted by the Persian Gov ernment and had it been accepted by the Turkish Government it would in all probability have been adopted in practice. But this was not to be. The Ottoman Commissioner not only rejected the decision of the Com missioners and declined to abate one iota of his pretensions, he further com plicated the issue by demands of an exorbitant character, involving imme diate satisfaction and a change in the status quo and by intrigues among the tribes which led in due course to serious disturbances. At Constantinople the efforts of the Ambassadors to induce the Porte to accept the line recommended by the mediating Commissioners remained without effect. . The Porte persisted in its interpretation of the ' Explanatory Note' as justifying the line laid down by its Commissioner. The actual ' status quo ' at Mohammerah^was ultimately provisionally accepted by the Ottoman and Persian Commissioners under assurances in writing conveyed by each to the mediating Commissioners, to leave aside past reclamations and to renounce any change or innovation in respect to 1 There was a question of the palace at Pailiyeh heing demolished, but it appears that the fortifications alone were razed, an indispensable measure in the opinion of the mediating Commissioners. 2 This place cannot now be identified.50 the troops or employes in the territories in dispute or in respect to the condi tion of the inhabitants. 1 When this understanding was reached in November 1851, it was mutually agreed that the Commissioners should resume their work at the north point of Province of Zuhab, and make the necessary surveys and investigations from that point as far as Hawizeh. In its operation this understanding merely had the effect of transferring to Zuhab the scenes which had been enacted at Mohammerah and of raising there difficulties attended with similar incidents and intrigues on the part of the Ottoman Commissioner. Colonel Williams and his colleague after laborious surveys of this pro vince prepared a map indicating the line which, in their opinion, the frontier should follow. This was communicated to the Mussalman Commissioners together with &amp; memorandum setting forth the logical considerations upon which their decisions were based. Early in 1852, the Ottoman Commissioner declined to proceed further until the Persian Government had re-established the status quo as under stood by the Porte, at Mohammerah and Zuhab. The three other Commis sioners therefore determined, as the only alternative to an indefinite sus pension o-f their labours, to survey the country comprising the line of frontier between Mandali and Hawizeh, The only issue from the deadlock which now supervened consisted, in the opinion of the two mediating Ambassadors at Constantinople, in substi tuting arbitration for mediation as a means of settlement, but this was peremptorily and persistently rejected by the Porte. The only resource that then remained for adoption was to restrict the labours of the Commission to the construction of a map, comprising a zone of country from 20 to 50 miles broad, within whose limits the common frontier would have to be subsequently traced. This course was by mutual consent adopted. In 1852, Colonel Williams reported to His Majesty's Government the conclusion of the survey of the Turko-Persian frontier from the Persian ^ Mount Ararat, but it was not until 1865 that the maps were com- pieted! On examination, moreover, the Russian and English maps proved so inaccurate that the respective Ambassadors at Constantinople refused to isign them. The work of revision lasted till 1869. Colonel Williams' notes and memoranda upon every part of the frontier were lost in their passage up river to Woolwich. r &amp; r j™P° rtaIlt t0 em Phasize the effect of this loss. In a despatch of lo50' Eord Palmerston had laid down that territorial restitution should be confined to Mohammerah, Zuhab and Sulaimaniyeh, in accordance with the Ireaty ot 1847, but that otherwise the status quo should be maintained. It is now, however, impossible to determine what, in the opinion of the mediat ing Commissioners, constituted the status quo of 1843.. The only parts of the frontier actually delimited were Mohammerah to Hawizeh and the province of Zuhab. } V1 ^ n ma P frontier was ready for communica tion to the Turkish and Persian Governments, copies of it were presented to each party with an expression of the expectation of the mediating Powers that the line of boundary was to be found within the limits traced on the map and that the Ottoman and Persian Governments would themselves mark out that line but that, in the event of any difficulty arising between them m regard to any particular locality, the points in dispute should be referred to Great Britain and Eussia. 3 f ^ um ue + T, Fr ? 1 i n d lfficul . ties arising from frontier incidents gained rather than diminished in intensity, a new element of discord having been « f tuch evidence as exists was upheld by the latter Commission which met in 1876. appears trom51 introduced by a Convention 1 which was concluded in August 1869 by which Turkey and Persia undertook thajt, pending settlement of the disputed boundary, the status quo should be maintained and no new buildings should be erected upon the debateable territory. The status quo therein prescribed being differently appreciated by either litigant proved to be a varying quantity of which each side endeavoured to appropriate the larger share. These disputes, however, do not appear to have affected the 'Arabistan portion of the frontier, in regard to which the arrangement come to {vide swpra) between the Turkish and Persian Commissioners for the maintenance of the status quo was respected. It would serve no useful purpose to detail here the prolonged and fruit less negotiations extending from 1870 to the present day in regard to the boundary line : it is sufficient to say that no boundary has yet been fixed by the Persian and Turkish Governments, although in 1875 the Porte formally recognised the zone referred to above as embodying the limits in which the maps should be traced; this admission, it was added, would ipso facto lapse if the Commission then fitting did not arrive at a definite settlement of the frontier question. It is stated by Mr. McDouall on the authority of Mirza Hamza, a confidential agent of Shaikh Khaz'al, that about in 1880 a dispute occurred as to the ownership of the gypsum which is found from Diaji to Manduwan and that the present border was then fixed by representatives of the Basrah and Mohammerah authorities allocating the gypsum to Persia. It was not until 1893 that the question of the 'Arabistan boundary was again raised. 2 In November of that year the Persian Government complained that the Ottoman authorities in defiance of Article II of the Treaty of Erzeroum, were levying customs in the Shatt-al-'Arab on goods going from or to Mohammerah, and that the Governor of Basrah had been instructed that he was to regard Mohammerah and the left bank of the Shatt-al-'Arab as Turkish territory. A strong protest was made to the Porte by His Ma jesty's Government in regard to the action of the Ottoman authorities which it was held might seriously affect British trade on the Karun. The Russian Ambassador at Constantinople treated as ridiculous the Turkish claim to the left bank of the Shatt-al-'Arab. On the 18th November 1895, His Majesty's Ambassador reported that he considered the question of Mohammerah as settled, the Minister for Foreign Affairs having informed him that the Turkish Government laid no claim whatever to the place. In November 1893, the Turkish Government informed the Persian Am bassador that ' they had written to the Customs Agent at Basrah that Mohammerah was a Persian possession and that imports to it were not to be taxed.' In 1896-97, the Turkish Government claimed the right to impose quarantine restrictions on, and search all vessels entering, the Shatt-al-'Arab at Fao. That quarantine and necessary searches should be carried out at Basrah. It was tacitly admitted that British ships were entitled to proceed direct to Mohammerah. In consideration of the concession by the Turks our demand for the recognition of a Consular Agent at Fao was withdrawn. The agreement on the subject between the British and Turkish Govern ment is recorded in the following Notes :— Enclosure in despatch No. 170, Ambassador, Constantinople, to Foreign Office, dated 15th March 1897. Note Verbale, No. 106, Sublime Porte, dated 20tli December 1896.

The English translation is faulty and should he ignored. 2 Early in 1892, the Turkish authorities at Basrah had proposed to establish a quarantine station at Fao, to prevent the evasion by travellers for Basrah of quarantine fees by landing at Mohammerah and proceeding by land or river. The proposal was opposed by the British and Eussian delegates on the Board of Health at Constantinople and was eventually dropped.52 Affaires Etrangeres a I'honneur de Tinformer sur une communication de son Altesse le Grand Vazir que les Autorites Imperiales du Vilayet de Basrah out regu I'orde d'effectuer desormais a Basrah meme les perquisitions qu'elles se trouvent dans le cas de faire a bord des navires anglais naviguant sur le Shatt-al-'Arab. Note Yerbale, No. 148, dated 2nd December 1896 (thus in original). ' His Majesty's Embassy have the honour to acknowledge receipt of the Sublime Porte's Note Verbale No. 104 of December 20th (sic) stating that (vide supra) *#=*##=*_ jjjg Majesty's Embassy take note of this communication, but it is well understood that British ships enjoy perfect liberty to proceed direct to Mohammerah or any other portion of Persian territory and cannot be compelled under any pretext to stop at Fao on their way thither or to Basrah unless they themselves desire it.' No reply was received to the latter Note, and it may therefore be inferred that the claim made therein was admitted. In April 1899, the Basrah authorities were making an embankment on the Diaji border which were extended across the frontier. On a personal protest by the Shaikh of Mohammerah's deputy they withdrew and since then there have been no disputes as to the border. The islands of Aqawat and Barln were formerly said to be under dispute but are now recognised by the Shaikh as Turkish territory. In the autumn of 1907, there seemed some possibility of Turkish aggres sion in the neighbourhood of Mohammerah, and Sir N. O'Conor, then His Majesty s Ambassador at Constantinople, was informed on 25th February 1908, that as regards the district in the neighbourhood of Mohammerah, His Majesty's Government were not prepared to recognise any other frontier than that laid down by the mediating Commissioners in 1850. Any disturb ance of the status quo at Mohammerah would affect British interests, and might not improbably lead to the active intervention of His Majesty's Gov ernment who have given the Shaikh certain assurances in regard to his terri tory.' This pronouncement was not, however, communicated to the Turkish Government, nor to the Shaikh, the latter being simply informed that we were fully alive to the situation, and did rot anticipate Turkish aggression in the neighbourhood of Mohammerah. 1 he Shaikh's fears, however, were not realised, but the inaction of the Persian Government, who left the Shaikh entirely in the dark in regard to what was passing, gave him no instructions as to what course he should pursue in the event of hostilities breaking out, and failed to provide him with guns or munitions of war, was considered by the Political Resident in the Persian- Gulf to provide us with a useful argu ment in future in support of the preservation of his semi-independent and tribal position. In the following year the Resident took advantage of the presence of an officer with two surveyors to cause the Shatt-al-'Arab and Bahmanshlr rivers to be surveyed on the scale lm= 1'. In the course of this survey the actual position of the locally recognised frontier beyond Failiyeh was as certained and accurately delimited. It was then seen that it differed widely from that laid down by the mediating Commissioners in 1850 and that, were the Turks to insist on being put in possession of the territory allocated to them by the mediating Commissioners in 1850, Persia would lose a strip of land over 6 miles broad, from Diaji to Failiyeh, and the Shaikh would find not only his palace, (which had been completed in 1907) but also his other residence and offices and prison at Failiyeh and between Diaii and Khaiym, in Turkish territory. Such an alteration in the status quo existing as far as evidence is available, since 1843, could scarcely fail to be very pre judicial to British interests, and failure to support the Shaikh .in opposition to it would be misunderstood by him. Moreover, whereas the centre of the practice for many years past, the Commissioners' line gives the Porte the whole channel, including the islands of Muhalleh and the Dawasir.53 As, however, the Turkish Government were said to be in possession of a copy of the map 1 of the mediating Commissioners of 1850, His Majesty's Government, in reply to a reference on the subject from the Resident to His Majesty's Minister, decided that it was necessary to adhere to the line of the mediating Commissioners which could only be departed from after con sultation with the Russian Government, and as the result of an agreement with the Turkish Government. His Majesty's Government, however, it was explained in a despatch to the Resident from the Foreign Office, No. 1 ' Poli tical,' dated 27th June 1910, had no desire to disturb the status quo locally observed, and if there were danger of the question being raised, would devote their efforts to the prevention of such a contingency. On August 30th, 1910, in reply to a subsequent reference on this subject from His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires at Tehran, who pointed out that it was unlikely that the Turks would appeal to the recommendation of the mediating Commissioners whose finding they have almost invariably affected to ignore. Sir E- Grey stated on August 30th that ' His Majesty's Govern ment will of course use their best endeavours to prevent the question being raised at all by the Turkish Government, or, if they insist on raising it, to persuade them to desist, but that it would be difficult, while urging them to abide by the decision of the mediating Commissioners as regards the northern portion of the frontier, to insist on their disregarding it, as regards the southern, even granting that they themselves were to adopt an equally illogical attitude in the matter. Should the question, however, be forced on His Majesty's Government, it would of course be open to them to negotiate for the recognition of the locally accepted boundarv, while retaining that of the mediating Commission as the bases of the discussion, and they can with equal justice refuse to tolerate the recognition of anything but the status quo and as regards the southern portion of the boundary, until the Turkish Government admit the line of the mediating Commissioners i'n the north. This, the latest pronouncement of His Majesty's Government on the subject, may be considered satisfactory from the Persian point of view, and it is not too much to hope that in accordance with the principles therein enunciated a settlement satisfactory to the Shaikh and the Persian Govern ment could be reached were the question of Arabistan frontier to be^ raised by the Turks, since there is reason to believe that the present frontier em bodies in effect, the status quo of 1843 to which the Turks attach so much importance, Note on the Turko-Persian Frontier of the Pusht-i-Kuh district? This note, which should be read in conjunction with that relating to 'Arabistan, is intended to explain the frontier question in its special aspect in relation to the Pusht-i-Kuh portion of the boundary. The chief difference between the boundary question of 'Arabistan and that of Pusht-i-Kuh is that in the former case the boundary is settled from the Gulf to Hawizeh by the mediating Commissioners' line of 1850, whereas in the case of Pusht-i-Kuh the boundary line is determined by the Protocol of 1869 between Turkey and Persia. 3 ******* Extract—Translation.—2.

The survey was completed the same year, but it was not until 1869 that the identic map, showing a zone from 20 to 50 miles broad, within which the frontier lay, was handed to the Persian and Russian Governments. Prolonged negotiations ensued as to the manner in which the frontier should best be traced by the two co-limitary Powers. Meanwhile there was no abatement of the frontier incidents, particularly in the Pusht-i-Kuh district: on the con trary, thanks to the Protocol of 1869 referred to above, these differences gained in intensity between 1869 and 1873 as the status quo was differently interpreted by the two parties, and, the mediating Commissioners' notes having been lost, as explained previously, no means existed of ascertaining what the status quo was. In regard to the lands on the Pusht-i-Kuh border known by the Turks as Saipd Hasan and by the Persians as Baksai and Ghuraibeh, which include a portion of the Saifi Malkhata'I lands, an agreement was renewed in 1873 by which it was agreed between Persia and Turkey that the said lands should remain intact and should not be interfered with on either side, and that neither side should claim nor institute any right of possession by cultivation, or otherwise, until the Commission appointed had expressed its opinion. 1 This understanding has only indifferently served its purpose. Many disputes have arisen in regard to the Wall of Pusht-i-Kuh's border at Badara i and in the summer of 1907 an armed force was despatched from Baghdad via Mandali to assert the claims of the Turks to the Saifi Mal- khata'i lands to the east and north-east of Badara/i occupied bv the Wall of Pusht-i-Kuh. N As it happened, the latter was on his way back to his country from Baghdad and he overtook and passed the force at Mandali. It followed on, and marched up to the entrance of the Kunjian Cham valley, and began burn- ing the crop. The Wali at once turned out to meet them and a short but decisive engagement took place, in which the heterogeneous Turkish force was worsted and dispersed. The prisoners were shortly afterwards released. All the Turks' supplies also fell into the Wall's hands. • . The Turks have not again agitated the question of the boundary line in this quarter and the Wall's labours to secure a still stronger title to the land by bringing it under irrigation go on unopposed. The Wall occupies the land and when Captain Lorimer, His Majesty's Consul at Ahwaz, met him in 1908 he was actually camped within the debateable area. Either from its intrinsic value, or the more clearly to demonstrate the effectiveness of his occupation, he had for some time had in hard a big work in the form of a qanat designed to bring the water of the Kunjian Cham on the disputed terri tory. On this work he is said to have spent in 1907 some 6,000 Tomans. Work was still in progress in 1908 and much remains to be done. It is said to be represented by the Turks that the Wall is trying to divert the entire river on which Zorbatiyeh and Badara'I depend for their assistance. The falseness of this charge is apparent to any observer on the spot. Such an undertaking lies outside the scope of the scheme which is being carried out, and probably of any which the Wall has the means of undertaking. In regard to the rival claims of Turkey and Persia in the matter of the Pusht-i-Kuh frontier, it seems that the Turks claim that the boundary lies within the outer range of hills at the point where these are pierced by the Ab-i-Kunjian Cham, and that the plain which extends from the foot of these hills, to at least as far east as the Gawl, and southwards to a low ridce which bounds it on the south, is Turkish territory. The Wall repudiates these claims and it would seem unreasonable that Arabian 'Iraq should include any territory lying within the general line of the hills- this a^eemenV ' ^ &gt;er8 ^ an ■*- rea ^ es '' 1896, p. 218. Mr. Alwyn Parker's memorandum makes no mention of55 CHAPTEH IX. The Relations of the Shaikh of Mohammerah with the Turks. From the foregoing narrative of the Turko-Persian frontier it will be apparent that whilst along other parts of the frontier, in the words of Mr. Parker's memorandum ' the whole weight of tradition and documentary proof goes to show that Persia and not Turkey is the aggrieved party,' in 'Arabistan the Persian Government has at no time had serious reason to complain of Turkish aggression and has for the last 50 years enjoyed a locally recognized boundary line more favourable than that defined by the mediating Commissioners and practically identical with that claimed by the Persian Commissioners. Hawlzeh, moreover, which has always been Persian, remains so 1 together with the country in its vicinity to the westwards, though the mediating Commissioners' line bisects the town. This state of things is due partly to Turkish military and administra tive weakness along this frontier, partly to the fact that the tribes on either side of the boreder are of the same religion, though the Turks themselves are Sunnis, and partly to the wise policy adopted by successive Shaikhs of Mohammerah in their relations with the Turks. The last-named factor forms the subject of the present Chapter. The relations of the representatives of the Persian and Turkish Govern ments here, as elsewhere along the frontier, are nominally governed by the provisions of the Treaty of Erzeroum, 1848, the Protocol of 1869 and the Convention of 1875. 2 By the Treaty of 3 1746 between Turkey and Persia, extradition of fugi tives is mutually compulsory on both Powers. Extract—Translation. —If after the date of the present Treaty any of the subjects of the two Courts should take refuge in the respective States no protection will be accorded to such fugitives, on the contrary they will be handed over on demand to the Charge d'Affaires concerned. By the Treaty of 1823 between Turkey and Persia (confirmed in 1847) non-interference in the internal affairs of either State is enjoined and if frontier tribes of either side pass the boundary customary tribute must be paid. Extract—Translation. —1. The two High Powers do not admit each others inter ference in the internal affairs of their respective States.

In conformity with ancient engagements, the deserters from either country shall not be received; and in like manner, from this period, the wandering tribes and others quitting Persia for Turkey, or Turkey for Persia shall not receive protection from either party.

In regard to the sup pression of brigandage on the frontiers (Article 8) :— Extract—Translation. —The two High Mussalman Powers undertake to adopt and put into execution the measures necessary in order to prevent and suppress robberies and acts of brigandage of the tribes and other peoples established on the frontiers, to whica end they will place troops at suitable spots.

By the temporary Boundary Agreement of 1869, which is discussed in detail in the preceding chapter, it is provided that disputes in regard to the disputed territory along the frontier must in the first place be discussed be tween frontier authorities and by them referred to their respective Central Governments if they are unable to agree. This provision affords a possible reply to the claim, raised by the Wall of Basrah in 1910, that discussion of frontier disputes should be conducted between himself and the Persian Consul-General at Basrah and not between himself and the Shaikh of Mohammerah. The Convention 1 of 1875 is, however, most important of the instruments regulating the rights and duties of the two Governments in regard to the subjects of each other. It may be considered as in full force at present, and has not been modified by any subsequent enactment, as far as is known, although certain explanations in regard to it are contained in a Turkish Wazirial letter of January 4th, 1876. This letter, not being included in Aitchison's ' Treaties, etc.,' and being of importance, is reproduced as Appendix I to this Volume. Article I of the Convention provides for the trial and punishment of offences committed by the Persian subjects by Ottoman tribunals but with the cognizance of Persian agents unless the misdeed in question took place openly and publicly. 2 n For the execution of sentences relating to commerce or rights, by which Persian subjects may be condemned, recourse is to be had to the intervention oi Persian Agents, but if within the allotted period the said decrees are nut executed in this way the Ottoman officials will execute them directly. Persian subjects may enter trade guilds, but shall be subject to all regu lations, customs and laws in the same way as Ottoman tradesmen, and in commercial matters will be individually subject to Ottoman tribunals and officials. Persian subjects are exempt from military service. Suits of every kind between Persians shall be settled by the Persian Consular Courts, though such delinquents may be arrested by the Ottoman police and detained pending communication with the Persian Agencies, to whom they shall be delivered on demand. In regard to the naturalisation of Persians as Ottoman subjects, it must conform to the special rule observed in regard to other foreign subjects, and to the special regulations on the subject, which were communicated in 1868 to all Embassies. Unless these formalities are complied with no one Persian subject is to be received as an Ottoman subject. 'This clause like the others to be conoitional on reciprocity on the part of Persia.

Not less than 75,000 Arabs on the Turkish bank of the Shatt-al-'Arab are of the Ka'ab or the Muhaisin tribes, originally Per sian, and in many cases quite recent arrivals from the Persian side. They number nearly half the total riverain population, and whilst they have at no time caused the Turkish Government serious anxiety, the Shaikhs of Mohammerah never having attempted to raise the tribes under their in fluence against the Turkish Government, the Turks, particularly in recent years, have come to resent the great influence wielded in their territory by the Shaikh of Mohammerah and have therefore steadily attempted to induce all Arabs living in Turkish territory to take out Turkish certificates of nationality, as a condition precedent to recognition of their rights in the Turkish Courts of Law. They have even gone so far as to tell Arabs that unless they take out Turkish^ certificates of nationality they will be refused any kind of redress for wrongs, and will be forced to leave their date groves, but they have so far taken no active steps to enforce these threats. It is, of course, possible to argue the legality of this course under the provisions of the second half of Article 8 of the Treaty of Erzeroum, quoted above, but the fact that it has, as far as the Shatt-al-'Arab frontier is con cerned, remained a dead-letter to this day should be sufficient in itself to refute such a contention. It may moreover be held that the second of the questions 1 raised by the Turks previous to ratifying the Treaty of Erzeroum and reproduced in the ' Explanatory Note 2 ' {vide previous Chapter) shows that the Turkish Gov ernment contemplated without demur the possibility of tribes genuinely de pendent on Persia finding themselves partly established in Ottoman territory, and it will be noted that, the mediating Commissioners gave no reply to the question of the Porte as to whether that part of a genuine Persian tribe which finds itself in Turkey becomes subject to Persia; they dealt only with the territorial question raised. The position of the Shaikh vis a vis the Arab tribes dependent on Persia but resident in Turkey presents many anomalies, but has the sanction of usage and ancient custom. The members of such tribes are liable to military service and the Shaikh has not infrequently called them up for operations against the Bani Turuf and other recalcitrant tribes ; the obliga tion is doubtless distasteful to the tribesmen, but the right of the Shaikh to demand it has never been disputed by them, and important landowners, Turkish subjects, such as the Naqib's family, Ahmad Efiendi, Saiyid Talib, and others have, in virtue of engagements dating from the time of Shaikh Haji Jabir, personally made themselves responsible for the collection and despatch of levies, a proceeding naturally very distasteful to the Turks. 3 In tribal matters, the jurisdiction of the Shaikh is unquestioned by such tribesmen and in cases of blood feuds, as in other questions in which tribal law prevails, his intervention is necessary to efiect a settlement, the idea of taking such cases to a Turkish Court of Law being wholly foreign to Arab ideas. This, again, is galling to Turkish susceptibilities. 1 Question of the Turkish Government:—' As regards the drafting (redaction) ot another part of the same article (2) concerning tribes genuinely dependent on Persia, but who might be divided, one half finding them selves on Ottoman and the other half on Persian territory, the Sublime Porte enquires whether the part of the tribe which finds itself in Turkey also becomes subject to Persia, and in consequence, the territories which it possesses abandoned to Persia and whether Persia could at any time dispute with the Porte the posstssion of such territorii-s.' Answer of the Representatives of the mediating Powers :—' That under no pretext whatever will Persia be able to lay claim to territories situated on the right bank of the river, not to belong to Turkey, even though Persian tribes should be established partly or wholly on the said bank or in the said territories.' 2 {Vide Mr. Parker's Memorandum of 6th December 1906 on the Turko-Persian Frontier question.) 3 In 1908 and again in 1910 the Wali of Basrah issued orders to the Turkish officials along the river to forbid all Arabs to proceed to Mohammerah to join the Shaikh's levies, should they be called upon to do so. On the first occasion the protest had no effect, and was not enforced, and on the second occasion, the Shaikh had no need for these levies and did not call them up. But the Wali of Basrah ordered Arabs intending to join his forces on this occasion to be warned that if they did so they would be imprisoned, deprived of their property and rights in their lands, and expelled from Turkey.58 In return, the Shaikh grants to such tribesmen as live in his lands in Turkey, and such men are very numerous, the customary tribal exemptions from grazing taxes ' vergi ' or ' miri ' taxation, and from other imposts of a minor character, but important in the aggregate. Many of them, too, even though actually in possession of Turkish certificates of nationality (which documents are considered by Arabs as purely administra tive documents having no bearing on tribal questions) have the right, handed down from father to son, to cultivate wheat lands in the Ahwaz district, and Arabs of the Kaab and Muhaisin tribes living in Abulkhasib and Zain will be found in December and January ploughing their lands as far north as W £113. We thus have the quaint anomaly of Arab tribesmen, in possession of certificates of Turkish nationality and liable to Turkish military service, training for which they may have actually undergone, acknowledging simul- taneously liability to service under the Persian Flag, and proceeding annually i • ^ ? s an&lt; ^ more from their homes in Turkey to cultivate lands in Persia w Inch they and their forefathers have tilled for generations. Questions of reciprocity seldom arise between Persia and Turkey, in regard to this frontier at all events, in connection with the treatment of Arab, tribes, since no Arab tribes subject to Turkey reside in Persian terri tory, though, as has been shown, the reverse is very extensively the case. The Shaikh as a landowner. The Shaikh of Mohammerah exercises, and it is inevitable and natural tnat he should exercise, influence in Turkish territory in virtue of the fact that he is by far the largest holder of cultivated land in Basrah district. Jno serious estimate of the value of the lands he owns can be attempted, but it has been greatly enhanced in recent years by the general improvement ^ values and half a million sterling is probably not too high a figure, although were his lands to be thrown on the market at present, they would piobably not find a buyer at any thing like this price. Many of the lands he owns were purchased by Shaikh Haji Jabir in the sixties and seventies, when land was cheap, and when the Turkish authorities in Basrah had to depend e\ en more than at present on the good-will of the Shaikh of Mohammerah for the peace and safety of the district. 1 Sir Khaz'al Khan, K.C I.E., has also invested largely in property in the Basrah nilayat during the last ten years. The main reasons which led him and his predecessors to invest their money m Turkey rather than Persia no longer apply with the same force as lormerly and it is probably^ from habit rather than from necessity that the fenaikn has purchased land in Turkey during the last few years. . , ® about 1903, the Shaikh of Mohammerah and his tribes held no title trom the Persian Government to the date groves and other lands occupied by them and they were therefore disinclined to invest money and labour m them as the possibility of dispossession was always before their eyes. The Turks were weak, not less friendly disposed than the Persian Government; it was then desirable in their eyes to have lands in Turkish territory in which they could settle if need arose. When reproved for by the Persian Governors of 'Arabistan for favour- mg this policy, the Shaikh of Mohammerah used to reply that he did so rom patriotic motives and with the strategical object of securing from hostile influences areas of Turkish territory adjacent to that of Persia. The acquisition of lands of Umm-ar-Rassas and Umm -al-Khassasif opposite Mohammerah and Failiyeh, respectively, and of the Diaji lands on the Turko-Persian frontier was used to illustrate this point of view which59 it is doubted whether it has ever been so regarded by the Shaikh. It is certain, however, that the almost complete absence of active frontier dis putes in 'Arabistan and the Shatt-al-'Arab is in no small degree due to the fact that the Shaikh of Mohammerah is the actual owner of all lands in the neighbourhood of the Turko-Persian boundary, and of all islands in the Shatt-al-'Arab which might form objects of dispute. Having thus briefly surveyed of the legal and proprietary relations exist ing between the Shaikh and the Turkish authorities, it remains to give a brief account of the more important phases of the problem which inevitably arises from the complex personal and tribal vested interests described above- The value of Mohammerah as a commercial position was established by Shaikh Thamir-bin-Ghadhban (bin-Ghanini ?) bin-Salman, who opened it as a free port, thereby inflicting serious damage on the revenues of the Turkish Customs at Basrah; hence arose the dispute concerning the place between the Turks and the Persians. 1 'Ali, Pasha of Baghdad, finding his income considerably diminished determined on attacking Thamir and the town taken by treachery was destroyed in 1831. The Persians, being bound to support the Shaikh and to defend Persian soil protested warmly against this action, though it does not appear that they had recourse to actual hostilities. Meanwhile Shaikh Thamir, whose head-quarters were at Fallahiyeh assumed a very independent position, though nominally under the Turks. The custody of Mohammerah was confided to Haji Jabir-bin-Mardao, of the Muhaisin, a tribe at that time subordinate to the Ka'ab. 2 Shaikh Haji Jabir was a shrewd calculating Arab, far beyond his race m intelligence and in civilisation. He is still spoken of by his contemporaries as superior in intelligence to either of his successors. He owned several vessels, carried on an extensive trade with Maskat and Bombay. In this way and by wise investments in land, principally in Turkey, he gradually acquired a large fortune and the influence that money brings. Shaikh Thamir was succeeded by his son, Paris in 1834, but by this time Haji Jabir was practically independent, and when in 1857 the British eva cuated Mohammerah, which they had captured, thev handed it back to Haji Jabir, who from this time forward was independent of the Ka ab though he did not actually make his residence at Mohammerah until the suceeeding year, having lived until then at Diaji. The Turks had therefore to deal hence forward with a clever Shaikh backed by the united Arab forces of Moham merah and Fallahlyah. Prom that time forward Turko-Persian troubles ceased; the weakness of the Turks prevented them from taking aggressive action even had they de sired to do so against Mohammerah, the possession of which had, moreover, been definitely assigned to Persia by the mediating Commissioners in 1850. 3 On the other hand. Shaikh Haji Jabir at no time harboured aggressive designs against Turkey, a proceeding which would have been contrary to his mode rate and pacific policy. He died in 1881, and was succeeded by his son, Miz'al who followed in his father's footsteps for the most part. The Turks were meanwhile growing less complacent and inore aggressive, but a corre sponding increase in Shaikh's forces presented any unpleasant incident. In 1877, the question of the ownership of the island (Shalhah) which had formed within recent years oh the left of Persian bank of the Shatt-al- 'Arab opposite Dawasir was raised by the Turks. They claimed it as Turkish territory. An arrangement was comcto, the details of which are not at present available whereby the Turkish and Persian Governments agreed not to allow it to be cultivated or occupied. The arrangement seems, however, to have been disregarded and in 1883 when Nasir Pasha, Wall of Basrah, again raised the question, it was being cultivated by Arabs of Shaikh Miz'al and was claimed by the latter as Persian territory. 1 Vide ' Chaldeea and Susiana,' 1857. W. K. Loftus, Chapter 22. 2 Shaikh Khaz'al and a few of the Ka'ab Masha'ikh still wear the old fashioned Ka'ab turban, somewhat similar to that of the inhabitants of Shushtar and Dizful. i As early as 1848, if not before, the British Political Agent at Baghdad recognised him as a Persian subject and •omplained of his proceedings to the Shah.60 The latter attempted to avoid discussing the Question by claiming that communications should be addressed to him through the Persian Consul at Basrah, and not direct. As, however, the Wall insisted on raising the ques tion, and announced his intention of taking the island by force, Shaikh Miz al accepted the challenge, collected some thousands of his Arabs on the Persian mainland opposite the island in dispute, and awaited the arrival of the Turks. letters gunboat arrived in due course full of troops, but when the Wall saw the numbers of Arabs collected on the bank, evidently with a view to resisting any attempt to seize the disputed land, he changed his mind and passed down stream to Fao. Next day the gunboat returned and found the Arabs still ready, and engaged as before in vociferous war dances, so he went on to Failiyeh^ where he landed and interviewed Shaikh Miz'al, and asked him the meaning of the massing of his Arabs opposite the island, Ihe bnaikh tried to avoid the issue by saying that they had been sent to catch partridges ahve for the Zill-es-Sultan, but when the Wali insisted on a reply Mizal declared roundly that the island was Persian and should remain so as ong as he had breath in his body : he further asserted that it was so recog- mzed by the Anglo-Russian Commission, but there is no evidence available o this. The Wali seemed to have felt it impolitic to take further action, as he withdrew, and thence forward the island has remained in Persian hands. vu V? on Mi z ' a l' s assassination in 1897, he was succeeded by his brother Khaz al, who devoted all his attention to the cultivation of political relations with the British, and who spared no pains to strengthen his military position concurrently with his political connections. He bought more land in Turkey extended his influence in the town of Basrah where his representative Mirza Hamza (a Turkish subject) enjoyed a reputation as arbitrator in dis putes of all kinds which sometimes quite eclipsed the Turkish Courts of Law, then notorious even amongst Turks for their venality and inefficiency. The importance of the Turks, and the antics of their constantly changing alls, made it difficult for the Shaikh to treat them very seriously, and the accusation levelled against him by Turks, that he got his way by bnbery and corruption of officials has probably a substantial substratum of truth, since this proceeding is necessary in order to get anything done in Turkey, to this day. &amp; j &amp; Another and more serious accusation is that he gave asylum to bad characters and encouraged them to plunder Basrah, himself sharing in their booty. I his accusation likewise contains an element of truth, although ft is m its main outline untrue. The complete incapacity of the Turks to deal with Arab pirates and house-breakers led them to solicit Haji Jabir's inter vention on numerous occasions in dealing with their own subjects, and not inirequently it was arranged that Haj! Jabir should give them a domicile m Mohammerah territory, in order better to supervise their movements. Shaikh Miz'al moreover finding Turkish authorities unable or unwilling to co-operate with him m capturing and imprisoning miscreants, adopted the well-known Oriental method of taking them into his pay as retainers so that they would be always under his eye and being in receipt of a regular salary, would be relieved of the primary temptation to rob. This method which was continued by Shaikh Khaz'al was indubitably effective as far as Mohammerah was concerned, and the capture of such men by the inefficient lurlnsh police, if outlawed, being practically impossible, it was the only one 0 errng any prospeci of success. It had, and still has, the disadvantage that it laid the bhaikh open to the charge of harbouring known criminals and even though the said criminals have probably done nothing more serious than rob, ^ though their acts have not his cognizance or approval, the charge is difficult to meet. 0 Such accusations were brought against Shaikh Khaz'al in 1906 in connec tion with the murder of Mr. Glanville at Ma'gil near Basrah in 1906 but the correspondence on the subject is illustrative rather of the inefficiency and corruption of the Turkish authorities, than of the Shaikh's remissness his reluctance to take active measures to apprehend the men accused by the 1 urkish authorities of complicity in the affair being due to a well-founded61 belief that the men named were wanted by the Turks for reasons other than those alleged. 1 The charge brought against him and his predecessors of having used robberies at Basrah as a means of bringing pressure to bear on the Turkish authorities when the latter were acting in a manner inimical to the interests and to those of his Government, was considered to be well founded by Mr. McDouall 2 but the need for such a drastic remedy will, it is to be hoped, not occur again, although it cannot be said that recent Walls have adopted a conciliatory attitude in their relations with the Shaikh. In proportion as His Majesty's Government, or that of the Shah, are able to bring effective pressure to bear at Constantinople to prevent the Turks from acting in a, manner hostile to the Shaikh's interests, the latter will be able to settle his affairs on the river and the frontier amicably and without resort to the more primitive methods described above. The Kut-i-Zain incident of April 1910, involving as it did the question of the Shaikh's tribal rights, and the nationality of his tribesmen in Turkish territory, was of considerable importance. Lapse of time and a^ renewal of friendly relations between the Shaikh and the then Wall, Sulaiman Nazif Bey, brought the incident to an inconclusive termination, _ and the endorsement recorded by His Majesty's Government to the Shaikh's atti tude of restraint on that occasion should not be allowed to obscure the fact that the questions raised by the Turks have not been settled. These com prised :— (1) The right of tribesmen of the Shaikh, being in Turkish territory, to Persian nationality. (2) The right of the Turkish authorities to demand the extradition and surrender of Persians accused of offences committed in Turkish territory. From the administrative and legal point, however, two important issues were definitely settled in connection with the dispute. (1) His Maiesty's Consul, Basrah, asserted to the Acting Wall on May 5th the right of His Majesty's Government to intervene to protect the Shaikh. 3 . (2) As a result of the incident or, perhaps of this assertion oi our right to intervene, the Council of State declared that, m future no more land in the Basrah district was to be registered in the names of Shaikh Khaz'al or his agent Mirza Hamzah or of the latter's agent Mulla Mustafa. 4 At the close of 1910, His Majesty's Government had not yet decided 5 what communication should be made to the Porte in regard to our right, or rather obligation, to protect the Shaikh of Mohammerah. This fact, however, cannot be unknown to them in view of Mr. Crow's declaration referred to above, and of the fact that in connection with the Faddaghiyah incident in October 1910, when it seemed possible that the Turks might take aggressive measures against Mohammerah, a British gun-boat was despatched without delay to that place. _ . . ., The Faddaghiyah incident, which arose out of the Kut-i-Zain incident, may be briefly described as follows -.—Certain cultivators, Persian subjects, living in Turkish territory at Faddaghiyah had a dispute with the Turkish owners of the land, who were the members of the Mishn family. The latter used their influence to have the said cultivators ejected by the 1 T&gt;ip roiTeswondence on this subiect was forwarded by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to TTis Maiesty 's Legation and the Government of India under his No. 1914-5 of 16th July 1910, and will be found printed in the Proceedings of the Government of India in the Foreign Department. 2 y ide correspondence forwarded by the Political Resident m the Persian Gulf to the Government of _ India nnder his No. 1194 of 15th May 1909, and reproduced in the Proceedings of the Government ot India in tne r0 ' e ^rae P his t Despatch No. 26 of 14th May to H. M.'s Ambassador, Constantinople, reproduced in the Proceed ings of the Government of India in the Foreign Department for May 1910. 4 In consequence of this decision the Shamshamiyah land purchased by the Shaikh in 1909 (v.s.) was refused registration. 5 It was ultimately decided to make no communication.62 Turkish authorities, although it was considered that the cultivators who were tab eh or owners of one quarter of the land and a proportion of the crops, had right on their side. (The passive espousal of their cause hv Muhammad-al-Kanan, a brother-in-law of the Shaikh and tribal chief, was the immediate cause of the bombardment of his house at Kut-i-Zain bv the Turkish gun-boat, and the consequent difficulties between the Shaikh and the i- A, B « 0 re his departure. Sulaiman Nazif Bey, under whose Governor- slup they had been ejected, arranged, it is understood, for their re-instate- ,i U3 sueeessw Jalal Bey, took no steps in the matter.

PART I. I.—The Karun Irrigation Scheme. The Karixn irrigation scheme first came within the sphere of practical politics in July 1904, when, in connection with a loan of £300,000 to the Persian Government, M. Nans, Administrator General of Customs at Tehran, suggested to His Majesty's Minister that of the total sum, £200,000 should be devoted to irrigation works which the Persian Government desired to undertake in the Karun valley. The revenues accruing from these works, and the domains fertilized by them might be pledged as subsidiary security for the additional advance coupled with an undertaking that embargoes on grain from the Karun valley should be henceforward abolished. Sir A. Hardinge desired to encourage the Persian Government to believe that the British Government would assist financially, and thus secure a foot ing in current irrigation projects on the Karun, which were then being advo cated by 'Ain-ud-Dauleh, and with this object in view Van Roggen, a Dutch engineer appointed in 1903 as technical adviser to the Mdnister of Public Works, consequent upon a report on Karun irrigation which had attracted the special attention of H. I. M. the Shah, was given an introduction to His Majesty's Minister at the Hague by Sir A. Hardinge. As soon as the scheme was mooted Lord Gurzon, in a minute dated 1st August 1904^ recorded his opinion that any such scheme, if successfully carried out, would practically destroy the Karun as a navigable river to the detriment of Lynch Brothers' interests, 1 and that we should in no way gain by the scheme were Messrs. Lynch Brothers to be pushed out and to be replaced by Belgian officials and Dutch engineers. If, however, we had a preponderating voice in the control of the scheme, we might replace one form of commercial activity and open up another route for navigation to the plains of 'Arabistan via Khur Musa. He emphasized the supreme importance of British participation and joint control in any Karun irrigation scheme, if it was to be started, and conversely the striking danger to British interests that would result if we were left out of sight in any such enterprise. Lapse of time has tended to confirm the correctness of this statement of opinion, in which the case against the scheme is compressed into a few words. In January 1906, the scheme began to be publicly talked of. Van Roggen and his assistants visited Ahwaz and commenced their investigations. The Shaikh was exercised at the rumours he had heard in connection with it: he had fears for the date groves of the Bahmanshlr rivers—fears which careful investigations have shown to be ill-founded. He pointed out that the land which it was proposed to (irrigate had been cultivated for 150 years by the Bawi tribes, and enquired whether we advised him to come to an arrange ment on the subject with the Persian Government or not. Van Roggen's scheme involved the irrigation of 144 square miles at a cost of £2,000,000 and was based upon most optimistic estimates of crops, etc., which the Shaikh thought absurd. He doubted whether the scheme would be profitable. An officer of the Public Works (Irrigation) Department of the Government of India, Major W. R. Morton, R.E., was despatched from India in January to report on the probability of the scheme. 1 The same view was taken by Messrs. Lynch Brothers in November 1904.J 13 It is of interests to note that at this time the Shaikh was not apparently aware that under his ' farman 51 the land belonged to him and his tribes, for he said to Mr. McDouall in February 1905 that he would like to purchase the land cheap from Government, as at present, though in tribal possession, it was not theirs by title-deed. In April 1905 again he omitted all mention of the ' farman ' when discussing his rights in the matter with Lieutenant Lorimer. Nor was this point noticed by His Majesty's Government, although a copy of the list of requests of His Excellency the Mu'Izz-es-Saltaneh, to gether with the replies of the Persian Government thereto, had been for warded by His Majesty's Legation to the Foreign Office under cover of despatch No. 137 of 8th October 1902. 2 It is important to emphasise the effect of this upon subsequent negotia tions. Had the British Government been aware of the very definite rights of the Shaikh in the matter, it is probable that they would have taken a much stronger line in the matter basing their claiim to intervene on the fact that the farman granting the lands east of the Karun formed an essential part of the compromise between the Shaikh and the Persian Government, whereby the latter were enabled to establish Customs Houses in the territories of the former to which the British Government were a party. 3 By February 1905, Major Morton had come to the conclusion that ' the maintaining of navigation on the Lower Karun is likely to conflict seriously with the success of an irrigation scheme for the Karun at Ahwaz, and that either one or the other should be upheld.' The Karun was, he said, at its lowest level at a time when water was most needed for summer crops such as cotton, sugarcane and indigo. 'If an irrigation scheme were to come into operation at Ahwaz it appears that not only would the present service of steamers be unable to cope with the traffic but that it would be essential to see that navigation was not interfered with at a moment when water is most needed for the crops.' In his final report in August 1907, he modified this opinion to the extent of asserting the practicability of a scheme which left a minimum of water in the river sufficient for the needs of navigation, but on the whole his first views quoted above which Sir W. Willcocks, in 1909, fully endorsed, may probably be taken as representing the true state of things more correctly. Van Roggen's scheme, which Major Morton was called upon to criticise, may be briefly outlined as follows Total cost SJ million sterling, 85,000 acres to be irrigated, divided into 24 blocks of 3,500 acres, one such block to be^ brought under cultivation each year until all were in use : of each block 2,500 acres would be available for cultivation. Water to be supplied from a dam and river across the rapids at Ahwaz. The main, subsidiary and distributing channels to be also reservoirs for storing water in the season of low river. Three crops a year to be obtained. No water to be taken from the river from June to October inclusive, the necessary water being supplied from the reservoirs mentioned above. The canals in this scheme have there fore no bed slope, but are simply reservoirs, and as they are laid out symmetri cally on the ground without regard to levels, they must be higher above the general level of the ground than would otherwise be the case. Major Morton's principal criticisms on this scheme may be summarized as follows :— Van Roggen's proposal was to raise the water 4' above high flood level by a dam : he had however, taken no steps towards designing such a dam and had not made the necessary investigations to ascertain if it be possible or not. 1 See App. IX- 2 List of requests of the Mulzz-es-Saltaneh, July 1902 : — T^tract.~i^) That the Karun lands to the east which are included in Mohatnmerah territory and area place of cultivation of the tribe and clans of this humble servant should be granted to him as property in the same way as the Karun lands to the west opposite these were granted to the Nizam -es-Saltaneh. and he (the ShHikh) will of his own accord give a present for them. The land tax will be paid as formerly. Answer of the Persian Government to the above request.—{a) * * * * in rpo-ard f 0 ^ separate farman of H. I. M. has been issued. (F^e App. 10.) ^ 3 Vide assurances of Sir A. Hardiuge to Shaikh, of December 1902 (App, 6) and July 1903.65 Van Roggen did practically no levelling and his scheme was based upon quite insufficient observation; in consequence some of his main channels ran uphill and the whole scheme has been prepared with a total neglect of levels. As it is intended that the main channels should be used as reservoirs, locks are provided by Van Roggen where necessary. His estimate of crop outturn was far too high even for Indian canals, and quite out of the question for 'Arabistan where there are no good cultivators and waste of water would inevitably occur. Van Roggen had allowed too little for evaporation and too much for rainfall and had ignored the effect of silt in chocking his canals and reser voirs. In regard to labour, Major Morton considered the amount available in 'Arabistan insignificantly small compared with the amount of earth work to be executed for Van Roggen's scheme (2,800 million cubic feet). Van Rog- gen's proposals to import machines for the purpose was, he thought, impracti cable since apart from the initial cost of working (with coal at £2-55. a ton) they would for the most part be wholly unsuitable for the work required of them. Van Roggen's scheme allowed nothing for land compensation, although it was to be expected that numerous claims would be filed for compensation in respect of the lands to be occupied by him ; such compensation could not be estimated at less than £4 per acre. As regards the return on the capital to be expended by Van Roggen (2J millions) it was pointed out that if the Persian Government, or whoever supplied the capital, got 25 per cent, of the agricultural produce, the value of this would not amount in practice to more than per cent, on the capital invested even assuming the correctness of Van Roggen's optimistic estimates. Summarising his conclusions he stated that it was quite obvious that Van Roggen's scheme had no chance of paying financially in the small area which it was possible for the canal to irrigate. Even supposing the probable revenue to have been greatly underestimated, no reasonable figure could possi bly make it a success. Even with trebled revenue less than 5 per cent, on the capital outlay would be obtained. Van Roggen's scheme, he said, was 5 times as costly as the most expensive work in India, although based on the most rosy estimates of cost of labour, etc. Any scheme of irrigation from the Karun to be practicable must be in his view of the simplest possible kind, and finan cially without any juggling with figures and it should be worked with regard to the interests of the Shaikh of Mohammerah rather than those of the Persian Government. 1 ' The Government of India, in September 1905, agreed that Van Roggen's scheme was out of the question and requested Major Morton to go into the question of an alternative project on reasonable lines. In pursuance of these instructions Major Morton commenced further detailed surveys of both banks, embracing the whole area that could be commanded. In the meanwhile rumours of German participation in the scheme gained currency, although it does not appear that any investigation by Germans or by their agents had been made : the Shaikh of Mohammerah heard from a private source in Tehran that a German firm had been introduced to the Persian Government, and was prepared to lend 3,000,000 Tomans at 4 per cent, for the execution of the Karun works, a proposal which Mushir-ud- Dauleh was about to accept. No confirmation of this rumour could be ob tained although the Persian Government were suspected of trying to borrow money in Germany. An attempt was, however, made during the year to float an Internatiional Company with Dutch Directors and a capital of 30,000,000 francs for the purpose of working the Karun irrigation scheme. The Government of India, in September 1906, in reference to these rumours, stated that in their opinion any Karun irrigation concession should be obtained for British enterprise if possible, partly for political reasons so as to make it possible for them to obtain harbours in the Khur Musa, and partly in order to counterbalance the loss of trade which might result from the 1 It is not clear whether copies of Ma jor Morton's detailed criticisms of Van Kosrsren's scheme wptp ^ His Majesty's Legation by the Government of India. K66 closing of the KaruH. They were prepared to lend money to the Persian Government if such a concession could be secured and even to assist in the execution of the project if it was shown to be feasible and remunerative. The extension of German influence into the Karun and Khur Musa tract would be most prejudicial to British interests. If Germany were allowed to make such a loan she would acquire influence over the whole of Mohammerah and the eastern shore of the Shatt-al-'Arab. Eussia would presumably assist us in keeping out Germany. The retention of the Karun district by the British would have the additional advantage of securing support to already existing concessions of the Bakhtiari and Lur roads, both of which end at Ahwaz. Nothing more, however, was heard of German intervention 1 though the Dutch Minister did his best to use this possibility as a lever to induce the British Minister to co-operate in the Dutch scheme for an international svndicate. In December 1906, the Mu'in-ut-Tujjar, representing himself as speaking on behalf of the Shaikh of Mohammerah, announced to Sir Cecil Spring-Rice that the Shaikh was opposed to any foreign concession or to foreign financial help, but would like to form a purely Persian Company and to engage as ad viser a foreign expert. No doubt the Mu'in had in his mind the Nasiri Com pany, of which he is the embodiment and which has been so profitable to him self. But the Shaikh of Mohammerah when questioned on the subject of the Mu'in's remarks assured His Majesty's Consul that the Mu'in was not author ized to speak on his behalf and that he did not hold the opinion credited to him by the Mu'in. The Dutch scheme for an International Syndicate may be summarized as follows :—The Company to be registered in Holland and under Dutch jurisdiction and its principal officials to be of Dutch nationality. The concession to last for 80 years. The staff at Ahwaz to be international. The capital to be 35 million francs of which 40 per cent, to be Dutch and 20 per cent, to be taken up by the Sadr A'zam, of which 5 millions as an ad vance to the Persian Government, 4,000,000 as cost of floating Company, and 1,000,000 as reserve funds—a somewhat disproportionate allotment. It was not until August 1907 that Major Morton produced his final report. According to the plans and estimates he had prepared the cost of the scheme worked out at £450,000 : the dam which was to be of the needle type would command 250,000 acres, of which 150,000 would be irrigable annually. The annual revenue would be 8 per cent, out of which sinking fund charges and interest on capital would have to be met. The population required to cultivate the canals would be about 15,000 families—say 75,000 souls,—an addition of 50 per cent, to the population of 'Arabistan who are under the Shaikh's control. In October 1906, His Majesty's Minister addressed the following note to the Persian Government:— It has come to the knowledge of His Majesty's Government that a scheme is under consideration having for its object the concession of extensive rights to a foreign company in the neighbourhood of Ahwaz for the purpose of construct ing and operating irrigation works on the Karun. The Persian Government is well aware of the interests possessed by British subjects in that district, which have indeed been the subject of special orders and direct encouragement of His Majesty the late Shah, and of lengthy corre spondence between the Governments. A project of the character above stated is evidently calculated to introduce a very considerable change, both commercial and political, in the existing situation on the Kurun, and whilst expressing from this point of view its sincere sympathy with all projects of a nature to develop the resources of Persia, this Legation is instructed to state, that in view of the friendship so happilv existing between the Governments of the King and the Shuh, Sir Edward Grey is confident that no definite step will be taken in this matter above- mentioned without previous reference to His Majesty's Government. 1 In November 1907, tlie German Minister told the Netherlands Minister that there was no intention of asking for the Kariin irrigation concession for a German Firm.Hi) 67 The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Ala-es-Saltaneh, gave no written reply but informed Sir C. Spring-Rice verbally that the Persian Government had no intention of granting a concession for a foreign Company, as it was considered that such a concession would involve the grant of the right of foreign interference in the Karun valley. The Russian Minister was verbally informed of the contents of this note. The Dutch Minister in London was shortly afterwards informed that as the political situation in Persia was so unsettled and the moment so inoppor tune for encouraging foreign concessions, the Karun irrigation question could not be entertained for the present, but neither at this time, nor subsequently, does it appear that he was told of the very unfavourable view the Government of India, after consultation no doubt with irrigation experts in India, entirely concurred. The Dutch Minister believed then, as now, that the scheme would be very profitable as a commercial speculation and no suggestion appears from the official record to have been made to him that reverse was likely to be the case. In February 1907, the Netherlands Government asked that the British Government should adopt an attitude of neutrality to the scheme of obtain ing a concession for Karun irrigation for a Dutch Company from the Persian Government, and that His Majesty's Minister should be instructed to inform the Persian Government that His Majesty's Government would have no objection to such a concession : the Foreign Office favoured the suggestion but the India Office considered that the Shaikh of Mohammerah's views could not be ignored, and that the assurances of December 1902 and June 1903 were not irrelevant to the question. It was therefore advisable that the Persian Government should be recommended to recognize the Shaikh's position and consider his views. They might be informed at the same tlime that if a concession should eventually be granted to an international syndi cate, His Majesty's Government would desire to be informed of the details of the scheme, and in the absence of any objection to them or of any solid objec tion being raised by the Shaikh, they would adopt an attitude of neutrality. The belief that the Karun irrigation scheme was likely to yield large profits was in no way dissipated by Major Morton's earlier reports unfavour able though they were. In February 1907, His Majesty's Minister mentioned the Karun irrigation scheme as one of the most attractive of the concessions held by the National Bank, and he suggested the formation of an inter national syndicate, with a view to obtaining through the National Bank the rights to share in the concession for the irrigation of the Karun valley, in order to compete with a possible German offer. In June 1907, Sir E. Grey wrote to His Majesty's Minister who remained of the opinion that the proper course for His Majesty's Government to pursue was to follow the policy already laid down, i.e., that any scheme of irrigation which they favour must have the Shaikh's support, and that they must keep in touch with the latter as he desired. Sir Cecil Spring-Rice in the same month approved the suggestion tenta tively made by Shaikh Khaz'al to the 'Ain-ud-Dauleh through the agency of the Mu'in-ut-Tujjar to obtain the concession for himself with the right to obtain foreign capital up to one-third or one-half of the total amount required. It need hardly be pointed out that the Shaikh is unable to provide any thing like half of the total sum required for the works and that as a matter of fact, he is most unlikely to consent to invest a penny of his own in the scheme which he is convinced, and not without reason, cannot be profitable. In January 1909, Flis Majesty's Minister received information that the Dutch Minister had given a two years' option of the concession, the details to be the subject of subsequent negotiation. On receiving this information His Majesty's Minister informed the Persian Government that as they had disregarded the warning addressed to them in 1906 {v.s.) His Majesty's Gov ernment reserved their right to object to the scheme. In reply to this note, the Persian Government stated that in the event of a Company^ being formed and a concession granted under the option, we should have a right to oppose l 268 anything contrary to our interests and that they would take suitable steps to remove our objections. The Dutch Government were also informed that we could not support any scheme opposed to our interests or to the ideas of the Shaikh. They replied that they would give timely warning to the syndicate which is to be tormed, that no work could be undertaken without the co-operation of the was assured and Un ' leSS the su PP ort of the British Government Pj 6 too 'f stron g objection to the option having been granted, and f he alone had the right to carry it out, and without his foeWVhi a VT ^ ? a success - An attempt even on his part to coerce the Arabs would be disastrous.

KHAZ'AL-BIN-J ABIE, (L.S.) KHAZ'AL. The 24th Rahi'-al-Sani 1327. An undertaking in regard to land required by the Oil Company was obtained simultaneously. In reply to Major Cox's telegram detailing the declarations the Shaikh had given, His Majesty's Minister telegraphed approving the declarations and considered that the Shaikh's stipulations were such as could be accepted. He agreed that as regards the main scheme it would be more difficult to a concession in the name of some British Company than in the name of the Shaikh, but he could not hope that by adopting this course all dithculties with the Majlis would be avoided. The Karun irrigation scheme was believed to be so profitable and had been so much before the public that when the Shaikh applied w T e might expect that his intentions as to working the scheme would be subjected to the Closest scrutiny and that opposition would be considerable. But he added, we should have to shape our policy in many matters regardless of eventual opposition on the part of the Majlis it we were to maintain and strengthen our position in the Persian Gult. ^ P re - sumed that any claim for participation the Dutch Concessionaire might ha\e would presumably cease on the termination of his option. It might, however, be necessary to compound with him. 1 i.e., the concession shall be in the name of no Persian or British subject or foreigner but in the Shaikh's name only. ant j 2 It is of interest, however, to note that in the additional agreement between the Nizam-es-Saltaneh aid Abbis AghaTariverdieff the necessity of obtaining permission of the Persian Government and of the Majlis for the construction of dams on the Karkhah and Shaur i&gt; assumed to exist.70 a Dutch Minister in Tehran asked His Majesty's Charge d Affaires whether His Majesty's Government would raise any objection to a Dutch syndicate applying for the concession for irrigation works at Ahwaz m virtue of the option obtained by M. de Sturler. He said he understood that His Majesty's Government were only anxuHis to be assured that no third power was behind the Dutch group, and he could assure us that this was not the case. The Dutch syndicate hoped that at least one-half of the capital would be British and the remaining Dutch, and m the circumstances he presumed there would be no objection The scheme he said had been mooted not by himself but by a member of the Mai lis and he suggested that the acquisition of the concession would be rendered easier if the interest of His Majesty's Government in the matter was con cealed. A similar enquiry was made in London by the Dutch Minister there who assured His Majesty's Government that the Netherlands Government would not proceed in the matter of the Karun irrigation scheme without ncurrence of the Shaikh of Mohammerah. He was informed in reply that -Majesty s Government would not object in principle to the participation ot Uutch capital if the moment were opportune and the Company British. The Dutch Minister at Tehran thereupon set about to discover upon what terms the Shaikh's concurrence could be obtained, and in September 1910 informed H^ Majesty s M^mster at Tehran that he understood from a rela- wlfu i.

The Karkhah Irrigation Scheme. This scheme, which like the Karun scheme, involves the reconstruction of ancient works and the irrigation of areas watered in past times by canals, 1 has always been considered by the Shaikh as offering a far more profitable in vestment for capital than that of the dam at Ahwaz. As early as 1905, he expressed an opinion strongly in favour of the Kar khah irrigation scheme and gave His Majesty's Vice-Consul for 'Arabistan the following account of the manner in which the late Nizam -es-Saltaneh ob tained from the Shah a grant of the Kut Nahr Hashim lands, watered by the Karkhah, and those on the right of the Karun. Maul a 'Abdullah of Hawizeh in years gone by, be said, sought a port on the right bank cf the Karun from the Shaikh's predecessor Haji Jabir. Shaikh Jabir granted him a spot known as Umm-ut-Tammair. Later on they became alienated and Maula 'Abdullah claimed the whole of the right bank of the Karun. It was agreed to accept the evidence of Shaikh Faris of Fallahiyeh as final. Shaikh Khaz'al had now succeeded to the place of Haji Jabir. It unfortunately chanced that he fell out with the Ealluhiyeh Shaikh, and so forfeited the support which truth owed to him. At this point the Nizum-es-Saltaneh entered into the affair and attaching himself to Shaikh Miz'al's interests helped him to buy back the land from the Central Government (?) for him. The Shaikh said he held a letter from the Nizam in evidence of the real part he played in this transaction. Having, however, accomplished this service, the Nizum-es-Saltaneh turned round and declared that he held a partnership with Shaikh Miz'al in the ownership of the land. Prudential reasons restrained Shaikh Miz'al from denouncing the claim, and Shaikh Khaz'al on his accession to power found it inexpedient to bring the disputed ownership to an open test. The Karkhah scheme did not, however, at that time attract notice and it was not heard of again till 1909 when Sir A. Willcocks drew attention to the possibilities of irrigation from the Karkhah and suggested the advisability of commencing operations on that river, which could be dammed by the Shaikh with his own resources without the intervention of the Persian Government, and without arousing international jealousies. He pointed out that whilst a Karun irrigation scheme would make navigation impossible, the Karkhah scheme would have no effect, and being on similar scale would have a much better chance of success. A careful investigation and survey of the Karkhah river and the ground commanded by it was made during the year by Lieutenant Wilson assisted by Mr. J. W. Storrs, Public Works Department, and in January 1910, Sir Will- cocks actually visited Kut Nahr Hashim, and spent several days there in ex amining the ground and the proposed site for a dam. He came to the con clusion after careful investigation, that the best site for* a dam for irrigation purposes on the Karkhah was at Sin'al 'Abbas, about 5 miles above Kut Nahr Hashim. At this site a stratum of good sand stone rock over 8 feet thick straight across the river is available for the foundations of a dam. From the detailed estimates prepared by Mr. Storrs under Sir W. Willcocks' super vision it appears that the dam itself would cost £38,000; adding 33 per cent, for contingencies, establishment and buildings, the total cost would be raised to about £50,000. The cost of the head regulator (plus 33 per cent.) was esti mated at £3,700 and earth work for the canal leading to the cut through the Kut Nahr Hashim hill £17,000. The total estimate, after liberal provision for contingencies came to £75,000. 100,000 acres could be irrigated by the canal all the year round : and a revenue of £20,000 could be counted on by the Shaikh. It will be plain from the foregoing that from a technical point of view the scheme is excellent and large profits might be expected from it, the objeC- 1 Khanler Mirza, Governor of Arabistan in 1851, made the upper dam at Kut Tfahr Hashim ' for th? purpose of restoring the river Karkhah to the ancient channel past the town of Hawizeh which was abandoned by the stream in 1832.' The project was a complete failure and a large portion of it was earned away by a sudden rise of the river. Seven thousand tomans were spent on the project it is said. As soon as the great rise took place the water flooded into the new cutting known as Mashriyeh, but from an unexplained cause rushed back again, thus demolishing all the works. (Loftus Chaldea and Susiana, 1857, p. 361 and p. 431.j72 tions to the scheme are of another kind. In addition to the fact that the land is not the Shaikh's but belongs partly, at all events, to the heirs of the late JNIizam-es-Saltaneh, whose claim the Shaikh has recognised by annual payments of £3,000 or less, there is the question of Bani Turuf to be con- sidered. This tribe inhabiting Hawizah and the marshes of the Karkhah 1 stands to lose from any scheme which would diminish the volume of water below Nahr Hashim, and unless they can be compensated, or overawed, their opposition, if actually pushed, might make the execution of the project diffi- cu t. But there is no reason to think that the tribe could not be compensated q I T j n 1 ew ca ^ als '. n01 : that the y would not accept such terms if the bnaikn showed determination in enforcing his will in the matter, Q , The political uncertainties of 1909 and 1910 and the preoccupation of the fenaikh m other directions precluded any active steps being then taken to lollow up the report of Sir W. Willcocks on this scheme. In October 1910, however, the Political Resident reminded the Shaikh of the favourable re ports that had been rendered by Sir W. Willcocks in regard to this scheme and suggested to him the advisability of taking active steps in the matter. He pointed out that strategically Kut Nahr Hashim was well placed and tliat it would consolidate his rule to have a settlement there. The proiect ad never been particularly mentioned in Tehran and political considerations would probably not be invoked to prevent its execution, nor is it a matter in which international interests would need to be consulted. If he embarked on , an 7 domestic scheme himself he would have every reason for insisting and the British Government for supporting him in demanding that he should not be interfered with in the execution of it. In self-defence therefore, and to prevent encroachment on his rights, he would be prudent to consider the advisability of taking up this scheme without delay. His Majesty's Govern ment would no doubt endeavour to introduce to him reliable financiers who would lend him the whole or part of the money and would get an engineer to make preliminary borings at his expense. But the first necessary step seemed to be to decide what attitude he was in a position to assume, or could most advisedly assume, towards the present Nizam-es-Saltaneh, who as he was aware claimed rights of these lands, and was anxious to develop them, if need be, with foreign assistance. J an uary 1911, the Nizam-es-Saltaneh met the Shaikh at Ahwaz and Mohammerah on his way to Bushire to assume the Governor Generalship of r ars. The whole question of the Nizam's properties in 'Arabistan came under review, and a tentative arrangement was come to whereby the Shaikh should purchase half of all the Nizam's properties in the name of Shaikh Kasib, the tormers son and should be the Nizam's sole Agent in respect of the latter's share in such lands. Up to the end of 1911, however, no progress was made PART III. III.— Concession of Lands near Dizftjl to a Russian Subject. The last scheme to be dealt with under the heading of Irrigation is that for which a Russian subiect named 'Abbas Aqa Tariverdieff obtained a con cession from Riza Quh Nizam-es-Saltaneh, in 1909. The area in question is near Shush some 15 miles south of Dizful, and lies between Zawiah village on the north Shush on the south and is bounded on the east and west by the rivers Diz and Karkhah, respectively. The period of the lease was for 25 years, in return for which the lessee was bound to pay during the period of 25 ve'ars a total sum of 136,000 tomans, in annual instalments commencing at 4 100 tomans a year and running up to 7,300 tomans a year. On the other hand failure to pay an instalment within one month of due date entailed the forfei- 1 Previous to 1882 the Karkhah flowed past the lars-e Arah town n* t I , . h,I ' pc ° ea ' Iea ™ s Hawi ' &lt;A73 ture of the lease—a provision which enables the Nizam to foreclose at any time now, as it appears that no payments have been made by the lessee. The lessee was permitted to transfer tJae lease, but remained responsible that the sub-lessee observed the conditions prescribed. The owner was entitled to receive rent in advance less interest at a rate not mentioned. The owner was bound to afford all assistance in his power to prevent disturbances affecting the lessee. If the lessee found it necessary to construct a dam on the river Karkhah or Shush the owner of the estate was to afford him every assistance towards obtaining the permission of the Persian Government and of the National Advisory Assembly for the construction of the dam. It was also provided that if the lessee was led to make a road to Moham- merah or Band-i-Qir or Dizful the owner was bound to afford him all possible assistance in obtaining the necessary concession. This of course clashed with Messrs. Lynch Brothers' concession which includes a Dizful-Ahwaz road. The lands in question are occupied by A1 Kathir Arabs under Shaikh Haidar bin Ghafil and have been for some years under the suzerainty of the Shaikh of Mohammerah who leases the grounds from the Nizam-es-Saltaneh and recovers what he can from the Arabs. The nominal rental is 4,500 tomans for the Hussainabad lands in addition to Government dues amount ing to 1,000 tomans. They seem to have been granted to the Nizam in ex change for lands in Kurdistan which he surrendered to the Persian Govern ment. The Shaikh on learning that the concession only covered lands near Shush outside his immediate jurisdiction, announced that he himself was not concerned in the matter and that he could leave it with the Arab tribes, who would probably make things lively for the lessee. Mr. Marling, in informing the Foreign Office of the Shaikh's attitude, said that as the Shaikh was not personally interested in those lands we were precluded from making any opposition to the scheme through him, except by suggesting to him that he could urge the local tribes to.insist on their rights. Sucn a course would involve us in responsibility for local disorders, an un desirable consummation. As the prospects of the scheme seemed question able and the rumoured employment of German capital still to be proved, we should do well to await further developments. He added that as irrigation works were not included in those enterprises which we have notified to the Persian Government as affecting our interests it would not be easy to make overt objections to the scheme. The distance from Mohammerah of the lands covered by the concession, the very great cost of transport therefrom, the unsettled state of the neigh bourhood, the Turko-Persian and Luristan boundaries being within a few miles, all militate against the success of the scheme. At the end of 1910 the concessionaire had taken no open steps to take possession of the lands, but in March 1911, His Majesty's Minister telegraphed that he was informed that 'Abbas Aqa had arrived in Tehran and intended to proceed south without delay. Developments are awaited, the Nizam-es-Saltaneh promised to the Shaikh that he would do all that he could to upset 'Abbas Aqa's lease, and in view of the Shaikh's opposition it seems improbable that the lessor will be able to enjoy his lease.74 CHAPTER XL Land Tenure and Acquisition of Land by Foreigners in 'Arabistan. The Persian Government have always viewed with disfavour the acquisi tion of rights in Persian soil by foreigners, though the British Government by virtue of Article 12 of the Treaty of Paris, 1857, enjoy the same privileges m this respect as were accorded to Russian subjects by paragraph 5 of the Compact referred to in Article 10 of the Treaty of Turkmanchai, 1 1828. i British subjects have been established hitherto only at few places Messrs. Lynch Brothers rent houses at Dizful, Shushtar and Ramuz, Su -i iT aZ TT^ r( l I ? Nizam-es-Saltaneh) and at Mohammerah (from the bnaikh). His Majesty's Vice-Consulate at Ahwaz is leased from a Persian ^ nt L,* 11 ® Majesty's Consulate at Mohammerah is leased from the • '7i! 1 K--^T he T ^ n S 1 I 0 ' Pe 1 rsian 0il Company hold land on long lease at Brain in Abbadan Island and at Ahwaz above the rapids and occupy a piece of lanc V ^ u PPer Karun in regard to which no settlement has yet been reacted. Messrs. Lynch Brothers lease a store house at Shalill, 5 miles south ot bnushtar, from Shaikh Murtaza, a Shushtari, and at Mohammerah they lease a store and wharf from the Persian Government. The Imperial Bank of Persia have leased land and a residential dwellino' above Mohammerah on the Karun from the Shaikh and an office in the town on t le river front from Haji Rais. They have leased an office in Nasiri from klf 8 ! 1 ^ mer P hant and a residential dwelling outside the town from Shaikh British IndTa ^ * PerSian sub J €ct ' but naturalised as a British subject in There are, therefore, no lands in 'Arabistan actually owned by British subjects, although the Oil Company's concession empowers them to purchase land, as also does that of the Imperial Bank of Persia. • The reason for this is firstly the prohibition against the erection of build- g s _ or dcpets on the^ banks of the Karun contained in paragraph 6 of the ( A PP endix 2 ). and secondly the extreme reluctance ot the Shaikh himself to part with his rights of ownership in land. The con dition which was essential in all his farmans, upon which he holds his lands trom the Persian Government, is that he shall not alienate any portion of them MnhT 31 ^ 1101 ^ am ? f bls ,P ro . vlso has strictly observed. The cemeteries at Mohammerah and Ahwaz alone can be considered the property of foreigners J %.Hv e t r.tfr^ ammerah 7 aS f 1Iotted free of cost for the Purpose'in 1903 by the Shaikh of Mohammerah at the request of the Persian Government Who were asked by His Majesty's Minister to issue the necessary'order to the S aikh in the matter. The Mushir-ud-Dauleh wrote to Sir A. Hardin'e on January 3rd 1903, that he had written to the Sardar Arfa, asking him to give permission for the purchase of a piece of land for the purpose The fur port of the Mushir-ud-Dauleh's letter to the Shaikh is as follows My honourable servant. Considerable importance is attached by the Shaikh to this letter though n reality it proves nothing except perhaps that the Persian Government S this date recognised the lands at Mohammerah as being owned by pri'er hoC^r.f.11 or C proper the f„ r e ip saM e ctB to find in Pema not only to vent bat also to acquire! ty every S of owne^ii!,' t' P T V . t0 ***** 'bjW. rooms and places in which to deposit their merchandise.' 0 ownei snip, houses to live m, as well as ware-75 A cemetary at Nasiri was allotted by the Shaikh in 1909 without the intervention of the Central Government, at the request of His Majesty's Con sul for 'Arabistan. Besides the Shaikh the only other land owners of importance in South 'Arabistan are the Nizam-es-Saltaneh's heirs, late Mushir-ud-Dauleh's heirs and Mu'in-ut-Tujjar (The Nasiri Company). The heirs of the late Nizam-es-Saltaneh are at present minors and their interests are being guarded by the present Nizam-es-Saltaneh, Riza Quli Khan, who thus practically owns the following tracts :— Hussainabad. Kut Nahr Hashim (Karkhah). Karun west bank. Shwabeh (between Diz and Shatait). The Jarrahi district, owned by the Mushlr-ud-Dauleh and the Nizam-es-Saltaneh. All the above districts are farmed by the Shaikh, who pays rent for them varying in amount according to the amount which he has been able to collect from the Arabs occupying the district in question. The Mu'in-ut-Tajjar owns lands at Shushtar and at Nasiri {vide Nasiri Company's concession. Appendix 3) and he claims the landing place at Shalili, and in particular the site on which Messrs. Lynch Brothers' store stands which was erected for them by Shaikh Murtaza. He has disposed of some of his land at Nasiri by sale and his claim to other portions is disputed by the Shaikh. The Persian Government owns a little land in Mohammerah :—The Kar- guzarate, Quarantine station. Customs Rest House adjoining the Quarantine, and the Customs House and Messrs. Lynch Brothers' wharf. The two last named sites which adjoin each other are c waqf' and were leased from the owners who are Saiyids 1 in about 1890, together with the ground in rear of them. The German firm of Wonckhaus &amp; Co. leased in 1907 for a period of 8 years a patch of ground for use as a store and wharf, but though they pay 100 tomans a year for an area of a little more than an acre, they have no rights over the foreshore nor even over the strip of ground 30 yards broad which intervene between their land and the river. 2 The system in which land is held by Arabs in 'Arabistan deserves men tion. Grazing lands are held without fee by custom and the reallotment of such lands necessitated by tribal changes is arranged by mutual consent with the intervention of the Shaikh. Fertile lands watered by rain only are held similarly, most Arabs of the Muhaisin and other tribes, living in the date grove districts have a few acres of land allotted to them in the Karun district on which they sow wheat or bar ley, paying taxes in kind on the produce. Date groves and rice fields in Fallahiyeh are held from father to son on the strength of ancient title-deeds granted by Shaikhs of the Ka'ab, but when these lapse by reason of the non-existence of heirs in direct line or from other causes, the ground is reallotted and title-deeds issued by the Shaikh of Moham merah giving the fallah the rights of ownership and sale in J of the land, and the right to | of J or even \ of the date crop on the whole area, the rest being the property of the Shaikh. All subsidiary crops grown in the date groves are supposed to belong to the 'fallahs (cultivators). The only land known to be held by foreigners in this way is that held by Hussain bin Jamadar Yusuf Baluch, a British Indian subject, who has a little land near Mohammerah which he inherited from his father who was a mercenary in the employ of Haji Jabir. 1 Of the families of 'Abdul Qabar &amp; Sliaikh Habib. 2 On 27tli April 1908, His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires was informed by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs that the proceedings of Messrs. R. Wonckhans. and Co., and other foreign agencies should be Wi tched by the Consul at Mohammerah with a view to preventing the Shaikh from leasing further land to them. L 276 A nnex, to C hapter XI.

This favour to the Consulate is not to be a precedent for merchants. K the Vice-Consul wishes to make any alterations or additions to the Consulate he must do so at his own expense, and it has nothing to do with the owner and he cannot claim compensation for such additions when he wishes to lease the Consulate. His Majesty s Consul has agreed to undertake the following repairs at his own expense, namely, plastering the roof, repairing the doo^s and win dows. and cleaning and painting the rooms and walls. If a room or a wall falls down or the dam in front of the buildin^ be broken by water His Excellency will make the necessary repairs. A man^ill be appointed from the Consulate to supervise along with a man from His Excellency all matters concerning the building. Seals and signature of Mr. McDouall (L. S.).

As the latter document does not specify any period of 10 years and is capable of more favourable construction than the above, the matter has been allowed to rest at this.

Lynch Br other £ Mohammerah store and wharf. The reason of writing this lease (which is signed by the Karguzar) for the store and wharf of Bandar Sahib Qraniyeh, which is to be occupied by the English Company, Lynch Brothers, is as follows :— For the sake of facilitating and encouraging trade, although the above- mentioned wharf is situated at the frontier of Mohammerah and is the pro perty of the Imperial Persian Government, the Karguzar of 'Arabistan has agreed to lease same to the respected and faithful firm of the Imperial British Empire and previous to the expiration of the period of the lease a renewal must be made and the said Company are to pay over Krans 150 per month which amount must be paid in advance from the commencement of the lease. Messrs. Lynch Brothers are now demanding a renewal and extension of the lease which commences from 1st March 1907, which is the last date of the previous lease, for a period of 72 months by paying the rate mentioned above, and in accordance with their request, it has been agreed upon by the Karguzar and Messrs. Lynch Brothers on the following conditions :— (1) The amount of the lease, viz., Krans 11,000 the Company is bound to pay in cash to the Karguzar against his receipts. (2) For a period of four months commencing from ist Zil Qad'eh 1323 both parties are empowered to cancel this lease in order to alter any condition herein stated and at the expiration of above80 period there will be no right for either party to forego any of the above conditions but they must agree to same. (3) Should during the period of four months either party wish to cancel this agreement of lease the amount of Krans 11,000 must be retunded to the said Company, otherwise the said amount will be held against lease of store and wharf which is now occupied by the said Company for 72 months commencing from 1st March 1907. 4 5 (4) All protections to the store and wharf such as repairs to the build ing plastering, rebuilding broken walls, etc., etc., must be borne by the said Company during the said period and the Kar^uzar is not liable to pay anything. &amp; (5) During the said period Messrs. Lynch Brothers are not empowered to alter the form of the store and wharf in any way and the building must stand in the same position as it is. (6) Should at the expiration of the period of this lease there be no consent from either party for renewal of further extension of Jease the said Company must hand over the store, wharf and property, etc. in actual condition to the aforesaid Karguzar of the Imperial Persian Government and has no right whatever to make any claim either for property, cash, or any compensation. (7) And because the said store and wharf were built by the Shah Nasrrudin, martyr and inventor of Qran at the opening of the river Karun as a commercial port for the navigation of steamers of the great powers who are in friendly relation he therefore named the said store and wharf Sahib Qraniyeh and fre tn e n S a 1^ respect, etc., to the late Shah the said Company are to call the wharf by this name. • jV he a 1 bovemeatione d conditions two copies of this agreement were signed by each party, each holding a copy, agreement, were HUSSAIN, The 1st Zil Qad'eh 1323.

(Copied from Hertslet's 'Persian Treaties,' 1891.) Translation. Explanations of the foregoing Convention, made under date of the 8th Zi'l Hijja the Sacred, (A. H.) 1292 (4th January 1876), on the part of the Sub lime Porte, in a Wazirial Letter notified to all the Judges of the Ottoman Dominions, a copy thereof being officially communicated to the exalted Per sian Legation residing in Constantinople. Although 12 out of the 14 Articles contained in the said Collation (muqabila-nameh) 2 are of a kind clear and manifest, still, for the purpose that, in the interpretation of Articles I and VII, no manner of discrepancy shall remain, it is undertaken, as follows, to give certain explanations to this effect: Trial and Puwishment for Personal Injuries, Crimes, and Misdemeanours. Although, in accordance with Article I, ' the subjects of the exalted Per sian Government who are in the Ottoman Dominions, in every matter relating to personal injuries, crimes, and misdemeanours, are individually subject to the Regulations and Laws of the Ottoman Empire, and directly to the police and tribunals of the said Empire; and in order to the sentencing of indivi duals whose crime, offence or misdemeanour has been proved, the judicial sen tence issued shall be communicated to the Persian Officials in a certified copy thereof and in the preliminary investigations that take place in respect of them until the culpability or innocence of them shall become apparent, the pre sence in person, or by a representative, of the Persian Agents and Vice- Agents will necessarily be permissible : still, as the effect of this Article covers such kinds of acts as may have occurred between subjects of the exalted Government (of Turkey) and subjects of the exalted Persian Government, it will become needful in this case, that, for one individual Persian wronged or bodily injured, an Ottoman adverse party should exist; and thence a right and capacity ensues for the Persian Officials to inquire into the punitory result de creed against an Ottoman subject. Any information of this kind that may be asked for by them must be given. Settlement of Suits and Disputes. Detention of Persians by Ottoman Police. Again, since, according to the details set forth in Article VII kt every kind of suit or contestation,' ' whether relating to rights,' ' offences, crimes, or per sonal injuries ' that may arise between two Persian subjects must be settled by means of the Persian Agents and Vice-Agents, the decision and determin ation of all such suits and their other mutual dealings must be relegated to the Agents and Vice-Agents; for this same reason it will be necessary in the case where the delinquents are taken and detained by the local police at the very time of their criminal act, whenever they may be proved to be really Persian subjects, they shall be immediately delivered to the Agents and Vice-Agents. And this act of detention shall only then be put in practice when the said act takes place openly. Otherwise, whenever they occur in the place of abode of one individual Persian, such conduct and action will naturally be observed as, according to what is set forth in Article XIV, shall be consistent with the system which, in like cases, is practised in respect of other foreign subjects.

(21) As this permission to the mercantile marines of friendly Govern ments to navigate the Karun is solely for the purpose of facilitating and stimulating trade and nothing else, this will by no means be allowed to be made a pretext for political discussions of any sort. (22) The regulations obtaining regarding wrecks on shores generally shall govern such cases and the salvage shall be paid to the natives of the shore. / (23) Dangerous goods such as arms, etc., shall not he sold by the employes of the vessels to Persian subjects, nomads or tribes, if sold they will be seiz and their value returned. , .

Extract from a letter from Sir Arthur Hardinge to Shaikh Khaz'al of Moham- merah, dated Tehran, December 7th y 1902. T ranslation. * * I was very glad to hear from Haji Rais-ut-Tujjar of the satisfac tory arrangement concluded between you and the Department of Customs. On general grounds of policy it is very desirable that differences should as far as possible be avoided between the Persian authorities and the Arab tribes under your rule. The relations between the British and Persian Governments are of a friendly character and the preservation of the integrity and in dependence of the Persian Monarchy has for many years been one of the great objects of British policy in this part of the world, disturbances of a nature to imperil that object would be a serious evil and you would gain little and might endanger much by throwing off the sovereignty of the Shah. I am convinced that under the present circumstances the Arabs and yourself as their ruler have every interest in cultivating good and loyal relations with the Govern ment of Tehran and that the latter has no desire to oppress you or curtail your authority. For this reason I think you acted wisely in giving up the idea of forcible resistance to the establishment of a customs house and in seek ing rather to come, as I have from the first urged you to, to a friendly under standing on this subject with the customs administration. Haji Rais-ut-Tujjar has asked me on your behalf to what extent you might rely on the protection of the British Government and I told him that so long as you behaved to us in a friendly manner, our influence would be exerted here to maintain you and your tribes in the enjoyment of your hereditary rights and customs and to dissuade the Government of Tehran from any en deavour to diminish or interfere with them. Haji Rais-ut-Tujjar thereupon said that you were not afraid of the Persian Government itself or of attacks ;by neighbouring tribes acting or pretending to act under its orders, but that you wished to know whether we should protect you in the event of an attempt by a foreign power to depose you or deprive your people of the rights which they at present possess. This might happen in two ways : either such a power might be at war with Persia and might as an enemy of the Shah send ships to attack your district or such a power pretending to be the friend of the Persian Government or to act in its behalf might attempt also by means of its ships to conquer you and the Arabs. I replied that both contingencies were extremely unlikely but if either were to arise we should, I believed, interfere provided you had acted in accordance with our advice, and our fleet which is the strongest of any in the Persian Gulf would be employed to prevent any forcible measures against you. I added however that I would refer the ques tion to the Foreign Minister of the British Government, and he has now100 authorised me to say that we shall protect Mohammerah against naval attack by a foreign power whatever pretext for intervention may be alleged and also so long as you remain faithful to the Shah and act in accordance with our advice we will continue to give you our good offices and support. As I have however said above I do not regard this danger at any rate at present as a real one. The Persian Government desires I am sure as earn estly as we do the preservation of peace in Arabistan and the establishment ot a customs house at Mohammerah is, as I assured you last year, a fiscal, not a political, measure. It has already informed me m a friendly jp^t ot the conditions under which the new arrangement has been made and the Britisn Government has instructed me to intimate its acquiescence m them. We reserve of course our right to object to any further change w ic we may consider likely as affecting peace and trade on the Karun, to be detri mental to our interests. I hope that the new arrangement may work smoothly. There will very likely be some small difficulties and friction at first, but I trust to your wis om and iudgment to deal with them prudently and patiently Our Consul has my orders to afford you all help and advice and yon may place every reliance on my friendship. You can write to me freely should you wish to do so as well as to the Resident at Bushire. Your sincere friend, ARTHUR HARDINGE. APPENDIX VII.

And further, we have granted and made over the said place to the Sardar-i-Arfa himself as a perpetual property, so that he will be permitted and authorised to exercise every function of ownership over the same, with the exception of transferring it to foreign subjects, and that he may please and delight the great and loyal mind by his good services in enhancing the prosperity of that locality.

List of the requests of His Excellency Mu'izz-es-Saltaneh, and replies of the Persian Government thereto, 1903. List of Requests. (1) As regards the compliance with the order of the Persian Government in the matter of the Customs and with regard to putting a new tariff in force he obeys, but in order that the Arab tribes and clans may not be alarmed at the outset he requests that for a time he may be entrusted with the putting in force of the new tariff so that he may make them understand that a tiresome burden will not be (put) upon them. He will hold in accordance with orders from the Customs Ministry and hand over the Customs revenues month by month to any quarter which the Ministry of Customs may order; that a Bel gian Examiner of Accounts comes once a month to examine the books and ac counts and business there; should there be any discrepancy demonstrated Muizz-es-Saltaneh will acquit himself of the responsibility.104 (2) Should this proposal and loyal request of this humble servant not be considered advisable, that a Persian Official from the Customs who is ac quainted with the ways of the Arab clans be appointed to put the new tariff in force; should there be a foreign official from the outset or should a matter of importance be put in force, I fear that difficulties might arise. (3) The Customs revenues which according to the usage of years are in cluded in the taxes (maliyat) paid over year by year to the Government of 'Arabistan, these they must order to be reserved (deducted) from the maliyat' itself. (4) The Customs Administration has no right to interfere in the concerns ot the Arabs and the Provincial Government (or) to interfere in any kind of matter which is outside Customs business. (5) They must ask this humble servant himself to appoint the workmen and servants who may be requisite for the Customs, so that, should there be a fault or lack of orders in the Customs, this devoted servant should be respon sible; should they wish to appoint servants themselves, (and) God forbid should there be any irregularity or fault or theft, then they should not hold this humble servant responsible for order or protection. (6) As to the new tariff contemplated, dates and berries, etc., must be exempt at export; Customs dues must not be levied and on import they shall pay 5 per cent.; should more be levied at other frontier places, then more must be imposed at Mohammerah also, but on the understanding that nothing further shall be claimed from that which pass at the frontier, in order that the trade of Mohammerah and 'Arabistan also may be confident in this matter and free and hopeful. (7) That assurances may be given to the Arabs and tribes and clans that those gardens and date plantations of Mohammerah and dependencies which they themselves and their forefathers have planted shall not in the future be taken from their possession, and that they must possess their own property in confidence, and that the Government will never contemplate selling these under the title of Crown lands, that the land tax be paid according to the custom of former years, that a firman of proprietary rights be granted to them that they may be hopeful and secure. (8) Seeing that when the Customs go out of the hands of this humble ser vant, the difference which for years came to me and to the expenses of the fron tier from the Customs there, disappears, therefore M. Simais made an agree ment and gave me a writing that a salary of one thousand tomans per month should be allotted me out of the Customs revenues that I might attend to the protection of the frontier and to the guardians of order. I would request that a farman on this point may also be issued and granted. (9) That the Karun lands to the east which are included in Mohammerah territory and are a place of cultivation and (a place) of the tribes and clans of this humble servant should be granted (to him) as property in the same way that the Karun lands to the west opposite these were granted as property to His Excellency Nizam-es-Saltaneh, and he {i.e., Mu'izz-es-Saltaneh) will of his own accord give a present for them. The land tax (maliyat) will be paid as formerly. (10) As to the Dehmulla and Hindij an which are Crown lands and are an asset in the account of this humble servant, he consents to pay the Government taxes (maliyat-i-diwani) for those places; he prays that they may be granted to him m proprietary right; the present usual in the case of the Crown land will be obediently made; the object of this humble servant is that at the time by an artifice these lands should not be bought by others, which would cause trouble and dispute, and that they should be a cause of hope and keep the people occupied in cultivation and (give them) peace and quiet. Answers to the claims of His Excellency the Mu'izz-es-Saltaneh. (!) With reference to clauses Nos. 1, 2 and 5, His Excellency Mu'izz-es- baltaneh has been promoted to the dignity of Head of the Customs of the ports of Mohammerah and Arabistan, 1 and must in all matters exercise full care 1 See Appendix II.105 and attention (enquiry) and give effect on occasion to the directions of the Ministry of Customs, but as tnere is not in the ports of Mohammerab a suit able and proper official who is capable of performing these functions and of levying and paying over the Customs dues according to the new tariff, which will actually (or is actually) be levied at the other frontiers, therefore the Hon ble M. Waffelaert, a Belgian official in the service of the Imperial Government of Persia, will be sent together with Mirza Yantz, a natural born Persian subject, to help the said M. Waffelaert, that M. Waffelaert should have the rank of Departmental Head under the general direction, and His Excel lency Mu'izz-es-Saltaneh should also be under the orders of the Ministry of Customs. It is clear that M. Waffelaert must act with all deference and res pect towards the aforesaid (Mu'izz-es-Saltaneh) and in all matters pertaining to the Customs in regard to the Arabs and the population he must on neces sary occasions accept and comply with the counsels and orders of His Excel lency Mu izz-es-Saltaneh; and in like manner His Excellency Mu'izz-es- Saltaneh is bound to act in all friendliness to the officials and give them the fullest support and assistance, and is also bound to allow his small steam boats to be at the disposal of them (the Customs officials) whenever the Customs Ad ministration may wish to examine and inspect ships carrying merchandise in order that they may be able to levy the dues of 5 per cent, on all merchandise incoming and outgoing. It is certified that in this case not a dinar shall be levied in the interior under any name or usage from the merchandise which has paid its dues. The appointment and selection of the servants and officials necessary for the Customs Administration will assuredly be (made) wifh His Excellency Mu'izz-es-Saltaneh's approval. (2) This will be accepted as requested. (3) As has been set forth the Customs Administration will not interfere in any way whatsoever with the business of the Provincial Government (Hukumat). (4) The answer has been given in the first and second articles. (5) Dates and other fruits fresh and dry which are produced in Moham- merah and the district thereof will be entirely and always exempt and free from export Customs dues. It must be noted that the export of grain is for bidden, but whenever the Imperial Government knows that the grain product is in excess of the food requirements of the inhabitants and dwellers in that district, then it will give special permission in regard to the export of grain, and conditions as regard levy of Customs dues in that district also will be laid down in accordance with the conditions which may be laid down in other ports. (6) On this matter a separate autograph has been issued by His Glorious, Blessed, Most Holy and Imperial Majesty. 1 (Here writing, apparently Shah's ' sahib '.) (7) Certainly salary must be given to His Excellency Mu'izz-es-Saltaneh in return for his services. One thousand tomans a month which is a yearly salary of 12 thousand tomans must be given to His Excellency as salary from the Customs. (Here writing, which appears to be Shah's ' sahih '.)

Apparently of Shah. 1 See Appendices VII and VIII. 2 See Appendix IX.106 These requests and concerns of Mu'izz-es -Saltaneh, Shaikh Khaz'al Khan, which the Ministry of Customs has, with the cognizance of the Minis try of Foreign Affairs, accepted, and has written an answer, are correct.

Translation of Shaikh of Mohammerah*s Customs Farman, dated Rabi II, 1320 [ = June 1902). Seal of Muzaffar-ud-Din Shah. By the Grace of God, Whereas Our Royal, August and sacred mind is strongly inclined towards the entire reformation of the Customs Department of the exalted (Persian) Government, and whereas its regulation and arrangement are calculated to the ease of the general public, we have therefore appointed and selected efficient and competent persons as Directors (of Customs) in the provinces, countries, territories and ports. The degree of the efficiency and competence of His Ex cellency Shaikh Khaz'al Khan Mu'izz-es-Saltaneh, Amir Tuman, being also obvious and evident to us, we have, therefore, honoured him with the post of Director General of Customs in the ports of Mohammerah and 'Arabistan and he must have full superintendence and supervision over all the affairs and give effect to the instructions of the Customs Ministry. But as there is no capable and worthy official in the port of Mohammerah who may be fit to render this service and recover the Customs duty in accordance with the New Tariff, as iss at present levied in the other territories, therefore, Monsieur Waffelaert, who is a Belgian official employed by the exalted Government, with Mirza Yantz, a Persian subject, will be sent for the purpose of assisting him, so that Monsieur Waffelaert should act as a subordinate under the Director General and the Mu'izz-es-Saltaneh should also be under the control of the Customs Ministry. It is obvious that Monsieur Waffelaert must behave towards His Excellency with extreme reverence and respect and should accept, and comply with his advices and instructions at necessary junctures, in all the Customs affairs relating to the Arabs and natives. In the same way, the Mu'izz-es-Sal- taneh undertakes to treat the officials with the utmost friendliness and to afford them the fullest support and co-operation. And he also undertakes to give his acquiescence for his own small steam pinaces to be at their disposal whenever the Customs Department wishes to investigate and search vessels laden with merchandise, so that 5 per cent, duty can be recovered from the mer chandise imported and exported. It is confirmed that under these circum stances absolutely not a single cent shall be recovered in the interior of the country, under any name or guise whatever, from such merchandise as has already paid its duty. The selection and appointment of the necessary em ployes and staff for the local Customs Department shall be made with the ap proval of the Mu'izz-es-Saltaneh. In consideration of this worthy service on his part, we have granted and fixed for him by way of salary a sum of 1,000 tomans per mensem, making a total of 12,000 tomans per annum, out of the Customs incomes, as suggested by His Most Noble Excellency the Atabeg-i- A'zam, so that every year he may receive it and busy himself in rendering ser vices, with the utmost confidence. It is commanded that the respected Royal Secretaries should register this auspicious Farman and consider it their duty to do.

Agreement entered into between the Sardar Arfa', Amir Nuyan, Shaikh Khaz'al Khan ibn Haji Jabir Khan, heirs and successors, and his tribesmen, on the one part, hereinafter called ' the Shaikh ' and Messrs. Anglo-Persian Oil Co., Limited, of London, on the other part, hereinafter called ' the Com pany,' in respect of lands required by the said Company in the territories of the former, for the purpose of their business, under the exclusive privileges of the concession granted to Mr. W. K. D'Arcy by His Majesty the Shah of Persia on the 28th May 1901. Whereby it is agreed that:— 1. The Shaikh undertakes to hire to the said Company an area free of date trees of 650 (six hundred and fifty) jaribs of 4,669 square yards per jarib, on 'Abbadan Island, situated between the village of Braim on the north-west and Bawairdeh on the south-east, having a frontage of about 2,000 yards on the Shatt-al-'Arab, and also a strip of land not less than thirty yards in breadth for a right of way connecting the land abovementioned with the Bahmanshir River : but the public rights of way must remain. 2. Should the said Company find the ground selected as above, after further examination, not suitable for the requirements, they should have the right to select other sites of the same area and same description. Should the Company require more land, free of date trees, adj acent to the lands leased to them, the, Shaikh undertakes, in case the Company asks for such land within108 i a space of two years from the date of this agreement, to grant them land not exceeding one hundred jaribs in area, at the same moderate rate. If the said Company ask for more land after two years from the date of this agreement, they shall pay rental at the fair current rate of the time for similar land in those localities. 3. The Shaikh further undertakes to grant free of charge to the Com pany a strip of land for the laying of such pipe-lines as may be necessary, above or below ground, situated in his lands or in those lands for the time being under his jurisdiction, or leased or purchased by him from others, with access thereto: and also to grant free, in connection with the said pipe-line, such uncultivated land as may be needed by them for telegraph or telephone stations, or pumping stations, or quarters for line inspectors and staff, having an area of three jaribs for each pumping station, and one and a half jaribs for each of the other stations. It is to be understood that at the expiration of the concession, or of any extension or renewal thereof, the Company shall relinquish every pumping or other station that may be erected on these lands, and shall not be entitled to demand any refund of expenses in this connection. It is agreed that in places where the pipe-line is exposed, guards shall be appointed. Further, that the Shaikh will exert himself to the utmost to pre vent the wilful setting fire to oil in the pipe. In the event of such a contin gency occurring he will endeavour to the utmost of his power to trace and punish the offenders and, if they possess anything, to recover compensation, but the Shaikh does not accept personally any pecuniary liability for loss which may accrue to the Company from this cause, and will not pay compen sation. 4. The Shaikh further undertakes to hire to the Company an area or areas, aggregating ten jaribs at Ahwaz and Nasiri, having frontage on the eastern bank (edge) of the River Karun, for the storage of material, and building of storehouses, and such other buildings as are needed for the Com pany's business, at a rate of one pound sterling per jarib per annum, i .e., that the yearly amount of the rent thereof will be ten pounds sterling. The Company have power to select a site or sites on the eastern edge of the Karun, located opposite the island in the river, upstream from the garden adjacent to the landing place used by steamers plying on the Upper Karun. Should the Company find the ground selected as above, after further examin ation, not suitable for their requirements, they shall have the right to select other sites of the same area and description : and whatever buildings there shall be on these areas shall be left by the Company on the expiry of the lease or of any extension or renewal thereof and they are not entitled to demand any refund of expenses in this connection. 5. In order that the Company may be satisfied that it has received from the Shaikh good and sufficient title to these lands, and that no one in future can put forward any claim in regard to the lands, the Shaikh undertakes for the complete validity thereof to cause this document to be signed and sealed by the elders of his tribes. 6. The Shaikh further undertakes to appoint watchmen for the efficient guarding of the property of the Company in each district situate within his territories which the pipes may be laid or in which the Company's property may be exposed to possible loss : the salary of such watchmen to be paid by the Company themselves. He will furnish the representative of the Company with the names of his own representatives : so that on the representative of the Company on the spot preferring a request, the Shaikh will instruct his representatives to detail trustworthy men for the work. Any changes in the personnel of the representatives of the Shaikh will be intimated to the representative of the Company in due course. 7. So long as the Shaikh guarantees the guards employed by the Com pany, he undertakes to recover any property stolen by the said guards them selves, or by reason of their connivance and in the event of non-recovery, to compensate the Company for the loss sustained. In the case of theft under other circumstances, or of any wilful damage being done to the pipe-line or tanks thereof, or any other property belonging to the Company the Shaikh109 i undertakes to do his utmost to trace the offenders, and in the event of their being identified, should they prove to belong to his jurisdiction, or should they be found therein, to inflict upon them such punishment as will be an example and deterrent to others against the perpetration of such acts : and also a means of making the Company's property respected in his territory. lhat is to say, if it should be ascertained that the culprit or robber is not in the Shaikh's limits and does not belong to his jurisdiction the Shaikh shall not be held responsible. 8. The Shaikh further grants the right to the Company to make all burnt and unburnt bricks and tiles required by them in the lands for the time being in the hands of the Company, and also to erect on the lands occupied by them in accordance with the articles of this Agreement, all buildings, structures and machinery as may be needed by them for the proper execution of their business. The Company undertakes that on the expiry of the concession, or of the period of the extension or renewal thereof, all these lands which have been ac quired from the Shaikh on lease or free of charge, shall be abandoned and shall be given back into the hands of the Shaikh, and the said Company will have no further rights in them. 9. This lease of land, and all the conditions pertaining thereto, shall re main in force for the full period of the concession granted to Mr. W. K. D'Arcy by His Imperial Majesty the Shah of Persia, dated 28th May 1901, and of any extension or renewal thereof. But on the expiration of the ori ginal period, in the event of there being an extension or renewal of the con cession, the rent shall be fixed at 1,500 (fifteen hundred) pounds sterling per annum, payable annually in advance, and the Shaikh shall have no right to demand any further increase. If in consideration of the exigencies of their business, the Company should wish to curtail the period of their lease, in that case twelve calendar (Christian) months' notice of their intention must be given in writing to the Shaikh prior to the termination of the lease. Such notice will be sent to the Shaikh through His Britannic Majesty's Consul at Mohammerah. If the lease should be thus curtailed the Company shall make no claim for refund of money that has been paid in advance on account of rent, and the Shaikh likewise shall make no claim for rent for the unexpired period of the lease. 10. If at any time the Company desire to acquire land on the Karun or Shatt-al-'Arab at Mohammerah or Ahwaz, or any other point anywhere in the country under the Shaikh's jurisdiction for wharves or warehouses for the purposes of their business, the Shaikh undertakes as far as possible to assist the said Company in procuring the said land at favourable rates of lease. It is to be understood that such rent will be paid by the Company themselves. 11. In consideration of the lease of the lands mentioned in paragraph 1, the Company undertake to pay rent at a rate of six hundred and fifty pounds sterling per annum : such rent to be paid in advance every ten years, namely, the amount due to be paid to the Shaikh by drafts of the Company : such pay ment to be made through His Britannic Majesty's Consul at Mohammerah in exchange for the receipt of the Shaikh, The first payment shall be made by the Company within three days of notice being received by the Directors of the completion of this Agreement. 12. The Company on their own part agree not to engage, without the cognizance of the Shaikh, tribesmen for their work, or in any way to interfere in tribal matters. 13. The Company as lessees of these lands agree that all treasure-trove throughout the lands leased to the Company and other lands given under this Agreement, belongs to the Shaikh alone. By ' treasure-trove ' is meant coins, jewellery and objects of antiquity. 14. The Company bind themselves to take into their employ as guards and watchmen such persons as the Shaikh or bis representatives in the various localities may state to be trustworthy : and the Company agree that on receipt from the Shaikh of the expression of wish for the dismissal of any such guard or watchman, they will act in accordance with his request, but only so long as110 support to the enforcement of their authority over the Company's employes is received from the Shaikh, and so long as his assistance in the detection of thieves and punishment of them when detected—if subject to his jurisdiction —^hall be real and effective. 15. The payments to unmounted guards and watchmen engaged from among the Shaikh's men will be made by the Company on the following scale : —fifty krans per month of the Christian calendar without food, or any higher sum that the Company may think necessary : and this sum will be paid by them 15 days subsequent to the end of the month during which it was earned. If the said guards and watchmen do not agree to work for fifty krans per month or the further sum above indicated, then the Company shall have the right to bring guards and watchmen from some other place, but they shall not import them from localities at enmity with the Shaikh, and only so long as the pay of such men shall not be greater than the sum offered to the Shaikh's men. i 16. In the event of a watchman or any employe leaving without giving due notice of one month, it is the rule of the Company that 15 days' pay be for feited, and without exception all native employes are engaged on these terms. 17. The said Company reserve to themselves the right to punish their employes by inflicting fines to the extent of half a month's pay as a maximum, and in the event of the behaviour of the said employes warranting a heavier punishment, they will be handed over to the representative of the Shaikh at the nearest place : and the latter, under the Shaikh's instructions, will use his utmost endeavours to uphold the authority of the Company over the employes and the respect of their property among the people of the district, so avoiding unnecessary trouble to both parties of this Agreement. 18. This Agreement and all the Articles therein are accepted by the Shaikh and admitted to be binding on himself and heirs and successors and on his tribesmen, whoever they may be. 19. This Agreement is considered to be in force from the date on which it is signed, frojn which date the Company become liable for the abovenamed rental. 20. Whenever differences arise between the Shaikh or his representative, and the Company or their representative, such cases shall be adjusted in a friendly and unofficial manner between the parties concerned. Should settle ment not be achieved by this means the matter in question shall be referred to His Britannic Majesty's Consul at Mohammerah, and the latter shall endeav our to settle the matter in dispute personally and informally with the Shaikh, and in the event of their not being able to arrive at a settlement they will refer the case in the same manner to the Resident in the Persian Gulf, whose settle ment shall be considered final.

(Translation hy Lieutenant Wilson) Although the wise of all times and in various tongues have set forth the results ot unity and the profits of concord, and though everyone knows that Governments are formed by concord, and that anarchy results from dissension yet it is to be regretted that this precious jewel (of unity) is in our dear coun try unknown and unpriced and most people high and low care for nothing but their own personal interests. Since now-a-days all the wise men of the world in politics and adminis- nwhv m f have i ound no remed ^ but unit y and have indicated no other medicine to cure our dear country.

APPENDIX XV. Rawlinson's Memorandum on Turko-Persiari Frontier, 1844- Extract fara. 4. —Although the southern limit of the Turkish Empire is declared in Sultan Murad's treaty to be Basrah, and its acknowledged depen dencies, the definition must only be understood as annulling any claim on the part of Persia to the territory in question, for the Turkish authority was not fairly and permanently established in that quarter until A. D. 1688, 30 years after the conclusion of the treaty. Great uncertainty also attaches to the extent of territory which was de^ pendent upon Basrah at the precise period of the Treaty, from the time of Sultan Selim to the time of Sultan Murad, the limits of the Pashahc being greater or less according to the individual power of the chiefs who reigned there I think there can be no doubt, however, that the immediate banks of the Shatt-al-'Arab were always under the rule of Basrah, the ancient towns ot Mufelleh and Mader which were invariably ranked among the dependencies of Basrah appear to have been on the left bank of the river near the northern positions of Mohammerah and Girdalan, and when the Jihan Nama was writ- ten shortly after the institution of the Pashahc of Basrah not 0^ were the forts on either bank of the Shaft under that Government, theJTurk s power had been extended to the lands of Gaban situated far to the eastward, on the old bed of the Karun. The following is the description given of Qubban m the Jihan Mama under the head of Basrah :— . ' Qaleh Qubban lies on the side of Khuzistan being the extreme position of the Turkish Government in that direction. It consists of a fort built upon a river near the point of its disemtogue- ment in the Persian Gulf, and to reach this fort from Qa e Jadideh (on the island of Abbadan near the mouth of Ae Shatt) it is necessary to cross the Karun, (by this must te meant the Bahmanshir) the intervening tract being entnely desert. -Above Qubban are three other forts c ' ose f ^Ike'fiow'ng upon Persia, in the neighbourhood of which isalake now g down from the Karun and falling into the Persian Gulf, Md lands which lie between the course of this lake a constitute the territory of Qubban, enclosed on all sides by water like an island.' The best evidence peobably ™ , ? ieh is a h So ^ the lands are duly registered.
