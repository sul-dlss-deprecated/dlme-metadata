Our present monitoring staff consists of locally engaged listeners who do their best but results are not reliable. If enemy broadcasts are to be countered, it is essential that they should be taken down verbatim. Monitoring is also urgently required for securing broadcast talks and news for publication or broadcasts in Iren,, It should also be possible to meet Jerusalem's request for scripts for use in Sharq aladah. Further, British military authorities are much exercised at the absence of sources of reliable news for troops,^ both British and Indian. I am very anxious to do what I can to help them, and I nopo that with the new Government, it will be possible to induce the Bagdad broadcasting station to use the material .supplied by this Embassy. It is clear, therefore , that our monitoring system must be made efficient. There is only one method whereby that can be done, which is to employ apparatus now used by the British Broadcasting Corporation and Information Board in India. The machine is known as 'Telediphone'. The British Broadcasting Corporation will, no doubt, furnish details. Major Inglis, who was for seven years national manager of the British Broadcasting Corporation, is now in Bagdad, Since the beginning of the war he has been at Simla and Delhi, where he inaugurated a monitoring system exactly similar to that used by the British Broadcasting Corporation. I am making enquiries through him regarding the necessary apparatus. It can probably be obtained in India at a cost of approximately £800 sterling. When the machine is [? grp&lt;&gt; omitted ? install]ed, an expert radio mechanic is locally available to maintain it. The military authorities, like myself, regard the provision of a news gathering centre which will be absolutely reliable and entirely indpendent of Iraqi Government as of increasing importance* I hope therefore that I may receive early sanction for its provision.SECRET fo I hi}, l D E O Y P H E H OS’ g B L B O B A M .
