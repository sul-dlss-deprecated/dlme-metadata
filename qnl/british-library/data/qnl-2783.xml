Downing Street, 1st February 1932. Sir, Recent events in Saudi Aj&amp;ia, more particularly the Ibn Rifada incursion and the revolt in Asir, have suggested the desirability of reviewing the position generally, and it seems convenient to take this opportunity of re-stating the main lines of the policy which His Majesty^ Government in the United King dom are pursuing in regard to Arabian affairs, with special reference to Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Trans-Jordan. 2. Briefly, this policy may be described as the maintenance of the status quo; and His Majesty’s Government have thus to follow two distinct lines of action - (a) support of the regime of Ibn Saud as King of Saudi Arabia, and (b) support of the Hashimite regime in Iraq and Trans- J ordan• 3. In both cases international relations are involved* and it may be useful firsTto recapitulate the more important instruments which govern the position. Saudi Arabia . • His Majesty the King has recognised Ibn Saud as King of the Hejaz and of Nejd and its Dependencies (now known as Saudi Arabia) by the treaty signed at Jedda on the 20th May, 1927, and the relations established by that treaty involve certain mutual obligations, notably, by Article 2, each of the High Contracting Parties undertakes to maintain good relations with/ HIGH COMMISSIONER, LIEUTENANT GENERAL, SIR A.G.tfAUCHOPS, K.C.B. ,C.M.G.,0.1 .E.,D.3.0., etc., etc., etc. » »\ \ r &gt; with the other and to endeavour by ail the means at his disposal to prevent his territories being used as a base for unlawful activities directed against peace and tranquility in the territories of the other party* Iraq * The relations between His Majesty’s Government and Iraq will be governed until 1957 or longer by the Treaty o± 30th June, 1930, which came into force upon the entry of Iraq into the eague of Nations as an independent State in October,1932* The High Contracting Parties undertake that, without prejudice to obligations under the Covenant and the Treaty for the Renunciation x&gt;f &gt;.Var, in the event of either of tnem becoming engaged in war, the other will immediately come to his aid. The assistance which His Majesty’s Government are to render to Iraq does not extend to the maintenance of internal order, but it is recognised that the protection of the essential communica tions of His Majesty’s Government is in the common interest of both parties. In matters of foreign policy which may affect their common interests the High Contracting Parties agree to full and frank consultation. His Majesty’s Ambassador at Baghdad, and his successors, are to enjoy precedence in relation to the representatives of other powers. Iraq undertakes that when in need of the services of foreign officials she will normally engage British subjects, and that for the purpose of military instruction only British subjects will oe engaged. Trans-J ordan . The relations between His Majesty’s Government and the are determined by the Agreement ma.de ofitvyeen His Majesty the King and His Highness in February,1928, the ratifications of/of which were exchanged on the 31st October, 1929, iull responsibility is accepted by His Majesty as mandatory for Trans-Jordan; and by Article 5 of the Agreement, the Amir agrees to be guided by the advice of His Majesty in all matters concerning foreign relations of brans—Jordan &lt;ns well a in all matters affecting the international and financial obligations and interests of His Majesty in respect of Trans-Jordan. 4. The direct relations between Saudi Arabia and Iraq are governed by various instruments, notably the Muhammara 'Convention of 5th May,1922; the Bahra Agreement of 1st Novem ber, 1925; and the Treaty of Friendship and Bon Voisinage and the Extradition Treaty of 1931. The Hadda Agreement of the 2nd November,1925, defines “'the frontier between Nejd and Trans-Jordan and makes provision for the settlement of certain questions connected with the frontier, with a view to promoting friendly relations between the two countries. No definite agreement has been reached with the Government of Saudi Arabia as to the definition of tue frontier between Hejaz and Trans-Jordan, but, by the exchange of notes appended to the Treaty of Jedda, King Ibn Saud has expressed his willingness to maintain the status quo in the Ma 1 an-Aqaba district and not to interfere in its administration until favourable circumstances will permit a final settlement of the question. 5. In conformity with the general policy of His Majesty’s Government, a further stage will have been reached in the process of establishing these international relations on a regular basis when effect has been given to the proposed mutual recognition between Ibn Saud as King oi Saudi Arabia, and Abdullah as Amir of the State of Trans-Jordan, which, it is c o nt emp la t ed/—— ——i Hi contemplated, will be followed by the conclusion of a Treaty of Friendship between the two countries. 6. Turning now to another aspect of the matter, the following are the chief reasons which have influenced His Majesty’s Government in giving their support to the maintenance of Ibn Saud’s regime in Saudi Arabiai- (r) Having regard to the great concern to His Majesty s Government of the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf, to their mandatory responsibility for Trans-Jordan and their special interests in Iraq, Kuwait and Bahrain, it has been recognised that it is of great advantage to His Majesty’s Government that the main area of the Arabian Hen insula should be undei a more or less ordered government with which they can maintain normal diplomatic relations and of importance that those relations should be of a friendly character. (b) Only by the establishment of s uch an ordered government in Arabia can the saiety and gooci treatment of Moslem pilgrims, many of whom are British subjects, or under British protection, be ensured. (c) tfere relations between His Majesty’s Government and King Ibn Baud not of a friendly character, he might well exert himself to absorb Kuwait^ interfere in the affairs of Bahrain and even attempt to obtain an influence over the Trucial Shaikhdoms. There have been occasions! indications that some at least of the Trucial Shaikhs would not be un responsive. (d) His Majesty’s Government would view with concern the establishment of Soviet influence in Arabia. King Ibn Saud has shown himself to be of the same view and lor tnis reason merits support. When recently His Majesty’s Govern ment were unable to comply with King Ibn Baud’s request for a loan, he informed them that he might be obliged, though most reluctant ly/-5- reluctantly, to accept Soviet offers of financial assistance, lere the relations between His Majesty’s Government and him to deteriorate, he might be readier to accept the advances oi the Soviet Government. 7. As regards the support given to the Hashimite family in Iraq and Trans-Jordan, His Majesty’s Government have been influenced by the following considerationst- (a) His Majesty’s Government recognise that they remain under special obligations to the Hashimites arising from the part played by the latter in the war against Turkey. (b) King ^eisal and the Amir Abdullah have shown themselves to be well-disposed to His Majesty’s Government. It is not necessary to enter into detail, but two recent cases in which the latter has, by his co-operation, materially assisted His Majesty’s Government are the Druse rebellion and the disturbances in Palestine in 1929. (c) His Majesty’s Government have maintained their support of the Hashimites for many years, and there is nothing which in their view suggests the desirability of any change in a policy to which they are deeply committed. On the contrary, there are special relations with Iraq, arising out of the Treaty of Alliance, which involve continued support; while in the case of Trans-Jordan, His Majesty’s Government have a special responsibility, as the mandatory power, to support the regime which has been set up in that country under their direct protection. (d) Sven if His Majesty’s Government had grounds for serious dissatisfaction, there is no obvious alternative to the Hashimites as rulers in Iraq or Trans-Jordan. 8. The possibility is recognised that the kingdom of Ibn Saud may break up on his death, but it would not be to the advantage/- 6 - advantage of His Majesty’s Government to do anything to fasten its disruption. On the contrary, it is to their interest to do all that they can to maintain good relations with Saudi Arabia and to support Ibn Saud as ruler of a united kingdom. Neverthe less, account must be taken of the mutual animosity between Ibn Saud and the Hashimite family resulting from past events, which cannot be expected entirely to disappear eve n as a result of the establishment of relations on the basis of m utual recognition and treaites of friendship. The possibility of the continuance of disputes and of conflicting interests must be accepted, and the full reconciliation of the two complemen tary aspects of the policy of His Majesty’s Government presents a problem, the solution of which is not without difficulty. Support of Ibn Baud’s regime in Saudi Arabia, cannot be given at the expense of support of the Hashimite rulers in their own territories, and His Majesty’s Government must take full account of the repercussions likely to be produced in teni- tories over which they exercise mandatory responsicility or towards which they stand in special relations. 9 # Despite, however, the existence of these difficulties, no question has arisen, nor does the question now arise, of choosing bs between Ibn Saud and the Ilashimite xamxly, or of subordinating the interests of one to the other. If events should, unhappily, lead to that, a new situation would be created in which the whole position would have to be carefully reviewed. It is not suggested that there is likelihood of His Majesty’s Government being faced with such a dilemma. Latterly, however, some anxiety has been caused in respect of relations between Trans-Jordan and Saudi hraoia, owing to the evidence of widespread and continuous intrigues against the Saudi/-7- Saudi regime whicn are believed to have been conducted, in part at least, within Trans-Jordan itself. It is the fact that the Amir has conformed all his official acts to the requests made to him in connect ion with the situation created by those intrigues. But there are many indications that he knew of these intrigues, even supposing that he did not encourage them, and it seems not unlikely that other persons have actively engaged in the conspiracy, and have made use of the Amir or of his name, either with or without his acquiescence, for the furtherance of subversive activities against Ibn Saud, In consequence, a difficult, and perhaps even serious, situation has threatened to develop. 10, Much has been done already, at yo r instance, by the authorities in Trans-Jordan and Palestine to prevent those territories from being used as a base for improper activities against the Baudi regime. Effective co-operation in Trans jordan played an important part in the fnustration of the Ibn Rifada revolt. This has been followed by the explusion of an important section of the disaffected Beni Atiya, and by the exclusion from both Palestine and Trans-Jordan of various suspects• Moreover, it is to be hoped that the mutual recognition of the Amir Abdullah and King Ibn Saud and the proposed treaty will materially improve matters. The fact remains, however, that the existence of anti-Seudi intrigue is contrary to the wishes and the interests of His Majesty’s Government; and further, having regard to their treaty xb obligations, and in particulrr those embodied in Article 2 of the Treaty of Jedda, the credit of His Majesty's Government will be at stake if such intrigues are conducted in territory for which they are responsible. In view of the past history of Saudi Arabia, and having regard to Arab mentality, it is recognised that it is hardly to be hoped that intrigue against the/- 8 - / the Saudi regime in territories under Hashimite rule or influence can be completely stopped; but His Majesty’s CrOTernment consider it a definite obligation to take all measures possible to restrict this kind of activity within limits which will not constitute a threat to the stability of the Saudi regime or expose His Majesty’s Government to charges of indifference, if not of actual toleration. it is of course a corollary of this policy that Ibn Saud should be required to maintain a correct attitude towards his Hashimite neighbours. 11. I should be glad if, taking the foregoing considerations into account, you will revise the position, with special refer ence to Trans-Jordan, in the light of all the information available, and report what further steps can, in your opinion, be taken (l) for restricting anti-Saudi intrigue, and, in so far as it may be impossible to prevent it, at least for neutralising its effect; and (2) generally for promoting the establishment of better relations between Trans-Jordan and Saudi Arabia. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient, humble servant, (Sgd.) 2. CUKLIFFE-LISTER. • O a . . .THE FUTURE Off ARABIA - ^ ***** General Remarks . The past history of Arabia is that of petty warring Shaikhs, and raid an encounter-raid of Bedouin tribes, a perpetual state of anarchy hardly conceivable elsewhere, but which has suited the conditions of Arabia well enough, and has indeed been the out come of these very conditions. Even in the time of Mohammed, and just after, Ara ia was far from being united, and during the 130$ centuries which have elapsed since then has only been under one rule, and even bow by no means entirely, for a period of six years i.e.from 1925, when Bin Saud took the Hedjaz from the Hashimites, up to the present time. 2. Arabia itself (if one draws its northern boundary from the Gulf of Akaba to Basrah) is little more than a gigantic desert, some of it fit for pasture, some of it merely sand, with scattered oasfcs here and there in which are some small towns, Riadh the most important containing probably not much more than 10,000 inhabitants The country is thus definitely pastoral and primitive. Its population is unknown, but has been guessed at as from 6-8 millions, of which a large p:oportion is composed of wandering Bedouin tribes whose mentality, and way of life, has altered little in the past three thousand yea's except that they now wage their desert warfare with rifles in place of swords and lances. It has no rivers, scanty rainfall, no manufactures, sparse agriculture. There are only two towns, Mecca and Jedda, in the v/hole country which can be called ’cities,’ and both depend for their existence not on comraercial factors as cities do elsewhere b t on the fact that the first named is a place of pilgrimage for the Moslem world. If the pilgrimage for any reason were to cease Mecca and J edda/5./ - 2 - Jedda would lose their principal reason for existence. 3. The Arab himself, the peculiar inhabitant of this peculiar country, has certain good qualities, is likeable enough, and even at times attractive. But he is a convinced individualist, as one would expect from his environment. Any sort of authority is irksome to him; the most he will tolerate is that of his Shaikh, and even this grudgingly and generally only when it suits himself. Of any sort of combined and sustained co-operation whether for peace or war he is normally quite incapable, though occasionally influenced by religious fanaticism and under a leader of genius such as Bin Saud he can work with his fellows for a few years towards a common end. Raiding - an economic necessity ? 4. All these are platitudes of course but they serve to bring the country into perspective, and while on the subject of Arabian characteristics a short comment ntiy be made on the phenomenon of the ghazzu or raid which plays such a part in life in Arabia, and which is the cause of not a little anxiety to her neighbours. These raids are of two kinds - internal and external. It has often been pointed out by writers on Arabia that the former - which are conducted under certain conventions, preventing any excess of blood shed - are in the nature of a sport, with prizes in the shape of loot, corresponding to our western sports and games, in f P ct practically the only sport with which the Arabian can enliven his otherwise somewhat monotonous exis^nce. (as a side issue it may be noted that the Wahabis have of late introduced an element of savagery into these raids quite unknown before in Arabia). There is also the prestige attached to the successful raider, and the Arab - like other folk - is by no means indifferent to the admiration of his fellowmen - and women. The further interesting point has also been made, which is not by any means so obvious, that these raids may really fulfil an economic purpose by providing - if in a wasteful way - lor the redistribution of stock between the tribes.5. As for the external raids, these are made into what has been called the 'Fertile Crescent',i.e. ’Iraq, Palestine, and Syria, and follow the tradition of thousands of years that the hungry ’desert* shall fill its stomach from the well-fed ’sown’, thus also fulfilling an economic law, in fact the oldest extant: ' That he shall take who has the power, ' And he shall hold who can.' 6. Economic necessity is a sharp spur, and to the extent that raids are due to this cause, they must be considered as all the more formidable. That there are strong impulses behind the raids is shown by the fact that a fairly strict control on the part of Bin Saud, and adequate defence measures on the part of the authorities in ’Iraq, Palestine, and Trans-Jordan, have failed to put a stop to these incursions , even though they have been always successfully repelled. Present position of Bin Saud . 7. The position is, therefore, that for his own purposes - to weld his kingdom together - Bin Saud has laid a ban on internal raiding, and for the sake of his foreign relations - with-Great Britain and France the two Powers principally concerned - has prevented to a certain extent external raiding. It is these bans which have largely contributed to his unpopularity with his of Wahabi followers, and which were for instance one/the underlying causes of the serious rebellion against him in the winter of 1929-30 by Faisal Dawish. The /ahabi would doubtless welcome a cessation of internal bickering in return for the promise of a glorious combined first-class raid on the Fertile Crescent. But when he is forbidden to do either he is - naturally enough - dis contented and rebellious. In fact Bin Saud in being compelled,-4- owing to various causes, to stop raiding of all sorts is - from one point of view - really sitting on the Arabian safety-valve, economical and psychological, and if this view is correct it would seem only a matter of time beiore the engine blows up. Arab ia without Bin Saud. 8. With regard to the future of Arabia without Bin Saud: this is at least as an important a consideration as the present of Arabia with him. In fact.the real test of Bin Baud’s success will only come when he disappears from the scene, and it is proved whether he lias left behind him a stable kingdom or - like so many Oriental rulers before him - merely a temporary creation which will collapse when deprived of his presence. 9. /■■ consideration of Bin Baud’s disappearance from the Arabian scene is of course far from being academic. He is now 55 years old, and must one day die a natural death. Or he may ^ die an unnatural death ary day - he has many enemies, or as he ✓ gets older his grip may loosen, or he may fall from power pre maturely. Recent despatches from Sir Andrew Ryan, who of course knows more about him than anybody else, indicate that his position is far from secure. (Vide Jedda despatch Ho.200 of 28th May 1931 to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Poreign Affairs). Briefly, he is trying to ride two horses, or shall we say two camels ? , at once, and is losing control of both. he is not Jahabi enough for the /ahabis, and yet too V/ahabi for the hedjazi. lie has risen to power by the support of a primitive, fanatical and warlike sect, whose principal aim in life is to loot and kill the unbeliever,i.e. any non-Wahabi, but is for various reasons - see para 7 above for instance - losing their support, while he has entirely failed - see para 12 below - to pain the allegiance of his non-Yahabi subjects. The financial condition of his kingdom, vide for instance Jedda despatch H£).253 of 1st July 1931 to/to His Majesty 1 s Principal Secretary of State for Poreign Affairs, is parlous in the extreme. In fact peace in Arabia may not even depend upon the pressure of Bin Saud. Should his control on the Hedjaz and over Nejd, the one acting on the other, weaken apprecia bly, should in fact his position become desperate, there is always one course which he could adopt, and which would at any rate rally the tfahabi elements behind him: to raise his war-stanaard, and on some pretext or other, sweep down at the head of a host of the Faithful on ’Iraq, Syria, or Palestine. This contingency is, of course, unlikely, but not perhaps beyond the bounds of all possibility. In fact during the critical times of February and March 1928, when some of/his tribes broke loose from his territory and raided ’ I aq, it seemed po ssible for a brief period that he might be forced by his rebellious subjects to take this hazardous step. Eventualities on disappearance of Bin Saud . 10. As for the inevitable time when Bin Saud must dis appear from the scene, for one cause or another, one of three eventualities will arise:- (a) A successor will take his place, who will be able to control Hedjaz aad Nejd as Bin Saud is doing at present, and peace will continue. Who his successor may be is doubtful. His eldest son, Amir Saud, is the Grown Prince, and Heir Apparent, but Arabs think v ry little of primogeniture, and cling to the older and more violent tradition of ’’let the best man win” provided generally that the best man belongs to the Shaikhly fami ly. (b) The successor will be unable to control the kingdom, ana keep the peace. In order to secure his position at home he will try the expedient of a war abroad, ( a tradition al policy in the East, its last exponent being Amanullah of Afghanistan, and by no means unknown in Europe until modern times), will throw his lot in with the war party - the »ahafci s and /mm n - 6 - and will launch attacks on the surrounding unbelievers, (c) No successor will appear with shoulders broad enough to carry the abba of Bin 5a &lt;d, his kingdom will disintegrate, and Arabia will relapse once more into her accustomed anarchy, a feature of which will certainly be sporadic raids into the Fertile Crescent, not only by Vahabi tribes proper, but by all those who - tlahabi or not - have been included in his territory and kept under his control. /*s 11. Of these three eventualities if (a) materializes then Arabia will continue as at present and no further comments are necessary. Loss bf Hed.ictz u.v v/ahabis . 12. Unfortunately, however, it seems much more likely that either (b) or (c) or a combination of both will arise. '/hat will happen in the Hedjaz in either event is not the immediate concern of the Indian Government, from whose point of view this Note is written,but the Wahabis will probably lose it. They only acquired it by the sword, are disliked - if not detested - by the local inhabitants, and have no roots in the country. With Nejd m ferment, and the tribes * up* either raiding each other, or raiding into the Fertile Crescent, it is difficult to see how Wahabi rule can be maintained in far-away iiedjaz. As in the previous century the Wahabis, after a period of occupation of the Hedjaz, will most likely withdraw. For Bin Saud*s is not of course the first Nejdi ’raid’ into the Hedjrz. In 1802 the Y/ahabis took Taif and massacred the inhabitants, men, women, and children, exactly as they did a century and a quarter later in 1924-25. In 1805 they took Mecca, in 1804 Medina, and as a repetition of history it is interesting to note that certain features of their rule then, good and bad, tranquility/-7- &lt;—\ to tranquility was amongst the former, are in evidence to-day. (dee Lorimer* s Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf Yol.l Part l.Hidtorical ;• Their occupation continued until 1815, i.e. about 9 years, when they were expelled by Hohammed Ali, Pasiia of hgypt, acting under orders of the Sultan of Turkey. Palestine. Trains-Jordan, and Iraq . 13. As for Palestine, Trans-2 or dan, and Syria, (Syria of course will likewise have difficulties, but tnose will be the concern of the French), under eventualities lb) and 10) the aut iorities of these areas will undoubtedly have to face a serious crisis in the shape of raids and unrest. The seriousness of the crisis will lie, not in the danger of any particular raid but in the cumulative effect of the strain and expense entailed by meeting an indefinite number of such incursions spread over a prolonged period. For once the controlling hand of Bin Saud is lost, on the assumption that his successor cannot fill this place it is imposaiu to say now Inng it will be before another controlling authority will arise, and in the meantime raids will presumably continue. On the North 7 est Frontier in India where the same situation exists, only that there it is not the case of the ’desert 1 and the * sown’ but of the similar age-long feud between the ’mountain eer’ and the ’lowlander’, the Government jf India have tackled the situation by a forward policy, which the taking over of certain tribdl tracts and the building up of roads will at the same time put important strategic areas in our hands, bring the tribes more under our authority, and by the development of such resources as he possesses lead tile tribesman gradually into peaceful ways. But a policy which is practicable for a settled population of mountaineers living in villages cannot obviously be a.plied to Bedouins scattered over huge areas of desert.14. It may, - 8 - 14. It may, however, be practicable to build posts at important wells and so deny them to raiders, and to organize the tribes of threatened areas so that they can assist in their own defence. Coincident with this it might be found expedient to resuscitate if possible the Shammar Amirate of Ibn Rashid at Hail &lt; a point of considerable strate ical importance in desert warfare in northern Arabia - and thus form a barrier against Jahabi incursions from the South. At one time indeed, and not so long ago, it was the Ibn Rashid and not the Bin Sahd of the day' who was Arabia’s big man. In 1888, for instance, Mohammed bin Abdullah ibn Rashid captured the Wahabi capital of Riadh and took its ruler a prisoner to Hail, under whose rule Southern as well as Northern Neid remained for some 14 years till the taking of Riadh by the present Bin Saud in 1902. Prom then on up to 1914 the Turkish Administration of ’Iraq found in the rulers of Kail, even though the Shammar power had weakened, useful allies against tne rising tide of Yahabism. (On tne outbreak of war Ibn Rashid declared for the Turks, but Hail was not taken by Bin Saud, and Jabal Shamnar annexed to Rejd until 1921). Air Route and Pipe Line . 15 # As far as Basrah the Air Route should not be affected by tribal disturbances in Arabia. With regard to the Persian Gulf Section. At the moment of writing this Note (September 1931) it has not been settled whether the Air Route shall run along the Northern or Southern shores of the Persian Gulf. If the former the Air Route in the Persian Gulf Section wixl in no way be afiected by events in Arabia. If the latter then the remarks in para 17 below are relevant. In view of tne fact that flying boats will be used no trouble need be anticipated up to and including Bahrain. At Ras-al-Khairaah, the next halting place, however, if the Trucial Coast is infected with the general unrest consequent upon the break-down/17./ -9- break-down of central control in Nejd, some trouble and perhaps opposition to the continuance of the route, may be expected. The safe-guarding of the projected Pipe Lise and railway from ’Iraq to the Mediterranean will be a cause of some anxiety to the autho rities concerned. It is true that the line will run well Porth of Arabia proper, but anarchy at the centre in Pejd will create unrest beyond the frontiers, just as a stone dropped in the middle of a pond will send ripples far and wide. Defence of ’Iraq. 16. For Palestine and Trans-Jordan the Government of India is in no way responsible, and Syria is under a French Mandate. If assistance is required for the defence of the two first named it will be forthcoming from areas unconnected with India - hgypt or perhaps England. Nor is the Indian Government in any way responsible for ’Iraq either now or next year when it will become an independent country. But though independent Iraq will still,~ under her treaty with Great Britain, have claims on the armed assistance of His Majesty’s Government in case of foreign invasion. Should whatever F..A.F.elements left in Iraq, with the ’Iraqi forces, be sufficient to repel the series of raids foreshadowed above - well and good. If, however,this should not prove the case, (and of course it is quite outside the scope of this Note to give any opinion on this point), and military assistance from outside is required, it seems obvious that the Indian Government will be appealed to as the nearest and most convenient area from which such assistance can be supplied - especially if this assistance is required in a hurry. The Persian Gulf.The Persian Golf. 17* In this quarter the Indian Government has uf course certain responsiDilities which will be increased by tne dis- a :j pear a nee of* Bin baud* To take the various areas in turn* The sbat &gt;tate is remote from i^ejd and has had little to do with Bin baud, though his ancestors claimed sovereignty over it, and round aoout 1812 over-ran part of 'Oman, and succeeded in converting the Bani ~ou Ali, oi Jaalan, (near bur), wnp remain v^anabi to this day* Probably encroachments on Baraimi, a point of some local strategical importance from which the Batineh coast of 'Oman can be threatened on one side, ana the Trucial Coast on the other, may be expected. The Shaikhs of the Trucial Coast , when pressed by us to do something they don't want, have been known to throw out dark hints that they may be compelied to seek the assistance of Bin baud, although in practice they ha ve little to do with him. On his disappearance should some local enter prising Shaikh inake himself an independent Amir of Hasa a certain amount of interference of the latter kjs in Trucial coast affairs, and consequent unrest may follow, as well as in ^atar. ra i n , bei g an island, will be safe from «/ahabi incursions, but will doubtless suffer commercially. At present a trade of some proportion goes on between the island and the mainland, both for the local needs of the province of Hasa, and for hej d - especially since Bin Sa d has 'blockaded* Kuwait. /ith Hejd and Hasa relapsed into anarchy this trade will of course decrease appreciably. On the other hand various problems connected with Bin baud and Bahrain, and the intrigues of his agents - the ^uaaabis .. will be automatically solved. On the whole therefore in areas so far reviewed in the Persian Gulf the disappearance of Bin baud Irom the Ambian scene, while causing some local unrestf'l'b) - 11 - along x.he Arabian coast, will most probably not entaxl an,y commitments or interference, on the part of the Government of India except perhaps in connection with the Air Route (see paragraph loj. The remaining area to be considered, howeve^ stands on a difierent footing. 18. Kuwait ” an independent Arab State, under British protec tion, but not a British Protectorate' (see P.G.13, page 73, para graph 2), His Majesty’s Government are pledged to protect against foreign aggression, and in time oi need the actual implements of this responsibility would - if military assistance .vere required most probably fall on the Indian Government. During the crisis of 1928 - already referred to in paragraph 9-3 ships of the Persian Gulf Givision were stationed off Kuwait, landing parties were diseraoarked, a temporary air base was established on shore, and a flight of aeroplanes and a detachment of armoured cars irom * Iraq were sent to tne town. it was generally accepted that this was sufficient to defend the town from attacks cy tribesmen with out artillery. At the same time it was pointed out by the uenior Haval Officer, Persian Gulf Division, to the Resident that the whole of his Division was thus immobilized at Kuwait and unable to perform its duties elsewhere, and that if a garrison were required at Kuwait for an extended period this duty would best be performed by a battalion of Infantry supported by artillery or ship-guns. Under the conditions now envisaged, i.e. a collapse of Bin Gaud’s kingdom and an irruption ol Arabian tribes cvei the frontiers, first - a garrison might be required at Kuwait for a considerable period, and second - the Royal Air Force might have their hands too full in defending 'Iraq to detail aeroplanes oi cars for the defence of Kuwait. 19. In this case the defence of Kuwait would depend on the battalion of Infantry and y.rtillery, both presumably irom India, c in/in lieu of the latter ships guns, which would mean the ’tying up’ of the Persian Gulf .Division - or part of it - at Kuwait, when it migiit be needed to cope with troubles elsewhere on the i’rucial coast for example. Apparently not much assistance can oe expected from Shaikh Ahmad (of Kuwait) himself. Airing the crisis it was proposed that he should purchase armoured cars, but this idea was finally abandoned for financial reasons. He has apparently little I faith in the martial qualities of his Kuwaitis. In a conversation with Colonel iiicKson, Political Agent, Kuwait, in August 1929, and wit : Colonel Biscoe in Jecember of the same year, he pointed out that the real fighting strength oh which Kuwait had always depended was the Mutair, Ajman, and Awazim tribes which had been taken away from him and given by us to ^in Baud in 1922 b$t the Treaty of Ujair. In nddition to this his State has been u reatly impoverished by the blockade imposed by Bin Saud for the last 8 years. This he feels oil the more acutely as it was his great uncle the famous Shaikh Mubarak who offered asyxum to Bin Saua when an exile and a fugitive, who actually took the field with the ahabi leader on a hazardous and unsuccessful venture into Southern ttejd, and to wnose backing and encouragement Bin Baud’s final and successful bid for power in 1902 was not a little due. Moreover when Shaikh Ahmad succeeded to the Shaikhship in 1921 he continued Mubarak’s policy towards Bin Saud, sending that individual who was then operating against Hail (see paragraph 14 above) Rs.1,60,000 in cash and 3,000 camel loads of supplies. Much later too, only a T few years ago in the winter of 1929-30, it was the refusal of the haikh, at our request, to allow Bin Dav/ish and his fellow dissidents to base themselves in Kuwait, or get supplies from it, that enabled Bin Saud to crush the rebellion. SUMMARY . Arabia a primitive and pastural country is little more than a gigantic desert (paragraphs 1-3), and its most note worthy phenomenon, the f -ha^zu or raid, internal and externa^, maymay well be partly caused by economic necessity (paragraphs 4-6)• Bin :iaud’s posit ion spears at present lor various reasons far from s trong (paragraph 7), and in any case the real test of his work will cane when he disappears from tne scene (paragraph 8), That his control over Arabia must one day cease is of course obvious, and this may possibly occur before his death (paragraph 9). /hen he finally disap ears (paragraph 10} Arabia will probably dissolve in chaos and the Wahabis will lose Hedjaz (paragraph 12), while there will be a prolonged series of raids on Palestine, ?r.'-ns-Jordan and ’ Iraq, (parag aph 13), against which ix. mrg be practicable to resuscitate the dhammar confederacy under the Ibn Rashids of Hail, (paragrapn :4 . It is not likely that the Imperial Airways Route will be interfered with, but the protection of the projected ’Iraq- Mediterranean pipi-line and railway may cause some anxiety (para graph 15). The Indian Government may ce called upon to assist in the defence of ’Iraq (paragraph 16), and more particularly of Kuwait (paragraph 18), but along the rest of the Arab coast of the Persian Gulf they will probably not oe involved in any new commitments (paragraph 18 17). September 1931. sd/- T. G. F. ***--**#-——- - &gt;5 P.S. to Note, dated Septeniber 1931, on THE FUTURE OF ARABIA. /v During a recent visit to Kuwait the question came up in conversation between Colonel Dickson, the Shaikh, and myself of what effect Ibn Saud’s death, or fall from power, would have on Kuwait. (Rumours - later proved to be unfounded - of the severe defeat of Ibn Baud’s forces in /sir were then current). The Shaikh was of opinion that in either of these events Kuwait would ’come to its own’. The Blockade would cease, and tribes such as the Ajraan and Mutair, formerly owing allegiance to Kuwait, but now under Ibn Saud, would once more turn to him (the Shaikh). Colonel D.ckson agreed with these views. If this actually proves to be the esse, then the remarks made in paragraph 13 of my Note of September 1931 will have to be modified. It is possible that the Shaikh, provided with money and arms by us, could look after himself and h s territory, without further assistance, though doubtless some armoured cars, if available, would be very useful. The Shaikh was of opinion, with which 'olonel Dickson and I heartily concurred, that on Ibn Baud’s death Arabia would probably become one vast Donnybrook Fair, the tribes raiding and counter raiding eacn other in the good old way. The Shaikh, however, did not think that raids would be made across the Iraq frontiers, but would be confined to tribal territory outside it. Both Colonel Dickson and I disagreed with tihis, and considered that once Ibn Saud’s controljwas removed the tribes would be unable to resist the temptation to see what loot they could raise out of Iraq, and that some raiding across the frontier at all events would take place. sd/- T.C.F.

While he will understand that it is contrary to the policy . of His Majesty's Government to enter in alliances save in exceptional cases, such as the 'Iraq treaty, which takes the place of previous existing obligations, he may be assured that short of this His Majesty's Government would welcome a strengthening of ties of friendship between the two governments and are always ready for general conversa tions on outstanding questions with this object in view. Such general conversations would naturally include discus sions in a friendly spirit of the two major questions,viz: 1. The 1913-14 Line and 2. Blockade of Kuwait, which requires settle ment ?but relations between Saudi Government and His Majesty's Government can be considered entirely smooth and/- 2 - and satisfactory. 3. As regards 1 you may inform Ibn Saud that if he will cease to contest the undoubted validity in international law of the 1913-14 line His Majesty's Government will be prepared, as in the earlier case of Kuwait, to consider sympathetically and to authorise you to discuss on your return suggest that now that his achievements have brought his country into the circle of fully independent and properly constituted States he cannot ?merely seek to set aside generally accented principles of international law which govern relations between such&amp;tates. It would be impossible for His Majesty's Govern ment to discuss the boundary question on any other basis. 4. As regards 2 you should merely indicate that the obligations of His Majesty's Government towards the Shaikh make it impossible to consider their relations with Ibn Saud as entirely satisfactory until some method is found of alleviating the damaging effects of the blockade upon the Shaikhdom. Should the King raise the question of the Shaikh's claims (regarding which position has not yet been cleared up with Shaikh) you may say that His Majesty's Government agree that this matter must be settled also. 5.

AMRICA AND /JR ART A Mr, S.R. Jordan His Majesty’s Minister at Jeddah arrived by air from Ibn Saud's shooting camp near A1 Rammah accompanied by Mr. Mann and Shaikh Yousuf Yasseen on the 28th March 1944. The plane refuelled and left after a halt of 3/4 of an hour for Jeddah. 2. I was informed of Mr. Jordan’s arrival and immediately went to Muharraq aerodrome to see him. The conversation for the most part was of little interest but just before the plane took off I had the opportunity for a few minutes private conver sation with Mr. Jordan. He informed me that the Cairo Con ference had been cancelled, that Nahas Pasha had suggested that Saudi Arabia, the Yemen, and Egypt shall stand together and apart from Iraq Ac., and that Ibn Saud had agreed. He also told me that there was a serious difference of opinion between Nuri Syed and Nahas Pasha, and that Ibn Saud was resisting American attempts at domination in Saudi Arabia and had recently dismissed Najib Saleh as not only had he acquired over £ 250,000 during the last two years but he was philandering with the Americans and had definitely come under their influence. Mr. Jordan also said that Ibn Saud had asked for a British financial adviser and for a British Military mission and that quite recently he had refused an American request to construct landing grounds at Jeddah, Riyadh, and Dhahran. It was Mr. Jordan’s opinion that American gaucherie was doing much to increase the Arabs’ preference for the British though as far as Ibn Saud was concerned his pro-British feelings were too deep rooted to be affected one way or the other by trivial incidents. 3. It is interesting that at the same time as Saudi Arabia is showing such definite preference for the British the Shaikh of Bahrain is in a small way doing exactly the same. He informed me recently that on no account would he have an Ameri can as a State employee in charge of the Electric Light Depart ment, and he referred in conversation with me to his long ^ /friend&amp;hip2 friendship with the British and spoke with strange lack of cordiality, considering what the Bahrain Petroleum Company have done for him, of Americans as a whole and the employees of the Corporation in particular* towards Americans has become known to the Company management for yesterday evening (March 27th) Mr. Lloyd N. Hamilton the Chairman of the Bahrain Petroleum Company called to see me and referred to an incident which occurred quite recently at the causeway in which Lt* Merrill of the U.S* Air Force was involved and during which Lt. Merrill undoubtedly laid hands on a Bahrain Government employee* Mr. Hamilton stated that he had heard of this incident and had made enquiries with regard to Lt. Merrill’s outlook to the local inhabitants and his enqui ries had shown that the officer’s attitude in his opinion was far from satisfactory. This in Mr. Hamilton’s view was most, regrettable as it tended to bring Americans as a whole into disrepute and he personally was proud of the good relations which had existed between the Company and the Bahrain Government and people for so many years and did not want anything to occur to impair their relations. Mr. Hamilton then stated that he had already spoken to Mr. Henderson the American Minister from Baghdad about Lt. Merrill’s conduct and that he proposed to speak to General Connolly the Iraq—Persia Command during his forthcoming visit to Tehran and asked me if I had any objection to Lt. Merrill being transferred from Bahrain. I said that the incident was regrettable it was true but as far as I was concerned it was closed, that the officer in question had apologised and expressed his regrets and that there were no doubt faults on both sides. I went on to indicate that whatever Mr. Hamilton thought fit to do was his own business and that I should not view Lt. Merrill’s transfer with alarm and despondency as I preferred that incidents did not take 4* I suspect that this hardening of the Shaikh’s attitude place however provocative people might be P.R 28-3-44CONFIDENTIAL.

Governments.states that the signatory Governments agree 1 ( a ) # That the general purpose of this agreement is to iacilitate the orderly development of the international petroleum trade and that no provision in this .agreement, with the exception of Article II, is to be construed as applying to the operation of the domestic petroleum industry within the country of either Government. ( G ) -hat for the purposes of this Article the word 'country' shall mean: (l) i n relation to the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the United Tingdom, those British Colonies, overseas territories, 1 pr otectorates, protected states and/^nandated territories administered by that Government. lists of which as at the date of this Agreement have been exchanged.' rt will be seen that the definition of country / appliedapplied only to article VI1 of the Agreement. ihe liete which were exchanged did not include the Arab Sheikhdoms. The Petroleum agreement is a general declaration of intention and it would have made no practical iifference if they had been so included. 4. ;i6 regards the Chicago agreements, the position is more difficult. attention is invited to the note dated 27th Septemoer, 1945 recorded by Sir Geoffrey j rior on the subject (Copy attached •* .uinexl) ^ ■ &amp; &amp; 5. Cn the general question of the international atatus of the Arab Sheikhdoms the position was expounded at some length in Foreign Office letter lo. S 647/4/91 of 12rh February, 1935 (copy attached- Annex II) in connection with the status of Bahrein for the purposes of the Import Duties Act, 1932. ihe general conclusion seems to be that, in cases where H.V.G enter into inter national agreements covering territories under British protection, the Arab Cheikhdoras need not be regarded as automatically included, but that H.M.G. are at liberty to include them if they so wish oy specifically designating them. Before, however, so designating them the agreement of the Rulers is clearly desirable, since v/ithout it H.M.G. cannot normally implement the obligations which they may have undertaken internationally. Generally speaking, it is H.M.G’s policy so far as possible to lay emphasis vis-a-vis foreign countries, in the independent position of the sheikhdoms in order to forestall foreign criticism of our privileged position there, and to counter foreign (in particular Persian) claims to sovereignty over the territory of the sheikhdoms. 6* -*-n the particular case of the Chicago *A.r agreements, the conclusion seems to be that, internationally speaking, we are able to include the Bheikhdoros as territories covered by the U.K. signature, but the question of actually so designating chem will not arise until the necessity occurs of designating airports within the sheikhdoms. On \ v this interpretation i£ may be comparatively easy for the Political Resident to secure the agreement of the Bheikhs to the application of the Chicago Air Agreements to their territories without their feeling that due consideration has not been paid by H.V.G. to their position. India Office, S.W 1 14th f-ovemoer *45. Annex I l have been shown the India office file regarding the position of the Persian Gulf “'haikhdoras under the Chicago air agreement, and understand that 1 am invited to comment on this subject. 1 would have preferred to defer comment until I had access to my own records, but my personal views, for what they are v/orth, are as follows. 2.,. By the Final ^ct of the Conference it is apparently assumed under Recommendation 1 of Section VIII read with Article Viil Section 2 of Appendix 1, that His Majesty’s Government have acquired the right to dispose of the Sheikhdoms inteiests in civil Aviation. i submit that there is no foundation for this view. 3. i wirl take the States in detail. i-irst, as regards the crucial shaikhs- the view based on the exclusive treaties of the 6th i &amp; presumably arch 1392. Theae%l) however z , however, do not cede ue any authority to grant one to foreigners without reference to the rulers, ohaikhs would certainly not interfjret their agreements way. The rulers are, of course, well aware of ghts, and it will he recalled that we had the difficulty in securing our own original air rights elves.’ The Civil nir Agreement with .harjah and treaties conces si and the in this their ri grea test f or our s leoai - give us no support as they are purely ad hoc agreements for the benefit of B.O.a.C. Bahrain. 4. based on the and the 15th x^arch negative• Here again our x-^osition is presumably exclusive Treaties of the 2£nd December, 188 C, 1892. These treaties^&lt;a.re purely The shaikh binds himself not^lo enter into any agreement with foreign powers, but he does not give us carte blanc to act for him and in the past he has always been consulted in advance where his interests were aifected. in addition the Civil Air Agreement expressly provides that we will not allow foreign aircraft to use Bahrain aerodrome^ without the shaikh's consent, and this corar&gt;letely estops any claim on our part. 5 . K uwait. Here that of the exclusive treaty of 1899 is less emphatic than that of Bahrain and the Shaikh is not precluded from correspondence with foreign powers. His Civil Air Agreement is equally definite and precludes us from allowing foreign aircraft to use the 'aerodrome or aerodromes without the Shaikh’s consent. m other words the ^haikh expressly retains (and has been allowed by us to retain) the power to permit foreign aircraft to use his State. 6. In the case of Muscat r understand that it has been accepted that the Sultan is not bound by the Chicago agreement and the question of bringing him into the picture is being pursued separately. 7. /here we give advance intimation of our requirements to Gulf States, make it clear to them that their interests are being safeguarded, and take care not to offend their susceptibilities, then it is usually possible to obtain our requirements without difficulty. if this is not done the Tolitical officer’s task is rendered immeasurably more difficult and a molehill may easily turn into a mountain. in this case 1 myself had not seen a copy of the agreement until a week or so ago. xt must be remembered that our position in the xeraian Gulf has no other foundation than the goodwill of the states and can be easily undermined if this is once lost. 8. l think it is clear that our actions at Chicago cannot he held in any way binding on the ersian Gulf ohaikhdoms unless and until they have accepted the obligations involved. i have temporarily vacated rqy post it does not seem appropriate for me to suggest solutions for the difficulty and i would prefer to wait until ± have resumed charge and can consider the matter on the spot.

The position in international lev is however not conclusive for they purposes of the interpretation of an Act of Par liament of the United Kingdom anc the following represents the best that he can do in the way of straining the law to meet political exi b encies without absolutely misrepres enting it. 3. He .u 0 ^ests that ^ our reply to the Solicitor of the Customs should begin by referring to Beet ion 21 of the Imp rt -Iuties Act (1932) and x inting 6ut that this is a definition of the British Empire for the purposes of this Act and not for b enerrl purposes, and that the qu.tion at issue is merely whether Bahrain is or is not covered by any of the words of this definition Beet1 an. The only. . ards by whic] it could be covered, if it ' ere covered at all, are 'territories under His Majesty’s protection'.

On the other hand, in tns Chicago 'Two freedoms* Agreement (Inter national Air dervicea Transit Agreement) eacn signatory state has granted the otaer contracting states the privilege of flying across and landing for non-traffic purpos s in 'its territories'' and the definition *i 'territory* m Section 2 of Article VIII of the Interim Agreement as in cluding 'Territory under protection' is applicable to the Two freedoms agreement* 3* 4 note on the lisplications involved was recorded by Sir Geoffrey Irior and will be found below (Annex 1)* The fact remains that, tho U.&amp;* signature ut Chicago was given to agre^fienu which specifioally and in terns applied to all territories under the Sovereignty* suserainty, protection or maua&amp;te of the contracting Governments* The Jhaikhdoma are unquestionably under our protection for international purposes €u.id therefore the ’J*K* signature did cover them* So far as H*M.G* 's own relations with the Sh&amp;i&amp;htioftiB are coxioernsd, it nsv not have been correct for U.f.G* to sign agreements* covering the Shaihhdoma without consult mg them* Nevertheless i t is certein that, in ter nationally* the r J*K* is coxamitted in rospect of tae Ghaikbdoms, as territories under fi*k*G* f a proteoticn, iucid it is, therefore necessary tc find some way of getting the Ghaiichs to fulfil the obligations of the Chicago agreeit^nts ^iich the j.K* signed* The Political Resident stated in his telegr^ No*17?4 of 2nd December, 1945, triat he was proposing to take action to tins end*- 2 - \ 4* Article Vii of the Petroleum ;,^r ^ernent between the U.K# and U*S.

The lists which were exchanged did not include the Arab Shaikhdoms. The i'etro leuoi Agreement is a general declaration of intention and it would have made no practical difference if they had been so included* except that it would then have been posaible to hold that the oil trade between the Persian Gulf Shaikhdoma mid the U.K. or other British territory was domestic trade* and to that extent the activities of the International Petroleum Commission in regard to the international Petit)leum trade might have been impaired. 5. As regards the Bret ton Woods /^reements . the signatory governments* wider Article Section 2tg) of the Monetary Pund Agreement and Article XX Section 2(g) of the International Bank Agreement* undertook to accept the Agreements both on their own behalf and in respect of all colonies* eto.» Including all territories under their prelection . in point of fact the obligations were not such that they were likely to be of any practical effect so far as the Shaikhdoms were concerned, and H.M.G. * in the instrument of signature deposited with the U.3•Government* felt entitled to declare that they had taken 'all steps necessary to carry out all of its obligations under the said Agreement', in spite of the fact that the Shaikhs had not been consulted by them. 6. The ioQ) 11 eat ions involved are much the same as in the case of the Chicago Air Agreements. It has however been considered sufficient in this case simply to inform the Rulers that H.M.G. have accepted certain obligations under the Bretton Woods Agreements which will have effect in their territory. 7. The genaral conclusion seems to be that if we are going to maintain the position that the Arab Shaikhdoms of the Persian Gulf (excluding Muscat) are British protected states and can have no international relations with other states except through H.M.G. v then we must from time to time under take international obligations on their behalf* and must see* as a domestic matter between ourselves and the Shaikhdoms* that the latter fulfil those obligations so far as is required.(Received under India Office Printed Letter dated 7th May 1946).

I have been shown the India Office file regarding the position of the Persian Gulf Sheikhdoms under the Chicago air agre/iiient, and understand that I am invited to com ^nt on this subject* I would have preferred to defer ooBtfamt until I had access to my own records, but my personal views, tor what they are worth, ax*e as follows* y* By the Final Act of the Corfei’ence it is apparently assumed under Recommendation 1 oi Section VIII read with Article VIII Section 2 of Appenaix 1, that Hie 1 ajeaty's Government have acquired right to dispose of the Shaikh* doma interests in Civil Aviation* I submit that there is no fo undation fc r th is vi &amp;x • 3* I will take the Status in detail* First, as regards the Trudal Shaikhs - the view is presumably based on the exclusive treaties of the 6th liarcn 1892* These treaties, however do not cede us any authority to grant concessions to foreigners without reference to the rulers, and the Shaikhs would certainly not interpret their agreements in this way* The rulers are, of course, well aware of their ri^its, and it will be recalled that w e had the greatest difficulty in securing our own original air rights for our selves i The Civil Air Agreements with Sharjah and Bubal give us 'ho support as they are purely ad hoc arrangements for the benefit of B.O«A.C* Bahrain * Here again our pscition is presu mably based on the exclusive Treaties of the 22nd December, 1880, and the 13th ..arch, 1892* These treaties however are purely negative* The Shaikh binds himself not to entor into any agreement with foreign powers, but he does not give us carte blancne to act for him and in the past he has always been conseiited in advance where his interests were affected. In aduition the Civil Air Agre«jnent expressly provides that we will not allow foreign aircraft to use Bahrain aerodrome without the Shaikh’s consent, and this completely estops any claim on our part. Kuwait * Here the exclusive treaty of 1899 is less emphatic than that of Bahrain and the Shaikh is not precluded from correspondence with foreign powers* liis Civil Air Agreement is equally definite and precludes us from aliowir^ foreign aircraft to use th© aerodrome or aerodromes without the Shaikhs consent* In other words the Shaikh expressly retains (and has been allowed by us to retain) the power to permit foreign aircraft to use his State* 6* In the case of Muscat I understand th*t it has been accepted that the Sultan is not bound by the Chicago Agreement and the question of bringing him into the picture is being pursued separately* 7* V^here we give advance intimation of our requirements to Gulf States, make it clear to them that their interests are being safeguarded, and take c&amp;re not to offend their susceptibilities, then it is usually posoible to obtain our requirements without difficulty* If this is not done the Political Officer’s task is rendered immeasurably more difficult and a molehill may easily turn into a mountain* In this case I myself had not seen a copy of the agreement until a week or so ago* It must be remembered that our position in the Persian Gulf has no other foundation than the goodwill of the States and can easily be undermined if this is once lost* / 8 .- 2 - 8. X think it is clear that our actions at Chicago cannot he held in any way binding on the Persian Gulf Shaikhdoms unless and until they have accepted the obligations involved. As I have temporarily vacated my post it does not seem appropriate for me to suggest solutions for the difficulty and I would prefer to w a it until I have resumed charge and oan consider the matter on the spot. 1 request that copies of this note be sent by ^xpresc Air Bag to the Government of India and the Political Resident, Persian Gulf.

(ii) I do not believe that the Hindus who have left Sind will return there, or that those who depend on the pearl trade in Bombay will ever go to Karachi - particularly after the recent rioting there. (iii) If I myself ha^t to reply to Donaldson's letter I should express more than doubts about the wisdom of the suggestion to use the Qadiriya Order. It seems to me to be an undertaking of such delicacy that no one should contemplate it without first being certain of having the men properly equipped to carry it out and having an idea in detail of where it would lead. 2, Donaldson's letter, its enclosure, and your draft are returned herewith.

At the Conference of Middle East representatives which I attended in July, certain specific aims and tasks were laid down in connection with British Policy in the Middle East. Those for the Persian G-ulf were listed as follows: - 'financial guidance, particularly to Kuwait about the best use of oil revenues. Similar guidance to other States as their oil revenues increase. Local Administration should be continually reminded, as may be appropriate, of the need for social progress and equitable distribution of wealth. Emphasis to be laid on education. The slave trade must be stopped. A Levy force must be created for this purpose in the 'Crucial Coast. You should keep these points in mind as some of the primary objects of our present policy in the Gulf, and you may expect from time to time to be called on to report on the progress made in your Agency towards the achievement of these objects.

The discussions were opened by the Secretary of State on Thursday, 21st July. The ' inister of Defence and the Minister of State presi ded over other meetings. The Chiefs of Staff attended to assist in the discussion of security questions. Representatives of the Treasury and other interested departments took part in the examination of financial aspects of problems facing Middle East countries in regard to economic and social development and in particular to the vast complex of questions arising in connexion with' the relief and ultimate resettlement of Arab refugees. The position of the Middle East was reviewed in terms of the world situation and there was general recognition of the importance to Middle East countries of the development of con ditions which would contribute to the happiness and prosperity of their peoples. The purpose of these•discussions was limited. Mo major changes in policy were contemplated by the Secretary of State when, he summoned the Conference. The aim was to permit of a full and free exchange of information and views and this has been achieved. The whole position has been carefully surveyed in the light of the observations of His lajesty’s represen tatives and in due course the views expressed and the recom mendations advanced will be reported for the consideration of the Secretary of State. There was general agreement that it was desirable that exchanges of views of this kind ou-ht to take place from time to time.The Political Agent, Bahrain.
