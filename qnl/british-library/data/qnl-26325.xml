In that event it will be necessary to lay down in Clause 11 of the sketch contract that the Afghan Government should provide the instructor and his wife with free furnished quarters. g It would be difficult to enforce the provisions of the proposed contract by process of law, but we should hope that reliance should be placed on the diplomatic channel for the settlement of any disputes. 7 .

In accordance with the instructions given him on P.Z.3648/37, Colonel Praser-Tytler pressed the Afghan Government to employ a party of four British instructors in connection with the aircraft they are buying from Messrs. Hawkers. After a somewhat difficult piece of negotiation the Afghan Government agreed to employ this party at a total cost to them of £3,125&gt; to cover pay, allowances, pension contribution and liability in respect of sick leave after termination of employment. This enabled us to resume negotiations with the Afghan Minister for the sale of the aircraft, which now seeing to be on ^ point of conclusion. 2. The figure of £3,125 was based on information given to the Air Ministry orally sometime ago by Messrs. Hawkers, but a representative of the Company who came to discuss the matter with me on 2nd July expressed the view that suitable personnel could not now be obtained at the figures then quoted. The embarrassment which this volte face on the part of the Company caused us was explained to Messrs. Hawkers in the letter at P.Z.4309/37, whereupon the Company undertook to provide suitable personnel at the figures agreed with the Afghan Government. 3. We must now consider the details of the contracts providing for the employment of these instructors. The Afghans will no doubt prefer that these contracts should be between themselves and H.M.G. On the other hand, our experience with the aircraft contract shows this to be a cumbrous procedure, and it would be better from all points of view for the Afghan Government to negotiate direct with Messrs. Hawkers- The sketch of such a contract has been prepared, and is flagged, on the basis of suggestions e-i muifar? f-o -&gt;w ^(361 lb' BOGS Wt 9696/P 28 5000 4.37 IOP made/VC VUuWs ft KcvVjaV CiX U-^^jV? . made by Messrs.

Hawkers^ suggesting that the Company should negotiate on its basis contemplate. 4. There is one difficult point. In the event of any of the British instructors being guilty of a criminal offence in Afghanistan, they would become subject to the barbarous provisions of the Shariat. We cannot ask the Afghan Government to guarantee them against this in the contract; indeed, the Afghan Government generally insist in such contracts that their employees should specifically The best way out would be for Major Macann to seek an oral and personal assurance on the subject from the Afghan Prime Minister. 5. There are submitted (a) a draft letter to Squadron Leader Williams, (b) a draft Note to the Afghan Minister, and (c) a draft Despatch for issue by air mail to Major Macann. In Amanullah’s time there were some cases of trials of Europeans for crimes of violence under the Shariat, the influence of the mullahs having prevented any great reform of the Afghan criminal law. The question of the legal position of foreigners in Afghanistan resulting from these cases is discussed in Chapter XXXV of the Afghan Precis (1928), which states in conclusion 'There are now precedents for public trial and for the reduction of the i principle of cisas (handing over of the accused to the Some alterations proposed by the Air Ministry and the O r-vct with Ali Mphampd.

On the other hand, in the absence of diplomatic representation Europeans . • • are liable to be detained indefinitely in prison, and in all cases . . . the political considerations of the moment are likely to be paramount. ' Since the date when this was written^the attitude of the Afghan Govt, and public opinion has no doubt made further progress in modernisation. Col. Fraser-Tytler reported in a telegram of 8th April, 1936 (P.Z. 2416/36) that 'no cases have occurred recently of European nationals being subjected to the more barbarous provisions of the Shariat'. In the event of a case involving a European British subject we should no doubt, in view of our friendly relations with the Afghan Govt., be able to rely on diplomatic representations to prevent any substantial injustice. The position should, I think, be explained to Messrs. Hawkers as in the draft letter, but we do not want to frighten them unduly. We will arrange, if necessary, for one of their representatives to call here m order to explain the matter further. 40 Draft Paper.

The reasons appear to be that he wants to&lt;get married and .to get a Commission in the Indian Army and that such thoughts have unsettled him thoroughly.

He has been doing very uspful. work in Afghanistan and we are anxious to see our connection with the Afghan Air Force maintained by men of his type and technical ability - all the more so since the Italian aircraft personnel have left Afghanistan and we now hold the field in aircraft matters. you may be able to make.

Robinson and the Afg'an Government, It is quite correct that payment of part of Mr, Robinson's salary has been made to us by the Afgan Government and this money has been received through Hawker Aircraft Ltd, We would state, however, that payment from August 1940 to February 18th, 1941 (the date the old contract expired) has not yet come to hand. The money received by us less certain payments to relatives in accordance with Mr. Robinson's instructions, stands to the credit of his account. We think you will agree that your letter does not constitute instructions from Mr. Robinson to remit the balance of his account as, of course, this would mean that the payment to relatives would automatically cease. We think the better course will be for Mr. Robinson to send us instructions direct so that we may be fully covered in the matter.

As we.understand it Mr, Robinson has beeri receiving only £749 (? £750) in all, and this amount include^£375 which is actually paid to him direct by the Afghan Government in Afghan currency although the responsibility for the payment of his whole salary of £750 remains with Messrs.

Under the terms of the first contract, Robinson was paid £530.0.0. per annum by the Afghan Government, half of which was paid direct to us, and the remainder paid to Robinson in Afghan currency. It was agreed that we should be responsible for Robinson’s wages and expenses while in Afghanistan, and any payments he received from the Afghan Government we debited against wages and expenses due to him.

The first contract was for one year only, and this terminated in February, 1939 • When Robinson signed a second contract, his salary was automatically increased to £750.0.0. per annum, in accordance with Clause 21 of the first contract. * In view of this extra £200.0.0. per ^ year, Robinson's wages were raised by us on the 25 . 2 . 5 § to £7.0.0. per week with expenses as before. r * V 1 ' k ^ l ^1(0 After the expiration of the second contract, we desired Robinson to return. However, we were pressed for him to remain in Afghanistan, and a third contract was signdd on similar terms to the second, and this expires in February, 19^1. On the 26th October last, we wrote our representative, Robinson, telling him that the third contract, as far as we were concerned, would be the last, and that he should, therefore, make preliminary arrangements to return to England. Since this, we have received a wire from Robinson to the effect that he was carrying out the arrangements as suggested by us. As we understand that the Afghan Government are anxious to renew Robinson's contract for a further year, we beg to suggest that if this is so desired, tkis contract should oe made between Robinson himself and the Afghan Governmen_t, and that all wages and expenses should be borne by them, unless the British Government are in agreement whereby they pay, and Robinson's services are retained. We have no objection whatever to our representative remaining in Afghanistan, providing that suitable arrangements made to cover his services s as above mentioned. As Robinson's contract, since the cont 1 d pt.. o.onset, has been extended for such a long period, we feel that now, either the Afghan or British Government should be held responsible for tne total cosc.

As far as we understand the position, his Contract was dated the 10th of February, 19^8, and it was for one year, with the right of the Afghanistan Government to exercise an option for a further year. This was exercised, and the Con tract in due course expired on the loth of February 1940.

R. Robinson, the Rolls-Royce mechanic attached to the Afghan Air Force, has received a telegram from your firm recalling hin to England. The Minister says that Robinson w ull prefer to continue serving in Afghanistan and, apart from the absolute necessity of having a Rolls-Royce mechanic at Kabul which means the he could not leave until a relief arrived, he is in any case bound to give the Afghan Government 3 months notice of the termination of his services. Sir Kerr Fra^ter-Tytler reco sends that, in view of the good work which Robinson is doing at Kabul, he should be allowed to remain there. We have discussed Sir Kerr Fraser-Tytler* s telegram with Ar. Russell-Stracey of Hawker Aircraft, and understand from him that the whole difficulty has arisen owing to the failure of the Afghan Government to renew Robinson's contract, apparently on account of 0 small increase of salary for which he is asking, and that Rolls-Royce would be quite content to leave Robinson where he is if the question of his contract were satisfactorily settled. e agree with Sir Kerr Fraser-Tytler that it vjuld be unfortunate if Robinson were to be recalled at this juncture, and we should be most grateful if you could confirm that the attitude of your Company in this matter is as stated above. 1 Yours sincerely, / G • h .

I understand that he works quite well at his job, which is that of a , rigger*, and that he does not much mind whether he stays or returns to Hawkers, but I should like to meet the Afghan Government's wishes If possible* ' , Lfc' ^ £ &lt;r 3* It has been suggested that possibly the hoyal Air Force in India can provide a man to take Lewis* place* If this were possible it woulil help Hurt-Andrews a lot, since naturally he does not find it always easy towork with civilians, good though they are at their jobs* 4* There is also the question of the wireless operator and photographic expert, see correspondence ending with jay !, V Haj or ¥«B« Hay, C•I•£•• Deputy secretary to the Government of India in the external Affairs Department, New Delhi*express letter No« 465 1 dated the 20th r a/f 1L ; JJ&amp;rJt,„* J «*%** Andrews would like these men to come up now and to stay a year| since he does not think they would he able to make much progresi in less than this time* I feel this is rather a lot to ask from the Royal Air Force at tie present time, but as it is our policy to secure our position in the Afghan Air Force, they might consider what they can do to meet this request* 5, The question of pay is also for consideration* If the man or men sent up were from the Royal Air Force I think they should come outwardly as civilians but actually seconded from the Royal Air Force* If that were done they would presumably require less pay than the Kawker civilians, and a portion of the £550 now paid by the Afghan Government to Lewis could go to the wireless and photograph men* 6, But before going further into details of this sort I should be glad to know how the Royal Air Force view these proposals in general* 7 # I am sending a copy of this letter to Peel by air mail* Yours sincerely, Sd/- W.K.

Dear Crombie, 18th May, 1938, With reference to our telephone conversation yesterday regardin£ a replacement of our mechanic, Powell, in Kabul, who fs^being invalided home, we have been looking round for a suitable man and think that we have found someone who would undertake the job. On the other hand we have had no official request from the -fghan Government for a replacement and therefore the cuestion arises as to whether a man will be required to complete the contract which Powell was serving under, or whether he will be required to serve under a new contract for a period of a year starting from the date that the new contract is signed. ft I would be very grateful if you could obtain the necessary information as naturally the conditions of service as regards pay etc. rather depend on the length of time that the new man may have to serve in Kabul.

Minute Paper. political Department. Mr.WnlVon . Northern Deportment, Foreign Office , Hr.Sutton of Hawkera rancr me up yesterday to say thflt the Afghan Winister had informed the Company that he had now received instructions from his Government that the period of the contracts for Mr.Russell Stracey **nd the other British instructors in Afghanistan should run from the date of the handing over of the aeroplanes to the Afghan Government after the test flights had been carried out. This was what was provided in p^ra.6 of the original draft contracts which were altered at the request of the Afghan Government themselves so as to m^ke the contracts run from the date of signature. This latter arrangement resulted in a certain financial saving for the Company since it meant th^'t they would be relieved of the payment of the salaries of the air personnel in Afghanistan at an earlier date, although on the other hand it did not really increase the ultimate liability of the Afghan Government who would in any case be paying the salaries during a period of one year. It was owing to this th»t the Company were prepared to agree somewhat reluctantly to the other financial amendments suggested by the Afghan Government. For example the Company --greed that the salaries of the instructors should only be payable by the Afghan Government up to the date of the termination of the contracts in Afghanistan instead of up to the date of the return of the instructors to this country as originally provided in the draft, and they also agreed to waive the payment of expenses during the journey home. The Company have in fact accepted all the amendments put forward by the Afghans, both those contained in Katodon 144 of 'hid December and the considerable number of additional amendments which the Afghan ' inister 5853 5000 3/37 produced/produced during hia interview with Mr.Collier on 6th December, except thst they were unable to agree to n reduction in the insurance premiums provided for in clause 11. Hawkers are extremely surprised and indignant at this sudden volte face on the p*rt of the Afghans, just when the contracts appear^to be on the point of signature after more than three months* delay, which h's been entirely due to the dil^toriness of the Afghan Government, *nd the rather obstructive attitude adopted by Ali Mohammad, and they do not see their way to accepting thia further alteration. The Afghans are being most unreasonable in this matter and I think that we ought to telegraph r*t once to Kabul, instructing Colonel Eraser Tytler to lodge a protest and try and persuade the Afghan Government to agree to a*] immediate signature of the contracts without further alteration. A draft is suggested accordingly. Ihis case should be a warning to us against employing the Afghan Minister in London as a medium of negotiations where this can possibly be avoided, since it is clear that his attitude has been 1 rgely responsible for the delays and difficulties which have arisen.Thank you for your letter of the 30th ultimo, reference P.Z.8323/37., and for the information given therein. Confirming my telephone conversation of yesterday, we now agree the contracts to the final revision of the Afghan Minister in London, that is to say, we delete reference to right of appeal to the War Minister and forego the claim to half pay during the return journey should this take place after the expiration of the contract. Agreements are being prepared and we shall get into touch with the Legation for the signature of the Minister in London at the earliest possible date.

INDIA OPFI I am now able to reply to your letter of the 9th instant, reference P.Z.7978/37, and enclose herewith a draft of a revised contract for Mr. Russell-Stracey, which really does represent the limit to which we can go without consulting him and the other men. I have not altered the contracts for the other people yet as even the attached draft may prove unacceptable to the Afghan Minister. My comments are as follows Clause 3. Reference to right of appeal to the^ Minister for National Defence has been left in, and we will accept the guidance of Colonel Fraser-Tytler as to whether this remains or not. i* Clause 6 . In view of the large number of concessions we are making, we feel entitled to date the contract as indicated. Clause 7, agrees to the reduced leave period and incorporates the requirements regarding permission to travel. Clause 8 . There is a slight difference to the wording, and we have introduced reference to twelve equal payments. Clause 9. We think that this suggests a fair bargain in view of the deletion of expense^., Afi^er all, it is not an unusual condition. i of expenses. After all, it is n Clause 11. The insurance rates are those normally ruling for this class of cover. quarters. Clause 12. We have included reference to unfurnished Clause 17, retains for Mr. Russell-Stracey the right to seek his own medical adviser without losing the option of free service.G.E. Crombie, Esq., Contd. 20/1P/37. Clause 19, is brought into line with the other alterations. If you will again be so good as to examine the draft and let us know your opinion, we will then make contact with the Afghan Minister and endeavour to reach finality. Yours sincerely, ENC:IBf rSo V J CONTRACT BETWEEN THE ROYAL AFGHAN GOVERNMENT AND HAWKER AIRCRAFT LIMITED, CANBURY PARE ROAD, KINGSTON-ON-THaI.ES, ENGLAND, concerning the services of MR. EDWARD GEORGE HONEYWOOD RUSSELL-STRACEY, placed at their disposal by the said company. Mr. Russell-Stracey will be employed by the Afghan Government in the capacity of a Pilot Instructor. He will assist in the training and organisation of the Afghan Air Force and will be in direct charge of the British mechanics employed by the Afghan Government.

During the period of this contract annual leave of thirty-one days on full pay will be granted to Mr. Russell-Stracey. Mr. Russ ell-Stracejr may accumulate this and other leave to v/hich he would be entitled in the case of a renewal of the contract (see clause 19) so as to enable him to take it in one unbroken period which he will be at liberty to take either in or outside Afghanistan, it being understood that permission to travel in Afghanistan must first be obtained from the Afghan Government. Mr. Russell-Stracey will be paid a salary of £1,250 (one thousand, two hundred and fifty pounds) (sterling) per annum by twelve equal instalments payable monthly in arrear of which half will be paid in sterling to Hawker Aircraft Limited,and the remainder will be paid in Afghan currency, at the Peshawar rate of exchange, to Mr. Russell-Stracey in Afghanistan. Payments due will be calculated from the date of signature (see clause 6). The payments will be made free from all deductions, taxes etc. and no restrictions will be placed on the withdrawal from Afghanistan of any unexpended balance.

In the case of any renewal the conditions of the first period contract shall remain, except as above, unless altered by the joint consent of Mr. Russell-Stracey and Hawker Aircraft Limited.INDIix OFFICE, WHITEHALL, LONDON, 3.7. 9th December, 1937 Thank you for your letter of 7th December (BW3/GHP) about the contracts for the aviation instructors for Afghanistan. The Afghan Minister duly called at the Foreign Office on the 6th December to discuss this matter and I am sorry to say that he asked for several further amendments in addition to those mentioned in my letter of O^d December bo Lucas. These are as follows;- Paragraph 3 of Ur. Hussell-Stracey's contract. - The second sentence should be omitted. The Minister explained that the chief instructor would naturally have free communication with the Minister of Defence, and that in any case, in the event of difficulty, the matter would normally be taken up by the British Minister at Kabul. He felt, therefore, that this sentence was superfluous. Paragraph 7 of Mr. Russell-Stracey’s contract. - The Afghan Government felt that leave of 42 days was excessive, since Afghan employees of the Government had only 20 days. He therefore suggested that the period R. o', button Esq. , should/ Hawker Aircraft Ltd., King s t on-on-Thame s.should be one month. (He did not say that the leave of the other instructors should be reduced in proportion). Secondly, the last words of the article, '... which he will be at liberty to tahe either in or outside Afghanistan.' should either be omitted or amended to include reference to the necessity for getting the permission of the Afghan Government before travelling in Afghanistan. The Minister said that the words were really unnecessary, since the Afghan Government would naturally expect the instructors to take their leave outside Afghanistan if they wanted to, and he understood that it was the desire to ensure freedom to leave Afghanistan which had prompted the insertion of these words. Paragraph 8. - The salaries should be payable up to the date of the termination of the contract, and not up to the date of arrival in the United Kingdom. Paragraph 9* - The Afghan Government could not pay expenses for the return journey above the actual fare. V/lien it was pointed out to the Minister that this alteration, in combination with the amendment to paragraph 6, would mean that the instructors would actually be out of pocket in tne course of their return journey, he said that if the amendments could be accepted, it/— it might he possible expenses for travell Government, i.e. if to arrange for the inclusion of ing in the fare paid by the Afghan the fare was, say, £80, hr. Russell- Stracey could be given a lump sum of £105 for his return journey. Paragraph 11 of hr. Russell-Stracey’s contract. - The Afghan Government found the insurance premium of ^H* 0* 0• too high. (l see that there is a very large difference between the premiums to be paid for the insurance of Mr. Russell-Stracey and that of the other instructors. T presume that this is because his insurance must cover flying risks; but you 'will no doubt consider whether it is possible to obtain satisfactory insurance for a smaller premium. The Afghan Minister said that the German civil pilot employed oy the Afgnan Government is insured for less than this.) Paragraph 13. - The Minister said that the distance between the instructors’ living quarters and the aerodrome would be not more than one mile. Paragraph 20. — ine Afghan Government would like to delete this altogether. The Minister assured the Foreign/Foreign Office that there would he no difficulty in the way of the departure of one of the instructors if his contract was terminated undar the provisions of the clauses mentioned? and he felt that the insertion of such an article in the contract was derogatory to the status of the Afghan Governin' nt and might give a wrong impression of conditions in Afghanistan. Paragraph 21. - The Afghan Government could not pay the fare for the return journey to England on leave he tween two periods of service. The Minister suggested that if the instructor had com-leted, say, three years’ service, and was going to renew his contract, he could negotiate for the inclusion in the new contract of a provision for the payment of his return fare to England. As regards furniture, the Minister was asked whether the instructors would he ahle to sell their furniture secondhand in Afghanistan at the conclusion of their service without paying customs duty. He promised to find this out. I understand that the main reason for all these amendments, particularly those affecting finance, is the fear of the Afghan authorities of creating a precedent/I (^.0\ precedent and laying themselves open to claims for similar treatment from their many other foreign employees who? they say y do not receive treatment* on the lines of your' original draft contracts. I -ay add in confidence that the foreign Office gained the impression that if the Company are prepared to omit the clauses which the Afghans find undesirable, and accept their assurances of generous treatment outside Lne contracts, they will probably be aole to reach a more satisfactory understanding than might appear from tne letter of the contracts. The Minister was told in conclusion that one amendments he had xjroposed would be suomitted to the Company who would be advised to get into touch wioh him when they had considered them. He said that if the Company accepted these amendments, he 'would be prepared- to sign the contracts with them, and suggested that they could then be sent to the instructors for counter-signature. The only one of these amendments on which we should like to comment specially is the proposed omission of the second sentence of Mr. RusseJJ-Stracey ’ s contract. 1/I understand that this sentence was inserted at the suggestion of Colonel Praser-Tytier v/ith the object of ensuring that Mr. Russet--St race y would, whenever necessary, be able to refer any matters of difficulty to the highest quarters without hindrance or obstruction thus avoiding the friction which might be caused by the necessity for frequent interventions by the Legation. ,/e thinh it would be sufficient if Colonel Fraser-Tytier could obtain an oral assurance from the Afghan Government to the same effect, and if you agree we will telegraph to him and instruct him to try and do this. We do not suggest that the Company need delay discussing the other amendments with the nfghan Minister on this account hut, since the point may be of some importance, we do advise that they should not finally commit themselves about it until we have received Colonel Fraser-Tytler T s reply. The Minister could he told meanwhile that the point must be further considered. as regards the other amendments it is of course possible that the Afghan Minister may have added a few of these off his own bat and if the Company feel strongly aboiro the.i it would no doubt be possible to cut him out by//■7&gt; V by arranging (on the plea that the instructors themselves would have to see them before you could agree) that the negotiations should be transferred to Kabul. On the other hancx this would be bound to lead to still further delay which we all wish to avoid. tfe shall be glad if you can let us know what you eventually decide on these points.leave of 49 days was excessive, since Afghan e!Woye*&gt;e of th* Government had only 90 day*. TT e tK^fore suggested that the period should ho one month.

Kuasell-Btracey could be given a lump sum of £105 for his return journey. Paragraph 11 of Mr. Russell-St racey ’ s contract. - The Afghan Government found the insurance premium of £11.5.0. too high. (I see that there is a very large difference between the premiums to be paid for the insurance of Mr. Rueaell-Ctr*cey and that of the/the other inetructors I presume th^t this is bec^ je his insursnce must cover flying risks; but you will no doubt consider whether it is possible to obtain satisfactory insurance for a smeller premium* The Afghan Minister said that the German civil pilot employed by the Afghan Government is insured for less than this.)

As regards furniture, the Minister was asked whether the instructors would be able to sell their furniture secondhand in Afghanistan at the conclusion of their service without paying customs duty.

We do not mind how much you modify the form of the draft. Ali Muhammad made the same point about medical attendance in article 18 as the Afghan Minister for Foreign Affairs made to Fraser-Tytler (Kabul telegram 144) so that I have not included this in the draft. He did In order to save time I have recorded what he not/ G-.3. Crombie, Ssq.not mention Faiz Muhammad’s proposed amendment to article 6. I think it is possible that there is some confusion between this question and that of the termination of the contract referred to by Ali Muhammad. But I imagine that Hawkers had better assume that both amendments are required. These further changes are a nuisance, and may increase the expenses of Hawkers and/or the instructors, but I definitely had the impression that the Afghans were chiefly concerned to avoid putting in writing terms more generous than those which they grant to their other foreign employees, or such as might seem to be derogatory to the status of Afghanistan as a civilized country.

He felt, therefore, that this sentence ^ara^rraph 7 of Mr. Bussell-Ptracey' s contract. - The Afghan Government felt that leave/the/ leeve of 4^ days was excessive, since Afghan employers of thf» f^overment h©d only SO d&amp;y». w e therefore suggested that the period should he one month. fife did not say that the leave of the other instructors should he reduced in proportion). secondly, the last words of the article, '... which he will he at liberty to take either in or outside Afghanistan;’* should either he omitted or amended to include reference to the necessity for sretUncr the permission of the Afghan Government before travelling In /‘fghanleten. ''he minister said thet the words were really unnecessary, since the Afghan Government would naturally exoeot the instructors to take their leave outside Afghanistan if they wanted to, and he understood that it was the desire to ensure freedom to leave Afghanistan which had promoted the insertion of these words. Paragraph B. - The salaries should be osyable uo to the date of the termination ofthe/ the contract, not up to the date of arrival in the United Kingdom. Paragraph f 5. - The Afghan Government could not pay expen^en for the return journey above the actual fare. '?hen it was pointed out to the Minister that this alteration, in combination with the amendment to paragraph 6, would mean that the instructors would actually be out of pocket in the course of their return journey, he said that if the amendments could be accepted, it might be possible to arrange for the inclusion of expenses for travelling in the fare p ! ^id by the Afghan Government, i.e. if the fare was, sny, £80, Mr. Russel 1-Strscey could be given a lump sum of £106 for his return journey. Paragraph 11 of Ur. Russell-Stracey’s contract. - The Afghan Government found the insurance premium of £11.5.0. too high. (I see that there is a very large difference between the premiums to be paid for the insurance of l?r. Ruesell-Strt cey and that of■■ —fc ^ the other instructors. I presume that this is because his insurance must cover flying risks; but you will no doubt consider whether it is possible to obtain satisfactory insurance for a smaller premium. The Afghan Minister said that the German civil pilot employed by the Afghan Government is insured for less than this.) Paragraph 12. - The Minister said that the distance between the instructors* living quarters and the aerodrome would be not more than one mile. Paragraph 20. - The Afghan Government would like to delete this altogether. The Minister assured the Foreign Office that there would be no difficulty in the w&lt;-y of the departure of one of the instructors if hie contract was terminpted under the provisions of the clauses mentioned, and he felt that the insertion of such an article in the contract was derogatory to the status of the Afghan K Government ^nd might give a wrong impression of/ k k 'of conditions in Afghanistan. Paragraph 21. - The Afghan Government could not pay the fare for the return journey to England on leave between two periods of service. The Minister suggested that if the instructor had completed» say, three years’ service, and was going to renew his contract, he could negotiate for the inclusion in the new contract of a provision for the payment of his return fare to 1 ngland. As regards furniture, the Minister was asked whether the instructors would be able to sell their furniture secondhand in Afghanistan at the conclusion of their service without paying customs duty. lie promised to find this out. I understand that the main reason for all these amendments, particularly those affecting finance, is the fear of the Afghan authorities of creating a precedent and laying themselves open to claims for similar treatment from their many other foreign employees who, they say, do not/not receive treatment on the lines of your original dr^ft contracts. I may add in confidence that ve have the impression that if you are prepared to omit the clauses which the Afghans find undesirable, and accept thei assurances of generous treatment outside the contract*, you will probably be able to reach a more satisfactory understanding than might appear from the letter of the contracts. The Minister was told in conclusion that the amendments he had proposed would be submitted to you, and that you would be advised to get into touch with him when you had considered them. He said that if you accepted these amendments, he would be prepared to sign the contracts with you, and suggested that they could then be sent to the instructors for counter-signature. We shall be glad if you can let us know what you eventually decide on these points.IN &gt;IA OFFICE, WHITEHALL, S.W.l 3rd December, 1937. Dear Lucas, T 'e have just received a telegram from our Minister at Kabul in reply to the telegram which was sent off after my telephone conversation with you a few days ago on the subject of the contracts for the Air Instructors who are now on their way to Afghanistan. Colonel Fraser Tytler reports that the Afghan Government now want to make certain amendments in the contracts as follows^— (1) Article 6 . The period of the contract to be for one year from the date of signature Instead of one year(5) An article to be added to the effect that tonring to- on holidays in Afghanistan, e«g,]3swain, onl; r to be permitted with the prior sanction of the Afghan Government* As regards (1) the reason for this amendment is not stated, but Colonel Fraser Tytler suspects that it may be in order to bring the Instructors under the direct control of the Afghan Gov e rnnent as soon as possible* It does not appear to be very important from the point of view of the Company who nay possibly be relieved of some slight financial liability for salaries on account of it* The amendment in Article IS, which seems to be the most important, is unfortunate, but the Afghan Government state that furnished quarters have never been provided for foreign employees. No doubt the furniture which the Afghan Government could provide would be scanty and of poor quality and Colonel Fraser Tytler has secured permission for the Instructors to import furniture from India free of customs duty. This is a considerable concession since I understand that in the ordinary ?ray the import of furniture into Afghanistan is wholly prohibited The/The Minister states that the free transport facilities originally provided for in Article 13 have never been granted in the past. He adds that distances are not great and that bicycles are cheap so that the deletion of the article would not seem to be of much importance. Colonel Fraser Tytlor feels that the Af^ian amendment in Article 18 is reasonable, though in practice the Instructors would probably prefer to utilise the services of the Legation Surgeon whose charges are not high. Finally with regard to the new article which the Afghan Government propose he thinks this is quite harmless and may be accepted. The Afghan Minister is calling £t the Foreign Office on Monday afternoon to discuss these amendments and for their guidance in speakin to him that would be extremely grateful if you could possibly let us have before then some indication of the Company’s viev/s. As far as we can see the amendments suggested are of minor importance with the exception perhaps of the amendment in Article 12 which is c rtainly rather If the Company are perpared to accept the amendments/ tiresome.@) 4* anendnente I suppose that the contracts could now be signed in London by the Afghan Minister and by the Cortj any and sent out to Kabul for counter-signature by the Instructors themselves. I am sorry to trouble you with this at such short notice. I tried to get you or Mr. Sutton on the telephone this afternoon but was unsuccessful.

(By Air Mail.) I have the honour to inform you that at an interview with the Prime Minister this morning I mentioned the matter of the non-applicability to British instructors of certain provisions of Shariat law, as instructed in paragraph 2 of your despatch No. 104, dated the 4th August, 1937. He immediately gave m!e his personal assurance that in no event would a procedure or penalty not in accord with western ideas lie enforced against them. His Royal Hig'hness then expressed his admiration for the British character in general and said he was sure no such contingency would ever arise, but if it did, His Majesty’s Government had his word. He added with a smile and by way of illustration^ that he had received such courtesy and consideration from the plain-clothes police officers detailed to look after him during his recent visit to London, that he was always anxious lest he, himself, should unwittingly commit a social solecism in their presence. 2 .

LmI * t 19th August, 1937. \ Very many thanks for your letter dated 17th August, regarding wives in Afghanistan. I quite understand the British Minister’s point of view and agree that it is a matter that must be left to the instructors themselves to decide. I will refer them to your letter so that if they do want to t^ke their wives they do so with their eyes open. The most important point though, is of course, the fact that there is no restriction on them taking their wives if they definately wish to do so. Yours sincerely,I rid: 17th August,1937. P.Z 5312/ 37 Will you please refer to my letter No.P.Z.5115/37 of I have now had a reply on this point from Colonel Fraser- instructors would prefer to go to Kabul alone although he recognises that they would probably be happier v/ith their wives, who could do a good deal to make life more confortable for them. He thought it likely that, if the instructors’ contracts are to be for no longer than a'year, they might have thought it not worth v/hile to take their wives for that period. Also the cost of living at Kabul is inclined to be high if the instructors wish to rely on stores imported from Europe, instead of on 7/hat the centry provides, as they would have to pay Afghan customs’ duty on such stores. Moreover Kabul rather lacks amenities, and life there for women without a job to 10th August, para.5, regarding the air instructor’s wives ? Tytler. He tells me that he had hitherto assumed that the P.G.Lucas,Esq., Hawker Aircraft Ltd., Brooklands Aerodrome | ENCLOSURE IN WEEKLY 7 mcfT upy/ Weybridge,Surrey . No. 33 19 AUG 1937 | FROM SECRETARY, P0UT.4AL MO COPY SENT TOoccupy them is likely to be dull at times and not very comfortable. The British Legation will do what they can to help them, but the Afghan Government is unlikely to grant any facilities that they do not grant to other foreign employees, who are mostly Germans and whose standard of living is lower than that which the British instructors would probably wish to maintain. On the other hand, conditions in Kabul are improving and a year there -would be an interesting experience for anyone. Moreover, India is only a day's journey away. In short, we think the matter is one for the instructors themselves to decide, and we would not advise them in either direction. Yauv's sinoar'Gfv^ (Sd.) H. A. F.

Sir, I have considered Colonel Fraser-Tytler 1 s ^ Despatch ho.71 of the 9th July regarding the employment hy the Afghan Government of British instructors in aviation and I now transmit to you herewith a copy of a sketch contract which is 'being forwarded to Hawker Aircraft Limited for their consideration, and of a note which I am sending to the Afghan Minister on this subject. 2* It seems desirable, subject to your views, to make it clear to the Afghan Government that in the event of a British instructor breaking any of the laws of Afghanistan, His Majesty’s Government would not tolerate his subjection to those provisions of the Shariat which are not in accordance with v/estern ideas. It is clearly difficult to obtain a safeguard against this in the proposed contracts but I shall be glad if, provided you see no objection, you will mention the matter to the Afghan Prime Minister and seek from him an oral and personal assurance that on the unlikely hypothesis predicated he will personally see that no procedure or penalty not in accord with western ideas is enforced.

He will be employed mainly at the Headquarters of the Afghan Air Force at Kabul, and will advise the Afghan Government in any matters connected with their air services in which they may seek his advice. (N.B. The mechanics* contracts would provide that they will be employed as mechanics to assist in the training of the Afghan Air Force and in the maintenance of the aircraft of the Force and that they will be employed mainly at Kabul. It seems difficult to restrict employment entirely to Headquarters at Kabul)« 2. Mr. will not interfere with the political or religious affairs of Afghanistan and will not take part in any commercial activity. 3.

In the case of personnel who hand over the aircraft at Kabul, their contracts would date from the day of handing over. His Majesty’s Minister, Kabul, has suggested tentatively a period of one year, and if the Afghans prefer one year, the contracts might be made for that period). 7. After one year’s completed service Mr. will be entitled to 20 days’ leave on full pay and to one month’s leave with pay for each year of completed service, exclusive of the first year. (K.B.

The Afghan Government will provide Mr. with xree furnished Quarters, of a character apj^ropriate to his status.(H.M. Minister, Kabul, reports that this is a necessary provision. The alternative of a house-rent allowance is undesirable because houses are difficult to obtain and rents are liable to be exorbitant.) 12. This contract may be terminated either by ^ r '* or by the Afghan Government on three months* notice. The Afghan Government may give 3 months’ pay in lieu of notice. 13. If r. terminates this contract before the expiration of one year from its commencement, he will not receive an allowance for his return journey and if he terminates the contract before the expiration of six months from its commencement he will return half the allowance paid to him in respect of his Journey from London to Kabul. 14.

I had our Secretariat in the Department of the Air Member for Personnel go through the revised draft of contracts and thej^ have made some pencil notes mainly with a view to anticipating possible points of dispute, and I think they are self-explanatory. I agree with your suggestions that when we have made up our minds Messrs. Hawkers should negotiate on its general basis with the Afghan Minister, and for the Foreign Office to tell Muhammad Ali that we expect him to negotiate direct with Hawkers about this matter. I also agree that Macamm could tell the Afghan Government what procedure we are following and to explain that if there are Royal Air Force personnel among the instructors - and they would in any event only be on the reserve - they would not wear uniform while in Afghanistan.

We agree generally v/ith the procedure proposed in your letter to Darvall, except that, in view of Article 2 of the specimen contract enclosed in Fraser- Tytier’s despatch No.71, we would suggest adding a warning to Hawkers that they should beware of any attempt by the Afghans to insert a provision subjecting the instructors to Afghan law. It may be that the assurance on this subject to be obtained from the Afghan Prime Minister should be rather more definite than you propose in paragraph 3 of your letter to Darvall, but we shall be able to discuss this in more detail when the necessary instructions are being sent to Macann. We/ H. A. F.

Despatch fkom His Majesty’s Minister, Kabul, to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, London, No. 71, dated the 9th (received 14th) July 1937. (Copy sent by Air Mail.) With reference to the last sentence of your telegram of the 28th June 1937 (Forminka-(i4) 1 have the honour to forward as an annexure to this despatch a memorandum containing suggestions regarding the contents of the contracts to be concluded for the employment of British instructors for the Afghan Air Force. 2.

While 1 do not suggest that this form of agreement should necessarily be followed in the present case, it may be of use to His Majesty’s Government as illustrating the type of contract usually concluded between the Afghan Government and its foreign employees. 3. 1 have not considered it necessary to suggest the insertion of a clause providing for free access to His Majesty’s Legation. The Afghan Government do not appear to object to such access to their Legations or Embassies by other foreign employees, and the representatives of the Marconi Company experience no difficulty about coming to His Majesty’s Legation when they wish to. 4. It should also be arranged, though this need not perhaps appear in the contract, that personnel of the fioyal Air Force should not wear uniform while in Afghanistan. 5. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Secretary of State for India and the Government of India. lA tAnnexure I to lyabul despatch No. 71, dated 9th July, 1937.) _ MEMORANDUM. The following suggestions are offered regarding the form of contract to be drawn up for the employment of British Instructors for the Afghan Air Force. It is presumed that the instructors will not be accompanied by either wives or families :— (a) Terms of employment. — (i) Instructors will work under the direct orders of either the Chief of the General Staff or Commandant of the Air Force and will have a right of appeal to His Royal Highness the Minister for National Defence. They will not be placed under the orders of any foreign employee of the Afghan Government. (it ) They will be employed solely to carry out the duties specified in the contract, i.e., the care and maintenance of the Hind machines to be purchased from His Majesty’s Government. (The possibility of this clause being extended to cover other machines in the possession of the Afghan Government might be considered, with a view to doing away with the necessity for an Italian or German Air mission.) [Hi) Instructors will not in any circumstances be employed to fly or accompany machines engaged in operations against the tribes in the case of internal disturbances, or in the event of war. (b) Rates of pay .—The Afghan Government usually pay their employees at the close of each month, and the rates might therefore be con veniently stated as monthly payments in sterling. (c) Allowances .—These should include :— (i) Provision of free furnished quarters. This is a necessary provi sion. The alternative of a house-rent allowance is undesirable since houses are difficult to obtain, and rents are liable to be exorbitant. -&gt; L-Jiu. a izn2 (n) Cost of passages. These should be for the return journey either from London to Kabul, or from London to I eshawar. In t ie latter case provision should be made tor tree transpoit, m accoid- ^ ance with the status of the employee, between Peshawar and Kabul. (nt) Travelling during the period of employment. This should provide for free transport for all journeys taken on duty in Atghamstan, and for travelling allowance for journeys if any perfoimed on duty outside Afghanistan. This allowance might be based on the Government of India’s scale of travelling allowance ox arranged to cover actual travelling expenses. (a) Period of contract. —This should be for one year (?) and renewable by mutual consent for a further period. As regards termination of the contract, attention is invited to Articles 7, 8 and 9 of the specimen contract below. It is believed that these aie the teims usually followed by the Afghan Government. It might perhapts be as weil to add to them that except in the case of termination by mutual consent or for misconduct three months notice will be given by the instructors and three months’ notice or three, months’ pay in lieu of notice will be given by edhei' tudrr. frLe, (e) Leave. —It is doubtful whether in the case ot a short contract for one vear, leave can legitimately be claimed. It might however be stipulated that after one year’s satisfactory work 20 days’ leave on full pay should be granted, whether the contract is renewed or not. (N.B .—The climate of Kabul is generally suitable for Europeans and leave for reasons of health could hardly be claimed except on medical certificate.) (/) Medical attendance—It should be stipulated that medical attendance either by the Legation Surgeon or at the Legation hospital should be permitted. An article, similar to xlrticle 10 of the specimen contract might be added. (Annexure II to Kabul despatch No. 71, dated 9th July, 1937.) Copy.

Your last letter on the subject No. HKJ/LC dated the 2nd March, 1937, did not specifically state the financial terms on which it would be necessary to base an offer, but some figures had to be put forward on the understanding that the mission was to have been organised by the Air Ministry. These figures were - A flying instructor - about £1,250 per annum Engineer specialist - £775 ' ” Engine and aircraft “ mechanics £550 ' w These figures were mentioned telephonically to someone at Messrs. Hawkers about the 17th March, when it was understood, without prejudice to future discussion that they appeared reasonable. You will remember that there have been several delays since then regarding the contract and in fact for the past six weeks the contract has been held up entirely owing to the question of these instructors. The Afghan Government's point of view has been that they cannot afford anything like the salaries which have been suggested, but after considerable discussion with the British Minister at Kabul they have at length agreed to provide a total sum of £3,125 per annum to cover four instructors, as set out above. e understand from Mr. Lucas that there may be difficulty in obtaining suitable men at this price, but it is also clear that it will be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to approach the Afghans again to increase the salaries unless we run a most serious risk of losing the contract altogether, or at any rate of allow ing a considerable further period of delay to set in. R.W. Sutton, Esq., Hawker Aircraft Limited, Camberley Park Road, KINGSTON-UPON-TKAMES. /2* ^ I 2* We understand from Mr. Lucas that it may be possible to obtain a good type of man for £1,300 for the pilot £800 for the senior mechanic and £750 for the other mechanics. We suggested that we might be able to deal with the difference of £475 between our figures by asking the Afghan Government to provide free accommodation in Kabul, but Mr. Lucas thought that such an arrangement would not be satisfactory to the mechanics themselves. We realise that good men are essential and to obtain good men good salaries are required, but the salaries now suggested are considerably higher than anything we had contemplated for similar personnel. We think it would be extremely difficult directly to ask the Afghans to raise their figure now, since they have only just agreed with considerable reluctance to the present figure after a great deal of pressure has been brought. Will you please consider what can be done to bridge the gap of approximately £450 per year which now separates us. I am sending a copy of this letter to Mr. Rumbold at the India Office.

The latter would be employed on up to date machines, and presumably the Afghan Government would wish to employ the pilot instructor^ at least not only for instructional duties but also to advise them generally in matters connected with their Air Force.

Walton, Esq., C.B., M.C., India Office, London.BY AIR MAIL British Legation, Kabul Semi-official No.1035. 16th March, 1937* Dear Collier, Kindly refer to your letter (N 659/70/97) dated 22nd February on the subject of Herr Hempel, the German pilot here. 2. My suggestion that Hempel might have been engaged to form the nucleus of an Afghan Civil Air Force was only a surmise, and I have myself been somewhat puzzled as to what his exact status here is to be. On receipt of your letter I thought the simplest thing to do would be to ask the Prime Minister, who was lunching with me on Saturday. He can usually be reckoned on to give a fairly straight answer. His Boyal Highness said that Hempel 1 s primary task was to get the two German Junkers, which have been here for years, into the air. After he had done that he would probably be employed as an instructor to teach Afghan pilots to fly these particular aeroplanes. It was not strictly correct to say that the Afghan Government proposed forming a separate civil air service at present. They had neither the men nor the money for such an undertaking. But he did propose to employ such aircraft as they possessed on civil duties, such as carrying mails or officials from one place to another. For these duties he would at present employ whatever aeroplanes were available and suitable. In time something in the nature of a civil air service might evolve, since he was anxious to link up internal Afghanistan by air as far as possible. L. Collier, Esq., C.M.G., 4#// Foreign Office, London.4 - 2 . 4. He was however quite definite that whatever Hempel*s job might be it would have nothing to do with any British air instructors who might be employed here. They would be under the Afghan air staff and no one else. suggested that my opinion of his intelligence must be very low if I imagined that he would be so foolish as to place employes of one foreign country under the direction of those of another in Afghanistan) that I do not think you need have any fear that Hempel will be allowed to interfere in any way with our people. As an additional safeguard it might be worth putting a clause into the contracts to the effect that the British personnel will be under the direction of the Afghan air staff only, or something of the sort. 6 .

Dear Fraser-Tytler, We were a libtle puzzled by the statement in paragraph 18 of the Intelligence Summary No.2 of your Military Attache enclosed in your despatch No.4 of the 13th January, to the effect that Herr Hempel is to act as pilot instructor in the Afghan Air Force. We previously understood from paragraph 4 of your telegram No .6 of the 6 th January that Herr Hempel’s activities were probably to be confined to civil aviation in Afghanistan. We shall be glad to know definitely what connexion, if any, Herr Hempel is to have with the Alghan military Air Force, since his position there might have some bearing on the question of sending British air instructors to Kabul. We might at least have to stipulate that British personnel, whether Royal Air Force or Hawkers, must not be subordinated to him. Could you send us your views on this aspect of his appointment? I am sending a copy of this letter to Rumbold. Yours etc. (Sd.) LAURENCE COLLIER. Lieutenant Colonel W. K. Fraser-Tytler, CMG., MC.L Dear Thank you for your letter of the 25th May regarding the supply to Afghanistan of certain aircraft and but a large noniber of political factors have arisen since our last discussion which have made this question of sale a great deal more complicated. influences which I have mentioned above, which has made the Afghan Governraent reluctant to come to a final conclusion has been that the Afghan Government decline^to conmit themselves to maintaining in Afghanistan any sort of mission which would permit their pilots and mechanics adequately to fly and maintain the Hind aircraft which you are providing. As you will remember, we had offered to give training at Karachi on the Afghan Government’s own Hinds, or alternatively to provide a mission to proceed to Kabul for this purpose. Kabul that the chief difficulty regarding the employment of British instructors was the financial one, and we have now suggested to the Afghan Government that instead of five instructors four would be sufficient - one flying instructor, one engineering specialist, one fitter and one rigger. if you could let us have your ideas regardin the content of contracts with the Af$ian Government for the employment at Kabul of personnel, which you undertook to provide if we asked you to do so. It seems that it may take some time to put these contracts into shape, and we do not want to have further delay at a later stage. What we want from you really is a rough sketch of the sort of points you^dealtwith.

Colonel Fraser Tytler, in his telegram No. 44 of Kabul telegram No. 48 of 3rd June. 5853 5000 3/37 25th May, replied to our telegram No. 52 of 20th May. He reported that the atmosphere for the discussion of aircraft negotiations at Kabul has been rendered rather more difficult by the propaganda activities of certain Tndiannewspapers, and recommended that he should merely explain to the Afghan Government the attitude of H. M.G. regarding the desirability of British instructors proceeding to Kabul, in order that the Afghan pilots and mechanics should be trained somewhere to fly and maintain the Hinds which we are selling to them, and that he should enquire what the intentions of the Afghan Government are in the matter. This accorded with the views of the Government of India. 3. It was thought here best to delay giving any instructions to Colonel Fraser Tytler until we knew how far we can satisfy the Afghan Government regarding newspaper propaganda; but on the 29th May the Prime Minister himself raised the question of the instructors in a friendly way. It is, therefore, suggested that we might now authorise H.M. Minister to discuss the matter further with the Afghan Government. 4. Muhammad Hashim appears to have agreed in principle to the employment of British instructors, but explained that provision was made in the Afghan budget for only three instructors on certain fixed salaries. The Afghan Legation originally asked for a party of six instructors. We said, in reply, that a party of five should suffice for their requirements, composed of one flying instructor, one engineering instructor, two mechanics and one instructor in signalling and meteorology. I have discussed the/2. the present position with the Air Ministry liaison officer. His view is that if a party of three is to go it should consist of one flying- instructor and two mechanics (which would cost about £70 per annum more than the Afghans offer), hut that a party of this size would not really he ahle to see that the aircraft were being properly looked after as well as to give the necessary instruction to the Afghan^ and that the addition of an engineering instructor is necessary. This party v/ould cost about £3,125 per annum against the £2,280 offered by the Afghan Government, (a difference of £845 per annum). 5. There can be no question of making any further financial concession to the Afghan Government in connection with these negotiations. They should be conten: to set the ext^s expenditure in respect of instructors against the very considerable unexpected saving which the Government of India’s increased credit enables them to make the sums to be paid on the aircraft and ancillary equipment. It is indeed not wise of them to boggle further over a sum of about £845, per annum, as Messrs. Hawkers have pointed out that the delay in the conclusion of their contract makes it doubtful whether they can obtain from their sub-contractors the prices and delivery arrangements which were originally offered, and from this point of view it is urgent in the interests of the Afghan treasury to conclude the negotiations. 6 .

Hawkers regarding the supply of aircraft for Afghanistan. They seem to me to be in a very unfavourable position. You will remember that we pushed them very hard some few weeks ago when Muhai.iaed Ihsam was bothering us and in consequence they went ahead and have actually started to modify the eight Hinds which Afghanistan require. V/e have heard nothing more from the General and Judging from the telegrams to and from Kabul it now seems quite possible that the Afghans will not proceed further with the purchase. Gould the Foreign Office not get into touch with Muhammed Ali, the Afghan Minister, and tell him that if the Afghans do not make up their minds soon Hinds not be available.^ H.A.F.

Dear Darvall, It is with the utmost reluctance that I am writing to you with regard to the delay in the receipt by us of contract instructions in respect of the supply to Afghanistan of eight Hind type aircraft, aircraft spares, engine spares, ancilliary equipment, and personnel. You will remember that in the later stages of the negotiations prompt delivery was clearly an essential condition, and we undertook a date which left us no spare time and one which depended upon there being no hitch in the arrangements we should require to make. In consequence we proceeded immediately with the modification of eight machines off an Air Ministry contract, and these are rapidly reaching completion. It has not been possible however, to place a firm order with the engine manufacturer for spares, neither have we taken steps to manufacture the aircraft spares. In the same way ancilliary equipment has not been ordered, and we now have grave doubts with regard to obtaining the prices or delivery which our suppliers originally offered unless we are placed in a position to pass our orders immediately. Similarly, although the machines may be ready, the question of personnel which has not been definitely fixed up is a serious one, as we do not find it easy in these days to secure suitable personnel at short notice for work in foreign countries. I am writing to you because I know from the hard work you have put into this y° u must be keenly interested that this series of negotiations should result in satisfaction to all concerned, particularly to the Afghanistan authorities. Therefore, I would ask you please to do something immediately to secure cover for us so that we may proceed to place the necessary orders with the suppliers and also to set about obtaining the various personnel.

Hawkers and the Afghan representatives in London of a draft contract for the purchase of aircraft equipment is in an advanced stage. The main point outstanding is in regard to the question whether all the material should be delivered at Kabul or whether part should be delivered at Karachi and used there in training Afghan aviators. 2. This difficulty arises as follows. On 24th November, 1936, the Afghan Minister asked whether we could send British air instructors to Kabul and for information regarding their cost. He was told in Foreign Office Notes of 1st February and 25th March of the way in which Messrs. Hawkers and the Air Ministry could meet this request, and we have since been waiting to learn whether the Afghans wish to accept our offer. The next step was that early in April Muhammad Ihsan explained that he could not agree to the Government of India’s proposal that some of the Hinds he is buying should be delivered at Karachi and used in the training of Afghan pilots and mechanics there, as the Afghan Government wished to exploit the propaganda value of the arrival of their Air Force in Kabul in a mint state and in one consignment. He explained that he himself contemplated that his pilots should be trained on Harts, Audax, etc., at Karachi, and converted to Hinds at Kabul by British instructors. After consultation with the Government of India and H.M. Minister, Kabul, the Afghan Minister in London was accordingly informed on 27th April that we would agree to the delivery of the Afghan aircraft being made at Kabul on the Sai'jB 5000 10/3G assumption/r ^ assumption that British instructors would he employed at Kabul. We therefore asked whether the Afghan Government, having considered our offer to provide these instructors and their approximate cost, had decided in principle to engage them, as pending their reply on this point, it was not possible to settle the wording of the clause in the draft contract re’garding the delivery of the material. Ali Mohammad has replied protesting against the signature of the contract for the purchase of the aircraft being made dependent on the employment of British instructors, and he says that he is referring the matter to his Government for orders. He has rather misread our attitude^which hitherto has been that we want the Afghans to choose between having their aviators trained at Karachi on their own Hinds X or accepting British instructors at Kabul. 3. Meanwhile, we have received secret information that in the middle of March the Afghan Government gave orders for negotiations to be started for the purchase of eight Italian aeroplanes of the latest model (to be paid for in kind in instalments) and sixteen, or at least eight, German aeroplanes, and a few days ago Muhammad Ihsan went to Berlin. The Air Ministry are justifiably apprehensive that both the Italians and Germans would wish to send air missions to Kabul to teach the Afghans to fly and maintain the aircraft fee They fear that the presence of several air missions in Kabul would lead to conflicting advice to the Afghan Government and to unpleasant incidents. This suggests that we should consider de novo what importance we should attach to the employment of British instructor at Kabul. It is clear that we cannot prevent the Afghans buying Italian or German machines but they seem determined to have some British machines, and we can use/ 9-1 y?Minute Paper. Department. 531'Jb 5000 10/3G use our knowledge of this to press them to give us our essential desiderata regarding the nationality of the instructors they employ at Kabul. 4. The first step is to get Colonel Fraser Tytler’s views and a draft telegram to him is submitted. As regards the positive suggestions on which we might consult him, the main alternative lines we might take with the Afghan Government appear to be:- (a) that we will not sell aircraft unless the Afghans employ British instructors at Kabul. This would be an extension of the attitude which we have hitherto adopted, i.e. that the Afghans must eith er employ British instructors or^ let their Hinds be used at Karachi. This line might result in as violent a reaction as there was from Shah Wall to our request for an assurance that the Afghans would rely mainly on British sources for their aviation requirements (Kabul telegram No.101 of 3rd November 1936), and there are also the general considerations against pressing British assistance on the Afghans referred to in Kabul telegram of 3nd -Oeptomb or 1936 (P. Z. 63 J 7 l i/36). But we would clearly be justified in insisting on British instructors being employed at Kabul (without giving the Afghan Government the alternative of allowing their Hinds to be used at Karachi) if the Afghans employ Italian or German instructors. (b) that we will not sell aircraft unless the Afghans undertake not to employ Germans or Italians (or Russians) in connection with their air force. This would give us our requirements of keeping out potentially hostile powers from undue influence in the Afghan Air Force and would leave it open to the A-fghan Government to/to employ French, Czechs, etc. The Afghan Government would, however, be likely to resent this kind of dictation i mch moro strongly than a condition that they should use British instructors for British machines sold to them by us. There j is also the danger that if we took this line they might decide to rely entirely on Germans and Italians in the lormation of| their air force. Indeed, the only way offering a chance of persuading them not to take a German or Italian mission might be (besides pointing out the danger of Soviet reactions; to lay our cards on the table and explain to them (if it is | a fact) that our own relations with Germany and Italy are such that we cannot afford to see nationals of those countries established in a position of miluence in the air ! force of so close a neighbour of ours as Afghanistan. This would clearly be difficult. 5 . Besides the draft telegram to Kabul, a draft telegram consulting the Government of India is also submitte The Air Ministry will need to be consulted on these draits, and this can be done at the same time as the minutes are copied to the Foreign Office. (Sgd.) H.A.F. Rumbold, 10.5.37. It seems clear that the probability, or even the possibility, of an Italian or German air mission, or both, at Kabul makes it all the more desirable that we should have: our own mission if possible; and if we sell our machines to the Afghans we could not unreasonably make it a condition that we should send a mission to instruct them how to ily them. On the other hand, the Afghans would surely feel, not unnaturally or unreasonably, the strongest possioie resentment if we tried to make it a condition that they should not employ Italian or German missions to give instruction on machines bought in Italy or Germany. (Employment/Department. ■sa C«.CiG Minute Paper. (Employment for such instructional purposes is of course not on a parlwith the manning of Amanullah's air force by I Russians, in connection with which we made certain representations in 1926.) If there are arguments of the highest political order, which we_ could take the ri.sh_Q.i. communicating to the . ifghanp. for using every means of excluding the possibility of Italian or German missions, then it is conceivable that by making such a communication to them, but not otherwise, we might possibly be able to persuade them. But the main point at the moment is whether we should not insist on the British instructors. ~ if. y. yi Draft Paper.

MINISTER, KABUL. Repeated to Government of India. of 16 th April and was asked whether the offer of British instructors and their approximate cost, have decided in principle to engage them. He was told it is impossible to settle the place of delivery for aviation equipment. He has replied protesting against the contract for the sale of equipment being thus made dependent upon the employment of British instructors and is referring to his Government for orders. 2. I suspect Minister of bluffing (as v/e now have reason to believe he was in insisting on credit for more than £45,000). He is of course misrepresent ing what he was told; and it would seem desirable not to leave Afghan Government under impression that we have aimed throughout at employment of British instructors at Kabul. You have therefore discretion, subject to considerations in following paragraphs, to point out that both offer to sell aircraft and that to supply instructors arose from enquiries by Afghan Kabul Afghan Government, having considered our Cypher XXX Copy to F.O. A.M. that pending the receipt of his reply 5973 5000 3.37 Governme nt/Department 2. Government, and that it was only when the Afghan Government objected to employment of their machines at Karachi that we stipulated for employment of British instructors at Kabul. We want to-secure that Afghans will in fact be able to fly our Hinds, and for this it is obvious that British training on them must be provided somewhere. 3. We have always been aware that Afghan Government might buy part of their requirements abroad (your telegram No.76 of 2nd September). As the Government of India know, there is now reason to believe that Afghan Government hope to buy eight Italian aeroplanes of latest model and sixteen, or failing that eight, German aeroplanes. If they make these purchases^ both Italy and Germany would presumably wish to send air missions to Afghanistan to teach Afghans to fly A- and maintain machines rbhey This prospect seems to emphasise importance of our requirement that British instructors should go to Kabul as otherwise field might be left clear for Italians and Germans.

Subject to your views on this point, it seems best for the reason indicated above to make the employment of British instructors a condition of the sale of British aircraft, at any rate if Italian or German instructors are employee^ I suppose that if we went further than this and suggested to the Afghan Govt, that if we sell any British aircraft, they should undertake not to employ German or* Italian instructors in their Air Force, the Afghan Govt, would be likely to react badly to such a proposal as an attempted interference in their own affairs^) But I should be glad of your views on this also.tNCJi_O^UH6 W FORC1QW OFFICE COVUSRIWO LETTER DATED copy (N 2346/2/97) No. ,J9. tr*l AFGHANISTAN LEGATION, 31, Princes Gate, S.W.7. 29th April,1937. / n ,ju n Sir, I have the honour of acknowledging the receipt of a letter No. N 2174/2/97 dated the 27th April, 1937; and in the first instance wish to express ray thanks for the consideration of the Government of India for agreeing not to retain any aircrafts for training Afghan students at Karachi, hut have the delivery of all material to he made direct to Kabul. In regards to the paragraph 3 of your letter, I may he permitted to observe that in all of my discussions, I had understood that the contract for the purchase of aircraft and material was not subject to any condition of employment of the British instructors; hut the purchasing of the aforementioned items was considered as a separate objective. But your letter makes it clear that the agreement for employing the instructors is now thought to he the first and the more important factor than the actual contract for buying of the material. Since, however, this is the decision of the Air Ministry, I have nothing to say hut to inform the department concerned at Kabul of the full details, and, shall, of course, communicate to you their reply upon the receipt of it. With the assurance, etc. (Signed) Ali Mohammad. Afghan Minister. His Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, The Foreign Office, LONDON, S.W.l.SECRET 28th April, 1937. You will no doubt have received in the last few days certain information which appears to foreshadow the purchase of aircraft by the Afghans from both Italy and Germany in addition to those which they are now negotiating for purchase from ourselves. We are a little anxious, if the Afghans are deteiriined to buy from these countries, as to the position of the British Mission to the Afghan Air Force, the despatch of which is now under active discussion, and is the chief stumbling block to the signing of the contract. You will appreciate that, in cormon with ourselves it is probable that, if the Germans and Italians provide aircraft for Afghanistan, they will insist on some of their own personnel being attached to the Afghan Air Force in the early stages to look after this equipment. In the case of Germany you will remember that a certain Mr. Hempel is already in Kabul undertaking the overhaul of the civil Junkers now in that country. It does not need a great deal of imagination to foresee considerable difficulty in the Afghan Air Force if the authorities are subject to advice from three separate countries, and in our view the position of our Mission might be extremely difficult and give rise to unpleasant incidents. Do you see any way in which we could raise this admittedly delicate matter with the Afghan Government, either through Fraser Tytler at Kabul, or through represen tations to the Afghan Minister in London ? •» Lawrence Collier, Esq., C.M.G Foreign Office, S.W.l.On the tecl:inical plane it has been represented to Muhannad Ishan that it would be most inadvisable to obtain aircraft equipment from different countries for the small Air Force which is all that Afghanistan can afford at present, and he appears to appreciate this most thoroughly. at the India Office and would be glad if you could let me have your views on action which you think *e could take* I am sending a copy of this letter to WaltonBefore the draft note could he sent to the Afghan Minister the First Secretary to the Afghan Legation came to see Mr. Vereker on April 24th and said that if, as Mohammad Ihsaa had gathered in conversations at the Air Ministry, the signature of the contract for the delivery of the eight aeroplanes was to be made conditional on the acceptance by the Afghan Government of British instructors at Kabul, the whole matter would have to be referred to Kabul with a consequent delay of anything up to three months, and Mohammad Ihsan would have to leave England for visits to ''other countries in Europe'. Juma Siddiqi, who had brought Ikbal Ali Shah with him to interpret, explained that it was not the question of money that disturbed his authorities, but that they had always regarded the questions of the purchase of aircraft, the training of Afghan pilots and the engage ment of British instructors as quite distinct and they did not want now to bind themselves to connect these arrangements. It would clearly be in the interests of the Afghan Government to engage British personnel to teach them to use the British aircraft, but they did not want to undertake to do so beforehand. Mr. Vereker read out the relevant parts of our draft note and explained that we were animated only by a desire to ensure that the Afghan Government should make the fullest use of our aircraft and that the Government of India, who were financing this project, had at first insisted that some of the aeroplanes should be kept at Karachi for training Afghan pilots on them there, and had only agreed that they should all be sent to Kabul if they could be assured that the engagement of British personnelpersonnel would give equal facilities for the training of Afghans there. We did not expect the Afghan Government to agree to the details of the contract for British instructors now, but only to say that they agreed in principle to take them. Apart from the Government of t i &lt;W v - &lt; ' India, Hawkers would probably insist on sending instruc- tors to Kabul in order to make sure that the aircraft gave satisfactory service. Ikbal Ali Shah suggested that it might be easier for the Afghan authorities to agree if we made it clear in our note that we only expected them to agree in principle and because it was in their own interest. A slightly modified version of paragraph 3 of the note was therefore suggested which would bring out these two points, but Juma Siddiqi was adamant and concluded the interview by saying that we had made it clear that the Foreign Office confirmed the impression derived from the Air Ministry that the two questions were definitely linked together, and that in these circumstances Mohammad Ihsan would have to leave and the negotiations be deferred.

You explained that the Afghan Government contemplated that after these students had been trained on Yapitis, Harts or Audax machines at Karachi they would be transferred to Hinds at Kabul by the British instructors who, as you have been informed, can be made available for that purpose. Government of India have been consulted on this point and agree that all the material which the Afghan Government are purchasing here may be sent*by Messrs. Hawkers direct to Kabul and should not be used for training purposes at Karachi, on the assumption that British instructors are employed at Kabul. The purpose of their original proposal was to ensure that the Afghan students would receive satisfactory training on Hind aircraft, none of wnich type exists in Indiaj and this point will be mot if personnel acquainted with Hinds are engaged to instruct these students at Kabul. It has been ascertained that personnel made available by Messrs. Hawkers on the lines described in the fifth paragraph of my Note N 1637/2/97 of the I now have the honour to inform you that the 25th/ Ali Mohammad Khan&gt; etc. etc etc.25th March last v/ould probably require remuneration on a similar scale to that necessary in the case of serving Royal Air Force personnel. An estimate of the cost to the Afghan Government of employing the latter was given in the fourth paragraph of my note N 531/2/97 of the 1st February last. 3. In these circumstances, and as the engagement of British instructors would be to the great advantage of the Afghan Government, I hope that you will be able to inform me at a very early date whether the Afghan Government, having considered the offer made to them, and the approximate cost to them of British instructors, have decided in principle to engage such instructors, as, pending the receipt of your reply on this point, it will not be possible to settle the wording of the clasue in the draft contract between Messrs. Hawkers and the Air Ministry regarding the delivery of the material. 4. In my note of the 1st February it was suggested that one instructor in signals and aerological duties together v/ould suffice for the requirements of the Afghan Government. The Air Ministry advise.me that in view of the small number of aircraft which will be at Kabul, one instructor should be able to carry out both auties; but if the Afghan Government wish to have two instructors, one for signalling and one for meteorological work, the Air Ministry will be willing to try to obtain them from among serving personnel of the Royal Air Force. 5. The Government of India are not yet in a position' to fix a date for the beginning of training at Karachi. In any/any case, hov/ever, on account of the arrangements which must he made, they could not receive the students before the latter half of May.

He points out difficulty of providing spares for Hinds or repairing them at Karachi. Afghan Minister at interview at Foreign Office on 12th April said that his Government insisted on aircraft being sent direct to Kabul otherwise Afghan people would not understand why the squadron did not arrive unused and complete. 2. I doubt whether Afghan Government will give way on this point on account of propaganda considerations. Also acceptance of Muhammad Ihsan’s suggestion would presumably influence Afghan Government to accept offer contained in paragraph 5 of Foreign Office note of 25th March (copy by secret air mail of 29th March) which has been referred to Kabul by Afghan Minister. Moreover difficult problem might arise if Afghan machine was damaged at Karachi e.g. by British pilot.

Muhammad Ihsan interview at the Air Ministry on 10/4 disclaimed all knowledge of proposal to complete the training of Afghan pilots on Afghan Hinds at Karachi. He contemplated completion of their training on Harts or Audax and conversion to Hinds at Kabul under the instructor whom Hawkers are ready to send there as leader of a British Mission. His view was that Afghan Government would never agree to the use of Afghan Hinds at Karachi for this purpose. He pointed out complications such as provision of spares, repairs, etc. for Afghan aircraft at Karachi. We are not clear as to the amount of training you propose to carry out on Kinds at Karachi, but on the assumption that previous training on Audax or Harts is necessary Ibsen*s proposals do not seem to be objectionable.% 5. of India *th« pilots «Yid«mtlp Tory unpractised, ^nd practically require training Initio ■ ThieVj will inTolTO us?o of our own airereft in initial «taf?«s. * finally, in prro.B of Wereign Offiso noto of 5th Doeuwhor 1936 to the Afghan Hinioter, it woo noid tH«t '‘The GoTorment ef India** Tehees* for treinin^ conter?' pi*to* thst it would be carried out mainly on the Afghan OovemsreBt’a own now m&amp;ehin#9** Therefore in accepting the achesse the Afghan Minister muat hare done ao with full ifnewledge of the position.

Sir, With reference to my note No.N 413/2/97 of the 1st February last, I have the honour to address you further on the subject of the purchase of British aircraft by the Afghan Government, in order to confirm the arrangements discussed with you at this department on the 23rd March. 2. It has been ascertained that Messrs. Hawkers would take payment for the aircraft and equipment required by the Afghan Government in two equal instalments, the second to be paid in April 1938 from the credit supplied by the Government of India. This being so, the Government of India have found it possible, in order to enable the Afghan Government to purchase a complete squadron of eight British aircraft and equipment, to make available, besides the sum of £45,000 mentioned in the second paragraph of my note under reference, a further sum of four lakhs of Indian rupees (£30,000) as a credit for the Afghan Government. I understand that, while the price quoted by Messrs. Hawkers for the material which the Afghan Government originally intended to acquire amounted to nearly £100,000, the contract at present contemplated is not likely to amount to much more than £80,000, and that your Government are prepared to pay in cash, as part of the first instalment whatever sum is required to make up the difference between the total credit of £75,000 offered by the Government of India and the total contract price eventually agreed. I shall be grateful to receive confirmation of your acceptance of this arrangement. Ali Mohammad Khan, 3/ etc., etc., etc.*3. As you were informed on the 23rd March the Government of India have only been able to offer the extra credit facilities now made available to your Government on the understanding that it will be impossible to consider any question of further credit to the Afghan Government for the purchase of war material before April 1939 at the earliest. 4. The position as regards the training of Afghan mechanics and pilots in India remains as stated in the fourth paragraph of my note of the 5th December last, as modified by the fourth paragraph of my note of the 1st February last; that is to say, the Government of India are prepared to train ten pilots and ten mechanics, since the Afghan Government have agreed to take advantage of the credit now offered to them and to purchase a squadron of eight aircraft and equipment in the United Kingdom. I understand that your Government would like this training to begin as soon as possible. 5. With reference to my note No. N. 531/2/97 of the 1st February last, I have the honour to inform you that Messrs. Hawkers have now stated that they could make available certain British personnel for service with the Afghan Air Force. They could provide a flying instructor, an instructor with specialised engineering qualifications and two individuals for workshop maintenance and electric work; and if the Afghan Government definitely decide to employ British personnel, the Air Council would endeavour to obtain a volunteer from among serving personnel of the Royal Air Force to act as instructor in signal and aerological duties. I trust that these arrangements will meet the requirements of the Afghan Government and I shall be glad to learn whether they desire to take advantage of them. 6. As was arranged at this department on the 23rd March, the /3. the Air Ministry will proceed immediately to draft a contract to be signed by them and Messrs. Hawkers for the purchase of the material required by the Afghan Government, and will submit it to Muhammad Ihsan Khan for his approval before signature. When the main lines of this contract are clear, His Majesty's Government will at once draft an agreement to be entered into by themselves and the Government of India on the one side, and the Afghan Government on the other side, providing for the cash payment by the Afghan Government of whatever sum is necessary to make up the price of the contract beyond the amount of the credit offered by the Government of India, and for the repayment of that credit in six equal annual instalments, the first instalment of payment for each part of the order falling due on the date on which the consignment in question is shipped from Londo n.

November to the Foreign Office (P.Z.8466/36) the Afghan Minister said that his Government desires to employ several British nationals in various branches of air services. He asked for suitably qualified candidates to be recommended,for an estimate of their qualifications and for their terms of service, have assumed that the experts were required in connection with the development of the new Afghan Air Force more than with civil aviation. 2. The views of H.M.Minister, Kabul, (P.Z.9115/36) of the Government of India (P.Z.33/37) and of the Air Ministry (P.Z.925/37) have been obtained. All are in favour of giving a favourable answer to the Afghan request. 3. The Afghan Government are apparently not afraid o — of the effect on Russian Afghan relations of the employment of British experts, and probably the Soviet Government would prefer to see British rather than Germans (who are the most likely alternative) in charge of the development of the Afghan Air Force. One German pilot and two German mechanics have already been engaged by the Afghans, probably in connection with civil aviation (P. Z. 164/37). Perhaps therefore we need not fear that the employment of British experts would have adverse reactions on Russo-Afghan-British relations, although it might of course give a handle to propaganda against the Afghan Government. Presumably the Afghan Government have taken this last consideration into account. 4. Until quite recently we have not encouraged European British subjects to take service under the Afghan Government, partly because a policy of friendly detachment towards development in Afghanistan seemed best and partlybecause of the adverse conditions to which foreign employees of the Afghan Government were subjected. The right policy now seems to be,while not going out of our way to press British subjects to take service under the Afghan Government (or to live in Afghanistan in pursuit of trade, etc.),to raise no objection to their doing so, provided that they are personally suitable. It seems, however, necessary to consider each case on its merits and to seek an opportunity to advise British subjects taking service under the Afghan Government as to the safeguards which it is desirable that they should secure in their contracts. It would not benefit our prestige in Afghanistan and tribal territory if many European British subjects lived in Kabul under the conditions « which Germans and others are content to accept. The letter sent to the Overseas Nursing Association in April 1936 (P. Z.2936/36),regarding a project(which was not pursued^ fo r a British nurse to go to Kabul is relevant. In that case the advantages of a British subject being employed were small, but in the present case the advantages of the development of the Afghan Air Force being in British hands are so substantial that the old standing considerations against meeting the Afghan request may perhaps be . It would, of course, be necessary to scrutinise the contracts of the instructors and in particular to secure, as the Government of India suggest, that they should not take part in air operations in Afghanistan. 5 . The Air Ministry consider that it would be preferable for serving rather than ex-service or 8 ,e serve personnel to be employed, and are willing to ask for volunteers. A few years ago ex-Service personnel were employed in Saudi Arabia and the experiment was not a success. Moreover I understand that most of the suitable ex-ServiceMinute Paper Department. ex-Service personnel have now teen reabsorbed into the R.A.F. It is suggested that we should accept the Air Ministry view, as we would have a greater hold over serving personnel, although their employment, however disguised, increases the chances of the Russians being spurred into counter-activity. 6 .The Afghan Government are only too likely to be unable to pay the financial terms which would be required and the scheme is unfortunately likely to fall through for this reason. It may consequently be desirable to Afghan Minister’s questi.ons, leaving it to be assumed that the Afghan Government will pay. 7. Authority is sought to iw&amp;awaa the Foreign Office when we receive the recommendations of the Air Ministry regarding the terms of service which it would be necessary to offer,that Ali Muhammad should be informed that H.M.G. would be prepared to try to obtain volunteers from among serving personnel of the R.A.F.; that the requirements of the Afghan Government could probably be met by the party suggested in the Air Ministry letter of 12th January, and that he should also be told of the terms of service^which the Air Ministry promise us in letter that they will * at recommend*, as.

They must buy to suit their puree* 4„ I said my Government looked on the matter from a practical point of view* Training of twenty pilots and mechanics would cost one lakh and would be largely wasted if they were then to use entirely different type of aircraft* we were meet anxious to help to bui3d up efficient air force in Afghanistan, value of which we fully recognised, but nothing was less Hkely to be efficient than an air force composed of aircraft supplied by three or four different countries, 5* Prime Minister admitted the force of these arguments but asked that further discussion should be deferred till the return in about a fortnight’s time of ghah Mahmud., whose recent experiences in Europe would enable him to advise on the question* 6, It is not easy to prediot line the Afghan Government will take.

I reported briefly in my telegram of August 22nd (Katodon Nos. 73 and 74) the reasons which led up to the visit of two British military aeroplanes to l&amp;st week and the results of that visit. The whole incident is I think of sufficient interest to report in rather more detail than I was able to give within the compass of a telegraphic message. 2. I have alreadv reported in my despatch No. 108 that Sardar Faiz . imammad, the r oreign Minister, had been obliged to put off his projected .journey to Geneva ^ via Moscow. He was present for the first three days of Jhe Festival of Independence and then left Kabul on August 17lh on^ the first stage of his journey to Herat. What happened next is not very clear, but it appears that at his first uu mg place he fell in with a doctor to whom he related as an interesting story how he, his family and some of his servants had been bitten or licked a few days before by one of his dogs which had then died of rabies. The doctor took, as he well might a senous view of the case, told him to return at once to Kabul and proceed with his family and all speed to the nearest Pasteur Institute. Even m the most serious situation Faiz Muhammad can never, in mv mind, entirely d i V fn t T imsef h ? bitual cap and bells, and the idea of this would be reformer rr e 2” Ue ^ a ^ 1 . ons &gt; turned at any rate temporarily from his purpose bv the hck of a pet spaniel, and hastening back through the gorges of the Hindu Kush to the afflicted family he never should have left, is not without an element o comedy. But it was tragic enough for Faiz Muhammad who by the time he reached Kabul at midday on August 18th had fallen into that state of panic habitual to persons who never face disagreeable facts until these are forced upon them. He proceeded to prepare himself and his young family in all haste toi their long riot journey to Kasauli and sent urgent requests to this Legation for visas and other facilities. ^^ 1 »&gt;. Ihese requests Were complied with, but a chance remark bv the Legation burgeon, that it would be much simpler to have the anti-rabic vaccine sent to Kabul, prompted me to make this suggestion to the Prime Minister when I met him a few hours later on the festival ground. He accepted the proposal with aldd it&gt; and added, as I hoped he would, the suggestion that the vaccine should oe sent oy air. ^ 4. Its arrival, less than 24 hours after this conversation produced a profound impression in Goveu.ment circles in Kabul, and I have already reoorted the message of thanks which the Prime Minister asked me to convey to the Govern- ment of India. I have now the honour to forward as an enclosure to this despatch a e ei have received from the Foreign Minister couched in similar terms To these messages I may perhaps be permitted to add an expression of mv own gratitude for the rapidity and adequacy of the action taken. Apart from anv material value which may result from this incident there is nothing that oils the v heels of our relations with the Afghan Government more effectively than a personal service of this nature promptly and generously rendered. fr, 5 A The rTOver ? m £ nt of India gave me discretion to detain the aeroplanes foi a day or two m Kabul for demonstration purposes. I was a little doubtful low the Prime Minister would view such a proposal at a time when Kabul was hill to overflowing with visitors to a festival designed to celebrate Afghanistan’s independence from British influence. There was also the question whether such demonstrations would no serve to stimulate the zeal of other foreign represent fW- Wh °? °r rT1 “ T ere also h °P in S to sell aeroplanes to the Afghan Gm eiiiment Against fins however was the consideration that if I refused to allow the Afghan Air Force to witness a demonstration at least of the Audax iy\ vould be strengthened m their suspicions that we were trying to palm off on then, machines of inferior quality. I therefore approached the Mme Minister on the siib.iect while making it quite clear to him that the machines were at his disposal only if he wished his officers to see them Thev wrmbl nflm return at once to India. Any doubts His Highness m^ have L o thi wore overcome by the obvious eagerness of the Afghan Air Force 0 see somf thing ot the types of machines whose merits were at the mnmonf +Un i • J 110 * discussion between our two Governments, and he accepted the proposal without2 6. The demonstrations took place the following morning and the favourable impression already created by the timely visit of these two aircraft was enhanced by the patience and courtesy shown by Squadron Leader Butler and his two officers in answering innumerable questions in regard to the details and performance of the machines and in taking up several of the officers of the Afghan Air Force on demonstration flights. It was noticeable that though flights over the city were not permitted, the Afghan officers asked to be taken over the area where the festival was in progress thereby adding an unexpected item to the entertainments of the day, and treating the public of Kabul to a display of aeronautic skill such as they can never before have witnessed. Squadron Leader Butler is I understand submitting a report to the Government of India on his mission, but I forward for your information an account by the Military Attache, Major Lancaster, who acted as interpreter, giving some details of these demonstrations. 7. I had an opportunity of presenting the pilots to the Prime Minister the same evening, when His Highness thanked them personally for the admirable manner in which they had carried out their mission. They left next morning on their return flight to India. 8. Two incidents connected with this visit are perhaps worthy of record. Colonel Benedictov, the Russian Military Attache, asked particularly to be allowed to see the machines at close quarters, stating that he had on a previous occasion granted a similar request to Major Lancaster’s predecessor. After ascertaining from Squadron Leader Butler that all details of the make and performance of the machines were public property, I gave the necessary permis sion, subject to the concurrence of the Afghan authorities. This was obtained with the proviso that Colonel Benedictov should on no account be taken up for a flight. He was allowed a brief inspection after the Commandant and officers of the Afghan Air Force had been “ At Home ” to the Military Attache and the British Royal Air Force Officers, and at a time when no Afghan officers were near the machines. He subsequently informed a member of the diplomatic corps who passed on the remark to me that he had been agreeably surprised to learn that the radius of action of these machines would not take them over the Russian frontier and back, “ thereby showing that Great Britain was no longer main taining her aggressive attitude against the Soviet ” ! The other incident was a remark by the Persian Ambassador congratulating me on the speedy arrival of the aeroplanes which had thwarted the Russian Ambassador’s endeavour to persuade Faiz Muhammad to let him send for an aeroplane to convey him and his family to Tashkent. M. Bahman added that the fact that they would almost certainly have found no anti-rabic vaccine on arrival had not seemed to affect the eagerness with which M. Skwirsky had pressed his proposals. 9. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Secretary of State for India and to the Government of India. (Enclosure 1 to Kabul despatch No. 119, dated 26th August 1936.)

Letter from the Military Attache, British Legation, Kabul, to His Majesty's Minister, Kabul, dated the 24th August 1936. t have the honour to submit herewith a report on the visit of the two British aircraft to Kabul from 19th to 21st. August and the inspection of the aircraft by the Commandant and officers of the Afghan Air Force on 20th August.3 Report on the Inspection of two British Aircraft by the Commandant and Officers of the Afghan Air Force and the demonstration of the capabilities of the Aircraft on 20th August 1936. 1. The aircraft, one Audax and one Hart, arrived in Kabul from Peshawar al 1600 hours Kabul time on 19th August. The time taken to complete the .journey was one hour and fifteen minutes. Sqdn. Leader J. H. Butler, Flight Lieut. C. M. Heard, Flying Officer W. D. Anderson, D.F.C., and Aircraftsman Duff accompanied the aircraft. .The primary object of the visit was to bring anti-rabic vaccine for the Afghan Minister for Foreign Affairs. The aircraft on arrival were parked on the Sherpur Aerodrome, and a guard of 1 officer and 30 men of the Afghan Army was posted over them. On the evening of 19th August the Afghan Prime Minister readily accepted the offer of His Majesty’s Minister to show and demonstrate the aircraft to the ( ommandant and officers of the Afghan Air Force on 20th August. The time for the inspection and demonstration was fixed for 0830 hours. 2. On 20th August the Royal Air Force officers and the aircraftsman, accompanied by the Military Attache proceeded to the Sherpur Aerodrome, where they were met by the Commandant and 21 officers of the Afghan Air Force. A thorough inspection of the two aircraft was then made, and the capabilities, performance and individual technicahties of both the Hart and the Audax were carefully explained. The Commandant and officers were intensely interested in both aircraft, and began by showing a decided preference for the Hart, but later after one or two demonstration flights had been carried out by the Audax, opinion changed in favour of the latter aircraft. During the inspection and explanation the following points emerged which indicate to some extent the lines on which the Commandant and officers of the Afghan Air Force are thinking : (a) They showed a marked preference for a Rolls Royce engine possibly because they have very little knowledge of other types, and it would appear that if they buy aircraft from Great Britain they would prefer to have this type of engine. (b) They were especially interested in the number of flying hours each aircraft could do before it was necessary to send the engine, or body of the aircraft to a depot tor overhaul. They apparently contemplate the engagement of an expert mechanic and a fitter from the firm supplying the aircraft, and intend them to start a work shop at the Sherpur Aerodrome. (c) They are only interested in aircraft which have a ceiling of 20,000 feet and thus able to cross the Hindu, Kush. (d) They require aircraft which have a range of over 400 miles prefer ably 500 miles so that non-stop flights can be made from Kabul to Kandahar, Herat or Mazar-i-Sharif. (e) They showed no interest in the D. H. 89 type of aircraft, and all their questions were regarding two-seater aircraft for reconnais sance, day and night bombing, fighting, and photographic duties. (/) They asked a number of questions concerning the type of aircraft now in use in India mainly I consider with a view to finding out whether we were attempting to sell them aircraft with an inferior performance to those in use in India. They were evidently anxious to obtain aircraft having an equal performance. Thev also asked about the type of aircraft now in use in Iran, and stated that they wished to bu\ aiiciatt vInch are equal it not superior in perform ance to those in use in Iran. They mentioned that the recent Helmand water dispute had led them to consider how inferior they would be in the air should a clash occur between Iran and Afghanistan. (g) Having discovered as a result of their inspection of the Audax and Hart and a demonstration of the performance of the Audax (an aircraft about which they had little or no previous knowledge) that we were genuinely trying to sell them reasonable aircraft their suspicions were allayed, and they began to take an interest in theHind aircraft. Details of the Hind aircraft and its performance so far as these were known were then given to them, and they asked that further particulars be sent to them as soon as possible. i 1 1&gt; ‘ T P emons trations were then given of the performance of both the Audax and the Hart. The Gommandant of the Afghan Air Force, Ghund Mishar (Brigadier) * J} lamma d Ihsan Khan, was given a trial flight in both aircraft and 7 other officers were also given short flights. ii rn^ 10 P lio f s T W ei * e asked not to fly over Kabul city, but were invited to fly over ie Idiaman-i-Hazuri where the Independence Celebrations were in progress. At the request of the Commandant of the Afghan Air Force a short demons tration ot acrobatics was given by the pilot of the Audax, and this perhaps u n anything else changed their attitude towards this type of aircraft. , s the iiart had a wireless set fitted, and it would have meant removing the natteries no acrobatics were carried out by this aircraft. The Commandant and officers of the Afghan Air Force then stated that they were perfectly satisfied with their inspection of the aircraft and the demonstra- tions given, and asked the Military Attache to express their thanks to the Koval An .b orce officers for the patience and goodwill with which they had answered tiieir various questions regarding the two aircraft. Thev also said that they were very much impressed with the skill of the pilots and the performance V tne two aircraft. J The inspection and demonstration was completed at 1230 hours. &gt;7!' e y om ™ andan t and offlcers of the Afghan Air Force were then “ At o l 0 t &lt;he 0 * cers ^e Royal Air Force and the -Military Attache at their Vml X b n i mr P&gt;;ovided.

He was told that the manufacturing companies did not make reductions unless full payment was made on delivery, and in this ease it would be a malter for the two Govern- ments concerned to decide. (b) The Commandant asked what equipment would be supplied (i) T\ ith each aircraft and included in the cost price of the aircraft. (U) With each aircraft, and included in the price of £600 for military equipment. Squadron Leader J. H. Butler took down details and has promised to forward particulars to this Legation. (c) The Commandant asked that if they decided to send 10 pilots and 10 mechanics to India for training where would thev undergo their training. He was told that they would probably go'to Karachi. (d) The Commandant stated that he would be discussing the question of the purchase of aircraft with his Government in a day or two and would let me know if he required further information.

Afghan Consul-General has not replied to our reference regarding pilots, perhaps because none have yet been secured. If, however, Britishers offer themselves ; it seems hardly feasible to do more than emphasise the peculiar risks they run; warning them that acceptance of employment under Afghan Government must be on their own responsibility, and that the British Government would be unable to intervene on their behalf should they, for instance, fall into the hands of Afghan tribesmen if engaged in operations against them. To refuse /this permission to cross the frontier would surely constitute interference with British trade, placing it at serious disadvantage compared with the trade of other European countries, and it would also appear unfriendly in the eyes of the Afghan Government.

' Reference to previous correspondence: Kabul telegram No. 164 dated 27th August 1924. Description of Enclosure. Name and date. Subject. To: Government of India. Memorandum No. 693 dated 30th August 1924. Engagement by Afghan Government of British civilian personnel for Afghan air service. Copies also sent to: Secretary of State for India. Government of India (without enclosures).From: R.R.Maconachie, -^sq., I.C.S., His Majesty^ Charge' d'Affaires, Kabul. To: The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and political Department, Simla. Memorandum No. 693. Dated Kabul, the 30th August 1924. Reference my telegram No. 164 dated 27th August 1924. I understand that there would be no objection in international law to the employment by the Afghan Government of British civilian personnel as pilots for service during the present operations in Khost and that the question is therefore purely one of political expediency. 2. The following considerations appear to me to render the proposal highly undesirable from the point of view c£ British interests in this country:- (1) Afghan public opinion would regard British civilian pilots, even if privately engaged by the Afghan Government, as camouflaged officers. His Majesty's Government would Lherefore be generally considered to be definitely participating in a civil war in Afghanistan. (2) The employment of British pilots for this purpose would be most unpopular in Kabul, not only among the Mullahs, but with all classes of the people (vide Diary of the Military Attache', Kabul, No. 32, para. 5). (3) There would be constant friction between the pilots and the Afghan Government owing to the impossible demands made by the latter, and their habitually overbearing behaviour/behaviour towards their foreign employes. Such friction is already noticeable in the case of the German air personnel. (4) Unless a staff of British air mechanics were also engaged, the machines would soon become ineffective, and if at that time these were being flown by British pilots the latter would be held responsible and British prestige would suffer accordingly. In this connection, reference is invited to the enclosed copy of my letter dated 18th August 1924 to the officiating Foreign Minister. (5) In the event of a forced landing by British pilots in the area occupied by the rebel forces. His Majesty^ Government would find it difficult, in my opinion, to avoid participation in negotiations for their release, or if the pilots were killed by the rebels, to retain an attitude of complete aloofness. (Sd.) R.R.Maconachie, His Majesty^ Charge d'Affaires, Kabul. Attested. (Sd.) W.K.Fraser-Tytler, Secretary, British negation, Kabul.Copy of letter dated 18th August 1924 from His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires, Kabul, to the officiating Aighan Foreign Minister, Your Excellency mentioned to me today a proposal by the Afghan Government to engage British civilian pilots for employment in the Afghan Air Force. I have discussed the question with Wing Commander Johnston, who tells me that, so far as he is aware, there are no civilian pilots at present in India, and if there were any these would not accept employment in Afghanistan until they were assured that the machines they were to fly were being adequately maintained by a trained staff of mechanics. This confirms my own impression, which 1 have previously mentioned to you, that the proper maintenance of any aeroplanes which the Afghan Government may purchase is a matter of the first importance which requires to be borne in mind from the outset.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000220_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/2006</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000220</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/2006</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 5/53 ‘Afghanistan: Employment of British nationals in various branches of the Afghan air services; Air instructors’ contracts’</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1935/1943</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2016-12-20T00:26:32</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">per</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (596 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence commences at the inside front cover with 1, and terminates at the last folio with 596; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.

It predominantly documents the employment of civil aviation instructors from Hawker Aircraft Limited and Rolls Royce Limited to provide training to the Afghan Air Force. This includes the process of recruiting the instructors, negotiating their terms and conditions, drafting their contracts, renewing their contracts, replacement of staff, and issues arising during the course of their employment. A number of draft contracts can be found within – in some cases both English and Persian language versions of the contract are included.The instructors are employed in connection with the purchase of eight Hawker Hind aircraft in 1937, and correspondence relating to this purchase can also be found within the file. There is also some discussion surrounding the question of policy regarding the employment of British nationals in Afghanistan.The majority of the correspondence is between officials of the Foreign Office (Laurence Collier), the India Office (predominantly Horace Algernon Fraser Rumbold and George Edmond Crombie), HM Minister at Kabul (William Kerr Fraser-Tytler), and the British companies concerned. However, contributions from officials of the Air Ministry, the Afghan Legation in London, and officials of the Government of India have also been filed within.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year.
