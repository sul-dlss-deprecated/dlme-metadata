Sir, I have the honour to refer to your memorandum Ko. 4301/7/CE dated the 29th March, 1944. 2. I note that in the case of the landing grounds at Doha and *as Island a report on the physical condition of the surface is required and in the case of Abu Dhabi a considerable extension of the present alighting area is desired. I regret that I have no skilled engineer whom I can depute to examining these alighting areas and in the case of Doha and las Island I have no means of transport to enable a member of my staffjto carry out an inspection. 3. 1 suggest that as regards Abu Dhabi it would be advisable for a representative of the Hpyal Air Force to visit the landini; ground as soon as possible and I shall be very willing to arrange for the Political Officer Truclal Coast to accompany him so that if it is decided that the landinr ground can be extended then the Political Officer will be able to complete arrangements with the Shaikh and obtain the estimate for the cost of the repairs which you desire. Alth regard to /as Island will it not be possible for you to arrange to fly an OiTicer there to •xaalns the surface and the possibility of increasing the allehtint; area? If this could bo done I shall then be in a position to ask the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, to whom the Island belongs, if he will undertake the work. Doha will not I think present very much difficulty and I suggest that the same procedure be adopted as that advocated ■i ■ /InIn the case of las Island, 4, While very willing to £:ive you every possible assistance I raust make it clear that I cannot make available anyone to supervise the work nor can I guarantee in any way the standard of the work which the Shaikhs oay do.

The markings on the landing ground are dirty and would be difficult to see from the air, the ground is over grown with small bushes, the petrol store is empty and unlocked, and the shelter for air crews is in disrepair. 2. Of the 10 rifles given in 1956 to the Regent of Kalba for the protection of the aerodrome none remain. All are reported to have been sold. The one rifle given to Shaikh Khalid remains with one of Shaikh Sacp^s (brother of HUmaid bin Abdullah) servants. 3. The air agreement signed in Au^nist 1936, was to remain in force for a period of 12 years and, unless renewed, will lanse this year. 4.

Memorandum . • Reference Residency endorsement No.B/198, dated the 26th June, 1948. 2. The Chief Engineer 1 s letter is entirely outside the point. There is, as far as I know, no R.A.F. Rest House at Dubai. There is a small B .O .A.C. Rest House on the Jetty (i.e. on land rented from the Shaikh of Dubai under the Commer- £ cial Air Agreement with him, vide correspondence ending with Agency Printed Letter No.C/R-78, dated the 16th June, ly48). This agreement provides that on the termination of the lease (it has been renewed and is still current), buildings will revert to the Shaikh. &gt; No Tapu Deeds exist and it is im possible to get one as there are no Land Departments in Dubai or in any other Trucisl State. If the re ference is to the B.O.A.C. Rest House, I am afraid that I cannot undertake to have a plan made out. The R.A.F. had A.M.W.D. officials at Sharjah and if they have not one now, can easily fly one there to make a plan. (SGD) C.J. PELLY Political Agent, Bahrain.
