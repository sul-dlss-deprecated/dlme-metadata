Ir, I have tha honour to rofer to the sainutea of th© mating hold tn tha external Affairs Diprxrtmnt on Tuesday the 11th i&gt;«cee*har 1.46, to consider the question of civil aviation between India and erslan and to say that I discussed the question of these proposed sir routes at a meeting with £ir Ouruneth Bewoor and ;&gt;lr Frederick Tyams during nf recent visit to Jeihi. 4^ Um l {minted out Umt the proposed route (1) was a roundabout method of reaching Tehran and added that so far as (2) was concerned little payload co ild be excected along the onth Persian coast and that the traffic between Bushlre, hhiras, Isfahan and Tehran would almost certainly be closed to an Indian line as a Parslan line is already operating on this sectl «• I added with regard to the Air Attache*s objections regerdk Ing the fsountainous country between Jhiraz and Isfahan, that this Parsian air line was alre dy covering it with out difficulty, and that 16 years a*:o Junkers had apparently experienced no difficulty with the primitive aeroplanes then available. As regards (3) and (4), I felt that I could offer no useful suggestions. 3. I then drew attention to an excellent open- ins,; which existed for an Indian air line along the Arab shores of the Persian Gulf, The requisites of a /between halts profitable air line are that the distances/shouic oot be too great, and that traffic should readily be available at ^ all tha stapes. I suggest, therefore, that the Government of India should encourage an air line to fly to Basra stopping at Jlwwni, hharjah, Bahrain, Kuwait and finally Basra. 4. The present atearer service to uwad’ir Is very | oor and there is little doubt that an air line would attract a considerable amount of air nail. In addition to such passengers as could not wait for a ship. It Is true that the distance fro* Ovador to Jiwanl is consid erable, and at present owing to the indifferent nature of the road takes sotae 6 hours, but this would not affect air mall and passengers would be prepared to face this. The aerodrome at Jlwanl is presumably the property of the Government of India and they could make their own terms /for an * Confidential. Bahrain receipt. MMHMBA.for an air line. Should it be possible to utilise the aerodrome at Gwadur* still more traffic would be avail able, but in any case this distance provides a useful refuelling stop for the more economical types of aircraft. 5. At Sharjah, this air line could land simply by paying landing fees to His Majesty^ Government who already maintain and administer the aerodrome and have an agreement with the Shaikh of that place. fhere is a large Indian community both here and In Dubai who already appreciate air facilities, and in addition the Indian ; ost Office at Sharjah or Dubai would naturally sent their postal packets, which can be quite considerable, by an Indian air line, which would be fully justified since Indian internal air postage rates are now charged. 6 . At Bahrain, the air line could land on similar terms and little expenditure would be required. Here again there is a very large Indian community, a close c onnection with Karachi and Bombay, an Indian Post Office which would make available large quantities of postal air mail packets to and from India, and finally an Arab community fully alive to the advantages of air travel and the disadvantages which they now experience in endeavouring to secure passages on long distance aeroplanes. 7. * At Kuwait the aerodrome is not at present maintained, but it is an all-weather aerodrome (regularly used by Kuwait Oil Company planes up to Lockheeds) which has very seldom gone out of order, and meteorological reports of Basra would with very occasional exceptions^ suffice for Kuwait. Here a good deal of traffic could be expected since not merely is there an Indian Post Office which would provide a quantity of air mail, but there is a growing Indian community based upon the Kuwait Oil Compaay. An air line landing here would be most popular with trie Arabs in that they would not be obliged, as they are at present, to wait a month for a visa to Iraq in order to fly from Basra. The distance from Kuwait to Basra is a very short one but the traffic that Kuwait would provide w ould fully justify a halt here. S. Basra is the logical terminus of this line and medium-sized aircraft could continue to land in the Basra air port Margil. There can be no doobt that with the close and rapidly increasing trade links that Iraq is forging with India, Basra would provide a considerable number of passengers, and in addition at certaii times there would be a very large pilgrim traffic which might call for extra planes. 9. To sum up, this air line would only be required to fly short distances, through areas with large Indian interests and Indian Post Offices, and with a population well accustomed to air travel,. Potential passengers are at present badly served owing to the ±act that the existing air lines cater to long distance travellers and give them preference over local traffic. / If the■ (9 - 3 - If the Grovernment of India are contemplating any air lines outside their territories, I feel that this is the one which is best adapted to their purpose and which will yield the best revenue with the least outlay of capital.

R.A.F. are abandoning rooms used for accommodation of air passengers at Muharraq. They suggested to Bahrain Government that they should take them over and provide board and lodging for passengers there but Bahrain Government were unwilling to accept responsibility. I understand that ARAMCO are now likely to take them over as a rest hou«e for their personnel who constantly visit Bahrain for change of air and recreation. In these circumstances air passengers will not be able to make use of them. 3. It appears likely that both an Indian service and Iraq Airways will shortly be using huharraq aerodrome regularly. Further we have a number of casual visitors. ' For instance the French bar Minister probably with a large party is spending the night of May 3rd/4th here. B.O.A.C. accommodation on main island is already inadequate for flying-boat passengers for whom Bahrain is now a regular night stop. 4.

The Ministry, therefore, request the esteemed Embassy to be so good as to intervene with the competent quarters in India with a view to obtaining the necessary permission for the purpose of taking the said cargo from Iraq, Bahrain and Sharjah to Karachi, and also from Karachi to Iraq, Bahrain and Sharjah. It is probable that the said air service will be run twice weekly. The Ministry will furnish the esteemed Embassy in due course with the necessary details concerning the date of commencement of the said service and the type to the aeroplane to be used in this service. In awaiting a reply, the Ministry avail themselves of the opportunity to express their highest consideration and esteem.

The Embassy proposes therefore to wait for three months and if expected constitutional developments have then been completed to take the matter up with the authorities concerned.

Station Superintendent, Eanrain, irom Lee, the Manager of the Southern Asia area. It would appear that the only service which would have any chance of success would be one between Bahrain and Karachi using a small type of aircraft e.g. a Dove, and calling at Sharjah, Muscat and Gwadur en route. Before this could be established it would be necessary to do a good deal of work on the landing grounds at Muscat and Gwadur and to inst- al some kind of ground organisation at both these places. 3 -. 1 should be grateful if you could make such enquiries as are possible and je t me have a rough estimate of the traffic, e.g. passengers, freight and mai^s, uiiat would ue likely to offer for such a ser~ vice at the landing grounds in your Agency. Kuwait and Baghdad and I understand their planes are usually half empty. Some time ago there was talk of an Indian line operating a service up the Gulf but I have discussed the question with Parker. 4. Iraqi Airways are already operating between Bahrain *30th December, 1947 The Political Resident, P.G., Bahrain. Sir, LOC ^L SbRVICbS IN THE PERSIAN GULF I have the honour to refer to my recent interview with you at which the above was discussed. 2. As instructed, I am now writing to you officially on tms matter and deel that I can do no better than enclose a copy of the relative letter from the Manager of our Southern Asia Area. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your obedient servant, Sd/- G-F.i/i. Parker Station Superintendent. ' LB 1BRITISH OVERSEAS AIRWAYS CORPORATION PiE M GRAND UM From: Manager Southern Asia Area, To: Station Superintendent, Karachi. - Bahrain. MSA.373/A.1238 22nd December, 1947. CONFIDENTIAL A ir S ervices in the Persian Gulf . * From a copy of the letter the Divisional Manager has written following his talk with you, I understand that you will shortly be contacting Sir Rupert Hay in order to obtain his views on the subject of Gulf Services. The Divisional Manager in his memorandum makes tlie following comment:- u The only way in which we could really secure a Share of local traffic would be to establish a local Company in Banrain to run essentially H Dhow Traffic 11 Services. I believe that this has been suggested before and it might well be worth while considering in more detail. It would have to be a special type of M third class 0 operation and would obviously have to keep .its fares at the lowest possible level. When I hear from the Station Superintendent, Bahrain, I think it would be worth while having a discussion in order to examine these possibilities of such an organisation.' As you are aware, now that steamer traffic has commenced the public have shown a disinclination to travel by air at the present rates, and when you write to the Divisional Manager you should certainly go into this aspect of the matter and indicate if lov/er fares are likely to re-influe nee this traffic on to the air route. If you are of the opinion that this might be so, then you should also indicate what you think the fares would have to be and give your reasons. 3. When considering the foregoing you should take into account that Iraqi Airways, and possibly Orient Airways, will be operating up the Gulf. If aircraft were based on Bahrain then it would appear that the main revenue might arise from the carriage of passengers to such places as Kuwait, Abadan, etc. and you should therefore review carefully the present traffic trend over these sectors and comment on the likely future growth in importance of these places and the resulting effect on the traffic potential. ‘ LB ’ (Sd).
