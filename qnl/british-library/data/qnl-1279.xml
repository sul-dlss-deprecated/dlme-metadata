Memorandum on the Turkish Claim to Sove reignty over the Eastern Shores of the Red Sea and the whole of Arabia; and on the Egyptian Claim to the whole of the Western Shore of the same Sea, including the African Coast from Suez to Cape Guardafui. Townhend's Dates. Beke's Pamphlet, p. 6. THERE are so many other circumstances con nected with the above claims on the part of Turkey ■and Egypt, (such, for instance, as the purchase by France of certain tracts of territory from native Chiefs; the conclusion of separate Treaties by England with Chiefs claiming independence; and the claim of Abyssinia to portions of the territory claimed by Egypt); that it has been thought that a consecutive history of the events which have taken place in that quarter of the globe during the last fifty years or so would be more likely to elucidate the general question than would be series of memoranda prepared upon each of these subjects separately. Before proceeding, however, to give such a narra tive, it is necessary to give a short statement of the events which have taken place in Egypt and Arabia from the time when portions of those countries came into the possession of the Turks.' In 1517 Sultan Selim I added Egypt to the Ottoman Empire. In the same century (Dr. Beke says 1558) the Turks, under Sultan Selim II, drove the Portuguese out of the Red Sea, and took possession of all its harbours and coasts in the name of the Sultan, in his character of Caliph, or Head of the Mahommedan Faith ; but the shallowness of this claim will here after be alluded to. [201] B2 Notwithstanding the claim thus put forward, the Plowden, July 9, 1854; No. 395. _ „ , • TIT 1 o 1- j CConfidential Papers, Abyssinia), Turks really only occupied Massowah, Suakin, and . n Easter: Zeyla, although they also built a fort at Dohono. Africa,' p. 69. It was at this time that the Abyssinians lost their Beke, p. 22. seaboard. In 1633 the power of Turkey became weakened, and the Turkish garrisons were withdrawn from the above places, and Zeyla then fell under the rule of the Imaum of Senna, in Arabia. In 1798 Egypt was invaded by the French under Napoleon Bonaparte; but in 1801 the French were expelled from Egypt by the ^English and Turkish troops. In 1806 Mehemet Ali was made Pasha of Egypt. The attention of the British Government was first drawn to the importance of the countries bordering on the Red Sea about the year 1810, when Lord Valentia visited the Indian Seas, and his secretary (Mr. Salt) was sent on a mission into Abyssinia. On the return of Mr. Salt he recommended the removal of obstructions which then interrupted the communications between Tigre and the Coast, so as to better free intercourse between Abyssinia and the British settlements in the East. This fact is here alluded to because nothing has been done in this respect, and the Abyssinians have still no sea port. On the 6th of February, 1827, Articles of Friend ship and Commerce were agreed upon between Captain Bremer of Her Majesty's ship 'Tamar ' Aitcheson's Treaties, vol. vii. and the Sheiks of the Somali tribe of Habr Owul State Papers, vol.lvi, P . 1391, at Berbereh, which were approved by the Bombay Government on the Lpth of May following. Sometime previously (in 1825), the British brig &lt;£ Marianne,' belonging to the Mauritius, had been plundered by the Somalis near Berbereh, and two Lascars belonging to her had been murdered, and Burton, vol. xxxiv, a British sloop-of-war had been sent to blockade the coast and to punish the natives. By this agreement the Chief of the Habr Owul tribe consented to pay 15,000 Spanish dollars for the plunder of the vessel and the cargo and to provide for the support of the families of the murdered seamen. Berbereh is one of the places which is now attracting considerable attention, owing to the Egyptian flag having been recently hoisted there, and a few remarks therefore upon the importance of the position will not be out of place.Berbereh is really a very important position, both in a political and commercial point of view. Burton, vol. xxxm. Captain Burton, who visited it in 1855, said it was Ibid., vol. xxxiv. the true key to the Red Sea, and that it was the only safe harbour for shipping between Suez and Cape Guardafui, and that in many respects it was a better position than Aden. He also stated that tradition asserted the post to have been occupied in turns by the Furs (old Per sians), the Arabs, the Turks, the Gallas, and the Somalis. He also drew attention to the fact that it had been coveted by many foreign conquerors, and Ibid., vols,xxxiii r xxxiv, pp. 408, 411. remarked that circumstances had then (in 1855, during the Crimean War), thrown it, as it were, into the arms of the English, and that if they refused the chance, another and a rival nation would not be so blind. The ' Aden Pilot ' says, the name of an Eng lishman is much respected by the natives, who make a marked difference between them and any Other nation. It then gives the following descrip tion of the place:— Berbereh, is the only harbour along the coast. It is 1J miles wide at the entrance, and free from all danger, having from 11 to 13 fathoms water at the mouth, and decreasing very gradually towards the shore, [t also affords good anchorage and complete shelter from all winds, except from the westward. ' The town of Berbereh is situated at the head of the harbour, and is a place of no mean importance Aden Pilot, p. 59, during the trading months, October to March, when the tribes from the interior assemble there and barter their goods with the Banyan merchants. ' A considerable export trade is carried on from the Pages 43 and 59. Soumali Coast, between Karram and Berbereh, to the opposite coast of Arabia, especially in sheep and gum. ' During the height of the fair (from October to March) Berbereh is stated to be a perfect Babel in confusion as in languages ; no Chief is acknowledged, Page 59. and the customs of bygone years are the laws of the place. When the fair is over, the place is entirely deserted.' Nothing is said by the authorities from which the &lt;'Aden Pilot' is compiled, about the Sublime Porte having ever exercised any authority over this territory. The fact of the British authorities at Aden having Or n . concluded a Treaty with the local Sheikh in 1827, nearly fifty years ago, shows that they then con sidered him independent, and Captain Burton states Page 408 that many years ago four martello towers which had been built there, were dismantled by orders from Aden, and that when he visited the place in 1855 they were in ruins. The particulars of this event do not exist in the archives of this office, but there would appear to be no reason to doubt the statement. Close to Berbereh is a place called Bulbar. It is of Burton, p. 401 2 little or no importance, but as the Egyptians lay claim to this place also, the following short account may be given of it:—When Captain Burton visited it in January 1855 he found it deserted; but he stated that it had at different times been a thriving place, as certain tribes visited it during the feuds which took place at Berbereh, but that the coast was open and havenless, and the Shimal wind raged there with resistless violence. The cause of its being deserted was this. During one of the family feuds among the Owal tribe at Berbereh, part of the | tribe quitted that place and settled at Bulbar, where, by their old connection with the Indian and other foreign traders, it succeeded in drawing off a con siderable amount of traffic ; but the roadstead being insecure, many vessels were lost, and ultimately, in # 1847, the Ee^a Somals fell upon the new-comers, and slaughtered their women and children. Leaving here for a time the question of the western Burton, vol. xii. shores of the Red Sea, it is important to record what was going on about this time on the eastern coast. A report was generally circulated and believed that the Pasha of Egypt's troops in the Hedjaz, or northern province of Arabia, had received orders to take possession of Mocha and the other seaports of the Yemen, as .well as the fortress of Aden. The British Consul at Alexandria was appealed to .to use his influence with the Pasha, in order that the 4 Banians might be well treated in case such an event should take place. The Pasha, however, on being asked for an explanation of his intentions, ' explicitly disclaimed all intentions of taking j un e is, 1825. possession of any of the ports of the Imaum {of Senna) or of Aden.' He admitted confidentially that the Porte had often urged him to take these ports, but declared that he was unwillino; to(D take any step which might be likely to embroil him with the Indian Government. Mehemet Ali, Pasha of Egypt, was then sub servient to the Sultan. It has been said that about the year 1830 a Firman was issued by the Sultan, authorizing the Pasha of Egypt to take possession of the Yemen, but whether this were so or not is of little moment since he had not actually possessed the whole country for two centuries. In 1831 Mehemet Ali revolted against the Sultan's authority, and invaded Syria. In 1832 the Egyptian troops at Jeddah revolted, and quitting that place, went to Mocha, which then belonged to the Imaum of Senna and took possession of the town and neighbourhood. In 1833 an expedition was sent by the Pasha against the rebels near Mocha. Captain Mackenzie, July 4, 1837. In 1835 the Egyptian army, under Ibrahim Pasha, a nephew of Mehemet Ali, occupied Mocha, and 'most of the seaport towns,' although frequently opposed by local tribes, but the army itself was defeated by the Bedouin Arabs of Asseer, which so vexed Mehemet Ali that he made extensive pre parations for another campaign against this tribe in the following year, which, however, was equally unsuccessful. Aden was then governed by a marauding Sheikh, and the intentions of Mehemet Ali were stated to be as follows:—To march a detachment of troops from Mocha to take possession of Aden, with its excellent harbour, commanding the passage into the Red Sea, as soon as he had put down the Asseers ; then to push on to Hadramaut (which was parcelled out among petty Princes and Sheikhs); thence to Oman, and eventually to Muscat and the country on the south-west side of the Persian Gulf, thus rendering himself master of the whole peninsula of Arabia, after obtaining which the conquest of Baghdad would be an easy task. He had heard, it was said, of the power and grandeur of this ancient Caliphat, and longed to found an Empire which should rival, if not surpass it, in splendour. On hearing of these rumours of Egyptian designs on Aden, Muscat, and Bagdad, as well as on the shores on the entrance to the Red Sea and outside No. 15, August 4, 1837. the Straits of Babelmandeb, Colonel Campbell was instructed by Lord Palmerston to intimate to the [201] C ,Pasha that such movements of his forces or th6 execution of such intentions would not be well looked upon in England or in India, and might give rise to discussions between him and the British Government. The Pasha, however, declared that he had never contemplated such an expedition, in the following note, addressed by Boghos JoussoufF to Colonel Campbell :— 'Le Soussigrne est de plus autorisd a prier M. le Colonel Campbell, No. 51 July 23 1837 Colonel Campbell de vouloir bien transmettre ^ son u ^ ' Excellence le Vicomte Palmerston Passurance posi tive que Son Altesse le Vice-Roi n'a jamais perdui de vue les interets de la Grande Bretagne pour prendre des mesures ou former des voeux qui puissent les contrarier moindrement; la supposition de 1'occupation des terres susmentionnees, denuee de tout fondernent, ne peut etre qu'un trait lance par la malveillance.' It may here be mentioned, in passing, that, in 1837, the Governor of Bombay applied to Mehemet Ali for permission to establish in the Island of Kumaran, 'which it was understood Providence had happily Colonel Campbell, No. 9, 3 February *23, 1837. placed under His Highness' beneficent Govern- To Colonel Campbell, No ment,' a dep6t of coals for the use of the British A P nl 3 ' 1837 ' steamers frequenting the Red Sea, which was readily granted; and the Egyptian right to this island was thereby fully acknowledged. Early in this year (1837) Captain James Mackenzie, From Captain Mackenzie of the Bengal Light Cavalry, travelled through 1837 ' Arabia and Egypt, and on his return he drew up a report, a copy of which he transmitted to this.; Office, accompanied by a map, showing the conquests of Mehemet Ali, Pasha of Egypt, on the shores of the Red Sea, both in the Hedjaz, the Yemen, and Senna, on the Arabian Coast, and in Egypt and Nubia, on the African coast. This map is annexed. Map. In this report, he stated that the only places along the western coast of the Red Sea, then occupied by the Egyptians, were Kosseir and Suakin j but that Mehemet Ali had conquered, and that his troops were in actual possession of, the whole line of the Arabian coast from Suez and Akaba, in the north, to Mocha, near the Straits of Babelmandeb, at the southern extremity of the Red Sea; that, with the exception of Mecca and the fertile district of Taik, to the east of Jeddah, Inis dominions did not extend into the interior above a mile or two from this? ■ f 7 sea-shore; but that Mehemet Ali's troops garrisoned the chief towns and ports on the eastern edge of the Red Sea. ' The following towns were marked on the map as being garrisoned by Turkish troops :—Suez, Moilah, Wedge Fort, Yenbo, Medina, Jeddah, Mecca, Gon- foda, Gheezan, Loheia, Hodeida, and Mocha. The possession of these places. Captain Mackenzie remarked, gave to the Pasha the command of the whole commerce of the Hedjaz and the Yemen, and he stated that he never saw more liberal or better managed Custom-houses than those of the Pasha at Jeddah and Mocha, and he added that the English were treated with the greatest civility and attention, which he attributed to the presence in the Red Sea of two British ships of war of the Indian navy. Up to this time Mehemet Ali had not succeeded in taking possession of the fertile Province of Senna, having been repeatedly defeated by the Bedouin tribes of Asseer. In this same year (1837) a British ship was wrecked, and plundered by the people of Aden, and the Government of Bombay first asked permission from the Home Government to call upon the Sultan of Lahej for satisfaction for this outrage, and sub sequently it asked to be allowed to take possession of the port of Aden as a compensation for the insults which had been offered by its Ruler to tTie British flag. Negotiations ensued between the authorities of Bombay and the Sultan, and even tually (on the 23rd January, 1838) the town and promontory of Aden were ceded to Great Britain by the Sultan of Lahej for the annual payment of Hertslet's Treaties, vol. ii, pp. 1, 2. 8,700 dollars. The transfer of the place was duly notified by letter to Ibrahim Pasha, the younger, who, in reply, stated that he considered it a de pendency of the Hedjaz ; Boghos Bey, the Egyptian Minister for Foreign Affairs, however, informed the British Consul at Alexandria that he was of opinion that Aden was under the rule of the Imaum of Senna, but that, nevertheless, if it could be proved that it was not so dependent, the Pasha of Egypt would do all in his power to confirm the cession. Subsequently, the Sultan of Lahej having given proof of bad faith, and having avoided acting up to his engagement, Aden was taken and occupied by British forces.

But Lord Ponsonby, then Her Majesty's Ambas- No. 149, June 16, 1838. sador at Constantinople, pointed out that it was the Sultan to whom the British Government was accountable for having taken Aden, and not the Pasha of Egypt, who was not an independent Sovereign. [For a full report on the claim of the Sultan to sovereignty over the Yemen, and on other points connected with that question, see the late Mr. Spring Rice's Memorandum of 1st November, Memorandum, 1st November, 1843. 1843, annexed.] The Egyptian forces had now been for a long time on the Arabian Coast, and as they continued their operations against the several tribes of the Yemen, Colonel Campbell, Her Majesty's Consul- No. 17, August 24, 1838.

The following is a list of those concluded 1839 :— in Hazzabees January 31, 1839 Hertslet, vol. viii, p. Abdalees February 2, 1839 Ibid., vol. viii, p. 2.

June 18, 1839 Ibid., p. 7.9 In May of that year the Pasha of Egypt was told that the British Government could not view with indifference any attack on the independence of the native Chiefs in the vicinity of Aden; and Lord Palmerston informed the India Board that he saw no reason why the East India Company's Agent at Aden should not concluded Treaties of Friendship and Commerce with the Chiefs whose independence was threatened by Mehemet Ali, or why the Indian Government should not afford those Chiefs any assistance, he might think proper to help them to defend themselves. Senna was at this time (1840) evidently considered by the Pasha of Egypt to be independent, as His Highness sent an Ambassador to the Imaum of Senna with an offer to assist him with men, money, and supplies if he would endeavour to drive the English out of Aden, and promising in return that, on the expiration of the war, he would yield the conquered country to the Imaum. Another proposition was also made by the same Ambassador, that ' the Imaum should make over his Sovereignty of Senna to Mehemet Ali, who, in return, would grant him a suitable pension for life,'' thereby clearly admitting his independence. We must now turn back again to Egypt. The French being already active in the Levant began now to make their appearance in the Red Sea. It was generally believed that their real aim was to gain a footing in Abyssinia; and as French ships were sent to visit the coast, a British ship of war was sent from Aden to watch their movements. It was found that they had first endeavoured to purchase a place in Assab Bay, but had failed ; that they -had thereupon tried, first, by fair means, to obtain possession of a place called Heyb (qy. Edd), but that on the Chief expressing a wish to consult the British Agent at Aden (Captain Haines) before entering into any bond, they had threatened to use an armed force to compel the Chief to comply with their wishes. In August of this year. Captain Moresby, of the Indian Navy, received orders from the East India Company to proceed to Tadjoura, and on the 19th of the same month he concluded a Treaty of Peace, Commerce, &amp;c., on the part of the East India Com- [201] D10 pany with Sultan Mahomed bin Mohummed of Tadjoura, by which it was agreed, among other things, that the Sultan of Tadjoura would endeavour to do all in his power to introduce produce into the interior States of Eiffat, Shoa, and Abyssinia, and that, in return, the authorities at Aden would endeavour to encourage interior export trade through Tadjoura. The Sultan of Tadjoura also promised not to enter into any Treaty with any European or other Power, political or commercial, which might be detrimental or injurious to British interests, with out first bringing it to the notice of the British authorities at Aden ; and, in return, the East India Company promised ' that they would act in no manner which might have an evil tendency towards the States of Tadjoura.' At the time of the conclusion of this Treaty a Deed of Sale of the Island of Mussa (or Mushahh) was granted by the Sultan of Tadjoura to the British Government for ten bags of rice. As these islands (Mussa and another one Aybat) are those which the Egyptian Government are anxious that the British Government should vacate in their favour, it may be useful to give an account of the circumstances under which they came into the possession of the English, as well as a short account of Tadjoura and Zeyla, whose Chiefs con cluded the Treaty with Captain Moresby for the cession of the islands. In July 1840 the political Agent at Aden received orders from the East India Company in London to send a ship of war to the Bay of Tadjoura; Captain Moresby was the officer selected and the result of his mission, on which he was accompanied by Sheikh Shumarkee, Sheikh of Berbereh,- and Hadjee Abdool Russool British Agent at Mocha, is thus given by him in his official Report:— ' Forty-eight hours after our arrival at Tadjoura, I came to a speedy settlement on board the f Sesostris/ with the Sultan of that place. Chief of the Donkalee tribes, by entering into a Treaty with him, and purchasing an island or islands (for they are two joined together), called Massarah, for which I gave him 1,100 German crowns, and thirty-two bags of rice, besides other presents of small value. The sale of the island is not mentioned in the Treaty, but drawn11 out separately, according to Mahomedan form, say ing that the island has been sold by the Sultan, and his heirs, to the British Government, for ten bags of rice. ' The Treaty did not require altering from the form you kindly sent me. All the principal men have signed it; and I must not omit to mention, and bring to the notice of Government the great assistance Sheik Shermarkee, Chief of the Soomau- lee tribe at Berbereh, has rendered our Government at this time. This Chief is a true and staunch friend of the English, and carries weight and respect among all the natives, more particularly the Soomau- lees. To this man are we mainly indebted for a speedy arrangement of the mattersj the hand some manner he evinced when 1 called upon him to assist us on this mission, which involved the risk of his house, property, wives, and family, left behind at Mocha, proves that he is more than a common friend to us; and I hope Government will notice iit to him in some manner, as on a former occa sion during the Government of the Honourable Mr. Elphinstone. Prior to receiving Shermarkee on board at Mocha, he requested, by letter, British protection against all insults and losses which he might incur during his absence, or return to Mocha. This I at once promised, as he also came when he was just about dispatching to Bombay two of his large trading-boats, which convey yearly about 300 tons of coffee and other goods. ' Hadee Abdool Russool, the British Agent, also made the same request as to British protection, which I granted; but I am sorry to say, on our return to Mocha, he found it unsafe to return to his family and house, in which he had much property. Sheik Shermarkee landed on our return, was called before the Governor, and taxed as to where he had been, and what doing. The G overnor of Mocha, Sheriff Houssein, offered him no violence; but it appeared that, after we had left Mocha with the Agent, and Shermarkee on board, he had ordered his guards to be imprisoned, for not informing him of their departure; and issued an order for none of the merchants, or captains of the native boats and vessels to leave Mocha without his permission. He also prevented four boxes being shipped belonging12 to the British Agent, from which, after opening they (the authorities at Mocha), took out two musical boxes, and then allowed them to pass. I have, therefore, brought the British Agent on with me to Aden. Sheik Shermarkee is also in fear that he will be molested after our departure. Should that be the case / he will inform you at Aden. 'Captain Moresby bad been told to conclude, if possible, a Treaty with Zeyla ; but, in his Report, he said, ' Respecting the Treaty with the Chief of Zeyla, I find it would just now be useless to attempt anything. It appears Zeyla is entirely dependent &amp;n Mocha, from which place a Governor and an armed force are sent for the protection of the place, for which the inhabitants pay yearly 500 dollars. Now there are no independent Chiefs at Zeyla or about it, wandering tribes surrounding the place, which, like Tadjoura, is a market for slaves. 'Sheik Shermarkee proposes that, after ten or fifteen days, when he has dispatched his boats to Aden, and the whole business of his tribes settled at Mocha, that he will come to Mocha, when he will be happy to render us further service. The moving tribes about that time commence to congregate at Berbereh, Zeyla, and Tadjoura for their annual fair of commerce; with these tribes Sheik Shermarkee has great influence, and hopes, with them and the inhabitants at Zeyla, to induce them, in defiance of the Mocha authorities, to conclude a similar Treaty to Tadjoura, which, being already concluded, will have much weig-ht. 'Respecting Berbereh, over which Sheik Sher markee has full authority, he says we have only to point out what ground we want and it will be granted, to build forts, houses, or anything else, and that he and his tribes are ready to conclude Treaties of Commerce, which he assures me will be lasting so long as he and his successors live.' Captain Moresby then gives some very useful in formation about the neighbourhood of Tadjoura and Zeila, which is too lengthy to be repeated here, but there are one or two facts which he states which are worth recording: for instance, he says, the territory of the Tadjoura Sultan to the west-south-west extends about fifteen miles inland to the salt lake Assal; that inland their territory extends two days'13 India Board, October 7, 1843, November 15, 1843. journey to the east and north, and that round the coast inside the Red Sea the Tadjoura territories extend to Assab Bay. He also says, the Sultan of Tadjoura pays annually from 1,200 to 1,300 German crowns, called head money, to the inhabitants of Zeyla; and that when he mentioned to the Sultan and head men that this showed they were tributary to Zeyla, they said ' no, it was a very old standing custom, and that they were perfectly independent of Zeyla;' he further states that one of the natives, a man of some con sequence, who resided one day's journey inland from Tadjoura, assured him that, in his country, coal was to be found in abundance, and that he had shown a specimen of it to a French gentleman, who told him on no account to show it to the English. Lieutenant Barker, who visited Tadjoura at the same time in the 'Euphrates,' said in his Report (which also contained much useful information)— ' The dignity of Sultan of the Danakil tribes does not, as in other countries, descend from father to son, but from Sultan to Vizier, who, as he has assisted to conduct all the affairs of the State during the life time of the Sultan, is considered the most competent to fill the vacancy on his death.' He added— 'We were given to understand that, though Tadjoura was an independent State, still that it paid a head tax upon all slaves sold to the Sultan of Zeyla; that, in other respects, Tadjoura was tribu tary to no one ; that the tax which was levied by the Sultan of Zeyla appeared to be a. remnant of an old custom when Zeyla was the principal city on the coast, and received regular tribute from all the other • States.' Moreover, he stated that— ' Whatever Power held Mocha must have great influence with all the States from Suakin to Berbereh; that the Sheikh of Zeyla was appointed 4 by the Dole of Mocha, who sent about fifty men with him to see that no measures were carried into effect that might injure his interests in that quarter.' And here it may be mentioned that when Ibrahim Pasha withdrew his troops from the Yemen, he gave the ' seaports of the 'i emen and the Tehama' to the Sheriff of Mocha (one Sheriff [201] ' EHussain), in consideration of his paying Mehemed Ali Pasha 90,000 German crowns annually. This man was bigoted, proud, and, unlike the agents of Mehemet Ali, in every way hostile to the English. He increased the duties of Mocha by 7 per cent; insulted British subjects ; refused supplies being sent to Aden ; and eventually went so far as to cut down the British Consular flag. A complaint was made by the British Government india Board, October 7, 184S to the Porte against this man, and a Commission was sent to inquire into his behaviour. The extension of Turkish power and influence so far east as the Yemen by this transfer of Mocha, and the sea pqrts to Sheriff Hussain, was considered as a question of great political importance, involving, as it did, or was likely to do, both injury to Aden and to the British Indian trade with the Red Sea; and Lieutenant Barker reported that any attempt to conclude a Treaty with Zeyla would be futile so long as Sheriff Hussain held the reins of govern ment at Mocha. On receipt of Captain Moresby's Report, the Governor of Aden directed the Islands of Mussa to be formally taken possession of by hoisting the British flag. He also gave directions for the small island at the entrance of Gubut Kharab to be purchased in case any fine anchorage existed within the Bay. He also suggested to the India Board that, with a view to counteract French intrigues with the Sheriff of Mocha, advantage would accrue to British interests by placing Mocha in the hands of its hereditary and rightful Sovereign the Imaum of Senna, who was then collecting a force to regain it, if possible. It was also considered of the greatest importance that an attempt should be made to conclude a Treaty of Commerce with the Chief of Zeyla, as a French Expedition was expected to arrive very shortly in # these waters. The Zeyla people were very friendly disposed towards the English, but not so towards the French. Captain Moresby was, therefore, directed to pro ceed to Mocha with a view—first, of conciliating the Sheriff Houssain, and then of concluding the Treaty with Zeyla. Captain Moresby soon succeeded in conciliating15 Geographical Society's Journal, vol. xviii, p. 130. i( Aden Pilot,' p. 63. the Sheriff of Mocha, with whom he concluded a Commercial Treaty ; and he then proceeded to enter into negotiations for a Treaty with the proprietor and head of the Arab tribes inhabiting Zeyla, Seid Mahomed Bar, Commander-in-chief of the Sheriff's army at Mocha, whose family had for years possessed Zeyla under the Government of Mocha, to whom he paid a yearly sum. This Treaty was concluded on the 3rd September, but the Chief of Zeyla wished it not to be known that he had entered into such a Treaty until the absence of Sheriff Hussain. This Treaty contained a stipulation similar to that contained in the Treaty with Tadjoura, namely, that no Treaty should be concluded by the Government of Zeyla without the previous knowledge of the Government of Aden, whilst the British authorities in return promised to do all in their power to assist the Government of Zeyla in improving his com mercial resources. By Article V of this Treaty, the Government of Zeyla made over to the English Government the Tlsland of Aubad, or Aybat, as a harbour for their ships and vessels, without any prohibition whatever. But the island itself, and another one close adjoin ing called Saad el Din, or Sadaldin, was visited by Captain Burton in 1855, and he described them as two small patches of seagirt sand. He found no one resident upon either of them, and he stated that they appeared to be simply a resort for sea-gulls, and that they 'supplied Zeyla in the season with thousands of gulls' eggs—a great luxury.' Captain Playfair observes, in his ' History of ^ Arabia Felix or Yemen,' page 165, that It should not be forgotten that, while these events occurred, the whole Province of Yemen, to which this portion of the coast of Africa had formerly been, and had since become a dependency, was in a state of anarchy ; that it had been evacuated by the Egyptians ; that the Imaum of Senna had lost the Tehama, which was usurped by the Beni Aseer and the Sheriffs of Aboo-Areesh, while they had not extended their arms to Africa; and that the Governments of Zailah and Tadjoura were in the hands of their hereditary Chiefs, who owned no subjection to any Foreign Power, and consequently were perfectly competent to cede any part of their territories.'16 Zeyla has more than once been occupied by the Turks, and Captain Burton gives the following account of the original occupation of the town by them about the year 1500:— 'When the Turks conquered Yemen (about Burton, page 68= 1500) the lawless janissaries 'who lived upon the very bowels of commerce' drove the peaceable Arab merchants to the opposite shore. The trade of India, flying from the same enemy, took refuge in Adel, amongst its partners (Adel, Arabia, and India being then, according to Bruce, partners in one trade, who eventually exported their produce to Europe, Asia, and Africa, at that time the whole known world). ' The Turks of Arabia, though they were blind to the cause, were sensible of the great influx of wealth into the opposite kingdom. They took possession, therefore, of Zeyla, which they made a den of thieves ; established there what they called a Custom house ; and by means of that port, and galleys cruizing in the narrow Straits of Babelmandeb, they laid the Indian trade to Adel under heavy contri bution, that might indemnify them for the great desertion their violence and injustice had occasioned in Arabia.' Captain Burton then alludes to the occupation of other parts of the coasts of the Red Sea by the Turks. He says :— ' The Turks, under a show of protecting Ibid., page €9, note, commerce, established three ports in three different parts ; but they soon made it appear that the end proposed was only to ascertain who were the subjects from whom they could levy the most enormous extortions. Jeddah, Zebid, and Mocha, the places of consequence nearest to Abyssinia on the Indian coast j Suakin, a seaport town on the very barrier of Abyssinia, in the immediate way of the caravans to Cairo, on the African side, were each under the command of a Turkish Pasha, and garrisoned by Turkish troops sent thither from* Constantinople by the Emperors Selim and Sulayman. 5 ' At the time when Captain Burton visited Zeyla— in 1854—Hajj Sharmarkaj was Governor of the place, and he gave Captain Burton a Table showing Ibid., page is. that he was the sixteenth in descent from the founder of the Gerhajis and Awul tribes. Sharmarkay succeeded, about the year 1841, as Ibid., page 19.17 Governor of Zeyla and its dependencies, under the Burton, p. 20. Ottoman Pasha of Western Arabia; but, in July 1855, he was deposed by the Turkish Pasha of Hodeida. In 1841 the dispute between Turkey and Egypt was brought to a satisfactory termination. Zeyla has no harbour. A vessel of 250 tons cannot approach within a mile of the landing-place ; Ibid., pp. 15 and 21. ^ ^nd no craft larger than a canoe can ride near the town. Nevertheless, it commands the adjacent harbour of Tadjoura, and is by position the northern port of Aussa, of Haran, and of southern Abyssinia, Ibid., p, 23. although the feuds of the rulers have transferred the main trade to Berbereh. It is said that some twenty years or so ago the French Agent at Jeddah purchased, from the son of the Governor of Zeyla, during his father's absence, Ibid., p. 20. a large store house in Berbereh, but on the return of the Governor he caused the bargain to be broken off, knowing, as Captain Burton said, ' how easily an agency could become a fort.' The reference made to the dependency of Ze^a on Mocha renders it necessary to revert to the ques tion of the Turkish claim to sovereignty over the Yemen, in which province Mocha is situated, and here it may at once be stated that such a claim has never been recognized by the British Government; Page 18 of printed Memorandum on on the contrary, it is well known that the interior of the Yemen. . , . . , . . . , the country is in the possession of various inde pendent chiefs, and Lord Palmerston stated in 1839 India Office, September 4, 1 839. that Mehemet Ali had no right whatever over the \ J[nclosure ? J« n e 9. countries possessed by these rulers. But in 1843 the question was fully gone into. It arose out of the following circumstance :— Hertslet's Treaties, vol. y, p. 506. On the 16th August, 1838, a Convention of Commerce and ISTavigation was concluded between Great Britain and Turkey; and it was stated in Article VI that it was agreed by the Turkish Government that the regulations established therein should be general throughout the Turkish Empire, whether in Turkey in Europe or Turkey in Asia, in Egypt, or other African Possessions belonging to the Sublime Porte, &amp;c.; and a question arose in 1843. Sir S. Canning, No. 162; whether British merchants at Jeddah were warranted in refusing to pay the 12 per cent, duty on mer chandize imported into Jeddah from the Yemen, Abyssinia, and other adjacent countries over which the Sultan asserted a right of sovereignty. [201] F August 1, 1843.18 The Pasha of Jeddah complained to the Porte of the refusal of the British merchants to pay the duty, and the Porte demanded the payment of it under the provisions of the Commercial Treaty of 1838 ; but it was believed that the Porte, in insisting on - the payment of the duty, had in view the British establishment at Aden. As Abyssinia was introduced into the discussion, Sir S. Canning, then Ambassador at Constanti nople, stated that he was informed that no part of Abyssinia was actually administered, or in any way controlled, by the Turkish authorities. He said it was true that the name of the country figured in the list of the Sultan's titles, but he observed that in the same list were also to be found the names of Circassia, Algiers, Georgia, and, he believed, Persia; and here it may be remarked that Consul Finn, in a despatch from Jerusalem, dated No. 751. 5th May, 1862, said that the Sultan claimed to be King of India, and that, so far from his ever Ifaving recognized his loss of Algiers, that ' all Algerines visiting Jerusalem acknowledged them selves to be Turkish subjects—no doubt in the sense of recognizing the Sultan's title as Caliphah or head of the Mahommedan religion.^ But Sir S. Canning observed that, so far as Abyssinia was concerned, a considerable portion of the Abyssinian population was Christian, and that in those districts where Christianity prevailed, the Sultan could not pretend even to the spiritual authority of the Caliphat. In order, however, to show the utter impossibility of enforcing such a claim, it may be as well to insert here a complete list of the Sultan's titles. They are as follows :— ' Titres du Sultan. ' Moi qui, par la grace speciale et la bont^ infinie du Tres-Haut, et par les miracles eminens des Prophetes, je suis le Sultan des Sultans, le Khakan des Khakans,| le distributeur des Couronnes, I'ombre de Dieu sur la terre, le serviteur des plus nobles parmi les villes et les habitations, la venerable Mecque et la resplendissante Medine, qui sont Jes Kibles des Musulmans et I'autel vers lequel tons les fideles se retournent; le protecteur et le * Seep. 51. f Ancien titre des Souverains Tartares.19 * Gouverneur de la Sainte Jerusalem ; I'Empereur des trois grandes villes de Constantinople, d'Andri- nople et de Brousse; le Souverain de Damas, de Tripoli de Syrie, de Caire, de toute VArable, de VAfrique, de Barca, de ICirvan, d'Alep, de I'lrak-el- Areb, de I'lrak-el-Adjem, de Bassora, de Sahsa, de Deilem, de Bagdad, de Raclea, de Moussoul, de Schehrzor, de Diarbekir, de Zulcadriye, d'Erzeroum, de Sivas, d'Adana, de la Caramanie, de Kars, de Djilder, de Van, de la Moree, de la Barbarie, de VAhyssinie, d'Alger, de Tripoli, de Barbarie, de Tunis, de la Mer Noire et de la Mer Blanche, avec les lies et les Cotes, de I'Anatolie, de la Roumelie, du Kurdistan, des Grec^ et des Turcs, de la Tartarie, de la Circassie, de la Georgie, de la Tartarie Precopieune, de toutes les villes situees dans les environs de la Tartarie, de Caffa, de la Bosnie, de Belgrade, de la Servie, ainsi que des villes et forteresses qui s'y trouvent, de la Valachie, * See separate Memorandun) on a i ns i q U e de la Moldavie et des forteresses avoisin- Turkish claim to sovereignty over • g • i -n ^ ^ * c the Island of Bahrein in the Persian antes j ennn d une inhmt de viiles et torteresses, &amp;c. Gulf - With regard to the Viceroys claim to sovereignty on the Arabian side of the Red Sea, Sir S. Canning said that such claim was disputed, and in some instances successfully resisted, by more than one of the local Chiefs; and he asked Lord Aberdeen whether, in replying to the Porte (with regard to the payment of the 12 per cent, duty at Jeddah and elsewhere), he was to be guided by the principle of a de jure or of that of a de facto sovereignty; whether, if acting upon the former principle, he was to con sider the whole of Abyssinia and of Arabia as part of the Turkish Empire; and on what grounds he was to maintain the right of Great Britain, or of the East India Company, should that right be specifically questioned, to the possession of Aden, which was then rapidly becoming an important commercial depot ? India Office, October 7, 1843. The question was represented first to the India Queen's Advocate, May 15, 1844. Board, and subsequently to the Queens Advocate (Sir J. Dbdson), and on receipt of their replies. Sir Stratford Canning was told that, with the exception of Mocha, the countries claimed by the Porte in Africa and Arabia could not be considered part of the Ottoman Dominions, and that, consequently, the productions of those countries passing through any part of the Turkish territories must be treated20 ft for fiscal purposes on precisely the same footing as the productions of any other foreign country whatever. The India Board in their reply made the following observations ;—' It was thought by them that the British Govern ment could scarcely contest the right of sovereignty of the Sultan over the district of the Yemen, at the time when they were calling on the Sultan for redress for the misconduct of the authorities at Mocha, but still they observed that the application to the Sultan for redress for the misconduct of an officer who acknowledged his allegiance to the Sultan, did not imply on the part of the British Government the recognition of the Sultan's authority over any other portion of the Yemen than that under the actual authority of the Sheriff of Mocha. Their letter then proceeded as follows :— 'The Sultan's sovereignty, though not uninter rupted and undisputed throughout the whole of the Hedjaz, has existed for centuries, nominally over the whole, and actually over the principal portion, of it, especially over Medina and Mecca, and their ports Yambo and Djedda, but with the Yemen the case is very different. The independence of that division of Arabia was interrupted for a time by Ottoman conquest, but was never de jure surren dered, and for the greater portion of the time during which the Turks have had command in the Yemen, it has only been so far as they have com manded by military garrisons some of the principal cities in their immediate vicinities. 'In the Carte Gene'rale de I'Empire Ottomane,' which bears date 1843, and accompanies the French edition of M. de Hammer's ' Histoire de I'Empire Ottomane,' the whole of the Yemen is included among the countries which were formerly a part of the Ottoman Empire, and have been successively detached from it by conquest or by Treaty. ' We do not think it necessary to the present question to consider that of the British title to Aden, in so far as it results from the cession by the Sultan or Faki of Aden. Whether the ruler of Aden made, in so far as depended on himself, a valid cession of the territory; whether he could make such cession without the consent of his tribe; and whether he was independent of the Imaum of Senna,21 are points in no way essential to tbe present question, which is solely between the British Government and the Ottoman Porte. 'The occupation of a portion of the Yemen by the troops of the Pasha of Egypt, in 1833, was treated by the British Government as an occupation only; and, in 1838, though the Pasha at first put forward a claim to have Aden treated as a depen dency on the Yemen, he finally consented that Aden should be regarded as a British possession, and that the whole of the territory under the rule of the Sultan or Governor of Aden should be con sidered as British territory, and respected as such. ' This admission on the part of Mehemet Ali may not be considered by the Sultan as binding on the Ottoman Porte, nevertheless, it would still remain for the Porte to prove that it ever possessed a sovereignty de jure over the Yemen, or that it ever possessed a sovereignty de facto, excepting so far as its military force could reach, and so long as that force was successfully exercised. Even thus, the Turks did not hold Aden much more than sixty years,'* and it is now more than two centuries since they were finally expelled by the Seyds, who main tained their independence till the time of the British possession. ' It is clear that the Ottoman Porte has no sovereignty in Abyssinia. In the ' Carte Generale' above referred to, Abyssinia is excluded from all the boundaries, past and present, of the Ottoman Empire. ' It follows, we think, clearly from these pre mises that, with reference to the present specific question of duties at Djedda, Mocha should be regarded as a Turkish possession, Aden as a British possession, and all the rest of the Yemen, and all Abyssinia, as independent of both.' And as a proof of the recognition of such inde pendence, it may be stated that, in addition to the Treaties concluded by the British authorities at Aden with the independent Chiefs above alluded to, further Treaties were concluded with the Sultan of Lahej on the 11th June, 1843, 20th February, 1844, and 7th May, 1849. The following is a full extract from the Queen's Advocate's report on the subject:— ♦ 1569 to 1630. [201] o22 i 'The validity of the claim put forward by the Queen 's Advocate, May 15, 1844. Sublime Porte, respecting the amount of duties payable by British subjects under the Convention of 1838, appears to depend upon the national character to be ascribed to the several countries and places adverted to in the letter of Sir Stratford Canning and in the memorandum transmitted by his Excel lency from Rifaat Pasha, bearing date the 26th of July, 1843. 'The countries and places referred to in those documents are the Yemen generally and the towns of Mocha and Aden in particular, and also Abyssinia. 'In respect of this last mentioned country it appears to me that the question may at once be satis factorily disposed of. No authority of any kind r either as to the appointment of Governors or other wise, is, or has, for a very long time past, been exercised by the Turkish Government; and, it is therefore, quite evident that, for commercial pur poses at least, Abyssinia cannot be considered as now forming a part of the Turkish Empire. The mere circumstance of its being comprehended among; the titles of the Sultan is a matter of very slight importance. 'With respect to the Yemen generally, it is to be observed that there can be no doubt that it did, at one time, belong both de jure and de facto to the Turkish Empire ; but it appears upon the authority cited in the Memorandum, with which I have by your Lordship's directions been favoured (Hammer, tome ix, page 28(3), that in the year 1663, in the reign of Murad the Fourth, the Ottoman army was defeated, and that the dominion of the Yemen then passed to the Seids, since which time, with the exception of temporary military occupations of some portions of it, it had been governed by the Imaum of Sennar (the Chief of the Seids), who is described as in all respects independent, acknowledging no superior, temporal or spiritual. There can, there fore, in my opinion, be no just pretence for ascribing to the Yemen a'Turkish character. 'As regards Mocha, which is situated in the Yemen, it appears, according to the same Memoran^ dum, to have been seized by Toorche Bilmar, from whom it was afterwards, viz., in December 1833^ taken by the Bedouins, at the instigation of the23 Pasha of Egypt, and subsequently delivered into the hands of Ibraham Pasha, by whom it was held until the evacuation of the Yemen by the troops of Mehemet Ali, in 1840. Sheriff Houssein was then appointed to rule over it, on condition of paying tribute to the Pasha, which tribute, it is stated, has been regularly paid. It must therefore be admitted that the Turkish Government possesses de fctoto some authority over Mocha and its Sheriff, and this authority would seem to have been acknowledged and recognized by the appeal which Sir Stratford Canning was directed to make to the Porte for redress against the conduct of the Sheriff, and by the fact of a Commissioner having in consequence been dispatched to Mocha by the Turkish Government. ' So far therefore as relates to Mocha, I am not prepared to say that Her Majesty's Government is in a situation to deny the right of the Sultan's claim to have that place considered as part of his dominions. 'As respects Aden, I do not find that any autho rity has been there exercised, either directly or indirectly by the Sultan since 1663, when it passed with the rest of the Yemen under the dominion of the Seids. Aden therefore cannot now be justly con sidered as being under the sovereignty of the Sultan. 'It maybe proper to observe in regard to the portion of the coast of the Yemen, reported to have been recently acquired by the Sheriff of Mocha, that such acquisition cannot be deemed valid, inasmuch as the Porte possessed no authority whatever over the territory in question, and, conse quently, was incapable of making the grant. u In conclusion, it appears to me, that no part of the Yemen, with the exception of Mocha, is rightly to be considered as coming within the Provisions af the Convention of 1838.' In 1847 Turkish troops were again sent to the coast of Arabia with orders to garrison Jeddah, Mecca, and Medina. It was rumoured that the Porte intended to send a small body of regular troops to the Hedjaz, and to give up the annual tribute of 60,000 luses (300,000/.) provided Mehe met Ali would send an Egyptian army into Arabia to protect the Hedjaz from the incursions of the mountain tribes; and Mr. Murray was instructed to point out to the Porte that it would make a24 very bad bargain if it gave up the Egyptian tribute in order to enable Mehemet Ali to conquer and retain, as he assuredly would do, the Provinces of Arabia. ^ It was, however, generallv believed that such an ^ os ' 2 and 7 &gt; of January 1 T • , ' , ^ . and 17, 1847. expedition as the bultan proposed would be annihi lated, and it was therefore abandoned. In May 1848, it having been reported that the India Office, June 27, 1848. Yemen had submitted to the Porte, and that Emir Houssain had been raised to the rank of Pasha, the Political Agent of the East India Company at Aden addressed a letter to the Government of Bombay in which he gave the following particulars respecting Sheriff Houssain:— ' In 1836 Sheriff Houssain was a Kalil, or Secre tary to Mahomed Ameen Bey, then Governor of Mocha under Mehemet Ali Pasha. On the evacu ation of the Yemen by the Egyptian troops, in accordance, I believe, with the Treaty of the five Powers of Europe, attempts were made by Mehemet Ali's Government to dispose of the seaport towns to the highest bidder. The Imaum of Senna was too poor to come forward, and the struggle rested between Ali Homeida, a powerful Chief of the Tehama, and Sheriff Houssain ibn Ali Hyder, whose influence was supported solely by his holy character as a Syud of the Aschaaffee tribe. &lt;f Through the machinations of one Hadj Yusef, a wealthy merchant yet residing at Hodeida, Sheriff Houssain was left in charge of the seaport towns on the withdrawal of the Pasha's troops. A promise was made through Hadj Yusef of a certain sum annually to His Highness Mehemet Ali, and there is reason to believe that a large amount was paid into the Egyptian Treasury; but no sooner did the wily Chief find himself strong enough to stand alone- than he at once declared himself independent, and, not satisfied with requiring the submission of the Imaum of Senna, was insolent enough to require the British to relinquish Aden, or to profess the Mahomedan faith, on pain of extermination. 'Flushed with success, this Chief, in 1840, had the presumption to cut down the English flagstaff at Mocha and to treat it with the greatest indignity, issuing at the same time an edict that no Christian should be allowed to ride in or near Mocha, and confining the ingress and egress to one gate.25 'Hearing that this last insult would not be permitted to pass unpunished, the SherifF, at the eleventh hour, professed himself a subject of the Sublime Porte ; and a representation of his conduct having consequently been forwarded to Her Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople, a Khojakhan of the High Divan, EschrefF Bey, was dispatched to receive the submission of the Sheriff and to remove him from his government. SherifF Houssain was, how ever, too firmly seated to be moved by means of a power so far distant as the Porte. A handsome pre sent (as is notorious in all the towns of the Tehama) was made to the Envoy, and the SherifF permitted for three years longer to enjoy his possessions undis turbed, whilst the reparation due to the British for the insult of 1840 was still withheld. 'In 1847 EschrefF Bey again visited Sherift Houssain, when a firman and a Neshan were pre sented as from the Porte, but which T am assured by creditable and respectable merchants residing there were both forgeries; and affairs remained in this state till the early part of 1848, when His Highness the Imaum of Senna, marching down with a large force, overthrew the Sheriff's army, retook Mocha, Zebeid, and Brit-el-Tukeh, and Sheriff Houssain became a prisoner in the hands of the Dhu Mahomed and Dhu Houssain tribes, who, after keeping him in durance several weeks, released him on payment of 20,000 German crowns, and he is now again collecting a force to recover his posses sions in the Tehama. 'The Imaum of Senna and the Sheriff are now opposed to each other; and as the inclination of the tribes vacillate, so turns the tide of success, Turkish troops are shortly expected; and the war like tribe of the Assyr have descended from their mountains in force with the avowed intention of overrunning the whole of the Tehama, and, after plundering all the towns, reselling them to the highest bidder. ' Sheriff Houssain has no power, save that conse quent upon the wealth he amassed from the Customs and compulsory levies upon merchants, which owing to the late events, has rapidly diminished. No part of the coast belongs to him by right; and his being thus placed at the head of affairs will therefore be resisted by every Chief in the Yemen, more espe- [201] h26 daily by the Assyrs, who have already demanded from him a tribute of 30,000 German crowns per annum. His uncompromising hostility, and the bitter hatred he openly expresses towards all Europeans, is well known to the inhabitants of the Arabian and African coasts within and without the Red Sea; and his elevation to Pasha and the Order of the Crescent, of which I received information from Jedda on the 22nd instant, will therefore have a most injurious effect on the minds of the half- civilized tribes resident in southern Arabia and north-eastern Africa, a tendency to induce a belief that the Porte has taken the part of the Sheriff of Abou Arish against the English nation; and that his avowed detestation of all Christians, so far from interfering with his advancement, has been rewarded by the dignified rank of a Pasha. 'Under these circumstances I would, with ^great respect, submit that Sheriff Houssain ibn Ali Hyder is-not the Chief best adapted for the Govern ment of the Yemen. If the Porte has in reality any just claim to the country, then surely the Vice gerent left by the Khalifat of former years ought to be the Chief selected, and the Vicegerent, who even yet retains the title of the ' Sword erf the Khalifat,' is the Imaum of Senna. Allowing the Imaum declines to submit to the authority of the Sultan of Constantinople, then it still remains to send down a Turkish officer to govern alone the seaport towns of the Yemen, as they were governed during the time they were in the hands of the Pasha of Egypt.' In July 1849, another incident occurred: the India Board, August 31, 1849, Sheriff Ibu Town of Mecca, and Toufleck Pasha, Turkish officer, left Hodeida and visited the Imaum of Senna: they all returned together to Hodeida, where the Imaum was received with a royal salute and princely honours in the name of the Sultan, and a few days later the following arrangement was agreed upon between the respective parties ' First. That the country held by the Imaum of Senna should continue under his Government, but be considered as the territory of the Porte, and under the sovereignty of the Turkish Sultan. ' Secondly. That the revenues should be divided, one half being paid into the Treasury of the Sultan and the remainder applied to benefit the country27 and maintain its civil, judicial, and military law, and that 1,000 soldiers of the Porte should be placed in the fortresses to maintain order and obedience from unruly tribes. 'Thirdly. That the Imaum should receive for his personal expenses and to support his dignity, 3,700 German crowns monthly from the revenues before the deduction for the Turkish Treasury is made.'' In reporting to the Bombay Government the conclusion of this arrangement, the Political Agent at Aden, said— 'The present Imaum of Senna perfectly under stands the Turkish character, and he is, I firmly believe, acting a wily part towards them, which a few months will elucidate. He required money, and he has continued to obtain by bribes, gifts, &amp;c., from the Turks, 25,000 German crowns, 17,000 of which was levied on the merchants of Mocha and Hodeida, to be repaid to them in their Custom account. 'The object of the Turks is, no doubt, to throw ithe whole interior trade into Mocha and Hodeida, but, as far as I can see, disappointment will ensue. The trade at the seaport towns will be ruined by extortion, and no financial benefit result from their arrangements inland. The taxation and tribute- money will be resisted, from the Turkish power being too weak to enforce it. Further, if small Turkish detachments advance to use compulsory measures, an expense must be entailed, and they will soon find themselves critically placed, if not entirely surrounded, their retreat impracticable, and disgrace inevitable.' The Political Agent at Aden was, therefore, of opinion that no good would accrue to Turkey from this arrangement, bearing in mind that Ibrahim Pasha, only fifteen years previously, had failed in his endeavours to subjugate the mountain Arab tribes, who had repeatedly defeated the disciplined troops of Egypt. These tribes, he stated, had their own Chiefs, who had never acknowledged sovereignty, and who had not been consulted in the above arrangement, nor 4 were they likely to accept it unless compelled by force, which neither the Turks nor the Imaum had the power or means to do. In the early part of this Memorandum allusion is30 at Massowah for the purpose of opening out trade with Abyssinia, but the Chief Ruler of the country resided at Gondar, situated far in the interior, and not in Tigr^, the Province nearest to the coast; Consul Plowden therefore suggested the establish ment of a commercial intercourse with the interior of Abyssinia, vid Amphylla, but the want was felt of an established Ruler with whom Treaties mi^ht be entered into. Consul Plowden observed that the Turks might of course lay the same claim to it that they did even to Abyssinia, but that they had not hitherto occupied it. No good survey of the harbour or roadstead then existed, arid Consul Plowden suggested that one should be made, as he stated Amphylla was far easier of access than Massowah. A correspondence accordingly passed with the Nos. 66, 67, 68, ] 11, and 112. Admiralty and India Office on the subject, but it w'tis ultimately decided not t(&gt; make any further survey, as it was well known that Amphylla had no port. In 1849 Massowah was restored by Egypt to the Nos. 70 and 100. Sublime Porte, When it reverted to the Pashalic of Jeddah. No. 134. Suakin Was at the same time restored to Turkey. In the same year the mainland opposite the Island No. 78. of Massowah was occupied by Turkish troops ; the French Agent there supported the Turkish claim, but it was disputed by the Chief of Tigr^ who made a descent upon the coast and burnt the town of Moncooloo, and Consul Plowden expressed a hope that the British Government, if appealed to, would declare that if did not consider the possession of the Island of Massowah to involve any authority over the coast. It is not a little singular that it was in November of this year (1849) a Treaty was concluded by Hertslet's Treaties, vol. ix, page L Consul Plowden in the name of the Queen of Great Britain with the King of Abyssinia, in which, amongst other things, they mutually engaged ' to keep open and to secure the avenues of approach betwixt the sea coast and Abyssinia.' The question of French designs was now revived. In April, 1850, the ex-French Consular Agent Nos. 124a and 177. at Massowah wrote to the British Agent in Egypt, offering to make over to the British Government a district named Edd, latitude 14°, longitude 41°, ^ A31 situated a little to the south of Amphylla, which, he stated, had been purchased by a French Company from the native Ruler in August, 184D, but Lord Palmerston did not think it necessary to take any notice of the proposal. But with regard to the question of sovereignty, Mr. Murray, the British Agent in Egypt, pointed out that the district of Edd (Ayd) could not be considered as belonging to the Turkish Empire, as the proprietors from whom ;the French Company made the original purchase vwere Abyssinian Christians. In April 1852 the British Consul at Massowah, ~Mr. Plowden, reported that a French corvette, the '' Eurydice,' of 32 guns, had been frequenting the Red Sea during the preceding twelve months; and he stated that he was nearly certain that the French Government intended to take up a position on the &lt;?oast whenever practicable. The French Government, however, assured Lord (Cowley that it had no design of occupying any part 'of the African coast, either at Amphylla, as was reported, or elsewhere. In February 1853 the Turkish Pasha of Massowah ordered an expedition by land and sea against Amphylla, to assert there the authority of the Sultan and to receive tribute ; but a powerful demonstration having been made by the Shihos, and a threat having been made by them to plunder the whole country in rear of the Turkish troops as far as Massowah, the expedition was abandoned. Nevertheless Lord Malmesbury instructed Lord Stratford de Redcliffe to keep alive the jealousy of the Porte as to any French establishments being formed in the Red Sea; and in course of conver sation with Lord Stratford, Ali Pasha told him that nothing should induce the Porte to give France a portion on their coast of the Red Sea. With reference to the projected Turkish Expedi tion to Amphylla, Consul Plowden stated that the Turkish Pasha had asked him publicly if he con sidered Abyssinia as a Pashalic of the Sultan, and that he had simply replied that he had no information on the subject; but he added that it was certain that both Egypt and Constantinople had never ceased to covet the possession of that fine country. In the following year the Turkish Governor of Massowah behaved in such an offensive and over-32 bearing manner to the British Consul (Plowden) that his punishment by his Government was demanded. Lord Stratford de Redcliffe accordingly addressed a note to the Turkish. Government, in which he said, alluding to a Turkish Agent being left in a remote island, 'it cannot enter into the views of No. 416. the Porte to claim dominion over a country which she has never occupied; to grasp at extension of territory when the administration of what she holds, without dispute, requires her undisturbed solicitude ; to menace the independence of other countries when her own is an object of arduous conflict; or to obstruct those channels of commercial intercourse on which so high a price was laid by the most devoted of her allies.' (This was during the Crimean War.) This firm language Lord Stratford de Redcliffe No. 416. stated was absolutely necessary, to let the Porte perceive that Her Majesty's Government were determined to discountenance that scheme of un principled and unwarrantable pretensions as to Abyssinia, of which so many indications had been given by its authorities in the Red Sea; and it was entirely approved by Her Majesty's Government. In consequence of this note from Lord Stratford No. 417. de Redcliffe the Porte issued instructions to the Kaimakam of Magsowah with regard to his future conduct; but as they were far from amounting to a frank disapproval of the pretensions attributed to the Porte with regard to Abyssinia, Lord Stratford No. 426. stated it to be his intention to address a further note to the Porte on the subject; and which met with the approval of Her Majesty's Government. No, 427. Shortly after this King Theodore came into note, and after having subdued Shoa, and compelled the Gallas and other tribes to acknowledge his authority, he professed his intention of seizing Massowah, in order to open a communication from northern Abyssinia with the Red Sea. The British Agent in Egypt then addressed a note No. 459 0 to Lord Stratford, in which he pointed out that direct trade with Abyssinia would gradually be developed so soon as the Suez Canal should be opened; and how other Governments would then find a pretext for founding a settlement on the shores of the Red Sea. He asked how far it would be consistent with British interests that any such33 settlement should be formed, and whether it would not be possible to induce the Porte to consent to the transfer of the island of Massowah to Abyssinia, which would give the Abyssinians access to the Red Sea, and bring them into contact with civilization. This suggestion met with the approval of Lord Clarendon, and Lord Stratford was instructed to advise the Porte to enter into an arrangement for the transfer of Massowah, which appeared to be of no importance to Turkey, and which it was thought she would not be able to protect, in the event of the operations contemplated by the Ruler of Abyssinia being carried into effect. But owing to the turn which matters took in Abyssinia, no further steps were taken in the matter. On the 30th March, 1856, a Treaty of Peace between the Allies and Russia was signed at Paris, whereby the territorial integrity of the Ottoman Empire was guaranteed, but what that ' territory ' comprised was not defined. It may here be well to say a few words about the Island of Pjiim. In November 1856 it was proposed that the Government of Bombay should take possession of the Island of Perim, situated at the entrance of the Red Sea. In August preceding Brigadier Coghlan, Political Resident at Aden, drew up a report on the island, in which he stated that, in the event of the projected ship canal through the Isthmus of Suez being accomplished, the occupation of Perim would assist British preponderance in that quarter, which it was so desirable should be maintained. He also said that the French had surveyed the island, and that the Trench Government were re commended to occupy it ; but Brigadier Coghlan remarked that, if the place was in the hands of the English, it would extinguish the extensive slave traffic then being carried on between Zailah, Tadjoura, the Zanzibar Coast, and the ports of Yemen; and that a small, inexpensive naval establishment at that point would suffice to watch the straits and search every vessel passing either way. With regard to the sovereignty over the island, he stated that it was occupied by the British troops when en route to and from Egypt at tne com- [201] K34 mencement of the present century, although probably, if the Porte were asked if they claimed it, they would say tff Yes' ? just as they claimed alt Yemen, without exercising any rule over a great part of it. The island was taken possession of in the name of the East India Company in ] 799, but it was evacuated, with the approval of Lord Wellesley, who saw no use then in the occupation of it or of Aden. On the 4th February, 1857, Brigadier Coghlan reported to the Government of Bombay that the Island of Perini had been re-occupied by the English on the 26th of January preceding, with the avowed object of erecting a lighthouse for the im provement of the navigation of the Red Sea. In July 1857, the question of Edd was once more revived. It was then reported that the Dankalis had sold this village to the French for No 50,000 fr. On the arrival of the persons, however, in Sep- No. tember following, sent by the French to occupy the place, they were refused possession by the Dankalis of the village; upon which it was rumoured that an expedition was to be organized by the agent of a French mercantile house at Cairo and Marseilles (M. Pastre), for the forcible occupation of the place. Consul Plowden also drew attention to the French No proceedings in this neighbourhood, and gave the following account of them. He stated that eighteen or twenty years previously, which would be about the year 1837 or 1839 (the date' given by Mr. C. A. Murray was August 1840), two Frenchmen, MM. Combe and Tamisier, purchased, or declared themselves to have purchased from ' certain savages of the Danakil tribe, a strip of land near the African coast of the Red Sea, with a small harbour about 65 or 70 miles south of Massowah, and marked in the English maps as Edd ; that this territory was not occupied by any one; but that, subsequently, M. de Goutier, previously French Consular Agent at Massowah, openly declared him self to be the proprietor of Edd, by right of pur chase from Messrs. Combe and Tamisier. But the question of establishing Lighthouses and laying down Telegraph cables in the Red Sea has35 opened the question of sovereignty over the coast and island in that sea. In 1858 it was determined to lay down the electric telegraph to India, and towards the close of that year Her Majesty's Ambassador at Constanti- To Sir H. Bulwer, November 25, nople (Sir H. Bulwer) was instructed by Lord Sir 1 H 8 Bul W er, No. 418, December Ma| mesbury to obtain from the Sultan the necessary 7, 1858. Firmans to enable the cable to be laid along Turkish territory without impediment. Sir H. Bulwer accordingly obtained two Firmans, one addressed to the Governor-General of Bagdad, and the other to the Governor of the Yemen, setting / o forth that, as it might be necessary for the purposes of the telegraph between Aden and India, to bring the cable to the shore at one or two points on the coast of Arabia on the ocean eastward of Aden, the local authorities were enjoined to see that no impediments were thrown in the way of that operation. No. 3, January 8, 1859. On hearing of the issue of these Firmans, Brigadier Coghlan addressed a despatch to the British Agent in Egypt (Mr. Green), in which he made the follow ing remarks:— The Firman 4 authorizes' the landing of the telegraphic cable, 'on one or two points on the , coast of Arabia,' and though the endorsement adds ' between Aden and India;' I presume that nothing more is meant, than an authority to the Turkish Governor in Yemen to permit it to be landed any where in the Turkish possessions, which extend as far east as the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeh, and no further. ' The territorial pretensions of the Porte are boundless; the Sultan is ever ready to assume the sovereignty of any Mohamedan country; this dis position should not be lost sight of, as awkward complications may hereafter arise if any act of ours should give even an implied recognition to such pretensions. ' It is not yet known what points on the Arabian coast east of Aden, may be selected for landing the telegraphic cable. I assume, however, that some of the following will, probably, be chosen :— 1. Makeela; 2. Shehr; 3. The Kooria Mooria islands ; 4. Massera; 5. Ras-el-Hadd. ' Of these 1, 2, 4, and 5, are the only points where any Governments exist sufficiently powerful36 to afford adequate protection to the telegraphic establishments. The first and second are governed by independent chiefs, who have always shown a friendly disposition towards the British ; the third are already partly the property of Her Majesty, to whom three of the islands were ceded by the Imaum of Muscat in 1854 ; the fourth and the fifth belong to the Imaum ; but as no one of them will admit even a nominal subjection to the Porte, I apprehend that the Firman is worthless as an authority out side the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb; indeed, it is probable that along the whole sea-board from Mocha to Muscat no person will be found capable to read it.' On receipt of the Firman by Consul-General Treasury, March 19, 1859. Kemball at Bagdad, he immediately addressed a India Office, April 4, 1859 communication to Her Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople, in which he stated his reason for suspending the delivery of the Firman to Omar Pasha for the landing of the telegraph cable on the south east coast of Arabia; these reasons being the advisa bility of not recognizing the authority of the Sublime Porte over the native tribes of that coast. Mr. Kem- ball's conduct was entirely approved, and the Political Agents at Aden and Zanzibar were instructed to avoid acting in any way that might commit the British Government to the recognition of any claim to future rights or privileges as to disputed territory should any uncertainty on these points exist. The points on the western shore chosen by the Mr. Green, No. 28; India Telegraph Company to establish telegraph March 13, 1859. stations were Suez, Kosseir, and Suakin ; the neces sary application was accordingly made by Mr. Green to the Egyptian Government to permit a station to be fixed at Kosseir, which was then the only point beyond Suez within Egyptian jurisdiction, for although the country around Suakin was governed by the \ iceroy of Egypt, Suakin itself was garrisoned by Turkish troops, and was under a Governor appointed by the Sultan. xnssion havin^ been given by the Viceroy for the erection of the landmark at Kosseir, it was at once erected, but in June following it was torn down by the fanatical Hadjis; and at the recom mendation of the Consul at Alexandria, the attention of the Admiralty was, in consequence, called to the advisability, not only of keeping a sufficient naval37 No. 576. Sir H. Bulwer, No. 329 ; May U, 1859. No. 282, May 12. India Office, May 21, 1859. June 23. force in the Red Sea, but of causing the principal ports to be visited by Her Majesty's cruizers; and instructions were at once issued by the Admiralty for this to be done. A similar suggestion respecting the presence of a British naval force in the Red Sea had been made by Consul Plowden in the previous year. In May of this year (1859) another question arose, which has an important bearing on the present question. A French Company at Constantinople made an offer to a certain person there to go to the Red Sea and purchase 'an island called Socotra, which com manded its mouth, and which belonged to an Arab Chief.' « On hearing of this proposal, the following telegram was sent by Lord Malmesbury to Sir H. Bulwer:— 'Make the Porte refuse the island to which the following reply was returned :—'Fuad Pasha thinks that the island of Socotra at the mouth of the Red Sea belongs to the Imaum of Muscat, but if it turns out that the Porte has jurisdiction over it, he will give the order required.' Upon this, the India Office was asked whether it would not be advisable that some steps should be taken to influence the Imaum of Muscat against the sale of Socotra ; to which they returned the following reply ' It appears from the records of the India Office that, in the year 1835, an attempt was made on the part of the British Government to purchase the island from the # Sultan of Kisseen, and that, in anticipation of the completion of this arrangement, a British detachment was posted on the island. The Sultan, however, refused to sell the island, and the detachment was withdrawn. ' A very interesting memoir on the island of Socotra, communicated by the late Lieutenant J. R. Wellsted, of the Indian navy, was published in the Journal of the Royal Geographical Society for 1835 (Vol. V). The island, from its position 'directly in the route of the trade from India by way of the Red Sea (the entrance of which it may be said to command), and close to the track of our ships by the way of the Cape,' must be of more than ordi nary political importance. In 1800, when the French army were in Egypt, it is alleged that [201] L38 Commodore Blanket was authorized to take posses sion of it, but did not do so. The Sultan of Kisseen on the Arabian coast, is the acknowledged Sovereign of the island. ' For the above reasons it is of importance that foreign influences should be excluded from the island. Sir C. Wood, therefore, concurs in opinion with the Earl of Malmesbury, that steps should be taken to dissuade the proprietor of Socotra from selling the island to the French, and he will accord ingly address the Political Agent at Aden and the Government of Bombay, on the subject.' In July following, the question of the purchase of Sir H. Bulwer, No. 19. the island by the French was again spoken of, but SirH. Bulwer was informed that the island belonged to the Sultan of Kisseen, and that steps would be taken by the British authorities in India to prevent the proprietors from selling it to the French. Simultaneously with the question of laying the To Mr. Colquhoun, No. 2; T , . c ■ September 29, 1859. telegraph to India, arose the question of erecting lighthouses in the E-ed Sea, and in September 1859, it was decided to erect them at Suez, at Abdul Kheesan, or Dasdalus Shoal ; and Usteraffa or Isihaffa Reef, with a beacon on Shed wan in the Straits of Jubal. These places are marked on the accompanying map. Ma P* In announcing this decision to the British Agent in Egypt, he was told that it was believed that these places were within the limits of the Pashalic of Egypt, but, that in order to . guard against any objections being raised by the Porte, Her Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople had* been directed to obtain the formal sanction of the Sultan to the construction of lighthouses in those places, which was at once granted. In this same year (1859), the French Consular Nos. 675 and 698. Agent at Aden was drowned in crossing from Hodeida to Tadjourah in a native boat belonging to Burton, p. 26. the Port of Zeilah, outside the Straits of Bab-el- Mandeb; and the course adopted by the French on that occasion indirectly raised the question of sovereignty over Zeilah. The Governor of Zeilah was accused of havino: instigated the natives to murder M. Lambert ; Captain Playfair and Captain Sherard Osborn pro- Qy. Brigadier Coghlan; see ceeded to the spot, and after making the most careful examination into all the circumstances of the21. n 39 Burtoiij page 26. Nos. 675 and 698. No. 753. Burton, p. 26. Nos. 622 and 627. No. 627. case, came to the conclusion that it was a simple case Of shipwreck; the boat in which he was sailing having struck on a reef near the Mussah Islands. A copy of the Report made by the British Officers was communicated to the French Govern ment, but they nevertheless sent a ship of war, 'Le Somme,' to Zeilah, in 1860, when they arrested the Governor (Shermaki), appointed another individual as his successor, and then con veyed Shermaki and several natives to the i \.rabian coast to be tried for murder. Captain Burton states that they were first con veyed to Hodeida 'within whose jurisdiction Zeilah and Tadjourah arethat the Governor refused to act in the matter, and that the French Captain thereupon proceeded to Jeddah, where he appealed to the Governor-General of the Yemen, who also declined to interfere ; whether this was so or not our correspondence does not show ; but Mr. Colquhoun reported that Shermaki and five or six others were taken to Jeddah in the hope of ; inducing the Governor of that place to take charge &lt; of the prisoners till they could be sent to Constan tinople ; but that the Governor declined to have anything to do with them as prisoners. While these pourparlers were being carried on Sbermaki(who was an old man, and had always been very friendly to the English), died on board the French man-of-war in the harbour, and the French ship then left Jeddah for France with the other prisoners on board. It was generally believed that all the accused were innocent, and that unfair means had been used to get up the charge against them. France then appealed to the Porte for redyess, and the Turkish Government consented to pay an indemnity of 30,000 dollars to France, and to make over the revenues of Icemen to the French Govern ment until the indemnity was paid. In December of this year the French made their appearance again in the neighbourhood of Massowah. On the 12th December a steam merchant-ship (the 'Yemen') arrived at Massowah from Alex andria, having on board M. Pastre, a French naval captain (Eoussel), two military officers, a certain Father Sapetto, and others, and on the 17th she started for Zullah, in the Bay of Adolis, a port half40 a day distant from Massowah. On their arrival the members of the expedition pitched their tents on the beach, and at first lived with the Agent of Ijaib Iberis, Governor of the Mainland. But after a few days (on the 29th) a party of ten persons started on No. 622. an expedition, first to the Ruler of Tigr6, for the purpose of recognizing him as the independent King Beke, p. 25. of Tigre and Samien, and then of proceeding to Gondar for the purpose of conveying certain 'orders' to King; Theodore from the French Emperor. Among the presents from France to the Ruler of Tigre was a large seal, bearing the inscrip tion 'King of Tigre and Samien,' in Amharic characters. But owing to the distracted state of the country, and the war between King Theodore and the rebel Chief of Tigre, Captain RoussePs mission No. 643. was unable to carry out its intentions; and on the 31st December the French vessel returned to No ' 627 • Massowah. But on the 4th January, 1860, an Arab boat arrived at Massowah, from Jeddah, with fifty-five cases of arms, twenty-one were from the Emperor of the French, to the Ruler of Tigre, and the remainder were taken to the French Consular residence at Moncooloo on the mainland ; it being generally believed that the Naib of Arkeeko was acting in concert with the French. On the 16th of that month, Brigadier-General Coghlan, accompanied by the Reverend Mr. Badger, left Aden on a trip up the Red Sea. They visited Perim, Massowah, the ruins of Adoolis, Zulla, in Annesley Bay, and Disseh. At Massowah, General Coghlan found the Turks very suspicious of the French proceedings, not only No. 627. on the mainland and in the neighbourhood, but even on the island itself, a firman having been obtained from the Porte conceding to the French a portion of the northern side of the island whereon to erect a projected church. After making a careful examination of Annesley Bay, General Coghlan came to the conclusion that neither Adoolis (which has no separate defensible harbour) nor Zulla were likely to be fixed upon by the French for a naval station, or for their principal settlement in that quarter. But no sooner had he seen Disseh (or Island of Orme) and made a cursory survey of the place,41 then he felt convinced that, as a place of residence for Europeans, as a naval station, and as a strong strategical position, giving almost absolute command of Annesley Bay, a better spot could not be selected, and he said that it had been described by others as one of the pleasantest spots in the Red Sea. The Chief was absent when General Co^hlan arrived, but he spol&lt;e to a young man who acted as Chief in his elder brother's absence, and from him he learnt that several of the Chiefs relations were employed as coolies in the coal depots at Aden, and that their intercourse with the English had given the people of Disseh a high sense of the power and good government of the English nation, and they expressed a hope that they would come at once and settle on the island. The Acting Chief also informed General Coghlan that a French mission had landed, surveyed, and taken plans of every part of the island; that they had told the people the island was now theirs as well as all the country round Zulla, although they were not told who it was that had made over the island to the French Government; that they had stated that they would forthwith open a large trad^ with Abyssinia, which would add greatly to the prosperity of the island; and that in two months from that time many French ships would come from the west to take possession of Disseh, and to carry out their ulterior projects. General Coghlan was then shown a large wooden cross which the French had erected on a rock close to the island, but which had been blown or taken down, on which was painted in large letters, 'Yemen, 1859,' and was. afterwards conducted towards the largest of the bays on the southern part of the island, where he found two square pieces of canvas tied to a couple of trees ; surveying points marked on the rocks forming the harbour; and a line of sticks fixed along the beach, as if used for measurement, clearly denoting that this was the locality chosen by the French for the establishment of their settlement. The general report was that the only title the French had to this possession was a gift from the Ruler of Tigre, who was himself a rebel against the Emperor of Abyssinia. [201] M42 General Coghlan remarked that the Emperor of Abyssinia, after the fashion of the earlier Sultans of Turkey, styled himself ' Lord of the land and sea,' and that he might therefore possibly claim the Island of Disseh as belonging to him, but that such claim might reasonably be regarded as invalid. TKe Porte, he said, would of course claim the island as theirs, although he knew for certain that neither the Kaimakam of Massowah nor Ali Bey had any very definite idea where it was situated, or whether the inhabitants were tributary to the Porte or not; which coincided with the repeated declarations of the islanders that they paid no taxes whatever, either to the Porte or to the Naib of Arkeeko: they also stated that a firman, securing their perfect independence, had been conceded to their ancestor, Sheikh Adam, by Sultan Selim, when he conquered Arabia and took several places in the Red Sea. General Coghlan further stated that another claimant to the island was the Naib of Arkeeko, who seemed to stand in the same relation to the Porte as Sheikh ul Arab, of Mesopotamia, who exercised a certain degree of authority over the tribes on the coast of the mainland, and received investiture from the Divan of Jeddah, but who was virtually as independent of the Porte as the scattered tribes nominally under his supervision. General Coghlan considered that these proceed ings of the French deserved the serious attention of Her Majesty's Government, and he expressed his opinion that they portended disagreeable complica^ tions, which, in the event of hostilities between the two nations, might seriously interfere with British connections with India ; and he therefore suggested that the British Government might favour the purchase of the island to Mr. Gordon for telegraphic purposes, should it be judged that the natives had a right to dispose of it, on the understanding that Mr. Gordon would transfer the island to the Crown. With regard to Perim, General Coghlan suggested that it should be strongly fortified, and he concluded his report with a few observations with regard to Aden. He observed that the station was wholly dependent upon extraneous sources for all supply of food, and he therefore recommended that a good stock of43 grain should be kept on hand, and stacked in granaries, as was done at Malta; that a large stock of coal be also kept there and available for State purposes; and he repeated a suggestion which had been submitted on former occasions, that two small steamers should be kept permanently stationed at Aden) chiefly with a view of maintaining a regular communication with the Red Sea, and with the Arabian and Soumali coasts. This report was sent to Lord Cowley at Paris, who, on the 25th May following, wrote a despatch to Lord John Russell, in which he said :— 'M. Thouvenel, having seen in the public papers that Captain Roussel had taken possession of the Island of Dissee in the Red Sea, took occasion, while the Ministers were assembled in Council in the Emperor's presence, to ask the Hinister of Marine what foundation there was for the report. Admiral Hamelin admitted its accuracy. M. Thouvenel 'then, appealing to the Emperor, said that, it was v very extraordinary that a transaction of this nature • and importance, and which related to foreign matters, should have been accomplished without any previous communication with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who might be called upon at any moment for expla- natious on the subject. 'M. Thouvenel went on to say that, on seeing the report in the papers, he had made inquiries in his Department, but had not been able to find a trace of any correspondence relating to it between his pre decessor and the Minister of Marine, and that most assuredly had any question been put to him by the British Ambassador regarding the truth of the state ment, he should at once have denied it. He argued that the taking possession of this island was a most impolitic act; that, if it was intended as a demon stration against England, it would fail of effect, and might possibly induce the British Government to endeavour to obtain possession of other ports on the Red Sea; and that, moreover, the Porte had a cer tain prescriptive right of sovereignty in those waters, and that the Commercial Treaties between France and Turkey were applicable to them, 'The Emperor observed that he did not consider the matter to be of much importance, and that the conversation dropped.'44 In speaking to Lord Cowley upon the subject a No. 626. few days later, M. Thouvenel declared that he knew nothing about, but admitted that the French Government had some idea of forming a coaling O O station on the Red Sea. Captain Roussel, the head of the French Mission No. 643. previously alluded to, passed through Alexandria on his way back to France in May 1860, and General Coghlan took an opportunity of conversing with him on. the subject of lighthouses which it was then in contemplation to erect in the Red Sea, and as a commencement of a series of lights, the Zafarana Point, the Ushruffee and Doedalus shoals were con sidered by him as the only proper ones. Nothing was then said about the sovereignty of these places. In December following (1860) Lord Cowley was No. 663. instructed to ascertain the views of the French Government in regard to Abyssinia and the western coast of the Red Sea, His Lordship accordingly called upon M. Thouvenel, but found him 'very ignorant' on the subject ; indeed, he admitted his ignorance respecting these countries, but Lord Cowley stated that he really believed the French Government had no fixed policy in those regions beyond a desire to appear to be the protector of the Roman Catholic religion. In the same month General Coghlan reported that December 18, i860 the agent of a new French Company, formed under the Imperial guarantee, for navigating the Red Sea and farther East (M. Lamouroux) had passed through Aden a few weeks previously, and had boasted of the manner in which Aden was to be ' done up ' by his countrymen ; and had stated that, in addition to the long-contemplated settlement at Disseh (Valentia Island), it was intended to form another on the African coast immediately opposite Perim. Upon hearing this the Political Agent at Aden recommended that this plan should be frustrated by inducing the Telegraph Company , to make Disseh one of its stations, as its occupation by the Company under a Firman from the Porte would, in all proba- j a , luar , 2( 186u bnity, suffice to keep the French out. They were accordingly recommended, through General Coghlan, to do this. In January 1861 a French ship of war visited No. 704. Disseh and Adoolis, and presented the Sheik of the45 Island of Disseh with a barrel of gunpowder and a musket, and the people of Disseh believed that their island had been sold to them by their Sheikh. But, in December following, the Kaimakan of Massowah sent a Governor and some soldiers to Disseh, to take possession of the island and neigh bourhoods, and on the 14th of that month the Turkish flag was hoisted in that place. The 'neighbourhoods' here alluded to were, no doubt, Adoolis and Edd, as Captain Cameron reported on the 20th March, 1862, that the Turkish flag had been planted at Disseh, Adoolis, and Edd; that the Turkish Government intended to extend its hold on the coast to Babelmandeb; that Governors had been appointed to Disseh and Adoolis, and a Sheik in the country placed in power at Edd. Upon these proceedings of the Turks, Consul Cameron made the following remarks:— ' There may be an advantage in this, so far as insures that these main points of the coast line should be in the possession of a power by whom they would hardly be used to our disadvantage. ' It is my duty, however, to point out that one of the results of this firm establishment of Turkey along the African coast will be an extension of the Slave Trade, of which it has so long been the seat— and a strengthening of the hands of the Mussulman o o population on the Abyssinian frontier, which they are sure to abuse. ' The Governor, in fact, of this place, who has so far carried out the above plans, meditates planting military Colonies along the frontier, and furnishing them with several thousand fire-arms from Jeddah, and whether this be done or not, his general animus cannot be mistaken. 'Itis the advancement of Turkey at the expense of Abyssinia. ' The ofiicers of King Theodore, on the other hand, are watching these movements with jealousy. There are at this moment here emissaries from his Viceroy at Adowa, who have been specially ordered to pass along the coast, and report on the proceedings of the Turks. 'The question, indeed, touches King Theodore doubly—first, as the avowed champion of Coptic Christendom, and more materially, on account of the salt mines of Taltal, whence .the Abyssinians of thf [201J N46 interior draw the rock salt, which forms their circu lating medium, as well as the sulphur mines in the same neighbourhood, which they use for manufac turing powder. 'Both of these lie in dangerous proximity to Adoolis' On the 29th April, 1861, a Treaty of Commerce, Hertslet's Treaties, vol. xi, p. 567. &amp;c., was concluded between England and Turkey, by the XXth Article of which it was declared that, it should receive its execution ' in all the provinces of the Ottoman Empire situated in Europe, in Asia, in Egyyt, and in the other parts of Africa belonging to the Sublime Porte, in Servia, Moldavia and Wallachia;' but what those African possessions were, was not defined. In the early part of the year 1862 the natives of Zeyla who had been wrongly accused of the murder of M, Lambert, and taken to France, were conveyed back to their country in a French ship of war from Suez, on board of which was M. Schaeffer, Chief Dragoman to the French Embassy at Constan tinople. Mr. Colquhoun, Her Majesty's Consul-General in Mr. Colquhoun, No. 63; Egypt, reported that M. Schaeffer had passed 10 ' 1862 ' through Egypt under a feigned name ; and as it was known that he was provided with a considerable sum of money, it was supposed that the object he had in view was the purchase of territory in the neighbourhood of the Red Sea for the use of the French Navy. Tn fact, M. Thouvenel admitted to Lord Cowley Earl Cowley, No. 752 that he had sent M. Schaeffer to Massowah for the June 6 ' 1862 ' purpose of obtaining a coaling station for the line of French steamers about to be established in the Red Sea; but he assured his Lordship that there was no foundation for the report that France meditated acquirements or conquests on that Sea. A desert spot called Agos or Abos (Obokh), he observed, had been pointed out to the Minister of Marine, as affording a safe harbour and good water, and it was hoped that a depot for coals might be found there; but, with regard to M. Schaeffer travelling under a false name, M. Thouvenel assured Lord Cowley that it was only done to escape the jealous observation of British agents. It afterwards transpired that as the French vessel Dr. Beke; descended the Red Sea a careful survey was made June 14,1862.47- of the coast from Massowah to Zeyla, and that although the French had by their proceedings with regard to Zeyla recognized the Sovereignty of the Porte over that place, the officers on board the French ship of war had purchased from the native Governor of Tadjoura and Kahaita, for the sum of 10,000 dollars, a place called Obokh, situated half way between Perim and Tadjoura, and directly opposite Aden, and nearer to the Straits of Bab-el- Mandeb than Zeyla. This place they took formal Mr. Colquhoun, No. 756 ; possession of in the name of the Emperor Napoleon Junes, 1862. and t i ie French flag. It was further rumoured that the French were turning their atten tion again to Edd and Amphylla ; but Mr. Colquhoun reported that all these places were integral portions of the Turkish Empire, and were actually fanned out year by year by the Pasha of the Yemen, and he observed that, when the British authorities in the Red Sea had endeavoured to induce the Chiefs to abstain from the Slave Trade they had sheltered themselves under the pretext that they were Turkish subjects, and could not sell any portion of their ^ Sovereign's dominions. In the same year Dr. Beke stated that the French 4 were in treaty with the Akrali Arabs for the purchase of Little Aden (Jabel Hassan). Mr. Colquhoun, No. 84, Confidential; In the following year (1863) General Coghlan May 17, 1863. visited Obokh, and, from inquiries he made of the 'Chief Man' of the place, learned that the people of Obokh denied the right of the Sultan of Raheita to sell their country ; that they acknowledged as their Chief Mahomed Ali, who resided originally at JBosalee, distant two days'journey; and he had avowed his intention to oppose French occupation should it be again attempted. That one moiety of the 10,000 German crowns to be paid to the Sultan of Raheita had been paid through the agency of Deenee, an employe of the Governor ot Zeyla, and that the othei moiety was still due. That the French had set up two land marks and placed three buoys to distinguish the reefs in the harbour, and had then left the place; and that no sooner had they taken their departure than the people removed the marks and the buoys, which led to the rumour that the Donkali inhabitants had expelled the French by force. That there was no sign of any intention on the part of the French to occupy Obokh ; that they had neither material, nor48 establishment, nor agency on the spot; and that the character of the place suggested a doubt whether they at any time seriously intended to occupy the place. General Goghlan further stated that the single advantage which Obokh possessed was its abundant supply of good water which was easily to be found ; but that in every other respect the place is objectionable; that the harbour was not easy of access, the anchorage limited, and the bay or port exposed to the full force of the southerly winds: that, in fact, there was no port properly deserving the name. And he concluded his Report by stating that Obokh had no capabilities as a settlement, that it had no neighbourhood, that it produced nothing, lead nowhere, and was inconveniently far from the track of the Red Sea steamers, and that the fine plain to the westward of it was uninhabitable by reason of a pestilental marsh, which for at least half the year was directly to windward of it, and was so offensive at that time that no one would willingly pass a night in its vicinity. About this time a rumour reached the ears of the Lord Cowley, No. 1388; French Government that the British Government t) ecember 1862. had become possessed of the Island of Jubal in the 34 ' Red Sea, to which they staled they were prepared to object; but the rumour had no foundation. In the following year (1864) complaints were India Office, December 7, 1862 made against the interference of the Turkish Governor at Zeyla with native vessels trading between the African coast and Aden. Tt appeared that while the Porte claimed sovereignty over that coast, Zeyla was the only place actually occupied by the Turks, and that the Ottoman authorities insisted that all native vessels should, on every voyage, put into Zeyla to be taxed. Colonel Merewether complained of the great inconvenience caused by these proceedings, as the chief supply of provisions at Aden was obtained from the Somali coast; he also contested the Porte's claim to the sovereignty of the country south of Zeyla. Ali Pasha, in replying on behalf of the Porte, said that direct trade was prohibited with the ports of Krankariet and Donakariet, and represented the matter as being of the nature of a smuggling trans action, which the Turkish authorities were endea vouring to put a stop to. Ali Pasha's note was sent to India for observa- m49 tions, when Colonel Merewether sent the following report:— The small port of Zeyla, on the Somalee coast, was formerly a dependency of Mocha under the Imaum of Senna. It is farmed by the Imaum to individuals who paid a yearly tribute for the right of governorship to buy taxes, &amp;c. Before 1838, it had been farmed to various people at different times for different sums. Tn that year Syud Mahomed El Bar obtained possession, on condition of paying yearly to the Imaum of Senna 50U dollars. Shortly afterwards, Mahomed El Bar sold his right to Sheik Sharmarki, and, on the subsidence of the power of the Imaum, retained possession, and established himself independent of Mocha. Tajonen (Tadjoura), a small place on the opposite side of^ that name from Zeyla, has for long been a tributary of the latter place, so that to whomever Zeyla belonged, Tajonen belonged also, but no other place on the coast. In 1847, Zeylah *had again come under Mocha, with Shar marki as Governor, paying to the Sheriff of Mocha 700 dollars per annum. In 1857, Sharmarki had been deposed, and Abboo Bukhur appointed in his stead; but during that year, Sharmarki was re instated, on payment of a fine of 9,000 dollars to the Turkish Pasha, Governor of Hodeida, who at that time appears to have assumed all the power previously belonging to the Imaum of Senna, as regarded Mocha and its dependencies. It was afterwards supposed that Sharmarki was concerned in the murder near Zeyla of M. Lambert, Consular Agent of France ; and the Viscount de Sangle pro ceeded to Hodeida to press the charge against him. The result of the investigation was, that Sharmarki was removed, and imprisoned, while a sum of money was to be paid to the French Government as com pensation to M. Lambert's family, by the Turkish authorities of Hodeida, of which 8,000 dollars have up to this been handed over. Abboo Bukhur was appointed Governor of Zeyla in place of Sharmarki, and continues so still (1864), His native place is Ambobah, naer Tajonen. ' From the above it will be seen that Turkish authority has been exerted over Zeylah, and its one tributary Tajonen, but over nothing else, and most certainly not over all the Dunkali and Somalee countries. Tajonen is to. the north of Zeyla, up [201] Q 2-750 towards the entrance to the Red Sea. Kuramga- raitath and Durhamgaraitath are on the opposite side, south-south-east of Zeyla, and distant respec- tivaly 25 and 55 miles. The inhabitants of these two places declare they have nothing whatever to do with Zeyla, and do not wish to have anything to say to it. They, therefore, strongly object to the arbitrary proceedings of the Governor of Zeyla, when he tries to force them to come into Zeylah to be taxed merely for his benefit. The more he can get the better for himself, having only to pay a fixed sum to the Turkish authorities at Hodeida. His Excellency Ali Zamoor, Pasha, Governor of Hodeida, sent me a paper drawn up by certain individuals at Hodeida, in which it is stated by them that Kuram- garaitah and Durhamgaraitah belong to Zeyla; but such is simply the assertion of people not belonging to the country, and no valid proof; they might, with equal truth and justice say, that Bulbar aud Berbera, two Somalee ports to the eastward, werp under Zeylah. No Turkish flag mas ever planted at Kuramgaraitah or Durhamgaraitah. The attempt to place it would have been immediately resisted. The inhabitants at Zeyla, and those at Kuramgaraitah and Durhamgaraitah, although belonging to the great tribe of Somalee, are members of different sub-divisions, and acknowledge only the authority of their own local head in the same manner as the other Somalees along the north-east coast of Africa, from Zeyla down to the mouth of the River Juba, or as the independent Dunkalis from Tajonen up the western shore of the Red Sea. The power of the Governor of Zeyla does not extend landwards heyond the walls. If he confines himself to his own ports, there will be no complaints and no difficulty whatever; but if he is allowed to persist in using force against others, over whom he has no legiti mate control, constant hostilities will take place, and the tribes on the coast kept in a perpetual state of irritation, most injurious to trade, and utterly sub versive of that improvement in the state of these wild people, which it is so much an object to introduce. ' At this place. Bulbar, 'I found a number of inha bitants of Durhamgaraitah, who had come to trade, their families and flocks remaining at Durham garaitah. I caused the papers sent by the Ali51 State Papers, vol. Ivi, page 1167. Li... - Zamoor Pasha to be read to them ; they were most indignant, and one and all declared ' the statements in that paper to be utterly untrue. If it was meant that we, as well as the Turks, were true followers of Islam, that was correct enough; but if it was meant that we were subjects of the Sultan of Roum, is false. No Turkish flags were ever planted in our lands. We never paid allegiance or tribute to the Sheriff of Mocha. We know nothing of him, and have nothing to do with Zeyla. The Abdeen Mahomed, who is mentioned in the paper, was killed about eight years ago by us and others, because be suspected him of acting treacherously towards us with regards to the Turks.' The above are the exact words taken down from the mouth of Adoolah Mahomed Somallee, of the Ayah Goonus, an inhabitant of Durhamgaraith, and fully concurred |n by nine others present at the time he spoke. ' With reference to His Highness Ali Pasha's letter to Sir H. Bulwer, I would only further add, that there is no such person as Ishmad Borah in Government employ at Aden. There is a man of the name of Ishmad Borah on the Somalee coast, who occasionally visits Aden, being nacoda of a vessel, and he is an elder brother of Sharmarki. With regard to the complainants being Ottoman subjects, it did not appear to me at all proved so. On inquiry at the time I could not find that on any previous occasion had the two ports in question been considered as belonging to, or in any way under, Zeyla, I, therefore, declined forwarding the indi viduals to Hodeida, as was requested by Ali Zamoor Pasha.' On the 27th May, 1866, a new Firman was addressed by the Sultan to the Viceroy of Egypt, modifying the order of succession, in which the following passage occurred :— ' J'ai decide que dorenavant le Gouvernement de 1'Egypte, avec les territoires qui y sont annexes et qui en dependent, et avec les Caimacamies de Se'vakin et de Moussawa, sera transmis ^ I'aine de tes enfants males, et de la meme maniere aux fils aines de tes successeurs.' It will be observed that nothing more is said herein about any {f Dependenciesbut on June 8, 1873, a new Firman was issued, in which it was said— 'J'ai voulu etablir et j'etablis comme loi de52 succession au Khedivat d'Egypte et Je ses depen- dances, ainsi que des Caimacamats de Souahin et de Massowa avec leurs dependances, passera a ton fils, et apres lui, conformement &amp; la loi de primo geniture, de aux fils ain^s ceux qui seront Khedives.' What those dependencies were, are not defined ; but, previous to the issue of the Firman of 1873 (that is in 1870), an Egyptian Governor was appointed over the coast from Suez to Cape Guardafui. The Turkish Government upon this were re- To Lord Lyons, No. 31 ; quested to give to its authorities such instructions Au g ust 1866. as would secure native boats trading between the Lo ri L&gt; o 0 c ns ',^' 312 ' . &amp; May 25, 1866. African Coast and Aden from future molestation. ^ T , T v , , To Lord Lyons, No. *51; Colonel Mere wether had recommended that the December 9, 1866. Turkish Government should be called upon to ' desire their authorities ' to abstain from interfering with places outside the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeh, except Zeyla and Tadjurah, but Her Majesty's Government did not concur in this suo-gestion. In July 1867, the Cabinet resolved to send an Expedition to Abyssinia to enforce the release of 19th and 20th August, 1867, the British captives, and as it was believed that it would be necessary for the troops to pass through Ottoman or Egyptian territory, facilities were asked September 3, 1867. for that purpose from Turkey and Egypt. The Porte at first asked for the territories to be distinctly specified beforehand ; but this was not pressed, and October 3, 1867. eventually the necessary facilities were granted by the Viceroy of Egypt, and the Sultan granted permission for British troops to pass through the &lt;tf Ottoman Empire.' The Expeditionary force landed at Mulkutto near Zeyla, in Annesley Bay. It was reported in the early part of the year Sir ^ P a g et 'No. 50; ^ ^ r J March 2, 1870 (March 1870) that the Italian Government had an intention of establishing a penal settlement on the Coast of Abyssinia; but it was denied by that Government. It was, however, stated that an Italian Company intended running a line of steamers from Genoa through the Suez Canal to India, China, &amp;c.; that it was desirous of establish ing a coal depot somewhere on the western coast of the Red Sea; and that an Italian frigate, which was then at Alexandria, would possibly lend assis tance to the Company in the object they had in view ; but in July a telegram was published stating No. 7, July H, 1870. that—© ■ 0 l ...» / ) V i.' * .-.iV.-. , ■\' * Sir H. Elliot, No. 105; January 12, 1870. I { 4' 53 A corps of Egyptian troops had disembarked in Assab Bay, Italian property in the Red Sea : that after a conflict the Italian flag had been struck down and that the troops had taken possession of this territory;' when the following explanation, apparently bearing an official character, appeared, stating how the territory at Assab was acquired by the Rubattino Steam Packet Company :— u It is known that the Company of Rubattino, some months ago, acquired some property at Assab, a place on the African coast of the Red Sea, from the natives to whom it belonged, and there founded a depot for the purpose of facilitating Italian commerce between Europe and the extreme East. Whether Assab belongs to the Ottoman Dominions or is comprehended in the Caimacamia of Massowah, the administration of which was ceded, by a Firman in 1866, by the Porte to the present Khedive for life, is a question which does not appear to have yet been clearly made out, and which in any case could have no bearing upon the validity of the purchase of the ground, which was a private affair of the Rubattino Company. This is the point which is at present debated at Florence, Constantinople, and Cairo with those forms of reciprocal courtesy which are usual between friendly Gouernments. 'The 'Kartoum,' the Egyptian ship to which the telegram attributes a secret mission, arrived within the last few days, at Suez, and did not, as the telegram stated, leave that port. ' It had returned from Assab, whither it appears to have been sent to obtain exact information as to the nature of the Italian establishment there. That such was the only object of the ' Kartoum,' appears from the positive assurances which are said to have been given to the King's Agent and Consul- General in Egypt. 'It appears that, on disembarking at Assab, where they found the Rubattino establishment quite deserted, the crew of the Egyptian vessel thought they might illtreat the natives of the coast, and entered the uninhabited hut, which is at present the only indication of the Rubattino establishment.' The explanation given of the affair by the Khedive was, that about two months previous to the event in question, persons representing an Italian Company had paid money to an individual who had no right [201] P 2-954 % to it (sic) nor the right of selling it; and that they were informed by the Egyptian Government that they could not be allowed to take possession of it; but that no collision could have taken place, as reported, as there was no Egyptian vessel of war near the place where it was stated to have occurred. In June 1870 an Egyptian ship of war visited Colonel Stanton, No. 60; the ports of Berbera and Belgar on the Somali June 3 ' I870 ' coast, upon which the Commandant of Aden wrote to the Egyptian Commander to ascertain the object Memorandum on Turkish claims to ' . . . , . . iiiii • Sovereierntv over the Soumali terri- of his visit, and to inquire whether he had any views t of conquest over the territory in question. To this inquiry the Egyptian Commander appears to have replied that tjie territory (viz., Berbera and Belgar) belonged formerly to the Sultan ; that it had recently been ceded to the Khedive of Egypt, and that there fore there could be no question of conquest. The Commandant of Aden rejoined that the British had had possession of Aden for thirty years ; but that he had never before heard of the Soumalis being subjects of the Sultan, but on the contrary that they had always been independent. Upon this the Egyptian Commander and the Governor of Aden determined to refer the point in dispute to their respective Governments and await further orders. The conduct of the Egyptian Commander has been approved by the Kfiedive; but before offering an opinion. Lord Granville stated that he would rather wait for further information on the subject (which was promised), and his Lordship asked to be furnished with distinct evidence to show that the British Government were entitled to protest against the Viceroy taking Berbera, or seeking to rule it in the name of the Sultan, as well as for insisting on the independence of the tribes; for be considered that although it might be convenient to Aden that tbe Turks should not hold sway in Berbera, that would. scarcely be a sufficient reason for disputing their right to do so. The next thing heard was that the Viceroy of Egypt had appointed Momtaz Pasha Governor of all the African coast from Suez to Cape Guardafui, including Bulbar and Berbera. Upon making this announcement the Political Agent observed that Momtaz Pasha had previously been Bey at Suakin, and was said to be enlightened, and to have somei 55 India Office, November 1870.

To return now to the question of Aden and the Yemen, and here it should be borne in mind that the province of the Yemen extends from below Jeddah southwards to the Straits of Babelmandeb, and is not confined to the south-eastern corner of Arabia below Senna, as would appear from the map which is often used, but which was prepared in 1839 merely for the purpose of showing the situation of the tribes in the neighbourhood of Aden with whom the British Government have concluded Treaties of protection. The Memorandum drawn up by the Jate Mr. Spring Rice, and recently printed, ended with the events of 1841. What passed between that date and 1865 is alluded to passim in this Memorandum, and it will, therefore, only be necessary to allude to the events which have taken place since the latter date. In March 1866 certain military operations were undertaken by the Aden authorities against the town of Shugra, the sea-port of the Sultan of the Faudtheli (Fouthelee) Tribe, situated about sixty miles from Aden. These operations were perfectly successful. The town, as well as a large village, about two and a-half miles in the interior, as well as a large buggaloe, were destroyed, and the chiefs then made their submission. In May 1867 the Emir of the Azens broke out in open insurrection against the Porte and re- occupied the provinces from which he had been forcibly expelled. The Ottoman forces retired without being able to offer any serious opposition. The Wahabee Sultan also assumed a threatening aspect towards the Porte; but these disturbances were put down by troops sent by the Viceroy of Egypt. About November 1870 disturbances occurred in the Hedjaz, and the Emir of the Azens again re volted against the Sultan ; but, instead of leaving the matter to be dealt with by the Viceroy of Egypt (as in 1867) the Porte preferred to take the matter in hand itself, as it distrusted the Viceroy, and a / V w lo56 force of 15,000 was sent to the disturbed district. This act greatly displeased the Viceroy. The Azens attacked Hodeida, but were repulsed Mr. Stanton. No. 135; by the Turkish garrison, and the insurgents were I)ecember 22 ' 1870 - discomforted by the troops on the spot before the arrival of the expeditionary army, but it, neverthe less, proceeded to its destination, in order to com plete the submission of the revolted tribes. In February 1872 a large Turkish force landed at Sir H. Elliot, No. 372; Hodeida with the intention of marching against „ D T e r ce ^ er 2 ^' 1870 ' o T ^ ^ ^ , Sir H - Elliot ' No - 384 ? benna, and of inducing the Chiefs in these parts of December 28, 1870. Arabia to hoist the Turkish flag. On the 24th April they captured Senna, which was followed by over tures being made by the Turkish authorities to the Chiefs round Aden; and an account of what has passed since that dale is given in Lord Tenterden's Tenterden's Memorandum, Memorandum of November 1873, annexed. November 1873. Before closing this Memorandum it is necessary to say a few words about ' Sheikh Said.' In January 1869, two Frenchmen (MM. Mass India 0fSce; March 7; , 870 and Poilex) purchased of the Shaikh of the Hakur- nee tribe for 80,000 dollars a place called Sheikh Seyd Bunder (or Thoorbo), commonly called ^prifn^'i^O. 3 'Sheikh Said,' for the purpose of establishing a Lord Lyons, No. 223; factory there. The situation of this place is exactly ^ tlI,e ^ 1870 ' opposite to Perim, and the cession included the Cape of Bab-el-Mandeb, and the coast to some dis tance on either side. It was stated by Subadar Ranoo Jaslou, then commanding at Perim, to be ' under the Turkish Government,' and the Acting Political Resident at Aden also reported that ' the Turkish Government had forbidden the sale; that they had censured the Sheikh Ali Tabat, and had moreover represented to the French Government that the transaction was illegal and remonstrated against it; the Sheikh Ali Tabat expressed his great astonishment at hearing of this claim on the part of the Turks, as he stated, ' that the territory had never been governed by any one but himself and his ancestors.' The purchase was made about September 1869, by a French Company for com mercial purposes, and in a French Paper published on the subject it was stated that although the Company was ready ' to admit the validity of the opposition of the Porte with reference to suzerainty, still it maintained that it was no less incontestable that the proprietary rights of the Sheikh could not be disputed.'57 Mr. Barron, No. 42 ; March 28, 1870. Lord Lyons, No. 266; March 29, 1870. Mr. Barron, No. 39 ; April 11, 1870. Sir H. Elliot, No. 16 May 1, 1870. No. 82, June 22, 1870. No. 703, July 8, 1870. The Sheikb Ali Tabit, however, assured the Governor of Hodeida in writing, that the bargain was at an end, in consequence of the purchase-money not having been paid. It was reported that the scheme for this new commercial Company was under the protection of the Turkish Government; that the Messagerie Impe- riale Company had undertaken to purchase land of the Company, and to construct works upon it; and that the French Government, although they had given out that they would not support the scheme, had promised to keep men-of-war always stationed at the Settlement. Mr. Barron was accordingly instructed to ascer tain what the Porte was doing in the matter. Lord Clarendon informed Mr. Barron that ' the Sultan was the real Sovereign over the district' (although a portion of it was outside the Straits of Bab-el- Mandeb); but he nevertheless instructed him to tell the Porte confidentially, that the British Govern ment would deprecate the establishment of a foreign Settlement in the immediate vicinity of Aden. The Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs, how ever, assured Mr. Barron that the scheme was not in any way under the protection of the Turkish Government ; and he added that the French Government had disclaimed all knowledge of the transaction ; that the Sheikh had no right whatever to sell the territory; and that it was the intention of the Porte to send a flotilla of two or three small vessels to the Red Sea with a view of pre venting similar encroachments. Nevertheless it was reported in the following month that the same French Company had defi nitely purchased the territory called ' Sheik Said ; ' but the harbour was found to be too shallow to be serviceable, and it was believed that the scheme would be abandoned ; although M. Aubert, Secre tary of the French Embassy at Constantinople, stated to Lord Lyons in course of conversation, that u the affair of Sheik Said was a pending questionand he argued that the sovereignty of the Sultan over these remote regions was far from being established, and, at all events, that the European guarantee of the integrity of the Ottoman Empire could not be held to extend indefinitely in directions in which the frontier was npt distinctly mentioned. Still the Porte continued to deny the right of [201] Q58 any one to alienate the land in question to a foreign State, and proposed either to refund the money that had been paid for it, or to allow it to be used as a station or dep6t for French commerce without its being withdrawn from the Sultan's jurisdiction. In December 1871 it was publicly reported that India Office, the French had finally abandoned Sheikh Said; whereupon the French Consular Agent at Aden wrote a letter to the British Agent at Aden, in which he said ' the French, or, to speak more cor rectly, MM. C. et A. Bazier et Raband, Freres, of Marseilles, have in no way renounced their estab lishment of Sheikh Saeed, which remains, as here tofore, their property absolutely. Only, as it is necessary that the question between the said mer cantile house and the Government of His Majesty the Sultan should be treated in a diplomatic way, and as the status quo has been agreed to by both Parties, with a view to this, the personnel has been provisionally recalled home, in order to avoid useless expense.' ' But,' he added, ' the rights to us French of this territory could not be discussed otherwise than favourably by the English press, seeing that they are founded, so far as regards Turkey, on the same bases as the Residencies of Aden and Perim, formerly the property of independent Chiefs, in spite of all pretensions to the contrary.' In the following month the Turkish Governor of Hodeida was reported to have written to the French Consular Agent at Aden re-asserting the claims of the Porte upon the territory of Sheikh Saeed, and apprising him that formal possession of it would shortly be taken. It may now be useful to summarize the following facts:— That the French have repeatedly endeavoured to establish a footing on the western shores of the Red Sea at Disseh, at Amphylla, at Edd, at Obokh, and elsewhere, but hitherto without success. That the French have acknowledged the sovereignty of the Sultan over Zeyla by appealing to him against the conduct of the Ruler of that place in the case of M. Lambert. That the Turks have, so recently as 1862, hoisted their flag at Disseh, Adoolis, and Edd. That the Italians endeavoured, some few yearsCaptain Mackenzie, July 4, 1837. May 15, 1844. Colonel Stanton, No. 60 ; June 3, 1870. 59 back, to establish themselves at Assab Bay, but without success. That in 1835, before the opening of the Suez Canal, the Americans attempted to found an agency or factory on the south coast of Arabia, which they visited in two ships of war. That since January 1838 the English have estab lished themselves at Aden,and on the Island of Perim; that they have concluded Treaties with numerous tribes in the Yemen, thereby acknowledging their separate independence; that they have also con cluded Treaties with the Chiefs of Zeyla, Tadjurah, and Berbereb, thereby* acknowledging the inde pendence of these Rulers. That the English have also acquired the Islands of Mussa and Aybad by cession from the Chiefs of Zeyla and Tadjurah, although it is true they have never occupied them. That the British Government have refused to acknowledge the Sultan's claim to any part of Arabia outside the Straits of Babelmandeb. That in 1839 Lord Palmerston declared that the Sultan had no right whatever over the country governed by the Chiefs of the Interior of Arabia. That the British Government have never recog nized the claim put forward by the Viceroy of Egypt to any portion of the African coast outside the same Straits, even as far as Zeyla, much less as far as Cape Guardafui, which is probably only a step to a claim over the whole of the Somali Coast as far as Ras el Khyle, if not further. That the Queen's Advocate reported some few years back that, with regard to the Somali Coast (which would include Berbereb), the fact of the Sultan's laying claim to it could hardly be considered sufficient to justify his right of sovereignty over the territory; that there was nothing to show that he had ever occupied any portion of the territory by his troops; nor was there any proof that the various Chiefs paid him tribute, (although this is now denied by the Egyptian Government), but on the contrary, it would appear from accounts of those who had visited the country that these Chiefs considered themselves independent and recognized no other sovereign Ruler over them. That Berbereh has always been considered by60 the authorities of Aden as independent of either Turkish or Egyptian authority ; and, lastly, That it is very important to Aden that nothing should be done to deter the Berbereh people from bringing their live-stock or other goods to that fortress. The present state of the case stands thus. The Turks lay claim to the whole of Arabia, and the Egyptians lay claim to. the African coast from Suez to Cape Guardafui, and they accordingly ask the British Government to give up the islands (Mussa and Aybad) which were beded by the Chiefs of Zeyla and Tadjurah in 1842, whereby they hope to induce the French to give up their claim to Obokh, which they have never occupied. In considering, therefore, the interests involved in these questions, it should be borne in mind that they are not only Political and Commercial, but are very closely connected with the question of the suppression of the Slave Trade. With regard to the first question the following points have to be considered :— 1. Whether it would be more for the interests of this country that Turkey and Egypt should between them possess the absolute sovereignty over the whole of Arabia and the east coast of Africa inside and outside the Red Sea, than that France, Germany, or any nation should obtain a footing in this portion of the globe. With regard to Arabia, the view taken by the India Office remains unaltered. The Sultan's rio-ht o to certain ports along the coast is not called in question, but that he has any rights in that part of the world which would entitle him to interfere in the internal affairs of the various chiefs around Aden with whom the British Government have concluded engagements, is distinctly denied. Musurus Pasha, in his note of the 28th January last, claims for the Sultan not only the sovereignty over the Yemen, including Lahej, and the other provinces of Arabia by right of conquest, but also over the Arabian Peninsula, as successor of the Prophet and the Chief of the universal Caliphat, but it is well known that, beyond certain towns and districts bordering on the coast, the Sultan has no title whatever to the vast territory in the interior * } February 10,1874.33 of Arabia either by occupation or priority of dis covery, or even by settlement; and it has already been shown that, if the Caliphah claim were to be listened to for one moment as conferring any right of sovereignty, it would include nearly half the world, whilst the Pope, on the same ground, could clMm a large portion of the remaining half. With regard to the western shores of the Red Sea, it may be stated that, practically, the African coast lands belong to the various native tribes which inhabited them, and who have ever claimed their independence; though, from their defenceless state, as well as that of their country, they have to acknowledge the supremacy of either the Turks or Egyptians on the coast, or the Abyssinians and others inland, according as one or other have the power of coercing them. The question of Berbereh stands thus:— Report, September 1, 1873. In the autumn of 1873, the commander of Her See India Office letter of October 6, Majesty's ship ' Dalhousie ' visited Berbereh, and l8/3 ° found there the Egyptian corvette ' Arkha ' carry ing four 70 - pounder Armstrong guns. The Dalhousie ' was at once boarded by an Egyptian officer, who offered assistance to the Commander of 7 i the ' Dalhousie ' as if the territory belonged to the Egyptians. The ' Arkha ' had then been some twenty days at Berbereh, having sailed from Massowah, and having visitfed all Turkish and Egyptian ports, in cluding Annesley Bay, and Zeila on his way. The 'Arkha,' it was stated, held daily com munication with the shore, landing about fifty men, all of whom returned before sunset. The Egyptian flag was flying on shore, and it was believed that the Commander of the &lt;s Arkha ' was awaiting the arrival of the Azul Ahmed tribe, who owned Berbereh, to negotiate with them, concerning the port and country. Other Egyptian vessels and baggalows were ex pected, and the Commander of Her Majesty's ship ' Dalhousie ' stated that there was no doubt that the Egyptian Government looked on Berbereh the same as on Massowah, as part of their territory. Thd Governor of Aden drew the attention of the India Office to these facts, but observed that the injury that might follow to the British position in Aden from the permanent occupation by the Turks [201] R62 or Egyptians of Berbereh and other parts on the African coast outside the Red Sea, had been so fully reported on by former Residents, that he had nothing to add on that subject. The immediate effect of the visit of the Egyptians to Berbereh was to raise the price of provisions considerably, and it was feared that the supplies for Aden might be sensibly diminished ; such, however, was not found to be the case. The Assistant Resident at Aden, Captain Hunter, India Office, November 26, 1873; also visited Berbereh in the ' Dalhousie ' in October last. He found there the Egyptian corvette &lt;£ Surka' six guns, the Sub-Officer of which visited Her Majesty's ship, and inquired the object of his visit, to which Captain Hunter replied, that he had been deputed by the Resident to visit some of the African ports and had accordingly looked in at Berbereh. The Egyptian officer then informed Captain Hunter that he had been settling disputes between the native tribes, that he expected Egyptian troops to arrive at Berbereh shortly, to remain as a per manent garrison. Captain Hunter, however, observed that it was reported that the Somalis were beginning to find the Egyptian yoke galling, and that unless troops were stationed at Berbereh, the Khedive's authority would be but nominal, and in any case confined to the place itself. As to the flag. Captain Hunter remarked that many Mahomedan wild tribes merely looked on it as the standard of Islam, and not as conveying more than an acknowledgment of the religious supre macy of the Sultan of Turkey; adding that it did not seem to determine absolute allegiance. 2. With regard to the second question—Com merce, it was suggested by Mr. Salt in 1810 that an advantageous trade might be carried out with the Abyssinians if they had only an outlet for their commerce on the coast; and the natives of the Somali country are essentially commercial, but they B urton p 30 have lapsed into barbarism by reason of their political condition. Sir Bartle Frere expressed an opinion in 1873 Ma y 29 1873 p 241 that much good would result directly and indirectly 1843 &gt; Burton, p. 35. r u . . , • ^ -.11 1873, Board of Trade, irom cultivating a better acquaintance with the Somali tribes on the coast between Zeyla and Brava, for that they had shown considerable aptitude63 for commerce, as well as for pastoral pursuits; and that, if this was not done, the tendency to become a negro slave-buying and slave-holding people would rapidly increase. But it should be mentioned to their credit, that there are two recent instances on record in which British ships have been stranded on their coast without being molested by the natives, but, on the contrary, meeting with kind treatment at their hands. 3. And, lastly, with regard to the Slave Trade. Berbereh, Zeilah, and Tadjurah are the chief ports outside the Straits of Babelmandeb; and Massowah and Suakin are the chief ports within the Red Sea from which slaves are exported. It sllould not, however, be forgotten that the Chiefs of Berbereh have concluded Treaties with this country (in 1827 and 1856), by which they have engaged to suppress the Slave Trade, and to receive a British Resident. Page 239 of Confidential Paper of In alluding to this subject, Sir B. Frere, in his May 29, 1873. report of the 29th May, 1873, said :— ' Besides the slaves thus brought to Egypt there is a large and increasing trade through the Red Sea ports. Some are brought to Massowah occasionally from the upper affluents of the Nile, and some times by sea from the south. From Massowah and its neighbourhood they are sent, as opportunity offers, northwards to Lower Egypt, Turkey, &amp;c., or across the Red Sea to the Hedjaz and Yemen. ' The southern ports, including those just outside the Straits of Babel-Mandeb, the Somali ports of Zeila, Tajura, &amp;c., which were formerly compara tively free from the Slave Trade, and with the rulers of which we have agreements binding them not to engage in the trade, have of late years become regular and considerable slave-marts, to a degree which renders them impatient of the presence of travellers whom they believe to be likely to denounce the Slave Trade to the British authorities at Aden.' He then stated that previously Zeyla and Tadjurah May 29, P 1873. were regularly visited by the cruizers of the Indian navy and that the agreements of the chiefs to abstain from Slave Trade were then fairly expressed; but that, since the abolition of the Indian navy, this duty had been imperfectly performed, and the use of the Ottoman flag had afforded the Chief of Zeyla and his people facilities for evading examination ; and [201] S64 he added that if our men-of-war more frequently visited Massowahj Suakin, Zeyla, Tadjourah, and the other ports on that coast, he had no doubt that an appreciable effect might soon be produced in check ing the Slave Trade in the Red Sea and its neigh bourhood. In another report, Sir B. Frere said, in speaking January of the Turkish proceedings in Arabia, that he felt assured that a Turkish occupation of the Arabian coast would thwart our anti-slavery policy, by affording the protection of the Ottoman flag to maritime tribes engaged in the Slave traffic.' And as the former of these questions so nearly affects Aden, the warning recently given by Sir Bartle Frere should not be forgotten. He said in his letter of the 10th Januarv, 1873:— 'It is no exaggeration to say that the whole commercial and civilized world trading to the East and Australia is interested in the maintenance of Aden in its present condition.'
