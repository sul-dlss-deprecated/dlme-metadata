V 10 '9» 4^9. ig) miOKaNDUM ;- I submit herewith for your inspection a sample of English Beet Sugar, Java Sugar, and Russian Beet Sugar. The Java sugar is a good staple quality, end is a commodity which has been regularly imported into Bahrain for many years, chiefly by Hindu merchants, in bags weighing about £E8 lbs gross. ^ - i,v^ The Russian beet sugar approximates tq the Java sugar very closely, though it is a little more bluish 1 in appearance, and possibly not quite so sweet. Yet it would be very difficult for an ordinary retail purchaser to distinguish between them. This sugar hascome forward in bags weighing about 226 lbs gross, and is perhaps a little cheaper than Java sugar The English beet sugar can be readily distinguished, as it appears whiter, i.e, purer, than Java or Russian; it is perhaps a little sweeter than these two kinds, and there is very little difference in the cost of them. If the English beet sugar were Ireely imported here, I believe that it would slowly become very popular; but it happens to be very badly packed in thin gunnies which do not bear rough handling, and ieak, with a consequent loss to the importer; hence it is unlikely that much English beet sugar will come to Bahrain. Could the attention of the Board of Overseas Trade be drawn to this point, please ? The Russian beet sugar is a novelty in Bahrain, only one import of fifty bags having come forward, and that in the past week. It was despatched hither from Karachi by Messrs Assanmal Tickamdas to Mr Dewanmal Permanand here. Enclos:- VlKECTQ&amp;^&amp;r CUSTOMS, and PORT OFFICER.

BAHRAIN.Sir, I am directed by His MaJesty T s Conaul-General and Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to inform you that the local manager of Messrs. Ziegler &amp; Company of Manchester, who is interested in trade prospects in Bahrain, is anxious to obtain information on the following points 1. Sugar. If Tate T 3 'British Granulated' brand of sugar is marketed in Bahrain and if so, is it imported direct from the United Kingdom or throu^i the medium of Indian traders in Bombay ? 2,Cotton Piece Goods . Information regarding any direct trade which may exist between Bahrain and Lancashire and, if possible, a range of samples covering the cloths most in favour in Bahrain at present. 2. Cotton Thread. Is there a market in Bahrain for sewing, shoemakers, or other thread ? 4• Exports from Bahrain. Any information you may be able to give in this connection. Messrs. Ziegler &amp;. ^orQpB,ny are specially interested in Gum Tragacanth and Gum Arabic and would like to know if these commodities are available for export from Bahrain and in what I have furnished Ivlr.

Sir, I have the honoar to refer to your letter No#2393 dated the 18th November 1933 regarding certain information asked for by the local ! anager of Messrs Ziegler and Company of Manchester, 2. My enquiries showj- (a) that no Gum Tragacanth or ofum Arabic passes through Bahrain (b) that there is unlikely to oe any market in Bahrain for English Sewing, shoemakers or other thread. Requirements are supplied from India and only cheap lines are brought, and (c) that Cotton Piece Goods from Lancashire are being replaced by Japanese goods, because of the cheap price and closer attention to the needs of the market. Indian and other merchants import direct what Lancashire goods are required. 3. I am prepared to obtain a range of samples if f'essrs Ziegler and Company desire to pursue the matter, but I fear that they would be unable to secure much, if any, trade under present circumstances. Much of the trade used to be in the hands of another British firm who have since lost it owing to tae close competition of local merchants. 4.- w- - 2 - 4« I am making certain enquiries about Tate 's 'British Granulated' sugar, which may prove helpful, I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant. ^0 4/ Lieut-Colonel,\ oliticaT.

There is no regular importer of this commodity, and it was found that the last import did not compete with the Java sugar, which has become cheaper than before. The reason why the last import of Russian beet sugar was packed in trbble gunny bags was that originally it was packed in a single gunny, but this proved to be so unsatisfactory in texture that two more gunnies were added to protect the sugar. It is quite possible than if the second gunny had been made of stronger material, there would have been only two gunny covers, similar to other packings.

It was pointed out to me that the sugar leaks out of single bags owing to routfi handling by the stevedore! who also uee hooks to move oargo.

To obviate this leakage British ouppllero wist do as their foreign eompetltors do and paok the su^ar in double be jr. The two ohlef su^jar Importers in Bahrain and mUBJLS JABVlkL would w^ioome the opportunity of linportlui; British beet sugar packed In the atove mentioned way and lntej:«fJt«d British firms should make offers to thetb. 'me present souroes of supply are Java 9 which sends oane sugar t and Angary and Belgium whloh eend beet sugar. A small quantity of beet sugar used to be luported from ngland* he ere•test proportion of sugar Imported Is Java oane sugar. It It a little more expensive than beet sugar but this disad vantage Is more or less offsst by the faot that it Is slightly * tndn the beet sugar and therefore more economical to use. *•/4v 2. 4» iresea^ prloes of imported sa^ar are at follows j- Jara oana Kr 12.0.0. p«r bag of 2 Cwts. -iuncarlaa beat Rs ll.e.o. per bag of 2 Cwts.

It will therefore be seen that Imports of British sugar whloh totalled 14,700 Hundred-weights in 19^2-^ have now eompleteljr disappeared from the marlcet. In order to remedy t v is state of affairs British firms should adopt the eorreot method of paoking besides Jcecpiag prices down. 7. It Is regrettable that British sugsr exporters who seewid likely a few years ago to obtain a secure footlni In this market hare not been able to maintain their position. There is no reason why 1 ritish suppliers should not oapture an over luoreaslng share of the trade in this market. They could do so if they showed energy and determination coupled with a readl- aese to confirm to standard practice. 8.

My dear Loch, Thank you very much for your letter, L.0.1973, of the 28th September, with enclosures, on the subject a market for iJnited Kingdom sugar in the Persian Gulf. It is very kind of you to have supplied me with these details which I have read with the greatest interest. # I understand that the present position is that sugar for the Persian Gulf passes chiefly through the hands of Messrs. C. Czarnikow Ltd., the well-known sugar brokers in Mincing Lane. These supplies emanate from various sources, including the United Kingdom. As things are at present I am advised that it would not be possible for the British Sugar Corporation to compete in this market. The whole of our output at present is consumed in the United Kingdom and as beet sugar is a preferential sugar it suffers from competition with foreign sugar on account of the fact that it has only a small drawback. I am very grateful to you for bringing this matter to my noxice, and I shall keep it under observation so that we may try to enter your field later if opportunity offers. Yours sincerely.No - 3042-10/21.

The British Agent was keen to promote imports of British sugar beet into Bahrain in the face of foreign competition, particularly from Japan. The file includes a letter from the Political Agent (Percy Gordon Loch) to the Political Resident (Trenchard Craven William Fowle) summarising the position of British beet sugar in relation to its two competitors, Java cane sugar, and Russian beet sugar, which notes that British sugar leaked from the bags and was more subject to deterioration from the dampness of the climate, 8 April 1934; a memorandum by the Vice-Consul, Bushire (Frank H Todd), on the import of British sugar into Bahrain, with covering letter from the Political Resident to the Department of Overseas Trade, London, which recommends improvements to the ways in which British sugar was bagged, 31 December 1935; and correspondence between the Political Resident and the British Sugar Corporation Limited, 1936, in which the Chairman of the British Sugar Corporation states that it was not possible for his company to compete in the Bahrain market, as the whole of the company's output was consumed in the United Kingdom market, and beet sugar suffered from competition with foreign sugar.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Bahrain Political Agency</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">creator</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Sir Knight Charles Dalrymple Belgrave</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>Trade (practice)</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00005c#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
