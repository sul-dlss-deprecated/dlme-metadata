New Delhi, 2nd September 44 daneral Headqnartorj here- recently sent a Lieut.-Colonel daniber to eoe mo xn choo v/e could make use of his services# *9 is a first class interpreter in Russian and is married to . a Russian wife# There must oo a good deal about him on record m she embassy as he \7as employed in hashed ss Liilitary Attache Daly was there. There is no scope for Russian experts m or near about India as the v»ar in that direction is off the map, out it occurred to me that you might wish to know of any British officer who can be called a Russian expert, and I ym therefore writing you this letter. I enclose an ex ract o: ; lumber ’3 services. The fact that ho was in Meshed before might of course militate against his employment in Persia now. 2. da hove only two poste in which knowledge of Russian is of real importance and those are at Meshed and in Kashgar, and there is no prospect of either of these being vacant in the r, ear future. In uny case I do not think Domber would be a possible person to send to Meshed. His age is incidentally just od, I should add that the Commander-In-Chief has no objection to Hamber’s release from military service if his services are required in any other capacity. I am sending ^bopy of this letter to Peel in case Foreign Office would be interested to know of Hamber.
