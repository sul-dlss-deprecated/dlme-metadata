I need hardly say tnat Shaikh F.halaf requires no introauction to this Agency. 3. Since they must have seen from his petition,which is mentioned in the letter of introduction that there was evidently a bar to his return they should not have taken action without receiving a reply and i would be glad if the attention of His Excellency tiie High Commissioner could be drawnIt I drawn to this, Uafort^ately I cannot trace ai^'' letter to the Baghcaa Residency re jesting- them not to ^ive him papers to return at the time of his deportation four yesrs ago,but I believe that Captain Aiban was here then ana may remember what information was given them. It is clear,however,that 7ing Faisal wrote to Shaikh Hamad asking that Lhaikh Khalaf might be allowed to return, and tnat Shaikh Hamad refused tne request. 4. Shaikh Khalaf is a troublesome personage ana his unexpected returu hos n :*iae the Agency and .Shaikh Hamad look foolish,and ma/ h ^ve serious results, i took the precaution, however,of sending for him after his arrival and telling him tnat though the Government had conaonou his offence in returning without permission,and were prepared to allow nim three months lo settle up his affairs, yet if any disturbance resultec from his return he would be required to return to 'Ir&amp;q by the first steamer, ilo disclaimed all intention or desire to cause truuble and said thai axl he wished to ao was to settle uo his affcirs and return m six weeks or two montns Let us hope that this is so.

April 1931 from the High Commissioner for 'Iraq., regarding Shaikh Khallaf's return to Bahrajn, which speaks for itself. I am to request that you^be so good as to explain the circumstances of the case to Eis Ex- -cellenc.y the Shaikh of Bahrain and convey to him an expression of apology from His Excellency the High Commissioner for 'Iraq for the unfortunate oversight which gave rise to Shaikh Khallaf's return to Bahrain. I have the honour to 'be, Sir, Your most ohedient servant. \/ ^ \'\V -apt., Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.The Residency. Baghdad. 17th. April 1931 No. 3308 s Sir, I have the honour to reply to your dispatch No.163-3 dated the 27th. Karch, 1931, regarding Shaikh Khallaf Shaikh Ahmad al Asfur, the ex-Shiah^of Bahrain. 2. I have made enquiries as you suggest and find that the circumsatnces in which Shaikh Khallaf was given an emergency certificate to enacie liim to proceed to Bahrain are as follows. At the 'beginning of January 1931 Shaikh Khallaf submitted to this High Commission a petition, ol which a translation is enclosed, requesting thau he might he assisted either to api-olntt a fresh agent to look after certain property in Bahrain or to proceed to -Bahrain orderjto sell that property. The petition was forward- -^4 to Kis Majesty's Political Agent, Bahrain, under my Secretariat endorsement No 263 dated the 8th. January,±931 (quoted in the despatch under reply), ^for such action y if any, as he may see fit to take**. Towards the end of February Shaikh Khallaf applied for passport facilities to proceed to Bahrain. He was introduced to my Consular^; Secretary, and very strongly recommended for good offices 'by a local notable of exceptionable reputation and stand- -ing. As he appeared to he a Bahraini hy 'birth (and therefore prima facie entitled to proceed to Bahrain), and as appropriate enquiries and reference to the records produced nothing to his detriment, my Consular Secretary gave him the emergency certificate dated the 4th. Larch under reference, and also, at the request of the local notable already mentioned, a letter of introduction to the Political Agent.3. On the 20th. -^aroh , my Consular Secreoary received from the Political Agent, -Bahrain, his letter No. 345 dated the 14th. March, wherein it was stated with reference to the petition enclosed herewith, that, in view of the disturbances which were associated with the presence of Shaik^Khallaf in Bahrain, Eis Excellency the Huler of Bahrain was not disposed to agree to his return. Having ascertained that Shaikh Khallaf had only recently left Baghdad en route Bahrain , my Gon- -sular Secretary at once s nt to his Majesty•s Consul Basra, the telegram of which a copy is attached; this prove # d however too late to stop Shaikh Khallaf. 4. On receipt of the lolitical Agent's letter dated the 14th, March a further search was made in the High Corm-iissioner archives which lea to the discovery of previous correspondence regarding the objections to Shaikh Khallaf*s return to Bahrain, which pas. ea in November 1928. My Consular Secretary was on leave in No/ember, 1928. When he i ssued the eii.ergency visa under 'iii^ussion he had not seen this correspondence and had no reason to suppose that the presence of Shaikh Khallaf in Bahrain was in any way objectionable. Nor did he expect a reply from the Political Vgent, Bahrain, in re- -gard to Shaikh Khallaf 1 s petition enclosed, oecause the petition appeared to be no more than a request for^assis- -tance to proceed to Bahrain'; but this was taken to mean assistance of a general nature only. The definite application for passport facilities was not made until some weeks later. 5. I should be grateful if an expression of apology might be conveyed to Eis Excellency thtRuler of Bahrain in regard to the incident, with an explanation of the un- -fortunate oversight which gave rise to it. There would of course have been no question of granting passport fa- -cilities to Shaikh Khallaf without reference to the€&gt; Tra splatlon. (Purport of petition) okaikh Khrllaf Shaik Ahmad al 'Asfur. H.E.the High Commissioner for 'loaa. 31st. DecemlDer, 1931. The petitioner who comes from Bahrain states that four years ago he made up his mind to reside at Kadhimain. He previously had an agent at Bahrain who proved dishonest. Ee lately released&gt; that -agent and a^p inted another one to look after his properties. The petitioner requests that the British Resident at Bahrain 'be asked not ^ help the first agent and pre- -vent him from trespassing upon his properties there. He further asks that assistance he rendered to his re- -cently appointed agent in accordance with the letter of appointment he has sent him. If this is not possible the petitioner asks for assistance to preceed to Bahrain for a period of three months in order to sell .his proper ties and settle his accounts.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000193.0x00034f_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/2/112</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x00034f</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/2/112</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 5/22 Sheikh Khalaf'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1928/1931</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2014-03-19T00:13:09</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">ara</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (23 folios)</extent><extent>This file is arranged approximately in chronological order.</extent><extent>Foliation: The main foliation sequence commences at the front cover and terminates at the back cover; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled and can be found in the top right of the recto side of each folio.
