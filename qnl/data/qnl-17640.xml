He reports on his meetings with the chiefs of the coast. Porter relays information obtained from the various chiefs, including news that both Sultan ben Suggur [Sulṭān bin Saqr Āl Qāsimī] and Saaed ben Thanoon [Sheikh Said bin Tahnun Al Nahayan] want the fort at Braimee and that the Braimee people are defending themselves against both parties. Porter concludes by stating that he has enclosed a copy of his instructions to Lieutenant James Tronson and two letters from the Agent at Shargah [Sharjah], Moolah Hussein [Mullah Husain]. These three enclosures are not included. However, Porter's letter is followed by a copy of a letter, no. 12, dated 25 July 1850, from Tronson, Commander of the HC Brig
                           Euphrates, to Porter, which describes Tronson's recent movements, including his meeting with the Sheihk [Sheikh Muhammad bin Khalifah Al-Khalifah] of Bahrein [Bahrain]. Tronson concludes by reporting that a party of slaves (six men and seven women) had come on board the
                           Euphratesthat morning, seeking British protection. Tronson states that he sent them away again, on the grounds that he has received no orders regarding slaves claiming protection.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023711592.0x000006#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
