Sir, With reference to your confidential No»593-S, dated the 2nd June 1953, I have the honour to inform you that the comniunication, which I made to His JSxcellency the Shaikh of Kuwait on 25th January 1953, referred to both (a) the customs (export) duty paid on the produce of his gardens in Ira&lt;3_, exported for his household use in ^uwaifc. and (b) payments of losses resulting from the imposition of the Istihlak Tax on those of his date gardens in Iraq which are covered by the guarantee given by His Majesty's Government in 1914. 2. In order that there should be no misunderstanding however, and in order that the Shaikh may be given no loop hole at a later date to turn round and say that I did not warn him, I meaii would like to place it on record that I mentioned the matter specifically to him on two subsequent occasions also, the last being on 17th June 1933. 3. On each occasion I gave my warning to the Shaikh in verbal conversation , and I impressed on him ^he vital necessity of being most careful to have all his records ready, should they ever be required. 4- The Shaikh, especially on the 17th June, appearedappeared thoroughly to grasp the importance of what I told him, and not only thanked me for my advice, but assured me that full records, such as I mentioned not only existed, but were being kept separate from those which had been kept for his non-guaranteed properties. 4. I think, therefore, we may assume that things are going as we wish in this matter. I have the honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient servant, Lt.-Colonel. Political Agent,Xuwait.

The Shaikhs letter speaks for itself, and is in fact a formal protest to His Majesty's Government against the action of the Iraq Government in collecting Istihlak tax from his gardens in Iraq, which under the guarantee given by His Majesty's Government to his grandfather in ed 1914, were exempt/from all taxation. The Shaikh adds that his agents have on various occasions represented this fact to the tax collectors of Ihe Iraq Government, but without avail, and that in allowing any payment to be made, he ( (the Shaikh) has done under protest , reserving all his rights in the matter.

P.Z.3380/33. n: Confidential 7 QOHflfiEwAt ^uoniRt RESIDENCY, ^ 1 ^til-June 1933. (,lv Hi Dear sir Percy, You will remember that there has heen a great deal of discussion ahout the assurances in respect of their date gardens in Iraq which were given to the Sheikhs of Koweit and Mohainmerah, in return for their assistance at the beginning of the War, in 1914, There has recently been an effort to challenge the title of the Sheikh of Koweit to certain oi/the date gardens possession of which was guaranteed to him in 1914, on the ground that his title was never properly registered. As you will remember, the title was not registered before the War because the Turkish Government would agree to registration only on condition that the Sheikh declared himself a Turkish subject, which, on our advice and at our request, he was unwilling to do. 2. In 1915, Sir Henry Dobbs, as Revenue Commissioner granted the Sheikh of Koweit a taou deed of registration in respect of the property now in dispute. The grant was admittedly not in accordance with the Ottoman la?/, and for this and various other technical reasons it has been argued that the deed of registration was void ab initio . We are inclined to think, however, that if, as we presume was the case, the Revenue Commissioner was authorised to register property in taiou by virtue of one of the proclamations, articles or laws referred to in Part YIII of the IraOj, Constitution, of which I enclose a copy, and if in registering the Sheikh ? s estate he did not act in contravention of or exceed the authority conferred upon him, Major General Sir Percy Cox. GkCJI.G a.ca.E^K.c.s.i., it/ 2b, Kensington Palace Mansions, De Vere Gardens,W # 8,10 it should be possible to defend the legality of the registration. It seems to us possible that in carrying out the registration of this property and others, Sir H« Dobbs was acting under the general authority of some Army proclamation or order which authorised him, in his capacity of Revenue Commissioner, to carry out transactions of this character. We have succeeded in tracing a reference in Army Orders to his appointment (on 26th January 1915) as Revenue Commissioner, but we have been unable (the papers are very confused and there are many gaps in them) to find any corresponding order indicating the nature of the duties which he was to perform in that capacity, I wonder if, by any chance, you remember after this long interval whether there was in fact any formal proclamation or order by the Army Commander specifying the Revenue Commissioner^ duties? If your recollection is that there was we will search again, since if the duties defined included property registration without stipulating that registration must be in accordance with the old Ottoman Law, then it might greatly strengthen our hands in contending that Part VIII of the Iraq Constitution could be considered as validating his registration of the Sheikh f s property, 3- I must apologise for bothering you with a point such as this. I need not say how grateful we shall be for any assistance you may be able to give us. « •• 1 -r* v ' ^ '• ' A ^. //-A* fcf-SII THAQ nnWSTTTTJTION . PACT VII I.

My immedlfte]y preceding telegram (date gardens of Sheikhs of Kowelt and Mohammerah). Plesse obtain as soon as possible best legal advice on three following points; (a) Are we correct in assuming that in Bashiyeh case plaintiff in whose favour judgment has already been given could not in any event proceed to execution until successful suits in respect of balance of garden have beesn brought by remainder of interestea parties? (b) In any case in which juagment is given against him, would Sheikh of Koweit be able to establish case for stay of execution until claim for refund of original purchase money had been heara, and, in the event of such claim being allowed until it had been ascertained that plaintiff was in a position to make necessary refund? This demand could presumably only be made if heirs of vendor, from wnom refund would be claimed, were identical with plaintiffs in the case, or were predecessors in title of the latter, and I shall be glad of information on this point. (c) In Paddaghiyeh case Sheikh is pleading immunity from jurisdiction of Iraqi courts.

In refusing legislation the Irani Qovernment were acting in accordance with the advice of Mr. Drower, British Adviser to the Ministry of Justice, who did not consider that he would be juEtifled in recommending that legislation should be pasoed validating the title of the fihelfch while a suit to deprive him of that title wae already ending.

' i *11 Hsl \ j ^ ' (7/ l_ J 29th June, 1933. ^ _ i OONflfiEITIAl DEOOMi' i Si.,5^ ^ With reference to your confidential despatch No# 640-S of June 10th, regarding the Shaikh of Kuwaiti Fao Estates, I have the honour to enclose a copy of a note 'by my Legal Secretary on the points raised 'by the Shaikh^ lawyer, Mr. Gabriel. 2. With regard to the loss of estates 'by the Sa f duns in the Muntafiq, I am advised that the circumstances obtain ing in those cases differed widely from anything that has occurred during the Shaikh of Kuwait's occupancy of his Fao Estate. The Sa'duns were generally absentee landlords of the worst description and seldom had more than a nominal over- lordship of the lands in question. They had for years 'been unable to collect their share of the revenue from the lands, and their titles were in many cases faulty. They appealed to Government for assistance in obtaining some revenue from the tribesmen in occupation of the lands, and it was necessary to have recourse to a Government Commission to consider the whole problem of their rights in the land. As far as I am av/are, they were not deprived of anything to which they had an effective title. 3, It would seem, therefore, though one would naturally hesitate to advise the Shaikh to disregard the advice of his lawyer, that the Shaikh might be told that the position does not on the face of it seem to be quite so precarious as Mr. /Gabriel The Honourable The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, BUSHIRE.UU 2 Gabriel appears to imagine, and that, 'by waiting for the Land Settlement, which is in progress in parts of 'Iraq and will eventually extend throughout the country, to reach Fao, he would thereby at any rate save himself a great deal of trouble and expense. I have the honour to he Sir Your obedient Servant B,Note 'by Legal Secretary on Lieutenant-Colonel T«C. Fowled confidential despatch No* 640-S of 10th June, 1933, The dangers envisaged 'by Mr. Gabriel are of so hypothetical a nature that it is not easy to advise. Certainly, a Tapu title would 'be a 'better one than reliance upon an Ottoman firman. However, the Shaikh and his dependents have 'been in quiet and uncontested possession of the Fao estates for so long that I cannot see from what quarter a claimant can arise with proof of better title than the Shaikh possesses. Mr. Gabriel himself appears to consider the position safe enough in law. What he apparently fears is a rising of the fellaheen, actively encouraged and supported by the * Iraqi Government. This would be an extra-legal movement, and, if it occurred. His Majesty^ Government would presumably have something to say on the matter. Owing to the system of inheritance operating under Mahomedan law, the preparation of Tapu deeds for this large estate would be a matter of great difficulty. It would result in profit, no doubt, to Mr. Gabriel, but the Shaikh is wise, I think, to hesitate before embarking on it. I think he would be better advised to wait until the comprehensive land settlement, which is now being carried out throughout ^raq., reaches Fao, when, after a careful survey of the land has been made, he should have no difficulty in obtaining complete title deeds from the Settlement Commission. 27.6.33.'

The Shaikh as you know returned from Bahrain yesterday afternoon after a most stormy journey of 4 days. I met him on the jetty (Arab fashion) and called I formally on him this morning. ^ ;/ 3* I was able to discuss your Confidential No. 715-S of 23rd June, but not your Ho.547-S of 25th May - the latter question the Shaikh promised to talk over on Saturday next (8th July). 4 # I come now to the point of this letter. Do you remember the note which I gave you at Bushire (dated 8th June) on the Shaikh of Kuwaits Fao Estates. You sent a copy to Baghdad under your Confidential No.640-S, dated the 10th June. .{ ^ 5. I would ask you in particular to refer to paras 5 to 11 of my note. 6. The Shaikh it seems on his return from Bahrain, was presented with a bunch of letters from his FAC Agent, the gist of which was that the fellaheen of his FAO estates, had started giving serious trouble, and were in fact behaving in exactly the way that I foreshadowed might/ The Hon*ble Lt.—Colonel T.G.W.ITowle, C.B.S., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf,— 2 — might happen in para 6 of my 'Note on the ITao Estates » 7 # According to the Shaikh, his Agent reports the trouble began first in the northern hali of the ?ao property then rapidly spread to the southern half and that at the time of writing the 'bad hats' were rapidly gaining over the faithful few, and persuading them to join in* Many acts of'sabotage' have taken place, such as cutting down trees, etc., and about two thirds of the fellaheen had refused point blank to give the Shaikhs Agent, firewood, palm fronds (saaf), fruit, fodder, etc# etc., which is normally sent to Kuwait at this time of the year, for the use of the Shaikhs household, and which is the Shaikhs absolute right to collect. 8. The fellaheen in other words, had started an intensive 'non-cooperation' campaign, and in reply to the Agents protests appear to have everywhere given the same reply, namely, 'The Iraq G-overnment is our G-overnment, and not the Shaikh of Kuwait, we are the owners of the soil, and have been born and bred on it. Our Government (IRAQ,) is going to help us, and will make us the ' Mallaks ' i / or proprietors instead of the Shaikh of Kuwait. 9 # According to the Shaikh, the Agent further made report that he had gone to the Mudir of ^ao and com plained officially against the fellaheen and their behaviou That the Mudir had sent for the 'Mukhtars' (headmen) and told them they must behave themselves, and pay the Shaikhs share quietly and in orderly manner^ but that so far nothing had happened. 10. The Shaikh, who, I could see, was greatly wor ried and excited about the matter, added that he had just received a telegram from his Agent to the effect that there were signs that the trouble was spreading to his/his faddaghiyeh fellaheen, and asked for orders. 11. The Shaikh gave it as his positive opinion that the Mudir of Fao himself was at the bottom of the trouble, and that he was acting under the secret and ex press orders of the Mutasarrif, Basrah. In other words the prophesy, which Mr.Gabriel made to me,/before I came over to Bushire, appears now to be coming true inevery 4e^a 12. The Shaikh urged me to report the matter to you without delay, remarking, 'This is what I get for being the friend of you 'English 1 13. The Mudir was of course (Turkish fashion) out wardly pretending to help his agent, said the Shaikh, but in reality was himself stirring up his tenants to act as they were doing. 14. Personally in view of what Mr.Gabriel told me at the end of May, and knowing the pleasant methods of the modern Iraqi Officials, I am myself convinced that what the Shaikh has told me is the correct interpretation of the business. It is merely a new form of attack on the part of the IR1Q, Government on the Shaikh of Kuwait. The danger of course lies in its underhandedness. They will, of course, indignantly deny all responsibility and will call for a report. This will, no doubt, show con clusively that the Shaikh of Kuwait has been oppressing his fellaheen for years, and that the poor devils have been driven (to) 'to kick' at last, (the common method adopted in the case of the tt Al Saadun n ) . Government will then deem it right to interfere out of an honest and disinterest ed desire to see justice done to their Iraqi subjects etc etc. and no one can say how the matter will end. just detail.53/11.

'B' is a letter dated 25th June 1933 from Abdullah Beg al Faleh Pasha al Sa'adun (recently released from prison) to myself. 2. Letter 'A n is merely sent you for information. I ao not think there is any need for you to take any action, seeing that Messrs: Gabriel &amp; Co., the Shaikh's lawyers can be trusted to watch matters and give any advice that may be necessary. 3. Letter 'B' is interesting. The Shaikh tells me that he received a very similar letter to mine from Abdul Aziz Beg al Faleh Pasha (brother) but that he is entirely/entirely unaware of any claim having ever existed or having ever been put forward before to any portion of his property by any member of the A1 Sa f adun. 4 # The Shaikh further tells me that Abdul Aziz Beg i al Sa^dun owns the gardens next door to his ITao Estates (immediately on the north side) and he is almost certain that in the same way as his fellaheen on the Fao Estates have been stirred up by some one recently to refuse to pay their rightful dues, (for the first time in their lives), so some one has been arranging for Abdul Aziz Beg to lay a ficticious claim to a portion of his (the Shaikh's) Fao Estates, and that the above letters to me and to him (the Shaikh) are the first move in a new game # 5, Both the Shaikh and I have written friendly replies pointing out that no member of the Al Sa'adun has ever laid claim to any of the Al Subah property be fore, and that if there are any documents, supporting such claims, they should be sent to Kuwait for examination® 6. The Shaikh of course, suspects that the present Mutasarrif of Basrah is behind things and it will be in teresting to see developments. I have the honour to be Sir Your most obedient servant Lt•-Colonel, Political Agent, Kuwaits Translation of a letter dated the 28th Safar 1358 (21.6.33.) from Abdul Aziz as-Salim, Basrah, to His Excellency Shaikh Sir Ahmed al Jabir as-Subah, Ruler of Kuwait. ooo After Compliments, I have to inform you that the documents connected with the (Faddaghiyeh) lawsuit of Abdulla Beg Az Zuhair, against the Shaikh, were called for by the Ministry of Justice, and were passed on to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and lastly they were returned to the Court. In short the British Embassy in Iraq has informed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that the Political Resident in the Persian G-ulf had made excuse that he could not serve the documents on the Ruler of Kuwait. For this reason the papers have returned to the Basrah Courts, and the latter have in consequence postponed proceeding in the case, on the grounds that Your Excellency is in Bahrain. I trust that you will thank the Political Resident for this state of affairs. Apart from the above, I beg to tell you something else. Your adversary*s agent recently took the following action:- He approached Jskander Mansoor (Your Excellency's recently empbyed lawyer), and suggested that he (the lawyer) become a partner in the case. When your adversary's agent learned that a diffi culty had arisen about serving the documents (on you, the Shaikh), he decided as a precaution to attach the produce of the ft Faddaghiyeh n .

Dear Mr. Laithwaite, (Forgive me, if I have not your present mode of address correct. I have no books of reference by me). I have received your confidential letter No, P.2.3380/33 about the Shaikh of r.oweit's date-gardens near Basra. '\ &lt;:i So far ab I remember, there was not issued during my time any order by the Army Commander specifying the Bevenue Commissioner's duties, in fact I think that I was opposed to the issue of any such order at the beginning, since my work then included such a medley of Turkish Departments of which we scarcely knew the names and included the Judicial Department. I do, however, remember distinctly that a special order was issued about the reopening of the Tapu Department, which had been closed, I think, from the beginning of the War until April 1915. If this order cannot be found in the files of orders by. the Army Commander, it is practically certain to have been published in the Basra Times, since I remember that I made special efforts to give the greatest possible publicity to the fact of the reopening. It is possible that this order will be found to include a specification of the powers of the Kevenue Commissioner in relation to Tapu operations. It would of course be a general disaster to the inhabitants of Basra, were the Tapu Powers of the Eevenue Commissioner in 1915 and 1916 now to be successfully challenged, since immense arrears of applications for / &lt; Tapu/1° Tapu Transfers had accumulated under the Turks and I worked them off pretty rapidly, enquiring into and signing some thousands of transfers• Many titles would be invalidated and there would be general discontent, I can hardly believe that the Iraq (government would choose now to adopt such a course.

Dear Sir Henry Dobtis, I hope you will forgive I bother you about a difficult point which has arisen in connection with the assurances in respect of their date gardens in Iraq which were given to the Sheikhs of Koweit and Ivlohanmerah in 1914 v in return for their assistance at the beginning of the War. There has recently been an effort to challenge the title of the Sheikh of Koweit to certain of the date gardens possession of which was guaranteed to him in 1914,on the ground that his title was never properly registered. As you will remember, the title was not registered before the War because the Turkish Government would agree to registration only on condition that the Sheikh declared himself a Turkish subject, which, on our advice and at our request, he was unwilling to do. 2/ Sir Henry Dobbs, GBE., KGSI., KGMG., KCIE. Carnphire, Gappoquin, Go.Waterford.^ 1915 a tanu deed of registration in respect of the property now in aispute was granted to the Sheikh hy you as Revenue Commissioner. The grant was admittedly not in accordance with the Ottoman Law and for this and other various technical reasons it has heen argued that the deed of registration was void ah initio . You may, in this connection, care to see the copy which I enclose of your letter of 14th June 1915 to the Agent of the Sheikh of Koweit. 3. The question is being further Investigated here. We are, however, at this stage inclined to think that if, as we presume was the case, the Revenue Coranissioner was authorised to register property in tapu toy virtue of one of the proclamations, articles or laws referred to in rait VIII of the Iraq Constitution, of which I enclose a copy, and if, in registering the Sheikh's estate he did not act in contravention of or exceed the authority conferred upon him, it should be possible to defend the legality of the registration, it seems to us possible th-^t in carrying out the registration of this property and others your action as Revenue Comnissioner was taken under the general authority of some Army proclamation or order which authorised you in that capacity to carry out transactionstransactions of this character. We have traced a reference in Army Orders (reproduced from the Gazette of India) to your appointment (on 26th January 1915) as Revenue Commissioner, dut we have oeen unahle (the papers doth here and in the historical section of the C.I.D. are very confused and there are many gaps in them) to find any corresponding order indicating the nature of the duties which fell to he performed dy the Revenue Commissioner. 4. If dy any chance you rememher after this long interval whether there was in fact any formal proclamation or order dy the Army Gomtnander specifying the Revenue Commissioner's duties, we should de most grateful if you could let us know. Sir Percy Cox, whom we consulted, tells me that he was not actually in Basra at the time of the appointment of the Revenue Commissioner and that though he has a strong recollection that there was some order of the type In question, he has been unable so far to trace it. sir Arnold Wilson has a very definite recollection that some notification appeared in Porce Orders, but here again, we have not so far succeeded in finding one. If your recollection is that there was any Army proclamation or order defining or referring to the nature/nature of your duties, we will renew our search, since i± tne duties defined included property registration without stipulating that registration must be in accordance with the old Ottoman Law, then it might greatly strengthen our hands in considering that Part VIII of the Iraq constitution could be considered ao validating yoUx registration of the Sheikh 1 s property. b * 1 nee(i no ' t say how grateful we shall he for any assistance you can give us on this rather difficult and controversial point, about viiich I trust you will forgive me for bothering you.

Sir, With reference to my telegram No. 169 dated the 25th July 1935, and previous correspoifdence. 2 # I have the honour to forward translation of a letter No. R/5/1085 dated the 24th July 1933 which I have received from His Excellency the Shaikh. 3 . The Shaikh* s letter gi#fs a fairly clear picture of how the trouble started, and the stiuation at Eao at the time of writing. In an interview which the Shaikh had with me on the same date that the letter was written, he expressed his belief that some person or persons (he hinted strongly that it was the Mutasarrif Basra) had deliberately stirred up his tenants to act as they were doing, for political reasons. 5. The Shaikh added that the ring leaders consisted of three of his fellahs (a) Jassim al Saleh (b) Saleh al Mujalli (c) A third person (name not yet reported) who had managed to get a following of some 300 of his fellaheen, of whom about half were definitely in league with the ring leaders and half were at hert A )-(2)- heart still loyal, but were being compelled to obey the orders of the ring leaders by prooees of victimi zation, etc. Further that the ring leaders mentioned in paragraph 5 above had engaged one Ibrahim Naji a lawyer of Basra to watch their interests, and according to Mr. Gabriel the Shaikh's Basra Lawyer were challenging the Shaikh to try and evict them or force them to pay rental, etc., which in the present case is paid in the form of a recognized share on all dates, palmxrfronds, fruit, vegetables, lucerne grass, etc., etc., which are grown on the property. The Shaikh added that according to Mr. Gabriel, should he (the Shaikh) attempt to take the case to the Basra Courts, which is what the fellaheen evidently wanted him to do, the defence would plead ' Denial th at he (the Shaikh) was the, rightful landlord, and he w ould be asked to prove his right in 'Tanu'. le -- nroduoe Tapu papers'. These, as has been reported elsewhere, the Shaikh does not possess. A long legal case would then result, and there is no knowing how matters would turn out in view of the Iraq Government's present attitude. 8 For the above reasons both the Shaikh and his Lawyer Mr. Gabriel are definitely anxious to avoid going near the Law Courts, and wish instead that the Mutasarrif should deal with the case adminis tratively (as he has the right to and can very easily do) and order the matter to be settled by ordinary 'tribal methods' for which there exists a regular machinery in cases where garden owners have disputes with or desire to evict bad fellahs or cultivators.-(3)- 9# Lastly the Shaikh told me that following the normal custom among Basra garden owners when the dates are getting ripe he could have sent a strong party of 'Natours ,r or watchmen who would probably have been able to overawe the ring leaders and their following settle the above difficulty out of hand but as there was a possible risk of a 'clash' or a 'riot' in the present temper of the fellaheen he preferred to hold his hand lest he be accused by the Iraq authorities of sending Kuwait troops to his gardens, and causing disturbances* In other words he is mo»c anxious to give no handle to the Mutasarrif who he feels is against him to bring an accusation against him of interference and doing a high handed action. 10. The Shaikh at the end of our talk angrily said that the responsibp^ty for this Fao business and all his other land troubles lay at the door of His Majesty's G-overnment who by their procrastination and interminable discussions over the question of (a) Bashiyeh, (b) Faddaghiyeh, (c) taxation of his property and (d) customs export tax on produce des tined for his household had been responsible for producing a wide-spread spirit of restlessness and today discontent among his fellaheen, who/nearly all jbelieved that the Iraq Government would win in their contest with His Majesty's G-overnment and would eventually succeed in depriving him (the Shaikh) of all his properties on the Shatt al Arab in spite of what looked like passing British support# 11# I apologise for this hurriedly written letter-(4)- letter but I wanted to get it off before leaving for Baghdad, where I hope to discuss the above matter with Mr. Ogilvie Forbes. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, w „ iK- ■ w Lt-Colonel, Political Agent, Kuwait.qh Translation of letter No # R/3/l085 dated 1st Rabl Thani 1352 (24th July 1933) from His Excellency Shaikh Sir Ahmed Al-Jabir As-Subah, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Ruler of Kuwait to the Political Agent, Kuwait. With reference to the conversation which I had with Your Excellency yesterday regarding the 'Eallaheen' of our date gardens in Fao, and the dis turbances which they are creating. I have to inform Your Excellency that every year, at this season, the palm fronds are cut from the trees and when this takes place we normally send special boats from Kuwait to bring our share of the palm fronds, for our own house-hold use, through our local representative. This is done under the control and check of Fao Customs Department as Your Excellency is aware from the lists, which you annually receive from the Director of Fao Customs. This year according to our usual custom we sent our boats for the above purpose, and our 'Fallaheen^ actually began to cut the palm fronds according to usual custom but certain 'Fallaheen' who in the past have given us a certain amount of trouble started spreading false and malicious stories by means of which they were able to induce the loyal 'Fallaheen' to refuse to deliver to us our share of the palm fronds. We, although we knew about the doings of these evil persons, and their apparent determination to create disturbances, decided to move slowly and patiently in the matter. We therefore instructed our Fao Representative to take up a reasonable attitude and attempt to placate the 'Fallaheen' in case they should have any serious grievances.-(2)- The ring leaders were able, however, to counter his efforts by spreading reports that the autho rities (in Basra) were behind them and would help thenu He, our representative, was obliged therefore to write a letter to us which you will find herewith in original # We, for our part, in spite of the written report of our representative to the effect that the 'Fallaheen' were still refusing to deliver our share of the palm fronds, for a while decided to postpone difect action in the matter^ But when we saw that our tenants persisted in their determination to create trouble and refuse to pay us our dues we instructed our Basra lawyer to put the case officially before the authorities for their consideration and action. He the lawyer duly informed the Mudir of Siba (Fao) who sent for our Fao Agent and asked him for a full report on the case, and especially what had been the customary procedure in the past. Our representative appears to have explained everything to him fully, and the Mudir thereupon wrote to the 'Mukhtar' (head man) of Fao ordering him to instruct the 'Fallaheen' to deliver over to us our usual share, to look soeti after the gardens in their charge properly, to prevent water from flooding the palm areas (by keeping the protective dykes in order), and to drive away all straying or, unknown animals. The 'Mukhtar' informed them accordingly, but we regret to say that nothing at all has resulted from these instructions. Subsequently the Assistant to the Police Commandant of Basra Liwa visited the Fao Administrative Headquarters, and sent for all our 'Fallaheen', and asked them to reply to certain questions which he put to thenu The latter were divided into two part^, the-(3)- the first party replied honestly and gave the true history of everything that pertained to our property but the second party, consisting of the ring leaders and disturbers of the peace, did not give him any clear cut or satisfactory reply. At one time they said that they were the real owners of the land, and at another that they had a right to take for their own use three quarters of the total produce, and again that they lastly thai never gave more than one quarter to the landlord, and / the palm fronds were theirs to dippose of and not the landlord^# After this enquiry the Police Officer returned to Basra, but his investigations have had no result except that some of the loyal 'Fallaheen' have now delivered a small portion of the paM fronds• We heard that on the 25th Rabi Awal 1352, the Mudir of Siba himself again visited Government Headquarters at Fao, and made further enquiries into the matter, returning the same day# We have now been informed that as a result of this visit the tt Mukhtar n of Fao sent for all our rf Fallaheen ft and forbade them to cut down any palm fronds at all, nor to deliver any to us. . We, in spite of all these occurrences and in spite of the fact that it is our firm belief that these communistic activities are not happening Just of themselves, but at the deliberate instigation of some person in the back ground, are averse to taking any direct action to protect our gardens from damage, or even preserve our rightful shares for ourselves, although we could dc this in normal circumstances (by sending armed servants to overawe the rebellious fellahs), until we have reported the matter in detail to Your Excellency and have asked you to refer the whole unfortunate business to those in authority in Iraq who are our neighbours and a friendly government, pointing out that-14}- that the date season is approaching and we cannot leave these evil stirrers of the peace to play havoc with our gardens and that before our very eyes. At the same time we would like to draw Your Excellency's attentionto one important fact, namely that in a short time, we, under normal circumstance^ and in the ordinary form of procedure, will have to send our local representative (Agent) to inspect the dates and make advance contracts ('thaman^) with the fellaheen of our gardens, on our behalf as is the usual custom, I fear that if matters remain in the state they are in at present, the rebellious fellahs will commit acts of open violence and sabotage which we are all anxious to avoid. These disturbers of the peace do not apparently wish to arrive at any settlement and they would seem to be encouraged in their communis tic activities by ±jaa± the fact that the local autho rities appear powerless to stop the trouble or prevent the ring leaders from extending it, I shall therefore be highly obliged if you will,give your kind consideration in this strange out break which has clearly been engineered by some person or persons well up in the methods of an 'Agent Provo cateur' ♦ We are quite confident that our friendly neighbours the Iraq Government will take up this matter vigorouslybut of their high consideration and sense of justice and will take all necessary steps to terminate all the sources of trouble. Lastly I would ask Your Excellency to give your best assistance in bringing the facts of this cjearly to the authori ties concerned.Translation of letter dated the 4tti Habi Awal 1352 (26th June 1933) from the Shaikh's Agent Salman Bin Mohammed As-Salman, Fao, to His Sxcellency Shaikh Ahmed Al-Jabtr As- Subah. With the hand of obedience I have received your high orders which you sent me with your servant the Nakhuda Abdul-Rasol, and everything has been noted by me. With regard to the share of the palm fronds which belong to Your Excellency I beg to inform you that I duly ordered the ^Fallaheen' to hand same over and I also arranged for the boat of the above men tioned Nakhuda to start loading. He, as directed, began to ship, while most of the 'Fallaheen' began to cut the palm fronds, but others led by ring leaders who were out to give trouble started putting about strange stories, and unfortunately were able to make the loyal ^Fallaheen' believe their false rumours* Sir, believe me, that your tenants are very ignorant men and know absolutely nothing about the real matters that count, so being persuaded they refused to deliver the portion of the palm fronds due h under the law to you the landlord. In view of the near approach of the date season, should the rebellious fellahs persist in making trouble, and not to be checked in some way, grave injury will be done to the rights and profits of both landlord and tenant. Indeed it is clear to me that the troubles are already extending* I could not write earlier to Your Sxcellency and give you details of these disturbances because I was engaged in trying to combat ignorance and show the tenants the unwisdom of their ways#/cl I I sent persons to persuade the rebels 'but I do not find a single wise man among them so I have been compelled to refer the whole matter to Your Excellency, because the boat is delayed and we are expecting your orders# * Note by the Political Agent, The rumours according to the Shaikh which were put about were that the Iraq G-overnment were going to support the fellahs against the Shaikh of Kuwait who was going to be deprived of his Fao estates, and that they would be divided up among existing Fallaheen.4 CONriDENTIAL. &gt; i' I* No. 943-S of 1933.

It is a melancholy reflection on the state of the Basrah Bar if the Shaikh is 'unable to obtain disinterested legal advice from that city. I can suggest no remedy, how ever, other than retaining the services of a Bagdad advocate, which would be a most costly proceeding. I have the honour to be Sir Your obedient ServantOpinion on points raised in paragraph 3 of the Honourable Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, despatch No. 614 01 June 7th, 1933. r'N ^ — The Political Resident asks (a) whether the Shaikh could ohtain a stay of execution, (h) file a cross suit, and (c) whether the defendants in the cross suit could claim mesne profits. I will deal with (c) first. I have consulted Mr. Drower on this point. He is of the opinion that the court would not consider an application for mesne profits owing to the fact that the claimants 1 right of action has 'been open to them for years past, and, accordingly, they must 'be held to have acquiesced in cultivation 'by the Shaikh during the period in which they might have 'brought their claim 'but did not do so. As regards (a), there is no precise parallel in 1 Iraq, procedure to a stay of execution. In both the Bashiyah and Paddaghiyah suits, however, the Shaikh would appear to have plenty of time to prosecute his counter claim. In the first place, it would appear almost impossible for the Shaikh to lose possession of either estate until all the claimants have obtained judgment in their favour. As regards the Bashiyah case the position at the moment is that one claimant, Rafiah, has established her claim to approximately one twelfth of that portion of the Bashiyah estate concerning which the Shaikh's title is in doubt. Other claimants have filed suits covering the remainder of the disputed area, but so far no service has been effected on the Shaikh. Since obtaining judgment, so far as I know, Hafiah has taken no steps to obtain execution. It is now open to her to enter into an arrangement with the Shaikh for her share of the profits of cultivation. If this fails she can apply to the court for actual physical division /of101 - 2 - of the land. But here her difficulties will 'begin. court will not cut off a slice of the estate approximating to her share and give it to her; on the contrary, the division has to 'be one twelfth of every acre, yard, or square inch. With other suits pending concerning the property to he divided the Court would almost certainly postpone actual physical division of the land until those suits had 'been determined. In the case of the Faddaghiyah estate only one claimant has so far entered an action, Abdullah ibn Isa, and his claim is as to one third. The same considerations apply here, name ly that in practice it would be extremely difficult to oust the Shaikh from possession until adjudication had been completed on claims to the remainder of the property. (b) Mr. Drower is of opinion that the court would not hear a counter claim for a return of the purchase money until judg ment has been given against the Shaikh. The Shaikh could of course proceed piecemeal. Thus he might claim a proportionate return of the purchase money from Rafiah, assuming that he can show her to be an heir of the vendor, or he can wait until judgment has been given against him on the remaining Bashiyah suits and then proceed against all the successful claimants. Alternatively, if he admits the claim both in the Bashiyah and Faddaghiyah estates, he could file his counter claim at once. No doubt his best course of action is to adjnit nothing and keep his counter claim in reserve. The process of execution in this country works so slowly in normal cases that the chances of the Shaikh losing possession anterior to the determination of his counter claim seem remote. The G-ilbertian situation envisaged by the Political Resident in paragraph 2 of his despatch is quite a possibility. If the Shaikh obtains judgment for return of the purchase money he must first distrain on the movable property of the /debtor- 3 - debtor or debtors and if he cannot thus obtain payment he may seize and sell through the Execution Office their land or undivided shares in land. It thus might happen that he would obtain seizure and sale of the share which he had just lost and, if the market is poor, buy it in for the debt, so that the parties would be as they were at first except that the Shaikh would then get a good title through the sale by the Bxecution Office.

No. 75 dated the 20th April 1933, paragraphs 6 and 7 and your confidential despatch No.451 -S, dated the 1st May 1933 to H.B.M's Ambassador at Angora. when the Hon'ble Lieut-Colonel Fowle was here recently (July) on his way through to the United Kingdom, His Excellency the Shaikh told him and me that he had heard from his Lawyer (Mr. Gabriel of Messrs Arteen and Yacub) in Basra that the ^Ori^inal Power of Attorney ' given by Aishah bint Abdullah Chelabi as-Zuhair to her husband Ahmad Pasha al- Zuhair empowering him to sell the Faddaghiyah Estate for her had been found in Constantinople and was now in his (the Lawyer's) possession in Basra. I have the honour to inform you that1^ -(2)- 5, It appears that the enterprising lawyer, not content with getting us to move in the matter through the British Ambassador at Angora, had him self also sent a trusty man armed with the necessary 'gold' to see what he could do in the Constantinople 'Somerset House'. He was apparently quite success ful, and was able to get the original document for the sum of £50. 4. The production of this very valuable document puts an entirely new complexion on the Faddaghiyah Law Suit which is to be filed shortly. 5. During my recent visit to Baghdad (E8th July) the question of this document was fully dis cussed with H.M 1 s Charge d'Affaires, Mr. Nihill (Legal Secretary) and Mr, Stafford (Finance Secre tary) and I was asked to get a copy from Mr.G-abriel of Arteen and Arcoob (Yacub) . This I am doing. I was also asked to give certain other messages to Mr. G-abriel, which I duly delivered verbally and by letter on my return to Kuwait on 5rd August. 6. According to Mr. Nihill, he had reliable private information that the Iraq Courts would find some way very soon, of serving their summons on the Shaikh, and that the Faddaghiy ah^jg^ s^ would then come up for hearing somewhere on orthe 15th September 1933. That hitherto we had all played for delay, and to this end had told the Shaikh not to accept service himself or authorise his Lawyers to do so. The production of the lost ' Power of Attornev V has now he said so eompletely altered the situation in the Shaikh's favour, that there was nov/ really no objection to the Shaikh authorising his Lawyers to Sec fw 1 h/JUlt? iuiu (if (*&lt;({'rfM accept f// K*-13)- accept service and prepare to defend the suit. In fact this was a desirable move# *1 • I agree with Mr. Nihill's views, and get while warning Mr. Gabriel to/ready his defence, I have told him I would see about getting instruc tions from His Majesty^ Government permitting me to tell the Shaikh that he could now with safety go ahead and authorise his lawyers to defend the case when it comes forward# 8. I much regret that I did not inform you about the recovery of the Power of Attorney before, but I went down with fever during Colonel Fowled visit here, and was laid up for some days after he went. Then came my hurried visit to Baghdad which prevented my attending to much important work that was awaiting me. I should be grateful now if you would raise the point I have mentioned in paragraph 7 above with His Majesty 1 s Government and could authorise me ito tell the Shaikh that he can now with safety empower his Basra Lawyers to accept rt service' on his behalf and get ready to defend his interests. In doing this I would ask that there be as little delay as possible, as according to Mr. Nihill the case will certainly come on before the 15th September next. I have the honour to be.

I should be grateful if you will give me the information asked for, as soon as you can. 3. Mr. Hihlll also asked me to mention to you that he has it on good authority that service on the Shaikh will by some means or other be effected by September 15th, and that therefore you should be ready by that date to file his defence.

Aa you know the shaikh has not to date given authority you aiqithiaa to accept any 'eorvice' of documents, sumnonsoa etc on his behalf* This the Shaikh did on the advice of His Majesty's Govenuaent given through me.

CEHTAP^ OFJIGI ALS OF TH3 EMBASSY ETC Al^D TSB AND THE POLITICAL AGENT KUWAIT BETWEEN THE 28th JULY to 5rd AUGUST 1955 , 1* I arrived in Baghdad by Air on Friday the 28th July and stayed with H.M's Charge dSAffaires, 2. On Saturday 29th July . The Fao agrarian troubles were discussed at a meeting consisting of Mr. Nihill the Legal Adviser to H^M 1 s Ambassador, Mr. Stafford, Financial Adviser, and myself. At this meeting I I explained what iofi/knew about the troubles and read out letter No # 172 dated the 27th July with enclosures, which I had two days previously submitted to the Hobble the Political Resident at Bushire. Mr.Stafford | ^ j. then showed me H.M.Government T s telegram to the ^ Charge d'Affaires dated the 28th July 1955 and the draft letter which it was proposed should be sent to the Prime Minister of Iraq. I agreed with Mr. Stafford^ suggestion that the word 'sabotageshould be omitted from this letter as likely to complicate matters. It was also agreed that if possible I should personally discuss the matter with the Prime Minister, before presenta tion of the letter, and to this end the Prime Minister was invited to dine with Mr. Ogilvie Forbes the following night (Sunday). The same evening I met Mr. Edmonds, Acting Adviser to the Ministry of Interior and talked over the Shaikh's difficulties. 5. On Sunday the 50th July . I met the Prime Minister, H.E. Raschid Ali Gailani, as arranged, and after dinner was given an opportunity of having a private talk with him. The Prime Minister was extremely cordial and affable and showed pleasure and surprise at the ease with which II was able to speak his language. This possibly- led him to 'open his heart' in the rather surprising way he did. He quite candidly and openly discussed (i) King Bin Saud and his affairs (ii) King Faisal's aspirations (iii) Shaikh of Kuwaiti troubles. At the same time it is only fair to say that he several times remarked that what he told me were his personal views only, and that he did so because he saw that I was a lover of the Arab and so felt sympathetically inclined towards me* As regards (i) the Prime Minister opined that Bin Saud was very near being on the rocks, and that unless he took a pull at himself the 'crash' would soon come. He was bankrupt and the recent Asir Campaign had just about given him his 'coup de grace'. His stupid and cruel treatment of the great Najd tribes had alienated the affections of every one throughout Arabia. All his people were quietly and patiently awaiting the end. He particularly blamed Bin Saud^ false and traitorous (his words) Egyptian and Syrian advisers, who were only playing for themselves and not for Bin iiaud* ?/ith thie death of Bin Saud he saw complete chaos, and then Iraq, Transjordan, Kuwait, etc., would come into their own. He blamed His Majesty 1 s G-overnment for allowing Bin Saud so much rope, especially in his dealings with the U.S.S.R., and emphasised that the Amir Faisal's visit to Moscow was not the innocent one that His Majesty's G-overnment supposed. Bin Saud was deliberately trying to play off Moscow against London, and would go on dping so by means of other foreign powers also. He was severely critical of His Majesty's Government for allowing BinvA -(Si- Bin Saud to go on blockading Kuwait as he was doing, and opined that His Majesty's Government had only to ^turn her face' from Bin Saud or simply threaten to do this, for Bin Saud to ' come to heel Tt at once # He was an Arab and understood a fellow Arab better than His Majesty's Government, and if only His Majesty's Government would firmly tell Bin Saud, once and for all, to stop bullying Kuwait, why the results would be surprising: (This remark amused me not a little)• Bin Saud knew better than any one that it was His Majesty's Government alone who saved him during the Akhwan rebellion and the more recent Ibn Rifada trouble. He Bin Saud knew that if we were to withdraw our good will^ then all the tribes in Arabia would at once break out into revolt. Bin Saud only kept them quiet by preaching that His Majesty's Government was under an obligation to him and would come to his help against his own people if need be. As regards (ii). The Prime Minister opined that King Faisal w&amp;s England's real friend, and not Bin Saud, for Faisal knew and realised that he could not stand without His Majesty's Government's continuous help. This being so His Majesty's Government should have more confidence in Faisal and allow him to widen his territories, in opposition to Bin Saud who was not a friend but really an enemy of England, as we should some day see. Everyone knew that neither Kuwait nor TransJordan could dtand alone economically or other wise, what better than to allow Iraq to absorb both^ by means of fair and suitable treaties. This would not mean the removal of Amir Abdullah or Shaikh Ahmad-U)- Ahmad; both would retain their personal powers, and continue to run the internal administration of their states without interference. All that the head state Iraq would be responsible for would be their Foreign Policy # The Prime Minister then asked if I did not agree with this view, but I fear received only a laughing and non-committal answer. As regards (iii) Kuwait . The Prime Minister expressed much sympathy with the ShaiWti over the question of the Istahlak tax, and said that he had heard confi dentially from London that the matter would shortly be settled satisfactorily to both Iraq and Kuwait. Iraq would waive all her past revenjie^and His Majesty's Government would pay Kuwait's share of all future land revenue to Ir^q. He said nothing about the Faddaghiyah or Bashigeh cases, but asked what the Shaikh had thought of King Faisal, and his recep tion in Baghdad last year. He emphasised how much he personally had liked the Shaikh and was most impressed with his courtly and charming bearing. He knew also that Faisal thDUght the same as himself. It was here that I thought the opportunity an excellent one to open the question of the Shaikh's Fao property and the communistic trouble that was going on there. This I did in detail, giving it as my opinion that the fellaheen had got out of hand either because of some interested and unknown persons intrigue, or because the long delay in the settlement of the Bashigeh and Faddaghiyah cases which every one believed would eventually be taken from the Shaikh had encouraged the fellaheen to think that they might be successful also in getting a slice from the Shaikh's estates if they made enough noise. I then quoted the Bedouin proverb 'when the camel is down out comes everybody's knives' which pleased the-(5)- the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister expressed great surprise that suoh a situation had been allowed to arise, and especially that he had not been told about it. He promised to take immediate action in the matter and said he would telegraph to the Mutasarrif Basra, and order him to get in to the trouble at once. I pointed out that the Shaikh was mofet averse to doing anything that might be construed by the local Government as 'irritating the situa- tion TT , so had not sent as yet any naturs to watch the date crops, as is customary each year. I suggested that as the Mutasarrif had definite machinery for settling disputes between landlord and fellah, it should be put into motion and the trouble would cease. He agreed and thanked me for telling me about the matter and asked me to give his compliments to the Shaikh and tell him not to be anxious about the final result. I here thanked the Prime Minister and our talk ended. Note. I have given the Prime Minister's taj.k somewhat at length as it may be found of interest although I quite realise that what he said did not cencern the business I was on. On Mo nday 51st July . I had another meeting with Mr. Stafford and Mr, Nihill. The Faddaghiyah case was discussed and especially the recovery of the 'Power of Attorney' which Aisha gave to her husband, authorising him to sell the Faddaghiyah to Shaikh Mubarak. It was agreed that the obtain ing of this document put a complete new complexion on the matter. I was asked (a) to obtain a copy of-(6)- of the Power of Attorney for the Embassy and (b) to warn the Shaikh and Mr. G-abriel (Lawyer) that the Basra Courts would find a way of serving a summons shortly on him, either by registered letters or by publishing it in the Basra papersp# (c) To tell Mr. G-afariel to prepare to file his defence before the 15th September, as there was evidence to show that the case would come off about then. (d) I was further asked to obtain from Mr. Gahriel all the names of the living heirs of Aiysha. Mr. Nihill gave it as his opinion that His Majesty's Government's delaying action had been very helpful and that now there was no longer any reason why the Shaikh shcbuld avoid defending the case when it came forward. I agreed and promised to get all the information he wanted. 5. On Monday the Slst July (Noon) . At the suggestion of Mr. Ogilvie Forbes, I went and saw Mr. Monk, acting Director G-eneral of Customs, regarding the alleged excessive contraband that was passing from Kuwait into Iraq. I found Mr. Monk not particularly helpful at first. His attitude, I fear, was that of the Englishman who has become more IRAQI than the real article. Kuwait was the sinner and must be punished. Iraq was the poor suffering innocent party, struggling to do the right thing. Kuwait must be brought to her senses, either by the method of depriving her of her drinking water from the Shatt-al-Arab, or by a policy of super frightfullness on all and sundry caught smuggling. That is to say by shoot ing out of hand anynperson so caught. Mr. Monk's final contribution for the solution to the problem was1^ -(7)- was for His llajesty's G-overnment to force Kuwait to raise her Customs duties to the same level as tp&amp;t of Iraq. This he assured me oould and would be done sooner than I expected. After patiently hearing to all he had to say, I pointed out that (a) Kuwait was not hostile to Iraq as he seemed to think, (h) that the Shaikh was taking all precautions in his power to stop smuggling but had difficulties of finance, etc. (c) That Iraq were apparently under a serious delusion as to the amount of contrabclnd that went from Kuwait. In reality the traffic was not great and the Bedouin; were the chief culprits, but that they^were most difficult to catch, seeing that they came in from all quarters of the desert and bought only in small quantities and ostensibly for themselveso (d) I suggested that the Iraq Customs Department should really make some effort themselves to place Customs Posts on the 100 miles of Kuwait-Iraq land frontier. They had a single immobile post Asagwan, which merely watched the Basra - Kuwait motor road, but that 80 miles of frontier was without a single post nor was a patrol ever sent along,the Batin from Sa^r/an to Rigai. In fact the door was entirely open, and the Bedouins had no difficulty in crossing into Iraq whereever and whenlever they wanted, (e) I suggested that the Iraq Customs would do well to place 4 Customs posts on this Batin line, instead of trying by a process of frightfulness £6 bluff to get Kuwait to do their work for them. (f) I pointed out that the Shaikh of Kuwait*s point of view could be put in a nutshell. He was sympathetic and would always do his best to cooperate, but Iraq must hersel watc-(8)- watch her own frontiers. It was not Kuwait^ business to do this. (g) Lastly I pointed out that with Bin Saud's Customs duties averaging 150$&gt; ad valorem and Iraqis averaging some 60% it was obvious that 90% of the contraband trade would go into Saudi Arabia, for clearly the profits were so much greater. Kuwait's whole policy was to break Bin Saud^ Blockade, whether by sea or land. They had a definite quarrel with Bin Saud but none with Iraq. (h) In conclusion I suggested with, some diffidence that the Iraq Customs should be c/^aeful not to swallow all the stories of the many Fao and Zubair spj-es who they employed. These men had to live, and good information meant good pay. (i) I think I was able to make Mr. Monk see a little of Kuwait's point of view before I left. 6. On Wednesday the 2nd August . Mr. Stafford with regard to my discussions with Mr. Monk. I think I was able to clear up much that was not understood before. In particular I believe I was able to convince Mr. Stafford that the so called 'Contraband' running from Kuwait to Iraq was nothing like as serious as the Iraq Government tried to make out. I offered the suggestion that perhaps it was part and parcel of the Shatt al Arab gardens business, and might not be unconnected with the Iraq Grovernment* s desire to get control of Kuwait- 7. I returned to Kuwait by air on 3rd August. I had a full and frank discussion with - ' ''Lt-Colonel Political Agent,Kuwait 8th August 1933 #•v p.: vA 3] \a By AIR MIL BUS •^StOENCY.

Dear Colonel Dickson, ^ X have your esteemed favour No,175 of 5th inst., and not© contents, 2. Herewith a complete list of the present living heirs of Ahmed Pasha Azzuhair. In view of the existence of the Power of Attorney by Awasha to Ahmed I may be allowed to point out that in my humble opinion there will be no question of bringing in Ahmed*s heirs as parties to the present suit, 3. Having studied the case well during the last six months I may venture to say that I am now fully acquainted with the facts and ^merits thereof and am therefore quite prepared to appear at any date to defend the case before the Court, 4. Before going into the question of the vakala I have to submit to the Court three successive preliminary issues namely (1) that plaintiff having been considered by the Court a pauper he shall therefore not be in a position to meet defendant's costs if he loses his action. The Court may therefor© order the plaintiff to furnish an ade quate security for such costs, failing which his claim may not be entertained. If this first issue is answered in affirmative the (2) will be that defendant disputes plaintiff's title to the claim. Should this 2nd issue be decided in favour of plaintiff the (3) willbe that the suit is time barred under the Indian Limitation Act IX of 1908, Should all the said three issues be decided success ively against defendant the principle defence re the subject matter in dispute will then be brought up when it will be necessary to produce the famous vakala and pray to the Court for leave to file defendant's counter claim for/{?( &lt;*{ J3)* for the recovery of the purchase money, with proviso that the defendant he entitled to retain the property in dispute as a pledge until such time as the purchase price is fully recovered with interest thereon, I am more than sure that the case will ultimately result in success in defendant's favour; but from the economy point of view I shall endeavour to achieve that aim by a point other than that of the vakala by a counter suit, §♦ Very many thanks for your kind efforts in oonnec- tion with my fees. The retention fee is I.Dinars 157•500 yearly, I have to come to Kuwait shortly, as a matter of fact I intendedto do so since ten days but for some very important affair of His Excellency the Shaikh I am being put off daily with promises. I am now very busy doing all that is possible and pressing forward with a view of securing a final favourable result thereof. 6« If your good self does not find it Inadvisable the drawing of the fresh General Power of Attorney may be delayed pending my arrival to Kuwait. It is rather surprising that my letter of 1st August posted on the same date should have reached you so late. Your favour under reply is dated 5th August, the posts seals on the envelope show that it was posted at Kuwait on the 0th, reached Basrah 11th and was delivered to me on the 12th.

Sir, |' V ' In continuation of my confidential letter No. 1179 dated the 8th August and paragraph 5(iii) of enclosure to same, I have the honour to furnish the following progress report in the matter of the settle ment of the Fao gardens trouble, 2. On the 10th August 1953 {i.e. 8 days after my return from Baghdad) there were no visible signs that the Iraq Government had moved in the matter, or were even contemplating action as a result of His Majesty^ Government's representations (see Secretary of State* for Foreign Affairs* telegram dated the 28th July to Charge d T Affaires, Baghdad), / On the 11th August His Excellency the Shaikh called on me and rather bitterly said that condi tions in his gardens at Fao were as bad as ever they had been, and that he had just received a message from his Agent to the effect that on the 8th August the latter had endeavoured to send a party of official assessors to estimate the date crop as is ordinarily done at this season, but that the said party had been met- (2) - met by a crowd of threatening fellaheen who had driven them out of the gardens. His Excellency^as a result fcaid that he was constarined to request me to telegraph the situation to you and H .M* s Charge d^ffaires. 4. I, however, counselled patience, and pointed out that the return of the King to Iraq, and the Assyrian troubles might quite easily have caused the Fao business to be overlooked, I added that I felt quite sure that the Prime Minister would imple ment his promises made to me if only given time. This seemed to satisfy the Shaikh somewhat, 5, On the 14th August feeling uneasy about the non receipt of favourable news from Fao, I addressed a short personal note to the Shaikh asking how the situation stood. His Excellency replied the same day (letter ^ enclosed) and forwarded a letter from his Lawyer {Mr. Gabriel) dated the 11th August (letter 'B* enclosed), 6, In view of the Lawyer's statement that he hoped that the troubles would be ended in two or three days, I called on the Shaikh and advised his waiting another day or two before I took fibsther action. He agreed, but pointed out the danger of further delay, as the dates were nearly ripe, and unless the fruit on each tree was assessed, there was nothing to prevent the fellaheen picking and disposing of it themselves# 7. The Shaikh then infoimed me that he had that morning received a very urgent telegraphic request for I.Dinars 500/- from his Lawyer, which the telegram said was for a very special object . And that trusting his Lawyer he had telegraphed his Bank in Basra to handu If? -(3)- hand over the money. 8* On the 16th August the Shaikh sent me a telegram to see from his Lawyer which read 'Orders have gone forth (from the Mutasarrif), and I have instructed the date assessors to proceed to the Fao gardens to estimate the crop at once'. 9. The above is the situation as far as is known at present, and I have considered it my duty to let you know how things stand. Whether this troublesome matter can be said to have been finally settled or not, I am not in a position to say. 10 ♦ Xx iill along everything has depended on whether the Mutasarrif, Basra, meant business or not. If he honestly intended to settle the trouble he had the necessary machinery at hand, if he did not^then he could pervaricate and delay matters until the date crop was disposed of by the fellaheen. 11. What made me anxious was the well known anti-Snglish attitude of the Mutasarrif and the fact that he bears the Shaikh a personal grudge of long standing. 12. I will report further progress as I get news. I have the honour to be.

Note by P.A . * TEis was a personal letter from myself to His Excellency the Shaikh dated 14th August 1933 enquiring how the Fao situation was progressing, as the Shaikh had called on me 3 days previously and said the situa tion in his gardens was lis bad as ever it was, and that the party sent by his agent to assess the date crop on 8th August had been forcibly rejected by a mob of Fallahs. I had advised the Shaikh to wait 3 days as the King* s return to Baghdad and the Assyrian / question had perhaps delayed matters in Baghdad.1 B* ^ 5 Translation of a letter dated the 19tli Rani Thani 1352 (lltli August 1933) from Messrs Arteen and Akoab (Mr, G-abriel) , Basra, to His Excellency the Shaikhnof Kuwait• After compliments.

The rapid changes in the Fao affairs are so important, that we have been compelled to neglect all out other business for the present and concentrate our thoughts and time on finding out a method of solving this intricate matter, and putting an end to the existing state of affairs, which is an unpar^allelled one and has been going on for too long now. For the same reason we have not had time to reply your letters in detail. We beg to assure you that our endeavours and efforts will not be in vain. By the G-race of G-od the case will be settled finally in two or three days. We desire to present ourselves to Your Excellency to explain the matter in detail, and take your instructions in respect of the Fao case in particular and the other cases in general , and especially do we wish to consult you about rooting out this rebellion, and arrange for the securing of Your Excellency^ rights for the future.

Subject:- Agrarian Troubles on the Shaikhs Fao Estates . pyf' In continuation of my Confidential Despatch No. 194 dated the 19th August 1933 and paragraph 8, I have the honour to inform you that on the 21st August I called on His Excellency the Shaikh to enquire how the assessment of the date crops on his Fao Estates was pro gressing, and generally to find out the latest situation. 2. I am glad to report that His Excellency informed me that he had received news from his Fao Agent to the effect that matters were progressing much more favourably than before, and that the party of assessors ('Khawaris') sent^out by his Agent accompanied by Policemen were doing theirZexpeditiously and well under police protection. 3. When I asked how the men who had caused all the trouble were behaving, the Shaikh replied that they were still capable of mischief but were afraid to act for fear of the Police who accompanied the assessors. He added, however, that they appeared more subdued than before, and to be distinctly impressed with the support which the Agent was receiving from the Mudir of Siba and Fao, as instanced by the presence of the Police.I&lt;\\ -(2)- 4, It appears that the ringleaders who were at the bottom of the original trouble lecently went to Basra to complain to the Mutasarrif against the action of the Qaimakam, Shatt-al-Arab, for his support to the Shaikh of Kuwait, but had got no change. 5« On the face of it, therefore, matters seem to be progressing quite favourably, although I think it is perhaps premature to say definitely that the trouble has been scotched for good. 6. Without doubt Baghdad has moved in the matter, and the Mutasarrif has been told pretty plainly to stop the trouble. 7.

As Mr. Nihill expected that something of this nature would happen, not much harm has been done as far as I can see. If the service had not been done this way, the Basra Courts would merely have posted this notice of summons in some Basra paper or nailed it to one of the trees in the Shaikh's garden. 5.

Baghdad. 25th July, 1933. 4 air, vith reference to ray Saving telegram Mo.( July 20th regarding the outbreak of trouble anongst the fellaheen on the shaikh of Kuwait's estates at /ao, I will nov? sum arise the facts given to me by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. 2. According to Colonel Dickson, the Political Agent at Kuwait, the shaikh has received news from his agent at Fao to the effect that the trouble began in the northern half of the property, and then rapidly spread to the southern half. Many acts of sabotage are reported to have teken place, such as the cutting down of trees. About two-thirds of the fellaheen have refused to supply to the ahaikh's agent the firewood, palm fronds, fruit and fodder which are normally sent to Kuwait at this time of the year for the use of the Shaikh's household. 3. In reply to the agent's protests the fellaheen appear to have everywhere given a corrmon form of reply, namely, 'The *Iraqi Governnent, not the Shaikh of Kuwait, is our Government; we are the owners of the soil and have been born and bred on it. Our Goverrraent is going to help us and meke us proprietors.' 4. According to the shaikh, the agent further reported that he had officially complained to the ttudir of Fao about the behaviour of the fellaheen; that the Mudir-2- p Mudir had sent for the headmen and told them that they must behave themselves, and pay the shaikh quietly and in an orderly manner, but that so far nothing had happened. 5. The Shaikh appears, according to Colonel Dickson, to hold the opinion that the MUdir of fm is himself at the bottom of the trouble and that he is acting under the secret and express order of the Mutasarrif of Basra. Colonel Dickson appears to share this opinion but, in the absence of evidence, I hesitate to accept /V 6. as suggested in my Saving telefrftn under reference, I an inclined to regard as highly significant the fact that Mr. Gabriel, the Bhaikh 1 s lawyer, foretold these happenings with almost complete exactitude about a month before they occurred* In this connection I would refer you to the Political Resident's despatch to the India Office No.640 of June loth last. At the sane time, jfj $1'*' he apparently advissed the ghaikh to authorise him to take out Tapu deeds, a work of research which, owin^ to the complexity of the estate, would no doubt have provided Mr. Gabriel with profitable occupation. The Shaikh, for various reasons, hesitated to do this. Although it, is, 1 adnit, only a hypothesis, it is not, I consider, unreasonable to suspect that this Aimenian lawyer is connected with the Basrah lawyers who are said to be advising the fellaheen. 7. with regard to action in ♦Iraq, I feel that, for the moment, nothing more can be done than to await the result of the intervention that Major Ednonds has promised me. Meanwhile the shaikh's agent should, of course, seek the aid of the Police and initiate prosecutions against any of the fellaheen who have committed actual breaches of the law. y&gt;. M ^ 8. Tne legal aspect of this question is dealt with in my despatch No.28 of June 29th to the Political Besldent, a copy of which is enclosed. Even without Tapu registration thethe 'Sialkh would appear to be reasonably secure from legal attack. 9. in view of the Importance which His Madesty's Government attaches to the difficulties which the Shaikh of Kuwait is encountering with the 'Iraqi Government, l suggested to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf on his Journey through Baghdad that it would he useful if the political Agent at Kuwait could pay a short visit Colonel Fowle concurred end I understand to this Embassy. that the sanction of the Government ot India is being sought. I feel sure that an exchange of views, in order to co-ordinate action both eb regards the Fao estate and the Shaikh's other properties in 1 Iraq, should prove useful I have the honour to be with the highest respect. etc. (Sd) G.OGILVIE K)RBES. i The Right Honourable Sir John Simon, G.C.3.I., K.C.V.O., etc., etc., etc.P.Z. 5197/33.

My dear Prime Minister, I am sending over with this letter an official note on the subject of the trouble that has broken out in the haikh of Kuwait's estate at ifao. Amidst Your Excellency's many activities it is possible that news of the serious situation that has arisen at Fao may not have reached you. Briefly, it appears that the fellaheen in the date gardens have refused to deliver to the Shaikh's agent his share in the various produce which it is customary to send to Kuwait at this time of the year. Further, from the reports we have received from the Political Agent at Kuwait, the fellaheen appear to be in an ugly mood and to be making claims to the soil of a communistic nature. Actual acts of violence also are reported to have occurred. it devolves upon the 'Iraqi Irovernment to take immediate action to nip this movement in the bud, not only because the interests of a friendly and neighbouring State are involved, but because unless stern measures be taken at once, such a movement may easily spread to other estates in 'Iraq and thus involve the general peace and security of the country. concern felt by His Majesty's Government and this letter is merely to impress upon you personally the need for the issue of immediate instructions to the authorities at Basrah and Fao. It will, I think, be obvious to Your Excellency that My note will demonstrate to Your Excellency the grave Yours sincerely, (Sd). 0. OSILVIE-FORBES.

(7^ Political Agent, Kuwait; The Hon'ble the Political Resid^ntOONflOG^fMu in the Persian Culf, B U 3 E I R E « Agrarian Troubles on Shaikh of Kuwaits Fao Estate. Sir, In continuation of my telegram No.207, dated the 5th September 1933 - Fao Situation - I have the honour to forward fuller details of recent happenings with certain criticisms of my own, from which you will obsefve that the situation has reached an alarming stage chiefly because of the near approach of the time when the dates will be cut. 2. On 30th August His Excellency the Shaikh called on me and reported with some agitation, that just as he thought all was panning out well at Fao, he had received the disquieting news that the ringleaders in the troubles there, had again visited the Mutasarrif at Basra and on returning to Fao, had spread the story every where that he (the Shaikh) was going to be coerced into accepting half shares with the fellaheen, on the produce of his estate, instead of the division being made on the universally accepted basis of 56$? to the landlord and 44 0 / q to the fellah. The Shaikh added that he had at once sent a special and trusty messenger to his lawyer, Mr. Gabriel in Basra, to find out what was in the wind. 3 # On 2nd September the Shaikh called on me again and informed me that his messenger had returned bearing- 2 - bearing two letters from llr.Gabriel, which confirmed the above story, and baldly asked for instructions. The messenger further brought a confidential verbal report from Mr^Gabriel to himself (the Shaikh)(he clearly was afraid to commit it to writing), the gist of which was that the I£utasarrif had sent for him (the lawyer) and had told him (also verbally) that (a) The Shaikh must divide the produce of his gardens at Fao with his fellaheen on a 50/50 basis and not according to the customary 56/44 per cent basis; (b) That the Shaikh must dismiss his Fao Agent at once. (He is one of the Shaikhs own tenants^® (c) That the Shaikh was not at liberty to send any watchmen to guard the ripening dates as is the custom everywhere. (d) That he, the lawyer, would be held personally responsible that (cj was carried out. (e) That if the Shaikh agreed to (a) and (b) he (the Mutasarrif) would settle his dispute with his fellaheen out of hand, but that if he did not, then he would have nothing further to do with him, and the Shaikh could go to the courts if he chose. He would not help. The message further added that it was now very clear to him (the lawyer) that the Mutasarrif was at the bottom of the whole Fao business and was probably acting under orders, but that he dare not suggest such a thing in writing# last ly that the threatening attitude of the Mutasarrif to him self had made him nervous about his own safety and future career, and he suggested that perhaps the Shaikhs best course was to submit to force majeure for an appeal to the lu courts,, seeing that the Shaikh possessed no Tapu deeds, would clearly involve endless litigation, much expense, and prob ably loss through delay of his 1935 date crop. All this, without doubt, the Mutasarrif ?^as fully aware of. 5 # On 3rd September the Shaikh sent his Secretary to show me the draft of his reply to Mr. Gabriel. This ran• 2 - ran as follows: Mr•Gabriel to inform the Mutasarrif that he could not agree to his terms for the following reasons (a) He (the Mutasarrif) had no right to dis criminate against him from among all 'Iraq landlords by trying to alter the law which fixed the shares of landlord and tenant: (b) He had no rightmost introduce^ the new and^ highly objectionable suggestion of a division of produce on a new basis, when all he had asked for was protection against half a dozen disturbers of the peace, who were re sisting his agent and victimizing his other fellaheen, 90 per cent of whom were loyal and contented men. The Shaikh also instructed his lawyer not to allow the case to get into the courts on any account, and refused to comply with the lawyers request for a Power of Attorney to represent him legally where the ?ao Estate was concerned. (The lawyer in one of his letters had asked for this.) 6 # On 4th September I saw the Shaikh again and he informed me that he had just received a widely signed pe tition from his tenants at Pao, deploring the activities of the rebellious minority, and the Mutasarrifs strange way of trying to appease them. They protested their loyal ty and complete readiness to pay their overlord, his share of the date and other crops on the well understood and established basis of 44/56 per cent. 7 # It is indeed a matter of great regret to me that just as this troublesome affair appeared to be on the high road to settlement, and which, as far as I can see, presents no real difficulties at all, the Mutasarrif, Basra, should have thought fit to deliVferately enter the lists and spoil everything. 8 # On the plea, no doubt, that he found that the discontented few had a certain amount of right on their side seeing that they were 'Taab' tenants who had actually planted the palm trees and generally had converted what was originally marshy and bad land into good land, he had7 ^ - 4 - V- had caused it to become known botli among loyal and disloyal fellaheen that he would ccmpel the Shaikh to accept 50^ of the produce as his share instead of the usual 56$, the remaining 5CF/o to go to the fellaheen. This action has upset everyone» contented and discontented alike and has gone far to undo all the good work that has recently been done by His Majesty's Ghargfe d'Affaires with the 'Iraq Grovemment• 9 # I cannot but come to the regretful conclusion, ■ and I know His Excellency the Shaikh entirely shares my views, * that the Mutasarrif has acted as he has done, with the de liberate intention of spoiling the settlement which was in sight, either at the instance of the central Government, or out of personal hostility and desire to hurt the Shaikh* Indeed the attitude of the Mutasarrif bears an all too close resemblance to the methods of officials under the old Turkish regime, who were for ever purposely creating awkward Agrarian situations, as between landlord and culti vator, in order to make profit by putting things right again for a consideration. 10 # Actually, the facts about the landlord and cultivator shares are as follows, in case you are unaware of them:- In Turkish tiiries when the 'Mir/i' or '^Qlums t, system was in force, right down to the recent introduction of the ^Istahlak' system of taxation, the law laid it down that the fellah's share of the date crop and other produce was 40$ and that of the 'Mallak* (landlord) 60$. This was considered an equitable division seeing that the landlord paid the whole of the landtax of 20$ to G-overnment. 11. With the introduction of the 'Istahlak' Law of 2 years ago the 'Iraq Government, I understand, laid it down that the fellah should get 44$ of the whole crop and the 'Mallak' 56$. The difference between each party's share being thus reduced from 20 to 12, because it was recognized thati that while the landlord would pay most of the ^Ashur' tax (10^ tax), the fellah would also sell a portion of his crop, and so would have to pay a certain amount of taxation also» 12 # For the Mutasarrif to calmly intimate that the Shaikh should settle with all his fellaheen on a fifty fifty basis (for this is apparently what he mean^), is not only contrary to the Law, but bears every sign of injustice, seeing that all other garden ov/ners from Q,urna to the sea work to-day on the 44/56 basis# 13 # You will, no doubt, have observed that the Muta sarrif has apparently made no attempt to have the matter settled by 'Tribal Majliss', which is the normal method of settling differences between owner and cultivator and for which official machinery exists• Nor has he suggested as another means of settling the trouble that the Shaikh might get rid of the troublesome half dozen 'Taab' tenants by the 'compensatory 1 method, for which also there is a re gular procedure* Instead he has championed those giving the trouble and has sowed the seed of discord among the contented cultivators by promising things they have no right to expect. Last but not least he has tied the Shaikhs hands by forbidding the sending of watchmen to guard the ripening dates, so as to prevent them being stolen by the fellaheen, a safeguard which is customary throughout the land and is the 'Mallaks' prerogative everywhere. 14, In actual fact this forbidding of watchmen is tantamount to telling the Shaikh that he had better accept the Mutasarrif* s decision quietly or have his dates stolen. The Shaikh recognizes this and is determined not to give way to the threat. He told me that for a day or two he thought of telegraphing to King Faisal and asking him to* to intervene but later resisted the temptation, as he felt His Majesty* s G-overnment were his rightful champions, and in the long run would see him through his troubles* 15» It is a significant fact, and one that one cannot shut ones eyes to, that there has never been any trouble between landlord and tenant (incidentally all are of Nejd origin, and are not Iraqis) on the Fao Estate, for six generations, and only when 'Iraq was recently given her independence and started casting covetous eyes on Kuwait, did the Shaikh ever experience any difficulty in the manage ment of his various properties on the Shatt al-Arab. Since then, however, and in three short years, the Shaikh has been 1 faced, in rapid succession, ?dth (a) demands that he should pay taxation on his exempted gardens (enforced); (b) ditto on produce exported for his own household use (enforced); (c) attacks on his Bashiyeh and Faddaghiyeh Estates; (d) unwarranted allegations regarding contraband running; and now finally with (e) this culminating trouble on his Fao Estate* 16• There can be no doubt at all, in my opinion, al- i though it may not be polite'to say so openly, that these attacks all form part of the carefully planned campaign of the new ♦Iraq Government, to force Kuwait to come under her control, and protection, by exerting pressure after pressure on the Shaikh, and at the same time by letting it be known 'under the cloak', as the Arabs call it, that all his troubles ' would cease if only he (the Shaikh) would surrender* The 1 Prime Minister of 'Iraq recently admitted as much to me in private conversation, although he put it in more parliament ary and subtle language. 17 # As His Majesty's aovernment is vitally interested that the Shaikh should not be deprived of any of his property in j.raq and still less lose legitimate revenue from them. v-I. I append below some figures which may be found of interest* They are, of course, approximate only* (a) Size of Fao Estate (b) Value © Rs-600/- per Jerib ## (c) Shaikhs annual income.

British Embassy, (159/59/33) Baghdad. 6th September 1953. My dear Dickson, ?adda^hly&amp;h Suit , Thank you very much for your letter No.190, of August 15th and for the copy of your letcer to Gabriel of August 25th. We agree entirely with the terms of the latter. If this case is heard, Gabriel must defend with all the weapons at his command, but, in view of certain assurances given in London by King Faisal, it: would be dangerous for him to take precipitate action. Thus, al though Gabriel may himself now be optimistic as to the result, it would still be better to keep the case out of court, altogether if we can. 7e are working on those lines here at present. All I can say just now is that there is no danger of hearing in the near future. 2. Incidentally, in your letter to the Political Resident No.177 of August 5th you misquote me in para graph 6. It is a small matter but is just worth while putting right. I said there was a danger of the Fadda- ghiyah case coming on for hearing on or after September 15th, not 'on or before ,, . ^ 3. Many thanks for getting the complete list of 00** heirs. Fortunately they are not as numerous as I feared they might be. 4. I hope to let you have a translation of the Power of Attorney in a few days. There was no one in the Office competent to translate it when it arrived and I could not take the risk of sending it out. Now Holt is back and he is having a shot at it. It is no easy document however, and he has many other pre-occupations. 5. ,1 7hether it will be necessary for me to visit Basra/&gt; - 2 - Basra depends upon the success of our efforts here to get the case struck off altogether. We will give you early notice of developments as they occur. In the meantime, perhaps it would be safer merely to tell the Shaikh that there is no immediate danger of a hearing. Yours sincerely, Sd.

The correspondence discusses changes in legislation proposed by the Government of Iraq regarding the collection of land rent and land produce duties, and the impact of these proposed changes to the ruler of Kuwait, Shaikh Aḥmad al-Jābir Āl Ṣabāḥ.In particular, the correspondence concerns the Government of Iraq's decision to end the immunity from taxation (on the gardens) that had been granted to the former ruler of Kuwait, Shaikh Mubārak Āl Ṣabāḥ and the Shaikh of Mohamerrah, Khaz‘al bin Jābir al-Ka‘bī by the British Government in return for their military support against the Ottoman Empire in World War 1.The correspondence discusses disturbances on the land owned by Shaikh Ahmad caused by his fellaheen (agricultural workers) allegedly refusing to pay rent, committing acts of sabotage and some of them demanding to be made proprietors of the land in place of the Shaikh. Within the correspondence, British officials discuss the Iraqi government's role in fostering the discontent and discuss the appropriate response with both Shaikh Aḥmad and the Government of Iraq.The file contains a Foreign Office memorandum that outlines the sequence of events regarding the Shaikhs' date gardens from 1914 until 1933 (ff 22-25).The file also contains details regarding a legal case brought against Shaikh Ahmad by members of the Al Zuhair family regarding the ownership of some of his land holdings in Iraq.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><topic>Land ownership</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0001ce#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
