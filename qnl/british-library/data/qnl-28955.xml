India’s letter of the 17th December t 1924 ; does not seem to suggest that these persons should receive documents showing them to be British subjects, but merely that they may be issued with British passports on which their status would be shown as British protected persons, as in 1 the case of subjects of Indian States. We are accordingly proposing to issue certificates in British protected person form, but, having regard to any political considerations that may be involved, we would be glad first to learn whether the India Office agree.

Sir, With reference to the correspondence on the above subject ending with your letter No.47/5-H/G.N. dated the 31st July 1933, T am directed by the High Commissioner for India to forward herewith copy of the marginally-noted —— , - , correspondence with Amin Sha. It will be seen To Amin Sha d/ 29*8.33 ) that Amin Sha cites the cases of three men from his yroip ' 30.8.33) district who are in possession of nationality certificates stating them to be British subjects. These three cases have been examined, and it is found that in one of them, that of Alim Shah, the question of national status was discussed at the India Office, and that a certificate in British subject form was issued by that Office, apparently based on Government of India letter No.bb-/, dated the 17th December 1924 (vide the Chief Commissioner*6 letter to the Government of India No.3633-P.N. dated the 26th July 1927), The India Office are not now able to trace that letter, and have suggested refer ence to you in this matter. They have suggested also that it is possible that the Government of India have given instructions that inhabitants of the tribal areas should for certain purposes be treated as if they were British subjects, although their real status appears to be that of British protected persons. The High Commissioner would accordingly be glad to receive your obser vations on this subject. 2 * w/n s Your refer enee in the case of Sherin Khan is letter NO *Tq/1qo’ d8ted the 4th Jul y 1930 and in the case of Shah Mohanmed letter No. 1923-P , dated the 4th February 1929. 10/100 I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, (Sd.)

In view of the instructions contained in the concluding paragraph of the Government of India letter I am to say that while there can be no question that Amin Sha is a British protected person and not a British subject there seems no reason why a special certificate of British nationality should not be issued to him.

Copy of a letter No. 56-?, dated the 17th December 1924, from the Deputy secretary to the Government India in the Foreign and Political Department, Delhi, to the Hon'ble the Chief Commissioner and Agent to the Governor General in the North-West Frontier Province. Subject:-Nationality of trans-frontier tribesmen under the political control of the Government of India. In reply to your letter No.QllQ/P, dated the 26th September 1924, I am directed to inform you that frontier tribesmen in areas outside British India but on the Indian side of the Durand line are not British subjects unless naturalised as such. In other words, they are not natural born British subjects under section 1 of the British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act, 1914, but aliens within the meaning of section 2 of that Act, and as such are susceptible of naturalisation. Equally they come, unless naturalised, within the definition of n foreigner M inserted in section 1 of the Foreigners Act,1864 by Act III of 1915 and are liable to deportation. But although foreigners for the purposes of municipal law, they are, as British protected persons, in the same position as British subjects from the point of view of international law, and as such are entitled to the recognition and protection accorded to British subjects in foreign countries, they are therefore entitled to receive ! passports.COPY t i m C °' ,y of a le ' tter No. 3633-P.N., dated the 26th nUly 1927, from the Chief Commissioner, N.W.F. Province to the Secretary to the Government of India, Department’ of Commerce, Subject:- Application of Alim Shah for the grant of a special certificate of British nationality. With reference to your letter No.606-S(19) dated the 15th June 1937, on the above subject, I have the honour to state that particulars mentioned in the form of application (returned herewith) which formed an enclosure to your letter have been verified. Alim Shah is a native of the village of Dheri Jolagram, Swat Ranizai, in the protected area of the Malakand Agency in this Province. In view of the instructions contained in paragraph 2 of the Government of India letter No.56-F, dated the 17th December 1924, there is no reason why a special certificate of British nationality should not be issued to Alim Shah.© IUDU office, WHITEHALL, 1. . ober # 1933# I am T©ry eorry not to have replied before to yoar letter of 25th 3er*teither.

In the case of Alim Shah (whose file is returned herewith) a certificate in British subject form was given on the basis of the statement of the Chief Commissioner , iorth fast rrentier Province# that his declaration had been verified.

I suppose that it will be necessary to ask the Government of India what those instructions were. It is possible that/ H.E.

Dear Walton^ 1955 ; ALDWYCH, LONDON, W.C.2. 25th September, 1933 In February 1930 an Indian seaman, Amen Sha, applied for a special certificate of nationality. The details were verified in the usual manner by reference to the local Government, and as the man came from Buner we issued a certificate in British protected person form in February 1931. In May of this year he wrote protesting that he was a British subject. We referred the question to the North west Frontier Province for a definite statement as to the man's national status, and were informed in reply that the man belonged to Bagrah in Buner in the Malakand Agency, and that he was a subject of the Wali of swat and a British protected person. Amen sha was informed accordingly, but has returned to the charge with the statement that three other men from the same district held certificates stating them to be British Subjects. We have looked up these oases, and find that in one of them, that of Alim shah, the question of national status was discussed in your Department and that a certificate in British subject form was issued apparently based on Government of India letter No. 56-F., dated the 17th December 1924. will you kindly say whether it is possible</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000466.0x000166_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/84</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000466.0x000166</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/84</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>PZ 6723/33 Nationality Status of People from Protected Areas of North-West Frontier Province</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1933/1934</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-10-18T12:22:54</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (9 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear
