No* C/710 Dated the 5th November 1939. I am rather concerned about the state of the Bahrain GovernmenV s *303 ammunition. They bought a tremendous lot in the last 18 months or so, but in the laudable desire to economise they got second hand stuff from a firm called the Soley Armament Company; and I am horrified now to find that all of it is 1917, 192J8 or 1919 vintage. Belgrave has fre quently assured me that it shoots very well from rifles, but we borrowed some the other day (for some range work for our Europeans who have been taught how to handle rifles) and the net result was — 25 % split vases* Cases which split at the shoulder only are all right so far as they go, but obviously they are quite useless for accurate shooting at anything but short range, end in a machine gun they are a positive menace. 2* I got about 6000 rounds the other day from the Air Officer Commanding, Habbnniyah, for Sharjah, and speaking pri vately I kept them here and sent some of the Bahrain stuff down to Sharjah. But now I find that even this is 13 years old and definitely not fit for use in machine guns. Do you think it would be any good asking the Government of India for a present of 100,000 rounds of really fresh ammunition ? I gather that Muscat is getting rifles and ammunition for nothing; and as Bahrain has at least given £ 30,000 to the common cause a small dollop of good ammunition would be a very suitable return* Eve if India would not make a present of 100,000 rounds perhaps they could give 50,000 and I would then Induce the Bahrain Government to buy the balance from them* I do not think it is worth while getting more since we do not want to perpetuate the Bahrain failure to turn over its ammunition within a reasonable period.

Reference your memorandum No. 2268/16 dated the 21st January 1940 on the above subject. 2. As I informed you verbally in September the attempt to obtain an additional supply of 600,000 rounds of ammunition for the Bahrain Government was abandoned in view of the shortage of supplies of really modern ammunition and of the fact that the Bahrain Government held considerable reserves. When it was ascertained that the Bahrain Government’s reserves were of ammunition dated 1917 - 1919 a fresh attempt was mnde to obtain new ammunition, but for obvious reasons the demand was reduced to 100,OCX) rounds in place of 600,000. The reduced quantity should provide for normal consumption, including consumption in machine guns, for a considerable period, and should also suffice in the highly improbable event I of some local attack. 3. There is considerable difficulty in obtaining ammuni tion of recent manufacture and an excessive demand would only defeat its own purpose. I hope to be able to inform you with out undue delay of the probable date of arrival of 100,000 rounds, which may conceivably be sent as a gift. Sti . f J - u • Political Agent, BahrainCONFIDENTIAL .

Sir ’ , /v I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to forward, fox the consideration of the Lords Commissioners of His 1/Jajesty’s Treasury, a copy of a letter from the Political Resident in the L Persian Gulf in which he submits a recommendation dated 18th November 1939) ' that 100,000 rounds of .303 ammunition should be presented by His hlajesty 1 s Government to the Bahrein Government. The Marquess of Zetland desires warmly to support this recommendation, which he feels would form a graceful act of recognition by His Majesty’s Government of the generous contribution spontaneously offered by His Highness the Sheikh of Bahrein towards the cost of the war. As the Resident states, no direct gift of arms or ammunition is being made to the Sheikh under the defence schemes for the Persian Gulf States prepared early last year by the Air Officer Commanding, Iraq, and although the disparity of financial conditions necessitates a different policy elsewhere, and notably in Muscat, Lord Zetland feels that it would be justifiable to give some smell measure of assistance to the Sheikh of Bahrein also in order to encourage him in the measures which he is taking to improve his defences. It is understood that the Ministry of Supply, who have been consulted, are prepared to authorise the release of the ammunition from the Government of India's stocks, and the price of the consignment, exclusive of packing and freight, is believed to be approximately only £600. In all the circumstances Lord Zetland hopes that Their Lordships may be moved at an early date to give their approval to the Resident's recommendation.

The principal correspondents in the file are the Political Agent in Bahrain (Hugh Weightman); the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (Lieutenant-Colonel Charles Geoffrey Prior).The file begins with a letter from the Political Agent to the Resident, dated 5 November 1939 (f 2), expressing concern that the Government of Bahrain’s recently acquired ammunition supplies are of First-World-War vintage, and not suitable for modern guns. The Political Agent asks if India might be persuaded to make a present of 100,000 rounds to Bahrain, given that ‘Muscat is getting rifles and ammunition for nothing’ and with the Government of Bahrain having given £30,000 to the British Government as a contribution towards the costs of the war. The remaining correspondence relates to this gift of 100,000 rounds, sent during 1940 in two consignments of 15,000 rounds and 85,000 rounds, in June and July respectively. A letter from the Political Agent to the Ruler of Bahrain, Shaikh Ḥamad bin ‘Īsá Āl Khalīfah, dated 1 April 1940, informing him of the gift (f 19), and Shaikh Ḥamad’s reply, dated 3 April 1940 (f 20) are included in the file.The file notes (f 44) indicate that the file contained correspondence up to October 1945, however the items of correspondence from 1945, as indicated in a note written in the margin of the file notes, were moved to file 4/25. As a result, the latest date of correspondence in the file is 25 January 1941.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Second World War (1939-1945)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Ammunition</topic></subject><subject><topic>Gifts</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x00002f#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
