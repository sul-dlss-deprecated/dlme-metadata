It may, therefore, kindly be stated Aether it is the intention that Lt. Col. Wightwick*s pay and allowances (including the cost of 6 single passages between Bombay and Aden representing a portion of his travelling allowance on transfer) commencing from the date on which he embarked for Aden at Bombay and ending on the date on which he disembarked at Bombay on histransfer from Aden only* should he charged to the Colonial Revenues* Ordinarily the cost of his pay and allowances (including Travelling Allowance on transfer for himself* family and personal effects* hothways) for the entire period from the date on which he made over charge of his old post on his transfer to Aden to the date on which he assumed charge of his new post on his retransfer from Aden* would seem to he chargeable to the Colonial Revenues* (b) It is presumed that the transfer of L.t* Burton from Sialkot to Aden on 14-12-33 and that of Major Rivett Camac from Aden to Duzdap on 4-2-34 respectively were not necessitated by the mission to Sanaa* These transfers have been treated by this office as ordinary transfers* the pay and allowances for the transit period of Lt* H* G* Burton alone being* as usual* divided between Indian and Colonial Revenues in the same proportion as the pay and allowances drawn by him after assuming the charge of the Office of the Personal Assistant to the Chief Commissioner* Aden.

We have now received a reply from Reilly, a copy Ox wnich I enclose. This seems to make it clear that Wightwick, for the period during which he acted, drew exactly the same pay and overseas allowance as Reilly draws,and that the proposed acting allowance of Rs.400 per month will be a clear addition to the former’s emoluments.

We told you that we would consult the Treasury further regarding the first two items of Head III of the Resident’s estimate.. We have now received a further despatch from Aden, a copy of which I enclose, dealing v/ith the allowances which it is suggested should be paid to Rivett-Carnac. Y/e have been in consultation with the India Office regarding the salary and allowances which should be paid to Wightwick and Rivett-Carnac during the period of“ Reilly’s absence at Sanaa. You will see that the proposal is that Rivett-Carnao, while acting as Political Secretary, should be paid his emoluments as Civil Secretary at the rate of Rs.1,633 per month. This is made up as follows: Rs.1,300 per month salary (= £1,170 per annum) and Rs.333 per month overseas allowance (= £300 per annum). The Acting Resident now proposes that, in addition to his pay and overseas allowance, he should receive the local duty allowance (£100 per annum) and conveyance allowance (£90 per annum) drawn by Champion. It seems to us reasonable that he should be paid Champion’s conveyance allowance, H.R. F0YL3, 3SQ,.Iallowance, as he will, no doubt, have done travelling in the irotectorate and would be out of pocket if he did not receive this. We would, therefore, propose that he should be allowed to draw it instead of Champion* (Champion, as you know, is receiving a special travelling allowance of Rs.7/8 (lls/3d) a day during the period of his absence from Aden)• As to the local duty allowance, the India Office are of opinion that this also should be paid to Rivett-Carnac even although his emoluments are higher than Champion’s, seeing that, as a matter of principle, the actual incumbent of the post should receive any local duty allowance attaching to it. If you agree to this also, then it would seem to be essential that for the period during which Champion will not draw his local allowance, he (Champion) should draw in lieu a special personal allowance of the same amount. It would, in our view, be unfair to deprive Champion of the equivalent of his duty allowance during this period, seeing that he has been on special important work at Sanaa. Rivett-Carnac left Aden on transfer on the 4th February and Hickinbotham has acted temporarily as Political Secretary until lake resumed duty about the 11th February. We would propose that Hickinbotham also during this short period should draw Champion’s conveyance allowance and duty allowance. No question arises as from the date Lake takes over the duties as he is already in receipt, as Political Ofticer, of a local allowance (£180 per annum) and consolidated travelling allowance (£225 per annum), and his pay and personal allowance (£972 per annum) are higher than Champion’s pay.. The31 The estimated cost of the above proposals is shewn on the enclosed statement. As to Wightwick, the India Office are unable to explain how the pay at the rate of Rs.2,916 per month is made up, and they propose to enquire on this point from the Government of India. We shall of course be liable in any case for refund of his substantive pay. As to the acting allowance of Rs.400 per month, they say that it is the normal Indian practice to pay acting allowances, even for short periods, ?ind they therefore think that the acting allowance should be sanctioned. It will be remembered that an acting allowance has been paid in the past when the Civil Secretary has acted for the Resident. Moreover, Wightwick has had all the inconvenience of having to come from India at short notice for this special duty, and we hope, therefore, that you will not raise any objection. The India Office also propose that leave pension and passage fund contributions should be claimed for the period concerned. In the case of Wightwick this should amount to about £14£ and of Rivett-Carnac and Hickinbotham to £75 for the periods mentioned in the estimate but these figures will have to be somewhat increased as we now know that the mission has been absent from Aden for about two months. They reached Aden on the 17th February. Everything will now be clear if you are prepared to agree to the proposals set out above- In order that we may now get the matter settled as soon as possible, I should be grateful for an early reply.

As I understand the position what your Vote is called upon to bear regarding these so called 'acting' appointments, is the cost to India at Aden of puttingup substitutes for each of these two officers. You propose to pay the whole of Rivett-Carnac*s emoluments. That doean f t seem to me to be right. India would have had to pay him if he hadn ! t substituted for Champion. It seems to me that what you ought to pay is the cost to India of providing a substitute for Rivett-Carnac. In other words in spite of the two-fold incidence of the cost of the staff at Aden the United Kingdom and India establishment there is so interwoven that only the net cost of substitution should be paid. Apart from this, while I agree that the Conveyance allowance may be transferred from Champion to Rivett-Carnac I see no reason at all why the latter should draw the former's Local Allowance. There is a history behind the allowance. It was given to Champion because it was found that he was rather badly off upon transfer from Palestine. Anyhow, Rivett-Carnac f s emoluments are already K.W. Blaxter, Esq., Colonial Office.&lt;= r already in excess of those of the post in which he was substituting. To add to them doesn T t seem to me to be reasonable. Ought not the acting allowance of Rs.400 per month proposed for Wightwick to be restricted, if necessary, to the amount sufficient to bring his total emoluments up to those of Reilly, excluding the latter T s Sumptuary Allowance.. I agree to payments of leave, pension and passage fund contributions for Wightwick and (?)Hickinbotham.

We note that, subject to Treasury concurrence, you agree to accept our claims for leave, passage and pension contributions in respect of Wightwick and Rivett-Carnac. With regard- ^ 3 -'?he acting allowance proposed for Wightwick, Ih-rs is in accordance with Indian practice and should, we think, be granted in this case. 3. As for Wightwick’s proposal that Rivett-Carnac should draw the duty allowance drawn by Champion as Civil Secretary, we should agree entirely with you if that allowance ics- classed as personal (either to Champion individually # oi^ in view of the rate of pay attaching to the post^ ♦&lt; to successive Colonial Service incumbents). But that does not appear to have been the view taxen of it in the pasVsee Jameson 1 s letter to Crombie, No.97863/32, of the 17th September 1932 and fex Howard 1 s letter to Foyle of even number dated 22nd August 1932.^) From that correspondence it would appear that the duty allowance of £100 per annum is really in the nature of a/a marriage allowance, is attached to the post and would he granted to a married Indian Service officer if he held the post on an officiating basis. In these circumstances we consider that Rivett-Carnac (who is married) is entitled to receive the allowance. But we might have a talk about this youj^think that it would help. If it i a-agreed LTiat . e if 4 substantive allowance should go to Rivett-Garnac while he officiates, the question what arrangements in regard to it should be made in the case of Champion during the period of his deputation would have to be considered p^paratel y. The conveyance allowance is in our view in a different position. This appears to be in the nature of a compensatory allowance in respect of certain specific liabilities incurred by the holder of the post: there can be no question of these liabilities being discharged by Champion while he is on special duty at Sanaa, and in our view this allowance should (pemade available for Rivett-Carnac during the period of his officiating service.

February, 1934. \ \ kV k My dear Laithwaite, Thank you for your letter No.P.Z.8254/33 of the 22nd January about the incidence of cost of the emoluments of those officers who are affected by the absence from Aden of Reilly and Champion while at Sanaa. Subject to Treasury concurrence, we agree to meet claims in respect of leave, pension and passage fund contributions in the case of Wightwick and Rivett-Carnac. The question of acting allowances has now been raised. Foyle of the Treasury recently asked me about the acting allowance of Rs.400 a month which Reilly has proposed for Wightwick. Foyle points out t^.at in the Home Civil Service the Treasury would not sanction an — acting 1 i ■ I rrx J. G.LAITHWAITE,ESQ,. , 1. 7 -F - 1 . 1934 IND’A CEacting allowance for so short a period, it being understood that officers must act for others for short periods without extra remuneration; but if it is the normal Indian practice to pay an acting allowance even for a short period, I think the Treasury may be prepared to agree. Would you kindly let me know what the Indian practice in such matters is? An acting allowance has been paid in the past when the Civil Secretary has acted for the Resident. I enclose a copy of a despatch which has been __ received *rom Aden about acting allowances for Rivett-Carnac. Rivett-Carnac*s present emoluments apparently amount to approximately £1470 per annum or £15b0 per annum if the compensatory allowance is included. Champion’s total emoluments including duty allowance and conveyance allowance amount to £1090 per annum. The duty allowance was granted in Champion’s case largely because of hip comparatively low rate of salary. In these circumstances, we do not feel that there is any case for giving Rivett-Carnac any additional allowances,and we doubt very» *°l very much whether the Treasury would be prepared to agree. (Wightwick’s case seems to us to be rather different seeing that he has had the inconvenience of coming specially to Aden), Moreover the allowances cannot be considered as available for the officer acting in the post on the grounds that they are not being drawn by anyone else as of course Champion is still continuing to draw them. If you agree we would propose to reply to the despatch saying that we cannot agree to the Acting Resident *3 proposal. It would be a good thing I think if we could now get the final emoluments payable to Wightwick and Rivett-Carnac during this period settled as soon as possible. Perhaps therefore you would be prepared to consult the Government of India by telegraph.

Sir, With reference to the letter from this Department of the 20th of December, regarding the visit of the Resident at Aden to Sanaa, I am directed by Secretary Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister to request you to lay before the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury a copy of a further despatch from the Resident proposing an increased rate of daily allowance in the case of the British Officer, Aden Protectorate Levies, attached to the Mission, Their Lordships will observe that the rate now proposed (Rs.7,8 a day) will place the officer on a equality with the Political Secretary, The rate suggested in the case of the Political Secretary (Rs.7.8 a day) is that approved in Treasury letter (E.19172/2) of 21st of August 1929. I am to request that their Lordships may be moved to approve of the increased rate now proposed in the case of the British Officer, Aden Protectorate Levies. I am, etc., (Sgd.) H.R. COWELL.

Sir, I have the honour to refer to my despatch No. 274 of the 15th November 1933, regarding tne estimate of the cost of the Mission to San*a. 2. I informed you therein that the provision made for daily allowances to the members of the Mission had been based on, or on the analogy of Indian rates, and the allowance proposed for the British Officer, Aden Protectorate Levies, (item I), at Rs.4/- per diem was calculated on that basis. 3. It has since been ascertained that the detention allowance for this officer, calculated on Air Ministry rates such as are allowed to R.A.E. Intelligence Officer of equivalent rank who tour in the Aden Protectorate, would approximate to Rs. 13/- per diem; and in these circumstances I propose, subject to your approval, to grant to him, by way of compromise, a daily allowance of Rs.7/8- per diem during the period of his special duty with the Mission.

Subject to tie acceptance by His Lajesty 1 s Government of liability for leave, pension ana passage fund contributions in the case of the Acting Resident and Acting Political Secretary, the proposals now made by the Colonial Office in their letter of 20th December (P.Z.8203/33) in respect of the incidence of the cost of the emoluments of the officers affected by the Sanaa deputation a re regarded as satisfactory. The proposals are based on the principle that, since the expenditure is wholly political in character^Inaia shoula not in | any circumstances be involved in extra direct expenditure owing to the Sanaa negotiations and shoula merely be liable for her normal contribution of 1/3rd of political emd military expenditure. agreement with us as soon as possible and^ in the circumstances explained above^the Financial Department agree that it is unnecessary to consult the Government of India on the question of principle. When the Colonial Office have accepted our proposal as regards leave, pension ana passage funa contributions we can inform the Government of India of the arrangements and take up with them the details of the figures involved.

I discussed this yesterday with Mr.Janes and Mr. Cleary, who suggested that we should ask the Colonial Office for Leave, Pension and Leave Passage ccntributions, The further suggestion of Mr.Janes that the cost of sending Captain Hickinbotham to Aden might possibly be considered an extra charge (i.e. necessitated by the Sanaa deputation) which should fall on His Majesty's Government is hardly reasonable. Captain Hickinbotham will act as Civil Secretary for iid. Rivett-Carnac while the latter acts as Political Secretary for Mr. Champion, but he has already been acting for some weeks as Personal Assistant at Aden and there is quite a possibility that he may be posted * permanently as Civil Secretary, Rivett-Carnac being transferred elsewhere. Another argument against charging His Majesty's Government with the cost of Captain y* Hickinbotham's passage is that the Colonial Office originally intended to suggest thap since Captain Hickinbotham is junior the cost of the Civil Secretaryship was being lessened to India's advantage and that this ought to be taken into account in determining the incidence of/ UDraft Paper.

Subject to the points referred to below the estimate appears to be prepared on a correct basis. (a) The Resident estimates that he will be absent from Aden for six weeks. If, horever, the negotiations with the Imam continue for a longer period, the estimate will have to be increased to correspond with the additional period of the Resident’s absence.

As regards the inciarnce of charge of the acting appointments (i.e.the extent to which each appointment is to be re arded as directly necessitated by the despatch of the mission', far Philip Gunliffe- Lister has not yet reached agreement with the Fecretary of State for India on tho matter and a copy of a semi-official letter which is being addressed to the India Office on the question is enclosed herewith. 3.t A ■m, 3.

Idr' )1S / In reply to your letter of the 13th November (p.Z.6996/33) we have been considering your proposals regarding the incidence of charge of the emoluments of those officers who are affected by the absence from Aden of Reilly and Champion whilst at Sanaa, and we agree with the principle that the cost of any • consequential staff changes should be charged wholly to United Kingdom funds subject to the usual contribution by the Government of India towards the cost of political services at Aden. We have, however, certain alternative proposals to make as to details. 17e are, in fact, in favour of the proposals made by Reilly in the estimate of the cost of the mission which he has submitted to us. Our views, therefore, are (a) that for this purpose Reilly should be regarded COPY SENT BY Al J.G.LAITHWAITS.ESQ. ^ MAIL A ENCLOSURE IN WEEKLY No. 5 II AE&amp;.193* FROM ? CRETAKY, POLITI SEC rET DEPT. INDIA 0 . .V ' * -vx as continuing to be Resident even though absent from Aden and that no change should be made in the present allocation of his emoluments between United Kingdom and Indian funds. Reilly, in his estimate, does not propose any change. There is in this connexion the point that the charging of the whole of his emoluments to United Kingdom funds would increase his United Kingdom Income Tax Assessment - a position we all, I think, wish to avoid. (b) that the whole of Y/ightwic^s emoluments and his passage expenses shallberecovered from United Kingdom funds. Reilly has so provided in his estimate. I do not think that in the circumstances any liability to assessment to United Kingdom Income Tax should arise, as India will continue to pay his salary and the appointment is only a temporary acting one. (c) that the whole of Rivett Oarna^s emoluments should be recovered from United Kingdom funds. As rI As in the case of Wightwick no Income Tax question should arise. The financial effect of the two alternative schemes is set out in the enclosed statement so far as we have been able to ascertain the emoluments of the officers concerned. Perhaps you will let me know whether you are prepared to accept the alternative proposals made in this letter. A copy of your letter of the 13th November and this reply is being sent to the Treasury with the Resident's estimate under cover of an official letter, and a copy of that letter and the estimate is being sent officially to the India Office. &gt;M/a</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000013_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/1483</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000013</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/1483</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 1/47 'Aden.
