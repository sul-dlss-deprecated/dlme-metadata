The correspondence is mostly between the Government of India, Foreign Office, and India Office. Further correspondence, included as enclosures and often in the form of printed collections relating to the matter at hand, is between the Government of India, Foreign Office, and various British political and diplomatic offices in Persia, Turkish Arabia (present-day Iraq), and the Persian Gulf.The three parts of the volume each relate to different subjects, as follows:1. (Part 3) The arrangements for Turkish mail from Basra to be conveyed to ports in the Persian Gulf;2. (Part 4) Cargo landing arrangements at Bahrain and the discussion over whether to support a German firm's claim of mis-management against the current contractor;3. (Part 5) Outbreaks of plague and cholera in the region.Many of the discussions covered by the papers bring into question the nature of Britain's role in Bahrain, particularly regarding jurisdiction over foreigners.The volume comprises parts 3-5 of 5. Each part includes a divider which gives the subject and part numbers, year the subject file was opened, subject heading, and list of correspondence references contained in that part by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>India Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Bahrain</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Colonial administration</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000365.0x0003a8#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
