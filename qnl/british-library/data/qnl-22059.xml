ResidentNote on the heath of His Highness Shaikh Sir Hamad bin Isa Alkhallfah, and the succession of His Highness Jhaikh Salman bin Hamad Alkhalifah. For several years Shaikh Hamad had been in poor health* When he was in London in 1936 he visited the leading medical authority on diabetes and had a course of treatment and was recommended a diet and regular doses of insulin* After his return to Bahrain he was treated by Dr* R* Holmes and later by the State Medical Officer, Dr. R.H.B.onow. An Indian dresser from the government hospital was allotted to him and was in attendance wherever Shaikh Hamad was living* The insulin treatment was carried out un* oeasingly but in spite of incessant warnings, requests and reminders from his medical attendants, his rela tions, servants and myself Shaikh Hamad practically ignored the rules of his diet which had been laid down* One of his few concessions in the matter of diet was abstention from sweet tea, which he had never liked, and from sweets and sweet cakes on public occasions* He continued recklessly to eat quantities of rice and dates, especially during the fresh date season* He used to be a very light eater but towards the end of his life he ate heavily* In consequence of this it became necessary to increase the quantity of insulin which was given to him until at the end he was receiving abnormally large doses* About two years ago - it is difficult to decide any actual date - it became notice able that Shaikh Hamad had become very stiff on his left side, both his arm and his leg being affected* It was for this reason that he found it comfortable to use the small armed- chairs which he kept in the palaceat Man amah and at Sakhir. He used to lever himself with both arms whan rising from the chair* He never discussed this matter but it was commented on by his servants* After he died his household servants said that twice before he had attacks which reduced him to a state of unconsciousness for a short time but these incidents were not made public at the time and consi derable vagueness exists as to their dates* Chi the whole 9 considering his physical liabilities hia general health had been well maintained* His heart however always required careful watohing 9 and during the last six months Its condition had been slowly and insidiously showing signs of strain* On Monday 16th February 1942 the annual celebra tion of the anniversary of Shaikh Hamad 9 s accession day was held 9 owing to the war the only public event was a ceremonial parade of the state forces In front of the palace* On the previous day Shaikh Hamad discuased the programme with me and said that as he found that walking tired him so much he did not intend to pass down the lines but would remain seated throughout the parade* He had been suffering for some days from a swollen rheumatic ankle and though Dr* Snow and I per sonally asked him to keep his leg resting on a chair he neglected the advice and twice during the few days before the parade I found him sitting in the gate room at Sakhir not resting his leg* The parade was held on Monday 16th* Various people commented on the fact that Shaikh Hamad did not look well* When it was over he drove back to Rumaitha where he was staying for some days in order to enjoy the results of the recent rain* Rumaitha is a little valley in the high country towards the south end ofthe island, here during recent years Shaikh Hamad built a small hunting lodge, a mosque and some out houses and spent much of his time. Dr. Snow visited Shaikh Hamad on Tuesday afternoon and found him in good spirits and with no unusual symptoms. On the same evening at about 8-50 Shaikh Hamad had a stroke. He was praying in his house and one of his personal servants was present when he fell on his side, unconscious. The man summoned the other servants and they managed to lay him down comfortably. Hone of the relations were present. Messengers were sent in for Dr. Snow and Dr. Holmes, who happened to be staying in Bahrain and for Shaikh Hamad*s sons and brothers. When I heard the news, next morning, I went out to Ruaaitha. I found Shaikhs Mohomed, Abdullah and Salman in the outer room with some of the sons and great many of the family outside the house. I stayed there most of the morning and made certain arrangements about additional guards on the room in Sakhir where Shaikh Hamad kept a very large amount of silver and gold. Before I left I saw Shaikh Hamad who was in a state of coma. During Wednesday and Thursday and until he died shortly after midday on Friday Dr. Snow, Dr. Holmes and Dr. Harrison took turns on duty at Rumaltha. During most of the time the sons end brothers were present but when he actually died none of them were there. un Thursday evening Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa cams to see me and discussed the possibility of Shaikh Hamad recovering. nothing of a political nature was mentionsd. On Friday at about 1 p.m. I received a telephone message from Dr. Holmes at Awali telling me that Shaikh Hamad was dead. I informed the AgencyI and went to Ruroaitha talcing my sacrotary Mr. Narayan. Before going 1 gave orders for all flags to ba flown at half mast In order that the public should know what had happened, I stopped on the way at Shaikh Salman 9 s house at Rafaa, he had gone to Rumaltha but the news was not known there, A little distance from Ruaaitha I met a long pro cession of about 60 cars with the Bahrain Petroleum Company 9 s ambulance in the centre, I turned off the road. The leading car and the whole procession stopped and Shaikhs Mohoated, Abdullah and Salman got out and had a conversation with me on the roadside, Shaikh Mohomed was the spokesman and he told me that he wished me to know at once that the family had chosen Shaikh Salman to succeed his father and now they were taking Shaikh Hamad to the cemetery at Rafaa, They asked me to follow their car. All along the road the proces sion was joined by care which had been going out to Rumaitha, The procession turned off the main road across the desert to the little cemetery near the Hanaini well in the valley below Rafaa, Shaikh Abdul la tif, one of the Sunni ' afl waiting here with a great crowd of people, all the inhabitants of the two Rafaas. On the cliffs below the fort there were many hundreds of women. The service was taken by Shaikh Abdullatif, Shaikh Hamad was buried close to the grave of Shaikh Salman bin Ahmad who was the second ruler of Bahrain and who lived early in the 19th century. Among the large crowd of people who were present were Dr. Snow and Dr. Harrison, Arabs. After the funeral the way 1 met several cars Jews, Indians, Persians and I returned to Man amah. On full of people driving out to -—5- to Hafaa among them Shaikh Khalifah oin Saiman, Shaikh Hamad's naphaw, son of an older brother, who was vary angry and upset at not having boon told the time and place of the funeral. Hearing that large crowds had collected at the Muharraq and Manamah cemeteries I telephoned to the police, from Rafaa, giving orders that people were to be told that the funeral had taken place. On the same night, at about Q p.ra. I took the document which Shaikh Hamad had written appointing Shaikh Salman as his successor from the safe custody of the Eastern Bank and went to see Shaikh Salman at Rafaa. I had a private conversation with him and delivered the document which he read. He said he had heard something about a document being written by his father but he did not know what it was about. He then told me that on the previous night Shaikh Abdullah came to see him alone and had said that if Shaikh Hamad died Shaikh Salman should succeed him and he would support Shaikh Salman. Shaikh Salman said he had at first refused the suggestion but after discussion he had been prevailed upon to agree on con* dition that all the family supported him. He also described Uow after Ills father's death, at Rumaitha, Shaikhs Motcmed and Abdullah took him aside and told him that he should now become Shaikh and that they would support him, they promised to be loyal to him and behave towards him in whe same way a© they had to his father. They then returned to the other sons and the relations who were present and Jhaikn Mohamad told the family that Shaikh Salman was now Shaikh and asked whether anybody had any objection. The other brothers -- 6 - brothers ttnd the cousinfi unanimously signified their consent* They then mounted their care and drove to the oeiaetary. Shaikh Salman appeared to be pleased and re lieved to find that Shaikh Hamad had appointed him as his successor. He spoke for a long time about his duties and his responsibilities which, he said, consisted of three chief obligations, to protect and preserve the righto of the Ruling Family, to look after the interests of hia people with fairness and justice and to preserve the friendship with the British Government* He said he had told his uncles and brothers that he would undertake these three chief duties* He said he wished everything to continue as it had in his father^ time and did not want any changes made. Regarding the document Itself he said ho would like his two uncles to seal it, showing their approval and would also like it signed by the Political Agent, perhaps after his unolea had signed it* He ^ said neither they nor anybody else had any knowledge of this document although some knew that a document about something had been signed by the late Ruler* Shaikh Salman spoke of my service to his father and said that he wished me to remain with him in the same capacity as I held with Shaikh Hamad* On the following day the Shaikhs remained in their houses receiving visits of condolence. On Sunday Shaikhs Salman, Hohomed and Abdullah came to the Advisenate. Shaikh Mohomed arrived first and told me again what Shaikh Salman had told me on the previous night, he emphasized that the family were unanimous in wanting Shaikh Salman and he thoughthe was the best, if he had had any doubts he would not have hesitated to make them known. He reminded me that he had told me sometime ago that he himself had never aspired to be Shaikh. He did not remind me that at about that time he told me that he thought Shaikh Abdullah should be the successor. Shaikh Abdullah and Shaikh Saimaa came later, there was a good deal of talk about the Ruler 9 s duties towards the family. They told me that they had decided that Shaikh Hamad should be burled at Rafaa because most of the family were buried there. They discussed the document and the uncles said that they had both sealed it and they spoke a good deal about carrying out the wishes of Shaikh Hamad. All three asked me to remain as Adviser. After returning from the Agency they drafted a number of replies to telegrams and I suggested that it was desirable that some sort of proclamation should be published in order to let everyone know that Shaikh Salman had succeeded his father. A proclamation was then drafted, written by Shaikh Mohoned who suggested adding to it the sentence about the British Government which they all agreed upon. The proclamation was based upon the gist of the document which Shaikh Hamad signed and the wording in this was copied almost ver batim from the document in which Shaikh Isa appointed Shaikh Hamad as Heir Apparent over forty years ago. The matter of the estate, which is large and affec ted by family custom, was not touched upon. Shaikh Abdullah reminded Shaikh Salman that he would have to give up his seat as President of the Muharraq Municipality and as President of the Pinors 9 Department. It was agreedagreed that we should meet again on Thursday. At present public opinion is generally in favour of Shaikh Salman, who, it is thought, is the best choice anong the family but unlikely to acquire the affection in which his father was held. He is not and never has been liked by his brothers, who are mostly very much younger than him. *&lt;hen the fact was first known there was consternation in the house holds of many of the Shaikhs but since then Shaikh Salman has seen or sent messages to a number of re lations and people who were dependent upon his father promising to look after them. Shaikh Mo homed and Shaikh Abdullah, especially the former, have let it be seen very clearly that they do not contemplate any withdrawal from the control of the State. I think this is a good thing. Actually for several years the two uncles and Shaikh Salman and myself have constituted a sort of unofficial State Council for dealing with all matters of importance which were invariably handed over to us for consideration by Shaikh Hamad. The matter over which there may be friction is Shaikh Hamad’s estate and Shaikh Salman’s administration of his J&gt;rivy Purse. A certain faction mostly in Muharraq including some local merchants and younger members of the Ruling Family also most of the ’’Shubban’ 1 (young men ) are extremely disappointed that Shaikh Abdullah did not become Ruler. The Bahama are intensely relieved that neither Shaikh Mahomed nor Shaikh Abdullah have come into power. There was an idea current mainly among the Bahama that Shaikh Hamad would be the last Khallfah Ruler and that after him the British would take -take over Bahrain* Apparently the Bahama viewed this prospect with equanimity* On the whole the Bahama are glad that Shaikh Salman has succeeded partly because they feared and disliked so much the prospect of being ruled by either of his uncles* The Bahama have never liked the Ruling Family for religious and political reasons but they were fond of Shaikh Hamad who always treated them well and granted them many privileges which they had not enjoyed before* Ouring Shaikh Hamad’s illness there was much conjecture as to who would succeed him* The chances of Shaikhs Mohomed t Abdullah, Salman and Daij were discussed, the last was well known to be his father’s favourite son and has the reputation of having something of his father’s disposition. Shaikh Salman’s popularity will depend much upon his treatment of the family and the people* One of the things which caused general irritation was Shaikh Hamad’s lavish generosity to foreign Arabs, Bedouin and ^attaris. Shaikh Salman never sympathised with this and it is possible that he will discontinue Adviser to the Government, Adviserate, February 26, 1942*Confidential D.O.

I have already (three days ago) conveyed to Shaikh Salman the news of the recognition of his succession by His Majesty’s Government, and your congratulations and good wishes. A message of condolence from His Majesty's Government delivered at this stage would - whatever accompanying explanation were given - be puzzling to the Shaikh, and liable to misinterpretation on his part. 3. The Shaikh assumes that my visit of condolence, paid on the day following Shaikh Hamad's death, was made by me in my representative, rather than in my personal capacity? and this fact would render even more puzzling to him the delivery of a message of condolence now. 4.

S 6 MFP—400S&amp;P—(M-480 — 26-7-34—2,00,000.Confidential &gt; No.C/308* The Agency, Bahrain, the 13th March 1942. Prom B.B.Wakefield Esquire, I.C.S., Political Agent, Bahrain. To The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Camp, Bahrain. Sir, I have the honour to submit a report on the death of His Highness Shaikh Sir Hamad bin f Isa al •^hsxifah, N.C.X.E., C.S.X., Ruler of Bahrain, and the succession of his eldest son, His Highness Shaikh Salman bln Hamad al Khalifah. 2. The last occasion on which I saw Shaikh Hamad was on the 16th February, 1942, when a ceremonial parade of the State Forces was held in front of the Palace at Manamah to mark the tenth anniversary of his accession, had X had also/an interview with the Shaikh on the 15th February when we discussed in some detail the war situ ation, with particular reference to the Impending fall of Singapore. It seemed to me, on both these occasions that His Highness' general health was not good and that the Improvement which followed his hawking expedition in Saudi Arabia earlier in the winter had not been maintained.3* On the 17th Febmary I left Bahrain by air for a week's tour of the Truclal Coast. On the afternoon of February 19th, on my return to Sharjah from Abu Dhabi, I found awaiting me a telegram from Mr .Jackson, Assistant Political Agent, Bahrain, informing me that Shaikh Hanad had had a stroke on February 17th and had not, by the afternoon of February 18th (when the telegram was des patched), recovered consciousness. By the courtesy of Squadron Leader Newall, Officer Commanding, R.A.F. Station, Sharjah, I was enabled to return to Bahrain on the morning of February 20th in a service aeroplane; and I actually arrived at Bahrain about a quarter of an hour after His Highness Shaikh Hamad had died. 4# It appears that after the ceremonial parade on the afternoon of February 16th His Highness Shaikh Hamad had driven out to his country house at Rumaithr. At 8.30 p.m. on the following day, February 17th, he had a stroke while he was saying his prayers, and fell on his side, unconscious Near relatives and doctors were at once summoned. Dr.Snow (State Medical Officer), Dr. Holmes (Residency Surgeon) and Dr. Harrison (American Mission) attended the Shaikh and one of them was always with him untifc, without having re covered consciousness, he eventually died at about 12.16 p.m on Friday, February 20th. At the time of his death only Dr. Holmes and one or two servants were present. Members of the family had left the house a little earlier to take their mid-day meal. The funeral was held the same after noon, the burla). taking place at the cemetery at Rafa v • Shaikh Hamad's age at the time of his death is not known exactly. it is believed, however, that he was in his seventieth year. Those who sent telegrams of condolence included the Kings of Egypt, Iraq and Saudi Arabia, Her Royal Highness Princess Alice and the Bari of Athlone, His Majesty's Government and His Excellency the Viceroy e5© It had been expected that when Shaikh Hamad died the succession would be disputed* In fact, however, Shaikh Salman assumed the reins of government with the unanimous consent of the Khalifah family and without objection on the part of any class of his subjects. The transition from one rule to another has, indeed, been so peaceful, so free from the displays of partisan spirit which normally mark such occasions in Arab Shaikhdoms, that it may be of interest to record in some detail the steps by which it was accom plished* 6© On the evening of February 19th, while Shaikh Hamad was still lying in a state of c oma, Shaikh Abdullah paid a private visit to Shaikh Salman* Shaikh Abdullah, it will be recalled, is the younger of Shaikh Salman's two uncles and had been commonly regarded as Shaikh Sal man's most dangerous rival in a disputed succession. Shaikh Abdullah, in the course of his interview with Shaikh Salman, urged that he, Shaikh Salman, should succeed Shaikh Hamad if Shaikh Hamad did not recover from his stroke; and he promised his full support to Shaikh Salman. After discussion Shaikh Salman agreed to take his father*s place on condition that all the family supported him. It is not known whether Shaikh Mohammad (Shaikh Salman* s elder uncle) was privy to Shaikh Abdullah’s overtures before they were made, but immediately after Shaikh Hamad's death, when the family collected at Fumaitha, Shaikhs Mohammad and Abdullah took Shaikh Salman aside and told him that they regarded him as the natural successor of Shaikh Hamad and that they would support him loyally in the same way as they had supported his father. The three Shaikhs then rejoined the other members of the family who were present and Shaikh Mohammad, announcing that Shaikh Salman would succeed Shaikh Hamad, asked whether any one had any objection/ 8. The members of the family, seeing that Shaikh Salman had the support of his Wo uncles (the most influential and respected members of the Khalifah family), unanimously signified their acceptance of Shaikh Salman. 7. In the late afternoon of February 20th Mr.Belgrave informed me that the Khalifah family had chosen Shaikh Salman to succeed his father. I did not know at that time what part Shaikh Abdullah had played in the s^elaction of Shaikh Salman, nor had I reason to suppose that any of the Khalifah family knew the contents of Shaikh Hamad*s testament appoint- Shaikh Salman to succeed him. It seemed to me that Shaikh Salman had already gone a considerable way to estab lishing himself in his father's place and that, if the con tents of Shaikh Hamad's testament were known, Shaikh Salman% position would become secure against any possible rival. I therefore asked Mr.Belgrave to secure Shaikh Hamad's testa ment from the local branch of the Eastern Bank, where it was lying in safe custody, and to take it to Shaikh Salman immediately. Some difficulty was experienced in obtaining from the Bank the sealed envelope containing Shaikh Haaad's testament but eventually Mr.Belgrave secured the envelope and, having arranged a private interview with Shaikh Salman, delivered it to him at 3 p.m. Shaikh Salman was both pleased and relieve^ to find that his father had appointed him his successor. He said that neither he nor any other member of the family had any knowledge of Shaikh Hamad's testament although one or two people knew that Shaikh Hamad had on one occasion signed an important document. He said that he would try to get his two uncles to endorse the docuflient in token of their acceptance of its contents and that he would also like it to be signed 'by the Political Agent.- 5 - Y* 8. On the morning of February 21st I paid the customary visits of condolence, first to Shaikh Salman, then to Shaikh Mohammad, then to Shaikh Abdullah, and finally to Shaikh Rashid bin Mohammad, father-in-law of the late Buler. The order in which these visits were paid was taken, no doubt, to be an indication of the attitude which His Majesty’s Government were likely to adopt towards the succession: But in my conversations with the Shaikhs X strictly avoided any reference, direct or indirect, to that subject. When I arrived at Rafa 1 to call on Shaikh Salman he Introduced me to his seven brothers. In the course of our conversation, which was mostly about Shaikh Hamad and his many fine qualities, Shaikh Salman expreSvSed his determination to follow as closely as possible in his father’s footsteps. In par ticular, and in an emphatic manner, he gave an under taking that he and his brothers would always be friendly and faithful to the British Government. During my call on Shaikh Mohammad he told me that he would give his full support to Shaikh Salman whom he now regarded as the Head of the Family. Neither Shaikh Abdullah nor Shaikh Rashid made any reference to Shaikh Salman and his new position. 9. On the morning of the 22nd February Shaikh Sal man and his two uncles, accompanied by Mr.Belgrave, came to see me at the Agency. I met Shaikh Salman, who walked ahead of the others, at the place at which the Political Agent normally receives the Ruler of Bahrain; but in my conversation I avoided the use of honorifics to which only the Buler of Bahrain is entitled. After the usual preliminary courtesies Shaikh Salman gave me formal intimation that his family had unanimously selected him to succeed his father. Shaikhs Mohammad and Abdullah / confirmedconfirmed this and added that nowhere in Bahrain, either among the Khalifah family or among the populace, was there a single dissentient voice* Shaikh Salman then informed me that he had set before himself three main objectives* These were s- (1) Loyally to preserve the existing ties of friendship with the British Government; (2) To respect the rights both of members of his family and of his individual subjects; and (3) To promote the public welfare by all means in his power* He expressed his determination to be loyal to the British connection and to implement all undertakings given by the previous Rulers of Bahrain: and he spontaneously offered to be guided by any advice which the Political Agent might ten der to him. In reply I expressed pleasure at hearing his declaration of friendship and loyalty; and I promised that, for my part, I would always deal with him frankly and openly so that nothing would be hidden between us and there could never be any mis under standing; and I further told him that -f. r o I would report at once to the Honourable the Resident in the Persian Gulf the sentiments that he had expressed to me and the fact that his succession had the unanimous support of his family and people. Before taking his leave Shaikh Salman told Ate in detail of his fathers last hours, and praised the devotion of the doctors who attended him. He also ex pressed his gratitude for the help which Mr.Belgrave had given to his father in the past and was now giving to him. 1C. In the afternoon of February 22nd Shaikh Salman issued a proclamation announcing that he had 'taken over the rule of Bahrain' in accordance with the wish and behest of / Shaikh- 7 - c°(&amp; b Shaikh Hamad and with the approval of his ancles, his brothers and of nis tribe• The Proclamation contained the following words t- 11 I shall continue to strengthen the proved ties with the British iimpire, and shall always maintain its friendship ,, • Mr* Belgrave consulted me unofficially before the proclamation was issued. To delay its issue would have been to promote locally speculation and disquiet; if, on the other hand, I were officially to authorise its issue I should be anticipating the decision of His Majesty’s Government. I decided that, on the whole, the issue of the proclamation was justified since His Majesty’s Government were definitely opposed to official interference in the succession - though, of course, they could withold recognition of a successor if they so wished! Moreover, there was reason to believe that His Majesty’s Government would welcome Shaikh SaLcan as Ruler of Bahrain and would, therefore, welcome any step which helped to establish him firmly end peaceably in that position. I therefore suggested to Mr.Belgrave that the proclamation should be issued without reference to me. ^ b\ 11* The formal recognition of His Majesty's Government and the Government of India to the succession of His Highness Shaikh Salman was communicated to the Shaikh in a letter which I personally handed to him on the 1st of March, 1942. Hia Highness was very pleased at the prompt recognition of his succession and expressed ths hope, which I cordially recipro cated, that I should always be the bearer of good tidings. 12. It is satisfactory that Shaikh Hamad’s successor has established himslef as Ruler of Bahrain without the active intervention of the Political Agent. The only positive steps which I took to assist the course of events were ray request to Mr.Belgrave that he should take Immediate stepsto place ohaikh Hamad’s testament In Shaikh Salman’s hands, and mg unofficial concurrence in the/issue of Shaikh Salman’s proclamation of February 22nd. I should like to place on record, however, that the responsibilities which devolved on me when Shaikh Hamad died were greatly lightened by the knowledge of the policy to be pursued in such a contingency which I derived from study 'of the records of 1938 and 1939 when, it will be recalled, the question of a successor to Shaikh Hamad was discussed from every angle. As matters have turned out Shaikh Hamad’s testament appointing his eldest son to succeed him has proved fortunate ae the terms of that testament have added the sanction of Shaikh Hamad’s authority to the independent choice of the Khalifsh family; bou i. cL/ f y { f&gt;ry and the testament which Mr. Weigbtman was at such pains to secure from Shaikh Hamad has proved an invaluable asset to Shaikh Salman in securing general assent to his succession. In slightly altered circumstances, however, Shaikh Hamad’s testament (the secret of which was almost too well kept) might have proved an embarrassment. If, for instance, at the interview between Shaikhs Salman and Abdullah before Shaikh Haxaed died, the decision had been that Shaikh Abdullah should succeed, it would have been very difficult for the Political Agent to know whether to withhold the testament - and be guilty of duplicity - or produce it - and create strife. A similar difficulty would have arli^en if, events occurring ss they have occurred, Shaikh Hamad's testament had been in favour of Shaikh Abdullah. The factor which was not, arid could not have been, foreseen was that the question of the succession would virtually be decided before Shaikh Hamad was dead, and, therefore, before the contents of his testament could be known. Happily, however, thesecret choice of Shaikh Hamad and the public choice of the Khalifah family coincided. The clash of equally balanced claiorta vss avoided, anc. Shaikh Salci?3n, without opposition or dispute, ruled in his father* s stead. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Political .Agent, Bahrain. ii,, &lt; i / yU ^ ■CONFIDENTIAL.

Honourable Resident, Gentlemen; I have ascended the throne of Bahrain in succession to my esteemed forefathers according to the will of my ') fatiier Shaikh Hamad, upon whom may God have mercy, with the support of my uncles, my brothers amd ay family, I take this opportunity to offer my profound thanks for the letter which has been handed to me by the Honour able Resident which is addressed to me by His Excellency The Viceroy indicating the recognition of ay rule over Bahrain and its Dependencies by His Majesty 9 s Government and the Government of India, I shall firmly adhere to the ancient and proven friendship with the British Government ever renewing, with the help of God, the ties of amity, I thank the Honourable Resident for his congratulations and for his expression of good wishes towards me and our country and I appreciate his references to my late father, may God have mercy upon him. Gentlemen; This country of ours, Bahrain, though fortunately an independent state, is in these difficult times of raging war, a war whose end nobody can forsee, dependent upon the help of the British Government against all dangers from outside. The rule of Bahrain is a heavy burden but we shall endeavour, Invoking God’s help, to improve the condition of our family and of our loyal subjects and our country, adhering to the Faith and being vigilant in the interests of our people.J &gt; • 2 - I repeat again that this war is a savage war and we do not know what will be its course or when it will finish* We must, with God’s help, preserve the living conditions in our country. My Government has imposed regulations and will impose more regulations to ensure proper arrangements for the supplies of food in Bahrain. We shall not permit individuals to seek their own advantage at the expense of the poor, in order to make bigger profits. The condition of the poor must be taken into consideration before anything else. Many people complain about the increased cost of living in Bahrain but if we consider other countries we find that the hardships in Bahrain are less owing to our care in arranging these matters, with God’s help. We have arranged to bring a reserve supply of food from India.and we have requested the Government of India to assist us in obtaining these supplies. We hope t at we shall secure supplies which will last us a long time. We regret that Baiirain depends upon vessels from elsewhere and that at present there are no Bahrain boats bringing important necessities to our country. At the same time our Governrent is doing its best to deal with this matter. Many of you have heard of the possible landing of British troops within our boundaries. This has my approval. The object is the protection of our country against an attack by the common enemy. We know that we ourselves have not sufficient trained forces to defend Bahrain against a big attack. The fountain of our prosperity is a fountain encompassed with danger. Should conditions in Bahrain become more difficult I am confident t at I con depend upon the loyalty of my people in any steps which may become necessary. I myself will work to the best of my endeavour to preserve the safety of my people and my country and I am ever confidant in the help of the British Government.confidential N o* C/437 , Political Agency, Bahrain, the 8th April 1942® To The Hon f ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf Camp, Bahrain® Memorandum I enclose copies of an English translation of the speech delivered on behalf of His Highness Shaikh Salman at the Kharita Durbar held on the 6th April 1942® 2® The following comments are offered in respect of the speech s~ Para 1® The word ^will 1 is a rendering of an Arabic word which has a double significance, meaning both a testa mentary disposition and a mandate or injunction.

( Vide para 48 of Bahrain Intelligence Summary No®6 of 1942). His Highness expressed the hope that I would assist him in this project.

It would, however, be unwise to interpret the applause as being an expression of undivided public opinion on this subject.

The Manager, The Eastern Bank, Ltd., Bahrain. Dear Sir 3j % War Loan Registered - £90894.14.11 account His Late Highness Shaikh Sir Hamad bin Isa Alkhalifah, Ruler of Bahrain. In reference to your airgraph letter of the 10th August last and our letter of the 4th instant, we have to amplify the latter as follows•- The securities in question being 3^o War Loan no Estate Duty is payable in this country. Although the present Shaikh has been recognised as such by the British Government, we have yet to consider who It is who can give us a valid discharge for the securities in question. From the fact that certain securities were held by us here for the State, whilst those in question were held by us for the late Shaikh, it would appear that the latter were the private property of the late Shaikh, being, in all probability, in whole or in greater part, purchased from his share in the Oil Royalties. We are informed by the India Office that the late Shaikh left a will and that it was deposited with the Bank at Bahrain. The following questions arise.- 1. If there was a will was an executor appointed,and if 30,whQf* 2* Has probate been obtained in Bahrain? 3. What were the terms of the will? 4. If the late Shaikh died intestate have Letters of Administra tion to his estate been granted In Bahrain, and, if so, to whom? 5. Was the late Shaikh a Sunni or a Shiah? 6 . Have w yb.a heirs of the late Shaikh consented to the will, if there^one, before or after his death? 7. Who are the heirs of the late Shaikh? 8 . Is the Mohammedan Law administered in Bahrain similar to the Law administered in India? Is there a Succession Act in Bahrain similar to that in India? Had the case arisen In India tho law applicable would beas follows•- A Mohamrcsdan cannot by will dispose of more than one-third of his estate (l.e. the surplus after payment of funeral expenses and debts) unless, if a Sunni, the heirs consent thereto after his death, or, if a Shiah, they consent thereto eitherbefore or after his death# A Sunni Mohammedan cannot by will make a bequest to an heir unless the other heirs consent to the bequest after the death of the testator; a single heir may consent so as to bind his own share* A Shiah Mohammedan may make a bequest to an heir provided it does not exceed one-third of his estate, or with the consent of the other heirs, given before or after his death, to any extent* Section 211 (1) of the Indian Succession Act runs as follows.- 'The executor or administrator, as the case may be, of a ^ deceased person is his legal representative for all purposes, and all the property of the deceased person vests in him as such'» The expression 'Administrator' is defined In Section 2 (a) as follows•- The whole estate vests in the executor whether probate has or has not been Issusd} the title of the administrator, however, depends on the grant* hold one-third of the estate for the purposes of the will and two- thirds as bare trustee for the heirs. So far as outsiders were concerned, however, he would represent the estate* So far as outsiders were concerned an administrator would also represent the estate* you would obtain from the Political Agent specific answers to the above questions and If the late Shaikh did leave a will we shall require a copy* 'Administrator means a person appointed by a competent authority to administer the estate of a deceased person when there is no executor'. Assuming that there were no consents the executor would To enable us to deal with this matter we should be glad if Sgd* N.S. Golder Yours faithfully General Manager•H No. 1361 Office of the Adviser to the G-overn^ent,, Bahrain Dated, 27th Shawal, 1361 November 7, 1942. H. 3. m* s Political A^ent, Bahrain. I have received a copy of a letter addressed to you by the Manager, Eastern ijank Limited, Bahrain, j dated, 2nd November 1942, in which he encloses a letter from his London Office.^ There may be some points in the letter on which I can give additional information. All the securities in question were the private property of the late Shaikh. They vvere purchased out of his private income. The late Shaikh did not leave a will. He left a document appointing his successor and this document was lodged in the Eastern Bank, Bahrain. Owing to this fact it is unnecessary to reply to questions 1, 2, and 3. The entire estate of the late Ruler has oeen taken over by his successor according to the custom of the Ruling Family in Bahrain. The late Shaikh was a Sunni. The heirs consist of sons, daughters, and wives, the obligation to support and provide for them falls on the new ^?uler but they do not inherit any part oi the estate whether ancestral property or cash or effects. The heirs are agreeable to what is known to them to be the regular laniiy custom. There is no Succession Act in Bahrain, mohamedan Law is administered by the Shera Court only in cases - relating -relating to marriage, divorce and inheritance among the general public. The estates 01 members of the Ruling Family are not aliected by 3hera Law. It is appreciated that normally in the case of a Mohamedan dying intestate the estate would be divided among the heirs according to Shera Law but the estates of the Rulers of Bahrain are not and never have been subject of Shera Law.

Dear Sir, 3^% War Loan Registered - £90894.14.11 a/c His Late Highness Shaikh Sir Hamad bin Isa Alkhalifah. Li*/ Replies to the questions asked in letter No.33/11 dated 14th September 1942 from your Head Office are as followss- 1. The ’‘will” left by His late Highness Shaikh Hamad was not a disposition of his property but a statement of his wish and direction that his eldest son, Shaikh Salman, should succeed him as Ruler of Bahrain. 2. Does not arise. 3. See 1 above. 4. The late Shaikh died intestate so far as the disposition of his property was concerned. Letters of Administration to his estate have not been granted, since the estate is auto matically administered by the late Shaikh* s successor as Ruler (c.f. 8 below) 5» Sunni. 6. Does not arise. 7* The only heir is the present Ruler of Bahrain, His Highness Shaikh Salman. 8. In regard to the question^ of succession the Ruling Family of Bahrain ao not observe Mohanu*- edan (Shara) Law. Succession is governed by Family Law, which has never been disputed and which makes a Ruler* a successor the sole in heritor of all his personal estate. The new Ruler is, of course, under an obligation to make provision for the maintenance of relatives and dependents of his predecessor. Succession among Bahrain Mohammedans, other them members of the Ruling Family, is not governed by a Succession Act but by Mohammedan Law administered by a Shara Court.

Kis late Highness Shaikh Hanad*s estate consisted of cash, personal effects and property of unascertained value in Bahrain, and a sum of £ 90,894/14/11 in British Government 34% War Loan. 3. The estates of Pulers of Bahrain have never been divided up among their heirs according to Share law but are inherited in toto by the member of the family who succeeds as Puler. In accordance with this family custom the entire estate of Shaikh Hamad was taken over by his eldest son and successor, Shaikh Salman. Shaikh Hamad’s natural heirs (his sons, daughters and wives) acquiesced without demur in Shaikh Salman’s inheritance of the whole of his father's estate. Shaikh Salman, on his part, recognises his obligation to support and provide for all members of the A1 Khalifa who were dependent on his father Yours sincerely, The Hon’ble Lieut.-Col.
