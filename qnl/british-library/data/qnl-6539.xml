April 1S99. CONFIDENTIAL. (7101.) Despatch from Sir M. Durand respecting appointment of Additional Consular Officers in Persia. [With a Map ] Sir M. Durand to the Marquess of Salisbury.—{Received March 20.) (No. 16.) My Lord, Tehran, February 12, 1899. I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Lordship's despatches Nos. 61 of the 27th June and No. 8, Consular, of the 29th September, 1898, calling for my opinion with regard to certain suggestions for the appointment of additional Consular officers in Persia. The matter has engaged my attention for several years, and I have more than once expressed my opinion upon it. In September 1895 I wrote a Memorandum reviewing the state of affairs in Persia, and submitting proposals for the improvement of our position. An officer had shortly before been sent to act as Consul in Kerman, and I wrote with reference to this appointment: “ It will strengthen our influence materially if we have more men of this kind in other parts of Persia as occasion offers, and if our Representatives in Bushire and Ispahan and Khorassan are encouraged to travel and make friends among the Chiefs and tribesmen. We need not excite the ready alarm of the Prussians by too frequent journeys along their border, hut I think we should spend some money in encouraging travel elsewhere, and in establishing Agencies at important points. For instance, I feel very doubtful whether the Government of India are right in deprecating the establishment of a British officer in Seistan; and, under certain conditions, we might find it very useful to have a man in Shuster to help in the opening of the roads in the Lur and Bakhtiari country.” I also advocated an improvement in the position of the Consul-General in Tabreez. In August 1896 I submitted a detailed proposal for the establishment of a Consulate at Shuster, on the Karun, where our traders had been brutally ill-used, and I suggested that for their protection and the maintenance of order we might raise a tribal levy under British officers. A year later, when in England, I followed up these suggestions by advocating the retention of the Kerman appointment, and again asking for the establishment of a Consul on the Karun. The result was that the Kerman appointment w'as continued, provisionally, and since that time the nomination by the Russians of a Consul for Seistan has led to our also appointing a Consul for that district; but I believe no further steps have been taken to carry out my suggestions. Those suggestions formed part of a general scheme of policy, based upon an examination of the state of affairs in Persia in 1895. The further suggestions which I now desire to submit must, i think, in like manner, form part of a general scheme of policy, based upon an examination of the state of affairs in Persia at the present time. The question of our Consular establishments cannot be considered apart from the larger question. Almost the whole of the Memorandum of 1895 applies to the present position, and the paper contains a general statement of the views which I held then, and hold still, regarding the manner in which we should deal with Persia. I would therefore ask that the Memorandum may be read, and that this despatch may be considered as a supplement bringing it up to date. I can then confine myself to pointing out the [392] B2 changes which have taken place since the Memorandum was written, supplying at the same time such further information as may be necessary to give a comprehensive view of the present state of affairs. For convenience sake, though I trust the whole Memorandum will be considered, I will here quote the penultimate paragraph, which sums up my views and proposals. It ran as follows :— “ Persia is misgoverned, and her condition is not satisfactory. Her finances are in disorder, and her resources undeveloped, and she contains some elements of disturbance, while there is no armed force upon which the Government can depend for the maintenance of its authority. The influence of Russia, which is antagonistic to our own, predominates at Tehran, and it is believed to be exerted against the interests of the country. “ On the other hand, Persia has practically no debt, and her natural resources are great. Her internal condition is not hopeless, or such as to cause immediate alarm. And the influence of Russia, though predominant, is not exclusive. England has still a strong position throughout the country; and Russia, recognizing her own weakness in Asia, seems unlikely for the present to take any step in Persia which would seriously offend us. “ The general situation, therefore, might be worse, but it is not one with which we can rest altogether satisfied. “ It is not probable that Russia will combine with England in reorganizing the Persian Administration, and in developing her trade; and there is little hope to be got in this direction from other European nations, none of whom carry any weight in Tehran. “England by herself, especially if thwarted by Russia, cannot hope to overcome the opposition of interested persons in high places, and to carry a scheme of reform which will regenerate Persia. She can hardly hope, indeed, to carry any reform of radical importance, and must fall back upon her existing policy, contenting herself with maintaining the integrity of Persia ; watching and checking Russian aggression; gaining the goodwill, respect, and confidence of the Persian Government and people ; developing trade ; and taking such opportunities as may occur of urging measures beneficial to the country. “ 'With a view to maintaining the integrity and independence of Persia, it is desirable to make timely arrangements for securing a quiet succession on the Shah’s death, and we should endeavour to strengthen our influence over the heir apparent by keeping an English doctor with him, by improving the position of our Representative at Tabreez, and in other ways. We should let it be understood that aggressive action bv Russia in the north of Persia will immediatelv result in decided action by us in the • * •/ south. “ In order to strengthen the friendly feelings entertained towards us in many parts of the country, we should encourage picked officers to travel among the Chiefs and people, and we should, as occasion offers, establish fresh agencies at important noints. We should try to obtain for the people such benefits as a good currency. “The Persian Government should be made to understand that thev must not trifle * with us in the future as they have occasionally done in the past; but we should try to gain their goodwill, and to help them in any way we can. Just now there is an opportunity of putting them under a great obligation by relieving them to some extent of the burden of the Regie Debt, which they find very harassing. The Shah has begged us earnestly to help him in this way, and has at the same time formally asked our advice as to the reforms which should be made in his Administration. I think we should give this advice to the best of our power, and should clear off* the Regie Debt by lending the Persian Government half-a-million at 3 or I per cent, on approved security, and on certain defined conditions. These conditions should include advantages to our trade, such as the opening of the Upper Karun, and also a satisfactory guarantee that the revenue and expenditure of the Persian Government shall, for the future, be made to balance. “ The probable result of such action on our part will be the introduction of a certain measure of administrative reform, and the strengthening of our influence in Persia, especially in the south, where we ought to be able to revive it and make it very strong. “ If we do not help the Persian Government in the manner indicated, we run the risk of alienating the Sadr-i-Azam, who has been sore with us about the Regie Debt, and of driving him and the Shah, whose greed for money is increasing with age, into some compromising transaction with Russia.”I will now proceed to enumerate the principal changes which have taken place since these w T ords were written. The old Shah, Nasr-ed-Din, who had then ruled for nearly fifty years, is now dead. He has heen succeeded by his second son, Mozaffer-ed-Din, who has proved an amiable but very weak Euler. The Sadr-i-Azam, or Prime Minister, all powerful in 1895, was overthrown in the following year. He has now returned to office, but with a shadow of his former power. All real power is at present in the bands of the Shah’s irresponsible advisers, notably his doctor, the Hakim-ul-Mulk. There is practically no Government. Some of the troops have disbanded themselves, and the rest are unpaid. The pay of the civil establishments is also in serious arrears. The finances, which were in disorder in 1895, are in worse disorder now\ The Sadr-i-Azam has borrowed 300.000/. from the Russian Bank in Tehran, but all attempts at raising a substantial loan have broken down. The revenues, except from customs, are coming in very slowly ; and at this moment the one hope of getting any considerable sum of money lies in the sale of the Provincial Governorships to the highest bidder. This destructive system, abolished by the new Shah when he came to the throne, has been revived by the Sadr-i-Azam ; and it is said that this year’s auction is to be on a very large scale indeed. There is much murmuring throughout the country at the state of things in Tehran, and the discontent is increased by the high price of food, which has led here and there to some serious rioting. Altogether, the internal condition of Persia is very unsatisfactory. The Russians, meanwhile, have not been inactive. To the north, the road from Enzeli to Tehran, which had made but little progress before the visit of General Kouropatkine to Persia in 1895, has, since then, been vigorously pushed on, and it is now r nearly ready for wheel traffic throughout its length. This is a most important advantage to Russia, both from a commercial and from a military point of view. Even now r two-thirds of the imported goods sold in Tehran are Russian. In the north west, Russia has pushed forward her railway towards Kars, and has surveyed a line from Kars to the Tabreez frontier, while within Azerbaijan there has been a remark able propaganda among the Nestorian Christians, some thousands of whom have been w on over to the Orthodox Church, thereby obtaining Russian protection and opening the door to Russian interference. To the north-east, the Russians have constructed a good cart-road from Asterabad to the Meshed frontier, and, by energetically encouraging their trade in Khorassan, they have secured a commanding position in this valuable market. They have also made use of the outbreak of plague in India to push dowm “ sanitary ” posts along the Afghan border in the direction of Seistan, wdiere also they are trying to introduce their trade, and where they are shortly to have a Consul. Even in the centre of Persia, as far south as Ispahan, the Russians have shown fresh activity by establishing there a Consulate on a considerable scale of expenditure, and our Consul reports that the sale of Russian goods has already begun to increase. I will not go into detail here, or enumerate the persistent rumours which reach me as to Russian schemes in various directions; but it is, 1 think, (piite clear, from the facts I have mentioned, that the Russians have been working consistently, and not without effect, to push their trade and to enhance their political influence in the country. It is only natural that their operations and the unsatisfactory state of internal affairs should have had a depressing effect upon British trade. We are being rapidly ousted from the Khorassan market. In Tehran itself our trade is undoubtedly suffering, and wdll suffer more as the Resht road is opened to traffic. In the north west our Trebizond trade has fallen off to a serious extent. Even in the Gulf ports, where, by the way, there has been some attempt at Belgian and German competition, we are not doing as well as we might be. The shrinking of our Khorassan trade has told here, and the most recent Returns cannot, I think, be regarded as satisfactory. On the other hand, it must not be supposed that recent changes in Persia have all been unfavourable to our interests. This is not the case. In one respect w r e have reason to be very well satisfied. Three years ago almost every man in the country, Persian or European, believed that the death of the Shah w r ould he the signal for general disorder and for some marked advance on the part of Russia, possibly involving the break-up of the country. I stated in my Memorandum of 1895 my reasons for doubting the correctness of this view, but it was the prevalent view, and I asked Her Majesty’s Government to make timely preparations. This danger, at least, has been averted.When His Majesty was murdered it was very doubtful whether there would not he an outbreak of the Tehran garrison, which would have been followed by serious trouble all over Persia, and Russian troops were, in fact, held in readiness for an immediate advance ; but, thanks to English money, the outbreak did not take place, and the succession was peaceful. If the present Shah should die as suddenly as his father, we may reasonably hope that the succession may again pass over quietly. This is, no doubt, a negative gain, but, from our point of view, it is very important. The Shah, too, though weak, is well-meaning, and not, I think, at all inclined to submit to Russian dictation. He has retained his English doctor in spite of determined attacks on the part of the Russian and Erench Legations, who wanted to put in a Frenchman ; and he has nominated as his heir apparent his eldest son, who wa§ opposed by the Russians; and his most influential adviser, the Hakim-ul-Mulk, is believed to be very friendly to us. To turn to other matters mentioned in my Memorandum of 1895, and connected points, we have defined the long disputed boundary between Persia and Kelat, and have pushed forward from India along the trade route to Seistan, and have sent officers into Seistan itself, and have made arrangements for the improvement of the trade route from Ahwaz to Ispahan. We have severely punished a tribe on the Gulf coast which was responsible for the murder of one of our telegraph officers, and we have sent a detachment of British Indian troops to protect the telegraph line for the future. This has had a good effect. Disturbances have occurred in Kelat territory, but they have not spread to Persian Beluchistan, and the Ruler of this important province has throughout behaved in the most friendly manner. On the Karim, at Shuster, our people have suffered seriously from the fanaticism of the town mob, which has been fostered, if not created, by the weakness of the Persian Government; but we are on good terms with the Arabs and Bakhtiaris who hold the neighbouring country, and a little decided action on the part of the Persian Government would soon put matters right in Shuster itself, where the people were at one time particularly friendly to us. In the south we have greatly strengthened our position by insisting upon, and obtaining, the removal ot an obnoxious Governor of Bushire. I dwelt in my Memorandum of 1895 upon the importance of the principle involved, and I would invite special attention to the point. The effect of the case has been most remarkable. Altogether, it is certain, from the reports of officers who have had recent opportunities of judging, that in the southern zone our reputation just now stands very high indeed. In Tehran itself we have had to deal, and still have to deal, with some hostility or obstructiveness on the part of influential officials, but among them also our action in the south has had its effect, and recent events in the Soudan have created a great impression here. I do not think our political influence at the capital is any weaker than it was in the time of the late Shah. On the contrary, I think that at this moment it is stronger. Even with regard to trade, there are some encouraging features in the prospect. Perhaps, as this matter is one of very great importance, and as it is especially connected with the question of our Consular establishments, I had better examine it in some detail. I may begin by pointing out that we have in Tehran an English Bank, the Imperial Bank of Persia, with a capital of 650,000/., and branches at Tabreez, Resht, Meshed, Ispahan, Shiraz, Yezd, and Bushire. This is the only bank in Persia which can legally issue notes. It has, I believe, done some unsatisfactory business in India, but so far as its business in this country is concerned, it is in a flourishing condition. It did signal service on the occasion of the Shah’s death, when it provided, at a few hours’ notice, large sums of money both at Tehran and at Tabreez, thus enabling the Provisional Government to pay up the troops, who were in a very dangerous state. The bank has been threatened to some extent by Russian competition, but so far it more than holds its own. Our trade enters Persia by a variety of routes, of which the following may be mentioned:— 1. Erom Trebizond into the north-west corner of Persia, near Bayazid. 2. Erom the Turkish frontier near Kbanikin—“ the Bagdad route.” 3. By the Karun ports : Mohammerah and Ahwaz. 4. By Bushire. 5. By Lingah, Bundar Abbas, and minor ports in the eastern parts of the Gulf. 6. Erom Kelat territory. 7. Erom Afghanistan.The T&amp;st-named route has been practically closed for the time, partly by the exactions of the Ameer and partly by the Russian sanitary posts, which have stopped the passage of caravans between the Afghan border and South-Eastern Persia. Of the other routes, that by Trebizond still brings in a considerable volume of British trade, but less than half it once brought in. The estimated yearly value of this trade is now about 302,000/. Curzon’s estimate for 1889 was about 610,000/. It should be observed, however, that, although the decrease is doubtless due in part to Russian competition, it is also due in part to the Armenian massacres and the troubled state of the country during the last few years. There was a dreadful massacre in Trebizond itself, which shook the confidence of our traders. Trade checked in this way is likely to be diverted through other channels rather than lost, and I believe this is what has happened. Part of our Trebizond trade has now passed over to the more southerly routes, especially that by Bagdad. The trade by the Bagdad route has increased in importance, and seems likely to increase still further, especially if the railway system spreads in Asia Minor and Turkish Arabia. In the absence of any English competition, the Germans have unfortunately obtained a Concession for making the road from Tehran to Khanikin ; and British trade in this quarter is threatened by the Russian road from Resht to Kazvin, which, under the terms of the Concession, may be prolonged to Hamadan. Still, at present, the bulk of the goods imported by this route are British, and we hold the Kermanshah and Hamadan markets to the exclusion of all European competitors. From there we push forward into Kurdistan and other districts, including Tehran and Ispahan. Our trade for last year was estimated by the bank agent in the Custom house at a total of 1,018,155/., of which 838.521/. is British; and the exports are said to have been exceptionally small this year because of a bad opium crop. Also, the water in the Tigris was so low that transport was much impeded. Curzon’s estimate- for 1889 was 327,796/. The Karim route may some day be one of the most important of all. The existing value of our trade is small, and the last figures* show a decrease on those given by Curzon for 1890, the total being only 126,550/. as against 180,680/. But there is reason to hope that the state of things will not continue. We are now opening out the road from Ahwaz to Ispahan, and believe that we shall thereby effect a large saving of time and cost in comparison with the Bushire and Ispahan route, which is long and difficult. Also, we are trying to open out roads northwards from the Karun to Sultanabad, the centre of the carpet trade, and to Hamadan and the surrounding country. I attach much value to the Karun route, which, from the nature of things, is entirely in our hands, and protected from any serious competition. Some good judges believe it will before long be our main trade route. Its future, however, is by no means certain, and we must not feel too sanguine about it. The Bushire route is at present the most important of all, the volume of British trade for 1897 being estimated at 1,155,039/. This route must always be important, and seems likely to do well even if the Karun route develops. At present, it fills the country with British goods as far as Ispahan, where the Russian competition is small, and even supplies Tehran, 800 miles from the sea. The eastern ports have suffered from the shrinking of the Khorassan and Afghan markets, and can show no increase on the figures given for 1889. Still they supply a very large tract of country, and their trade should not suffer any further from Russian competition. They ought easily to hold their own in Yezd, Kerman and South-eastern Persia generally. The value of their trade to us in 1897 was estimated at 1,026,990 a-year. The trade by the Kelat route is as yet small, but promises well. If we can succeed in pushing our goods into Seistan from the south of Khorassan by the caravan road from Quetta, and especially if the Government of India should decide to construct a railway, there may be a real future for this route. The estimated value of the trade for 1898 is 39,329/. Altogether if one looks at the map of Persia the position held by our trade is very remarkable. It is in full possession of the country up to and including a line drawn from Khanikin by Kermanshah, Hamadan, Ispahan, Yezd and Kerman to Seistan. Beyond that line it has begun to give ground both in the north-west and in Tehran and in Khorassan, but, in spite of great geographical disadvantages, it has by no means been excluded. Its total value is estimated at over 3,488,000/. This is an increase of nearly 500,000/. on the estimate given by Curzon for 1889, a rise of * For the Karuii and the Gulf port? I have failed to tret anv complete figures later than tho?e of 1897. [892] ' C16 per cent, in nine years. This is not, I think, a discouraging state of things, especially when it is considered that the last seven years have been for Persia a very unlucky period in various ways. Year after vear great tracts of territory in southern Persia have been devastated by locusts. Then we have had troubles consequent on the Tobacco Pegie, and a severe epidemic of cholera and disorder following on the death of the Shah, and a succession of bad crops, causing a great rise in the prices of food. In Shiraz there Las been such scarcity that three years ago the Persian Government contemplated importing wheat from India. Export of wheat has been forbidden for some time, and naturally the purchasing power of the population has been comparatively low, which has told on imports. And I imagine the plague in India has had a depressing effect on the Bombay and Karachi trade. Altogether, though we have suffered and must suffer from Russian competition in the north, our trade has on the whole increased, and with better seasons it gives fair promise of prosperity. It should be noted that the shrinking of the Khorassan trade is partly due to the fact that our goods now reach Central Asia by Batoum and Baku, and the Trans-Caspian Railway. The “ Kovoya Yremja ” writes very mournfully about this. Such are the principal changes which have taken place in Persia of late years ; but before summing them up, with a view of examining the present state of affairs and submitting proposals for improving our position, I think it may be desirable to state briefly what, are our present establishments in the country, and what amount of money we spend on them. I append a sketch map which will give some idea of the political geography. The Diplomatic and Consular staff is as follows :— At Tehran, the capital, we have a Minister with three Diplomatic Secretaries, two Oriental Secretaries,.a surgeon, and a Vice-Consul. The total cost of the Legation is estimated at 16,640/.a-year, of which.India pays 7,000/. At Meshed, to the east, we have two officers of the Indian Political Service, who are also Consul-General and Vice-Consul, and a surgeon. The total cost of the Agency is estimated at 8,600/. a-year. This is paid by India. At Asterabad, to the north-east, we have a native Agent, who costs 48/. a-year. This is paid by Her Majesty’s Government. At Resht we have a Consulate, which costs 750/. a year. This is paid by Her Majesty’s Government. At Tabreez, to the north-west, we have a Consulate-General, the cost of which is estimated at 920/. a-year. This is paid by Her Majesty’s Government. To the west of Tehran, at Kermanshah, on the Bagdad road, we have a native Agent, who costs 24/. a-year. This is paid by India. Midway between the Caspian Sea and the Persian Gulf, at Ispahan, we have a Consulate, costing 750/. a-year. This is paid by Her Majesty’s Government. There is also a native Agent, who costs 28/. Further south again, at Shiraz, we have a native Agent, costing 160/. a-year. This is paid by India. To the east of Shiraz, half-way to the frontier of India, we have a Consul at Kerman, who costs 500/. a-year. This appointment is provisional. Half the cost is paid by India and half by Her Majesty’s Government. The Consul at Kerman is now in Seistan, where it is now proposed to keep a Consul in future. Finally, along the coast of the Persian Gulf we have:— At Mohammerah a Vice-Consulate, which costs 490/. a-year. This is paid by Her Majesty’s Government. At Bushire a Resident, who is also Consul-General for Pars, with three Assistants, one of whom is Vice-Consul, and a surgeon. The cost of the Residency is estimated at 7,700/. This is paid by India. The political work on the coast between Bushire and the Kelat frontier is in the hands of the Director of the Persian Gulf Telegraphs, who gets an allowance of 120/. a-year. This is paid by India. The Resident at Bushire has also under his orders native Agents at Bahrein, Shargah, and Lingah, and they cost about 240/. a-year. This completes the statement of our Diplomatic, Political, and Consular estab lishments in Persia. It will be seen that we employ twenty-one British officers, and that the total cost is about 36.970/. Of this total, as far as I can make out, Her Majesty’s Government pay 12,876/., and the Government of* India, 24,094/.I should add that in the case of non-Indian Consulates I have made no allowance for travelling charges, as these are quite uncertain. We might perhaps add about 1,500/. a-year for this and other minor charges, which I need not mention. Besides the Diplomatic, Political, and Consular establishments, it is to be observed that we maintain in Persia and the Persian Gulf a considerable Telegraph Department, with a numerous staff of English clerks. This department has been, and to some extent still is, a valuable organization for political and intelligence purposes. The telegraph clerks can supply much useful information at times, and in out-of-the-way places they are often called upon to act in somewhat responsible situations. The sketch map appended to this despatch shows the lines of telegraph through Persia and the Gulf. Of these the lines extending from Tehran to Bushire, and the line along the Gulf coasts to Fao, Jask, Charbar, and the Kelat, are maintained by our telegraph staff, and are thoroughly efficient. The Persian line from Tehran to fleshed is inspected by our telegraph staff, and the Government of India give a Grant- in-aid of 20,000 rupees a year towards the cost of maintenance. We have an English clerk at Meshed. This line works well. The line from Tehran to Julfa in the north west is in the hands of the Indo-European Telegraph Company, which has its head quarters in London, hut it is of no great use to us for political purposes, as it is closely watched by the Russians. This line is efficient. The rest of the lines shown on the map are maintained and worked by the Persian Government, and are very inefficient indeed. We can now go on to review as a whole the state of affairs in Persia in 1899, and to consider what steps we can take to improve our position. The internal condition of the country, which was bad enough in 1895, is now in some respects decidedly worse. The Shah, though a more amiable man than his father, is weak, and easily misled; the Prime Minister has no power, and cannot control his colleagues or the Provincial authorities; the finances are in complete disorder, and the revenues are coming in very slowly ; the troops are unpaid, and inclined to be mutinous; food is dear all over the country, and the people are discontented. Meanwhile the Russians have been actively pushing their trade and political influence in the north of Persia, and with some success. They have even succeeded in establishing posts along the Afghan border, and in making themselves felt in Seistan and Ispahan. On the other hand it is as true now as in 1895 that the internal condition of Persia is not hopeless. She has practically no debt, and her resources are great. And though the influence of Russia is perhaps predominant in Tehran, yet England has still a strong position throughout the country. The quiet succession of the Shah was regarded as being, and was in fact, a great success for us; and the Shah’s nomination of his eldest son as heir apparent, though the Russians were known to favour a younger son, also tended to increase our reputation. In various respects, I Lis Majesty has shown goodwill towards us, and a decided disinclination to put himself under Russian control. In the south of Persia, that is up to a line drawn from Khanikin on the Turkish frontier, through Kermanshah, Hamadan, Ispahan, Aezd, and Kerman to Seistan, our trade and our political influence are paramount, and indeed, so far as Russia is concerned, almost exclusive. Russia has only just begun to touch the fringe of the zone at Seistan and Ispahan. Neither her Consular establish ments nor her trade extend beyond these points In the north zone on the other hand, although the local influence of the Russians is strong, we have our Consular establish ments right up to the Russian border; and our trade, though it is suffering from Russian competition, is by no means beaten out of the field. The southern zone in fact is very much more in our hands, politically and commercially, than the northern zone is in Russian hands. All over Persia a large part of the telegraph system is worked by us in one form or another, and our bank has established itself in Tabreez and Resht and Meshed. Altogether, considering the advantages Russia has enjoyed, we have much reason to be surprised that our position should be as good as it is. Nevertheless, though things might be much worse than they are, it cannot be denied that, both from a political and a commercial point of view, our position is being threatened. We have now to consider what are the steps we should take to maintain and improve it. In discussing this point I shall proceed on the assumption that we cannot hope to come to terms with Russia, and persuade her to join us in a policy of reform and development. I suggested in my Memorandum of 1895 that such a proposal, if made by us, might possibly be accepted by Russia, especially if it formed part of a larger scheme— aasa 8 for the settlement of our relations in Asia, and I pointed out how advantageous such an arrangement would be for both countries. But I assume that the scheme is impracticable, and that we must continue to work alone, with Russia watchful and more or less antagonistic. Under these conditions, the question is what we can do by ourselves. In my Memorandum of 1895 I answered that question in the following words :— ° by herself, especially if thwarted by Russia, cannot hope to overcome the opposition of interested persons in high places, and to carry a scheme of reform which will regenerate Persia. She can hardly hope, indeed, to carry any reform of radical importance, and must fall back upon her existing policy, contenting herself with maintaining the integrity and independence of Persia, watching and checking Russian aggression, gaining the goodwill, respect, and confidence of the Persian Government and people, developing trade and taking such opportunities as may occur of urging measures beneficial to the country.” In the body of the Memorandum I explained at length the difficulties in the way of all attempts at reform, and I proposed certain definite steps which we should take m prosecution of the general policy stated above. Substantially the answer now must, I think, be the same as in 1895, for sub- stantialh the position is the same. But the changes which I have noted in the internal condition of the country, and the recent efforts of the Russians in the north and centre of Persia, seem to make it necessary that I should supplement the proposals I made three years ago, and should explain, in somewhat greater detail, the measures which I think desirable. The chief proposal which I have to make meets the question raised in your Lordship s despatches under reply. It is that we should increase and render more efficient our Consular establishments in Persia. As stated at the beginning of this despatch, I have at various times recommended the establishment of Consulates in Seistan, Kerman, and on the Karun, and I have also advocated an improvement in the position of the Consul-General at Tabreez. Since then the Consul at Van and the Consul-General at Tabreez have recommended the establishment of a Vice-Consulate at Urumia, while the Resident at Bushire has suggested to me the appointment of Vice-Consuls at Bahrein and Bunder Abbas. The last suggestion is supported by Captain Sykes. . Resident at Bushire has also suggested certain arrangements for the better maintenance of our interests in Shiraz. The appointment of a Russian Consul at Ispahan has led me to consider the necessity of making some improvement in the position of our Consul. The Government of India contemplates the possibility of appointing an English Consular officer to Bampur. Finally, it has been ur^ed upon me that a Vice-Consul would be extremely useful at Kermanshah. Uour Lordship desires to have from me a Report showing the places ^t which the appointment of Consular officers would, in my opinion, be desirable, the limits of their respective districts, the grounds of my recommendations, and a detailed estimate of the expenditure which those appointments would entail. My opinion upon all the suggestions above mentioned is as follows :— (a.) In the first place we should have an officer in Seistan, and perhaps native Agents at some points between Seistan and Meshed. ^b e Kerman Consulate should be made permanent, and perhaps a British Vice-Consul or native Agent should be sent to Bampur. (c.) The Resident in Bushire should spend the summer in Shiraz, and any necessary expense for a house and other details should be incurred. position W6 Sh ° Uld raiSe thB pay ° f the Coilsul at Ispahan, and improve his (e.)

If the Government of India agree, I am inclined to think that we should have a Vice-Consul in Bunder Abbas, with charge of the trade throughout South- Eastern Persia Also if the Government of India wish it, there can be no obiection on the part of this Legation to the appointment of a British officer to Bahrein. (/i.) Finally, we should perhaps place a British Vice-Consul in Urumia or there abouts, and we should unprove the position of the Consul-General at Tabreez9 The grounds for these recommendations are apparent from all I have written before. ('/.) With regard to the first recommendation, the importance of Seistan has long been recognized, and the recent reports of Messrs. Webb Ware and Brazier Creagh seem to put the matter beyond a doubt. We must keep Seistan in our zone. It is too valuable, and would be too dangerous in Russian hands, for us to let the Russians continue unchecked their efforts to close it to us and our trade. The necessity for having native Agents in neighbouring districts is not, I think, so clear. I have no great belief in the agency of what Surgeon-Major Creagh calls “ crafty, diplomatic natives,” unless they are very closely supervised. They often do more harm than good. But Captain Sykes will be able to advise after spending some months in Seistan. (b.) It seems to be beyond dispute that a Consulate in Kerman is becoming yearly more necessary. Wb must maintain a thorough hold on Persian Beluchistan, in the interests of our adjoining Protectorate and of our trade. Kerman is the capital of this large and important province, and the head-quarters of the Governor-General, and a trade centre of some consequence. I am inclined to think that if we have a British officer in Kerman we do not want another at Bampur. For the present, at least, I should try to do without, although we might send a native Agent there if the Consul thinks he can get a man who will not stir up mischief among the border tribes. (c.) Shiraz is a place of great importance, both commercially and as the capital of Pars, $nd the residence of the Governor-General. Our Consul-General for Ears should know something of the province and its Ruler, over whom he should endeavour to establish a personal influence. Our interests in Shiraz should not be left to the present native Agent, who, according to all the accounts I receive, does very little good and some harm. I feel some doubt whether the Resident in Busliire, who has a great deal of work to do in the Persian Gulf, is not overweighted by the charge of Ears; and it may be necessary hereafter to appoint a special officer to that charge, but for the present I would try the arrangement I have suggested. (d.) It is, I think, evidently wrong that at a place like Ispahan, where our trade and our political influence have hitherto been in full possession, the newly-appointed Russian Consul should be better equipped than our own. The former has 800/. a-year pay, a Secretary, and a free house, with other privileges, including an escort of cossacks. The latter has 600/. a-year pay, of which he has to give back 60/. in house rent, and 150/. office allowance/ I would make him a Consul-General, and raise his allowances to the level of the Russian Consul’s. (e.) A Consulate on the Karun is perhaps the most necessary of all the appoint ments I have suggested. Ahwaz may hereafter become a very important trade centre, and from there we should work upon the Arfibs and Bakhtiaris and Lurs, establishing our hold upon them, and opening up the routes through their country, and perhaps raising from among them an irregular levy. The Resident in Bushire would prefer for the present to keep our Consul at Mohammerah. I doubt the expediency of this, as he should get into touch with the Lurs and Bakhtiaris quite as much as with the Arabs of the Lower Karun. However this may be the Consul will probably require a native Agent or two for commercial work. We should, I think, for the present at least, leave the Karun under the Consul-General for Ears. Our merchants would prefer his being in direct communication with Tehran, and Captain Sykes in his Report on the Karun recommends this; but I do not think we should, until the necessity is very clearly proved, take away the district from the charge of the Consul-General. It is better that we should have the whole of the Gulf coast in one hand. (f.) A British Vice-Consulate at Kermanshah is, I think, very desirable. Our trade by the Bagdad route is increasing, and the route is a very important one in all respects. As I have shown, the British imports and exports by this route approach 1,000.000/. We must keep our hold on it if possible. Our native Agent, although a man of wealth and consequence, has from the time I have been in Persia done nothing for us, and has been a source of unending trouble and expense to the Legation owing to his quarrels with the Persians. It is the more important to keep our hold on Kermanshah, because the Russians may at any time push on their road from Kazvin to Hamadan. A Vice-Consul at Kermanshah should be directly under the orders of the Consul-General at Tehran. (g.) With regard to Bunder Abbas, the British trade of this port and Lingah aggregates over 1,000,000/. Hitherto the Government of India have not been willing °[392] £10 to establish a Vice-Consulate at this point, but I would suggest a reconsideration of their view. A Vice-Consul at Bunder Abbas, passing his summers at Yezd and his winters in working up the trade of South-Eastern Persia, ought to be able to do much good. Yezd is an important commercial centre, with a branch bank. The Vice- Consul might also perhaps relieve the Telegraph Department of their political duties, but his main work should be in connection with trade. As to Bahrein I have nothing to say. The interest of this Legation in Bahrein is so indirect, that .this seems to me to he a matter entirely for the Government of India. (h.) As to a Vice-Consul in Urumia or the neighbourhood I am not quite sure. I should have thought that full information as to what is going on in this quarter, could have been procured through the English and American missionaries,* and also that the Consul-General at Tabreez might visit the district at times as he has lately done. But the north-western corner of Azerbaijan is of importance, both as the point where our Trebizond trade enters, and with regard to the Armenian question on the Turkish frontier, and as a post from which to keep a watch on Russian proceedings. On the whole, therefore, I should be disposed to send a man there, though he will probably be followed by a Russian. I have also recommended that we should improve the position of our Consul- General at Tabreez. The grounds for this are obvious. The British Representative in this important place, the head-quarters of the heir apparent, and a great trade centre, gets (550/. a-year pay, and 270/. office allowance. The Russian Consul-General gets 2,000/. a-year pay and has a large staff of Secretaries and Munshis. The Turkish * Consul-General has 1,020/. pay and allowances, and is helped by a Vice-Consul and Attache. Even the Erench Representative, who is not a Consul-General, and has very small interests to represent, gets 1,200 a-year in pay and allow ances, and has the aid of a Vice-Consul. All the foreign Representatives have free houses. It may be argued that w 7 e ought not to attempt to rival the Russian Consul at this point. I think this is open to question, but, in any case, it seems to me unjust to our Repre sentative, and unwise in our ow r n interests, to place him in a position of such marked inferiority to all his colleagues. Mr. Wood urges that be should be allowed a personal assistant or confidential clerk. If the Vice-Consul is appointed in the first place to Tabreez, which will attract less attention, and spends part of his time there, a . confidential clerk will perhaps be unnecessary. But the danger is that he will spend too much of his time there. With regard to the limits of the new r Consular districts, I cannot as yet give a precise answ er in all cases. The limits of the Seistan Consulate, for example, must be fixed hereafter, when experience has shown us the best line of division to the north ward. The pow r ers of the Kerman Consulate should extend to the Kerman territory , ruled by the Persian Governor-General at Kerman. The limits of a Vice-Consulate at Bampur I cannot state with accuracy. The Consul on the Karun should have charge of the country down to the sea, and westward to the Turkish frontier, and eastward to the eastern border of the Bakhtiaris, and northwards to the northern border of Luristan. The Vice-Consul at Kermanshah should have charge of the Kermanshah and Hamadan districts, and of the country northwards to the border of Azerbaijan. The Vice-Consul in Urumia should perhaps be appointed simply Vice- Consul at Tabroez, whecne he can. be deputed to act under the Consul-General’s orders. The Vice-Consul at Bunder Abbas should have charge of the Gulf ports at east of Bushire, which form a Persian Governorship, and of Yezd and of Luristan. I will w 7 ork out the precise limits of the several districts in communication with the officers on the spot. All, or about all, the Consulates in Persia should have a small guard of Indian troopers, say six men, as at Meshed. These should be picked men, if possible from Lancer regiments, and the non-commissioned officers should be trained surveyors. As to the cost of the additional appointments which I have proposed, I feel it extremely difficult to make a satisfactory estimate, because the English and Indian ways of looking at such charges are so essentially different. The posts under the Government of India are maintained on a considerable scale, and cost a considerable sum of money. Those under the Foreign Office are maintained on a very moderate footing, and cost comparatively little. For example, the Consulate - General at Tabreez costs altogether 920/. a-year, while the Consulate-General at Meshed costs 8,600/. I believe the sumptuary allowance of the Consul-General at Bushire is larger * The American missionaries are greatly troubled hy the Russian propaganda, and are entirely with us.v 11 eration of d and liis &gt; do much I he Vice- ^al duties, e nothing (ms to me [iiite sure, i quarter, * and also ms lately the point on on the iceedings. i he will r Consul- ntative in de centre, icral gets i Turkish ^nsul and d has very ,s the aid : mav be * point.

I feel it id Indian ander the nsiderable moderate leneral at bed costs is larger than the pay of the Consul-General at Tabreez. As the work of the Consulates m Persia is not only Consular but political, and as a certain amount of show is very desirable in the East, I think the rates of pay and allowances given by Her Majesty s Government are much too low, and this view is evidently shared by the Ptussians. But I hesitate to propose appointments kept up on the Indian scale, because they would probably seem to Her Majesty’s Government out of all proportion to the impor tance of Persia. j. * t r Another difficulty is that any new post maintained by the Government ot India, for example Seistan or Bahrein, would probably be brought on the list of the Indian Political Department, and the Government of India would have to fix the pay with reference to the interests of that Department as a whole. However, I would suggest as a basis of calculation that each Consul should have 600/. a-year pay, 150/. office allowance, and 50/. house rent—total 800/ ; and that each A ice-Consul should have 400/. pav, 50/. a-year office allowance, and 50/. house rent—total 500/. I doubt whether this is enough, but anything less than this would certainly he too little. ^ Ihe Consuls-General at Tabreez and Ispahan should have at least 800/. a-^eai pay, 270/. office allowance, and a free house. The total expenditure on all the appointments suggested would be about 5,600/., as shown below— Seistan Kerman liampur Bunder Abbas Bahrein Karun Kermanshah Uriimia Extra expenditure at Tabreez and Ispahan, say Total £ 800* 800 500 500 500 500* 500 500 700 5,600 These proposals may he embarrassing from the point of view of the loreign Office with reference to the rest of the Consular service. I can only represent the matter from a local point of view. But I would observe that life in most paits of Persia is for an Englishman terribly isolated. It is very different from the life in European Consulates, or in seaport towns anywhere. It is also in some ways very expensive, especially in regard to presents and the transport of supplies. And, as I have said before, the work is largely of a political character. Possibly the difficulty could be met by attaching an Indian allowance to Persian Consulates. I have made no allowance for travelling expenses; it is very difficult to estimate these ; but it should he clearly understood that our officers in Persia ought to travel freely, and to know their districts. I mentioned this point in my Memorandum of 1895. . . In a country like Persia a man is of comparatively little use if he remains all the year round at his head-quarters, He should go about among the people and the Nomad tribes, and inspect the trade routes, and generally see and be seen. For this purpose he should have a proper scale of camp equipage, procured from India. At present a Consul in Persia has no travelling tents kept up for him, and if he travels he does so in a style which in India would be considered very unbecoming. He sleeps in a dirty little room in a Persian posthouse, if he finds one empty; if not, he gets into a mud hut in the nearest village. This kind of thing does harm, and should not be allowed. In one case tents have been granted to a Consul. This should be done for every officer in Persia, and every officer in Persia should be prepared to live in his tents for a considerable part of the year. Against the cost of the appointments and increase of pay proposed may be set oil a certain amount of reduction. If the Resident at Bushire spends his summer in Shiraz, we can, I think, do away with the native Agent. This would save 160/. a-year. If we have a Consul at Ahwaz or Shuster we can abolish the Vice-Consulate at Mohammerah. This would save 490/., or a little less, as we may want to keep a Persian Agent there, and possibly one at Dizful, to do routine work. The native Agent at Kermanshah can be abolished, which would save 24/. a-year. Finally, we can turn the Resht Consulate into a Vice-Consulate, thereby saving 300/. a-year. A Consul at Resht is not necessary. He gets no information of Russian movements rith us. * This may be somewhat increased by the necessity of maintaining native Agents.outside Persia, and he has no British trade to look after. A Vice-Consul could do all that is required. The money now spent at Kerman would be saved if a permanent Consulate were established there. I may perhaps be excused for suggesting that we might possibly employ to better advantage some of the money spent at Meshed. No doubt it is an important centre, politically and commercially, and the Government of India, who find the money, may not care to divert any portion of it to other posts in Persia. But after all a large portion of our trade in Persia is British Indian trade, and the maintenance of Persia, as a political entity, is largely, if not mainly, desirable, on account of our Indian Empire. It certainly seems to me that some portion of the 8,600/. spent at Meshed, and possibly some portion of the 7,700/. spent at Bushire, might be better employed elsewhere. At all events something could be spared for Seistan. However, there is room for difference of opinion on this point, and I can only suggest a saving of 1,471/. on Resht, Mohammerah, Kerman, Kermanshah, and Shiraz. The saving at Shiraz could hardly take effect immediately, as we should have to give the Nawab some pension. We might, however, add to our savings the Karun subsidy of 2,000/. a-year. In all probability Messrs. Lynch would not receive this proposal with favour, but I do not think they would abandon the Karun, where they are now firmly established. Half of the sum would go to Her Majesty’s Govern ment and half to the Government of India. The prospective payments and savings of the two Governments might perhaps be arranged as follows:— Paym knts. England. India. £ £ Seistan.. 800 Kerman 400 4^0 Buwler Abbas # # 500 Kurun .. 400 400 Kermanshah 500 Urumia 500 Bam[&gt;ur 500 Bahrein 500 Ispahan and Tabreez 700 Total 2.500 3,100 Savings. Karun subsidy .. 1.000 1,000 Sh raz .. 160 Kerman 250 250 Kermanshah 24 Mohammerah 490 Resht .. 300 Total 2,040 1,434 The total cost to Her Majesty’s Government, therefore, would be 460/. a-year, and to the Government of India 1,666/. a-year. ‘If we find it necessary to keep native agents on the Karun, and between Seistan and Meshed, these totals would be slightly increased. To aid the work of our Consular officers and traders we want better roads within our zone. I suggested in 1895 that an officer might be useful in Shuster to aid in the opening of the roads in the Lur and Bakhtiari country, and we have kept these objects steadily in view. The road through the Bakhtiari country from Ahwaz to Ispahan is now making progress. I hope to march over it in a few weeks hence. After doing so I hope to return through the Lur country, and, if possible, to open the road from Dizful to the north. It is very desirable that our Karun trade should have an outlet northwards, and that the Sultanabad and Kurdistan carpets, and the Hamadan and Kermanshah exports, should be able to get out by the Karun. The carpets now go largely by Resht and Russia. In other directions we may be able to get roads made or improved as time goes on. The newly-appointed Governor of Shiraz, who seems13 toS very friendly, has promised me that he will do his utmost for the Shiraz-Bushire road, and he may possibly do something. An attempt is now being made to establish cart traffic between Sultanabad and Tehran, and the Imperial Bank of Persia have obtained the concession for a road from Kum to Ispahan. The advantage of this latter road to our trade is, however, doubtful. What we want above all is good roads from the point where our ships unload to the limits of our zone. Ibis leads me to a point which I think we should consider seriously. Since I have been in Persia I have tried to estimate the possibilities of a successful railway on various lines of country, but I have so far failed to discover a likely opening. It is conceivably possible, however, that careful examination by an expert misdit reveal a route which would prove a commercial success. I understand that the Government of India do not now favour the idea of a railway from Quettah to Seistan. The Russians are at this moment anxious about an alleged Concession to an English Syndicate for a railway from Bunder Abbas to Shiraz. Such a line could not, I think, pay its expenses. A route might possibly be found from the Karim to Ispahan and the north. The Bagdad line seems to offer a chance. The Germans have done no work on this road, and their Concession, unless secretly renewed, has in reality lapsed. I shall endeavour, if a chance occurs, to get some hold on this road, without incurring any embarrassing obligations. It seems to me that it might possibly be worth while to send from India an officer accustomed to the work of frontier lines to look over the several routes and make suggestions. His journeys might, of course, excite the suspicion of the Russians, hut I do not know that this would do much harm. In the meantime, I presume that Her Majesty’s Government would prefer that the Persian Agreement with Russia prohibiting railway construction should not be renewed. It expires this year. I am not at all sure that the Russians wish to renew it, for it seems easier for them to build railways than for any one else; but I should be glad to know the views of Her Majesty’s Government. I was consulted about the matter once (see my despatch No. 61 of the 12th April, 1898), and the late Sadr-i-Azarn then assured me that the Shah was very much opposed to the renewal of the Agreement. There is one more agency which we ought to employ to strengthen our Consular stall. I have already explained the position of the Telegraph Department in Persia and on the Persian Gulf. I am using it now to some extent as a means of obtaining intelligence, and it has at times been very useful in this way; hut it should be made useful in other ways as well. Wherever we have a Consul or Vice-Consul, as at Kermanshah, Ahwaz, or Kerman, we ought to have an efficient telegraph line. The line in these places is thoroughly inefficient, and in Seistan there is no line at all. We can do something by pressing the Persian Government to repair and restore, and at times by lending efficient signallers, and by deputing officers to inspect and advise. These things must be done with tact I but so far the Persian Government seems to have entertained no jealousy of our Telegraph Department, which, on the contrary, has always been regarded with favour. It is difficult to make exact proposals with reference to this point, because circumstances vary so much in different places; but, speaking generally, it seems desirable to spend some trouble, and money if necessary, in getting the Persian telegraph system into our hands as much as possible. We should try to construct the proposed land line from Kashan to the Kelat frontier, and should connect it, or get the Persian Government to connect it, through Seistan with Meshed. Eventually it should also be connected with the coast. I think we ou^ht also to pay our Director better than we do. He ranks here next to the Minister, and he cannot maintain his position on a salary of 950/. a-year. The Manager of the Imperial Bank gets more than three times this sum. It is' important that the Director should be on good terms with the Persian Ministers and Notables, and be able to entertain them to some extent, and he should also he able to move about the countrv decently equipped. I will go into this matter separately and in detail, if the Government of India are prepared to accept the principle that the Telegraph Depart ment should be regarded in some sense as a political organization, and that some expense may legitimately be incurred to make it more efficient in that respect. I have now stated the main proposals which I have to make for improving our position in Persia. It is briefly that we should increase the numbers and efficiency of our Consular staff by the addition of certain Consulates and Vice-Consulates, and by improving the position of our Representatives in Tabreez and Ispahan ; that we should open out roads in the Karun district and elsewhere, and possibly prospect for a 13921 ‘ ^ Rrailway; and that we should organize the Telegraph Department for political purposes. But, as I said before, this despatch should be regnrded as supplementary to my Memorandum of 1895. which went fully into the question of our position in Persia. I would again request that reference may be made to that Memorandum, and that the proposals therein put forward may he considered. There are one or two to which I should like to refer again. In the penultimate paragraph I wrote:— “ The Persian Government should be made to understand that they must not trifle with us in the future as they have occasionally done in the past, but we should try to gain their goodwill, and help them in any way we can.” In a former paragraph I had explained how the Persians, relying on our forbearance, were inclined at times to treat us with disregard, and I suggested that we should take certain measures to correct their attitude in this respect. I recommended that, on the other hand, a loan should be granted to Persia upon easy terms. I think we should adhere to the principle of these recommendations. At present the Persians think we have lost interest in things Persian; that we will do nothing for them ; and that we will not take the trouble to resent anything they do against us. I should like to disabuse their minds of both of these ideas. I may perhaps with advantage give one or two instances of what I mean, f noticed in my Memorandum of 1895 the case of the Island of Siri, which the Persians occupied some years ago, and have since retained in spite of our protest. I noticed also the case of the Perso- Beluchistan border, where the Persians were constantly encroaching, and I explained the necessity for exercising some check upon the selection of Governors in the south of Persia. In these two latter cases we have succeeded in changing the attitude of the Persian Government. The border has been delimited, and in a recent instance an obnoxious Governor was recalled from Bushire on our demand. This has done much good. But cases still occur in which our interests and our representations are treated with small respect. Por example, the Persian Government, during my absence on leave, asked the Military Attache in this Legation to arbitrate in an important dispute between our native Agent in Kermanshab and some Persian subjects. The Persian Foreign Minister undertook in writing to execute the Award, whatever it might be. The Award was given in December 1897, and, in spite of continuous pressure from the Legation, execution has been evaded up till now r , every sort of frivolous pretext being advanced to put us off. In another arbitration case which occurred during my absence on leave, Mr. Hardinge agreed to abide by the Award of the Prime Minister. The Award provided for the transfer of certain mines from the possession of a British-protected subject, and the payment to him of certain sums of money which he had given as presents to the Foreign Minister and other high officials. The mines were at once transferred, but the money has never been paid. Again, the Imperial Bank of Persia has, by its Concession, the exclusive right of issuing bank notes, yet bank notes have for years been issued in large numbers by certain Persian Associations, and though many representations have been made on the subject, the practice continues unchecked. I have just heard that several thousand notes have been printed in England on behalf of one of these Associations, and that they are now on their way to Bushire. I shall submit these cases separately for orders, and in the meantime I do not ask for any general ruling or assurance on the part of Her Majesty’s Government with regard to our future treatment of such matters, but I have thought it desirable to bring the point to notice, in order that the attitude of the Persian Government towards us may be clearly understood. On the other hand, if the Persians are again anxious for a loan, and if they can satisfy us that the money will be properly spent, and not “ eaten ” by the chief officials, I would secure them a loan on easy conditions, relying for the payment of instalments not on material guarantees of the usual type, such as would satisf} 7 the Stock Exchange, but on the great power we have of putting pressure upon the Persian Government. To insist upon material guarantees of the usual type is, I fear, to defeat our object. In the despatch from the Government of India of the 11th August, 1898, the following passages occur :— “ The recent arrangement whereby receivers of the Imperial Bank of Persia were to encash all customs duties at Bushire and Kermanshah, and to have also the right to see that the duties are duly levied, appears likely, if established, to prove an important step towards developing the natural resources of Persia and increasing British influence.”“ We have recently heard of the resignation of the Amin-ed-Dowleh, on whom the title of Sadr-i-Azam was conferred as lately as last December, and from whom and from his colleagues so much was apparently hoped for in the direction of reforms. We are as yet without precise information as to the significance or cause of the Sadr-i- Azam’s resignation.” The fact is that the cause of the late Sadr-i-Azam’s resignation, or rather removal, was precisely the arrangement for the control of the customs duties. Unable to find any money for the daily expenses of the Shah and the conduct of the Administration, and feeling that his retention in power depended upon his doing so, the unfortunate Sadr-i-Azam very reluctantly accepted the offer of a small loan from the Imperial Bank, and put their receivers in charge of the customs. The measure was intensely unpopular among the Persian merchants, who had to pay their customs dues, and among the officials at head-quarters, who resented the interference of the Eeringi. The Sadr-i-Azam was loudlv denounced for having ‘'sold Bushire to the English,” and in a few weeks he was dismissed from office. He is now living in seclusion at Tehran, never leaving his house, and his lifelong rival, the Amin-es- Sultan, who is opposed to all reform, and was strongly supported by the Bussians, has been appointed Sadr-i-Azam in his place. In my Memorandum of 1895 I explained the great difficulty of effecting any reforms, notably in the customs system, and I added:— “ By pressing for them inconsiderately, we run the risk not only of failure, but of making ourselves disliked by the Shah and Sadr-i-Azam and other influential persons, and of driving them into the arms of Russia.” These words are just as true now as they were in 1895, and I would earnestly recommend that we should act with great caution in these matters. If we contemplate at any time helping the Persians to a loan, we should aAmid insisting upon the immediate control of the custom-houses. A clause providing that control will be given if the instalments on the loan are not paid is, 1 think, the utmost that we require. The custom-houses at Bushire, Lingah, and Bunder Abbas, through which passes yearly over 3,000,000/. of trade, lie under the guns of our ships, and we could at any time put a boat’s crew and a bank agent in possession of each, even if we had no Agreement at all. In my opinion, therefore, we can guarantee a loan, and thus let Persia have money at very low interest, and put her under a real obligation without any appreciable risk. I hope that this view of the case may be considered by Her Majesty’s Government, and that we shall, in the case of another loan being contemplated, rely on our power rather than on material guarantees. I doubt whether that power is fully recognized by ourselves. The Persians have no doubt of it. They see that our frontier, that is, the frontier of Kelat and the sea, not to speak of Afghanistan, marches with theirs for 1,500 miles. They know very well that the Russians cannot help them in the south and south-east, and that in the Gulf Provinces such show of authority as they still exercise depends upon our forbearance, if not upon our support.- For example, the port of Lingah is now in possession of a revolted Arab Sheikh, whom the Persians have recognized as Governor. They have no power to coerce him, and begged me to send a gun-boat to do so. He would most gladly hoist our flag to-morrow. On the Karun also the Arabs are in possession, and ready at a word from us to throw off the semblance of Persian supremacy. The Gulf ports Mohammerah, Bushire, Lingah, and Bunder Abbas are at the mercy of our ships. So great is the respect of the Persians for our power that even in the extreme north of our zone, among the fanatical town-bred population of Ispahan, any demonstration cn our part has immediate effect. Two or three years ago there was trouble in Ispahan, and the Mollahs were stirring up mischief against the Europeans. It happened that at this moment a British squadron was sent into Turkish waters, and news of the movement was brought to Persia by the public telegrams. The Missionary Bishop at Ispahan wrote to inform me that the hostile demonstrations against the Europeans had ceased at once, and that the attitude of the Mollahs had completely changed. He said that the change was caused by the news about our fleet, which was apparently interpreted as an indication that the English were getting angry. Almost equal sensitiveness was shown last year when the news of the battle of Omdurman became known. It spread like wildfire all over the country, and was the common subject of conversation not only at the capital*but in remote villages of Persian Beluchistan, where the markedly respectful attitude of the people attracted the notice of our officers. I mention these facts to show that we are greatly feared in |392] F16 Persia, and that consequently we can with ease make our wishes respected. The reason why the Persians often disregard them is what I have mentioned before, that they think our forbearance is practically unlimited. But whenever they see that we are in earnest, and that Her Majesty’s Government is interested in a ease, the Shah and his Ministers speedily became convinced of the necessity for meeting our wishes. I would ask Her Majesty’s Government to believe that we have still great power and reputation in Persia. Having such power we can afford both to be decided in insisting upon our legitimate interests and to be sympathetic and easy in our terms if the Persians ask us for help, pecuniary or other. We can also do something to check Russian encroachments. In my Memo randum of 1895 I suggested our letting it be understood that aggressive action by Russia in the north of Persia would immediately result in decided action by us in the south. I still think that this is our proper policy. I do not mean that we should bully or unduly threaten the Persian Government, but I would let them understand that we cannot regard without concern any such action as, for example, the pushing down of the Russian sanitary w r edge towards Seistan, and that we shall, if these things happen, ask for compensations which the Persian Government may dislike. It is easy to do this, and it may help the Persian Government to resist demands which otherwise they would find it difficult to avoid accepting. I think they should realize that any serious concession made in the north is likely to involve an equivalent concession in the south. Hitherto they have realized only the converse of the pro position. I fully recognize that it may be embarrassing for us to commit ourselves beforehand to any particular method of action, but the principle should be under stood. If Her Majesty’s Government do not give me orders to the contrary, this is the line I propose to take jn the future. Similarly, to turn to another clause of my recommendations of 1895, if Her Majesty’s Government do not give me orders to the contrary I propose, in the event of the Shah’s death, to recognize provisionally the succession of the Valiahd, as I did three years ago. I may now perhaps usefully recapitulate what I have written regarding the state of Persia in 1899, and the steps which should be taken to improve our position in the country. The internal condition of Persia is exceedingly bad, worse in some respects than in 1895. The finances are in greater disorder, the troops and civil establishments are unpaid, food is dear, the Shah is a weak Ruler who maintains no discipline, and his Prime Minister has no powers, so that there is practically no Government. The Russians have shown considerable activity in the northern provinces, pushing on roads, and energetically encouraging their trade, and making use of their missionaries among the Christian populations. They have put “ sanitary ” posts along the Afghan border, and have tried to establish their trade and influence in Seistan. They have also established a Consulate at Ispahan. Nevertheless, the internal condition of Persia is by no means hopeless, her debt being practically nothing, and her resources considerable; and although Russia has been active in some respects we still hold a strong position. Our trade and our influence are completely dominant up to the Khanikin-Seistan line; and though our trade has suffered in the north it is still alive Our bank does business all over Persia, and is the only bank that can legally issue notes. Our Telegraph Department controls a large part of the Persian telegraph system. Our political influence is still great, even in the north, and our power is much feared. Still it cannot he denied that our position is threatened. To maintain and improve it we should increase by five or six the number of our English Consular officers, and should encourage them all to travel and know their districts. We should also improve the condition of our Consulates at Tabreez and Ispahan. We should try to open out new trade routes, and to make those which exist a little better than they are. Possibly, we might prospect for a railway. We should also make more use of our Telegraph Department, trying to get into our hands as much of the Persian telegraph system as possible, and to have all our Consular posts in effective communication with Tehran. We should insist upon our interests being specially considered within our zone—that is, up to the Khanikin—Seistan line. Amongst other things, we should exercise some unofficial control over the appoint ment and dismissal of the Persian Governors. We should be strict in keeping the Persians to their engagements, and resisting injustice; but, on the other hand, having the power to coerce Persia very easily, we should be considerate in our dealings with her if she wants help, and, under certain circumstances, we should guarantee a loanfor her, refraining at the same time from taking material guarantees of an unpalatable description, or forcing upon her reforms for which she is not prepared. We should decide now to recognize the Shah's eldest son if the Shah dies. ‘Finally, we should let it be clearly understood that encroachment by Russia in the north will entail concessions to us in the south. In conclusion, I think it will be as well to notice two objections which may be brought against these proposals : „ The first is, that if we already have in Persia a larger Consular staff than the Russians, as the sketch map shows, there seems to be no necessity for our increasing it. There is force in this objection; but the fact remains that the Russians are pushing our trade out of Northern Persia, and that they have begun to touch the northern fringe of our zone. The second objection which may be urged is that our action would be resented by the Russians, and would lead to counter-moves on their part. I fully recognize the force of this objection. No one can have realized more clearly than I have done the inexpediency of provoking Russia by an appearance of over-activity. I have repeatedly impressed this view upon our officers in Persia, and my Memorandum of 1895 and later despatches—notably, that of the 14th August, 1896—show how constantly the idea has been present to my mind. Nothing can be more foolish than fussy demonstra tions, or attempts to gain small successes at the expense of the Russians, and, except when active measures are necessary for the maintenance of our material interests, I would never advocate them. 1 have throughout recognized that our proper course in this country is to stand on the defensive, and to avoid striking at the Russians, or performing any risky evolutions which might tempt them to fall upon us. But, at the same time, it seems to me that there must be limits to our caution in these respects, and that, if we are to maintain our position in Persia, we must be prepared to face a certain amount of displeasure on the part of the Russians. As I have shown in this despatch, they do not remain inactive because we do so. Our abstention, at the instance of the Government of India, from interference in Seistan, has not prevented them from pushing down to the Afghan frontier and trying to strangle our Indian trade, or from endeavouring, with some success, to establish their trade and influence in Seistan itself. Our studious friendliness in Tehran though pleasantly reciprocated, does not prevent them from doing all they can to injure our hank, the Russian Banque des Prets getting up runs upon it, and even the Russian Legation refusing its notes. Nor has our friendly attitude prevented them from establishing a Consulate in Ispahan, or pushing on the construction of the Resbt road. Whether we remain quiet or not the Russians, very properly, go on working for their own hand, and unless we make an effort sooner or later we shall find ourselves being quietly elbowed out of one position after another. If we do make the effort now we certainly may provoke them to increased activity, but it may have a contrary effect, and in any case I beliefe that if we keep strictly within our rights, and make no unnecessary demonstrations, we have no need to be afraid of what they can do. They ought not to be able to meet us on equal terms in our zone. Every Persian believes that sooner or later the country will be divided between England and Russia, and the southerner from Zil-es-Sultan downwards, looks to coming under the rule of England. In a loose-knit country like Persia, the weak Central Government cannot easily over-ride local influence. In this respect it is fortunate for us that ihe Persians have fixed their capital so far north as Tehran. Even in Tehran, moreover, the influence of the Russians has its limits. Their geographical position makes them a threatening power in the north, and as most of the Government officials at Tehran are northerners, with property and interests in the north, the influence of the Russians in Tehran is no doubt considerable. The northern official thinks it wise to keep on good terms with his future masters. But it must be remembered that the Persian lives from day to day, and thinks the country will probably last his time, and, being inordinately conceited, not to say arrogant, the Persians are far from liking the Russians, whose overbearing ways they find it hard to endure. Although the Russians are not omnipotent in Tehran—on the contrary, although the Persian Government is very much afraid of them, it still opposes to them a steady, passive resistance about which they complain very bitterly. The Shah and his advisers, who believe that we shall take the south only if Russia takes the north, will go as far as they dare in helping us to resist Russian encroachment, and if we show that we are in earnest I think they will go a long way. It must not be thought that they are entirely under Russian domination. They are not. Therefore in my opinion we should make up our mindslaananaEB ssESsasEcsssaaes Aim U ! that the time has come for us to lay down a definite line of policy in Persia, and that for the future we must adhere to it without too much regard for any displeasure which we may thereby cause to the Russians.

He also submits further suggestions which form part of a general scheme of policy, based upon examination of the current state of affairs in Persia in 1899. The principal changes which have taken place since 1895 are outlined regarding: succession, government, finance, Russian trade and political influence, and British trade.Diplomatic, Political and Consular staff in Persia are listed with costings, and suggestions are provided for places where the appointment of consular officers would be desirable, including the limits of their districts and an estimate of expenditure which the appointments would entail. He also proposes to: improve roads and possibly prospect for a railway, utilise the Telegraph Department and organise it for political purposes, grant a loan to Persia to foster goodwill, and check Russian encroachments.The file notes the enclosure of a sketch map; however this is not present and has not been bound into the file.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Iran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Indo-European Telegraph Department</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Persia</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Telegraph lines</topic></subject><subject><topic>Consular services</topic></subject><subject><topic>Trade (practice)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Foreign affairs</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x0000e5#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
