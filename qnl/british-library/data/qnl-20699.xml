(T 16430/1^11^380) Dear Harrison, FOREIGSI GIT ICE, S. .1. 17th October, 1946. .3 I ar»-i replying to your letter to Clarke of the 26th August last about status of the waters of Koweit Bay. Since the question was last discussed in 1940, the question of the exploitation of dll deposits situated outside territorial waters, but in close proximity to the coast, has been the subject of considerable discussion, and the tendency now is to regard it as relat ed rather to the ownership of the sea bed than to that of the waters above, which questions are governed in international law by widely different principles. It is possible therefore that the right to exploit oil in Koweit Bay may be determined independently of the status of the waters of the Bay, but this matter is still awaiting decision, and in the meantime it would be well to assemble all available evidence in support of the view that Koweit Bay^ is a territorial inlet belonging to Ko./eit, The kind of evidence required is broadly indicated in paragraph 4 of the Admiralty letter of the 12th June 1940, in which they say that the claim to regard Kowcit Bay as a , territorial inlet would rest not only on configuration but also on the grounds that territorial rights are necessary for defence and neutra-lity and that the Bay is secluded from normal traffic routes. The Admiralty seemed to assume that there would be no difficulty in establishing the territorial status of the Bay on these grounds. It would be very helpful nevertheless if concrete evidence of the long standing exercise of jurisdiction over the waters of the Bay could be produced in the shape of laws for the control of navigation over the whole bay, within the limits indicated in tne Admiralty letter, such as laws and regulations regarding customs, lighting, buoying, harbour and other dues, fisheries, etc., especially if thuse have been applied without protest to forei gn vessels using the Bay, F.

IAN CULF RESIDENCY r fe r The Hon'ble Lt -Col.W. H.Kay, CSI. ,012., Persian Gkilf Residency, Bahrein.FOREIGN OEPICE, S.W.I. 26th February, 1947. We have been considering your letter No.Ext.85/47 of the 11th January about the legal character of the waters of Koweit Bay, and whether any steps can be taken and by whom, to estaolish the status of the bay as an 'historical' bay,, There are various things the Sheikh of Koweit could do to affirm the national status of the bay, namely (1) enact a law saying that the bay is Koweit national v/aters, (2) to take more definite action, without enacting any law, indicating that the Sheikh does claim the bay as his national waters e .g. by issuing notices or regulations indicating that certain provisions oi existing laws, and so forth, which apply to Koweit territory apply to this bay, (3) to issue a regulation about fishing in Koweit Bay, reserving it, if that is what is always done, to Koweit nationals. Any law issued under (1) should make it clear that it is merely declaratory of the position as it always has been. The above list is not, of course, exhaustive. One thing the Sheikh can do, without bringing the 'continental shelf' question into it, is to tell the concessionary company that his territory does extend to the mouth of the Bay, and give his definition of the bay, I am sending copies of this letter to Dodds at the Admiralty and Parrell at the Ministry of Fuel and Power, Yours &amp;c., E,P, Donaldson, Esq,, G, iLG-, , India Office, (Sd) R, Dunbar,CONFIDENTIAL ' n o.

Ext.461/47, «i«ted the 12th March, 1947, I am not in favcur of the firft two auggootiona in Dunbar's letter. There is no established process in Kuwait for enacting laws and if the Bhaikh were to take the present opportunity for establishing such a practice much undesirable publicity and comment would be likely to ensue. With regard to the third suggestion alanj or nctlces have been Issued by Shaikhs in the past cf. Shaikh Mubarak 1 s alaoa published as Nos. 3B and 3C in the collection of Treaties and Engagements in force between the British Government and the Hulers of Kuwaitj 1841 • 1913. Even so, I consider that for the Shaikh to publish such an slAik the present case out of the blue and not as a result or any specific incident aight again cause undesirable comment. If, however, it is considered essential that the Shaikh should publish something in writing to establish Kuwait's claim to the bay this is the best course to recommend to him. 3, I see no objection to the proposal in the c third paragraph of Dunbar's letter and I recommend that we should Inform the Kuwait Oil Company In writing that hit territory Includes the whole of the Bay up to Its mouth which should be defined as In paragraph 6 of Admiralty letter No 11.05357, dated the 12th June, 1940, a copy of which was enclosed with Peel's deal official letter to Prior Ho.

We agree that the Koweit Oil Go. should now be infomed in writing (either by the Sheikh himself or by the Political Agent, with the concurrence of the Sheikh, as you think best) that the Sheikh's territory includes the whole of the Bay up to its mouth, as defined in para graph 5 of the Admiralty letter of 12th June, 1940. We appreciate the difficulty of the Sheikh issuing Alans 'out of the blue', but at the same time these would be a useful means of consolidating the position, and the Koweit authorities would be wsll advised to be on the watch for ary suitable occasions for issuing Alans in respect of the Bey. ^- ^ ^ PEFT^ r r '1F rESHENCY NO...
