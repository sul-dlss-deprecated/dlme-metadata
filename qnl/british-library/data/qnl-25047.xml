Their ohiections to this project were indicated in Mr. Bradley s letter No. 524, dated the 18th October 1907, and the only condition upon which they were then prepared to withdraw their opposition was that the line should be constructed upon the same terms as regards management, maintenance and working as are in force in the case of the existing Pondicherry Railway. The Government of Madras do not know why these terms were not acceptable to the French Government, hut they are not disposed to do anything to facilitate the construction of a line which must he prejudicial to British interests m this Presidency unless they are assured that some substantial^advantage is to be obtained by the sacrifice of those interests. The Governor in Council is no fully informed of the precise scope and nature of the negotiations now proceed- im?between the British and French Governments, and he must content himself wRh impressing on the Government of India and His Majesty’s Government that the^construction of this line will be advantageous to French and prejudicial tc Brhish hiterSts in South India, and that no concession regarding its conftructon or management should be made without adequate compensation 19th April 1911.FOR INFORMATION.No. 824, dated Bushire, the 1st (received 10th) April 1911 (Confidential).

Chief In continuation of my secret telegram, dated the 21st instant, on the subiect of the maximum cession of territory which the Madras Government would now be prepared to make to the French, I am directed to say that the Madral Government are willing to cede territory in the neighbourhood of Pondicherry e *j, tellt s P ecifi ed in the statement annexed to this letter, which shows also details ot area, population and revenue. The situation of the area in question is shown on the accompanying map of the taluk of Villupuram in the 1 South Arcot ihstrict. The western boundary of the territory now proposed to be ceded is marked m red pencil; the southern boundary is formed by the Ponnaivar river, and thus includes the villages of Cuddalore taluk entered in the statement appended to the letter from the Collector of South Areot which formed au enclo sure to our letter No. 205, dated the 30tU April 1910; the eastern boundary is the existing Trench territory and the Bay of Bengal; while the northern limits are formed by the Villupuram-Tindivanam taluk boundary. 2.

It will be observed that the present proposal involves the sacrifice of nearly 4 lakhs of revenue, to which must be added District Board revenue of about Rs. 20,000 (at one anna in the rupee of land revenue), besides an indefi nite amount for Stamps, Salt, Customs, &amp;c. On the other hnnd, there will be some reduction of expenditure on Police and Village establishments and on Local Board work, and a gain of territory and revenue from the cession to Madras of Karikal, Mahe and Yanaon. The Governor in Council must repeat the stipulation made in paragraph 4 of Sir William Meyer’s letter No. 205, dated the 30 th April 1910, that any net loss of revenue to the Madras Presidency, which would result from the exchanges now under discussion, shall be made up by an assignment from Imperial funds. 4. The limits of the territory which this Government is now prepared to surrender have been determined with reference to the convenience of retain ing the river Ponnaiyar as a good natural boundary between British and Prench territory, and also with regard to the administrative importance of keeping the South Indian Railway and the road which runs nearly parallel to it well within British territory. While, however, no administrative incon venience need be anticipated from the proposed cession, the Governor in Council has reason to believe that any cession of territory would he extremely distasteful to the inhabitants of the villages to be transferred, and he would therefore urge that the actual area ceded should be as small as the course of the negotiations will permit. 5. The Madras Government are not aware what direction these negotia tions will actually take, or what are the precise considerations which will influ ence their settlement; and they have therefore merely indicated the extent of concession beyond which they would prefer not to go. But if, as is possible, Imperial interests of high importance should demand a still larger surrender thanSifiTl [ftP* Document is the Property of His Britannic Jfl^eaty’a Government! ARMS TRAFFIC.

GAMBON mentioned to me to-day that, when he went to Paris next Sunday, amongst the things which he would discuss with M. Cruppi would he the question of Muscat. I told him that we had been looking into the matter. I had discussed it with Mr. liarcourt, and his view was that we could not bring the Gambia into the negotiations. The Indian Government would, however, he prepared to give the Trench some territory near Pondicherry, in return for Chandernagore. M. Gambon might consider what other concessions there were which we could make in return for Muscat. M. Gambon urged very strongly that no mere accession of territory round Pondicherry would be accepted by Trench opinion as sufficient compensation for the cession of Ghandernagore. He argued with force that the Gambia was of little value to us, except from the point of view of sentiment. To this I replied that the sentiment was very strong, and we felt that we could not part with the Gambia except in return for a price greater than Trench sentiment was likely to agree to. ; . M Gambon said that the Trench sentiment as to Chandernagore was as strong, if not stronger, and the name of Dupleix would certainly be invoked. He pointed out that Muscat would be of increased value to us when a settlement was leached with regard to the Bagdad Bailway, and this might happen before long. ~ I have, &amp;c. E. GBEY.

In continuation of the correspondence ending with my telegram No. Ill No. 146, dated the 28th February 1911, from Mr. E. G. Gregson. No. 14)6, dated Bushire, the 28th February (received 13th March) 1911. From—E. G. Gregsom, Esq., Superintendent of Police, on special duty, under Government of India, Foreign Department, c/o Punjab Bank, Karachi, To—The Hon'ble Lieutenant-Colonel Sir George Roos-Keppel, K.C I.E A&lt;*ent In continuation of my report No. 99, dated the 8th February 1911, I have the honour to draw attention to the very late arrival of the Afghans in the Persian Gulf this year. At one time it seemed that no Afghans intended com ing down at all, hut during the last few weeks large bodies of Afghans are reported to be moving down to the Vlekran coast. There is no room for doubt ing that these men are coming only for arms and have apparently not con sidered it necessary to come down on the pretext of trading with Bunder Abbas. They are all said to he well armed and have quantities of ammunition and they are further reported to be bringing down considerable numbers of camels with out loads. From the above facts two inferences have been drawn : the first is that they are determined to get arms at any price and that they will fight if necessary; while, on the other hand, there is a belief that arms have already been collected in considerable quantities well inland, either by being smuggled during the hot season or autumn in small quantities across the Persian Gulf or from the inhabitants of the country. If this supposition is correct, they will turn back without appearing on the coast at all. In support of this theory there is the mysterious disappearance of a caravan last autumn ; it was reported well on its way down to Bunder Abbas, when it suddenly turned back, but nothing has ever been ascertained as to where it went to. This might happen if they obtained their arms well inland and returned to Afghanistan. The leaders of the Afghans now on their way to the Gulf are Ghulam Khan, Nasir of village Sur Nasir near Kandahar and Khalifa Khair Muhammad. Should the Afghans reach Mir Barkat, late Governor of Biaban, before he decides to come to terms with us, the situation may become serious. The latest reports are that Afghans have been sent to Barkat. In any ease as long as large numbers of Afghans are present in Mekran no reliance whatsoever can be placed in Mir Barkat; it would be impossible for him to act in co operation with us for the suppression of the arms traffic, as the Afghans would be a continual menace to him. In consultation with Captain Craufurd I have sent Inspector Khem Chand to Charbar and will shortly proceed there myself as at present it seems likely to he a centre of the Afghan operations. The above facts have from time to time been reported by Mr. Gumbley and have been corroborated by those I have received from Bunder Abbas. It is also rumoured that Ali Khan of Maskat arranged for the Afghans* arrival to coincide with the close of the financial year, the 31st March, as he had private information that the blockade would be raised on that date. • Serial No. 5. dated the 13th March* 1911, I have the honour to forward a copy of a letter to the Governor-General and Chief Commissioner, North West-Frontier Province, Peshawar.9 2. An informer was disembarked at night at Kishm by II. M. S. “Alert” and be is travelling up to Lingah from there. I think it more than possible that a feint will be made; Afghans appearing with camels and in large bodies on one par*^ of the coast while arms are run across in the opposite direc tion. Although there are not at present many signs of activity between Bunder f Abbas and Lingah, the locality seems well situated for smuggling and there are some few Afghans continually moving about who seem very busy I have \ asked Captain Biscoe and Mr. New to arrest these men at the first opportunity and to send them down to India. 3. Two captures of arms have been made by my staff on the slow mail steamers; Inspector Khem Chand seized two rifles (Mauser) and four hundred rounds on S. S. Goalpara, and Head Constable Ghulam Hussain a Mauser rifle and two hundred rounds on S. S. Warounga, Sayed Abdul Kahar of Maskat is said to arrange for the smuggling of arms by steamers at Maskat, This information is being sent to the Political Agent at Maskat. 4. Saddo who was deported to India —vide paragraph 3 of my letter No. 970» dated the 12th December 1910, is reported to have left three hundred rifles with his Persian wife in Bunder Abbas. 5. The following persons are said to be engaged in smuggling arms on the Island of Kishm:— (1) Haji Ahmed Saleh, (2) Mir Hashim, and (3) Ali Yahya. This information has been communicated to His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Bunder Abbas. 6. From enquiries at Bombay I have ascertained that the last pilgrim ship will return in April from the Haj, so that it will be necessary to keep my men in Aden until then to prevent possible trans-shipments to the Gulf from these steamers. € r, ' * . • .

Please refer to my telegram X dated the 3rd March. Latest information received by us does not confirm report of presence near the coast of 3,000 Afghans; their numbers are, however, undoubtedly large and include 100 horsemen which is new departure. We do not think it desirable to send strong expedition to proceed inland into Persia, and prefer to repeat plan adopted last year and, by landing troops when necessary, endeavour to cut otf any parties who may succeed in landing arms or who damage telegraph line. We would employ a force 1,000 strong, in two ships, to operate west and east, along the Shib Kuh and Mekran coasts, leaving all arrangements to Admiral. An accurate estimate of cost cannot be given, but it may be taken roughly at 2 lakhs rupees monthly. As the season is already advanced and gun-runners may now give trouble at any moment, wo should be glad to receive very early sanction. \ Repeated to Resident, Persian Gulf. Ends. The Director, Royal Indian Marine, has been instructed, in consultation with you, to submit proposals for transport, pending sanction of the Secretary of State. As soon as received from the Chief of the General Staff details regarding troops to be employed, &amp;c., will be sent to you.

Please refer to Marine Department telegram No. 115-106 M.,* dated the • Semi No 16 16th March 1911. The details of the force (for employment against gun-runners on the Mekran coast) are as follows: Units—32nd Mountain Battery, less one section; the 104th Wellesley’s Bifles; No. 19 Company, 3rd Sappers and Miners, less two sections; and two sections of No. 151 Indian Field Ambulance. Following are details of strength: British—22 officers, 6 non-commissioned officers and men, or a total of 28 ; Indian—20 officers, 6 Sub-Assistant Surgeons, 1,010 non-commissioned officers and men, or a total of 1,03 3; followers 170; Supply and Transport personnel 143; mules 456 ; guns— 4 mountain and 2 machine. On each ship there will be carried 20 days’ sea rations and 10 days* field service rations, including baled fodder for animals. Under the orders of the Quarter-Master General the following will also be provided, viz., 250 water tanks for mule carriage, each to hold 8 gallons, 1,450 one-gallon canvas chaguls, one field veterinary companion per ship, 2 months’ bazaar supplies, and 2 months* veterinary stores. Addressed to Admiral and repeated, with, the request that estimate of probable marine expenditure should be submitted urgently, to the Director, Royal Indian Marine, who should communicate with the Quarter-Master General regarding transport details. 19 Telegram P., No. 102 S., dated the 20th (received 21st) March 1911.

If Gregson could mention names of the sub-sections • Semi No. is. to the Ghilzais in Mekran belong, it might be desirable to baramta them in British territory and to select from them men of position in the tribe or relatives of the men in Mekran, but Gregson’s proposals are so vague that to carry them ^ out thoroughly would mean in the first place a baramta of most of the Ghilzais in the North-West Frontier Province and they number over 1,00,000. Merely to make a casual baramta on imperfect information of a certain number, taken at random, would probably be ineffectual as it is quite likely that the men thus arrested might be incapable of putting any pressure on the gun-runners m Mekran. I cannot support Gregson’s proposals in the absence of more definite inform*' ation.20 Telegram No. 27, dated the 20th March 1911. From—His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief, To—The Marine Department. The latest information regarding the distribution of Afghans, which is authentic, is contained in the following telegram from the Intelligence Officer, Jask, dated the 18th March -.-Begins. The present position regarding the Afghans is that there are in Lashar 300; between Hochan and Bint there are 200 • on the Upper Bapch 100, who are divided into four parties, ms., at Sokar 18, at Karkinder 32, at Sarhangi 30, at Chahan 20. The whole of the above are under Ghulam Khan. The 400 Afghans under Khair Muhammad Jan who were stated before to be at Sadaich are now reported to have moved on to road to Bandar Abbas via Bashkard, but their location has not recently been ascertained. There are other small parties from 50 to 100 scattered along the coast. There is a total of about 1,100 in Mekran. On the 11th March the Khalifa with about 500 men was to have left Hai- darabadfor Bampur. As regards the 1,500 Afghans reported on the 17th February by Central Persian line at Baluchab, nothing further has been heard. Ends. After consulting Captain Hunt of the “ Pox ”, which has arrived from the Persian Gulf at Bombay for repairs, I think that it is probable the Afghan will endeavour to remain in the coast districts during the ensuing hot season m the hope of getting arms through. At Maskat the price o ^ Es. 80, while in Mekran it is Es. 400 ; therefore it will pay the Alghans if they can only get about 25 per cent, through. ,, The notorious Nakhoda Sal Muhammad is on hoard which he is commanding, and which rs now running tinder pencil coiouw.

Delay in replying to your telegram S.—131 of 24th February is due to difficulty of obtaining any reliable information.

No. 324, dated Muskat, the 5th March 1911. From —Major A. P. Trevor, Political Agent and His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Maskat, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. In continuation of my telegram of the 4th instant on the subject of the stock of arms now in Maskat, I have the honour to submit herewith foi informa - tion a table shewing the estimated number of arras with the various dealers. It will be seen that the value of arms roughly estimated at 12 lakhs of rupees and that of the ammunition at 6 lakhs. 2. It is very difficult to obtain reliable information on the subject, as the dealers of course minimise their stocks when any enquiries are made from them and persons who are not dealers usually enormously exaggerate the quantities of arms and ammunition. I have, however, made as careful enquiries as possible in a short time, and think that the annexed table gives a reasonably approximate estimate of the stocks. It should however be remembered that thki is constantly fluctuating, both on account of variations m amount of stocks due to import and export, and also on account of violent fluctuations in price which take place when local stocks are low. 3 It will he seen that MM. Goguyer hold by far the largest stock, viz., about 18 000 arms and 5 million rounds of ammunition; not long ago they had over 20,000 arms of sorts. Ali Musa comes next with between nine and ten thousand arms and two and half million rounds of ammumton. 4 I have not classed pistols separately as there are very few in stock, and as the* only two classes stocked, viz.. Browning (average price Ks 20) and Mauser (average price Rs. 40) can be included m the medium class ol rifles the nrTc^of which vary from Rs. 25 to Rs. 40. As far as I can make out the stocks of Sniders, Gras and Werndl are not now and no rnany are beino imported, though the consignment ot 1,000 shewn against M.

Nicolson that the French Minlstere- concerned were of opinion that no arrangement could be reached in regard to the Muscat question which did not include the cession of the Gambia. They were ready to examine any proposals its to quid pro quos which His Majesty’s Government might desire to put before them. Monsieur Gumbo n added that a deal which was con fined to cessions of territory _n Inu-u could not be ’ placed before the French Chamber and was therefore inadmissible. I ten, with great truth and respect.. Dir, Your Excellency's most obedient, tie Excellency The Fight Honourable Sir F. Bertie, G.C.B., G.C.W.G., &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c. humble Dervant, C (Signed) W-«F India Office, 1st April 1911. * To Grovernor-Greneral, dated 29tli December 1910. From ditto, dated 30th January 1911. To ditto, dated 20th February 1911. From ditto, dated 25th March 1911. Sir, With reference to your Secret Letter No. 7846, of 3rd March, regarding negotiations about to be opened with the French Government for the ex tinction of all those French rights at Muscat under which the arms traffic is carried on, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to forward for the information of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs copy of telegrams* that have been exchanged with the Government of India on the subject. 2. Viscount Morley understands that it will be impossible to satisfy the desire of the French Government “ that the negotiations should embrace “ a wide field and should not be confined to any “ local exchange of advantages,” and that the burden of payment is therefore likely to fall mainly upon India. But before discussing what India has to offer he desires to place on record the following- general observations. 3. He is fully aware that the French rights are secured by Treaty and that they are a valuable consideration, the surrender of which it is not reasonable, as an ordinary matter of business, to expect except in exchange for another valuable consideration. But that is a doctrine which may easily be pressed too far ; and in Lord Morley’s opinion a Power that has rendered to civilisation such services as France has rendered has not the right—and His Majesty’s Government should be very careful not to admit any such right—to press that doctrine to its extreme limit. Even on the lower plane of an ordinary business transaction the right cannot be admitted without reservation. There is, it is true, a perfectly legitimate trade in arms at Muscat, for the extinction of which the French are entitled to full compensation. But it is important to remember that the legitimate trade would not pay by itself—as is shown by the fact that most of the dealers, when restricted to it by the activity of His Majesty’s ships, have been obliged to withdraw from the market; and it would be as unreasonable for the French Government to press a claim to compensation for the loss of the illegitimate trade as it would be for the owner of a public house to expect to be compensated for loss of profits that had accrued - The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office. S. 60. Abecause his premises were incidentally used for gambling purposes. It is further to be borne in mind that (as has often been stated befoie) although the distributing agency is mainly, if not entirely, French, the French manufacturing interest con cerned is very small. The figures for the last four years are as follows :— Total value of all arms and ammunition imported into Muscat. Value of French arms and ammunition. 1906-07. ]907-08. 1908-09. 112,338 279,050 237,644 5,995 26,343 19,914 It cannot therefore be argued that the extinction of the trade involves the dislocation of an important French industry: and, in fact, the damage falls far more heavily upon British industries, seeing that the value of arms of British origin for the same four years was 52,327L, 101,4321, 82,01 77., and 23,7857. severally. Lastly the value even of the distributing trade has been reduced to an insignifi- cent figure, and will be still further reduced, by the well devised measures of His Majesty’s Navy. 4. Lord Morley trusts that these considerations may be strongly urged upon the French Govern ment in mitigation of damages, and I am now to state what he is prepared, if necessary, to offer in behalf of India :— (1.) Territorial compensation. —(a) In their letter No. 88 (Secret), of 30th June 1910, the Government of India proposed the cession to France of villages in the neighbourhood of Pondicherry, covering au area of about 138 square miles (88,426 acres), with a population of 98,314, and bringing in a revenue of about 21 lakhs (18,3337.) a year. But they regarded the cession by France of Chandernagore and the other French possessions (except Pondicherry) and loges in India as an essential element in any such transaction. These settlements have an area of 88 square miles, and a population of about 99,000. In Lord Morley’s opinion this is a reasonable offer. In 1857, when a similar exchange of territory was under consideration, but no question of Muscat was involved, it was proposed to cede 65 British villages, covering an area of 60,759 acres, with a population of 36,195, and a revenue of Rs. 1,07,712. The difference, therefore, represents the price of Muscat under this head, (b) But from the Government of India’s telegram of 25th March it will be seen that they are now prepared to offer, if necessary, 140 villages, with an area of 216 square miles, population 160,000, and a revenue of about 4| lakhs.Beyond this, Lord Morley, who views the handing over of British subjects to France with extreme distaste, is in no circumstances prepared to go. (2.) Extradition. —In this connection I am to invite reference to Mr. Campbell’s letter of 23rd September last, and to say that his Lordship is prepared to agree to a modi fication or repeal of Article 16 of the Treaty of 1876 on the conditions mentioned in paragraph 5 of the Government of India’s letter No. 117, Secret, of 4th August last. (3.) For some years past the French have been anxious to build a railway from Pondicherry to Tirupapuliyur in British territory. The line would probably divert a certain amount of trade from British to French ports; and partly for this reason, and partly because of difficulties connected with construction, man agement, and rates, the Madras Government have not been able to accept the proposals of the French authorities. Lord Morley believes that a modus vivendi might be found, and is in communication with the Government of India on the subject. ( 4.) Direct money payment for existing stocks of arms at Muscat. —It appears from the Government of India’s telegram of 25th March that (leaving out of account certain small quantities lying unclaimed at the Custom house) the estimated value of these is about 18 lakhs (120,000L). 100,0001. would probably be sufficient to offer as a round sum. 5. These are the Indian assets, and, apart from any concessions that Sir E. Grey may have to propose in other regions, Lord Morley is of opinion that the first offer should not exceed (1) (a) and (4), it being clearly understood that the latter is in full satis faction of all claims whatsoever, whether of the French Government or of firms or individuals of French nationality or under French protection connected with the trade. If that proves insuffi cient, (2) and (3) should be offered in that order; but (1) (h) should be kept in reserve and not put forward except in case of extreme necessity. 6 The Government of India mention that the Political Agent at Muscat telegraphed on 4th tUoi fnrthpir lare^e Quantities of arms and o’rapn ox me icttei m-Chief, dated 18th February, regarding recent A. 2 S. 60.large imports of German arms. Germany has no treaty rights at Muscat, and Lord Morley trusts that any attempt to establish a German “ interest, whether commercial or political, will he firmly resisted. And with reference to paragraph of the Admiral’s letter, I am to point out the im portance of insuring that the Sultan of Muscat obtains a free hand to prohibit the import not only of manufactured ammunition, but also of the raw material. 7. I conclusion I am to say that nothing less than the complete extinction of French rights arising out of the Treaty of 1844 and the joint declaration of 1862 is worth any substantial sacri fice of territory, and Lord Morley trusts that the French Government will be under no misappre hension as to the power and intention of His Majesty’s Government to destroy the trade if these negotiations fail. f I hare the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, (Signed) R. Ritchie.NOTE BY PUBLIC WORKS SECRETARY. The construct ton of a line from Pondicherry to Ttrupapaliyur, on the South Indian Rp.ilway f was proposed by the Governor of Pondicherry so long ago as 1889, together with a line from Peralam to Karikal • The Government of In/dia, while not prepared themselves to construct the lines, or even the British portions, offered to assist a.ny company that might be formed by granting land free, by lending officers for surveying, and by allowing the branches to be worked by one of the existing Indian railways. They further obtained the agreement of the South Indian Railway Company to certain conditions of working. The Karikal line was proceeded with, both the const-ruction and working being carried out by the South Indian Raihoay Company. For some reason which does not appear in the papers available here, the Pondicherry Tirupapaliyur line was not proceeded with, but it is evident that there was no objection to it on the part of the Government of Indiaat that time. Nor do I gather that there is any strong opposition to its construction now. The objections token by the (Government of Madras are to the conditions proposed by the (Governor of Pondicherry that the South Indian Railway Company shall construct the line at a fixed price and under French control and jurisdiction and shall work it under French regulations. So far as regards construction the difficulties might be surmounted by each G-overnment constructing &amp; owning the portion in its own territory,the net earnings being divided in mileage or some other agreed proportion (The British section is understood ' to be only about li miles). The question of the working is less simple. The conditions required by the (Government of Madras may be too stringent. On the other hand those desired by the French Governor cannot '• apparently be agreed to. There would be nothing in them to object to if the line were confined to French territory and did not connect with the British railway system; but it is not reasonable that the French should bebe allowed the great advantage of a connection between the new line and the South Indian Railway while at the Game time retaining full control over the working of the new line and the rates charged on it. If the new line joins the South Indian Railway it will probably in any circumstances abstract traffic from that line and divert some trade from British ports to Pondicherry. This effect might be considerably intensified if the Pondicherry Government were able to control the rates to be charged on the new line. It appears to this Department that the new line should be worked by the South Indian, Railway Company on the general terms of the existing agreement for the working of the Karikal line. Under that agreement the French Governor has considerable powers of supervision and has a voice in the fixing of rates, subject to the condition that they shall not be less than the minimum in force on the South Indian Railway, The difficulty with regard to audit which is mentioned by the French Governor in his letter to the Governor of Madras dated 23rd23rd May 1907 might possibly be avoided by a modification of the financial terms of the agreement f e.g. by an arrangement that the South Indian Bailway Company shall work the line at actual cost. 1 regret that 1 am unable to suggest any modij ication of the Madras Government's terms that coulo in my opinion be offered to the French Government without reference to India; but if it is desired to pursue the matter I would suggest a telegram to India somewhat as follows:- Pondicherry-Tirupapaliyur raihvay - I gather chief objection is to control of rates by French authorities; can you suggest any partial concession? Would it be sufficient to stipulate that through rates between points on proposed railway and Cuddalore shall not be below South Indian Bailway Company's minimum rates;and could other difficulties be met by any arrangement under which construction and jurisdiction should be under British authorities in British territory only and net earnings be divided according to mileage or other arrangement.Mx:5fr, : 3 ft ■Sejesijt P COlMtii IS.

We are awaiting letter from Government of Madras, but have received a summary of their recommendations. (1) They are prepared to cede 140 villages round Pondicherry, revenue about 4| lakhs population 100,000 area 216 square miles. In 1857 it was proposed to cede 65 villages m Madras Presidency, covering an area of 60,759 acres with population .&gt;6,195, and a revenue of Rs. 1,07,712. Madras Government however would be glad to see the actual cession as small as possible as being distasteful to inhabitants o territory to be transferred, but should high imperial considerations necessitate it more territory north of Pondicherry could be ceded.

Foreign Secret. Your telegram dated 26th December. Arms traffic. I am addressing Foreign Office in sense of your remarks. Meanwhile it would be convenient to have your views on following points (1.) Territorial concessions proposed in Government of India’s secret letter No. 88 of 30th June. (2.) Whether anything less than complete freedom of Sultan to prohibit trade is worth having. (3.) And, if so, whether state monopoly, control of customs by Govern ment of India, or what other measure requiring French concurrence would be most effective and practicable from local point of view. (4.) Whether money compensation is admissible to local arms dealers or French Government. See Government of India’s telegram of 11th August. (5.) Any other points that occur to you. From Viceroy, 30th January 1911. foreign Secret. Arms traffic. Your telegram of 29th ultimo. With reference to question of territorial concessions I concur in views of Lord Minto s Government as stated in Secret Letter No. 88 of 30th June last. With reference to other questions raised in your telegram, after obtaining the opinions of the Naval Commander-in-Chief, Cox, and Political Agent at Maskat, following are my views. All our efforts and negotiations should aim at total prohibition of import and export, and nothing short of this will be of real advantage. State monopoly would be quite impracticable. It would probably be farmed to the highest bidder who might possibly be an arms dealer. Control of Customs by Government of India would not affect arms traffic question until the prohibition of imports has been arranged, after which some proper control over Customs might be necessary to render such prohibition effective, but Sultan would probably not accept Government control over Customs except under compulsion. With regard to question of compensation, provided arrangements are made under which Sultan can prohibit imports, it would be cheaper to buy up all stocks of arms at the market price than to maintain blockade which would be necessary if the export of existing stocks is to be prevented. This is the only form of direct compensation which should be entertained. If we begin discussing com pensation to traders or manufacturers or loss of prospective profits we should be embarking on a very large question in connection with which Maskat and British dealers, and even German and Belgian manufacturers, might clamour for equal treatment. We should adopt argument that although shipment has been legal destination of arms has been notoriously illicit, and that both dealers and manufacturers who have already made such heavy profits are deserving of no sympathy. As regards agreement which Sultan is believed to have entered into with certain of the dealers authorising them to import arms for a specified term of years, I think we could refuse to recognise them and leave persons concerned to get what redress they can from the Sultan. If an agreement with France should be found possible it must not be forgotten to come to terms with other Powers who have commercial treaties with Maskat.From Secretary of State to Viceroy, Foreign Department, 20th February 1911. t=r« maximum that India can give ?

J Sir I am commanded by my Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to transmit herewith, for the information of the Secretary of State for India in Council, a copy of letter No*127/1462 XIV K dated 18th February 1911 which has been received from the Commander-in-Chief, East Indies-, respecting the situation in the Persian Oulf.

Sir* Be pleased to lay before the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty the following report upon the general situation at present in the Persian Oulf. 2*- The arms traffic is almost entirely at a standstill and large consignments have not been landed in Persian territory for some considerable time, except perhaps in the neighbourhood of Bushiro. As far as can be ascertained, arms and ammunition landed there do not find their way into the hands of the Afghan traders, but are all absorbed in Persia itself, where there is a .large demand at the present moment. email consignments are smuggled across from time to time, but even these have ceased to a great extent since I authorise'} the burning of such hhov's as 'ere notoriously er^aa-eb in sfuT iling. 3.- Imports still continue to cone into Masqat, and there is a .greatly increased activity on the part of German exporters. They are sending rifles to Masqat at a price ,.hich undersells similar rifles already in stocV there, and there is. in consequence, considerable dissatisfaction amongst those dealers who hold large stocVs. 4 _ What the object of the German dealers is it is hard They may be dumping arms and ammunition | to say at present. mey v ho Secretary of the Admiralty.QO) there in the hopes of extracting large compensation from us in the event of a settlement being come to* or they may be working up a fictitious trade there so as to claim a right to step in and have a wrd in the final winding up of the ''hole business. Up to the present no German Agent has appeared in Masqat, oven Messrs ’^onckhaus being only represented by a native. 5 .- The principal demand is for ammunition, and T ive been informed on very credijtAle authority that the mt of ammunition is now beginning to be felt on the North ast Frontier. Cordite ammunition does not yet appear to be inufactured in the native factories in Afghanistan, and they r»e therefore dependent upon imports for the ammunition squired for their modern rifles. Tf they can obtain the w material for cordite or for any other nitro-ceHulose ^opellant, they will undoubtedly soon start manufacturerg )P themselves, and it wuld therefore appear desirable to ,e P a close watch upon the Indian Frontier to see that those iterial s are not exported, t .- Information has been received that a large caravan - Afghans, numbering 1,400 men, are reported to have arrived , Ourg. 270 miles North 3ast from Bandar Abbas, about the rarentlv are making for Bandar winning of February, and apparently are * ^ of 1,000 men had reached 5 bas Another caravan consisting of b rhahbar, about the same 18 ° coast.

Whatever they may intend to do* it will not be safe to withdraw any men from the garrisons in the Oulf or to seriously reduce the strength of the blockade until they have definitely left the coast on their return to Afghanistan. 7. — Under these circumstances I do not consider it to be advisable to reduce our forces in the Hulf until the hot weather has set in, when the lack of water and fodder will force the Afghans to withdraw inland again. It will thus be necessary to maintain the blockade until the beginning of June at least. 8. - As soon as it is practicable, I propose to pay off three launches, and to send the extra troops fro* Jashk and Chahbar back to tndia for the suimuer, and so reduce expenses. If. as T hope, things should settle dow&gt; quietly during the summer and the futility of attempting to renew the trade is revised, then a further reduction may be possible next autumn. ’'hatever is done, the effective stoppage of all sea transport of arms mast be the first consideration.

He would he glad to learn at an early date the names of the gentlemen selected to represent your department. I am, Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servant,. Arms Traffic at Muskat. 1. Sultan s Commercial Treaties. Ihe situation at Muskat is governed. * ^ r , , by the fact that the Sultan has com- 1839 . mercial treaties with the United States (1833). France (1844), and Great Britain (1891F), the terms of which require amendment before he can place special restrictions on the trade in arms to and from his territory. There is also a Dutch “ Commercial Declaration ” of 1877, which merely provides for reciprocal “ most-favoured-nation ” treatment between the two countries. The American, French, and British treaties \see Appendices] provide expressly for the unrestricted import and export of all kinds of merchandise (with certain specified exceptions). The Sultan’s international position is further regulated by the joint Anglo-French Declaration of 1862 by which the two Govern ments undertook reciprocally to respect Ills Highness’s independence, which it should also be our object to get rid of. 2. Prohibition of Arms Traffic in Persian Gulf. —Elsewhere on the Persian Gulf littoral a general prohibition of the arms traffic is in force. The import of arms into Persia was prohibited by a Decree of 1881 (re-affirmed by a law of 1900). In 1897 the Persian Government authorised British ships to seize and confiscate arms destined for Persian ports. Agreements pro hibiting the trade in their respective territories, and conferring powers of search, &amp;c., on British ships, were concluded with Bahrein (1898), Koweit (1900), and the Trucial Chiefs (1902). The import of arms into Turkey is also prohibited. In 1898 the Sultan of Muskat agreed to prohibit the export of arms from Muskat to India and Persia (where the import of arms was illegal), and empowered British ships-to act on h?s behalf in enforcing this prohibition. But (1) the import of arms into Muskat, and (2) their export except to the two specified countries, remain unprohibited. 3 Stats of the Traffic at Muskat.— The result has been to make Mu'skat the principal emporium of arms for the whole Middle East, rifles and ammunition being imported thither from Europe in large quantities, and thence dis tricted throughout the Gulf littoral. The bulk of these arms are smuggled “front Muskat to the coast of Persian Mekran, - up country by Afghan caravans and ultimately reach the tribesme Afghanistan and the North-Western Frontier of India the traffic in Persian territory. The following tables illustrate the extent of the import trade at Muskat I .—Rifles imported into Muskat. 1906-07. 1907-08. 1908-09.

Effect on the Indian Frontier. —The wholesale arming of tribesmen with modern weapons (to which the Muskat trade has led) has produced grave results on the ^North-West Frontier of India, where, in the opinion of the Government of India, a situation has arisen “ which has upset the “ balance of power, and constitutes a serious menace to the maintenance of “ peace.” Upwards of a quarter of a million sterling has been spent in pre ventive measures, which, while reducing the extent of the traffic, as shown by the figures given above, have proved that, until it is checked at the source, i.e., Muskat, the evil cannot be coped with effectively except at a prohibitive cost. 5. Negotiations with France.— His Majesty’s Government have more than once attempted, by diplomatic means, to obtain a “free hand ” at Muskat for the suppression of the arms traffic. At the Brussels Arms Conference of 1908-09 both the Dutch and American delegates expressed their readiness to forego their treaty rights in this respect, provided the other treaty powers did the same. But negotiations between Great Britain and France, with the object of obtaining a similar concession from the latter, broke down, and the Conference separated on the 31st December 1909 without any settlement being reached in regard to Muskat. Proposals for a temporary prohibition of the import of arms into Muskat, pending the permanent settlement of the question, were made to the French Government in April 1910, but, so far, they have been without result. 6. French share of Traffic.— It may be observed that France’s share in the import trade in arms and ammunition has been inconsiderable; but the distributing trade at Muskat itself is, or was, largely in the hands of local French dealers. The most important of these dealers, M. Goguyer, who died in October 1909, was understood to have powerful interests at his back, which made it difficult for the French Government to interfere with him. The effect of the naval blockade, which has been in operation since January 1910, has been that within the last few months the other firms have closed their doors, and that of Goguyer alone survives. 7. Question of Territorial Concessions in India. —As regards the quid pro quo to be offered by His Majesty’s Government in return for the renunciation by France of her rights under the Treaty of 1844 and the Declaration of 1862, the Government of India are prepared to cede to France territory in the neighbourhood of Pondicherry covering an area of 138 square miles, with a population of 195,000, yielding an annual revenue of about 2f lakhs (18,333h), on condition that the other French settlements in India (including Chander- nagore), which cover about 88 square miles, and have a population of 99,000, are ceded to Great Britain. They deprecate, however, the cession to France of any territory in India except as part of an exchange which would include the surrender to Great Britain of Chandernagore (a dangerous centre of sedition) and the scattered loges (m which the brench have no territorial rights, and the value of which, at 20 years’ purchase, has been put at Rs. 85,000^= 5,660h). It should be added that the question of an exchange of territory in India between Great Britain and France was raised in 1857, the proposal being then made that France should cede all her Indian possessions, excepto O Pondicherry and Karikal in i-ptm-n , Pondicherry. Negotiations on this snbject'nfter 1 ' rench f rritor y round seem to have died a natural death. The area w r,;„r^f ng 011 for some y ears &gt; cannot now be identified. ' ' uas P ro P°sed to cede might he taken of Urn de re ^ '' ith F™ce advantage to entertain, for a modification of tt present eriht, nt ai ' e UnderSt0 ° d under winch the authorities of the French Settlements‘in Indha™ bouinto f 6 ^s;;^ Articie 9 ° f ^ 1 Ins question has not been formally raised by the French Government but a pledge was given by M. Pichon in the French Senate on 8th July 1909 that he would approach the British Government in the matter. 9. Pondicherry-Cuddalore (Tiruppappuliyur) Railway.—The French have for some years been anxious to build a railway connecting these two places but the Madras Government have objected to their proposals, which involved construction and working under French regulations of a line which must travel seLntisli teiritoiy (though only for mile) and be connected with the British Indian railway system. It is possible that there is material for a deal here. 10. Question of Compensation. —As has already been pointed out, the French manufacturing interest in the Muskat trade is not large. As regards the question of paying compensation for losses consequent upon the prohibition of the traffic, the Government of India recently (30th January 1911) expressed the view that “provided arrangements are “ made under which. Sultan can prohibit imports, it would be cheaper to buy “ up all stocks of arms at the market price than to maintain blockade which “ would be necessary if the export of existing stocks is to he prevented. “ This is the only form of direct compensation which should be entertained. “ If we begin discussing compensation to traders or manufacturers or loss of “ prospective profits we should be embarking on a very large question in “ connection with which Muskat and British dealers, and even German and “ Belgian manufacturers, might clamour for equal treatment. We should “ adopt argument that although shipment has been legal destination of arms “ has been notoriously illicit, and that both dealers and manufacturers who “ have already made such heavy profits are deserving of no sympathy. As “ regards agreement which Sultan is believed to have entered into with “ certain of the dealers authorising them to import arms for a specified term “ of years, I think we could refuse to recognise them and leave persons “ concerned to get what redress they can from the Sultan.” The firm of Goguyer, as has been said above, is the only French firm now left at Mnskat. But, as was stated in Sir R. Ritchie's letter to the Foreign Office, dated the 3rd February 1911, recent customs returns show that there has been a marked increase in shipments of arms to Muskat; and it is to be feared that, if negotiations are protracted, and especially if the idea gets abroad that His Majesty’s Government are likely to pay direct compensation, the market will be Hooded with arms, &amp;e., which we may find ourselves obliged to purchase. It was therefore suggested that the date on which negotiations with France are resinned should be fixed as the latest limit of time beyond which His Majesty s Government will not iccognise any imports into Muskat in any assessment of compensation that may be necessary.

From Viceroy, mil January 1911 . at total prohibition ol import and export, and nothing short of this will be of real advantage. State monopoly would be quite impracticable. It would probably be farmed to the highest bidder who might possibly be an arms dealer. Control of Customs by Government of India would not affect arms traffic question until the prohibition of imports has been arranged, after which some proper control over Customs might be necessary to render such prohibition effective, but Sultan would probably not accept Government control over Customs except under compulsion. With regard to question of compensation, provided arrangements are made under which Sultan can prohibit imports, it would be cheaper to buy up all stocks of arms at the market price than to maintain blockade which would be necessary if the export of existing stocks is to be prevented. This is the only form of direct compensation which should be entertained. If we begin discussing com pensation to traders or manufacturers or loss of prospective profits we should be embarking on a very large question in connection with which Maskat and British dealers, and even German and Belgian manufacturers, might clamour for equal treatment. We should adopt argument that although shipment has been legal destination of arms has been notoriously illicit, and that both dealers and manufacturers who have already made such heavy profits are deserving of no sympathy. As regards agreement which Sultan is believed to have entered into with certain of the dealers authorising them to import arms for a specified term of years, I think we could refuse to recognise them and leave persons concerned to get what redress they can from the Sultan. If an agreement with France should be found possible it must not be forgotten to come to terms with other Powers who have commercial treaties with Maskat.SlCTIQN 2. No. 1. Sir Edward Grey to Sir F.

Gambon to-day that I heard he had spoken to Sir Arthur Nicolson about Muscat, and had suggested that it might be possible to make some arrangement of a local character, less extensive than the settlement previously proposed. I should be very glad to receive suggestions in this sense, for as he would have seen there was a great deal of feeling here with regard to the Gambia, and—though an agreement with regard to it might not be impossible—it could not be effected without a great deal of fuss and very large compensation. I noticed that there was also an agitation in Trance against the cession of any French-Indian territory. M. Cambon was quite alive to this. M.

Prom the Government of India’s point of view the position described could hardly be more satisfactory. We have the foreign armsdealers in a state of scuttle and the Sultan in extremis from a financial point of view. Unfortunately in Foreign Department telegramf No. S.—698, dated 17th . 0 . . „ OQ November, I was informed that “ there is no immediate prospect of negotiations with the French.” A recent suggestion in Reuters to the effect that the cession of Chander- nasrore was under negotiation, coupled with the lively endeavours of the French armsdealers in Maskat to sell their stocks of arms and leave Oman, had led me to hope t lat some negotiations were actually on foot, anh it was consequently •with the more acute disappointment that 1 have .received the intimation above quoted. I beg, with the highest respect, to remind the Government of India that the whole basis of tite recommendations of their representatives, in the direc tion of the inception and the maintenance of this expensive blockade for two full seasons, has been that His Majesty’s Foreign Office would, in that period, be able to negotiate a settlement with France ; and that the effect of the blockade would be to reduce the Sultan and the French element to a frame of mind conducive to the acceptance of reasonable terms. The blockade lias in every way achieved the results anticipated, as the present correspondence shows clearly enough, but so far as l am aware it will not be kept up after the close of this winter season, and failing a settlement with the French in that time, we can only apprehend that the trafhc will speedily, or at the best gradually, revive. I venture to urge very earnestly that the seriousness of this prospect be not lost sight of. No. 1512, dated Maskat* the 19tk November 1910 (Confidential). F rom Major A. P. Trevor, Political Agent and His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Maskat, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to submit the following report regarding the present position of affairs at Maskat in connection with the arms traffie. 2. Mens. Lagasse, the Agent of Messrs.

In trying to obtain the value of ^ goods brought by the Hamburg Amerika steamers I have found that the Customs - books have not been made up since April, and the Superintendent accounts for this by the fact that the Department is so heavily in debt to merchants, that they are quite at sea with their accounts. It is difficult to say to what total the indebtedness of the Customs Department rises, but report says from 60,031) to 80,000 rupees. There is no doubt in any case that the debt is large, and that the Sultan’s finances are in an exceptionally had condition. The result of this state of affairs is that it is increasingly difficult to get cases settled, and matters are rapidly reaching a dead-lock. It is thus most desirable from a local point of view to come to some arrangement with Trance as soon as possible, so that the present awkward position may be terminated. _Since writing the above I hear that Messrs. Kevorkoff’s agent sold off the firms’ stock of arms by auction yesterday at a very low average figure, about 15 or 16 rupees. The stock has been bought by native and 1 ersian dealers. The result of this, and of the facts reported at the beginning of this letter, will he that by the end of the year Messrs. Goguyer will be the only foreign firm of arms merchants in Maskat. While on the subject of Me^rs Goguyer, I may mention that the Trench Consul informed me in con versation that the firm’s dhow “ Tath-el-Khair ” is ialling to pieces, and that he has agreed to their proposal to substitute another dhow under the same name.

The only conjecture we can put upon this correspondence is that you have not properly gauged the situation; and we assure you and your principals that we are no more capable of engaging into illegal traffic than you or they are. If you have not understood the position correctly it is no fault of ours, hut you will admit that our subsequent suggestions were merely made to correspond with the port-marking, and if you had X sent us a copy of the Hamburg letter dated 5th at the proper time, we should not have made the subsequent t suggestions we made, as you can see that if goods port- marked 'Hamburg' are landed at D*Jibouti then some other action should be taken with it to make it correspond, otherwise by leaving the matter in the form as Messrs Moxon, Salt and Company 101, Leadenhall Street E.C.as suggested t&gt;y you might cause complications, and it hecomes necessary for us to draw your attention first to our letter of the 12th July wherein we, ourselves, knowing these difficulties had suggested that the goods in the ordinary way, on the return journey should he brought to the Continent and then taken hack again like ordinary shipments and landed at D'Jihouti. Secondly, we reiterated this opinion of ours again in ours of the 18th July, hut against this is suited the purpose of your principals, and they, themselves, suggested that the packages should he marked ’’Hamburg' and yet delivered at D'Jihouti, and when this matter did not look to us quite regular, have we done anything wrong in showing you the proper way to do it, and instead of looking at this matter in a proper business way you now write in a way as if we are asking you to do something that is not right. These laboured suggestions of ours, according to our thinking, should follow goods marked 'Hamburg ,, and then delivered at Djibouti. Is not that so? Unfortunately, we have completed our arrangements with our friends otherwise we should not have troubled you further in the matter.To cut the matter s^iort^ we think the best course would toe to trlng the goods tack again to Hamburg and then deliver ty the same boat (or any other boat that may be going out again) to D'Jlbouti In the ordinary course, and it would save all the trouble. But against this you stated that owing to the regulations at Hamburg if the cartridges are taken out and put on board another boat there may be unnecessary charges. You will remember that we have sent down some cartridges to Hamburg for the Steamship 'Sparta' which must have waited there for at least a week before you were able to take them on board and this experiment would give you some idea as to whether our suggestion could be carried out. If these charges do not amount to much we are prepared to pay them but If these charges are heavy then we suggest we will Instruct our Agent at '.'useat • ■ ‘ to ship only the rifles port-marked and delivered at Hamburg, and replace a corresponding lot of cartridges from this side, but then it is understood for the cartridges that we may deliver from here you will not makemake us any extra charge for same. This thing should put all parties right and we again repeat this has been our suggestion from the beginning, hut whatever happened subsequently has only been brought about through your principal's suggestion about landing the goods at Djibouti straightway, and marked 'HamburgV We are hoping you will write your principals in time that they may amend the instructions to the Captain and ask him to bring the goods to Hamburg and not land them at D'Jihouti as arranged previously.

Upon further consideration we think that if the cases are larded at D'Jihouti with the Port mark 'Hamburg' it might make the French Authorities there unnecessarily curious; so we suggest that after the goods have been' shipped at uscat, during the voyage the word 'Hamburg' should be planed off and the word 'D'Jibouti' substi tuted, and any extra expense incurred to be paid by us. Our Agent will furnish the Captain with a list of the goods shipped and therefrom the Captain on the voyage can make out the Bs/Lading himself with the D'Jibouti port mark, and hand same over to our Agent at D'Jibouti whose name we have already given you.

But it is beyond our dignity to meddle with the arm smuggling, and we therefore refuse to make out the Bill of Lading aboard, or to replace the word 'Hamburg' on the cases by the word 'Djibouti'. Under such conditions we should prefer not to take the 10 tons from Muscat to Djibouti at all.

The Bills of Lading can he made out by essrs Towells in the usual way, and we will instruct our Agent to hand over one copy to the Captain, for delivery to our Agent at D'Jibouti, viz: Messrs.

We suggest this, because we know in a small place like Muscat anything that is being done in one's office is known to others almost imnediately. Reading between the lines of what your principals say it would look as if they are under the impression that there may be something behind what we are asking them to do, but please assure them that there is no such intention, and the only reason why we are doing this is to prevent their interference with our future shipments, as it is our intention gradually to send to D'Jibouti all our stocks at Muscat as at the latter portport now the goods are well nigh unsaleable.

From— His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief, H. M. S. “ Hyacinth ” at AuGD, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Marine Department. With reference to my letter No. 1462-XIY of the 4th instant, forwarding a copy of the sailing orders to the Commanding Officer, H. M. S. “ Fox ” to proceed to the Persian Gulf Division for duty in connection with the suppression of the traffic in arms, be pleased to acquaint His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General of India in Council that an extra cutter and Maxim gun have been supplied to that ship, to enable her, whilst employed on that service, to keep at least 5 of her boats constantly away cruising. It is hoped that the “ Fox will be joined by the “ Philomel ” about the beginning of November, which wiU further increase the number of boats available. 2. It, therefore, becomes necessary to consider the question of the disposal of any dhows engaged in the arms traffic that may be captured. 3. As far as I can ascertain, the craft engaged in the trade are usually Maskat owned. Since our principal objective must be to render the traffic so unremunerative that it will cease to attract capital, it follows that one of the most important points is to render it so risky that the dhow-owners, for their own protection, will have to raise the freight against the shippers of arms. y 4. If Maskat dhows, on being captured, were taken back to Maskat, as was proposed by a former Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, it is probable that they would be sold by auction by the Sultan, and bought in at a nominal sum by their late owners, who would then use them again in the same trade. Comparatively speaking, the loss to the dhow-owners would be small, and would practically take the form of a fine to be paid to the Sultan, if the dhow were caught. The sum would be easily recovered from the shippers by a small general rise of freight. 5. On the other hand, if the dhows were sent to a British Port of Adjudi cation, and there condemned by a Prize Court to be destroyed, it is probable that the effect on the traffic in arms would be considerable. The actual loss to the original owner of the dhow would cause a substantial rise in freight, as there would be a great difference between the total loss and the payment of a fine or ransom to the Sultan for the recovery of the vessel. This difference must be covered somehow if the dhow-owner is to make a profit. In course of time, a shortage would probably occur among the dhows suitable for the trade, which would mean a further rise in freight. 6 . It is, therefore, suggested, for the consideration of the Government of India,* that a Colonial Court of Admiralty should be established at Karachi, which should be also a Prize Court under the provisions of the Naval Prize Act, 1864, and the Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act, 1890, in order that any dhows captured while engaged in the arms traffic, may be sent there for adjudication.

With reference to my letter No. 1462-XIV.K of the Hth ultimo, leeeetine that a Colonial Court of Admiralty should he established at Karachi ir dealing with dhows seized while engaged in the arms traffic, be pleased to v before His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General of India m ouncil the annexed copy of a memorandum issued to the ships under my rders enclosing a statement showing the powers possessed by His Majesty s iips for exercising the right of search and detention of vessels so engaged. 2 It will be seen that I have given orders that, for the present, Maskat, ld Persian dhows seized upon the High Seas, and Persian dhows taken in9° Persian waters, are to be detained pending instructions. The whole of the condi * tions governing this trade are now so different to what they were five years ago when the original orders were issued, and the suppression of the arms traffic appears to me to he of such supreme importance to the Indian Empire, that it is most necessary to prevent the arms, and the dhows carrying them, when captured, from finding their way back to Maskat. I would urge that, if the Sultan’s consent is required before Maskat dhows taken outside the territorial waters of Oman can he brought to Karachi for adjudication, his consent should he obtained forthwith. CONFIDENTIAL GENERAL MEMORANDA. “ Hyacinth ” at Mukalla, 28th October 1909. No. 48. Bights of visit, search and detention. The following instructions on the rights of visit, search and detention of vessels by His Majesty’s ships are communicated for information and guidance, 2. * Under the General Act of the Brussels Conference, 1890, His Majesty’s ships are invested with the powers of visit, search and detention over vessels suspected of being engaged in, or equipped for, the slave trade, under certain conditions which are laid down in the “ Instructions to Naval Officers employed in the Suppression of Slave Trade (Pages 2 to 13.) 3 . Articles VIII to XIII of the General Act prohibit the importation of firearms and ammunition into the territories therein specified, but the Brussels Act does not of itself confer any powers of search or detention for the enforce ment of the articles quoted. 4 . Such rights as His Majesty’s ships possess to search and detain vessels suspected of being engaged in the arms traffic are derived from local regulations, when the vessels are in British territorial waters, and from agreements made with certain foreign States when the vessels are in their respective territorial waters. His Majesty’s ships have not authority to search upon the High Seas vessels suspected of being engaged in the arms traffic, in the absence of treaties with other Powers, and in the case of British vessels, of an Act of the Imperial Parliament. 5. The rights of His Majesty’s ships in this connection are summarised in the annexed statement. E. J. W.

When a dhow flying French colours is sighted, she is to be followed, and if she should land arms or ammunition in Persian territory, the arms and ammunition are, if possible, to be seized on shore forthwith. 3 . Armed launches and boats are to endeavour to communicate with a ship immediately upon sighting a dhow under the French flag, in order that she may be kept in view, and that the necessary force may be at hand to pre vent the arms from passing into the hands of the Afghans. 4 . A copy of these orders is to be placed in each boat and armed launch sent away cruising. Edmond J. W. Slade, Rear-Admiral. The Captains, Commanders, and Officers Commanding His Majesty’s ships, employed on the East Indies Station* and all others concerned.[Enclosure to East Indies Confidential General Memorandum No. 56.] Extract from the “Instructions for the Guidance of Officers employed in the Suppression of the Slave Trade,” 1892. Directions as to vessels under the French flag. You will continue to be guided in your conduct towards vessels under the French flag by the Instructions of 1867 with regard to visiting merchant vessels suspected of fraudulently assuming it. They are as follows i— 1. In virtue of the independence of National Flags, a merchant vessel navigating the High Seas is not subject to any foreign jurisdiction which shall not have been accepted by Treaty. A ship of war can, therefore, visit, detain, arrest or seize only such merchant Vessels as are recognised to belong to her own nation. 2. The colours of a vessel being primd facie the distinctive mark of her nationality, and consequently of the jurisdiction to which she is subject, it is natural that a merchant vessel on the High Seas, passing within view of a ship of war should hoist her flag in declaration of her nationality. So soon, therefore, as the ship of war has made herself known by the display of her own colours, the merchant vessel should also hoist her national flag. 3 . Should the merchant vessel neglect to do so, it is admitted by the two Governments that a warning may be given to her ; first, by firing a blank gun, and should that be without effect, it may be enforced by a second gun, shotted, but pointed in such a manner as to ensure that she is not struck by the shot. 4 . Immediately that the merchant vessel has, by hoisting her colours, announced her nationality, the foreign ship of war can no longer pretend to exercise the least control over her. At most, in certain cases, she may exercise the right to speak with her, and demand answers to questions addressed to her through a speaking trumpet, or otherwise, but without obliging her to alter or impede her course. When, however, the presumption of nationality resulting from the colours which may have been shown by a merchant vessel may be seriously thrown in doubt, either from positive information or from indications of a nature to creat a belief that the vessel does not belong to the nation whose colours she has assumed, the foreign ship of war may have recourse to the verification of her assumed nationality. 5 . A boat may for this purpose be sent to the suspected vessel, after she has been first hailed to give notice of the intention. The venficataon s a consist in an examination of the papers estabhshing the nationality of the vess . Kothing can be claimed beyond the exhibition of those documents. The paper* to be produced by the merchant vessels shall be for English vesse s, the “Certificate Registry” and “Ship’s Articles,” and for Erencb vessels the “Actede Francisation” and the “Conge”. _ The officer verification should always be a comnnssioned offiwr, if ttere ly uch an ^ffic on board, and should be in uniform. He should proceed with all possible courtesy and consideration. 6 . Any enquiry into the nature of the cargo or the commerci P of the vessel, or, in short, mto any other fact besiaes mai m _ is prohibited. Any search or inspection whatever is absolu y 7. Before the officer of the cruiser quits the ^-l^written statement (proces verbal) shall be prepared by t e circumstances attending of the merchant vessel, wherein shall be stated all me ci ^ , s to keep the vertification. It shall be signed by bo p &gt; . t t a copy thereof. If there should be any difference of 0P“ 10 “ “ 1 to I the officer of the cruiser and the master of the merchant vessel P pare a statement and frunish each other wi a . ,1 never be 8. Except in the case of legitimate suspicion or fraud, it sho Id a necessary for the commander of a foreign ship of war94 - ^ , , ttqcdo1 Qn numerous are the indications which, apart from the “lofrSre sufficient to show to the practised eye of a seaman the nationality ° f a rt every case it is clearly to be understood that the captain of a ship , J, Zdetermines to hoard a merchant vessel must do so at his own risk and perilfand must remain responsible for all the consequences which may result from his own act. , ,, . 10 The commander of a ship of war who may have recourse to that measure should in all cases r^rt the fact ^“‘su^ “ £ t a ? ‘the ^“nVwh^ may^ave Tcd to the verification, shall he gLn officially to the Government tlwhich the vessel may belong which shall have been subjected to such verification of her flag. 11 If after examination of her pepers, a merchant vessel suspected of fraud shall be detained by a foreign cruiser, she must, as soon as possible, be taken into a port, or to an authority of the nationality claimed m order that the ri'bt to her flag may be verified by the authorities of the nation to w ic t fla“ belongs. If the claim is recognised to he fraudulent, the vessel will, of course 3 remafn at the disposal of the captor. In the con rary case, a claim may be made for indemnification as under the circumstances defined in 12 In all cases in which the verification of the flag shall not be justified by sufficient reasons, or shall not have been made in a proper manner, a claim may be made for indemnification. 13 You will clearly understand that the foregoing instructions have reference only to vessels navigating under the French flag, and are intended to iM-event misunderstanding between the British and French Governments bu cannot affect the vessels of other nations with whom Great Britain has Treaties for the suppression of the Slave Trade or deprive Her Majesty of the right to seize and detain vessels engaged in the Slave Trade, when not entitled to the protection of any national flag. No. 4.1-1462—XIV-K., dated the 4th March 1910. From—His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief, Bombay, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Marine Department. With reference to Marine Department telegram No. 409 M. of 25th February 1910, and my telegram No. 43 of the 27th idem, relative to the proposed establishment of a Colonial Court of Admiralty and Prize Court at Karachi, be pleased to acquaint His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General ot India in Council that, if the operations of His Majesty’s ships for the suppression of the arms traffic are confined to the Persian coast and the blockade treated as merely a preventive service for Persia against the importation of arms, fh® 11 the Court suggested will not be necessary. On the other hand, if we blockade the Persian coast on our own account against all vessels carrying arms, whether with or without a preliminary agreement with Foreign Powers, I am of opinion that we shall then be obliged to set up a Prize Court to adjudicate on all prizes taken. 2. So long as only dhows which are without papers and which do not belong to a State which has ideas on International Law are in question, the advantages to he derived from a Prize Court will not be marked. When we become ^involved with other States, however, it will probably he necessary to proceed by legal process, in order that we may claim that we are not acting capriciously and without due investigation 3. In the operations for the suppression of the Slave Trade, which were omewhat analogous to those at present in progress, it was found necessary to sreate Prize Courts having special Slave Trade jurisdiction. It will depend cpon the character given ultimately to the blockade as to whether this step will become necessary or not in the present case.. oi t&lt;^ (^0- ^ (g) ^ From Secretary of State to Viceroy, Foreign Department, 18th April 1910.

We agree generally in the views expressed in the letter from the Government of Bengal, dated the 10th October 1908, regarding the case of Charu Chandra Boy, and we take the opportunity of forwarding, for your information, a copy of a letter from that Government, No. 301 3)., dated the 23rd—24th April 1909, and to refer to the letter* No. 60, dated the 21st October 1861, to the Governor of the Prench Settle ments in India, which is quoted therein. It was clearly contemplated when the letter of the 21st October 1861 was written that extradition might be demanded and would be granted in the case of treason against the sovereign. Por treason was expressly included among the heinous offences in respect of which extradition might be demanded by Section 21 of Act VII of 1854 which is referred to in the letter just alluded to and which was in force when that letter was written. Should it prove impossible to arrive at a satisfactory settlement with the Prench Government on the lines indicated in the preced ing paragraph, we would urge strongly that, for the reasons given by the Government of Bengal, the term “ petty local offences” should not be held to include offences punishable under the Arms Act, or under the Explosive Substances. Act, and that an attempt should be made to secure that as limited a construction as possible will be placed on the words “ political offences”. We have already alluded to the fact that in 1861 treason was regarded definitely as an offence for which extradition was to be granted, and we consider it of the greatest importance, in view of the conditions* now prevailing in India, to secure, if possible, an interpretation of Treaty obligations which will not place obstacles in the way of maintaining peace and order in British India. We suggest that a hint might be given to the Prench Government that, if no satisfactory settlement can be arrived at, it may be necessary, as has been suggested by the Government of Bengal, to surround Chandernagore with a cordon of police and customs post.List of Enclosures in Secret despatch No. 107 (General), dated the 4th August 1910, from the Government of India in the Foreign Department, to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India.^7 Z^ '2&gt; / No. D.—301-D., dated Darjeeling, the 23rd—24th April 1909 (Very Secret). From—F. W. Duke, Esq., Officiating Chief Secretary to the Government of Bengal, To— The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your telegram No. S. 166 dated the 15th instant, in which you intimate that the French Government have unofficially hinted their willingness to make concessions as to Chander- magore and the loges in return for concessions elsewhere, but without — the -- — — — ciociwiJGics, uut WILIIOUL specifying how far they are prepared to go. You request the opinion of the Lieutenant-Governor as to the value to India of concessions in respect of Dhandernagore and the loges in Bengal and ask what concessions His Honour could suggest as being really valuable. 2 . I am to reply that Sir Edward Baker shares the opinion entertained by Sir Andrew Fraser that the French possessions in Bengal are a source of greater trouble, actual and potential, to the British authorities than they can be of profit or satisfaction to the Government of France. The inconvenience arising from Chandernagore being a French possession has long been felt in several different ways. The French rights interfere with the control of the river both in respect of proposals for bridges below Chandernagore and of the policing of the river in its neighbourhood. The extradition of bad characters has always given trouble. This subject has acquired increasing prominence of late years and the simplicity of the system by which in earlier days the French authorities readily surrendered criminals of all kinds on demand, has been gradually modified, so that it is now hardly easier to procure extradition from Chandernagore than from foreign countries under modern extradition treaties. Chandernagore has long been a depot for opium-smugglers, and in spite of the considerable sums which we have been paying to the French authorities to limit the opium traffic it is probable that illicit transactions continue to take place. Lately, there has been reason to believe that arms and ammunition are being smuggled into Bengal through Chandernagore. Evidence has also been obtained that there exists a traffic in arms procured from British territory, which had been parted with by their lawful owners or which were supposed to have been destroyed by the police. In some instances these have been found to have returned to British territory in unlawful possession. There is no provision corresponding to the Arms Act in force in the territory, and the French authorities are therefore powerless to exert any control over the possession of arms. An attempt was made by them to obtain control by a local ordinance passed by the Governor of the French Indian Possesssions in 1907, but this was not ratified from Paris and lapsed and so far has not been replaced by other legislation. There is also reason to believe that the secret societies which have given so much trouble in British territory also exist in Chandernagore which forms a safe and easy rallying ground for their members within a dangerously short distance of Calcutta. The small size of the territory renders it impossible for the French Government to maintain an adminis tration sufficiently powerful to cope with the varying forms of illegal activity even if considerations connected with politics in the mother country allowed them a free hand, which there is some reason to believe they do not. 3 The difficulties connected with the loges are less important, although trouble has arisen on more than one occasion, principally because while they are excluded from British jurisdiction there is no effective French police ,or magisterial administration on the spot. 4 The onlv arrangement which will entirely remove these difficulties is the cession of Chandernagore and its dependencies to the British Crown. The advantage in administrative convenience to both countries would be ver y au h . b worth a considerable expenditure. e t:. 1 i ''•r vir? being situated in the midst of British districts have long been felt is shown by the history of the negotiations which have at different period beenJ exchange tnd wou^ZTle^n eeM to Great ” ^ 6 That* treaty was ^never executed and the question remained in Britain.

Perhaps the most important of these would be the restor ation of the old extradition procedure under the treaty of 1815. According to this Europeans and others against whom judicial proceedings had been instituted for offences committed or debts contracted were to be delivered up. The re a- xor oneuceb l tions between the Indian possessions of ’ Great Britain and France are governed* by Article IX of the Treaty of 1815. The interpretation which the Govern^ rnent of India placed on that treaty is contained in the letter No. bU ot the 21st October 1861 addressed to the Government of the French Settle ments in India; it was that by tacit consent of both contracting powers- the clause relating to the extradition of debtors was not acted upon, and that the “ offences ” were limited to offences of a grave character and excluded mere petty local offences or political offences* This right to ex tradite political offenders appears to have been gratuitously surrendered. The Extradition Treaty of 1876 between France and England expressly ex cluded in its Article XVI the “ arrangements established in the East Indian possessions of both countries by the 9th Article of the Treaty of the 7th March 1815”. Notwithstanding this, in 1898, the Administrateur des Colonies, Chandernagore, was unwiUing to accede to the application for extradition in a case of adultery and enticing away a married woman under sections 497 and 498 of the Indian Penal Code, on the ground that the Treaty of 1815 was expressed in vague terms, and that it was necessary to refer to the general principle of international right, and urged that the offences named were not included in the Treaty of 1 76. The Government of Bengal has, however, m all subsequent requests continued to base its demands on the Treaty oi i - The Government of India again reviewed the international rights and declared in letter No. 1934-1., of the 29th May 1884, to the address of this Government, that the procedure “ under which persons accused of non-political offences nf « crrnvp character have hitherto been surrendered on application supportedby a warrant and summary of charges, no deposition of witnesses being required ”, was maintained, and it was declared that neither the Indian Extra dition Act XXI of 1879, nor the English Act of XXXIII and XXXIV Vic., Cap. 52, applied. Lately, in September 1908, the French authorities have again referred to the Treaty of 1876 and have demanded in a case under sections 463, 467 and 471 of the Indian Penal Code that the warrant itself should contain the summary of the charges. This has been conceded, as it was prescribed in a Circular of this Government of 1879, though it had been permitted to fall into desuetude in recent years, as a concise statement of the charge which was furnished along with the warrant, was considered sufficient. The reference to the Treaty of 1876 was disregarded, and the amended warrant issued under Article 9 of the Treaty of the 7th March 1815. The demand for the applica tion of the treaty of 1876 has to be resisted, and it may be repeated at any time. The statement of the Foreign Department letter of 1861 above referred to, that petty local offences which would not necessarily be treated as criminal acts by the laws of both countries should he excluded was considered to bar the prosecution of Charu Chandra Ray under the Explosives Act or Arms Act, because there are no corresponding laws in the French territory. As offences of really serious importance may be committed under these acts, it seems that the interpretation of “ local offences ” has been carried to a dangerous extent. 8 . It is difficult to suggest the exact form of the arrangement which should be made, but the essential point is that the French authorities should be willing to execute process for the arrest of persons accused of any act declared to be an offence by the law of British India. It is assumed that there would be no difficulty in assenting to a reciprocal engagement on the part of British India to the surrender of persons alleged to have committed offences under the French law in Chandernagore. However contrary to the principles of international law it may be to surrender for an offence, without enquiry as to whether it would be an offence in the surrendering country, yet it can surely be shown to be not unreasonable where an insignificant portion of the territory of a friendly Power is enclosed in the midst of a great empire. 9. Very great relief would also be afforded to the administration of the neighbouring districts if the French would adopt and strictly enforce laws restricting the possession of arms and explosives similar to those in force m our own territories. The fact that they have had such steps under contemplation has been referred to in the second paragraph of this letter, and it is probable that they might not have much objection to carry out such legislation it it were strongly pressed for. 10. Finally in the matter of excise it would be a considerable advant age if we could obtain the right to control the retail sale of indigenous exc - able liouor and dru-s in Chandemagore. Under the Convention of 1815 the o. .r»g‘thV”' is. z C X aCtta° P1U In 1884 they surrendered tMs right in consideration of an annual Calcutta. in las ’ l '7 Snhseouentlv in 1889 a fresh Convention was entered made to them.

A liberal money payment in respect of the IvmC concession might induce a conciliatory attitude in respect of the other = Attention may fairly he directed to the fact that Chandernagore has been hitherto treated with extreme friendliness In view of its situation in the heart of our territory and near our capital of the conditions prevailing in resnect of arms and excise and of the political situation, we might reasonably have imposed police and customs restrictions which could be defended as necessary in our interests, but could not hut have been galling to the Inhabitants of a small settlement, numbers of whom are compelled by their avocations to cross the frontier every day. Instead of taking such action we have throughout relied on the friendly disposition of the French authorities and on their capacity to avoid friction or serious injury to our interests and we are entitled to the friendliest consideration in return. 12 While offering for the consideration of the Government of India these suggestions on minor points, Sir Edward Baker would desire it to be understood that he deems them of small account compared with the mam ohiect of obtaining the control of the territory by exchange, purchase, or lease. This he thinks of such real importance in view of the change m the poutica; situation in Bengal as to be worth great effort and some sacrifice.

Mayer, K.C.I.E., Chief Secretary to the Govern ment of Madras, To The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I am directed to confirm my telegram No. 80 of the 23rd instant in reply to Foreign Department’s telegram No. 355 (J.E.D.) G., dated the 15th instant, on the subieet of a change proposed by the French Government m the proce dure of extradition of criminals in India, and to explain more fully the news of the Madras Government. 2. The Government of India state that the French Government will probably ask shortly for the modification of Article IX of the Convention of the 7th March 1815 between Great Britain and France regarding their posses sions in India, with the object of substituting for the special Procedure there provided the procedure prescribed in the general treaty of * 1876 , for the mutual extradition of the fugitive crimmak of the two powers, under which the French authorities will be empowered to refuse surrend r their own nationals. 3166 F. D.N 16 S. The present position, the Madras Government understand, is that, in the* view at least of His Majesty’s Government, article IX of the Conven tion of 1815 alone governs the case of extradition between British India and the French possessions in India. This was stated in the letter from the Government of India to this Government No. 4061-I.A., dated 3rd October 1905, referred to in yonr telegram, and the Government of India proceeded to observe at the close of the same letter that “ the procedure should continue to be governed entirely by article IX of the Treaty of 1815, the view of the French authorities in favour of the application of the later Treaty being rejected.” 4. This statement of the view of the French authorities is apparently based on paragraph 4, sub-paragraph (3), of this Government’s letter No. 1092- Judicial, dated 12th July 1905, where it was observed that the French Govern ment, in matters connected with extradition and the period of detention of fugitive offenders, referred as a rule to the provisions of the Treaty of 1876. Lest there should be any misapprehension, I am directed to explain that the Pondicherry Administration do not appear now to maintain that the Treaty of 1876 governs the case or is in any way binding on the British Government in India: they merely apply the procedure of the Treaty of 1876 analogously in practice, arguing that the Treaty of 1815 prescribes no procedure. In this connexion I am to quote the following extract (translation) from a letter addressed last June by the Administrator of Karikal to the District Magis trate, Tan j ore: “ I have the honour to inform you that the Governor of the French Establishments in India is unable to modify the procedure hitherto adopted in India in so far as it relates to intervals in the matter of extradition. The considerations which have led the Chief of our Colony to adopt this opinion are these : It is evident that extradition in India is regulated by a single Act, viz., the treaty of 1815. But this Treaty has only fixed the principle without settling the details and the procedure to be followed. To fill up these blanks two methods were possible, (1) to have recourse to another and com plementary treaty, or (2) to apply by tacit consent the methods promulgated in other Acts of legislature of the same nature, without at the same time violating the spirit and the letter of the Treaty of 1815. It is the second of these methods which has been preferred, and it has been thus during the last century that use has been made of the Convention of 1815 and afterwards of the Convention of 1876, which was not drawn up for India** It is thus clear from the passages in italics above that the Pondicherry Administration admit that the case is really governed by the Convention of 1815. That treaty does not empower the French authorities to refuse surrender of their own nationals, and accordingly to concede this power would be to make a substantial concession. 5. In that event similar power must of course be taken by the British Government, but the Governor in Council does not think that such a, change would be of real advantage to either Government. Having regard to the interlacing of the present frontiers, the existence of small French enclaves entirely surrounded by British territory and the intimate connection of the people in the small French areas with those of the neighbouring British villages, the new procedure proposed would make the prevention of crime more difficult, and thus be to the disadvantage of the French Government as well as ours. Under present conditions the police of both Governments usually work with perfect harmony, and the existence of a frontier may in general almost be said to be ignored, while the proposed method would seriously restrict this happy co-operation in the prevention of crime. J 6 . This special character of the French possessions in India was recognized in the Convention of 1815, which not only provides for the mutual sur?ender of suspected criminals, but prevents the French authorities from erecting fortifications m their territory, or keeping troops except for necessary police purposes, while their freedom of action in regard to salt and opium is also UDIItCCLcan, however, be no doubt ^ French elections and this squabble 17 7. The origin of the present proposal is probably to be traced to case, the papers* in which I * G. 0. No. 1352-Judicial, dated 6th October 1909. Letter No. 482-Political, dated 6th October 1909. a recent - ^ _ am to for- waid tor the Government of India’s information. Serious riots occurred in connection with the Trench general elec- . , 4 -n + j i i i tions in a locality where the frontiers interlace, so that the disturbance took place partly on British and partly on French territory. A demand by the French authorities for the rendition of British subjects who had been concerned in the looting of a house iust inside the French boundary was duly complied with ; but they were most unwilling to comply m their turn with a similar demand for the rendition of certain French subjects, and eventually the Madras Government, in view of the small importance of the case, and the probable difficulties in the way of a con viction, yielded to the representations of the French administration, withdrew their demand for extradition and cancelled the warrants. One of the French subjects concerned was a certain N andagopal Chetty, Deputy Mayor of Pondi cherry, and the solicitude of the French authorities appears to have been mainly on his behalf. The Government of Madras have little doubt that the present proposal is traceable to the influence of a political party at Pondicherry, and to the risk of extradition to which the Deputy Mayor was recently exposed by his complicity, or alleged complicity, in an election riot. 8. In these circumstances the Madras Government would prefer that the proposal should, if possible, be opposed. If, however, the French Government presses the demand, and it is considered advisable for political reasons to accede to it, the Madras Government do not consider that any strong opposi tion need be made. The French territories in India are, after all, of insigni ficant extent and the question is not one of great importance. They would however suggest tliat opportunity should be taken to press for the rectifica tion of the Pondicherry frontier, the cession of Yanaon and the sale of the French loges advocated in Mr. Atkinson’s recent letter No. 257, dated 1st June 1909 ; and especially for the first of these proposals. The rectification of the frontier would make a clearer dividing line between that settlement and British India, and thus go some way towards removing objections, in the interests of criminal justice, to the proposed new procedure. Confidential. GOVERNMENT OF MADRAS. JUDICIAL DEPARTMENT. No. 1352-Judicial, dated the 6th October 1909. Read— the following papers :— I No. Ref. on C.-2290-Magte., dated Cuddalore, the 18th October 1908. From— A. R. Knapp, Esq., I.C.S., Acting District Magistrate of South Arcot, To—The Chief Secretary to the Government of Madras. I have the honour to report, for the information of Government, the occur- tacts t a British and French subjects respectively, and that the18 the hostility was equally fierce on both sides, or whether as is suggested, one side were the aggressors and the other merely acted on the defensive, I am not now in a position to say: the evidence is extremely conflicting and for the present purpose it is safer to assume that both sides acted on the offensive. 3. While the police of both countries were endeavouring to put an end to the dispute, which took place on the sea-shore, news was brought that a more serious disturbance was taking place elsewhere. The village of Muthialpet actually forms part of Pondicherry, while Kottakuppam adjoins it both villages Iving without any intervening space, on the mam road which leads northwards from the town The boundary between the two territories crosses this road. It was at this spot that the further trouble arose A mob of French subjects, estimated to number 500, was opposed by some three hundred Kottakuppam Muhammadans. A shop just within the British territory was looted and a similar fate is said to have befallen a house lying m French territory, close to the frontier. Stones were thrown on both sides. During the progress of the riot seven European gendarmes arrived on the seme. They attempted to restrain the French crowd and the British police, consisting of a head constable and two constables, did their best to drive the Muhammadans back. Neither attempt was however, successful and eventually the police on each side fired at the opposing mob. One Muhammadan was killed by a bullet from the revolver of one of the gendarmes : several others were wounded, the number as at present reported to me being eight. On the French side none of the rioters appeared to have been hit, but a gendarme received a bullet wound in the foot and is said also to have had his coat torn by another bullet. Shortly after this His Ex cellency the Governor of the French Settlements arrived on the scene and his intervention appears to have resulted in the dispersal of the crowds. Qjq receiving information of what had taken place, the District Superin tendent of Police sent a strong force of reserve police to the spot where it still remains patrolling the frontier! the French Police ha\e been similarly strengthened. No further serious disturbance is anticipated, but as isolated attacks upon the residents of either village entering the other are not unlikely to occur, it has been arranged with the Commandant of the French gendar merie, with whom I have conferred personally, to retain the special police for the present. 5. The Superintendent of Police has under his personal investigation the offences committed in the course of the riot. A charge of dacoity will be laid at once against the persons accused of looting the British shop and application will he made to the French Government for their rendition. A general charge^ of rioting against the French offenders is, so far as we are concerned, impossible to sustain, for the evidence as to which side of the frontier was the scene of the various incidents in the riot is so conflicting as to be useless, and clearly no charge can be laid unless it can be proved that the offence took place on British territory. Taking the evidence as a whole, I think it likely that the two crowds surged backwards and forwards over a considerable distance, and alternately violated the territory of the other party, but unfortunately very early in the enquiry each side seems to have determined to avoid an awkward question by denying that it made any incursion into the territory of the other while accusing their opponents of such an incursion. In the case of the charge of dacoity, however, this difficulty does not arise, for the shop is undoubtedly in British territory. 6. As regards the use of fire-arms and the damage done on either side, I consider that the firing was entirely justified. Whether our police or the French gendarmes fired first is not agreed : each side seeks to disclaim the responsibility. In the view which I take the point is of no importance, but the probabilities, as well as some direct evidence, lead to the belief that the first firing was by the gendarmes. Indeed it seems unlikely that a head cons table with only two carbines at his disposal would have ventured to fire on the French mob, until the gendarmeshy opening fire encouraged him to do so. Our police say that they fired in the air, but this is negatived by the fact that a gendirme was wounded : it is clearly established that no fire-arms except those in the hands of the police were used. So far as regards the killing and wounding no judicial action is called for. No representation from the French19 Government on the subject of the wounding of their gendarme has been re- ceived, nor, as I understand, is any likely to be made. ^ have no definite information as to the action which is being taken by the French authorities in connection with the alleged looting of a house in their territory by the Muhammadans of Kottakuppam. The matter rests not with the French police but with their judicial authorities. Should an application for extradition be received it will be dealt with in the ordinary course. At the same time, altogether apart from the question as to which side was the aggressor, I consider that the action of the Muhammadan crowd in resisting the police and refusing to disperse when called upon to do so calls for notice from us, and I am directing that the ring-leaders should be put up to be bound over to keep the peace. II. Order—Mis. No. 1490, Judicial, dated 7th November 1908. Recorded. (True Extract.) C. J. WEIR, Acting Chief Secretary, III. No. Ref. on C. R. 866-S. A. of 1908, dated Cuddalore, the 2nd February 1909. From—A. R. Knapp, Esq., I.C.S., Special Agent and District Magistrate, South Arcot, To—The Chief Secretary to the Government of Madras. I have the honour to report as follows for the inf ormation and orders of Government. 2. In my letter of the 15th October last, recorded in G. O. No. 1490, Judicial, dated 7th November 1908, I reported that application was about to be made to the French authorities for the rendition of certain persons accused of the offence of dacoity committed during the rioting of the 7th October at Kottakuppam. The demand for their extradition was duly made, the formalities on our side being completed on the 10th November, when certain documents called for by the French Government were despatched from my office* Since then I have thrice addressed His Excellency the Governor of the French Settle ments and I have also at an interview pressed for an early compliance with my requisition, but no final reply has yet been received and the warrants remain unexecuted. From the information given me by the Governor, it appears that the matter has been referred to the Minister for the Colonies m Fans, with whom it is pending, and that the Governor is on this occasion not authorised to dispose of it. 3 Of the reasons for the departure from precedent involved m referring to Paris a matter which would ordinarily have been disposed of locally between the French authorities and myself, I have hitherto had no information, though I had reason to believe that strong political the Governor wafto the^ct'ThlrproSn^s S’the French Courts fieilhe p^eedin^ instituted or to for me to discuss, and as, on our Mde, we sho ^ Courts&gt; j offenders against whom proceedings were pending j. offic i a ii y the Governor that in as 80011 as the SStaS Cou*w. re c...Wedmdtta «»toc«if..y. Senate of'KS.StfS.. ft. V*i» of th. e.t-tlo. .&lt; 3166 F. D.20 formed part of an interpellation of the Minister for the Colonies on that date, I submit a copy of the report which has been ent to me and which I request may be returned in due course. The Minister’s speech wh.le showing that the Trench Government have no desire to question the applicability of the Conven- tion of 1815 under which each nation has undertaken to surrender its own 6 X e cts, shows also that the information supplied to him is m some essentia particulars incorrect. He states that concurrently with the institution of proceedings in our Courts, proceedings were opened m the French Courts m regard to the offences committed in French Territory ; this is so, hut it is not correct to say, as the Minister does, that “ a double set of proceedings was set on foot on the same facts in English and French territory. T le facts con cerned in the two sets of proceedings are quite distinct. Nor am I aware of anv foundation for the statement that “ discussions have taken place between the French and English Judicial authorities on the question whether the offences were committed in one or other of the territories. As pointed out in paragraph 5 of my previous letter, there is no room for doubt that the shop in Kottakuppam which was pillaged is in British territory : it is equally certain that the house which our subjects are accused of attacking is in. Irench territory. It follows that there is no foundation in fact for the apprehension expressed by the Minister lest the French Government, if it complied with the requisition for extradition, might be handing over to the British authorities French citizens prosecuted for acts which might have been committed in French territory. 5. The Minister for the Colonies also alluded to another circumstance wdiich appears to have caused him to hesitate to sanction the extradition, namely, the fact that an alibi could he proved on behalf of one of the accused by M. Lemaire, Deputy for the French Settlements. The accused in question is, I believe, Assistant to the Maire of Pondicherry, and it would appear that it is mainly on his account that the demand for extradition is so unprecedentedly opposed and delayed. How far the defence of alibi may be true I have no means of knowing, but there was nothing in the judicial record on which the demand for extradition was based to lead to any differentiation between this accused and the others. The suggestion contained in the Minister’s speech that the case against this man in the British courts should he practically prejudged by a non-judicial acceptance of his defence by the French Government is, I submit, altogether contrary to precedent and to the principles underlying the Convention between the two countries, and it implies, a distrust of the impar tiality of the British officials concerned in the matter for which, I need hardly say, there is no shadow of foundation. 6. In the circumstances I venture to suggest that steps should be taken through the usual diplomatic channel to obtain directly from the French Government early orders for the surrender of the accused. The Governor having intimated his inability to take any action now that the matter has been removed from his hands, no purpose would he served by a further reference to him. The act committed is technically dacoity, though it is not in itself of very grave moment. I am informed, how ever, that the failure of the British demand for extradition has had a very bad effect on the behaviour towards the British officials and residents in Pondicherry and Karikal of the native inhabitants of those places. I need hardly submit that at the present moment any doubt as to the efficacy of a demand for the rendition of offenders flying from British into French territory in India would constitute a serious danger. 7. A counter-demand for the rendition of the British subjects said to be concerned in the looting of a house just inside the French boundary was received by me shortly after my requisition had been made. I have not as yet complied with it, though I had every intention of doing so as soon as my demand was met. I postponed action merely in order to have a means of bringing pressure to bear upon the French authorities in support of my requisi tion. I know of no reason why the men should not stand their trial before the French Courts in the ordinary course, and if Government should consider that my omission hitherto to order their rendition weakens the case to be put before the French Government, I shall hand them over at once if so instructed. The only objection to such a course is that if, eventually, the French Govern-sion of h rtr. d ^ t\ to ? T ^ ! demand &gt; a TCr y unfavourable impres- on ot the strength of British influence will be set up in the minds of the local native population, both British and French. IY. [Translation.) Bated Pondicherry, the 8th February 1909. From M. Lemaire, Ex-Governor of the French Settlements in India, To—His Excellency the Governor of Fort St. George. On the 7th October last, on the frontier close to Pondicherry, between Kottakuppam and Muthialpet, a serious occurrence took place, in the course of which shots were fired and houses looted. Several people were wounded, one of whom was a French policeman, and there was one death, a British Indian subject. 2 . In consequence of the disturbance a double enquiry was started, one by the French courts and the other by the British authorities. 3* Being then on the spot, I was able myself to acquire an intimate acquaintance of the facts and I have set out in a local paper above my signature the origin and an account of the events. 4. Accordingly, when the British authorities of South Arcot demanded from the Governor of Pondicherry] the .extradition of eight French subjects, not only was the Procurator-General, the chief of the Judicial service, unable to advise compliance with the request for extradition for the reason that procee dings were pending (in the French Court ), but I myself gave notice to the Minister for the Colonies at Paris of my intention to raise a debate in Parlia ment in the event of this demand for extradition being acceded to. 5. Your Excellency may rest assured that, in so acting, I had not the slightest intention to place any obstacle in the way of justice being rendered ; it was because of my special knowledge of the pending matter and on account of my anxiety for right to he done and my conviction of the truth that I could not permit a real crime, which had been contrived by criminals who had fled from French territory and taken refuge close to Pondicherry, to be perpetrated by a new Magistrate who had been led into error. The Collector of South Arcot, in fact, in the course of his enquiry here, has only heard one side of the question. Having stayed with the British Consul, the intimate friend of the^ head of the political faction which opposes me, and who was associated with the chief Swadeshite Shanmugam, he was placed in communication with only the friends or protectors of the guilty persons themselves. The latter have accused innocent persons so that in default of the French Court which is better informed, the British Court might take in respect of their political adversaries measures likely to ruin and dishonour them. Amongst the French subjects, whose extradition is demanded, there is one Nandagopal Chetti, Deputy Mayor of Pondicherry, who was with meat the very moment when he is accused of having two kilometres further away commit looting which (moreover) in order to support the case, it has been pretended, was made on a small tobacco shop in a straw hut on the frontier. If Your Exceflency will be so good as to issue orders that this matter should be the subject of a supplementary enquiry at which both sides should be heard I do not doubt that the most satisfactory solution will he arrived at. It would suffice if the warrant issued against the French suhjectsweremtM^m in order that the latter who cannot permit themselves to b ® p° ° t by an unmerited arrest may go themselves to depose before the British Court. V.

No. 740-8-Political, dated the 4th March 1909. jr rom —His Excellency the Governor of Madras, To His Excellency the Governor of the French Settlements in India. I have the honour to address Your Excellency on the subject of the delay in complying with the application for the extradition of certain persons charged with dacoity committed during the riot which occurred at Kottakuppam on the 7th October last. The necessary formalities were completed on the 10th November last when certain documents called for by Your Excellency’s Government were despatched by the Special Agent. More than three months have elapsed since that date, but the warrants, I understand, have not been executed. I have, therefore, the honour to request that Your Excellency will be so good as to inform my Government when the matter is likely to be disposed of. VII. [Translation,) No. 189, dated Pondicherry, the 15th March 1909. From—M. Levecque, Governor of the French Settlements in India, To—The Collector and Special Agent, South Arcot. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 740-3- Judicial, dated the 4th instant iMarch), regarding the extradition of certain persons concerned in the Kottakuppam affair which you demanded from my predecessor on the 23rd October last. As M. Bonhoure informed you in his letters of the 13th and 29th January 1909, Nos. 22 and 50, the Minister for the Colonies in Paris has this question under his consideration and it is thus not possible for me at present to come to any decision. I must therefore await the instructions of my Government which I have solicited. Permit me, however, Sir, to point out that it appears clearly from the papers left by my predecessor that the French Courts are investigating all the (misdemeanours and) offences committed on the 7th and 8th October 1908. Judicial enquiries have been instituted regarding the riots, the hurt and inju ries to public servants and private persons ; regarding the looting of the shop and also regarding the destruction of the betel gardens. In this last affair especially 32 persons are implicated, and among them are certain of those whose extradition you have demanded. The British and French courts are therefore taking action regarding the same offence committed without any doubt in French territory (the looting of the shop of Suliman Sahib being only an episode in the troubles which marked the 7th October at Muttalpettai). In these circum stances you will perhaps come to the conclusion that the English courts have no justification for persisting in the demands for extradition which they have made. VIII.

Order—No. 1352-Judicial, dated 6th October 1909. The Governor in Council has, for reasons of State, decided that the demand for the extradition of Nandagopal Chetti and others from Pondicherry should not be pressed.

O0TACAMTJND, October 1909.Confidential.] H POLITICAL DEPARTMENT. POLITICAL. No. 1221 P.—D. From the Hon’ble Mr. E. Y. LEVINGE, i.c.s., Offg. Chief Secretary to the Government of Bengal, To THE SECRETARY to the GOVERNMENT of INDIA, Foreign Department. Dated Darjeeling, the 30th May 1910. Sib, I am directed to refer to your letter No. 356G., dated the 15th February 1910, with which was forwarded for such remarks as the Govern ment of Bengal might have to offer a copy of a despatch, No. 35-J., dated the 27th August 1909, with enclosures, from His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India on the subject of the arrangements for the mutual extradition of offenders between British and French territories^ in India. It appears from the enclosures to the above despatch that Monsieur Pichon, the French Minister for Foreign Affairs, has pledged himself to approach His Majesty s Government with a view to the modification of the terms of Article IX of the Treaty of the 7th March 1815, which was maintained in force by the latter portion of Article XVI of the General Extradition treaty concluded between the two Powers in 1876, and which governs extradition e ween e British and French possessions in India. The proposals ° ® JTu 10 - Foreign Office have not yet been formulated^ but it is unders oo a eir effect will probably be that French citizens will no longer e surren ° the British Indian Courts from the French settlements. The Seoretary of State in his despatch refers particularly to ^ an ri 8 r e s Home Department, No. 1318 P.-D., dated the 10th Qctober 1908 and desi e to be informed whether the Government of India agree wi British set forth regarding the general question of extradition e and French ^ Article JXrfthe Treaty of 1815 permits the widest possible latitude m ma ers o eriau ; re into the its terms the extraditing authority has no ■ n , j . 0 ao t on the prirnd facie validity of the charge F® ferre &gt; .

Moreover the range of extraditable °” s “ the practically unlimited; but in tlns rospect Sis™ October 1861, to the letter of the Foreign Department, No. inrh'n which excluded address of the Gover^r o^t^ French Set lemen w ’ hich WO uld not from the operations of the I reaty pe y laws of bo th countries ” and necessarily be treated as criminal acts by the laws &lt; chaDdra “political offences.” Then, in 1908 « a “ e ' .^..i offenees ” and letter to the Home Department of he (to the Foreiga DepartoentNr D.-ri-D, dated the 'kth April 1909 in which theDrotests of this Government against the resulting limitation of the scope of the Treaty were communicated to the Government of India. More over the procedure under which extradition is granted by the French authorities has since that case been made more stringent. It is known to the Government of India that the French authorities declined to act on the warrant for the extradition of Charu Chandra Ray, until supplied with full particulars of the facts upon which the charges were based. Excep tion was taken to this request for specific particulars as being contrary to the procedure contemplated by the Treaty of 1815; but as the case was one of urgency the Administrateur was furnished with the information demanded. As was to be anticipated, the French authorities have treated this case as a precedent, and on every subsequent application for extradition have demanded that full particulars as to the nature, pmce, and time of occurrence should be embodied in the warrant. A similar procedure had, it is true, been prescribed by a circular of this Government of 1879, which had been allowed to fall into disuse; and as no difficulty has been experienced in complying with requests made, the innovation, or rather revival, is not of much importance in itself.^ It tends, however, to show that the French authorities are desiious of a wider field for discretion in these matters, and in so far betrays their anxiety of which M. Flandin’s request is another indication—to assimilate the procedure governing extradition between the British and h rench possessions in India to that prevailing elsewhere. . 3. Such being the situation with regard to extradition between Bengal and Chandernagore, it appears that M. b landin, the Senator for French India, took the opportunity of the discussion which arose in the Senate in connection with the supplementary Extradition Treaty between Great Britain and France to assail the existing system from a fresh quarter. The principle for which he contended was that the provisions in the first article of the new Treaty under discussion—that each of the high contracting parties should be at liberty to refuse to the other the extradition of its own national^ subjects—should be enforced in India as elsewhere. The question of the desirability or otherwise of a universal application of this principle lies somewhat beyond the scope of a Provincial Government; the matter is essentially one of international policy to be determined with reference to diplomatic considerations ^ by the respective Home Governments. But Sir Edward Baker considers it incumb ent on him to urge that the conditions of Ghandernagore are^ altogether exceptional and demand special treatment. As a result of its isolation in the midst of British territory, and of its narrow extent, Chandernagore has never enjoyed the self-contained life of an independent community. The majority of its Indian inhabitants find their social and business relations in Calcutta and the neighbouring British districts of Hooghly and Howrah, and even in its political life it is sensitive to the conditions prevailing in British Bengal. These intimate mutual relations appear to the Lieutenant-Governor to warrant an overlapping of jurisdiction on the part of the Courts of the respective Governments which elsewhere might perhaps be open to objection* But the theoretical argument is not one which Sir Edward Baker desires to press ; and it is on practical grounds that he prefers to oppose the proposed innovation. 4. To turn to the concrete cases which M. Flandin advances in support of his contention, it appears that he relies largely on abuses which are said to have occurred in connection with the extradition of Charu Chandra Ray in 1908. With the case of the Deputy Mayor of Pondicherry this Government has no concern, and can offer no comment thereon. But M. Flandin makes so much of the proceedings in regard to Charu Chandra Ray, and his account throughout is so misleading, that it appears necessary to review his allegations in the light of the facts of the case as already reported to the Government of India in Mr. Duke’s confidential letters Nos. 1818P., dated the 10th October 1908, and 206P., dated the 16th January 1909. M. Flandin makes it a grievance that the surrender of Charu Chandra Ray was demanded on the mere production of a warrant of arrest unaccompanied by any statement of the purposes for which extradition was required. He asserts that it was only after long discussions that it was decided to inform the Chandernagore authorities that Charu Chandra Ray was charged with an attempt to murder the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal. It is true that the original warrant on which the arrest of CharuChandra Ray was required did not specify full particulars of the nature time and place of the occurrences in respect of which he was charged ’ The omission, however, was, as has been stated above, strictly in accordance with the procedure which had up to that date been in force. It is true that the subsequent negotiations were unduly protracted; but this was due to the dilatoriness of the French authorities in formulating their demands, and not to any backwardness of this Government in complying with them. The facts are that the original warrant was forwarded to Chandernagore on the 19th May 1908; but it was not until the 15th June 1908 that the Administrateur replied demanding further particulars, and those particulars were furnished to him three days later. He alleges that when Charu Chandra Ray was brought before the Criminal Court of Calcutta the charge against him lamentably failed, his innocence being publicly established. As the Government of India are aware, this is not a correct account of what occurred. The Additional Magistrate of the 21-Parganas, after enquiring into the charges against Charu Chandra Ray and the other accused, found the facts on which the charges rested so far established that he committed him along with the other accused to the Court of Sessions, The facts which the Magistrate considered to be sufficiently proved to warrant com mitment were those which had been reported to the French authorities in support of the demand for extradition. The Magistrate, however, considered that the trial should proceed under sections 121, 121 A, and 123, Indian Penal Code, which were sections not named in the original warrant; and it was decided by the Government of India that the case against him should be withdrawn, as it was held that although the facts on which extradition was required and those on which his trial was to proceed were the same, yet since sections 121, 121 A, and 123, Indian Penal Code, were of a political complexion, it was undesirable to proceed with the charges in view of the existing Treaties between France and Great Britain governing extradi tion for political offences. It is not the case that his innocence was established. So far as the judicial proceedings went,_ a pnma facie case^ was made out against him; and it was on diplomatic rather than on judicial grounds that he was released. M. Flandin then turns to the proceedings subse quent to the withdrawal of the charges under sections 121, 121A, and 123 Indian Penal Code, on which he makes the following observations:— One would imagine it only remained to set him at liberty and permit him to go back to French territory; but he was detained, and it was given out as a pretext that there was a fresh enquiry to be held against him m continuation of tho first charge in connection with the possession by him of explosive ^ The^seoond charge did not fare better than the ^ As regards these nroeeedings the views of this Government were set forth m Mr Duke s confidential letter No. 48 P., dated the 8th November 1908, and in his letter authorities, in accordance with their requisi ion, ^ offences. ^In these no objection to the instance that Charu Chandra Ray’s circumstances it was decided ^ ,, rwip would be no ba circumstances it was aeeiueu r^riion Ppnal Code would be no bar discharge in respect of it was accordingly proposed to place to his Pf , secutl °“ 'w^ct A doubt was subsequently raised whether objection him on trial under that Act^ a uou to such nroceedings on the ground might not be taken by the Frenc i au ^ rm s Act in force in French that there was no enactment C 01 T d e ^°y i ] t ° Act wou ld not be punishable under territory, and that offences under that joum ^ ^ French law; and it was decide^ ^ enoount ered in substantiating the added of murder.

The suggestion short the facts of the ? as ® a ® Chandra Ray’s extradition was demanded by involved in his account is that Cha ^.^ ^ oq inguffioient; grounds. For this Government without due ^ the resll i t wou ld have been had the this suggestion there is no “ - b ht to a conclusion it is useless at presen proceedings against him Been urou 0t ( 4 ) to discuss; but a prima facie case was made out against him, and the Lieutenant- Governor sees no reason to doubt his complicity in the conspiracy. The fact that he was twice released is to be attributed entirely to the delicacy of the diplomatic considerations which hold between the respective Home Govern ments with regard to extradition for political offences. 5. Sir Edward Baker therefore considers that the conclusions to be drawn from the case of Charu Chandra Ray are very different from those which M. Flandin asked his hearers to accept. The _ negotiations in that case have revealed the weakness of the British position in respect of extradition for political offences, and have perpetuated that weakness in an intensified form. It is true that since the orders of 1861 it has been understood that political offences were outside the range of extradition; but no occasion for the definition of the term 11 political ^ had arisen, and this Government had every right to expect that it would be interpreted in a liberal sense, with reference not only to Indian conditions, but also to the terms of Act YII of 1854, which was referred to in those orders and under which treason against the Sovereign was expressly reserved as one of the heinous offences for which extradition might be demanded. The effect of the precedent which Charu Chandra Ray’s case has established is seriously to restrict the freedom of extradition for offences in the least degree tinged with a political character. His Honour anticipates that it will become difficult to obtain the surrender of persons charged even with overt acts of murder or violence punishable under the common law of both nations, if these are alleged to bear a political complexion. Difficulties of procedure have been enhanced by the acceptance of the principle that the charges finally drawn must not differ from those set out in the extradition warrant; and the extension of the phrase “petty local offences ” to offences punishable under the Arms Act and the Explosive Substances Act removes from the jurisdiction of the British Courts a common and dangerous class of political crime. These are serious inroads upon the policy of mutual extradition that originally obtained. A further restriction is now proposed. His Majesty’s Foreign Office anticipates that the effect of these proposals will be that the extradition of French citizens will be absolutely barred. His Honour understands that it is intended that the exemption should extend only to French citizens strictly so-called, that is to the classes possessing the right of voting. In Chandernagore these number only 3,200 out of a total population of 26,000; but they comprise the majority of the educated classes,—the section of the community that has chiefly to be taken into account in connection with political crime. The proposal is one which His Honour cannot contemplate without grave misgiving The effect on the general administration of justice is a consideration which he does not desire to press, having regard to the numerical unimportance and generally law-abiding character of tbe classes affected, although it may not unreasonably be expected that the professional criminals of Chandernagore will take advan- tage^ of any weakening of the extradition law to manifest increased activity in British territory. But the development of Chandernagore as a centre of the revolutionary party raises another set of considerations. The Alipore bomb case and subsequent cases tried in our Courts have disclosed the existence of a far-reaching criminal conspiracy with wholesale murder for its object. In the Alipore case two other French subjects, Upendra Nath Banerji and Kanai Lai Dutt, were implicated with Charu Ray in the conspiracy. The former was sentenced to transportation for life, the convictiop being upheld by the High Court; and the latter was sentenced to death and executed for the murder of the informer Norendra Nath Gossain. Secret societies in sympathy with the seditionists are known to exist in Chandernagore, and there is every reason to believe that the place, situated as it is within a dangerously short distance from Calcutta, forms a safe and convenient rallying ground for the conspirators. There are also strong grounds for the belief that arms and ammunition are smuggled into Bengal from Chandernagore, and no adequate steps to check such contraband traffic have so far been taken by the I rench authorities. I he situation of this small and insignificant portion of French territory in the heart of the Bengal districts renders it difficult for the French Government to maintain an administration sufficiently power ful to deal with the various forms of illegal activity and organized crime which are known to exist. In face of this situation His Honour would not willingly surrender a single weapon from his armoury. It is true that the The fa&lt;D fiench f t lie politic of the Dotread ; 1 tionofth the i ncre imposes “petty lc ofextrad: Those on rated in • | ofheino His Hoi dehnitioi letter of political sovereigi establish alternati to-day. ! is one ' importai i nagore i j principh tion. 1 that in British or prest aiithorit adminis ( Britain control Chaode unrest i : | is it to ioreign foreign ’ separat that pa at Cha taken ] nagore Chand tobrin depenc tthicti l Wsii only stride the If altern hecon CllSto] avert | « nV8rf) ( : 5 ;) the limitations which have been allowed to grow un around ti,„ • , t , extradition have seriously diminished the value of that rio-ht in nnlv “i ?lt ° f The fact remains that the British Courts may still lelnf h e \^S ef a French subject guilty of heinous offences even of a political origin, provided that the political aspect of the charge he not pressed. In view of the development of the past few years that is a privilege which the Lieutenant-Governor would not readily torego. Indeed, so far from consenting to any repeal or modilW tion of the Treaty of 1815, he is convinced that those d^Zpments estabth the increasing necessity of adhering to the terms of that Treaty and of imposing strict limitations upon the meaning of the terms “political” and “petty local offences if these are to continue to be excluded from the ran™ of extraditable offences. It was not the intention of the orders of 1861 that acts amounting to waging war against the King should be so excluded. Those orders cleany contemplated that the heinous offences especially enume rated in Act VII of 1854: should be subject to extraditioQj and one of that list of heinous offences is treason against the Sovereign. In this connection His Honour desires to invite attention to the observations on the legal definition of the term Apolitical” contained in paragraph 6 of Mr. Duke’s letter of the 10th October 1908. It was pointed out that to constitute a political offence in the strict sense, there must be two parties striving for sovereignty in the State. It is not enough that there should be opposition to established authority; there must be an organized attempt to set up an alternative Government. This is a condition not fulfilled in British India of to-day. His Honour still believes that this distinction is sound in law, and it is one which should be pressed in this connection in view of the extreme importance of limiting any further extension of the term, 6. It has been urged above that the peculiar circumstances of Ohander- nagore afford a valid answer to any theoretical claim for an extension of the principles of international law. The argument has a more practical applica tion. The French possessions in India are so insignificant and so isolated that in effect French authority derives its sanction from the power of the British Government. Any movement which tends to weaken the power or prestige of the British Government must react unfavourably upon the authority of France, and must be a matter of grave concern to the French administration. It is, therefore, to the interests of France no less than of Britain that this Government should maintain the fullest possible measure of control over the revolutionary movement. Moreover, the political life of Chandernagore is so largely affected by the conditions prevailing in Bengal that unrest in British territory necessarily means unrest in Chandernagore.^ Nor is it to be expected that a movement having as its aim the extermination of foreign domination should discriminate in its activities between the various foreign powers. However convenient the existence of Chan ernagore as a separate political entity may be to the revolutionary paity, it is certain a. that party, sooner or later, will tarn its attention to the French administration at Chandernagore. Indeed signs are not wanting that this has already taken place, for a plot against the life sr«r.°. 'rSti i-s i. 'tVszs to bring to the notice of his hearers. It appears to His Ho n0 “r that the dependence of French on British interests in this matter is an important which cannot be overlooked in the consideration o is *. ■»* KTaSTS feels it incumbent on him to urge that the Government o ^ press f only resist to the utmost the proposed mnovatmn, but uu stricter interpretation of the terms “pontica an P ^ regen t a ti on s prove the lines above suggested.

From Viceroy, l§th May 1910^3icR/fol Foreign Secret. Your telegram of the 22nd ultimo. Arms traffic. Please see Cox s telegram No. 407, dated the 27th April, sent with Foreign Secretary’s weekly letter of the 28th April, and Admiral’s telegram of the 5th May separately telegraphed. We are at present in strong position. Effective blockade has seriously checked trade and there is reason to hope that in time we may kill it. On the other hand we are dependent on goodwill of Persians and awkward complication would ensue if French dhows were to start running in any numbers. Risk on either score is not at present great, but it cannot be ignored. In view of success of blockade we think it would have been better had communication to France been postponed until the blockade had killed the trade, as suggested in our telegram of the 14th March, but as communication has been made we have considered the situation again. We recommend blockade should continue with full rigour, and that meantime an attempt should be. made to get France to show her hand and indicate what quid pro quo she requires. (1.) Prohibition of import for a year, after an interval which allows Maskat to be flooded with arms and ammunition, and without right of search, is per se of little practical value. Moral effect will, however, be considerable if France really means to find permanent and reasonable settlement. Whole question turns on nature of quid pro quo. (2.) We think it is necessary to be very cautious about compensation at present. We are [? not] prepared to say more than that we would gladly give reasonable compensation to secure a really permanent settlement. We believe we can kill trade by naval blockade, but the process is costly and may set up friction. We should welcome reasonable settlement which would relieve us of expense and trouble of a blockade. As regards cession of territory, Madras Government reports that there are no physical difficulties in giving considerable area of land round Pondicherry, and rounding o French possessions. We shall address you separately about this, but we may say now that we could not in any case advise cession of land roun Pondicherry without an exchange for Chandernagore, the loges and other bits of French land, and that we should wish to ascertain feelings ot the British subjects who would be transferred to French rule before expressing a final op ^ ^ w ith Cox that we should have to buy the support of I ranee and the Sultan to regulation of imports and exports at Maskat. M e cordd no doubt devise a practical scheme. It would be very convenient if French Government were to send someone to India to carry o^n a 1^^ negotiations. In personal discussion many difficulties would disappear.-- — L±0 FOREIGN SECRET TELEGRAMS. Secret Department. From Viceroy, 19th May 1910. Foreign Secret. My telegram of to-day. Arms traffic. Following telegram has been received from Admiral. No. 58, 5th May. The suggested prohibition of import of arms and ammunition into Maskat for a year will probably have a very good effect as showing that both Governments are agreed in the necessity of stopping trade. It will not, however, lead to an immediate reduction of expense as there are already large stores at Oman and it is possible that placing of further large orders reported by Cox in telegram of 23rd April may be due to fact leaking out that prohibition of tins nature is in contemplation. It will therefore be necessary to maintain blockade at its present strength in order to .prevent arms already in Oman from coming over, otherwise prohibition of imports will not be of practical effect. It must be remembered also that the more stringent the blockade, the more we depreciate the value of the trade and the more easy it will become to negotiate with France. In fact I should have preferred not to have opened negotiations until after the summer, or until a dhow under French colours had actually run, or attempted to run, a cargo of arms and ammunition. [? I am of opinion that the] danger of import of arms in dhows under the French flag is not so pressing as to make it worth our while to give a large quid pro quo. [? It does not appear that the] French aie actual y trying to run arms across to the Persian coast under these conditions, ana it seems unlikely that they will deliberately do so (at least under official sanction) as this would be equivalent to giving official support to attempt to violate laws of a friendly State. ' ... n At the same time this attitude cannot be relied upon and it is possib e that efforts on the part of merchants may be made to send from Jibuti Me French dhows, which they probably already own, to engage m the trade. There are no immediate indications of this however. Under any circumstances I would deprecate any suggestion o territorial concession, as I think that we can clea ^Teef Persia Ton effectively without the assistance of France, provided we keep 1 ersia [• on 0Ur H we kill market by frightening off and preventing P CTS *°“ el '^ f ™“ f oomine- to it or by preventing them from taking deliveries ot s , even ssssa» p* a — ' p *» tea s -v* tm ’- ”• -» out 3» in Om.n 3SrT,l ff “K d“.° 1» conjunction ,ith p.oHbitio' ««» section 1*. 2«h D.c.tnb.r tat, y.t.itrch 11. nddr.s.rf to i^KLt^btVl—“ 1 rohtic.1 A g .n, ,ho« ■ h “‘™nir.'»“.S Vnftftta'; .11 intpon. »I b; «.

No. 255, dated 19th March 1910, on the subject of the Koweit dhow “ Muzaffa”. 2. About the middle of last month I sent for Saiyid Yusuf and Ewaz, the cousin of Nejef bin Ghalib, and suggested to them that they should notify Mons. Neauber that the pretended sale of the dhow by Nakoda Saleh was unauthorised and that instructions had been received from the owner Nejef to despatch the dhow under a fresh Nakoda to Koweit. I recommended that they should ask Mons. Neauber to remove the arms and ammunition from the dhow in order to admit of her being docked and caulked preparatory to the start and advised them to say that if the arms were not removed they would themselves disembark them and place them in a godown on shore pending the final decision of Mons. Neauber’s claim I assured them that if they adopted this course I would support them in any discussion that might ensue. 3. Saiyid Yusuf and Ewaz stated that the plan which I recommended was the one which they were inclined to follow and they promised to discuss it with His Highness to whom I also explained the matter in Saiyid Yusuf’s presence. Subsequently, I heard that the sale of the dhow had been completed for $ 2,000 with Nejef’s consent. I believe this result to he due partly to the fact that His Highness is anxious to avoid friction with the French until he can count on our positive assistance against them, but I think it is also largely due to the fact that Saiyid Yusuf is disgusted with the decision of Government not to afford him any compensation for the loss of his arms which were 1 consigned to Katr in the dhow “ Khairi 4. I venture to think, however, that in any case the incident is not of much importance, since Nejef bin Ghalib is evidently satisfied with the bargain and if the French had not bought the “ Muzaffa ” they would have bought some other dhow instead of it.

From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To The Foreign Department, Simla. With reference to your telegram No. 242 S., 24th April I repeat the following from Political Agent at Maskat '.—Begins. Your telegram No. 399. Unless arrangement is kept an absolute secret, I do not think that French t S ^ r m ' ch J r0m a P rohibition of import for one year, A of . s ® arch P f Ereilcl1 dh o w s is not granted. My telegram of 23rd thev 1 kLnw haVe in i°. rme . d y° u th at the arms-dealers are again active : possibly they know something is m the wind. If this be so, the French dealers will simply import large quantity of arms between now and 1st August and export them m French dhows °^ loion-m it 4i ~— i_ - -r m irenon dhows at leisure. Even if there is a prohibition, we shall presumably have to maintain a fairly strict watch, in order to prevent the stock at present in hand and imported before 1st August. For the above reasons, I do not think that prohibition for one year on terms suggested is of much value unless it is practically certain to be followed by permanent prohibition. As to the presumption, my opinion is not required. If permanent prohibition be enforced it might be advisable as a matter of expediency to compensate arms-dealers. As to third point I think a system of export would have to be started as suggested in my telegram from Bushire, No. 178, 25th February. The importation of small-bore magazine and automatic rifles without a permit might be prohibited, as local demand is still for an old-fashioned cheap rifle. I do not think that the Sultan could at present manage State monopoly or until he reorganises his customs. Indeed, until this is done, I do not see how he can put any effective restrictions on import and export. Ends. I generally endorse contents of above. Even for prohibition for one year, we should presumably incur obligation or compensation to French and Sultan, for which we should get no return if negotiations were again abortive. Mean while, blockade would still have to be maintained to keep out arms already stored in Maskat and elsewhere. Refusal by the French of right of search seems to afford us good grounds for withdrawing from the negotiations for one year’s prohibition, and I would recommend that we do so, and that then further overtures should be dropped until next spring by which time the maximum effect of blockade will have been achieved. I think it would be possible to devise system for regulating legitimate import and export which ^yould ameliorate the position a good deal, but the degree of efficacy of such a scheme would depend directly on the extent to which we could withdraw the working management from the Sultan’s hands. In order to make the scheme fully effective, it would be necessary to exercise a considerable amount of supervision over outlying ports of Oman and the Trucial Coast and this would be an expensive business. French participation would be little more than nominal, because they could not be expected to share expenses. Much the same considerations would apply to State monopoly. But for any scheme of above nature, in addition to working expenses, we should have to buy the co-operation of the Sultan and perhaps that of France. Consequently, in view of the fact that the Mekran Coast blockade is succeeding so well, I would recommend that no expensive palliative measure be proceeded with, until the blockade has reached point of greatest effect, and that another attempt should then be made to bring about a settlement of whole Maskat question with France. The indemnification of all Maskat arms vendors by the purchase of their stocks might prove an enormously expensive undertaking, and should be avoided altogether, if possible, I think. ^ In any case the contingency should only be entertained in the event of Article II of the Treaty of 1844 being effectively modified. Yendora deserve no compensation as long as we merely suppress contraband traffic.In any further communica tion on this subject, please quote N °- ($(&gt;&lt;10^ and address— / 0 The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office.

When I received your despatch M. Pichon was at Monaco for the fetes connected with the inauguration of the Oceanographical Museum.

Pichon returned to Paris on the night of the 2nd instant, and he received’m. yesterday. He said that the Political Director had submitted to him the memorandum which I had communicated to him. He knew that I had several times urged on him the injury to British interests of the traffic in arms, and the necessity to control it. He was most anxious to do what he could to meet the wishes of His J 8 Government, but there were great difficulties in the way—opposition from the Mims ry for the Colonies for financial reasons, and the objection which wo aid be made m Parliament to putting obstacles in the way of a legitimate trade unless smta i e compensation for its limitation were forthcoming. He would have to discuss the matter with the Minister for the Colonies and bring it before the Cabinet. Personally he thought that it might be possible for the Erench Government to consent to ti e prohibition of the importation of arms and ammunition into Muscat f °r ^e peiiod o one year from about two months later than the date suggested by His Majesty s Goye y rnment! hut this concession would he with the view of givmstime fora^neral settlement of the question.

M. Pichon promised to give the matter his early attention and to endeavour to persuade his colleague at the Colonial Office to meet the wishes of His Maiesty’s Government as far as might be possible. I suggested to his Excellency that the Ministry for Foreign Affairs gave too much consideration to the views of the Ministry for the Colonies in questions which affected the relations of France with foreign countries. M. Pichon replied that the Minister for the Colouies ' was bound to defend the interests of the Colonies^ and the Cabinet did not always ' prefer the views of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, and in the present case the French Parliament would blame the Government if they surrendered French rights without proper compensation.

This traffic first forced itself on the attention of Her Majesty’s Government during the Afghan war of 1879-80, and steps were taken to prevent consignments of arms and munitions of war reaching the Persian Gulf from Indian ports, while in 1881 the Persian Government, realising the dangerous possibilities of the trade as regards their own country, made the importation of arms and ammunition into Persia In the following decade the trade grew, though not to any very appreciable extent, the principal merchants being a Persian-Armenian firm and a Parsee-British house but the first great impetus to the traffic came through the Brussels Act of the 2nd Julv 1890, which put a stop to the African Slave Trade, and thereby checked the ancillary traffic in arms on the East Coast of Africa, which had flourished greatly while slaverv existed. ^ j The manufacturers and exporters of arms were thus driven to find another outlet for their goods, and it was not'jong before they found their market in the Persian Gulf. Investigations made by the Government of India showed that these arms weie not yet penetrating beyond South Baluchistan, the local demand probaMy abTOrbmg the supply, a fact the significance of which was not lost on Government or the Sultan of Muscat, since the former m 1891 mterated the Shan s edict of 1881 in stringent terms, and the latter issued a proclamation as iolio . “Let it be known by this writing that we have forbidden the import into our territory of Gwadur and its dependencies of arms and ammunition ; nothing ot kind is to be landed there or taken thence to any place whatever “ Take heed of this, and anyone transgressing this prohibition w to punishment.” Until 1890 the greater part of the arms reached the Persian Gulf from Zanribar but at this time direct shipments from Europe began, not only to Muscat, but [2659 gg —1]/ ^ -'y ' . Persian ports, where the trade grew and flourished, in spite of the Shah s prohibition. The quality, too, of the arms changed, and breech-loaders and repeating rifles took the place of muzzle-loaders and cap guns, which were no longer saleable in Arabia or Persia. At the close of 1896 the volume of trade was so great that the (rovernment India were again led to investigate the ultimate destination of the quantities of military material pouring into the Gulf, and it was found that 25 per cent, of the arms were absorbed by the Turkish possessions in the Gulf, 15 per cent, by non- Turkish Arabia, and 60 per cent, disappeared into Persia, being dispatched from Muscat through Bunder Abbas to unknown ulterior destinations. The Persian Government were thoroughly alarmed at the dimensions which the arms traffic had reached in their territories, in spite of the Shah’s proclamation of 1881, and on the 11th December, 1897, they announced that orders had been given for stores of arms, &amp;c., to be confiscated, and four days later they agreed that all mercantile vessels trading in the Gulf under the Persian flag might be searched for arms and ammunition by British men-of-war. The Persian Government also associated themselves with the British Government in requesting the Sultan of Muscat to warn his subjects of the illegality of the export of arms to Persia, and to authorise British war-vessels to search British, Persian, and Muscat ships in his territorial waters, and to seize and confiscate any cargoes of arms owned by British, Persian, or Muscat subjects found on hoard, if destined for illicit importation into Persia. The Sultan of Muscat agreed to this request, and issued a notification and proclamation in the sense required on the 13th January, 1898. The result of these measures was that between December 1897 and March 1898 some 5,239 rifles and 1,241,253 rounds of ammunition were seized at Bushire alone, while at Muscat a British steamer coming from Europe was stopped on the 24th January, 1898, by Her Majesty’s ship “Lapwing,” and relieved of 7,856 rifles and 700,000 rounds of ammunition. These seizures, joined with the independent action of the Sheikh of Bahrein, who in January 1898 attached a stock of 2,667 rifles and 637,500 cartridges belonging to a Parsee firm established there, for the moment paralysed the arms trade. The Bahrein arms and those taken by Her Majesty’s ship “ Lapwing ” w 7 ere the property of the same firm, who were reduced to bankruptcy by their loss, and there is reason to believe that the arms traffic would have been suppressed altogether but for the arrival of M. Goguyer, a French citizen, at Muscat, in March 1899. He informed the local native and Indian traders that his operations would be exempt from British interference, as he would export arms purchased from him in native vessels flying the French flag, and so successful was he, that he was followed in 1903 by Messrs. Kevorkoff and Co., and in 1905 by Messrs. Baijeot and Co., both understood to he established at Jibuti, in French Somaliland. * As a consequence of M. Goguyer’s activity, the arms traffic recovered from the check it had suffered in 1898, and in the year 1904-5 the number of rifles imported into Muscat was computed at not less than 20,000, although by that time the Sultan of Muscat had extended the prohibition of export of arms and ammunition from his territories to the African coast and islands under British protection north of Cape Guardafui, and to Italian possessions on the East Coast of Africa, and had given British and Italian ships of war power to search suspected Muscat vessels on the high seas and in Muscat territorial waters (notification dated the 17th October, 1903): although the trucial Chiefs had prohibited the import or export of arms in their territories (notifications of the 24th, 25th, and 26th November, 1902) ; although the Sheikhs of Bahrein and Koweit had prohibited the traffic in their countries and empowered British and Persian ships of war to search Bahrein and Koweit vessels in British, Persian, Bahrein, or Koweit territorial waters respectively (30th April, 1898, and 24th May, 1900); although, in fact, throughout the whole littoral of the Persian Gulf—with the exception of El Katr—as well as throughout India and the coast of Africa as far as Jibuti, traffic in arms was illegal and contraband. It is unnecessary, for the purposes of this memorandum, to trace the general growth of the arms traffic in the Persian Gulf itself from this time—1905—to the present day, but its most striking development must be briefly alluded to, since it is a matter of direct and very grave concern to His Majesty’s Government. Already in 1898 evidence had been received by His Majesty’s Government which showed that arms, &amp;c., had filtered through from the Persian Gulf by way of Afghanistan to the Ghilzai tribes in Kurram, on the north-west frontier of India, andby 1901 there was clear proof that arms and ammunition from the Persian Gulf were amvmg m large quantities in Waziristan, so much so, that the British political officer 2 ° U |&gt; azl J* 1 stan reported that he could huy locally the cartridges of a notorious Jirm of Gulf arms dealers at the rate of 5,000 a-week. The Indo-Afghan frontier 6 ?, rew £I aduall y» since the intervening markets absorbed a large number of the nttes, &amp;c., oneied for sale, but as those markets became glutted it increased pro portionately, and a new trade route was developed. Until 1903, arms for Afghanistan and the Indian frontier had been mainly purchased at Bunder Abbas and conveyed thence by the annual autumn camel caravans of Afghan merchauts, forming as it were an adjunct to the regular traffic which was the main object of the Afghan trader. But in 1903-4 a direct trade for the purpose of carrying arms and ammunition Only was organised by the Afghans, the arms being landed on the Persian-Mekran coast, where they were met by Afghans with camels. The Persian local authorities were powerless to stop the traffic, for their troops were very few and inefficient, the area of country to be dealt with was wide and communications difficult, and the Afghans moved in large well-armed bodies. Prom time to time seizures were effected by His Majesty’s ships, and in 1907 a caravan that attempted a short cut across the north-west of British Baluchistan lost 70 camels, 795 rifles, and 67,000 rounds of ammunition, but the situation at the time when the arms conference met at Brussels in April 1908 may be summed up by saying that arms and ammunition were being distributed without intermission from Muscat over the length and breadth of the Persian Gulf territories, and that a brisk and important trade in arms existed between Muscat and Afghanistan and the north-western frontier provinces of India; as an instance, it may be mentioned that in this year, 1908, one caravan alone, which reached Afghanistan on the 8th June, consisted of some 1,500 camels and 1,200 men, and carried about 30,000 rifles with about 2,000,000 rounds of ammunition, all of which came from Muscat and were landed on the Mekran coast. His Majesty’s Government had hoped that the result of the arms conference would have been to enable them to deal effectively with this evil, and in order not to prejudice the prospects of a satisfactory conclusion, they instructed their local officials in the Persian Gulf to refrain from exercising any activity at Muscat while the question was still under discussion either at Brussels or between the French and British Governments, though His Majesty’s ships continued to harass, so far as they could, the Afghan traffic on the Mekran coast. However, by the end of last year it was apparent that the result of the conference would be merely negative as regards Muscat, and His Majesty s Government were left to face a situation of the most serious nature. Both Great Britain and Russia found their difficulties in Persia greatly increased by the condition of the lawless tribes in the south, who, provided with ample supplies of modern arms and ammunition, were beyond the control of any central Persian authority, icndeied t le roads and the existence of travellers and foreign residents unsafe, and constituted a focus of disorder which made the task of restoring tranquillity m the Persian dominions almost impossible without armed intervention. But added to this was the still greater danger arising from the wholesale arming of the Afghan frontier tribes, which constituted a most serious menace to Russia on the north and the Indian Empire on the south. A semi-civilised State on the borders o acmise uropean protectorate or colony, such as Morocco on the Algerian frontier or Afghanistan on the Indian border, must always be a source of disquiet and pre-occupation to t European administration, but the latent peril bursts into the s P her ®.^ 1 aC ^ U h ^ the native State is enabled to arm with modern weapons its fanatical subjects who desire nothing more than to attack their “ unbelieving neighbours ac ™^ Nor was this all—rifles and ammunition were pouring through Afghanistan into British territory itself, and the wild border tribes might at any moment feel t e - ^Ives stron^enou^hto rise, and force His Majesty’s Government into a serious and costly cE^paign^lnvolving, in all prob.bility, disorder and ^ area No Government can tolerate, or be expected to tolerate, a situation sucn as 60 old, drawn „ at a tta. wl*„ t . it would have been expressly excluded.4 Previous experience had already shown His Majesty’s Government that it was of little use trying to check the arms traffic anywhere except at its source, and the Government of the republic must be aware, from the reports of their consular officers in the Persian Gulf, of the serious and costly steps recently taken by 11 is Majesty’s Government to this end. Aided by the powers of search conferred by thtf^ Persian Government and the Sultan of Muscat, the patrol by His Majesty s ships ot the littoral of the Persian Gulf has been so far successful that a considerable number of contraband rifles and ammunition have been seized, and the Persian and Muscat traders hive thought it more prudent to reduce, and even to withhold, for the time being the dispatch of their cargoes of arms. In short, there was good reason to hope that the object aimed at by His Majesty’s Government was m a fair way to be achieved, when they learnt to their great concern that the -hrennlijcon^ul at M usca t S had facilitated the dispatch of cargoes of arms by a Erencn citizen on a dhow, and ■Possibly other dhows, flying the French flag, in order by this means to evade the iHSatrol now being carried out by His Majesty s ships. r In view of the very serious nature of this question for His Majesty s Government, as set forth above, and of the friendly co-operation last year and in January of the present year between the British and French Governments to put a stop to a similar illicit trade in arms on the coast of Morocco, whereby His Majesty’s Government have agreed to allow the exercise of the right of search by h rench ships of war upon British vessels in the territorial waters of Morocco, and the trial of the offender before the proper tribunal, His Majesty’s Government earnestly trust that the French Government will in the same friendly manner co-operate with them to put an end to a traffic which entails grave danger to the tranquillity of the British Indian Empire and great prejudice to British interests on the Indian frontier. Confident in the readiness of the Government of the republic to accede to so legitimate a demand, His Majesty’s Government would suggest that the Sultan of Muscat should be empowered to prohibit the import of arms and ammunition into Muscat for the space of one year from the 1st June next, and that instructions should be given to the French consul at Muscat to abstain from any steps tending to facilitate the traffic in arms and ammunition with the coasts of the Persian Gulf. His Majesty’s Government would further request that their present right of search of Muscat and Persian dhows in Muscat territorial waters should he extended so as to cover dhows under the French flag for this period of one year, in the same manner as His Majesty’s Government have readily conceded a similar right of search of British ships by French Government vessels in the territorial waters of Morocco during the past and current years. &gt;. 1 As the question is one of great urgency, His Majesty’s Government would be glad to learn the views of the French Government as soon as possible.32J^ In any further communica tion on this subject, please quote no. 9071/10. and address — The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, London.

Sir E. Grey is of opinion that the Commander-in- Chief is under a misapprehension as to the scope of the instructions to British Naval Officers of 1867 which he directs His Majesty's Ships to follow when visiting ships under the French flag. Sir E. Grey is advised that those instructions must be taken as relating solely to the matter to which they v/ere specifically and in terms limited viz. the suppression of the slave trade, which origi nally formed the subject of international agreement followed RECEIVED 10' a.m. Under Secretary 4U?W^FiCF India Office.(9071/10). followed by an Act of Parliament which, so far as our municipal law is concerned, gave the requisite powers to British public ships. So far as cases otherwise within the jurisdiction of foreign states are con- corned, these powers could only be conferred by treaty or agreement. This being so the instructions cannot be con sidered applicable to quite a different subject mat ter, viz. the Arms Traffic. Sir E. Grey would, therefore, suggest for Vis count Morley*s consideration that a warning in this sense should be addressed to the Commander-in-Chief, East Indies.

I have discussed whole situation with Naval Commander-in-Chief and Colonel Cox. Blockade has been most successful so far, and if we keep it up trade will be ruined, whereas if we slacken our efforts now it will revive by the cold weather. First. —As regards proposed “ pass ” arrangement, we are aware that it was intended to supplement and not to take place of blockade, but Naval Commander-in-Chief is convinced that pass system would (not ?) practically assist blockade, and that means would be devised by smugglers of circumventing any “ pass ” system, and that nothing short of a total prohibition of export is of practical use or worth’ paying Sultan for ; and that any negotiations of that nature would create impression that we were about to slacken blockade operations. We think that it is unnecessary at present to supplement blockade with pass system. Secondly.—We are dealing with question of territorial concession to France in India, but in view of success of blockade and the proposals which follow we now think it better to avoid communication with France until blockade operations have had their full effect in killing the trade. Admiral and Cox urge, and we agree, that we should now concentrate all our efforts upon the maintenance of effective blockade on Persian coast. This would be greatly promoted by temporary installation of wireless telegraphy at Debai, Bahrein, and Bushire. We could then leave Maskat entirely alone, and simply deal with dhows in Persian waters or with cargoes when landed, our system of intelligence being now sc good. (In this way, by acting as agents of Persia in stopping the import of arms under the Agreement of 1897 and not acting [? soj for our own benefit, we should avoid international complications with France or other Powers). Third.—As regards re-assuring Sultan. All that seems necessary is that Political Officers should watch his attitude and just give him sufficient comfort to keep him from intriguing with France or Germany. We think no definite sum should be promised or mentioned to him. For the present Cox might simply tell him verbally when he passes through Maskat that we are obliged to persevere with extermination of trade on Persian coast, but will not allow him to be ruined in the process. We are altogether against giving compensation to arms dealers. On full consideration we consider political advantages of the above course to be so great that we trust you wiil concur in its adoption. Admiral will reduce cost of operations to the utmost, and considerable reduction will be possible both during height of hot season and as trade becomes gradually attenuated by our operations. Incidentally, the blockade operations are greatly promoting our influence and strengthening our hands in the Gulf generally.In any further communication on this subject, please quote 8921/10. No. and address— The Under-Secretary of State. Foreign Office, London. March /£&gt; 1910 Foreign Office Sir:- With reference to your letters of February 17th, the arms traffic in the Persian Gulf, I am directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to state, for the information of the various questions raised therein into his careful consideration. The main points which concern the Foreign Office 1. The position of a dhow under the French flag in Persian or Muscat territorial waters, and the powers of the Persian or Muscat Governments to restrain such a vessel from carrying on a traffic in arms. 2. The ability of His Majesty's Government to support the Sheikhs of Koweit, Bahrein and Mohamnerah, the Secretary of State for India, that he has taken are:- and The Under Secretary of State, India Office.(8921/10) and one Trucial Chiefs in any difficulty that may arise wiun the French Government in consequence of seizures of cargoes of arms effected under the authority of those rulers in their territorial waters. .5. The possibility of referring the attitude of France in Muscat to the Hague for arbitration, and, in connexion with this, the question of arbitration on the re-export of arms from Jibuti. Sir E. Grey's opinion on these points may be ex pressed as follows:- 1. The reported action of Monsieur Goguyer's Agent in purchasing a dhow and registering it at the French Consulate in Muscat under the French flag would seem, under present conditions, to provide the dealers in arms with a vessel that is exempt from search or seizure by His Majesty's ships. The question hangs primarily on the powers of the Persian or Muscat Govern ment to exercise restraint on such a dhow, and second arily on the extent of the mandate to exercise restraint on their behalf respectively whicn Persia or Muscat may be able to accord to Great Britain. FrancePrance, like Great Britain, possesses full extra territorial jurisdiction in Persia - (and holds a simi (8921/10) lar position in Muscat, so that the same consideration holds good for both countries) and Persia has parted to France with her jurisdiction over French citizens anc cannot derogate from her own grant by conferring on Great Britain any jurisdiction or power to interfere with French dhows in Persian territorial waters. Sir E. Grey therefore agrees with the view expressed in your letter of the 24th ultimo, that the Sadr-i-Azarn's letter of December 18th,1397, does not authorize the search by British public ships in Persian waters of any dhows irrespective of their character and nationality. The right accorded by the Persian Government only ex tends to Persian, British and Muscat vessels. On the other hand, the Persian Government has not parted and cannot part with its right to prevent a contraband trade within its own territorial waters, even if carried on under the flag of France or any other nation enjoying extraterritoriality. France is bound to see that the Customs and other general laws iv :\ I { M ■ ? for(8921/10) &amp; for the Internal government of Persia are not violated with impunity by French citizens, and either to allow breacnes of sucn laws to be punished in the Shah's Courts or by the Shah's authorities, or to provide ef fective means for punishing and restraining French citizens from acting illegally, by means of the local French tribunals and authorities. Sir E. Srey does not possess any precise informa- H 9 tion as to the procedure in Persia in cases of smuggling j offences Toy French citizens, hut assuming that France does not provide suitable and efficient means for re straining her citizens from committing breaches of the Persian Customs Law, it would certainly be open to the p Persian Government to protest againso one insufficient and even unfriendly action of France in this respect, I though whether in fact Persia would adopt this attitude without strong outside pressure rnay be considered to be doubtful- ■ The Persian Government have of course a perfect right to take active preventive measures in their territorial waters or on Persian territory uo suop the importation(8921/10) importation of arme by dhows under the French flag, but in practice this would be beyond their unaided powers to effect, and they might therefore confer on British naval officers powers to act, for this purpose, in the name anc3 - as ^' ie servants of the Shah. But though technically such an arrangement might he held to he vai^clj ^ unnecessary go point out the very serious friction that would at once ensue with France, nor would it be easy to oppose a French claim that such powers should, in the case of dhows under the French flag, he accorded to French and not to British offi cials, 2. Sir E. Grey understands that France has no special rights in Koweit, Bahrein, Mohammerah or on the Trucial Coast, and he therefore is of opinion that the line of action proposed in paragraph 2 of your letter of the 24th ultimo, in regard to the rulers of this district, should he adopted. 3. Sir E. Grey entirely agrees with the views ex pressed in your letter of the 21st ultimo, that the cases of Jibuti and Muscat should he treated separately in'l.i WTOH*. (8921/10) (fjf) in any reference to arbitration. With regard to Jibuti, ne io not, as at present advised, satisfied that the case is either strong enough to call the French Government to The Hague, or, even if it were submitted to arbitration with the result that a decision was given in favour of His Majesty's Government, that this result would he commensurate with the friction and expense involved. In respect to Muscat, I am in the first place to observe that if it can be held that the Sultan is free to prohibit the import of amis into his country. Sir E. Grey would advocate the course of inducing His High ness to take action to this end, and leaving it to the French Government to summon him or His Majesty’s Govern ment to arbitration, since the practical ef fect on the arms traffic would be greater and more immediate, and if the case itself is considered by His Majesty's Gov ernment strong enough for arbitration, action taken in accordance with their view of the case would also be justified, unless and until the Court 01 ArLitiation pronounced against them. Inmmmmsrnm wmmam (8921/10) In the present instance, however, an examination of the arguments advanced in your letter last referred to does not convince Sir E. Grey that they would hold £&gt;ood in an International Court. Taking these arguments in the order in which they are placed in your letter. Sir E. Grey is of opinion with regard to:- (l) that to hold that the arms traffic did not exist in 1844 and cannot therefore reasonably he held to he covered by the Treaty of that year, would, if maintained, result in cutting out of the benefits and application of the Treaty all trade that did not exist in 1844, and commerce in anything that has been invent- (2) Sir E. Grey believes that the view which, on the whole, finds favour with international jurists at the present day is that a Commercial Treaty which con tains no provisions for termination or denunciation is a perpetual treaty, and cannot be terminated by one of the parties without the consent of the other. Sir E. Grey is not prepared to maintain that this is v/ithout doubt a correct interpretation of international lav.'. ed or discovered since that date.(8921/10) toiu It 1 b clear that 11 it Is the general view the probabilities are that it would be upheld by a Court of Arbitration. In the case of a perpetual Treaty of which the bdujeco iiiaoter had entirely disappeared^ so that there was nothing left to which the provisions of the Treaty could apply, it would 'ex necessitate rei' lapse or be come extinguished. So also if the conditions environ ing the subject matter had become so absolutely changed that the Treaty in no respect covered the ground on which the parties originally contracted, or the natural development and. modification of that ground which the lapse of years had brought with it, it might then be argued that nothing remained of the original subject matter, contemplated by the parties, for the Treaty to operate upon. It is in the present case no doubt to some extent - a question of the degree to which the original condi tions have 'been altered, but it would be difficult to argue that they have been altered to such a decree as to justify one party in withdrawing from the Treaty against(8921/10) th.G wishes 01 Hie olhep, (o) If It could he successfully shown that the growth of the anus traffic at Muscat was a real source of danger to that state, involving her in internal dis order or embroiling her with neighbouring territories where the import of arms is forbidden, it would then be lawful for the Sultan, acting on the maxim 'Salus reipublicae suprerna lex” to override the provisions of the 1844 treaty with France in this respect, and to prohibit the arms trade in his dominions. But such a proceeding must be absolutely bona fide , and the result of the conviction of the Government of Muscat, and if it should in any way appear to be in reality due to the initiative of an outside Power, and the pretext alleged seem to be merely specious, it would be open to criticism, and France would have a right to pretest. (4) Although it is true that all the Powers repre sented at the recent Arms Conference, with the excep tion of France, were prepared to give His Majesty^ Government a free hand to deal with tne arms traffic in the Persian Gulf, none of those Powers raised any question(8921/10) question as to the legal right of the French Government I t0 mi:ualn t£ielr attitude, nor did the various Dele- j gates give expression to any views which might seem to j con&lt;leran Prtmce n ' om a “oral standpoint. The general 1 at;t/l1: ' ucie Was ^ a tner one of recognition of the incon venience of the traffic to His Majesty*6 Government, and of readiness not to hamper a fellow civilized Power in defending itself against warlike arid savage neigh bours, but there was no condemnation of French action as in any way derogating from the recognized standards of modern civilization. For this reason, end also on general grounds. Sir E. Grey is inclined to think that it would be difficult to represent to France that Muscat, a state of low civilization, was about to de nounce the Treaty because the conduct of French citi zens as approved of, or at least unrestrained by, the French Government, was contrary to undisputed doctrines of public law and to the view universally held with re gard to morals, which is, in Sir E. Grey's opinion, the practical form in which the fourth argument mentioned in your letter would have to be applied. In» ':W (8921/10) 1 ., view' oherelore of the considerations advanced aoovo, and of the many practical difficulties in the way of action in the Persian Gulf without the consent of France, Sir E. Grey would suggest that the French Gov ernment might first be approached direct on the subject Ihe negotiations attempted hitherto have, it is true, resulted in failure, and Sir E. Grey would not propose to renew at present any offers of concessions of terri tory or other compensation, but the situation in Morocco presents a close analogy to the position on the N.W. Frontier of India, and it will he difficult for the French Government to refuse to recognize the right of His Majesty's Government to ask for the same friend ly treatment in the Persian Gulf as they have accorded to France in Moroccan waters, I am accordingly to transmit to you herewith a draft Memorandum to the French Government which has been prepared in this Department, and I am to state that Sir E. Grey will be glad to learn Viscount Morley's views as to the desirability of making this communica-(as^i/io) coniriunication^ and to receive any amendments tions which His Lordship may consider should he made or altera- in its terms. In the event of this proposal being approved by the Secretary of State for India and of Its meeting with an evasive reply from the French Government, or a refusal on their part to comply with the request of His Majesty's Government, It will then become necessary to consider what further steps can be taken to exert pressure on the French Government to assume a more reasonable attitude towards the question of the arms traffic in the Persian Gulf. I am. Your most obedient. humble Servant,MEMORANDUM. &gt;y. ’21/10) The French Government are well aware, both from the proceedings of the International Arms Conference at Brussels, which closed on December 30th, last, and from the separate negotiations of 1908-9 between France and Great Britain, of the great and increasing damage that is being done to British interests by the existing traf fic in arms in the Persian. Gulf. This traffic first forced itself on the attention of Her Majesty's Government during the Afghan War of 1879-1881, and steps were taken to prevent consignments of arms and munitions of war reaching the Persian Gulf from Indian Ports, while in 1881 the Persian Government, realising the dangerous possibilities of the trade as % regards their own country, made the importation of arms and ammunition into Persia illegal. In the following decade the trade grew, though not to any very appreciable extent, the principal merchants being a Persian-Armenian firm and a Parsee-British house, but the first great impetus to the traffic came throughthrough the Brussels Act of July 2nd, 1890, which put a stop to the African slave trade and thereby checked the ancillary traffic in aims on the East Coast of Africa, which had flourished greatly while slavery existed. The manufacturers and exporters of arms were thus driven to find another outlet for their goods and it was not long before they found their market in the Per sian Gulf. Investigations made by the Government of India showed that these arms were not yet penetrating beyond South Baluchistan, the local demand probably ab sorbing the supply, a fact the significance of which was not lost on either the Persian Government or the Sultan of Muscat, since the former in 1891 reiterated the Shah's edict of 1881 in stringent terms, and the latter issued a proclamation as follows Suoh as Fishkan* 'Let it 'he knovm, hy this writing that we nave 'forbidden the import into ovr te^itory of Gwadu^ and its 'dependencies*of arms and ammunition', nothing of the kind 'is to he landed the^e or taken theme to any place what- ^ r .

' UntilJnuil 1890 the greater part, of the arms reached the Persian Gulf from Zanzibar, but at this time direct shipments from Europe began, not only to Muscat, but to Persian ports, where the trade grew and flourished, in spite of the Shah’s prohibition. The quality, too, of the arms changed, and breech-loaders End repeating rifles took the place of muzzle loaders and cap guns, which were no longer saleable in Arabia or Persia. At the close of 1896 the volume of trade was so great, that the Government of India were again led to investigate the ultimate destination of the quantities of military material pouring into the Gulf, and it was found that 25% of the arms were absorbed by the Turkish possessions in the Gulf, 15% by non-Turkish Arabia, and A’n 60^ disappeared into Persia, being despatched from Mus cat through Bunder Abbas to unknown ulterior destina tions . The Persian Government were thoroughly alarmed at the dimensions which the arms traffic had reached in their territories, in spite of the Shah's proclamation of 1881, and on December 11th. 1897, they announced that orders had been given for stores of arms, etc., to be’be confiscated, and four days later they agreed that all mercantile vessels trading in the Gulf under the Persian flag might he searched for arms and ammunition r hy British men-of-war, fon the condition that any contra- hand that was found should he seized and handed over to the Persian authorities.! The Persian Government also associated themselves with the British Government in requesting the Sultan of Muscat to warn his subjects of the illegality of the export of arms to Persia and to authorise British wa.». vessels to search British, Persian and Muscat ships in his territorial waters and to seize and confiscate any cargoes of arms owned by British, Persian or Muscat subjects found on board, if destined for illicit impor tation into Persia. The Sultan of Muscat agreed to this request, and issued a notification and proclama- t IT l tion in the sense|required|on January 13th. 1898. The result of these measures was that between De cember 1897 and March 1898 some 5,239 rifles and 1 241 253 rounds of ammunition were seized at Bushire alone, while at Muscat a British steamer corning from Europe was stopped on January 24th. 1898, by Her Majes ty'sMajesty's Ship 'Lapwing' and relieved of 7,856 rifles and 700,000 rounds of ammunition. These seizures, joined with the independent action of the Sheikh of Bahrein, who in January 1898 attached a stock of 2,667 rifles and 637,500 cartridges belong ing to a Parsi firm established there, for the moment paralyzed the arms trade. The Bahrein arms and those taken by Her Majesty’s Ship 'Lapwing' were the property of the same firm, who were reduced to bankruptcy by their loss, and there is reason to believe that the arms traffic would have been suppressed altogether, but for the arrival of Monsieur Goguyer, a French citi zen, at Muscat in March 1899. He informed the local native and Indian traders that his operations would be : \ exempt from British interference, as he would export arras purchased from him in native vessels flying the . French flag, and so successful was he, that he was fol lowed in 1903 by Messrs. Kevorkoff and Company and in 1905 by Messrs. Baijeot and Company, both established at Jibuti, in French Somaliland. As a consequence of Monsieur Goguyer's activity the ams traffic recovered from the check it had suffer. edsulfered in 1898, and in the year 1904-1905 the number of rifles imported into Muscat was computed at not less than 20,000, although by that time the Sultan of Muscat had extended the prohibition of export of arms and am munition from his territories to the African coast and islands under British protection North of Cape Guarda- fui, and to Italian possessions on the East coast of Africa, and had given British and Italian ships of war power to search suspected Muscat vessels on the high seas and in Muscat territorial waters,! any arms found being confiscated to His Highnessi (Notification dated October 17th. 1903): although the Trucial Chiefs had prohibited the import or export of arms in their terri tories (Notifications of November 24th. 25th. and 26th. 1902): although the Sheikhs of Bahrein and Koweit had prohibited the traffic in their countries and empowered British and Persian ships of war to search Bahrein and Koweit vessels in British, Persian Bahrein or Koweit territorial waters respectively (April 30th. 1898, and May 24th. 1900): although, in fact, throughout the whole littoral of the Persian Gulf - 'with the exception of El Katr as well as throughout India and the coast ofof Africa as far as Jibuti, traffic in arms was illegal and contraband. It is unnecessary, for the purposes of this Memor andum, to trace the general growth of the arms traffic in the Persian Gulf itself from this time - 1905 - to the present day, but its most striking development must be briefly alluded to, since it is a matter of direct and very grave concern to His Majesty’s Government. Already in 1898 evidence had been received by His Majesty’s Government which showed that arms etc., had filtered through from the Persian Gulf by way of Af ghanistan to the Ghilzai tribes in Kurram, on the North West Frontier of India, and by 1901 there was clear proof that arms and ammunition from the Persian Gulf were arriving in large quantities in Waziristan, so much so that the British Political Officer of Southern Waziristan reported that he could buy locally the cart ridges of a notorious firm of Gulf arms-dealers at the rate of 5,000 a week. The Indo-Afghan frontier trade grew gradually, since the intervening markets absorbed a large number of the rifles etc., offered for sale, but as those markets became glutted, it increased pro portionately,proper tionately &gt; and a new trade route was developed. Until 1903, arms for Afghanistan and the Indian fron- had been mainly purchased at Bunder Addas and con veyed thence by the annual autumn camel caravans of Af- ghan merchants, forming as it were an adjunct to the ^regular traffic which was the main object of the Afghan trader. But in 1903-4 a direct trade for the purpose of carrying arms and ammunition only was organized dy the Afghans, the arms deing landed on the Persian Mek- ran coast, where they were met dy Afghans with camels. The Persian local authorities were powerless to stop the traffic, for their troops were very few and ineffi cient, the area of country to be dealt with was wide and comminications difficult, and the Afghans moved in large, well-armed bodies. From time to time, seizures (Jr were effected dy His Majesty's Ships, and/a caravan A that attempted a short cut across the North West of British Baluchistan lost 70 camels, 795 rifles and 67,000 rounds of ammunition, but the situation at the time when the Arms Conference met at Brussels in April, 1908, may be summed up dy saying that arms and ammuni tion were deing distributed without intermission from MuscatMuscat over the length and breadth of the Persian Gulf territories, and that a brisk and important trade in arms existed between Muscat and Afghanistan and the North-Western frontier provinces of India; as an in stance, it may be mentioned that in this year, 1908, one caravan alone, which reached Afghanistan on June dr—^ /S o o 1,000 men, and carried 12,500/rifles with about 2,000,000 rounds of ammunition —4 * all of which came from Muscat and were landed on the Mekran coast. His Majesty's Government had hoped that the result of the Arms Conference would have been to enable them to deal effectively with this evil, and in order not to prejudice the prospects of a satisfactory conclusion, they instructed their local officials in the Persian Gulf to refrain from exercising any activity at Muscat while the question was still under discussion either at Brussels or between the French and British Governments, though His Majesty's Ships continued to harass, so far as they could, the Afghan traffic on the Mekran coast. However, by the end of last year it was apparent that the result of the Conference would be merely nega tivenegative as regards Muscat, and His Majesty's Govern ment were left to face a situation of the most serious nature. Both Great Britain and Russia found their difficulties in Persia greatly increased by the condi tion of the lawless tribes in the South, who, provided wi ample supplies of modem arms and ammunition, were heyond the control of any central Persian authority, rendered the roads and the existence of travellers and foreign residents unsafe, and constituted a focus of disorder which made the task of restoring tranquillity in the Persian dominions almost impossible without arm ed intervention. But added to this was the still greater danger arising from the wholesale arming of the Afghan frontier tribes, which constituted a most se rious menace to Russia on the North and the Indian Em pire on the South. A semi-civilized state on the bor ders of a civilized European protectorate or colony, such as Morocco on the Algerian frontier or Afghanistan on the Indian border, must always be a source of dis quiet and preoccupation to the European administration, but the latent peril bursts into the sphere of actuali ty when the native state is enabled to arm with modern weaponsweapons its fanatical subjects, who desire nothing more tnan to attack their ’unbelieving* neighbours across uhe border. .,or was this all - rifles and ammunition were pouring through Afghanistan into British territory itself, and the wild border tribes might at any moment feel themselves strong enough to rise, and force His Majesty's Government into a serious and costly campaign, involving in all probability, disorder and disturbance — v '' C\ throughout the whole!extent of the Indian Empire! No Government can tolerate or be expected to tolerate a situation such as this, or passively to watch the growth of a trade which threatens to subvert the order and well-being which that Government is bound to uphold - a trade moreover -which only exists to-day, in defiance of the wishes openly proclaimed of the Rulers of Muscat and of the neighbouring states, owing to the chance wording of a Treaty over sixty years old, drawn up at a time when the traffic in arms had not been foreseen and did not exist even in the imagination of the framers of the treaty, though had it done so, the whole history of international relations in modern times leaves no doubt that it would have been expressly excluded. PreviousPrevious experience had already shown His Majesty's Government that it was oi little use trying to check the arms traffic anywhere except at its source, and the Government of the Republic must be aware, from the re ports of their Consular Officers in the Persian Gulf, of the serious and costly steps recently taken by His Majesty’s Government to this end. Aided by the powers of search conferred by the Persian Government and the Sultan of Muscat, the patrol by His Majesty’s Ships of the littoral of the Persian Gulf has been so far success ful that a considerable number of contraband rifles and ammunition have been seized, and the Persian and Muscat traders have thought it more prudent to reduce and even to withhold for the time being the despatch of their cargoes of arms. In short, there was good reason to / hope that the object aimed at by His Majesty’s Govern ment was in a fair way to be achieved, when they learnt to their great concern that the French Consul at Musca^ had facilitated the despatch of cargoes of arms by a French citizen on a dhow, and possibly other dhows, flying the French flag, in order by this means to evadt the patrol now being carried out by His Majesty’s Ships In/3 In viev/ of the very serious nature of this ques tion for His Majesty's Government, as set forth above, and of the friendly co-operation last year and in Janu ary of the present year between the British and French Governments to put a stop to a similar illicit trade in arms on the coast of Morocco, whereby His Majesty's Government have agreed to allow the exercise of the right of search by French ships of war upon British vessels in the territorial waters of Morocco and the trial of the offender before the proper tribunal, His Majesty's Government earnestly trust that the French Government will in the same friendly manner co-operate with them to put -an end to a traffic which entails and great prejudice to British interests on the Indian frontier. Confident in the readiness of the Government of the Republic to accede to so legitimate a demand. His Majesty's Government would suggest that the Sultan of Muscat should be empowered to prohibit the import of A/VVV-i.* tvvw. i-l-u arras into Muscat for the space of one year and that in structions should be given to the French Consul at Mus- grave danger British Indian Empire cat|p Muscat to abstain from any steps tending to facilitate a i . $WVV-w. •*- 8^,- t-v the traffic in arms with the coasts of the Persian Gulf. His Majesty's Government would further request that their present right of search of Muscat and Persian dhows in Muscat territorial waters should be extended so as to cover dhows under the French flag for this period of one year, in the same manner as His Majesty's Government have readily conceded a similar right of search of British ships hy French Government vessels in the territorial waters of Morocco during the past and current years. As the question is one of great urgency. His Ma jesty's Government would he glad to learn the views of the French Government as soon as possible. Foreign Office.

No. 64, dated the 1st January 1910. From—The Assistant Superintendent, Jask Sub-Division, To—The Political Resident, Bushire. I have the honour to submit a report of the importation of arms and ammunition on the Mekran Coast for the half-year ending the 31st December 1909. 2. At the close of my last report (No. 40, dated the 1st July 1909) eight patrols were employed and these were retained throughout the summer. Three more patrols have recently been engaged and posted as follows:— One at Ziarat, Bierban district, 12th November 1909. One at Upper Jagin, Jask district, 11th December 1909. One at Rodi, Dashtiari district, 1 st December 1909. The present distribution of patrols is as follows:— West of Jask. One at Ziarat, Bierban district. One at Gunari, do. One at Bunji, do. One at Gangan, Jask district. East of Jask, One at Arduri, Jask district. One at Jagin Balad, do. One at Gabreg, do. One at Soorug, Gaih district. One at Rapch, Karwan district. One at Bir, Geih district. One at Rodi, Dashtiari district. In addition to the patrols to the westward of Jask, presents have been paid to a few trustworthy men who are engaged as runners to pass on inform ation in relavs to Jask. .. , 3 Consignments imported by Afghans (Appendix A) show an enormous increase The chief feature is the large number of rifles imported com paratively early in the season, during the months of September, October and November. A1 It will be seen in Appendix D that during these months there were very few Afghans on the coast, the influx commencing in November which is the usual time of their arrival. Arramrements were very secretly made between the Afghan gun-runners, Ali Mo^of Maskat and Mir Barkat of Bierban, for the latter to act as their All Moosa oi ma ^ receiving and storing consignments of rifles to be ™ over to the Bierban coast earlier than usual, undoubtedly with the object of avoWing the expected activity of His Majesty’s ships engaged during the season in the suppression of the traffic. h Hi A i ! t8 i Although good information of the arrangements made between Mir Barkat and the four Afghans then on the coast was reported it was not till the Idth of September that I realized the proportions winch this new development was likely to take. . 4 The following is a list of the approximate number of rifles, consigned to Afghans and stored by Mir Barkat, which were landed on the Jask Bierban coatt by the end of October, and which were stored at places quite close to the .1 si iv 1 ]it nn trnnVflP.fl ! No. of rifles. Place where stored. Position. Remarks. 2,000 Giegan, Jask district ... 5 miles west of old Jask and 3 miles from the sea. Among hills. 3,000 Rao, do. 5 miles east of Gangan and about 5 miles from the sea. Small village in hills. 2,000 Sirik, Bierban district ... 2 miles from the sea In Mir Haji’s house. 900 Total ... 7,900 Sarzhai, do. 14 miles north of Sirik and about 12 miles from Ziarat. Near old Portu- gu» se fort of Sarzhai. 5 Another feature of the present season’s operations is the presence of Afghans in the Dashtiari district where some large consignments have been landed. They were assisted by Mir Mahmud Khan of Dashtiari, who, I hear, has realised a considerable amount of money, and also by a Baluch of the Shaizada tribe named Dad Karim, who was iormerly in the service of the Nazim of Mekran. One consignment of 950 rifles w^as actually landed at Pishkan in the Sultan of Maskat’s territory and stored in the hills at, the head of the Gwadur West Bay about a mile from the sea. Fifty of these rifles w^ere removed by Afghans through British Baluchistan to Dashtiari, thirty were taken by the Wall of Pishkan and 850 were captured by a landing party of H. M. S. Perseus”. It is satisfactory to note that out of some 5,500 rifles shipped from Maskat and consigned to Afghans operating to the east of Charbar, only 2,ld0 rifles were actually landed and removed, wFile the remaining 3,370 rifles we captured by His Majesty’s ships. 6. Referring to Appendix B, it will he seen that Baluchis have imported fewer rifles, compared with the corresponding period of the previous year 7. During the present season 1 have obtained more accurate information of the quantity of ammunition imported. The figures in Appendix B are very reliable, but the total compares favourably with my former approximate calculation of 100 rounds per rifle. All approximate quotations in the Appendices will be found marked with an (*) asterisk. 8. Captures and losses inflicted, shown in Appendix C, are greatly in excess of the previous year, which is attributable to the increased number of ships employed and also very largely to the great keenness and energy exhibited by the Senior Naval Oifiocr, Captain Hunt, and Commanders of His Majesty’s ships engaged in the suppression of the traffic. 9. Owing to the severe losses the temper of the Afghans, particularly those operating to the eastward of Charbar, w r as considerably disturbed and I believe in some cases ship’s cutters w T ere tired on by parties of Afghans on shore. This animosity has been increasing lately, and many threats, emanating from different sources, have been current, pointing to the intention of the Afghans to capture an European and hold him for a ransom in exchange for rifles captured by His Majesty’s ship.k in December? ° f ^ t0 the tele ^P h *&gt;7 Afghans was reported dix E° I)eparture9 of arms 0 «avans from the coast are shown in Appen- . 1 * end “ed to place all available information gathered from telegraphic reports m the appended statements of my report. C ^ Ilcl ^ S i? n 1 ^ 0 ' ld res pectfully beg to draw attention to the &lt;mod work done by the Officers m Charge of the Charbar and Jask Stations. ° • I)urm S tlie past three years Mr. McMeekin has taken a very keen interest m the arms traffic and controlled all the information of Afghans operating in the Dashtiari district m the season 1907-08 and also in the present season. Ihis expression of my appreciation of his assistance and co-operation, is, I am sure, also shared by Commander of His Majesty’s ships. During my absence on tour all information emanating from Jask is controlled by Mr. Gumming. I would beg to recommend Jemadar Dilmorad of the patrol establishment for special recognition of his services. He has always taken a very intelligent interest in his duties and his tactfulness, during the past three years, in main taining absolute secrecy of the work carried out by the many patrols posted in the Jask and Bierban districts is to be highly commended.

Field of operation of Afghans is enlarging owing to restrictions in Mekran sphere, and Rao reports that arms stocked at Disbgun, a little to south of Lingah and 16 miles inland, are being sold to their^ agents, and I also hear that some 300 r ifl es have been brought from Katr to Shivuh on the mainland opposite to Sheikh Shuaib Island. With a view to check this traffic, it might be worth while if a gun-boat were made available to have one cruise between Sheikh Shuaib Island and Henjam.

With reference to the above-quoted letter and to your telegram of the same date, I am to forward a report from the Commanding Officer of the “ Hyacinth ” on this subject. 3. His Excellency has given instructions that the value of the sweetmeats is to be recovered from the Seedie Boys and forwarded to you. He has also given orders which he hopes will prevent a recurrence of such an incident. The Political Agent, Maskat. I have, «fec., Victor H. T. Welkes, Secretary to the Commander-in-Chief. Alleged ill-treatment of dhow. H.M.S. “ Hyacinth ” at Jask, 1st February 1910. b. 31. In accordance with your order of 30th instant regarding the alleged ill- eatment of the dhow “ Muzaffa,” also with reference to the subsequent papera l the same subject-dated at Maskat 30th January-I have the honour to port as follows:— ^. J x mi 2. I am assured by the officer who boarded the dhow, Lieutenant Thomas . Bassett, R.N.B., that none of the crew were ill-treated. . Certain members of the dhow’s crew at first all ^ T “|a le examination of the cargo, and Lieutenant Bassetjudged^nece^aryas rr -— “ d ie slightest ground for the statement that one ot the duow ounded by a bayonet, or in any other way./ In beins? prepared for a surprise attack Lieutenant Bassett was acting in accordance with my orders. 3. As to the alleged theft of sweetmeat, I fear that there may be some ground for complaint. Durino* the afternoon, after the verification of the cargo, a party of Suaheli Seedie Boys was employed in restowing the cargo. Though it is not easy to arrive at the exact facts, I have a strong suspicion that they did take some sweetmeat, either with or without the consent of the dhow’s crew. Since there is no satisfactory evidence as to the quantity, I am willing to accept the nakoda’s statement that 25 packets were taken. Pending settlement of the matter I have placed the Seedies under arrest, and with your approval I propose to punish them for a gross breach of disci pline ; also to recover from them the value of 25 packets of sweetmeat and to forward the amount to the Political Agent at Maskat for settlement in the proper quarter. 4. On receiving your order to release the dhow, I sent an officer to the nakoda to return to him his papers with instructions to enquire whether the nakoda was fully satisfied and whether all his property was correct and in good order. The reply, which was reported to me before the dhow shoved off, was that the nakoda was* quite satisfied and that he had everytning. I submit that this assurance, given formally to an officer in the presence of witnesses, shows that the nakoda had no real grounds for complaint as to his treatment (excepting the theft of the sweetmeat, which he may not have dis covered till later).

From—-M ajor A. P. Trevor, First Assistant Resident in charge of Residency To— Sardar Saiyid Khan of Geh. After compliments.—-You will remember that in July last the Resident, Maior Cox addressed you on the subject of your movement to Bampur and matters connected with it. In reply to the Resident you assured the Resident that you would never do anything against the Shah and that if you could do anything to assist the Resident you would do so. I now write to inform you that I have heard that certain Afghan law-breakers and evil-doers propose to approach you in a short time to ask you for a district in which to settle in order to carry out their nefarious schemes. I am further informed that they intend to propose to you that in return for the concession to reside in Bint, they will assist you against the Persian Government. I do not know how much truth there is in these reports, but should these persons approach you, you will no doubt have nothing to do with them. To do so would be to act hostile to the Shah which you have assured the Resident you will never do. As a friend and well-wisher I earnestly warn you against offering any assistance to these arms smugglers which would bring upon you the wrath of the Persian Government and the High Government which you would have to meet unaided as these Afghans could never carry out any promises they made. To assist them therefore would be to bring very serious consequences on you. I also strongly advise you to remain loyal to the Persian Government. Accept assurance of my esteem. May you be preserved. Telegram, dated the 24th January 1910. From— Sardar Saiyid Khan of Geh, To—His Honour the Superintendent of the Telegraph in the part of Charbar. I beg to state that your letter was received through Kossid Sherwe and I was glad to hear of your health. I noted what you had written. You had given a detail about my services and the Government affairs. Of course the fact is not as has seemed to you. Prom the beginning of my life I have not attempted to act against the rule of the Government. I am a servant and a slave of the Government and am also a humble subject of theirs. Not only the Persian Government but the Kaiser-i-Hindustan which is your Government will, I believe, admit that no action has been taken in contravention of the rules in the districts of Mekran, Bahoo, Dashtiari and as far as Sirgan and Bir which are in my jurisdiction. You are aware of the situation of Baluchistan. (Three lines following the above are not clear.) When anarchy and chaos appeared in Persia the people of Sarhad, Sara wan jointly plundered considerable property and revenue from the countries of Seistan, Bam, Narmashir Jeiroft and Jemal Bariz, and they will afterwards intend to commit plunders ; but I will not be responsible on that account because the armalin (perhaps ahali, viz., people) and Sardars of those places were committing such actions in the time of Sultan Nasradin Shah and the matter has no connection with me. You had written a detail about the irregular action of the Afghan tribe. Although I know you are not thoroughly aware of this and do not know the passage of the Afghan caravan and you consider that the Afghan caravans have much connection and friendship with the people of Mekran, and (that) during their journey to Maskat they receive co-operation and assistance from them, but I tell you plainly (that) the Afghan caravans (laden) with woollen cloth always pass via Narmashir and Rodbar and go to Bunder Abbas where they sell their goods, and their camels return to Rodbar and they themselves generally come to the port of Maskat. Some of them also go to Maskat by the Karachi mail and return via Jask, Biyaban, Karoo Siiik and Koohistak. By my word the fact is I say and no one else will ever pass this s de. It is said that the Afghan caravan which came via Karachi, Bu ider Abbas and Maskat is composed of about one thousand or two thousand men. (Here there a few words which cannot be understood.) The Kafilaseem very small at first, but when tW i , from all parts with the knowledge of eaeh^th 16 laD ^ ^ ey colleeted together know further that this large numhfr of her and becamfi You Baluchis tribe and there had been no ilfwiLlw n0t Un&lt;ler the eontro1 of affairs cannot he regulated by me unless the r g ( a mongst them) and such will not refuse to perform oners’ an^rviL of TheT- ^? them - 1 Government of India) and to act unnn ^ ,?- aiser Hindustan (the what you may say.

Telegram, dated the 25th January 1910. From-MAJOE A. P. Trevor, Acting Consul-General, To —Sardar Saiyid Khan. After compliments.—I hare had the pleasure of receiving through the Superintendent Telegraphs, Charbar, your answer to my telegram of Xlth instant in which you express your loyalty to the Persian Government and friendship to the Kaiser-i-Hind I would point out that the message you received was from me the First Assistant in charge of the Residency, under instructions from the High Government. In that message I did not ask you to expel the Afghans but only to refrain from assisting Afghans who are cngHged m smuggling arms or from granting them any concession to reside in your district from which they can carry out their nefarious schemes. I again take the opportunity of warning you not to do either of these two things. I know well that many Afghans are engaged in legitimate trade and have known many personally at Bunder Abbas on the frontier of India. But they do not come in such large numbers and always go openly to Bunder Abbas which is the proper port. I am very pleased to receive the assurances contained in the last portion of your letter and can assure you that your best interests lie in maintaining your allegiance to the Persian Government and your friendship with the Kaiser-i- Hind. You will have heard that the Sirkar is now engaged in suppressing the arms traffic and I hope soon to hear that you are discouraging the Afghans who deal in the trade. The Resident, Major Cox, will return from leave in about 14 days. I trust you are in the enjoyment of good health and may you be preserved. Telegram, dated the 7th February 1910. From— Sardar Saiyid Khan, To—The Hon'ble Resident Saheb, Bushire. I beg to state that I have duly received your esteemed message and was pleased fur the kind regards which you had therein expressed, because I have spent my whole life for the exalted Persian Government and the High British Government and have not at all done any perfidy and offence, and no offence will be done by me at this end of my life, against the Persian Government. I will observe the same sense of duty which I have formerly had; and further more, I have a sincere devotion and a special obedience to the British Govern ment. As to the proceedings of the Afghans and Khalifa Khair Muhammad, I have sent a special messenger to Mulla Khair Muhammad (stating) that he should give up such proceedings and also leave the Baluch soil. I also collected 2,000 men and punished Islam Khan, who was taking certain proceedings and came to Geh from Panoch with the forces and troops which I have and seized the persons who committed offence against your Government and made a proper arrange ment for telegraphs and have reported all my objects via Charbar and am pre pared to render services to the two Governments. Should you yourself have any services for me, please write.28 40 No. 479, dated Bushire, the 18th (received SZed) February 1 10 Confidential). From—M ajoe A. P. Trevor, Pint Assistant Resident, in ch rge o£ Residency, To-The Secretary to the Government of India in the For ign Depertment. In view of the measures Government have been taking to suppress the arms traffic on the Mekran Coast, I recently asked the Political Agent, Bahrein, to riVe me a brief report on the present state of the traffic in that island I now have the honour to forward, for the information of the Government of India, ,iav a copy of the Political Agent s letter ou r f, 0; First toUMt the subject. Major Prideaux’s letter Evident in oh»ge. ' No. 517, dated 24th November 1906, to which Captain Mackenzie alludes, was forwarded to Government under cover of Major Cox’s letter No. 2798, dated 2nd December 1906. 2. It will he seen from Captain Mackenzie’s letter that the traffic in Bahrein has dwindled down to very small dimensions. Also the capture of the dhow “ Khairi ” with arms for Katr shows that arms for that part are no longer smuggled through from Bahrein, in fact as Captain Mackenzie mentions, the reverse process is in favour and arms are smuggled across from Katr. 3. Captain Mackenzie asks for instructions as to how far he can press the Sheikh to search for and seize arms in the island. As mentioned in my telegram* No. 123, dated 6th Pehruary 1910 Sheikh Esa recently asked tor a permit • semi No. 150 , Part n. import 20+ rifles and 4,000 rounds of + Number given as 40 rifles and 2,000 rounds in the ammunition from Maskat. It is obvioUS telegram by a clerical error. re g ar( J s the prohibition 8S binding, and I would suggest that if the Government of India see no objection, Captain Mackenzie may be authorised to press the Sheikh to seize modern arms which may be illegally imported into the island in the future. The Sheikh might be asked to call upon all persons having arms in the island to produce them before one of his officers and have them stamped with a mark, and notify that in future all arms must be imported by license and stamped and that arms not so stamped will be liable to confiscation. 4. In regard to the question of old muzzle-loaders, &amp;c., to which Captain Mackenzie refers in paragraph 5 of his letter, I think that we can only advise the Sheikh that in the interests of the public peace it would be highly desirable to place some restriction on the sale of such weapons. The Sheikh might perhaps consider the idea of issuing licenses to carry such weapons at a small fee. It seems to me, however, that the questi m of these muzzle old-fashioned loading weapons is not one in which we need interfere at present. 5. There is no doubt that a certain number of rifles are smuggled oyer from Bahrein to Persia, along with tea and other highly taxed commodities. Roughly speaking, the Persian coast seems to be divided into zones for smug gling purposes. Debai supplies the coast for some distance on each side of Lingah and also the Shib Kuh ports; Bahrein, Tangistan and Dashtistan; and Koweit, Bunder Rig, Rudhilla and the coast from Bushire up to the Shatt-el- Arab. Of course cargoes are taken into better zones occasionally when the market is specially good, but my enquiries show that the zones are generally adhered to chiefly on account of prox imity to the port of departure. The smuggling dhows can run arms from the three ports to places in their respective zones very quickly and the prevailing w inds up or down Gulf are favourable. The gun market in the Bah rein zone is not so good as in the others, as the Tangistani Chiefs and others import direct from Maskat. It is possible, how ever, that our seizures of Tangistani dhows, &amp;c., may result in a recrudescence of trade via Bahrein unle ss we take steps to stop it. 6. I therefore beg to request that the Government of India will be pleased to favour me with the instructions they desire to he given to the Political Agent, Bahrein, in respect of the questions raised in paragraphs 4 and 5 of his letter seat herewith.No. 62, date! the 5th February 1910. From— Captain C. F. Mackenzie, Political Agent, Bahrein, To Major A. P. Trevor, lirst Assistant Resident in charge of Residency* Bushire. I have the honour to refer to Major Prideaux’s letter No. 517, dated the 24th November 1906, and to state that the syndicate of arms dealers referred to in paragr&amp;ph 4 thereof appear to have dwindled in numbers to Yusuf bu Pakhru, resident in Muharrak, and Ali bin Alusa Holi, who is temporarily residing in Maskat, although it is stated Sheikh Hamad bin Esa has taken a certain amount of profits as a type of blackmail. 2. It was rumoured that one of the booms captured in the early part of December, ard about the capture of which Saiyid Faisal is said to have written to the Political Agent, Maskat, contained 118 rifles belonging to Ali bin Musa, and 130 rifles belonging to Salih bin Mana of Katr and other guns hi longing to two importers of Katr whose names are not known. 3. The usual method of bringing the arms is to carry a few at a time with ordinary cargo of boats sailing from Maskat to Katr, and then they are transferred and brought to Bahrein and probably Koweit in the same manner. The number introduced into Bahrein is estimated at about 1,500 rifles per annum, and I think the majority of these find their way back to the Arab coast, but no doubt some 20 per cent go over to the Persian side. 4 . If I can be given instructions as to how far 1 may press Sheikh Esa to co-operate with me in discovering and attaching arms, I hope to be able to put an end to the traffic in Bahrein itself. 5 . The question of muzzle-loading country-made guns may at the same time receive attention. At present it is generally recognised that there is no pro hibition against such weapons, and they are more or less openly carried. Such free license constitutes a danger to the community, and during my absence a Tuwir, unRWt, was shot hv another with one of these guns.

It is reported that the arms are sent from the Katr Peninsula. A launch has been despatched to Basidu and on the 23rd February a ship will proceed to that place in order to watch the coast between Kishm and Sheik Shuaih island. Measures have been adopted to provide against the entrance to the Clarence Strait of any more arms dhows.

There is now no immediate risk of reprisals on the part of Afghans, since most of them have moved away from the district on the coast. Such arms and ammnnition as have been landed have been carried inland where we cannot reach them. The minor Chiefs as well as the inhabitants on the coast are all of them impressed with our ability to punish them if they give us cause for offence. A decidedly strong effect has been produced by the troops embarked on the R. I. M. S. “ Hardinge” and this effect is not confined to the coast, but extends a good distance inland I am of opinion that the expense of further retaining the “ Hardinge” in the Persian Gulf is not justified and I propose that she should return on the 7th March to Bombay and disembark the troops. I would, however, suggest that the “ Hardinge ” he not dismantled, hut that she be kept ready in case the necessity arises for re-employing her. Also that the troops be warned to he in readiness to embark on short notice. Should the “ Hardinge ” be required again she could he back in the Persian Gulf within six days and this would meet all require ments. I propose the retention at their present strength of the garrisons at Jask and Charbar. I am sending a letter in explanation of my views. I intend to return to Bombay on the 28th February so as to meet Major Cox who will then be proceeding to Calcutta.

The arrangement n S • Seem t0 necessita te implied guarantee of Sultan against French, namly dmermg from explicit guarantee for which he has asked, in return for restrictions on import trade. If a guarantee is decided on, Sultan would probably ave to agree, hut the arrangement would mean practical extinction of arms tramc revenue, and he would therefore have the same claim' for compensation as for suppression of import trade. Effective restrictions on export would, therefore, seem to involve nearly as much friction with France and nearly as great expense as the restrictions on imports while the result would not be nearly so satisfactory. Best course for restrictions on import trade, in my opinion, is either by amicable arrangement with France or in spite of treaty with her. It might be necessary, if friction with France is undesirable, to fall back on restrictions on export under the proclamation of 1898 only, hut not unless other course is impracticable. I regret it is difficult for me to offer, within the limits of a telegram, useful opinion on a complicated subject of this nature.

IN connection with arrangements for the suppression of the arms traffic in the Persian Gulf it is considered desirable to prevent Afghans from reaching Muscat. At the request of the Government of India the British India Steam Navigation Company have discontinued booking Afghans to that port. Would it he possible to approach Bombay Persia Steam Navigation Company with a view to inducing them to take a similar step P If there is any reasonable prospect of success, and if his Excellency the Governor sees no objection, the Government of India would he glad if an attempt be made. The reason which may he given is that the Sultan of Muscat has prohibited the residence of Afghans in his country, and that the Government of India regard with disfavour the visits of these people to Muscat.

A BEPOET received by me from Bae states that he has discovered Sepoy Ghulam Muhammad fNo. 3052) in possession of a Mauser pistol, and has a strong case against him under section 19 of the Arms Act of abetting imports of arms into India. It appears that Jemadar Mala Khan, of his regiment, the 129th Duke ot Connaught’s Own Baluchis, at Kurrachee, is also implicated. Details have not yet been received by me, and it is possible that Ghulam Muhammad may be acting without the knowledge of his comrades, but it seems most desirable, in the circum stances mentioned in your telegram dated the lith December, to have a fresh detach ment, composed of sepoys who are not likely to engage in this traffic. I therefore suggest that the arrangements mentioned in my letter dated the 19th September should be brought into force forthwith, and the detachment at Bunder Abbas relieved at once by a detachment from the regiment supplying other detach ments in the Gulf. In view of present circumstances, and the fact that the senior naval officer cannot, without detriment to the blockade, spare a ship to visit Bunder Abbas periodically. I would further suggest that the detachment be raised to one native officer and thirty men, to be reduced, when the Afghans have left, to the present scale. The case against Ghulam Muhammad and the Jemadar could he enquired into at Kurrachee by the civil and military authorities as may he deemed fit by Government. Enclosure 6 in No. 1.

Erom my own experience I am inclined to agree, but I think that it would be better to avoid all chance of attack, and strengthen detachment as suggested. Dae also suggests that Mahommedans may be sent if the proposed detachment is sanctioned. I am, however, of opinion that the detachment should be on the same footing as others in the Gulf, and that, with the exception of frontier tribesmen, any class of sepoy may be sent. If sanction is not accorded to my proposal, I would beg to request that the officer commanding 129th Duke of Connaught’s Own Baluchis may he directed to send, in direct communication with the British consul at Bunder Abbas, relief for Sepoy Ghulam Muhammad and escort to conduct latter back. (Telegraphic.) PLEASE Enclosure 9 in No. 1. Naval Commander-in-Chief, East Indies Squadron, to Government of India. (Secret.) Bombay, December 28, 1909. BE pleased to lay before his Excellency the \iceroy and Governor-General of India in Council the annexed letter addressed to the Admiralty upon the general situation with regard to the traffic in arms in the Persian Gulf. 2. Since writing this letter I have received information that the arms traders are already beginning to run arms to points in Baluchistan, for a cargo of 1,500 rifles is reported to have been landed some 30 miles to the eastward of the frontier last week or the week before. 3. It will he difficult to extend the operations of the ships engaged on the blockade much to the eastward without further reinforcements, but I think that a great deal may he done to assist naval action by bringing pressure to bear upon the various tribes and villages on the coast, so as to make them realise that it is not to their advantage to assist the arms runners. It appears probable a i w ou e costly and not at all easy to patrol the coast by troops, and in view of the possible concentration of considerable bodies of Afghans, a large numoei o men r\ou Je required. I would point out, however, that the operation cou 1 , 0 ,fa? fi, nv p much more effectively carried out from the sea with e loops or , • , already asked. The effect produced by landing a force without ' va ™'?= , and punishing a village for disobedience of instructions, and f e “ “f many miles away and acting in a similar manner theie, pro a tas(j jji day, will so impress the coast villagers with a feeling y ,j |er misbehaviour, that it is highly probable that they wn pie 61 the villages within than to harbour the arms runners. In my opinion, if we caa 10 miles or so of the coast that they can be reached with a moment and without any warning, it will go far to keep a eangs of the littoral, in which the arms traders will find ^“^Tthke of wWchttfey instead of, as at present, being able to obtain every kin' CO niunction are in need.

Enclosure 10 in No. 1. Rear-Admiral Slade to Admiralty. (Confidential.) Zt ^ lr ’ BE pleased to lay before tbe Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty the following general report on the operations which are being earned on m the Persian Gulf foAhe suppression of the arms traffic. 2 The ships that are actually employed on tins service at the present moment are the “ Box,” senior officer’s ship, “ Perseus ” “ Philomel ” and “ Lapwing. ’ These vessels have orders to send away as many boats as possible to watch the landing places in shore while the ships cruise in the offing. The boats ordinarily away cruising are as follows :— &lt;c Eox ” six, including the &lt;4 JV ^ himbrel, ,, a sailing cutter lent by the Boyal Indian ’ Marine (see East Indies letter of the 18th December, 1909). “Perseus,” three. “ Philomel,” three. “ Lapwing,” one. 3 . The attached chart* shows the various points on the coast at which arms and ammunition have been landed during the last twelve months, of which the more important places are the following :— Place— Galang . Khunarak Ras Bris . Pwihsk Bunji Gunari No. on Chart. 7 4 . Owing to the different conditions which exist east and west of Jask, the method of watching the coast varies in a few details, hut the principle on which the blockade is conducted is to make the landing places unsafe, by maintaining a close watch with as many boats as are available and to keep the ships cruising in the offing. Should a dhow* be nearing a landing place and receive signals from the shore that the coast is not clear, she has then to endeavour to reach another^ landing place or to seek shelter in one of the numerous bays in Oman territory, and it is then that the cruisers have a chance of overhauling and securing her. 5. Erom the 15th September to the 22nd November two ships were employed on this service, from 23rd November to 15th December three, and from 16th December to the present date four have been so employed, and, as far as I know, no large /■» 1 • i • '1 T 1 T 'I A .-V-WT'W* I'X/'V'M I I 'l cargoes of arms and ammunition have been landed since 24th November. The captures have been few, but they represent by far the larger proportion of rifles that have left Oman territory. The object is to stop the trade in arms, and except in so far as captures prevent the rifles from passing, a capture is only a detail in the whole scheme. It is not by the number of prizes that the success or otherwise of the operations must be judged, but by the result on the trade in general, and it is probable that very few more captures will be made this season. 6 . Up to the present the result of the operations on the trade is to completely dislocate everything. Dhows which had been loading are discharging their cargoes, and dhows which had sailed are returning and discharging. Freight is said to have increased from 1*6 rupees a rifle to 5 rupees, a rise of nearly 400 per cent., and it is reported that even at this figure Persian dhows will not take any cargoes at all. As I pointed out in my previous letters on the subject, the principal factor in this trade is the freight, and since every rifle and every box of ammunition must pass across the gulf by boat, if we can make that charge prohibitive the trade must cease. On several occasions a dhow, when captured, has sunk from one cause or another, and this has had the effect of putting up the prices more than anything else, and as long as the dhow-owners think that a capture means the loss of everything to them, so long will the freights remain at a prohibitive price. * Not reproduced.\ 7. Besides the naval operations the Government of India have instituted a strict search for and arrest of all Afghans or Afridis who are going to Muscat with the intention of buying arms. This has had an excellent effect, as most of those who were going over had started for the coast via Kurachee and the Indian ports, not expecting any difficulties, and now it is too late in the season to alter their plans and go by Persian ports.^ This has completely upset all their arrangements, and it is probable that they will not be able to make any purchases this season. 8 . The effect on the arms traders in Muscat is to cause them very serious loss, not only on account of the arms and ammunition that have been captured or jettisoned, but also on account of the large stocks which they have accumulated and which are now lying idle on their hands. 9. This paralysis of the trade must he looked upon as only temporary, and unless we maintain our watch without intermission for some considerable period of time, the trade will break out again with renewed vigour. If the traders were given a chance, they would immediately take advantage of it and send every rifle and box of ammunition for sale in Muscat to the Persian Coast as quickly as possible, and we should he in just as had a situation as before. It is therefore necessary to maintain our blockade in full strength, although the trade has ceased for the present, and it will only be possible to relax it after the caravan season has passed, probably about the end of April. Even then we shall find it necessary to maintain a close watch on the coast, hut I hope to he able to withdraw a certain number of ships. 10. The trade is so lucrative and there is so much money embarked in it, that it must he expected that the traders will attempt to find some other means by which to carry it on, but since the arms and ammunition must he passed across the sea and smuggled into Persian territory, we have the control of it in our hands if we keep sufficient force on the spot and are prepared to act. 11 . The following appear to be the possible lines of development: (a.) To attempt to land the arms in Beluchistan east of Gwatar, and smuggle them through British territory into Afghanistan. t (6) To send the arms by dhow to open ports in the Gulf, such as Katr and other places in Turkish territory, and ship them thence to the Persian Coast. (c.) To form a depot in a port which is now free, export them thence as is now- done from Muscat, and abandon the Muscat depot altogether. This is a development of (f)') (d,) To ship the arms with false papers made out to some open port, and to divert the dhows to the Persian Coast when clear of Mussandin. . , (e.) Eor the European firms interested in the traffic to purchase dhows, register them, and run them under their own national flags, or to employ exis ^mic an Italian dhows. It is believed that all Mijjarten dhows now fly the Italian fla 3 a d many of them trade regularly in the Gulf for dates. -.i (/•) For the steamers bringing the arms from Europe to meet the dhows high seas, discharge the arms into them, and leave them to make the way to the coast. 12 In order to deal with (a) and also to comply with the request of the Government of India to arrest all Afghans who attempt to rea&lt; * ^ usc ^ ^^all I have arranged that ships on passage between Bombay an /J^ e , ^ pr i ce dhows met This will induce a feeling of insecurity and will tend to keep me price TteeigM at a high rate. If this form of evasion ^“rm”pass Zug'h necessary to extend the operations further e “f &gt; ' t dea i w i t h the situation our own territory the Government of India should be able to ueu without very much assistance from the navy. l f i the adoption of the 13.

With regard to {b), in which the possibility is suggested of steam ships direct from Europe engaging in this traffic, I would submit that telegraphic information may be furnished of the movements of any vessel leaving European ports with arms and ammunition for the Persian Gulf, in order that a watch on her movements may be kept. I would suggest that the Foreign Office may be requested to instruct the consuls at Marseilles and Port Said to inform the commander-in-chief on this station by telegraph when such ships leave their respective ports. The conditions produced bv the Adoption of the alternatives (e) and (/) will introduce a totally new factor into the case, and I do not see any way of dealing with it satisfactorily, but by declaring a blockade of the coast affected. The international difficulties may he very great, because a blockade of a neutral coast will be established in order to prevent munitions of war from reaching an inland State with which w r e are not actually at war. It will be extending the principles upon which we acted during the South African war, in blockading Eoren^o Marques, to that of a so-called “ Pacific Blockade” of neutral coasts in time of peace. 16. Articles 30 and 36 of the declarations concerning contraband in time of war which was signed at the International Naval Conference of London in February 1909, clearly recognise the right to seize contraband of war when bound tor an enemy s country, even although that country has not a seaboard. If therefore the Government is forced to adopt this form of action, it is improbable that either France or Germany will be able to object to our proceedings, as I believe that both have accepted the Convention as it was drawn up. It would not require much stretching of words to describe the condition on the Indian frontier as a state of armed peace, which only awaits the supply of the very arms which we are endeavouring to stop to be turned into a state of war. 17. Assuming that the blockade is impracticable, the only course of action open to us will be to seize vessels discharging arms and ammunition in Persian or British waters, whatever their character or nationality. As I understand the position of His Majesty’s ships engaged in this service, they are empowered to seize vessels in Persian waters under the authority of an agreement with the Persian Government dated the 18th December, 1897. But as a copy of this agreement is not in my office (a copy was demanded by East Indies letter of the 4th November, 1909), I am uncertain whether this interpretation is correct, and I shall be glad to receive their Lordships’ directions on the subject. Should the vessel implicated be flying a foreign flag she will accordingly only be dealt with in Persian or British waters. Should she be discovered when contravening the law in territorial waters, and escaped to the high seas before she has been actually captured, she will be chased and seized, and I hold that the capture will be good. With regard to British waters, I am of opinion that a vessel can be seized when acting in contravention of the law of India, which forbids the importation of all arms and ammunition. The vessels so captured would be takea to the nearest port to be dealt with by the civil power. 18. It will be far more difficult to make the watch effective under these conditions than it is at present, and it may be necessary to ask for further reinforcements if we are driven to take this line of action. I should not anticipate international complica tion, except perhaps on the right of British vessels to seize foreign vessels on behalf of the Persian Government. I think that questions of fact as to the position of the vessels at the moment of capture should form the subject of investigation before a properly constituted prize court. 19. If Persia will not or cannot act up to her engagements and stop the importa tion of arms and the passage through her territory of caravans taking arms to the tribes on our frontiers, it may be claimed that we have a legitimate cause of complaint against her. Also if she does not stop the Afghans who come down to the coast to receive these arms from firing on our ships and boats, it may be claimed that she has forfeited the right to expect any consideration from us, and that we are justified in taking steps to defend our own interests by blockading the coasts. This line of action will raise a different series of international difficulties, but, if the Government decides (U[ appear to be necessary to make a choice between one 20. I would further draw their Lordships’ attention to the action of the Afghans nn rp.rsia.n t,pm row ji , . „ . . ships’ boats when they are within range of the beach. It is quite^possible that an attack may be made m force on either Jask or Charbar, or both, and steps have been taken to put both these places in as good a state of defence as practicable. This all points to the necessity of haying a military force at hand that I can move rapidly to either station if it is threatened, with the object of inflicting a severe lesson on the Afghans if they attempt an attack, the fact that they have opened fire on ships’ boats and are apparently organising attacks on our stations from Persian territory, without let or hindrance from the Persian Government, would seem to absolve ns from all obligations to respect that territory should an opportunity occur to make an effective counter-stroke. 1.

It will be noticed that His Highness in reply to my request for the arrest of Afghans found in Muscat states that there are none in the neighbourhood at present According to my information, however, there are at least twenty Afghans in Muscat and Mutrah, and the Sultan’s inaction is another proof of his unwillingness to assist our efforts in any way. I learn that His Highness has warned arms merchants to instruct all Afghans coming here to disguise themselves carefully in order to avoid possibilities of trouble. 3. The arms trade is still in a state of collapse owing to the blows which have been dealt, but there are several consignments ready for shipment when a favourable opportunity arrives. I am informed that merchants who get their supplies of arms from German firms have submitted a petition to the German Government complaining against the recent action of His Majesty’s ships. I have, however, as yet received no confirmation of this report. 4.

IN accordance with your signal of the 7th December, 1909, I beg to report that the circumstances attending the capture of 17 rifles and 1,600 rounds of ammunition in a badan off Kuriyat on the morning of the 5th December were as follows :— After leaving Kuriyat I steamed out to sea towards a dhow I had sighted previously. On closing her I stopped and lowered the whaler and sent Lieutenant Samson to board her. The position of the dhow was then by cross bearings— Kuriyat Islet, south 32° west. Kuriyat Peak, south 48° west. Pas Abu Baud Islet, south 87° west. Lieutenant Samson afterwards reported to me that when he boarded the dhow the crew behaved in a truculent manner, so he disarmed them of their daggers, and as he saw rifles in the boat he took her in tow and brought her alongside the ship, where she was searched. The cargo was shifted, with the result that 17 rifles and 1,600 rounds of ammuni tion were discovered ; 7 of these rifles were absolutely new and 10 were old. At the time of searching no explanation was offered why the rifles were there, although some of the men were wearing bandoliers, and they might have owned the older rifles. At the time of boarding the wind was from the north-west and the dhow was heading about east-north-east. She was old, and, in my opinion, would not have towed any distance without being swamped, so I let her go. Before she shoved off the whaler had been hoisted with the daggers still in her. This I did not know of until afterwards, and as there were some more dhows in sight I did not think it advisable to give up the opportunity of searching these craft so that I mi ght return the daggers to their owners. A list of gear taken out of the badan is attached. This was all mustered soon after she had shoved off, and has now all been returned to the Sultan through the political agent at Muscat, and the enclosed list signed as a receipt. ... I regret that this error in judgment on my part was committed, but, m justice to myself, I would beg to submit that the new rifles, position and course of dhow, direction of the wind, and the bearing of her supposed destination (Sur) all assisted in making me decide to confiscate her arms.

I BEG to inform you that, on the morning of the 21st Zulkaad, 1327 (5th Decem ber, 1909), the Government man-of-war arrived here and sent off a boat to the shore and examined all the badans of Kuriyat which were in the “khor” (bay). They seized one rifle and daggers from one badan belonging to the people of Fins. Also a badan belonging to Sheikh Muhammad-bin-Shamas Sheaibi was near Ras Bu Dawood. They went for it, and came over them and seized all the arms in the boat belonging to the passengers, as well as of the askaris who were going to Sur, and of all. And the askaris of Akid (Jemadar) Ahmed-bin-Abdullah were also among them. The money being the pay of the askaris was also seized. And now your slave, Muhammad-bin-and^daamf ^ ^ returned to y° u and y° u are tlieir master; HAMUD-bin-NASIR-bin-MUHAMMAD. P.S.

To our friend Consul Mr. Holland : (After compliments.) Please see the contents of this letter. Have the men-of-war received any orders to act in this way ? I am awaiting a reply. I am afraid for the consequences of these actions. FAISAL. Enclosure 5 in No. 1. Mr. Holland to the Sultan of Muscat. (After compliments.) Muscat, 2Mh Zulkaad, 1327 (December 8, 1909). I HAVE made enquiries regarding the complaint made to your Highness by the Vali of Kuriyat on the subject of the seizure of rifles and daggers from a Kuriyat badan. I find it is true that the articles mentioned in the enclosed list were seized. The captain of the man-of-war took them because the men had seven new rifles, and he therefore suspected that they were going to take them to the Mekran coast. But from the Vali’s letter it appears that the arms belonged to askaris and passengers, and were not being taken for smuggling. They were therefore seized by mistake, and I am sorry that this should have occurred to give trouble to your Highness. Your Highness knows that it is not our wish to trouble your Highness’s subjects, but only to prevent the smuggling of arms to the Indian frontier. If your Highness will send over someone to take the articles I shall have much pleasure in handing them over. The askaris told the Vali that money was seized, but this is not true. The 1 st lieutenant was in the boat all the time, and no money was taken. .Accept, &amp;c. R. E. HOLLAND, Political Agent, and His Britannic Majesty s Consul, Muscat. Enclosure 6 in No. 1.

I have made further enquiries from the captain of “ Philomel,” and I can assure your Highness that there was no mistake in what I told your Highness in my last letter, namely, that the articles handed over by me to your Highness’s servant were all that were seized, and nothing else whatever was taken. It is impossible that the captain of the ship or I myself should tell your Highness what is not true with regard to this. It is certain that not a single pie of money was taken from the ship, and all other articles taken were duly handed back. Accept, &amp;c. R. E.

However desirable it might be that the Persian Government should be induced to forego its rights in order to strengthen our representations to the Sultan of Maskat, it does not appear to me that the present method of dealing with arms, &amp;c., seized within Persian jurisdiction, is in itself likely to militate against effective working of the proposed blockade. I fear that the argument that the desired concession on the part of Persia would strengthen our case with Maskat would not carry much weight with the Mejlis, and I have little hope that I could induce the Persian Government to consent to any step which could he interpreted as a further surrender of their sovereign rights. The question would be submitted to the Mejlis and a discussion would be provoked in which those who opposed our representations would have the encouragement of any foreign legation desirous of hampering us.

From— Major A. P. Trevor, In charge of the duties of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Foreign Department, Calcutta. A report received by me from Rae states that he has discovered Sepoy Ghulam Muhammad (Number 3052) in possession of a Mauser pistol and has a strong case against him under section 19 of the Ar ms Act of abetting93 imports of arms into India. It appears that Jemadar Mala Khan of his regiment, the 129th Duke of Connaught’s Own Baluchis, at Karachi, is also implicated. Details have not yet been received by me and it is possible that Ghulam Muhammad may be acting without the knowledge of his comrades, but it seems most desirable, in the circumstances mentioned in your telegram No. S.—477, dated 17th December, to have a fresh detachment com posed of sepoys who are not likely to engage in this traffic. I would therefore suggest that the arrangements mentioned in my letter No. 2384, dated the 19th September, should be brought into force forthwith, and the detachment at Bunder Abbas relieved at once by a detachment from the regiment supplying other detachnents in the Gulf. In view of present circumstances, and the fact that the Senior Naval Officer cannot, without detriment to the blockade, spare a ship to visit Bunder Abbas periodically, I would further suggest that the detachment be raised to one native officer and 30 men, to be reduced, when the Afghans have left, to the present scale.

Be pleased to lay before His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General f India m Council the annexed letter addressed to the Admiralty upon the eneral situation with regard to the traffic in arms m the Persian Gulf. 2 Since writing this letter I have received information that the arms •aders are already beginning to run arms to points in Baluchistan, for cargo of 1,500 rifles is reported to have been landed some 30 miles to the astward of the frontier last week or the week before. 3. It will be difficult to extend the operations of the ships engaged on the lockade much to the eastward without farther reinforcements, hut I thi hat a great deal may he done to assist Naval action by ^ iear upon the various tribes and villages on the coast so as to “em ealiseVat it is not to their advantage ^ Xl t he LaTby “»uid j , ; j», “V,r d . h “r h i 3 iffectivelyearnedoutfromBie sea force ^ itbout naming of any dready asked.

This cannot be done with the ships alone, but, working in conjunction with a military force, the power that can be exerted will be enormously increased. 4 The question of fu-ther reinforcing Jask and Charbar to which reference is made in the Secretary of State’s telegram to His Excellency the , Viceroy, dated 20th December 1909, need not be further considered at time, provided that the transport with troops on board be authorised. If Afghans divide their forces and attack Jask and Charbar simultaneously garrisons of those places will probably be able to provide for their safety, if they concentrate on one or other of these stations, then if the transport ...... been provided, we sh«ll have a large reinforcement which we shall be able to use for the relief of the point attacked within 24 hours. 5 . I would also point out that it is most important that at least some of the launches that are to be provided should be ready as soon as possible, in order to deal with the new conditions which are evidently arising. The naval crews for four of these craft will arrive at Bombay from England on the 14th January next, and a crew for another launch can be temporarily furnished from my Flagship. this the the but has (Confidential). Traffic in arms in the Fersian Gulf— General Report. Commander-in-Chief’s Olfiee, Bombay; 24th December 1909. No. 1049-1462 XIV. f /c Sir, Be pleased to lay before the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty the following^general report on the operations which are being carried on in the Persian Gulf for the suppression of the arms traffic. 2. The ships that are actually employed on this service at the present moment are the “Fox”, Senior Officer’s Ship, “Perseus”, “Philomel” and “ Lapwing ”. These vessels have orders to send away as many boats as possible to watch the landing places in shore while the ships cruise in the offing. The boats ordinarily away cruising are as follows:— “ Fox ”, six, including the “ Whimbrel”, a sailing cutter lent by the Royal Indian Marine (see East Indies letter No. 1035-1462 XIV of ..8th December 1909). “ Perseus”, three. “Philomel”, three. “ Lapwing”, one. % 3. The attached chart shows the various points on the coast at which arms and ammunition have been landed during the last 12 months, of which the more important places are the following :— Place. Number on chart. Galag ... 7 Khunarak ... ... 9 Fas Bris ... ... 2 Pwihsk . . . ... ... lUa. Bunji • •• ... ... 16 Gunari . . . ... ... ... 18 4. Owing to the different conditions which exist east and west of Jask, the method of watching the coast varies in a few details, but the principle on which the blockade is conducted is to make the landing places unsafe, by maintaining a close watch with as many boats as are available and to keep the ships cruising in the offing. Should a dhow be nearing a landing place and receive signals from the shore that the coast is not clear, she has then to endeavour to reach another landing place or to seek shelter in one of theee of overhauling and securing her ' ° rm8erS ^ a 5. From the 15th Sftnfpmhot* xr i j * . captures will be made this season. i i. ?' to tbe P resent tbe result of the operations on the trade is to com pletely dislocate everything. Dhows which had been loading are discharging their cargoes, and dhows which had sailed are returning and discharging. Freight is said to have increased from Rs. 1-6 a rifle to Rs. 5, a rise of nearly 4*00/, and it is reported that even at this figure Persian dhows will not take any cargoes at all. As I pointed out in my previous letters on the subject, the principal factor in this trade is the Ireight, and since every rifle and every box of ammunition must pass across the Gulf by boat, if we can make that charge prohibitive the trade must cease. On several occasions a dhow,when captured, has sunk from one cause or another, and this has had the effect of putting up the prices more than anything else, and as long as the dhow-owners think that a capture means the loss of everything to them, so long will the freights remain at a prohibitive price. 7. Besides the naval operations, the Government of India have insti’ tuted a strict search for and arrest of all Afghans or Afridis who are going t° Maskat with the intention of buying arms. This has had an excellent effect, as most of those who were going over had started for the coast via Karachi and the Indian Ports, not expecting any difficulties, and now it is too late in the season to alter their plans and go by Persian ports. This has completely upset all their arrangements, and it is probable that they will not he able to make any purchases this season. 8. The effect on the arms traders in Maskat is to cause them very serious loss, not only on account of the arms and ammunition that have been captured or jettisoned, bnt also on account of the large stocks which they have accumu lated and which are now lying idle on their hands. 9. This paralysis of the trade must be looked upon as only temporary, and unless we maintain our watch without intermission for some considerable | period of time, the trade will break out again with renewed vigour. If the traders were given a chance, they would immediately take advantage of it and send every rifle and box of ammunition for sale in Maskat to the Persian Coast as quickly as possible, and we should he in just as bad a situation as before. It is therefore necessary to maintain our blockade in full strength, although the trade has ceased for the present, and it will only he possible to relax it after the caravan season has passed, probably about the end of April. Even then we shall find it necessary to maintain a close watch on the coast, but I hope to be able to withdraw a certain number of ships. 10. The trade is so lucrative and there is so much money embarked in it, that it must be expected that the traders will attempt to find some other means by which to carry it on, but since the arms and ammunition must he passed across the sea and smuggled into Persian territory, we have the control of it in our hands if we keep sufficient force on the spot and are prepared to act. 11. The following appear to be the possible lines of development:— (a) To attempt to land the arms in Baluchistan east of Gwatar, and smuggle them through British territory into Afghanistan.■ 98 To send the arms by dhow to open ports in the Gulf, such as Katr and other places in Turkish territory, and ship them thence to the Persian coast. To form a dep6t in a port which is now free, export them thence as is now done from Maskat, and abandon the Maskat dep6t altogether. This is a development of (b). (d) To ship the arms with false papers made out to some open port, and to divert the dhows to the Persian coast when clear of Mussandin. (e) For the European firms interested in the traffic to purchase dhows, register them, and run them under their own national flags, or to employ existing French and Italian dhows. It is believed that all Mijjarten dhows now fly the Italian Flag and many of them trade regularly in the Gulf for dates. , (/) For the steamers bringing the arms from Europe to meet the dhows on the hi-h seas, discharge the arms into them, and leave them to make the best of their way to the coast. 12. In order to deal with {a) and also to comply with the request of the Government of India to arrest all Afghans who attempt to reach Maskat by dhow, I have arranged that ships on passage between Bombay and the Gulf shall search all dhows met. This will induce a feeling of insecurity and will tend to keep the price of freight at a high rate. If this form of evasion becomes serious, it may be necessary to extend the operations further east, but since the arms will pass through our own territory the Government of India should be able to deal with the situation without very much assistance from the Navy. 13. The conditions that would be brought about by the adoption of the alternatives (6), (c) and (d) will be more difficult to deal with, and in order to do so it may be necessary to shift the whole scheme of blockaae The same general principle would be the most efiective one, but it might take time to develop, as we should have to find out the points at which the arms would be landed. It is improbable that places would be selected much to the west of Lingah, on account of the the difficulties of land transport, and even if arms were landed in that vicinity, the sea journey would be so much longer that it ought to be practicable to deal with each case satisfactorily. Each case in which a dhow is met before arrival at the port for which she is nominally bound will have to be dealt with on its merits and the principle to be followed will be little different from that which was applied to similar cases which arose during the prolonged blockades of the French and German coasts during the Napoleonic wars. 14. As pointed out in paragraphs 6 and 10, the most effective way to stop the trade is to make the penalties that will fall on the dhow owners so heavy that the freight will become prohibitive, and therefore I propose that a dhow should not be released under any circumstances when she is found with arms on board, unless a clear case is made out that she was acting within her jegal rights. 15. With regard to (6), in which the possibility is suggested of steam ships direct from Europe engaging in this traTc, I would submit that telegraphic informatio n may be furnished of the movements of any vessel leaving European ports with arms and ammunition for the Persian Gulf, in order that a watch on her movements may be kept. I would suggest that the Foreign Office may be requested to instruct the Consuls at Marseilles and Port Said to inform the Commander-in-Chief on this Station by telegraph when such ships leave their respective ports. The conditions produced by the adoption of the alternatives (&lt;?) and (/) will introduce a totally new factor into the case, and I do not see any way of dealing with its satisfactorily, but by declaring a blockade of the coast affected. The international difficulties may be very great, because a blockade of a neutral coast will be established in order to prevent munitions of war from reaching an inland state with which we are not actually at war. It wall be extending the principles upon which we acted during the South African War, in blockading Lourence Marques, to that of a so called “ Pacific Blockade ” of neutral coasts in time of peace.«; m »of' ro Artl v! eS i, 30an '? 3fi , ° f the concerning contraband in n Pebnmrv 7 qoO “§ ned at , the w^ational Naval Conference of London in Tebruary 1909, clearly recognise the right to seize contraband of war when “ ‘7 an 7 ne “y s ““'try. P/P' although that country has not a sea board” If therefore the Government is forced to adopt this form of action, it is impro bable that either trance or Germany will be able to object to our proceedings, as I believe that both have accepted the Convention as it was drawn up. It would not require much stretching of words to describe the condition on the Indian frontier as a state of armed peace, which only awaits the supplv of the very arms which we are endeavouring to stop to he turned into a state of war. 17. Assuming that the blockade is impracticable, the only course of action open to us will be to seize vessels discharging arms and ammunition in Persian or British waters, whatever their character or nationality. As I understand the position of His Majesty’s Ships engaged in this service, they are empowered to seize vessels in Persian waters under the authority of an agreement with the Persian Government dated 18 h December 1897. But as a copy of this agreement is not in my office '(a copy was demanded by East Indies letter No. 904—404 of 4th November 1909), I am uncertain whether this interpre tation is correct, and I shall be glad to receive their Lordships’ directions on the subject. Should the vessel implicated be flying a foreign flag she will accordingly only be dealt with in Persian or British waters. Should she be discovered when contravening the law in territorial w T aters and escaped to the high seas before she has been actually captured, she will be chased and seized, and I hold that the capture will be good. With regard to British waters, I am of opinion that a vejsel can be seized when acting in contravention of the law of India, which forbids the importation of all arms and ammunition. The vessels so captured would be taken to the nearest part to he dealt with by the civil power. 18. It will be far more difficult to make the watch effective under these conditions than it is at present, and it may be necessary to ask for further re-inforcements if we are driven to take this line of action. I should not anticipate international complication, except perhaps on the right of British vessels to seize foreign vessels on belalf of the Persian Government. I think that qnestions of fact as to the position of the vessels at the moment of capture should form the subject of investigation before a properly constituted Prize Court. 19. If Persia will not or cannot act up to her engagements and stop the importation of arms and the passage through her territory of caravans taking arm to the tribes on our frontiers, it may be claimed that we have a legitimate cause of complaint against her. Also if she does not stop the Afghans who come down to the coast to receive these arms from firing on our ships and boats, it may be claimed that she has forfeited the right to expect any consideration from us, and that we are justified in taking steps to defend our own interests by blockadin 0, the coasts. This line of action will raise a different senes of inter national difficulties, but, if the Government decides to establish a blockade, it would appear to be necessary to make a choice between one or other of the two alternatives. # 20. I would further draw Their Lordships’ attention to the action of the Afghans on Persian territory. Some hundreds are already there, and inform- ftion has been received that large bodies are on their way to the coast From a I can learn, these men are very exasperated at our action, and they have already begun to fire on the ships’ boats when they are withm range of the beach It is quite possible that an attack may be made in force on either Jask or Charbar, or both, and steps have been taken to put both these places in as good a State of defence as practicable. This all points to the necessity of having a military force at hand that 1 can move rapidly to either station if it is hreatened with the object of inflicting a severe lesson on the Afghans if they attempt an attack. The fact that they have opened fire on ships boats100 J .1 ~ ntfarks on our stations from Persian territory, are the Pei^an Government, would seem t/, absolve us'from all obligations to respect that territory should an opportunity occur to make an effective counter-stroke.

It is very undesirable to raise large general • Senai Nos. lei and 162. question either with Sultan of Maskat whose attitude is likely to he difficult or with the Persian Government who have so far made no claim under agreement to confiscated cargoes. It seems preferable to deal with each case as it arises on its merits. In the case of the dhow Badil and similar cases the Sultan of Maskat should be informed that we are prepared to give him the arms eventually, but that in the meantime they will be kept for him until we are satisfied that there is no chance of their returning to dealers. In the case of the dhow Khairi and similar cases the Sultan should be informed that his claim is untenable, and the cargo should be■ 101 destroyed. When a dhow is captured in M iskat waters and her papers are found to be m order, hut there are nevertheless good prim&amp; facie grounds for believ ing that she is engaged in illegitimate traffic she may be detained pending further enquiry, the Sultan being informed at once; if the result of the enquiry proves to he satisfactory, she must he released, if not satisfactory, the cargo may be retained for eventual restoration to the Sultan. Similar procedure should he followed with regard to Maskat dhows which are captured outside Maskat waters if circumstances make destruction unadvisable. In dealing with the Sultan it should be explained to him that it is not our intention to make him suffer pecuniarily. Would it not be possible to persuade Nejd Chief to prohibit the import of arms ? this would close the whole coast of Gulf outside Oman to the traffic. Question of the blockade is being considered with the utmost possible speed I presume that you are satisfied that the hire of launches is essential, if blockade is to inflict sufficient loss on traders to check trade. If not, this part of programme miL’ht be abandoned. Expenditure is very heavy. Meantime no mention should be made of Somaliland in connection with any possible movement of troops for Gulf blockade.

The proposal for the employment of these vessels should therefore be cancelled, but it is probable that a Royal Indian Marine ship will be very useful in connection with the blockade, and it is assumed that the Indian Government will lend her services if required. The Commander-in-Chief has requested that immediate steps may be taken to hire eight steam-launches, as proposed in paragraph 5 of Admiralty letter of the 2nd instant, as it appears that caravans will probably be collected earlier this year than 'formerly, and the busiest part of the season will now commence.

In the present case there is no clear indication of the nationality of the dhows, and the P Senior Naval Officer recommends the destruction of their cargoes for the sake of the moral effect that would he produced. There is no objection to their destruction on technical grounds, hut Lord Morley would propose that the serviceable portion of them should be retained, it being left to the discretion of the local authorities what portion should be destroyed for the sake of public 6X3 As regards the dhow and crew now under detention at .Task, Lord Morley is of c pinion that, together with the crews of the sunk dhows, they should he kept tl ere until the end of the season.

Sir, With reference to your letter No. 12126 of the 14th instant, forwarding copy of instructions, dated 4th October, issued by the Commaader-in-Chief, East Indies, to the Officer Commanding H.M.S. “ Fox ” regarding the operations for the suppression of the arms traffic in the Persian Gulf, I am directed to say that the Secretary of State for India is of opinion that a very useful purpose might be served by the temporary landing of blue-jackets, if and when practicable, for the purpose of seizing consignments of arms suspected to be stored in the neighbourhood of the coast. I am to enclose copies of telegrams from Sir G. Barclay and from the Viceroy of India on the110 subiect and to suggest that instructions should, if the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty see no objection, now be issued accordingly. Such raids would, of course be strictly limited as regards duration and scope to effecting their immediate purpose. The letter from the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, enclosed in your letter M. 13229, dated 13th instant, indicates that there are large stores of arms and ammunition within 4 or 5 miles of the coast. It would presumably be difficult, if not impossible, to remove arms and ammunition so captured, and there would be no objeotion if, in the course of the operations, they were destroyed. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your obedient servant, It. Ritchie. The Secretary, Admiralty. 220 (Received on the 27tli December 1909 with Political Secretary’s letter No. 50, dated the 10th December 1909.) [Extract from a letter from Sir TF. Goschen to Sir E. Grey, No. 369, dated Berlin, the 2nd November 1909.) Sir, The editor of the “ Deutsche Tageszeitung” has forwarded to me for my perusal a long article published in that paper respecting the relations between Great Britain and Afghanistan. The greater part of the article is merely historical, and deals with questions of fact better known to His Majesty’s Government than to the writer of the article. Its only interest lies in the concluding part which gives the German view of the result of the Anglo- Russian understanding, and of the fate which is reserved for Afghanistan. In speaking of the report that since the conclusion of the Anglo-Russian understanding, the Amir has been making every effort to place his whole people under arms, the writer of the article makes the following malicious remark “ An English newspaper reports that merchants in the Persian Gulf have furnished Afghanistan with the necessary arms of precision. The fact that a very lively trade in arms of British origin is carried on in the Persian Gulf is well known, and by no one better than the Turks, to whom it has been brought home as a bitter experience while engaged in suppressing the rising in the Yemen. ,, I have, &amp;c., W.

It will be noticed that His Highness in reply to my request for the arrest of Afghans found in Maskat states that there are none in the neighbour hood at present. According to my information, however, there are at least twenty Afghans in Maskat and Mutrah and the Sultan’s inaction is another proof of his unwillingness to assist our efforts in any way. I learn that His Highness has warned arms merchants to instruct all Afghans coming here to disguise themselves carefully in order to avoid possibi lities of trouble. 3. The arms trade is still in a state of collapse owing to the blows which have been dealt, but there are several consignments ready for shipment when a favourable opportunity arrives. I am informed that merchants who get their supplies of arms from German firms have submitted a petition to the German Government complain ing against the recent action of His Majesty’s ships. I have, however, as yet received no confirmation of this report. 4.

After leaving Karyat I steamed out to sea towards a Dhow I had sighted previously. On closing her I stopped and lowered the whaler, and sent Lieutenant Samson to board her# The position of the Dhow was then by cross bearings- Karyat Islet S. 3 ^ W. Karyat Peak S. 4 b W. Ras Abu Baud Is: $. 87 W. Lieutenant Samson afterwards reported to me that when he boarded the Dhow the crew behaved in a truculent manner, so he disarmed them of their daggers and as he saw rifles in the boat he took her in tow and brought her along side the Ship, where she was searched. The cargo was shifted with the result that 17 rifles and 1600 rounds of ammunition were discovered. 7 of these rifles were absolutely new and 10 were old. At the time of searching no explanation was offered why the rifles were there, although some of the men were wearing bandoliers, and they might have owned the older rifles. At the time of boarding the wind was from the North West and the Dhow was heading about E.N.E. c he was old and in my opinion would not have towed any distance without being swamped, so I let her go. Before she shoved off the whaler.had been hoisted with the daggers still in her. This I din not Know of until afterwards, and as there were some more Dhows in sight, I did not The Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf Division.not think it advisable to give up the opportunity of searching these craft, so that I might return the daggers to their owners. A list of gear taken out of the Bedan is attached. This was all mustered soon after she had shoved off and has now all been returned to the Multan through the Political Agent at Masqat, and the enclosed list signed as a receipt. I regret that this error in judgment on my part was committed but in justice to muse If, I would beg to submit that the new Rifles position and course of Dhow, direction or the wind, and the bearing of her supposed destination (Sur) all assisted in making me decide to confiscate her* arms.

I have made enquiries regarding the complaint made to Your Highness by the Wali of Kuriyat on the sub ject of the seizure of rifles and daggers from a Kuriyat bad an I find it is true that the articles mentioned in the enclosed list were seized. The Captain of the man-of-war took them because the men had seven new rifles and he there fore suspected that they were going to take them to the Mekran Coast. But from the Wali's letter it appears that the arms belonged to Askaris and passengers and were not being taken for smuggling. They were therefore seized by mistake and I am sorry that this should have occurred to give trouble to Your Highness. Your Highness knows that it is not our wish to trouble Your Highness 1 subjects but only to prevent the smuggling of arms to the Indian frontier. If Your Highness will send over someone to take the articles I shall have much pleasure in handing them over. The Askaris told the «?ali that money was seized, but tnis is not true.

ON receipt of your despatch No. 24, Africa, of the 28th September, an enquiry was addressed unofficially to the French Ministry for Foreign Aff airs as to whether there was any foundation for the report that the French Government had prohibited the importation of arms at Jibuti from the 15th March last, and that, owing to the protests of the merchants engaged in the traffic, the date for the enforcement of this prohibition had subsequently been postponed for one year. As no reply was received to this enquiry the matter was recalled to the attention of the Ministry last month. I have the honour to transmit to you herewith copy of a note from M.

I HAD the honour to receive on the 22nd instant your despatch Nof26, Africa, of the 18th, but it was not until yesterday evening that I was able to have an interview with the Minister for Foreign Affairs in order to carry out the instructions contained in your despatch. His Excellency had been absent from Paris, and since his return on the 27th he had been preparing for debates in the Chamber on inter pellations of which notice had been given. I reminded M. Pichon that I had had a conversation with him on the 7th instant on the subject of the arms traffic. I had reported to you the observations that he had made to me, and, in order to refresh his memory and to make sure that I had correctly reproduced what he had said, I handed to him and he read my despatch No. 34, Africa, of the 8th instant to you. I told his Excellency that I had received from you a reply to my report, in which you stated that the fulfilment by a friendly Power with special engagements towards England of a moral obligation recognised and accepted as such byother Powers could hardly be regarded as presenting a basis for a claim to com pensation, and you had directed me to remind his Excellency, with reference to his promise, to examine the question thoroughly, that the interval before the reassembly ot the Arms Conference was now short, for it was to meet on the 3rd December. M. Pichon expressed great regret that the negotiations outside the conference had not led to an agreement. It was not from want of good-will on his part. There were however, considerable difficulties in the way of accepting the proposals of a S Maje S | s Government. If, as appeared from their dropping the negotiations, they were dis satisfied with the French demands, it was a pity that oVt^CoToffies' proposals on which he could discuss the ^ estlon wl * , the , the wS with the view of considering whether some means could be deysed to meet the w sh rvf TTia MmVqfv’s Government, while avoiding measures which would raise strong o^Shionl tL Frerh Miament and from the Ministry of the Colonies, which was subject.

Owing to the opposition of the French delegates at the Conference no arrangement had been come to for controlling the trade in arras, but the French Government could not continue to refuse to agree to the precautions which the other Powers were ready to adopt against the indiscriminate supply of arms to wild trices^for it would enable them to slaughter the subjects ol a country would be asked in Parliament. What answer pleasing to with which France was on the most intimate terms. Questions France Sir Edward Grey, Bart., M.P., &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.France could be made'’ People would ask how it could be that the Government of a country with which an 'entente cordiale ’ existed refused to take measures to control a traffic which caused such injury to British interests. It would be diffi cult to assure Parliament that the conduct of France had been satisfactory. Monsieur Pichon replied that the settlement of the ques tion depended on His Majesty’s Government. If they gave proper compensation for the measures which they wished France to adopt the matter could be arranged. Negotiations for the purpose had been carried on but had not been successful be cause His Majesty’s Government had been unwilling to agree to the compensation required for the surrender by France of an existing right. I said that I could not see that any compensation would be due to France for doing what the other Powers were will ing to do. What would the French Press and public say if we insisted on supplying uncivilized natives with arms of pre cision for use against Frenchmen. Monsieur Pichon laid stress on the necessity for satis fying, the French Parliament that a proper ’quid pro quo’ had been obtained for the surrender of a right commercially im portant ,important, and insisted that compensation in some form or other must be made. He promised however to examine the question thoroughly with every desire to meet the wishes of His Majesty’s Government so far as he could consistently with a due regard for French interests.

The obligation to convey a dhow to the nearest port for search would, in his opinion, defeat the object he had in view While the war-ship was engaged in convoying the dhow, perhaps collusively dispatched, the sea would be opened for the real carriers of arms to steer an unimpeded course. The proposals with regard to spirit duties were also unacceptable. He felt therefore, that the matter would have to be dropped. As regards the French attitude, he was convinced that the only course possible was to go to the Conference and thus let it be publicly recorded that it had failed in its objects owing to the refusal of the French Government to co-operate with the other Powers in their endeavours to control the traffic.

WE duly received your letter of the 11th instant, respecting the importation of arms and ammunition into Morocco, and thank you for the information given therein. We'have delayed acknowledging the above in the hope that we should hear from you in regard to the particular point which Mr. Eddison raised at the interview in question respecting Persian Gulf business, viz. :—Why the British manufacturer or trader should be compelled to comply with certain regulations which do not exist in, or, at any rate, are not enforced by, Continental countries interested m that market. We need scarcely repeat that this one-sided arrangement is most detrimental to British trade generally, and the result is that a trade which is carried on in a perfectly legitimate manner is again being driven to the Continent. W T e do not ask for greater facilities, all we ask is that we shall not be placed in a manifestly unfair position. Mr. Langley was good enough to promise to have inquiries made on the matter, and we shall be glad to hear that as a result thereof it has been decided to withdraw such restrictions as are not imposed or in force on the Continent, so as to relieve the disadvantage under which we are at present labouring. We should also like to ask whether, if it is intended to prohibit the importation of arms and ammunition into the Persian Gulf, the manufacturers interested in that market will be given due notice thereof so as to obviate their being put to considerable loss, if not informed in sufficient time, by having in process of manufacture goods which are not suitable for any other market. In this connection we would point out that it has only just come to the knowledge of the British traders that the importation into Jibuti has been prohibited, whereas it was well-known on the Continent about the middle of January that it was intended to close that market as from the 15th instant.

His Excellency, in his Memorandum, has developed at length the reasons which induce the Government of the Republic to consider an exchange on these terms, one which should satisfy the interests and aspirations of both Governments. His Majesty’s Government have attentively examined the various points raised by his Excellency, and the conclusion they have drawn from this examination is that the view taken by the French Government may be summarized in the expression in his Excellency’s Memorandum, that on the conclusion of an Agreement His Majesty’s Government can, if they choose, find themselves in possession of two new territories, and therefore, by implication, in receipt of a territorial equivalent for the Gambia. His Majesty’s Government have, from the beginning of these negotiations^ expressed their conviction that a successful issue would depend on their receiving some territorial compensation, or its material equivalent, for the cession of the Gambia; and his Excellency’s Memorandum, while showing that the French Govern ment have fully recognized the necessity of meeting this consideration, also show r s that in the opinion of that Government this condition is adequately met by the preferred abrogation of French Treaty rights in Muscat and Zanzibar. There is here, it woukl seem to His Majesty’s Government, so radical a divergence of view between the two Governments, that a discussion on the other points raised by his Excellency would be merely academic, and His Majesty’s Government therefore propose to confine their reply to a brief expression of their reason for considering that the suggested French concessions in Muscat and Zanzibar do not constitute a territorial gain to Great Britain, or even such material advantages as would compensate them for the surrender of the Gambia to France. His Majesty’s Government cannot overlook the consideration that on the date of the cessiou, the Colony and Protectorate of the Gambia becomes, by a stroke of the pen, an absolutely French possession ; whereas the status of Muscat as a Sovereign State will remain unaltered, notwithstanding the withdrawal of France from the guarantee of independence, and her consent to a modification of the Treaty of 1844. The Sultan’s Treaties with other Powers will remain in force; and their co-operation, as well as the consent of the Sultan, will be required before the suppression of the arms traffic, which it is the object of the policy of His Majesty’s Government to secure, can be effectively carried out. Moreover, the Sultan’s consent to the measures necessary for the abolition of the traffic can hardly be secured without heavy pecuniary compensation, which the United Kingdom will have to pay. As regards Zanzibar, that island is to-day, for all practical purposes, a British possession already. His Majesty’s Government are, therefore, reluctantly constrained to consider that the offer of the French Government does not contain that adequate territorial, or [2225 ^-1] 3 +r2 equivalent material compensation, without which they feel it is hopeless for them to expect the approval of Parliament to the proposed exchange. It is with great regret that His Majesty’s Government hnd themselves forced to acknowledge the failure of their efforts to arrive at a satisfactory settlement with the Prench Government of a situation where a few private French merchants art/*** enabled to do material damage to the internal interests of the British Empire by prosecuting, under the Treaty of 1SI4, a trade in arms which only sprang up in 1898. . 1 ^ • His Majesty’s Government, therefore, while fully recognizing that the French Government have sought no less earnestly than themselves to reach a mutually satisfactory conclusion of these negotiations, feel compelled to record their opinion that the exchange now offered by the Government of the Republic is not one which they w r ould be justified in accepting. They also propose, out of deference to the other Powers who are represented at the adjourned Brussels Conference, to inform the Belgian Government that it has been found impossible to come to any agreement with the Government of the Republic on those points where a hope of settlement led to the adjournment of the Conference, and that the British Delegates will accordingly be ready to attend at Brussels on the 17th May next—the date at present agreed upon for the reassembly of the Con ference—in order that a final Protocol, embodying the results of the deliberations of the Plenipotentiaries and Delegates, may be drawn up and signed. Foreign Office, April 30, 1909. I ! ' fi fe Cji. ON the 24th March, 1909, an Inter-Depart mental Conference was held at the Foreign Office, under the presidency of Sir C. Hardinge, to consider the reply returned by the French Government on the 13th February last to the aide-memoire of the 22nd August, 1908, in which His Majesty’s Government laid down their terms for the cession of the Gambia to France. The following Government Departments were represented at the meeting :— Foreign Office, by Sir C. Hardinge and Mr. G. Clerk; India Office, by Sir W. Lee-Warner and Sir H.

Note A.—While agreeing- that the decisive balance of argument is against acceptance of the terms offered, I have to add, on behalf of the India Office, that the withdrawal of France from Muscat, and her cession of Chandernagore aud of whatever rights she may possess in the several “ loges,” if these concessions could be obtained on reasonable terms, would be of material benefit to India.— W. Lee-Warner.Notes. 1. IT is true that in the present negotia tions Great Britain is, as M. Gambon says, the “ demandeur.” We consider that, without the extension of the zone to the Arabian coast, and the power to stop the arms traffic at Muscat, the decisions of the Arms Conference will lose a great part, though not all, of their value, and to attain our end we are willing to pay the French Government, who are the practically only obstacle, a fair price. But the point is scarcely worth labouring, since we knew that the Gambia had a certain value for France, just as Muscat has for us, and the important thing is to try to arrive at an equitable basis of exchange. On previous occasions the French have tried to get us to cede the Gambia, and it does not much matter who first proposed the deal in the present case. 2. The Conference was summoned to discuss the arms traffic question in Africa, and the connection of the British proposals with the Brussels Act is therefore im material. But, as a matter of fact, our proposals originated in the circumstance that Articles 8 to 14 of the Brussels Act, dealing with the arms traffic, had not in their application been entirely efficacious, and His Majesty’s Government therefore desired to supplement that Act by stronger measures. 3. Arms are also reimported into Somali land from Muscat. [387] L’AMBASSADEUR de France aurait desire 6tre a me&gt;me de faire parvenir plus promptement sa reponse a raide-memoire qui lui a ete remis le 24 aoht dernier par son Excellence Sir Edward Grey relative- ment a ITmanat de Mascate et it la Gambie. Mais cette communication s’est trouvde soulever plusieurs questions nouvelles, qui ont dh e&gt;tre soumises par le Gouvernement de la Bepublique it I’examen des difibrents Ddpartements ministeriels int^ressds, et il en est rdsulte des retards inevitables.

To come down in our price, and see if France will not add something to hers. 1 can be dismissed at once. Apart from the consideration of whether we should be getting fair value for our money, public opinion in this country would not tolerate the cession, not so much perhaps of territory, as of native tribes, for so long under our rule, to France, without some similar compensation elsewhere. 2 has certain advantages. The cession of the Gambia will be difficult to arrange with adequate safeguards for British interests, and impossible to defend without them. On the other hand, it might be possible to devise some check on the Muscat traffic, e.g., (a.) By getting the Sultan to order all arms, &amp;c., to be deposited in a State warehouse, and only allow them to be issued to the consignee against the latter’s personal guarantee, or on the latter depositing a substantial sum as security. Some step of this sort might be taken in such a way as not to conflict with French Treaty rights, but it would, of course, be necessary for us to compensate the Sultan. This is suggested as a line of action that it might be possible to adopt, if we are driven to it, but the Foreign Office are not prepared to say without further and careful consideration, that it can be adopted. Apart from the fact that such action will give great umbrage to France, and the necessity of securing the Sultan’s consent, it must also be remembered that the 1844 Treaty gives France “ toute liberte ” to “ commercer,” and the French will fight hard, under that clause, against any attempt at restriction. Further, it is for the Cabinet to decide whether the undoubted hurt done to us by the Muscat arms traffic, taken into consideration with the fact that the prime cause thereof is France, from whom especially of the Great Powers we might reasonably expect some • approach to consideration, is sufficient to render worth while the blow to the entente, which action, such as that sketched above, must inevitably entail. (6.) By devoting the money which we are ready to spend in compensation to the Sultan for loss of revenue to more ships and closer supervision in the Gulf. ( c -) % n °f standing in the way of our traders competing for the arms trade on fair terms with the French. A representative of one of the largest British firms has stated m the Foreign Office that on even terms British trade would soon completely drive out foreign rivals, and possibly France, with her commerce gone, might be willing to drive an easier bargain for her Muscat privileges. There are, too, good reasons why Muscat is not worth paying an exorbitant price for. ^ France is, undoubtedly, the great obstacle to our efforts to check the Gulf arms, but even with h ranee out of the way our difficulties are not over. There are still otherPowers and the Sultan himself to deal with, and the arms traders make no secret of their .conviction that whatever we may do at Muscat the Gulf arms traffic will go on the huge profits are worth any risk, and the facilities for contraband trade in the Gulf are abundant. Again, the territories supplied from Muscat are to-day saturated with arms ; the great mischief has been done, the arms traffic has got a firm hold, and desirable though it may be to check the traffic now we can easily pay too much for the privilege of a free hand to deal with it. 3 is, however, worth trying first, before breaking off negotiations. We did not expect France to give all we asked, and there is much weight in the consideration that the Gambia as a marketable asset has just now about reached its top price; while the local opinion there, as reported to the Foreign Office by a representative of a business house who knows his subject, is certainly that its cession to France is inevitable sooner or later. M. Gambon has given Sir C. Hardinge, privately and confidentially, to understand that the present proposal is not the last word of the French Government, and the question is what can we now ask for. The French have declined, in an uncompromising manner, to discuss the conditions as to the New Hebrides, Manga Reva, and Newfoundland put forward by us, but have hinted that they might make some concessions as regards the loges ” in India, and in respect to Chandernagore. Such concessions, especially in Chandernagore, may have a particular value at the present time of unrest in India, but it is for the Government of India to tell us how great that value is. The Newfoundland conditions can be, and the New Hebrides will in the end have to be, abandoned, but the French objections to Manga Reva can only be based on the intention to drive the hardest possible bargain. His Majesty’s Government are not reduced by the IVluscat aims traffic to such straits that they must seek relief therefrom at any cost; and it would be preferable to break off negotiations altogether rather than to_ conclude a bargain which might be generally condemned as bad and inequitable. It might be worth while to ascertain the value attached by the Government of India to the cession of French rights in the “loges” and in Chandernagore in India, but even these in conjunction with the abrogation of French rights in Muscat and Zanzibar can hardly be regarded as a fair equivalent for the material cession of an extensive British colonial territory. It remains therefore for the inter-departmental Committee to consider what reply shall now be made to the French Government, and to submit it to the Cabinet for their approval ; but, in the opinion of the Foreign Office, public opinion in England will not be satisfied with any conditions for the cession of the Gambia which do not comprise some cession of French territory elsewhere to Great Britain.From Secretary of State to Viceroy, Foreign Department, 24th March 1909. P. —Negotiations with France. Reply to our proposals for a settlement on basis of cession of Gambia, has now been received from French Govern ment. In addition to points connected with arms traffic and Mashat, our proposals included, request for concessions in respect of New Hebrides, Newfoundland fisheries, &amp;c., on which stress is laid by Colonial O ffice. All concessions are refused by French Government, except (1) acceptance of proposals which were made at the Conference for prohibition of transport of arms by vessels under 500 tons, and, for extension to IIadramaut of zone under Brussels Act; {2) grant of “liberty of action' to Great Britain at Maskat and Zanzibar, renunciation of rights enjoyed by France under their 1844 treaty, for which a fresh treaty would have to be substituted, and abrogation of joint declaration regarding Maskat independence made in 1892. While refusing to consider the other concessions for which we asked, the French Government have given an unofficial hint, though they do not specify how far they are prepared to go, as to their willingness to make concessions in regard to Chandernagore and the “ loges.' French offer is strongly opposed, by Colonial Office, as involving cession of a colony without any return to Colonies as a whole. We are now considering the matter. I should wish to be in a position to represent your opinion as to extent to which concessions in regard to “ loges ” and Chandernagore are valuable to India. I should be glad to be favoured as soon as possible with your views on this point. Please say what concessions you would suggest as of real value.From Secretary of State to Viceroy, Foreign Department, 24th March 1909. Foreign Secret. Very confidential. Muscat. French Government have now replied to our proposals for a settlement on basis of cession of Gambia. Our proposals included, in addition to points connected with Muscat and arms traffic, request for concessions in regard to Newfoundland fisheries, New Hebrides, &amp;c., on which Colonial Office laid stress. French Govern ment refuse to make any concessions beyond : (1) acceptance of proposals made at Conference for extension of zone under Brussels Act to Hadramaut, and for prohibition of transport of guns by vessels under 500 tons; (2) o-rant to us of “liberty of action ” at Zanzibar and Muscat, renunciation of French rights under their treaty of 1844, which would have to be replaced by fresh one, and abrogation of joint declaration ol Ion- as to independence of Muscat. French Government while relusing to consider the other concessions we asked for, have hinted unofficially jneii willingness to make concessions as to Chandernagore, and the Goges, but without specifying how far they are prepared to go Colonial Office are strongly opposed to French offer, on the ground that Colonies as a whole get no return for cession of a colony. Matter is now under consideration. 1 should like to be able to represent your opinion as to value to India ot concessions in regard to Chandernagore and the “ loges.’ A hat concessions would you suggest as being really valuable ? Please let me have your views on this point as soon as possible.A ide-mSmoire. . ON the 16th June last the French Delegates to the Arms Conference at Brussels informed their British colleagues that they had been authorized by their Government to make the following proposal: — The French Government would allow His Majesty’s Government a free hand to do what they liked in Muscat in the same w r ay as Great Britain some years ago gave J ranee full liberty of action in Tunis and Madagascar, i.e., to establish a Protectorate, or, indeed, direct political control, over the Sultanate of Oman ; and they would further agree to the zone of prohibition for the traffic in arms and ammunition being extended along the shores ol Arabia as far as the southern limit of Muscat; Great Britain would in return cede to France the Colony and Protectorate of the Gambia. His Majesty’s Government have not failed to give their most careful consideration to this proposal, and now desire to offer the following remarks in regard to it:— They do not in any way seek to minimize the importance which they attach to the desirability of British influence becoming paramount at Muscat, both from the point of view of the security which would thus be given to the interests of this country in the Persian Gulf and to the facilities which would be placed at their disposal for checking the trade in arms and ammunition which at present goes on via Muscat and Somaliland and the north-west frontier of India. They must, however, point out that the importance of Muscat to Great Britain has m both these respects singularly diminished of late years. In regard to the first, the recent Anglo-Bussian Agreement has altered for the better the position of Great Britain in the localities in question in relation to that country which, from her geographical position and the situation which she has been able to create tor herself in Persia, could have seriously threatened British interests in the Gulf ; while, with respect to the second point, namely, the facility which the possession of a free hand in Muscat would afford for checking the arms traffic with the countries on the north-western frontier of India, it is to be observed that, owing to the immense development of the trade during the last few years, and to the manner in which those now conducting it may be expected to push on their operations during such time as the trade remains open, the countries with which His Majesty’s Govern ment are desirous of seeing the trade checked have become so saturated with arms that it is certain a considerable number of years must elapse before the stoppage of the traffic, however absolute it may be, can be expected to produce any appreciable result. Moreover, though no doubt the closing of Jibuti and Muscat would produce a certain effect upon the arms traffic, it is not to be imagined that those who are chiefly interested in it, whether as sellers or buyers, would sit down quietly and accept the total prohibition with which their trade would he struck. On the contrary, they would lose no time in looking about for new methods of carrying it on, and, though such new methods might not be so convenient as the old, it is pretty certain that some way of continuing the traffic, even if on a less extensive and more hazardous scale, would soon be discovered. From the point of view, therefore, both of ordinary British interests in the Persian Gulf and of the arms^ traffic, the possession of a free hand in Muscat is not of so much value as would at first sight appear; it is equally certain that it would not be particularly valuable on other grounds. It is true that the country has a population of some 500,000, that Muscat itself possesses an excellent harbour, and that its trade, which in 1906-7 amounted to about 700,000/., of which 74 per cent, was with England and India, might well be expected considerably to develop once the political conditions of the country assumed a more [797] B2 stable character. But, as against these considerations, it is to be remembered that, even after France has given up her rights under the 1841 and 1862 Treaties, Great Britain would still be left face to face with the claims and ambitions of foreign Powers, whether such have already Treaties with Muscat or not, and with an independent Sultan, who, relieved from the pressure of Prance, might raise the terms of his co-operation with this country. Prance would of course, ex %pc/!/ns?, assist in securing to His Majesty’s Government the full advantage of the relinquishment of her rights • hut, even so, much skilful diplomacy would certainly be required to obtain from the Sultan a Treaty by which he would engage to leave the conduct of his external affairs in the hands of His Majesty’s Government and to follow their advice in the treatment of the arms traffic, advice which, it may incidentally be remarked, in order to be rendered practicable would certainly have to be supplemented by a large increase of the subsidy which the Sultan at present receives from the Indian Government. Moreover, though, as has been remarked, the territory over which the protectorate of Great Britain would be extended is large and its possibilities considerable, it must not be forgotten that its development will be a work requiring not only much time but the greatest prudence, for, the Sultan’s authority being weak, and the tribes nominally accepting it fierce and warlike, any mistake in the policy followed might result in this country finding itself involved in the politics of the Yemen and the interior of Arabia, His Majesty’s Government of course understand that the expression “free hand in Muscat” which Prance would give to this countrv would mean the absolute disappearance of the Pranco-Muscat Treaty of 1814 and the Anglo-Prench Agreement of 1862. Great Britain would be prepared to assure to Prance equal commercial rights with herself, and, in regard to exterritorial jurisdiction. His Majesty’s Government would be prepared to allow Trench citizens and protected citizens to be tried by His Majesty’s Besident. So far His Majesty’s Government have confined their remarks strictly to an investigation into the value to this country of what Prance offers in return' for the cession of the Gambia; and from this line they do not desire to depart. At the same time they cannot help observing that a considerable portion of that offer consists of an assent to the zone of prohibition for the traffic in arms and ammunition being extended along the shores of Arabia as far as the southern limit of Muscat. Now, the value of that assent depends almost entirely on the fact that the Trench Govern ment decline to admit that they are under any legal obligation to prevent arms going from places within the zone to places without, and His Majesty’s Government cannot refrain from pointing out that this view is in direct contradiction to the ruling given m the matter by Baron Lambermont, the President of the first Brussels Conference, a ruling which was obtained at the instance of His Majesty’s Govern ment, and which they themselves, so far as they are concerned, have always most carefully followed. It is, moreover, to be observed that the cost of rendering effective the extension of the zone of prohibition to the Hadramaut coast, wdiich w r ould be consideiable, would fall entirely on His ^Majesty’s Government. To turn now to the consideration of the price which His Majesty’s Government aie asked to pay for the advantages discussed above—the cession, that is, of the Go ony and Protectorate of the Gambia, a cession of which, of course, a necessary C (* 1 n 1 ^ 1 - 0 ? satisfactory arrangements should be made for the protection 0 n is i trade, for the security of the interests of the various officials and pensioners, re various missionary and educational establishments and the native inhabitants, and especially of the Chiefs. His Majesty s Government are anxious to discuss the question in as impartial a spin as re circumstances wdll allow. They therefore at once admit that, though t ie ln JP°^ f nd combined were valued in 1906 at 876,000/., 408,000/. out of 10 ’ ‘ Which is the annual value of the exports goes elsewhere than to the m et vingc om, and less than half the imports come from this country, vdiile of the five principal firms only one is British, the others being Trench. , . , le 7 ai ® a ncd unaware of Article 5 of the Agreement of the 8th April, 190-1, U 1 1 C 1 ^ lves 0 ^ iance Yarbutenda, and, should the river there not be open to maritime nav iga ion, access to a point lownr down the river which can be reached by merchant- s ups engagec in maritime navigation, and they cannot affect to conceal from themselres . f 1 r ,, e 7 xecu , 10n . ^ ^ 118 Article, even though the wide interpretation placed upon * ', , ie i ie 7 c 1 d ncd upheld in arbitration, could not fail seriously to diminish no a a ue o i o Colony and Protectorate. Nor can it be doubted that, if ever the 1 1 ove i n uient were to carry out the project which they are said to entertain of Britis^i^tiade^ 1 l^ 13 ^ ^ ^ ie r iver, considerable damage w r ould be inflicted on3 ! n % But as against this the Colony and Protectorate combined has an area of from 4,000 to 5,000 square miles; it possesses an excellent seaport capable of conversion into a strong naval position, and a waterway which is unique in Africa, since, unlike all other African rivers, the Gambia has neither delta nor bar to obstruct navigation. The river is no less than 27 miles across at the mouth and 2?r miles wide at Bathurst, the capital. It is safe to enter, as there is never less than 27 feet of water, and it is navigable for some 150 miles by steamers drawing 12 feet, and for some 80 miles farther by vessels of 10 feet draught. And, lastly, it is now said that gold in paying quantities has been found in the upper reaches of the river. The Gambia has therefore certain positive advantages, which might, indeed, diminish somewhat in value, but which could never be entirely destroyed, and last, but not least, the first settlement having been established there as long ago as the reign of James I, it has a sentimental value which cannot be disregarded in view of the fact that its cession would have to be ratified by Parliament. Apart, however, from the positive advantages enjoyed by the Colony, it is obvious that it has a peculiar value for France, since so long as this long wedge of territory remains driven far into the heart of the French possessions in that part of Africa it is impossible for the French authorities to enjoy freedom in regard to the imposition of duties. Moreover, once the Gambia was in the hands of France there need be no question of the construction of the costly railway which has already been alluded to. — On a review, therefore, of the terms of the bargain which has been proposed by the French Government, a review which they have endeavoured to make as impartial as possible, His Majesty’s Government cannot but feel that it is not one which they would be justified in laying before Parliament, or which that body would be likely to accept, especially in view of the fundamental difference which, apart from every other consideration, exists between the two objects of barter, the French Government, on the one hand, offering a renunciation of certain Treaty rights which they now enjoy and the acceptance of certain new Treaty obligations (to which it would, however, be remarked that other Powers have assented without compensation), and, on the other hand, asking His Majesty’s Government to surrender a definite territorial possession. At the same time His Majesty’s Government are sincerely anxious, if they can possibly do so, to continue to pursue the policy in regard to the relations of Great Britain and France which has been followed for some years past, and which consists, as the French Government are aware, in endeavouring to remove all causes of friction between the two countries. They have therefore cast about to see if there might not be some other items which France might be disposed to throw into the scale, and which would turn the bargain now under discussion into one which they could present to Parliament and the country generally with a reasonable hope of seeing it approved. Of these items, the first would be the renunciation of the 1814 and 1862 Treaties with Muscat, not only in so far as they concern that Sultanate, but also in so far as they concern Zanzibar. The latter Treaty, which, in so far as Zanzibar is in question, deals with the guarantee of its independence, would disappear altogether; the former would be replaced by a Treaty guaranteeing French citizens and French-protected citizens similar rights with British subjects and British-protected subjects. But the surrender of these two Treaties would not, in His Majesty’s Government’s opinion, make up the difference which exists between the value of the Gambia and the price offered for it by the French Government; that difference would, in their view, only disappear if the French Government were ready to make certain concessions in other parts of the world. They propose that these concessions should take the following form :— 1. New Hebrides. —As the French Government are aware, the relations between the two countries in these islands are at present regulated by the Convention of 1906, which places France and Great Britain on an exactly equal footing in the group from a legal point of view. But that Convention gives neither Power any territorial rights; it expressly, indeed, forbids the natives to become either British subjects or French citizens, and leaves them and their country neither under British nor French protection. There can be no doubt that it was much better that the Convention in question should be concluded than that the islands should be left in a state ol chaos, but, from the very circumstances of the case, it seems clear that it can only be considered as a temporary arrangement, which, even while it lasts, is sure to produce occasions of friction between British subjects and French citizens. His Majesty’s [797] B 24 Government would therefore propose that Prance should hand over their rights in the Kew Hebrides to Great Britain. There are also the private rights and claims of the French New Hebrides Company to be considered. His Majesty’s Government would propose that explicit . provision for the acquisition of all French private rights, and especially those of the f French .New Hebrides Company, should be included. It would of course be understood that the cession by France of her rights in the New Hebrides should carry with it entire liberty to His Majesty’s Government to regulate or, if necessary, to prohibit at any time the emigration of natives of the New Hebrides to labour in New Caledonia or elsewhere. It would be hard to justify an arrangement under which British subjects might be recruited to work without His Majesty’s Government having any power of restriction or regulation. 2. Coaling Station in Pacific .—His Majesty’s Government must also ask for the cession of an island in the Pacific on the direct route between Panama and Australia having the necessary conditions for the establishment of a coaling station. They believe that such an island might be found in Manga Beva, one of the Gambier Islands, but it would have to be left to subsequent inquiry to determine its suitability. It should be noted that this is the only complete transfer of territory for which His Majesty’s Government ask, and that the island in question is too small to have any commercial value except as a coaling station. 3. Newfoundland.—there are certain concessions in Newfoundland to which His Majesty’s Government attach the highest importance especially as removing a constant cause of friction between the two countries. The Anglo-French Convention of 1904 left to France the following rights and privileges :— (1.) The possession of the islands of St. Pierre and Miquelon. (2.) The right of fishing on a footing of equality with British subjects in the waters of the Treaty Coast. (3.) The right of entering the ports, harbours, &amp;c., of the Treaty Coast for shelter, bait, and supplies subject to the same regulations as the inhabitants of Newfoundland. (1.) The financial straits in which St. Pierre and Miquelon have of late found themselves led recently to rumours that France was contemplating their abandon ment and to an inquiry from the Canadian Government as to the truth of these rumours. In such communication as ensued, it was stated that the rumours in question were unfounded, but the French Government contended that, in the event of France deciding to relinquish the islands, she was free to dispose of them as she thought fit. This contention was questioned by His Majesty’s Government, on the ground that, having undertaken by the Declaration of Versailles in 1783 that the islands should not become an “object of jealousy” between the two Powers, France was bound to consult His Majesty’s Government before parting with them to a third Power. It would, however, be very satisfactory for the future happy relations of both countries if such a possible source of friction could be removed ; and His Majesty’s Government would therefore propose that France should formally recognize the British reversionary title to the islands, and undertake not to cede them to any Power except this country. (2.; The right of fishing on a footing of equality with British subjects in the waters of the Treaty Coast is at present only exercised by a small and decreasing number of a essels.^ It cannot be considered, therefore, to be of any very great value to France. There is, however, at this moment a discussion proceeding between the two Govern ments as to the conditions on which that right shall be exercised, and it is obvious that it would be highly advantageous to the interests of both Governments to have this possible cause of difference removed. (3.) No practical inconvenience at present attaches to the exercise by French citizens of^ the right of entering the ports, harbours, &lt;fcc., of the Treaty Coast for shelter, bait, and supplies on the same terms as the inhabitants of Newfoundland. But past expeiience has shown how easily almost any fishing right enjoyed by a third Power in Newfoundland waters becomes a source of friction, and His Majesty’s Goa eminent are strongly of opinion that the occasion of the present negotiations should be taken to remove all possible danger in this quarter. jo sum up, the counter-proposals now put forward bv His Majesty’s Government may be stated as follows:— ^ j Great Britain on her part would cede to France the Colony and Protectorate ofr o the Gambia, subject, of course, to satisfactory arrangements being made for the protection of British trade, for the security of the interests of the various officials and pensioners, the various missionary and educational establishments, and the native inhabitants, and especially of the Chiefs ; while Prance, on her part, would— ^ (a.) Agree to the abrogation of the Anglo-French Declaration of the 10th March, 1862 and the French Treaty with Muscat of the 17th November, 1841, so far as to insure (1) full liberty of action to Great Britain in Muscat and (2) the disappearance of all the present exceptional and inconvenient privileges enjoyed by French citizens and French-protected persons in the mainland and island dominions of the Sultan ot Zanzibar. The guarantee of the independence of the Sultan of Zanzibar which is contained in the Declaration of 1862 would of course equally disappear with that ol the independence of the Sultan of Muscat; ™ , (b.) Agree to the extension of the zone of prohibition for the arms traliic to the line of Arabia as far as the southern limit of Muscat; (c.) Betire from the New Hebrides in favour of Great Britain ; (d.) Cede a suitable coaling station in the Pacific to this country ; and (e.) So far as Newfoundland is concerned—- 1 . Undertake not to part with the islands of St. Pierre and Miquelon except to Great Britain; 2. Abandon French fishing rights on the Treaty Least ; and 3. Relinquish the right to enter the ports, harbours, &amp;c., of the iicatv Coast for shelter, bait, and supplies. Foreign Office, August 22, 1008, l6 -l. - Zt H ^ PROPOSED CESSION OE THE GAMBIA TO FRANCE. DURING the course of the Conference on the Arms Traffic now sitting at Brussels the French Government have made the following proposals :— They have now the honour to report in the following terms : 1. To give His Majesty’s Government full liberty of action in Muscat; 2. To agree to the extension of the zone of prohibition for arms traffic along the shores of Arabia as far as the southern limit of Muscat; and 3. To revise the existing French Treaty with Zanzibar (though this condition has not been definitely offered as yet) : in return for the cession to France by Great Britain of the Colony and Protectorate of the Gambia. On the 9tli and 16th July, 1908, an Inter-Departmental Conference to consider this proposal was held at the Foreign Office, under the presidency of Sir C. Hardinge, at which the following Government Departments were represented :— Foreign Office, by Sir C. Plardinge and Mr. G. Clerk ; India Office, by Sir JV. Eee-Warner and Sir R. Ritchie; Colonial Office, by Mr. Antrobus and Mr. Strachey ; War Office, by Major-General Ewart; Admiralty, by Captain Slade ; and Board of Trade, by Sir H. Llewellyn-Smith, Mr. 'Wilson Fox, and Mr. Stanley. The first point for consideration is the relative value, to Great Britain and to France, of the Gambia, and whether its cession is practically possible. The Gambia claims to be one of the oldest British Colonies, the first settlement having been established there in the reign of James I, and there is consequently a sentimental objection to parting with it to another Power. As a Colony it is particularly flourishing, and its trade, imports and exports combined, which in 1906 amounted to 876,000/. (including bullion and specie), is increasing. This commerce is principally carried in British ships, but practically all the exports go to countries outside the ''United Kingdom, which provides less than half the imports, while only one of the principal firms in the Colony is British, the remainder being almost entirely French Moreover, the French are in a position to diminish seriously the value of the Gambia bv insisting on the fulfilment of Article 5 of the Agreement of the 8th April, 1904, whereby they are given Yarbutenda at the head of the Protectorate, and, should the river there not be open to maritime navigation, access to a point lower down the river which can be reached by merchant-ships engaged in maritime navigation. Also in the event of not obtaining the Gambia, the French will probably carry out their project to build a railway parallel to the river, which will considerably damage British trade. As a set-off to these considerations there remains the fact that the situation of the Gambia is such that it is impossible for the French to prevent smuggling from that Colony into their own possessions, and consequently, so long as it remains British, there is a considerable check on the levying by Iiance of differential duties in the adjacent territories. In this respect the position is not unlike that at Muscat, where the French rights under the joint protectorate prevent [746] Bthe adoption by His Majesty’s Government of any effectual measures for restraining the traffic in arms. ... , J p The strategic value of Bathurst, the capital, as a coaling station and port oi refuse in time of war, is discounted for us by the possession of Sierra Leone. When the question of coaling-stations was examined the relative meiits of the two haibours were considered, and the conclusion was arrived at that for British purposes the latter was far preferable, and, moreover, it may be said that the Bower that holds the sea holds the Gambia. Bor France, on the other hand, the Gambia has a very real value. Its possession would secure the disappearance of an inconvenient wedge of territory in the centre of an important African possession, 'would save the necessity for the costly railway at present contemplated, and would ultimately allow the French colonial authorities greater freedom with regard to tariffs in their territories in West Africa. France would further secure an 'excellent seaport capable of conversion into a strong naval position, a magnificent water-way, with neither bar nor delta to prevent vessels of 12 feet draught ascending the river for 150 miles, and those drawing 10 feet for 230 miles, besides actual territory of some 1,000 or 5,000 square miles in extent. There are, however, difficulties which need the most serious consideration before the question of cession can be determined upon. These difficulties can be divided into two categories :— (a.) The necessity of thoroughly safeguarding the interests of the present inhabitants of the Gambia and of our trade with the Colony; and (b.) The obligation to prove to the satisfaction of Parliament and public opinion that the return for the cession has been adequate in all respects. A consideration of (b) will be included in the discussion of what is to be required from France in return for the cession of the Gambia. As regards (a), it is clear that unless a satisfactory solution can be arrived at, the whole negotiation falls at once to the ground. Sir G. Denton, the Governor of the Colony, has been telegraphed for, and is expected home on the 27th July, but until his arrival it is not possible to do more than to give an outline of the points that will call for satisfactory settlement before Parliament can be asked to acquiesce in the proposed arrangement. The main points are briefly :— 1. An arrangement securing equality with France for British trade and shipping in Gambia for a period of at least thirty years, and most-favoured-nation treatment thereafter, coupled with an engagement on the part of France not to increase the existing discrimination against British goods or to discriminate against British shipping in Senegal. 2. The interests of the officials, white and coloured, wdio number about 270 (exclusive of soldiers, but including 100 coloured police), and draw salaries amounting to about 19,000/. per annum. A considerable number of the officials are serving in posts pensionable from Gambia funds. 3. Pensioners, of whom there are twenty-three, whose pensions come to 1,000/. per annum. 4. Missionary and educational establishments. 5. Perhaps the most important and most difficult point to arrange—the interests of the native inhabitants, particularly the Chiefs, and more especially Moussa Mollah, whose extradition has been demanded by the French, but refused on the ground that he was a political refugee. Should it appear to His Majesty’s Government that, provided these and similar points con be satisfactorily settled, and provided a fully adequate return for the Gambia can be secured from the French, the question is one which may be allowed in the sphere of practical politics, the terms which should be asked in return for the cession must be considered. It is in the first place clear, not only from the considerations already dwelt upon, but also from the frequent attempts of the French Government to open negotiations for the cession of the Gambia, that they are very desirous of securing it, and a con siderably higher price than they have as yet offered may therefore be reasonably asked. On the other hand, it would also seem that the Gambia as a marketable asset in our hands has now reached its highest value, and will never again command so good a price. Q■MM “ f ' Muscat. The Trench Government have themselves made an offer of complete liberty of 'faction in Muscat, and this should he the first of the conditions to be required of them; a free hand in Muscat has a great value for His Majesty’s Government, and, incidentally, a settlement on this point would enable the Arms Conference to secure a definite and practical result. France would be expected actively to assist in securing to Great Britain the full advantage of the relinquishment of her rights. The abrogation of Treaty rights in Muscat cannot, however, be regarded as in any sense an adequate compensation for such an important cession of territory as the Gambia. If France were to withdraw from the Joint Protectorate over Muscat guaranteed by the 1862 Treaty, Great Britain would still be left face to lace with— 1. The claims and ambitions of foreign Powers having Treaties with the Sultan, and also of Germany ; 2. An independent Sultan, who, relieved from the pressure of France, might raise the terms of his co-operation with the British. It would be necessary to approach the Sultan with a revised Treaty before he suspected the withdrawal of France from her position of a Guaranteeing Power. He should be required inter alia, and in return for certain considerations, as to which the Government of India will have to be consulted, to leave the conduct of his external affairs in the hands of His Majesty’s Government, and to follow their advice in the treatment of the arms traffic. It must be remembered, however, that the Sultan’s authority is weak, and it would be necessary to be careful to avoid being drawn into the internal politics of Yemen and the interior. The position of Great Britain in the Gulf of Oman and the Persian Gulf would by such an arrangement be greatly strengthened and a substantial increase of British trade in those territories might be anticipated. Indeed, from a commercial point of view, Muscat is really more promising than the Gambia. On the other hand, it is possible that in spite of British control over Muscat, the arms traffic which His Majesty’s Government are so anxious to suppress might revive after a time by other routes, and thus reduce the value of one of the principal gains to be obtained in return for the cession of the Gambia ; but in any case the advantage of arresting the present trade is substantial. On the whole, then, although it cannot be denied that the French proposal relating to Muscat presents some very advantageous aspects from the point of view of His Majesty’s Government, it is equally clear that the advantages to be thus obtained are not sufficiently attractive to justify negotiations for the cession of the Gambia on such a basis unless substantial concessions elsewhere are at the same time granted by the Government of the Republic. Zanzibar. Since France, to carry out her proposal as to Muscat, would have to revise or abrogate the Anglo-French Agreement of the 10th March, 1862, and the French Treaty with Muscat of the 17th November, 1844, she should be asked at the same time to abandon the ex-territorial privileges still remaining to her in Zanzibar under those instruments. These privileges are of little use to France, save as a means of making a bargain or of causing annoyance, and it may be reasonably expected that this request will be granted. Extension of Zone of Prohibition. The French Government have already offered to agree to the extension of the zone of prohibition for the arms traffic to the shores of Arabia as far as the southern limit of Muscat. Too much value should not be attached to this concession on their part, since it is a moral obligation which has already been accepted by all the other Powers represented at the Arms Conference: moreover, the cost of the restrictive measures introduced on the Hadramaut would fall on His Majesty’s Government. In the next place, it must be borne in mind that Canada, Newfoundland, and Australia have for some time thought that, should the Gambia ever be ceded to France, some satisfactory settlement of the New Hebrides and Newfoundland questions ought to form part of the bargain, and it seems desirable to endeavour to satisfy colonial sentiment on these points.f 4 'New Hebrides. Public opinion in this country nil! also certainly require that, in the event of the Gambia being ceded to Prance, the loss of the natives handed over to another Power should be counter-balanced by a humanitarian gain elsewhere, and this could be achieved by the complete acquisition of the New Hebrides, where an unsatisfactory condominium at present exists. In any negotiations as to the cession of the Gambia, therefore, we think that the first thing, or at least one among the first, for which His Majesty’s Government ought to ask is undivided possession of the New Hebrides. The main reason for acquiring the New Hebrides is the value which is attached to them by Australian sentiment, springing partly from the arduous and long- continued labours of Australian missionaries in the group, partly from the extra ordinary sensitiveness of Australia to any increase and, indeed, to the existence of foreign influence in the Pacific. Any step which will have the effect of diminishing that influence is certain to be received in the Commonwealth with the utmost gratification. It may be added that, from the purely British point of view, it would be of much practical advantage to get rid of the Prench from the New Hebrides. The Joint Protectorate established under the 1906 Convention is bound to be difficult to work. It can only be a temporary measure, but even while it lasts it is sure to produce occasions of friction between British subjects and Prench citizens, and, consequently, between the two Governments. It is better than leaving the islands in a state of chaos; but, in the interests both of Great Britain and Prance (not to mention the natives of the group), it would be far more desirable that one of the two countries should have undivided possession. Nor can Prance as a Government be said to be giving up very much in handing over the^ New Hebrides to Great Britain. Until 1906 the country vats simply a ‘ no-man’s land.’’ Prench citizens had no more rights there than Germans or Suedes. Under the Arrangement of 1906 Prance has no territorial rights. The nathesare not Prench subjects; in fact, the Convention expressly forbids them to become either Prench or British subjects. The country is not even under Prench protection any more than it is under British. The position is simply that P.ance and Great Britain stand on an exactly equal footing in the group from a legal point of \new, and that footing is not one of territorial dominion. bhe Prench Government have spent a certain amount of money on the group; K A T ave subsidized mail steamers to the group for some years ; they have granted icmission of duties to the produce of Prench settlers in the New Hebrides when exported to New Caledonia, &amp;c.; they have paid a small number of officials, and mnt a residency; and, most important of all, they have subsidized the French New eondes Company for many years. But the total of these expenses cannot be on lageousl}' large; and if any money payment is required, it must be remembered U0 ogoT ' 1 offered to pay interest at 3 per cent, on a sum not exceeding In dealing with the public rights of the Prench in the New 7 Hebrides, His Majesty’s cn einment should, v r e consider, be careful to obtain entire liberty to regulate, or, ! if eC( f ? - Sai %d prohibit at any time the emigration of natives of the New Hebrides to J ^ om ] m 1 ^^donfa or elsewhere. Hitherto His Majesty’s Government have neve 1 lac , and have not now, any control over or responsibility for the recruiting of i lt lY ir a Hebrides under the French flag to work in New Caledonia; nor l !\ is Majesty s Government have had any means of assuming such control, un ess we wench government gave it. But the case will, of course, be altered if the Tr^vr * e A 1C i es r / ecome a British possession; in that event, it w T ould be essential that : y . p 1,1 ] 08 ^ 8 m r nment S ^ 0U ^ l lave the power to regulate or prohibit recruiting for - ew aecoma. It w ould be hard to justify an arrangement under which British &gt; ii qa, s mig ,c )e recruited to work in the mines there wdthout His Majesty’s Government having any power of restriction or regulation. , • n ,0 e ’ ^ ieai difficulty in the case of the New Hebrides appears to us l n r^' 1 u ~ aia 10 k‘ 10 Public rights of the French Government, and the price to be paid for them should not therefore be large. Birli^different with the private rights of Prench Corporations and t'm&gt; PviHc] 8 ' ffl &gt;e settlers are not numerous (though they considerably exceed sei But the i reach New Hebrides Company claims to own a verylarge share of the land of the group, including all the most valuable parts. It would detract enormously from the value of acquiring the New Hebrides, unless some arrangements were made at the same time to acquire the land claims of the Company, ^and remove it finally from the group. We therefore suggest that, in asking for the abandonment of the French political rights, His Majesty’s Government should ask also for the entire relinquishment by the French New Hebrides Company of its private rights and claims. If, as is very possible, the French Government refuse to consider this latter proposal, it will no doubt become a question of pecuniary compensation, all or part of which Australia might reasonably he asked to pay. But we think it essential that some arrangement should he made for acquiring the French New Hebrides Company’s rights and claims. Our conclusions, then, with regard to the New Hebrides, are as follows :— 1. That the acquisition of the French public rights (including the right to recruit natives for New Caledonia) should be one of the first objects of His Majesty’s Govern ment in any negotiations as to the cession of the Gambia. 2. That those rights are not of great value, amounting only to a half-share in a kind of Joint 1 rotectorate, and including nothing in the shape of territorial dominion. 3. That explicit provision for acquiring, if necessary, all French private rights, and in any case those of the French New Hebrides Company, is essential to a satisfactory arrangement. The inclusion of the New Hebrides as a part of the bargain would thus seem well calculated to conciliate public opinion both at home and in the Colonies, and therefore a point of Imperial importance, in which Australia is specially interested, may perhaps be considered here before turning to the question of Newfoundland. Coaling Station in the Pacific. It is of the highest importance, from an Imperial point of view, to look forward to the naval situation which will be created by the successful completion of the Panama Canal, of which there can now be no doubt. It will then be necessary for His Majesty’s Government to possess a good coaling station on the direct route between the Panama Canal and Australia and New Zealand, but it may not be easy at a later date to acquire it, save at prohibitive cost, whereas the present occasion offers an opportunity for so doing at a reasonable price. The British possession nearest to the direct route, and most suitably placed as regards distances, is Pitcairn Island, but it unfortunately possesses no anchorage. The New Hebrides, again, are far out of the route of communications. There, is, however, an island belonging to I ranee, Manga Beva (Gambier Islands), which promises to fulfil these conditions. It is of substantial area, elevated, and there is reason to believe that it possesses a sufficiently good harbour, though this cannot be definitely ascertained until a survey has been made. It would accordingly seem desirable to ask for the cession of an island in the Pacific on the direct route between Panama and Australia, having the necessary conditions for the establishment of a coaling-station, leaving it to subsequent inquiry to determine the suitability of Manga Beva. Newfoundland. Finally, we would recommend to His Majesty’s Government to require certain concessions in Newfoundland, which, if secured, would greatly gratify both that Colony and Canada, and would, owing to the interest taken in the Newfoundland question at home, be no less welcome to public opinion in this country. The Anglo-French Convention of 1901 left to France the following rights and privileges :— 1. The possession of the Islands of St. Pierre and Miquelon. [746] CThe financial straits in which these islands have found themselves of late led recently to rumours that Prance was contemplating their abandonment, and to an inquiry from the Canadian Government as to the truth of those rumours. In the correspondence with the Prench Government which ensued, the Prench^P^ Government stated in effect that the rumours were unfounded, but they gave occasion +■ for a certain amount of disquietude by contending that, in the event of Prance deciding to relinquish the islands, she was free to dispose of them as she thought tit. This contention was resisted by His Majesty’s Government on the ground that having undertaken, by the Declaration of Versailles in 1783, that the islands should not become an &lt;c object of jealousy ” between the two Powers, Prance was bound to consult His Majesty’s Government before parting with them to a third Power. The only third Power to whom the islands could be transferred is the United States. In view of their geographical position and their previous connection with the British Crown, their cession to the United States would be viewed with the gravest concern in British North America. The Anglo-French Convention of 1901 was intended to settle all the differences arising out of the old Treaties with Prance relating to Newfoundland, but it made no provision for safeguarding the reversionary title of this country under those Treaties to the Islands of St. Pierre and Miquelon. As an arrangement involving the cession of the Gambia may he regarded from some points of view as complementary to the Convention of 1904, it is recommended that as a part of the terms of cession His Majesty’s Government should include a stipulation that Prance shall recognize the British reversionary title to the islands, and undertake not to cede them to any Pow r er except this country. 2. The right of fishing on a footing of equality with British subjects in the waters of the Treaty Coast. This right is only exercised by a couple of vessels belonging to a single owner; but while it is of no practical value to the Prench, it is a source of trouble and inconvenience to His Majesty’s Government for two reasons :— First, there is an active dispute between the two Governments as to the condi tions on which the rights shall be exercised ; Secondly, even if that dispute were settled in our favour, His Majesty’s Govern ment would still be bound by the arrangement embodied in the Convention of 1904, under which the joint fishery is to he policed by vessels of the national navies of the two 1 oivers. It is very desirable to terminate this arrangement, not only because it involves His Majesty’s Government in an obligation, without limit of time, to detach one ol His Majesty’s ships for police duties in Newfoundland waters for several months m each year, hut also because it has the appearance of treating British waters as il they were part of the open sea. r best wa 7 of determining this arrangement would he to obtain the surrender ° 1 .

French Treaty Rights in Muscat. The instruments which govern the relations between France and Muscat are— * (1.) The Treaty of Commerce, 1844. _ ^ (2.) The joint Declaration by Great Britain and France, loo2. (IV The Treaty (which is in some respects reciprocal, and in others applies only to the rights of French subjects in Muscat) extends to 4 ranee the following ^ ' Rights of residence, trading, &amp;c., with most favoured nation. Rights of owner ship in Muscat—lands, houses, &amp;c. (Articles 2 and 3.) . . Subjects of the Sultan in the service of the French to enjoy the same privileges as are qr anted to the French themselves. (Articled.) . . . The right to appoint Consuls; and powers of Consulai jurisdiction in certain cases as between subjects of the Sultan and French subjects. (Articles D and 6.) Provisions for the disposal of the property of French subjects ^ dying m the dominions of the Sultan ; provisions for the bankruptcy of French subjects (m which case the French Consul apparently acts as receiver), and their discharge ; provisions for payment of debts. (Articles 7, 8, and 9.) ^ , Most favoured nation as regards import duties, and no such duty to exceed a rate of 5 per cent. Beyond such duty no further charges to be levied on French vessels, and no charges for vessels putting in to refit, inquire about the state of the market, &amp;c. French vessels to enjoy most-favoured-nation privileges. (Article 10.) Fo prohibitions to be allowed against the importation into or exportation from Muscat of any hind of merchandize. “ The trade shall be absolutely free . . ., subject to the above-mentioned duty [5 per cent.] and to no otherF (Here follows a restriction as to trade in ivory and gum copal within a certain area.) (Article 11.) Provisions for settling disputes as to the value of imported goods ; right of trading with belligerents, should one party to the Treaty be at war ; proyisions for the protection and succour of French ships in distress or wrecked. (Articles 12, 13, 14, and 15.) _ . Provisions for the pursuit by the Sultan’s authorities of persons, not belonging to a Christian nation, who steal goods from a French vessel. (Article 16.) Right of the French “ to hire or erect houses and warehouses at Zanzibar or anywhere else.” (Article 17.) It is to be noted that, previous to the exchange of ratifications, the French declared that Article 17 “ was considered as having reference to matters simply and purely of a commercial nature.” (2.) The “ Declaration respecting the Independence of Muscat and Zanzibar ” is quite short, and simply declares that Great Britain and France engage reciprocally to respect the independence of the Sultans of Muscat and Zanzibar. By a Declaration in 1890, France consented to modify this arrangement as regards Zanzibar, and recognized the British Protectorate, but at the same time reserved any rights or immunities enjoyed by her citizens in the territories in question. It is understood that France has since renounced extra-territorial jurisdiction. The provisions in the French Treaty, which are or may be obstacles in the way of the realization of British aims in Muscat, appear to be contained in Articles 4, 10, and 11. . Article 4 might seriously embarrass us in that it creates a number of quasi-French citizens, who are only amenable to the regular authority of the Sultan if they commit some crime or infraction of the law. So long as it can be invoked, the Joint Declaration of course prevents our taking any steps in the direction of establishing a Protectorate over Muscat, and even if this difficulty were removed by consent of the French Government there would still remaincertain Treaty rigLts to which France is entitled which would stand in the way of our having an entirely free hand in the Sultan’s dominions. The offer of France to agree to the extension of the zone of prohibition for the traffic in arms and ammunition so as to cover the southern portion of Arabia would still leave us faced by the provisions of the 1844 Treaty, restricting import duties to 5 per cent, ad valorem, and forbidding prohibition against the import or export of any article. Our hands would still be tied in dealing with the question of gun-running in Muscat, unless we could induce France to waive these rights so far as regards arms and ammunition. (C.)—Other Countries enjoying Treaty Rights in Muscat. * - # (1.) The United States .—The Treaty of Amity and Commerce of 1833 between the United States of America and Muscat provides generally for freedom of entry, trade, residence, &amp;c., freedom from discrimination as regards duties, dues, and taxes, succour of vessels in distress, protection against pirates, and right to appoint Consuls with powers of Consular jurisdiction. The only provisions which appear to have any importance as regards British interests are as follows :— Article 3 provides that no import duty shall be higher than 5 per cent., and that “ this shall be in full consideration of all import and export duties, tonnage, licence to trade, pilotage, anchorage, or any other charge whatever.” Article 2 provides that American citizens shall have free liberty to enter with their cargoes “ of whatever kind the said cargoes may consist,” and to sell the same to subjects of the Sultan or to others who may wish to purchase. The last paragraph of this Article says: “ It is understood and agreed, however, that the articles of muskets, powder, and ball can only be sold to the Government in the Island of Zanzibar, but in all other ports of the Sultan the said munitions of war may be freely sold without any restriction whatever to the highest bidder.” These stipulations would appear to prevent the adoption of either prohibition or prohibitive rates of duty to prevent gun-running. It seems clear that in order to enable us to exercise an effective control in Muscat, even after satisfactory arrangement has been made with France, we shall have to obtain the assent of the Lhiited States to the abrogation of the extra-territorial privileges to which they are entitled under the Treaty of 1833, as we had to do in the case of Zanzibar. (2.) Holland .—A Commercial Declaration was concluded between Holland and Muscat in 1877. It provides for most-favoured-nation treatment for the subjects and flag of the Kingdom of the Netherlands and its Colonies, and for most-favoured-nation treatment for goods produced in or consigned from those dominions as regards import duties. All matters affecting exportation and transit are also to be regulated on the basis of most-favoured-nation. The provisions of this Declaration, which are purely commercial, do not touch the question of our position in Muscat. (3.) Portugal .—An Arrangement between the Sultan of Muscat and the Governor- General of Mozambique respecting trade, jurisdiction, wrecks, &amp;c., was concluded in 1826 ' This provides for the extension of rights of trading, commerce, and legal procedure to subjects of each of the respective parties in the territories of the other. (“ Trade shall be, as with us, so with you, and whatever is in favour of our subjects shall be in favour of your subjects,” &amp;c.) It also provides for the payment by vessels arriving from Muscat at Mozambique of “ c*ie in ten, the same as the people of Din and Damns,” and further lays down that “ Our (i.e., Portuguese) subjects shall deliver to them the dues like as his subjects deliver to us.” There are also provisions for the salvage of wrecks. It does not appear that this Arrangement has any bearing upon the British position in Muscat.nifwi ii the trade, SHIPPING, &amp;C., of muscat. The area of Muscat is 81,000 square miles, and its population about 1,000,000. The population is said to be a mixed one, chiefly Arabs, including a large number of Iit dians The revenue is about 250,000 dollars - annually. nQ n ^cqz • i • i + + The total foreign trade in 1907-8 amounted to 939,468/., m which total the shares of the principal countries were as follows Per cent.

The Indian share of the trade in the earlier years was about 65 per cent. ; it is not possible to trace the respective shares of the other countries for those years. .

There has been a great growth in the total tonnage entered in recent years, which, however, was checked in 1907-8. The figures for that year were still larger than they were for 1904-5 or years immediately preceding. In the year 1907-8, 86'03 per cent, of the tonnage was British ; next in importance came Germany with 5'63 per cent., Muscat with 2'58 per cent., and Russia with 2'36 per cent. It is worth remarking that the German shipping is mentioned separately for the first time in the Consular Report for 1906-7. Trade with the United Kingdom .—This is not shown separately in the Consular Report for 1888-9, and a comparison with that year is therefore not possible.

Trade ivith India .—India holds by far the largest share of the Muscat trade. That share amounted to 52’7 per cent, in 1907-8, having been 66T per cent, in 1906-7, 70*4 per cent, in 1905-6, and 63 per cent, in 1904-5.

In 1902-3 the imports under this head amounted to some 43,000Z. ; they rose to about 120,000L in 1904-5, and dropped to about 72,000L in 1905-6, and have risen to 112,000L in 1906-7 and 279,000Z. in 1907-8. Almost the whole quantity of arms and ammunition imported during 1906-7 was stated in the Consular Report for that year to have been re-exported before the report itself was written. No figures, however, available to show the destination of these re-exports.

In those days our rule extended only over the natives in the 69 square miles of the Colony proper, whereas at present the much larger number of natives in the protected area have to be considered, as well as the necessity of safeguarding the interests of the United Kingdom. Apart from the value of our trade with Gambia itself, the colony is an obstacle in the way of a prohibitory tariff on our goods in the French Colonies. Were the duties raised too high against us in Senegal, there would arise an extensive smuggling trade via Gambia to the French hinterland, where it would be difficult to keep up an effective customs barrier. As the interior comes more and more under control, the value of Gambia in this respect will decline, but it is possibly at present a point of sufficient importance to justify our endeavouring to secure that the differential duties against us in Senegal should be abolished. Otherwise we might not only lose Gambia, but find ourselves shut out of Senegal as well, our trade with which amounts to four times as much as that with Gambia. The considerations to be demanded for the cession of Gambia might therefore include provision for— 1. Equality in the treatment of British and French goods and shipping in Senegal and Gambia for a period of thirty years, and s most-favoured-nation treatment thereafter. 2. If the foregoing should prove to be impracticable, equality for thirty years in Gambia in respect of trade and shipping, and most-favoured-nation treatment thereafter, coupled with an engagement on the part of France not to increase the existing discriminatory duties against British goods or to impose discriminatory duties against British shipping in Senegal. 3. Equal treatment, in perpetuity, for British and French subjects in Gambia. It may be noted that in 1901 an Agreement was made with France under which the frontier was modified so as to give Yarbutenda, which was at the easternmost extremity of the Colony, to France. It was agreed that, in the event of the river not being open to maritime navigation up to that point, France should have access to a landing place lower down the river, at a point to be recognized by mutual agreement, to merchant-ships engaged in maritime navigation. It is possible that in the event of the railway inland to Kayes being constructed this clause of the Agreement would become of considerable importance. IV.—THE TRADE, SHIPPING, &amp;c., OF GAMBIA. The connection of Gambia with this country is of long standing. In 1618 a Company was formed for the exploration of the River Gambia. The Treaty of Versailles (1783) assigned the Gambia (except the port of Albreda) to Britain, and the Senegal (except Portendic) to France, and in 1857 these ports were exchanged, so that the rivers became exclusively British and French respectively. Prior to 1891 the settlements on the river had an area of 69 square miles, and the outside districts formed an undefined sphere of influence. In that year there was a delimitation of frontier which assigned to the United Kingdom a strip of country extending for about 6 miles on each side of the river up to the falls of Barraconda, the country beyond being recognized as French. The area of the settlements, as already stated, is 69 square miles, and the popula tion 13,461, of whom 200 are whites. The latter are at Bathurst, which has an area of 5 square miles and a total population of 8,807. Including the Protectorate, the total area is 3,619 square miles, and the total jpopulation is estimated at 163,700 persons.V ! 3 I fll f; II ; K1 * ; ill 80 It would appear from the Report on Gambia for 1894 that it was only about this time that slave-hunting was put an end to. In explanation of the fact that the Gambia —“ undoubtedly the best waterway in this part of Africa ”—had not been turned to more advantage in the past, it is remarked that it had never been possible for the natives living on the banks of the river to follow quietly agricultural pursuits, % for the country had been “ devastated and depopulated nearly up to the very doors of Bathurst by slave-hunters and marauders, who were attracted by the waterway.” Up to 1893 the old system of trade exclusive^ by barter was carried on through numerous middlemen, who went up the river every dry season. They had hard times with marauders, but “ with these rascals cleared off, and the establishment of a civilized Government, the merchants begin to realize that they can now with safety start stores in the Protectorate, and send cash as well as goods up the river ” (Colonial Report, Gambia, 1894). It wx)uld seem, therefore, that the Protectorate was of little or no importance commercially before 1894. The River Gambia is the finest waterway on the West African coast. It is navigable for nearly 300 miles from its mouth to the falls of Barraconda. At Fattatenda, just below the falls, it has, even in the dry season, a breadth of 320 feet, and a depth of 13 to 20 feet. In the rainy season it rises 20 to 50 feet. Its mouth provides one of the few harbours on the west coast, and Bathurst is the only port in this district belonging to Great Britain until Sierra Leone is reached.

France takes practically the whole crop. u The oil is used to supplement and supplant olive oil for culinary purposes. It is a first-class lubricant. It burns well, makes first-rate soap and butterine, and the refuse after crushing is excellent feeding for cattle or manure.” In 1850-60 the exports of ground nuts from Gambia averaged 11,000 tons a-year, and in the seventies averaged 14,000 tons.

Taking the whole of French West Africa, the British share of the volume of trade is nearly 29 per cent., but in Senegal and Upper Senegal-Niger it is only 21 per cent. The commerce of Senegal is entirely in the hands of a few r long-established Bordeaux firms ; there is not a single British firm in the Colony ; the principal export—ground- jnuts—does not find a market in the United Kingdom ; and there has Always been adifferential duty of 1 per cent, against all imports not of French origin.

The Thies-Ivayes line is said to be much needed to provide rapid communication with the Soudan throughout the whole year, the present route to Kayes by the River Senegal being interrupted during the season of low water. ^ 1 he line will open up a number of fertile districts which at present produce little owing to lack of commumca- “ The route appears not to have been definitely settled but a preliminary survey has been made and a sum of 540,0001. has been provided. (Consular Report, French ^ 68 These means of communication must detract considerably from the importance of the River Gambia as a trading route to the hinterland, in so far as they provide other means of carrying goods inland. On the other hand, were Gambia to become^ French possession, it is possible that that portion of the projected railway from Thies to the easternmost portion of the British territory would be no longer necessary, and that the River Gambia would take its place, the railway starting from some point near where the river ceases to be navigable, and proceeding thence to Kayes. So far as they go, the above notes show that British trade with Senegal via Gambia is not of much importance and is not likely to develop to any great extent, while, on the other hand, the river would be of great use to France m connection with the projected railway. .. *Annex.

Settlement with France seems not impossible, whereby in return for concessions elsewhere she will withdraw from joint guarantee of Sultan’s independence and give us free hand as to arms, &amp;c. It seems essential, if French withdrawal is to benefit us, that we should secure from Sultan control over his foreign relations, an undertaking that he will follow our advice regarding arms traffic, and possibly other conditions which you may consider of equal importance. It is clear that unless Sultan is pledged to these before the withdrawal of France is accomplished, he may raise difficulties, and that we may fail to obtain value for price paid for French withdrawal. Actual negotiations with France have not begun ; they will take some time and may possibly come to nothing. Meanwhile, I should be glad to know your views as to the terms of any agreement with the Sultan and the procedure for ensuring his assent to them. Till these points are settled between us, matter should be kept secret and nothing said to the Sultan about the proposed negotiations with him or France. Please reply early. From Viceroy, 5th August 1908. Foreign Secret. Maskat. Your telegram of 22nd ultimo. Following from Cox, 30th July :— “Your telegram No. 431 S., dated 23rd July. Para. 1. The treaty of commerce between Maskat and United States, especially clause referring to arms, and fact that they maintain Consul at Maskat, seem to constitute difficulty, and although attitude of United States at Brussels Conference may afford His Majesty’s Government reason to think it is not serious one, yet, in any case, United States Government will presumably have to be communi cated with, and perhaps placated. As regards Netherlands, nature of their commercial declaration hardly seems to give them claim to be consulted. “ Para. 2. I do not think any arrangement by which his income or his prestige as an independent ruler will be reduced will be willingly accepted by Sultan, and if we discuss proposed arrangement with him in advance, it is conceivable that certain persons among his subjects, or interested foreigners like Goguyer, may persuade him to induce United States to object, or even to invite German Government to conclude commercial treaty and appoint Consul. “ Para. 3. The best course which I can suggest is that, having pro visionally obtained France and United States consent to the withdrawal of their Consuls, and the consignment of their interests to our care, we should inform Sultan accordingly, and explain to him that the heavy responsibility which we have taken upon ourselves before the Powers at the Brussels Conference in connection with arms traffic obliged us, with the concurrence of France and United States, to insist on his prohibiting the import trade of arms and ammunition and allowing us to supervise his Customs ; but that in consideration of his friendly acceptance of these measures, and in return for an undertaking on his part to make no more treaties, and to entrust his foreign relations to us, we propose to increase his subsidy to such and such a figure, and agree to leave him to conduct the internal administration of Oman as heretofore. Any arms and ammunition required by His Highness for legitimate purposes of administration would be imported for him by us. Supervision of Customs by us is of utmost importance if we are to deal with arms traffic effectively.” We concur generally in Cox’s views, especially as regards importance of control of Customs. In return for Sultan’s acquiescence in proposed measures, and as compensation for loss of duty on arms, we should be prepared to pay whatever sum may hereafter be found by negotiation to be necessary. Presumably agreement with Sultan would be in the ordinary form of protectorate treaty with the trucial Chiefs, with special clauses relating to Customs supervision and prohibition of arms traffic, as suggested by Cox. It is of greatest importance to keep negotiations secret, as Sultan will undoubtedly resent them, and may seek protection elsewhere.V No. 3447, dated Rushire, tlie 6fch Decemlter 1908 (Secret).

In the course of a letter to me from home, dated 23th October, Major Grey sends me some comment on the subject-matter of these telegrams. I find that his views differ considerably from mine, and in case there may be in his mind or mine any misconception of the position, or of the considerations which prompted the Secretary of State’s telegram of 22nd July to the Government of India, it seems advisable for me to forward a copy of the passage in Major Grey’s letter referred to, and to add some further observations in explanation of the views previously communicated to Government. 3. Stated succinctly the opinion I expressed was that it would be best to wait until we had in our pocket the abrogation of the Declaration of 1862 by France, and the acquiescence of the Republic and of other Powers concerned, in the stoppage of the import of arms into Maskat, and then to proceed to impose upon the Sultan such changes as seemed necessary for the accomplish ment of our purpose, thus making one operation of the measure. Major Grey, after giving me the news elsewhere in his letter, that the acquiescence of'all the interested Powers, except France, in the suppression of the import of arms into Maskat had been secured, advocates that we should at once approach the Sultan with a view to obtaining from him an under taking to give us control of his foreign relations before any rumours are afloat in Maskat regarding our arrangement with hrance. He recommends, on the other hand, that the question of the closure of Maskat to the arms traffic should not. be broached until the matter of foreign relations is satisfactorily arranged. The solution of the problem resolves itself into an appraisement of relative probabilities, and is clearly one about which considerable divergence of view may reasonably exist. 4. In arriving at the conclusions expressed in my telegram of 30th July, I was prompted by the following line of reasoning : it is clear from the terms of the Secretary of State’s telegram that the project for effecting an arrange ment with France is at present only in embryo. The possibility of its proving completely abortive is specifically entertained. This being so, it would seem to be of doubtful expediency for us to show our hand to the Sultan (and to his chief advisers) now ; for in the event of the scheme falling through we should have needlessly exposed our ultimate intentions towards Maskat and the Sultan, and snould be placed in an unpleasant position in consequence. The fact is, according to my idea, that any communication whatever that we might now make to His Highness in the direction of inviting him to entrust the official control of his foreign relations to us, or to agree to the closure of Maskat to the import of arms, can, in his eyes, be nothing else than a constructive intimation to the effect that we have squared France in regard to both matters, or are in a position to do so. 5. Reverting to the question of foreign relations, it is my belief that His Highness is fully alive to the signification of the Joint Declaration of 1862 in which the British and French Governments engaged to respect his independ ence : he well knows that by virtue of that declaration it has been held in the past that France and ourselves are internationally on an equal footing at Maskat. Consequently, if a proposal of the nature contemplated regarding his foreign relations were made to him, he would at once see that it could not have been made and would have no meaning, unless the abrogation of the Declaration of 1862 had been pre-arranged or could be counted upon by us. In the absence of such pre-arrangement, in making such overtures we should2 be just as much reckoning without our host vis-a-vis France, as France would he if her representative at Maskat were to make a confidential request to the Sultan to agree to entrust his foreign relations to the Republic. 6 . Similarly in the matter of the arms traffic. The attitude which the Sultan has always seemed to me ostensibly to affect has been that he was quite ready to co-operate with us as far as he was able to check the illicit export to the opposite coast, but seeing that he was precluded by treaty from restrietino- the import of arms into Maskat and could take no effective measures in that direction, he might as well derive what profit he could from the import while it lasted. Any definite proposal which we made to him having for its object the closure of Maskat altogether to the import of arms and ammunition must clearly make him aware that we had secured or could secure the consent of France to the modification of Article 11 of her Commercial Treaty with him, and also the promise of the other Powers concerned to agree to* the entire stoppage of the trade to his territory. 7. Furthermore, it seems unreasonable to suppose that the Sultan would give an immediate and off-hand reply to our overtures in either connection. Certainly it would be contrary to past experience of him. I should expect him to ask for time to consider the question at leisure and to consult his brother, his sons, and other confidential advisers: it would then, I am con vinced, he exceedingly difficult to prevent the news of our intentions becoming public property in Maskat, and there is a large section of influential subject! of His Highness, who are very strongly interested in the arms traffic, ’ and others, who fear that many convenient privileges which they now enjovfrom the Ruler of Maskat would cease or be curtailed if the control of the British assumed any more definite shape. These people certainly constitute a factor which would have to he reckoned with in the event of any lengthy warning reaching them of what was coming. ° o. vv im regard to tne conjecture as to how the Sultan would receive our overtures on either question. Major Grey’s observations hearing on his own experience and mine, of His Highness’s habit of consulting us in reference to his relations with foreign representatives, are true enough as far as they go but do not seem to me to go far enough. It will be remembered that for some time previous to 1899 Seyyid Feisal had been in the habit of using the French Consul as adviser and letter-drafter in his difficulties and important communi cations with us. Since 1899 the reverse has been the case, as it always should be if we play our cards properly; but for the Sultan to take the friendly counsel of the British Government or its representative, sub rosa, in his dealings with other Powers, with whom he can then proceed to communicate as an independent ruler, is a very different position from that presented by his placing his official foreign relations entirely in our hands. Such a course must clearly affect his position and prestige in his own mind and that of his subjects to a considerable degree, and knowing well what a fetich these attributes are with Arab potentates in the Persian Gulf, I feel that we must expect the Sultan to appreciate the significance of our overtures and to he moved thereby. . A ® r 5 ards the arms question, I think it may be presumed that His Highness fully expects and fears that the Conference will have some result m the direction of putting an end to the free import to Maskat and am inclined to think that if he were told that it was the decision of the Powers assembled at the Conference that the import to Maskat must be stopped altogether he would see no other course than to accept the inevitable with as much com posure as he could command, however much he might dislike it At the samo time he would no doubt look to us, his good friends, to compensate him to ^ reasonable extent for the loss of revenue, and if we did not do so both he and his subjects would undoubtedly nurse a chronic grievance against us 10 My remark that it was conceivable that His Highness* might be induced to safeguard his independence or the continuance of the arms trade by making use of the United States or Germany, was made at a time when i! was quite uncertain what attitude those Powers would adopt at the Conference3 and I mentioned the contingency as a conceivable and not a probable one. In any case it is much discounted now if, as I gather from Major Grey, the attitude of both Powers proved favourable to our policy. 11. With regard to the proposed supervision by us of the Sultan’s Customs, if an arrangement for the absolute stoppage of the import into Maskat is achieved at the Conference, the question of the control of the CustJms becomes of less pressing importance, and might he kept in abeyance until we see how far the Sultan s own arrangements succeed in maintaining the prohibition effective. 12 . On the whole I am inclined generally to adhere to the views ex pressed by me in July, namely, that we should, if possible, reserve our com munications to the Sultan both in regard to his foreign relations and the arms traffic until the results of the Brussels Conference and the success of the negotiations with Prance are sufficiently assured to enable us to do so confi dently. I think it would be possible, now tbat the general trend of the proceedings of the Conference is known to us, to make our request to the Sultan on the subject of the arms traffic forthwith with reasonable chance of success, simply because he would suppose tliat we should not make such a definite proposal unless we were confident of a successful result to the Conference. But I myself incline to the belief that the less time we give His Highness to think about either matter the better. • The questions involved are of such importance that I trust I shall be pardoned for discussing the position at s ich length. Extract from a letter from Major W. G. Grey to Major P. Z. Cox, dated from England, 2Sth October 1908. ******* I have seen the Secretary of State’s telegram to India regarding the proposals to obtain from vhe Sultan of Maskat undertakings to hand over to us the control of .his foreign relations, and to fall in with any view we meffit express regarding the cessation of the arms traffic (on conditions, no doubt); and the Government of India’s reply, referring to your views. My own opinion is that it would be better to approach the Sultan at once in connection with the first undertaking, as I think, he would make the promise fairly readily. He has always brought to you and to me any difficulty concerning a foreign Power, and even, I think, any letter from a foreign representative ; and seems to regard us as his natural protectors in that sense, as a matter of course. It does not seem likely to me that he would make much difficulty about promising it even in writing, to do what as a matter of fact, he has always done for a considerable time. The arms traffic question is very different, and will be more difficult. I think it should be dealt with after Ho. 1 has been settled. In any case No. 1 should be taken in hand before any rumours as to a settlement with Prance are about in Maskat. I am not at all sure that I agree with you as to the probability or even possibility of the 8ultan asking for the help of any Power against us. I have always thought that he is now too much bound to us to play any pranks of that sort. ******* Foreign Office Press—No. 280—2-2«0£—36- rAuflL*' From Viceroy, 5th August 1908.

On the other hand, if these negotiations fail, the Pi end Government could, as in the case of the General Act of the Brussels Conference of 1890 withhold their assent to the Articles to which they object.

Inclosure in No. 1. British Plenipotentiaries to Sir Edward Grey. jUtStidr) (No. 19.

Uiey did not reject the principle of an exchange of the Gambia, but they held that the consideration offered was inadequate. If the French Government were prepared to receive further proposals from that of His Majesty the latter would state their views, but it would take them some little time to frame their proposals, and m the meanwhile we proposed that the Conference should continue its labours and draw np a drait Ac , which could be agreed on immediately, subject to reservations, and could be signed in the autumn by all the Powers, if the Anglo-French negotiations succeeded; whilst i they failed, the French Government could, as in the case of the General Act, withho d its assent to the Articles to which it objected. # . Count d’Ormesson asked if we could give him privately and unofficially any hint as to the further demands which you proposed_ to make, and whether they wo aid be discussed between the two Governments in Paris or in London. Sir Arthur Hardinge said he was not authorized to indicate their nature, but that he thought you would, prefer London to Paris as the scene of their discussion, inasmuch as m connection with the transfer of the Gambia alone a good many questions of detail, such, for instance, as the rights and interests of the native population, the position of Moussa Mollah, &amp;c., would have to be settled, and this could be more conveniently done m London. It was evident from the manner in which the French Delegates received 0111 i e P y that they were by no means dissatisfied with it. They said that the questions of detai to which Sir Arthur Hardinge had referred would be dealt with by them m the most conciliatory spirit ; and they agreed to our proposal respecting the Conference. M. Lecomte, however, suggested that the draft Article about Muscat (copy oi which we had the honour to inclose in our despatch No. 120 of the 27th May) should not figure m the body of the Act, as it was a dangerous precedent to let an International Conterence legislate respecting separate Treaties between independent Powers. ^ They would pielei an Article taking note of a declaration, to be annexed to the Additional Act, by which the five Powers having Treaties with Muscat renounced such rights as those latter gave them in respect of the arms traffic. We said, in reply to this suggestion^ that to us personally it seemed a question merely of form, and that we would submit it lor youh approval eco^te on |( . speak of tlle objection made by the Turkish Government to the inclusion of Tripoli in the zone of prohibition, -which has evidently rather [1810 ff —2] i ! - V2 disconcerted the French ; and he mentioned that they had intended proposing the establishment of one of the contemplated international bureaux at Tripoli of Barbary itself. Sir Arthur Hardinge expressed the opinion that the Turks would be very unwilling to see an international bureau, which to them suggested a pretext for further Consular interference in their domestic administration, established anywhere in Ottoman territory. But for this peculiarity of the Turkish mind he would have proposed Jeddah as the seat of a Red Sea Bureau; only he had felt that any such suggestion would have frightened the Porte, and perhaps led it to oppose the extension's of the zone to Arabia. M. Lecomte agreed, but said that he thought that the three European Governments having interests of paramount importance in Tripoli, viz., Italy, France, and ourselves, might instruct their Consuls at Tripoli and Benghazi to watch and inform one another respecting the importation of arms through that part of the Mediterranean coast of Africa, whence large consignments reached Wadai and Kanem, and perhaps also Darfur. We agreed also that it would be desirable that the Powers interested should use their influence at Constantinople to induce the Porte to consent to the inclusion of Tripoli in the zone, since it was useless to hope that the Turkish Charge d’Affaires at Brussels would have sufficient courage in voicing them for any views which we might impress on him to carry weight with his own Government. We further agreed that at the meeting of the Conference next Tuesday Sir Arthur Hardinge should announce that an exchange of views between the British and French Governments on the question of Muscat, though it had not yet had any definite results, had made it possible, in the opinion of the British delegation, for the Conference to proceed to draft a series of new Articles, on the assumption that an entente might eventually be reached, and that Count d’Ormesson should intimate his concurrence in this view. AVe would then proceed to settle, in conference, the terms of the draft, and when they were agreed upon all round (subject to reservations on certain points by the French), adjourn till the 1st October, or, if we were not ready by then, to a later but definite date to be subsequently fixed. After the conclusion of our discussion with the French, we went on to the Italian Legation. AVe explained to Count Bonin, without, of course, going into details, that the French were prepared to meet our and his views about Muscat in return for the settlement of certain outstanding questions in other parts of the world between ourselves and them, and we described the procedure which we and they proposed to follow as regards the continuance of the Conference’s work. He declared himself ready to fall in with this programme, and showed us a draft “Additional Act” embodying the various proposals of his Government, which he intended to submit to the Conference and which we are now examining. He stated that he was authorized to abandon his original proposal to include Tripoli in the zone, but we told him that while we thought there would be no harm in his informing the French Delegates of this piivately, it would be better not to let the Turks know it, so as not to weaken the effect of the representations which the three Governments might make at Constantinople, and which Germany might perhaps be persuaded to support there, especia y ilk ranee could be induced to accept some of the special German proposals which she had up to now opposed. AA 7 e may mention that in the course of our conversation with the French we urged, we think not quite ineffectually, the expediency ot meeting the Germans half-way on the liquor question, respecting which the French attitude is at present unyielding. The result of our interviews since our return here leads us to be fairly hopeful as to a satisfactory settlement of the mam questions which have led to the summoning of le onference, provided we are able to arrive at an understanding with France with respect to the wider political issues involved.

Memorandum by the British Plenipotentiaries. THE Erencli Delegates to the Arms Conference at Brussels have informed their British colleagues that they have been authorized by their Government to mahe the following proposal:— The Trench Government would allow r His Majesty’s Government a free hand to do what they liked in Muscat in the same way as Great Britain some years ago gave Trance full liberty of action in Tunis and Madagascar —i e., to establish a Protectorate or, indeed, direct political control over the Sultanate of Oman ; and they would further agree to the zone of prohibition for the traffic in arms and ammunition being extended along the shores of Arabia as far as the southern limit of Muscat; Great Britain would, in return, cede the Gambia to Trance. The Trench Delegates added that, though they had not actually been empowered to discuss the matter, they thought they might say that their Government would be prepared, further, to consider favourably the question of a revision of the existing Trench Treaty with Zanzibar. The question therefore now arises whether this proposal should be accepted. It will he convenient to discuss it under two heads: (a) the value of what the Trench offer to us, in which for purposes of argument, may he included the revision of the Trench Treaty with Zanzibar; and (b) the price which they propose to ask. (a.) It is hardly necessary here to expatiate on the importance which has long been attached—and at no time, perhaps, more than of recent years—to the main tenance of British ascendency in the Persian Gulf; and all the considerations under lying the reference to our interests in this quarter which are contained in the despatch to His Majesty’s Ambassador at St. Petersburg!! of the 29th August last* apply equally, according to the sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence which has been considering the question, to Muscat, which occupies a commanding position at the entrance to the Gulf. Indeed, so important is Muscat that it may be said that, while without it it would be impossible to keep our hold on the Gulf, with it the control of the Gulf would cease to be so absolutely necessary to us as has hitherto been the case. Even apart, however, from its high value as a political asset, Muscat is far from being worthless from an economical point of view. It has an area of 81,000 square miles and a population of 1,000,000. Muscat itself possesses an excellent harbour, and its trade amounted in 1905-6 to 550,000/., and should certainly grow enormously once the political conditions assumed a more stable character. Such as it is, however, 83 per cent, is with England and India, and 92 per cent, of the shipping is British. At present it is true that our influence with the Sultan is stronger than that of the Trench, but their position under their Treaty of 1814 is quite strong enough to enable them, if they so choose, to embarrass us very considerably. Indeed, quite recently, the use to which they put their rights in the country caused our relations with them to be subjected to a serious strain. The appointment of a Trench Consul in 1894 was followed by the Concession to the Trench Government of a coaling station at Bunder Giseh, a harbour 5 miles from the tow r n of Muscat, and the contro versy that arose over this transaction was only terminated in 1899 by our compelling the Sultan under threat of bombardment to cancel the Concession and to abandon other practices obnoxious to British interests. The coaling station incident was followed by dispute arising from the action of the Trench Government in issuing flags to Muscat dhows and claiming that their owners and crews thereby came under Trench protection and were excluded from the Sultan’s jurisdiction. We protested against this abuse of the Trench flag, and the dispute became so acute that in 1905 it was found necessary to submit it to arbitration at The Hague. The Award was such as to prevent in future the creation by Trance, by the abuse of the flag, of * See “Russia, No. 1,” 1907. [1810 y—2] B2 any large colony of French-protected citizens, hut the French have nevertheless asserted their right to grant protection to the employes of French citizens resident in Muscat. This right has not, indeed, so far been exercised in any objectionable manner, but it is obviously open to abuses which may at anytime created a difficulty such as that which led to the arbitration in 1905. But it is not only on the Treaty of 1844 that rests the power which the French possess of embarrassing us : there is also the joint Declaration of 1862, by which both countries bound themselves to respect the independence of the Sultanate. Under the terms of that Declaration the French would consider themselves entitled to object if, as we wish to do, we succeeded in persuading the Sultan to place his customs under our control; as also if we desired for any reason to increase the allowance which we at present make to His Highness. The foregoing remarks seem sufficient to show, in the first place, of what im portance it is to this country to maintain a predominant position at Muscat; and, in the second, how easy it is for the French to render that position a matter of uncertainty, thanks to the Treaty of 1844 and the Anglo-French Declaration of 1862. If their present offer is accepted the French would abandon both these instruments, and merely accept in return most-favoured-nation treatment. It is not only, however, in regard to France that our position at Muscat will, by the acceptance of the French offer, be rendered unassailable; it will also make it so as far as other countries are concerned. At present the only other Governments besides our own and the French which have Treaties with Muscat are Portugal, the United States, and the Netherlands, and their Agreements are of a purely commercial nature. Once, therefore, we were free so far as France was concerned, it would he possible for us to get the Sultan to sign an Agreement to the effect that he would place his foreign relations in our hands and so prevent any other country from establishing a footing in the place. That this danger is far from being imaginary can be seen from the fact that quite recently the Italians expressed a great desire to establish a Consulate at Muscat, and it was only by making an appeal to their friendly relations with us that we were able to induce them to abandon their project. A far more serious danger, however, threatens us in connection with the Germans. The German Government has recently displayed a desire to play a role in the Persian Gulf, no doubt in connection with their Bagdad Bailway. They have already subsidized a line of steamers to Bushire, which calls at Muscat, and at any moment we may he confronted with the fact of a German demand for the establishment of Consular relations with Muscat—a step which would only too probably lead to the Germans proceeding to try and play a role in the politics of Arabia and to create there a situation similar to that now existing in Morocco. The second Article in the French offer would he the inclusion of the Arabian coast as far as the frontier of Muscat in the zone of prohibition, which, it may be observed, is also the second of the two items in the British programme of the Arms Conference to which the chief importance is attached, the first being the placing of the Sultan of Muscat in such a position as will enable him to prohibit the importation of arms and ammunition into his dominions. At present the French, while observing the provisions of the Brussels Act icspecting the exportation of arms and ammunition in regard to places within the zone, have always refused to consider themselves as under any obligation in regard to their passage to places outside. It is acting on this principle that they allow the tree expoit of arms from Jibuti to the opposite shore of the Arabian Sea. The British elegates at the Conference have made repeated efforts to move them from this position, as they have also done to endeavour to get their consent to waiving that a V.? i 1C ^ renc h Treaty with Muscat which prohibits the imposition of a higher duty than 5 per cent., and thus prevent the Sultan stopping the trade in arms and ammunition by imposing a heavy duty on these articles. In the first case, the French e e 0 a es icp.y t iat they are under no legal obligation to prevent arms going from places within the zone to places without, and they altogether decline to accept the inirng on this point which was given by Baron Lambermont, the President of the first Brussels Conference and which is directly contrary to the view held by t lem and with regard to the trade in arms and ammunition with Muscat, which for the most part is conducted with that port direct from Europe, they maintain f y. ^ 1 ™ a ^ e &gt; an d that the French interests involved are too important- to a low of their giving them up without compensation. it, however, the French once agree to the inclusion of the Arabian coastwithin the zone of prohibition, they will he hound to prevent the exportation, thither of arms and ammunition from Jibuti, and in fact the trade of that place in these articles will, ipso facto, disappear, since there will no longer he any port in the ^Neighbourhood to which arms could be legitimately exported, and any vessel found ~vvith any on board would practically, by the mere fact of their presence, be guilty of smuggling. The Government of India and the Somaliland Administration have for some years past been put to heavy and increasing expenditure in the vain effort to stop the arms traffic, which, in spite of their efforts, grows daily. There can be no doubt that, with the trade cut off at its two sources—Muscat and Jibuti—the expenses incurred under this head will rapidly diminish. The last item in the French offer, if we may count it, is the expression of their readiness to consider the question of the revision of their Treaty with Zanzibar (including the 10-mile zone in British East Africa). This, it is true, is not a very important point, since some of its most objectionable features have disappeared within the last few years; but, though the removal from the Treaty of several Articles which embarrass us in connection with our plans for the better government of the Sultanate may not perhaps be an object which in itself it is worth much sacrifice to attain, there is no doubt that the continued existence of the Articles referred to is a source of a good deal of friction and much acrimonious correspondence, and their disappearance, if only on this ground, is greatly to be desired. (&amp;.) To come now to the consideration of the price which the French ask us for these advantages, the cession, that is, of the Gambia. Into this consideration two elements enter: (a) the value of the Gambia to the French and (&amp;) its value to us. There can be no doubt about the first. It is shown by the frequency with which they have put forward proposals for its cession. On the last occasion, in 1903-4 y they proposed its cession as part of the compensation which they demanded in return for giving up their rights in Newfoundland. Lord Lansdowne finally informed the French Ambassador (the 25th January, 1904) that he and his colleagues “ had come to the conclusion that it would be impossible to defend the abandonment of an old British Colony which had been British long before the French had occupied the surrounding country.” Nor is it difficult to see why the French would be glad to get the Gambia into their hands. By so doing they would secure for themselves not only a territory of some 4,000 to 5,000 square miles which at present forms an inconvenient enclave in their West African possessions, but an excellent seaport and a waterway which is unique in Africa. Unlike all other African rivers, the Gambia has neither delta nor bar to obstruct navigation. It is no less than 27 miles across at the mouth and 2^ miles wide at Bathurst, the capital. It is safe to enter, as there is never less than 26 feet of water, and it is navigable for some 150 miles by steamers drawing 12 feet, and for some 80 miles farther by vessels of 10 feet draught. But while the Colony would undoubtedly be an extremely valuable acquisition, to the French province of Senegambia, its value to us can hardly be considered great. It has no doubt a certain trade. In 1906 the imports and exports combined were valued at 876,000/., and in 1907 no less than 453,800 tons of shipping entered and cleared, but 408,000/. out of the total 4 28,000/., which is the annual value of the exports, go elsewhere than to the United Kingdom, and less than half the imports come from this country, while of the five principal firms only one is British, three of the others being French and one German. It is, indeed, the only British West African Colony in which Liverpool can be said to be but little if at all interested. Moreover, owing to the fact that except near the mouth it is merely a strip of territory about 7 miles wide on either side of the river, it is out of the question that its prosperity can ever increase. If, however, its positive value to us can never be expected to be greater than it is at present, its value as an element of barter must grow smaller. The French in the first place have long been talking of' building a railway more or less parallel with the river; once they have done so, once they have spent their money, and trade has grown accustomed to its new channel, they will naturally not be disposed to give us so much for the Colony as they would now. Further, there can be little doubt that if we refuse their present overtures they will lose no time in insisting on the fulfilment of Article 5 of the Agreement of the 8th April, 1904, which hitherto they have allowed to sleep. [1810 y —2] B 24 That Article runs as follows :— “Article 5. “ The present frontier between Senegambia and the English Colony of the Gambit shall be modified so as to give to Erance Yarbutenda and the lands and landing places belonging to the locality. “In the event of the river not being open to maritime navigation up to that point, access shall be assured to the Erench Government at a point lower down on the Elver Gambia, which shall be recognized by mutual agreement as being accessible to merchant-ships engaged in maritime navigation. “ The conditions which shall govern transit on the Eiver Gambia and its tributaries, as well as the method of access to the point that may be reserved to Erance in accordance with the preceding paragraph, shall form the subject of future agreement between the two Governments. “ In any case, it is understood that these conditions shall be at least as favour able as those of the system instituted by application of the General Act of the African Conference of the 25th Eebruary, 1885, and of the Anglo-Erench Con vention of the 14th June, 1898, to the English portion of the basin of the Niger.” And it will be seen that these terms, if carried out, would leave the value to us of the Gambia seriously diminished, if not altogether destroyed. There would of course be a certain sentimental objection to parting with a Colonv which has belonged to this country ever since the time of James I, but the value o*f this long association is somewhat discounted by the fact that it was originally founded for the purpose of carrying on the Slave Trade, while it certainly cannot be con tended that there is any such sentiment attaching to it as there is, for instance, to the much more recent acquisitions of Gibraltar or Malta. Lord Lansdowne, in his answer to the French Ambassador, already quoted, speaks of the Gambia as “having been British long before the Erench occupied the surrounding country.” This is undoubtedly the case, but the fact is one which would seem not so much to show that we ought to desire to retain it still, as that we could never have attached much importance to it, since, far from seeking to extend its area, we have allowed it absolutely to be shut in on every side by the French. Of course, in any negotiations for cession which it may be decided to enter upon it will be necessary that, in addition to securing an adequate quid pro quo, we should also make such arrangements as will prevent the Erench from levying* differential duties in the adjacent territories. So long as Great Britain holds' the Gambia like a wedge driven into the adjacent Erench Colonies, so long is it almost impossible for the Erench to close the Senegal trade to us, and we must not allow that w edge to be removed without taking steps to prevent the Erench depriving us of such portion of that trade as we now enjoy. It w'ould doubtless be possible to stipulate, as was done in the Anglo-French Convention of the 14th June, 1898, that no disci iminating oi prohibitive duties should be levied for a period of vears to be agreed upon. Arrangements would also have to be concluded for safeguarding the interests both of the European and native inhabitants. There are, for instance, tile officials, both white and coloured, to be considered, of whom there are about 160, drawing salanes^ amounting to about 26,000/. a-year ; there are twenty-three nersons in receipt o pensions which come to about 1,000/. a-year; there are missionary and educational establishments Roman Catholic, Anglican, and Wesleyan, whose interests must not be forgotten, and, lastly, there are the natives, who are said to dislike the Erench, and more especially some important Chiefs, such as Moussa Mollah, whose extradition JolitlraTrefre? 7 French ’ but refu ^d by us on the ground that he was a eon si dp vp &lt;1 m ,° l re , ol, i e ction to the proposed bargain which remains to be considered. _ It is this . that whereas the Erench would be giving us only certain m angiole rights, we on our side should be giving them a real tangible property.

A In conclusion, it may be observed that to come to such an arrangement with the 'rench as that indicated above would he merely to follow up the policy we have now for some time past been pursuing-that, namely, of endeavouring to remove all possible sources of friction between the two countries Muscat is a thorn m our flesh; the Gambia in that of France—they would both be got lld of \ regularization of our position at Muscat hy means of an Agreement with the French would, moreover, form a very suitable corollary to the recent regularization of our position in Persia hy means of an Agreement with Russia. , , , f It will, perhaps, not be amiss to consider the position which will he created it W6 1 There^is no^doubf that, if reasons of general policy did not render it advisable for us to remain on good terms with the French, there are elements m their Treaty with Muscat of 1844 and in our position in the Sultanate which would enable to put considerable difficulties in the way of the trade in arms and ammunition now done there by them ; but this could certainly only he at the expense of great friction, and cannot therefore be considered as a practical expedient. , , It seems quite hopeless to move the French from the attitude they have ta e up in regard to the extension of the zone and the modification of their Treaty with Muscat 3 The British delegation at Brussels have exhausted every possible argument, both in public and in private, and the only result of the recent appeal they made for the assistance of the Home Government at Bans has been the P^sent prop^al It seems useless, therefore, to expect that any change will he produced n the athtude the French Government, even by the obvious danger they will inn wreckin'* the Conference altogether or at least of being the one Power that refuses to sign 'the Convention which it is hoped may he the result of its labours. A ' c mav incidentally be remarked that a Convention to which France was not a party would be of very little practical value. The traffic in arms and ammunition from Muscat to tl.e north-western frontier of India, and from Jibuti via Arabia to Somaliland will therefore continue to grow as it has been doing for the last . vears • and’ simultaneously the Article in the shape of the Gambia, for which the French have asked in return for putting a stop to that traffic, will gradually lose its value.

WE have the honour to report, in continuation of our last preceding despatch, that we had an interview with the French Delegnfis at their Legation yester ay Count d’Ormesson opened the conversation by recapitulating the main features of the Muscat question, and said that, inasmuch as French political as well as private hut important commercial interests were at stake, France expected a centre narlie ” the precise nature of which might be discussed later, m return tor her aban donment of a Treaty right, to which French public opinion attached a perhaps sentimental but nevertheless very real importance. _ Sir Arthur Hardinge asked, for his personal information, where the political interests of the French Government, as distinct from the commercial ones of French traders such as M. Goguyer, came in, and the French Delegates replied that le extension of the zone to the southern limit of Oman, which we had asked, would involve a serious loss to the Budget of the Jibuti Colony. That Colony lived on the arms traffic with Abyssinia as well as Arabia, and the acceptance by France ot our and the Italian proposals would mean an annual loss to the French Colonial Ori of about 400,000 fr. (16,0001.), which would have to be made good by the Fiench Parll Sir Arthur nardinge expressed doubts as to the injurious effect on the Jibuti gun trade of the prohibition of the arms traffic in Oman, pointing out that most of the arms from Europe went direct to Muscat without touching at Jibuti, and he again pressed the French Delegates to give us some idea of what they really wantec Lecomte, answering for Count d'Ormesson then asked how we P^P^d to compensate Sevyid Feysul, whom M. Laronee, the French Consul at Muscat, represented as averse from any interference by us with the gun trade, for the loss o thiAar^c receipts accruing to him from the duty upon arms M e might, no doubt increase the amount of the annual sum which the Government of India paid him, as a consTouence of its intervention in the succession quarrels of Seyyid Thwain-bm- Said and his brother, Seyyid Majid, but the practical f^ct °t s uch^ Viceroy of India could keep back at Ins pleasure, would be that ^ey^icl le^sui become absolutely dependent on Great Britain, and that France would have sacrificed her political and commercial interests in Oman without getting a quid pro quo. Such im arrangement would be difficult to defend in the French Parliament ' jould regard it as an inadequate equivalent for the surrender of all French political and commercial interests m tbe Sultanate. # , o' a ji M Lecomte then proceeded, in reply to certain questions by Sir v inr Hardino-e, to suggest that tbe “ contre-partie ” might be the cession to I ranee of the Gambia^ Colony in return for her abandonment of the Reclaranon of ..862, line ei which both Governments agreed to maintain tbe independence the Albusam d nasty in Oman and Zanzibar. If England would give Trance the Gambia, liance would throw over the independence, guaranteed by her m 1862, of the Suitan of Muscat, and would give us a free hand in that State-m other words the French proposed that, in return for our surrender of the Gambia, they should caned the Declaration of 1862 and let us do what we liked with Oman. Mr. Clarke asked whether this arrangement would include a revision of the Treaty o^ 1814, m so ar as it affected Zanzibar and M. Lecomte, while stating that their instructions did not authorize them to discuss this point, seemed to indicate that its inclusion would be possible.

The french Delegates were evidently very anxious that the adjournment should not have the appearance of a rupture of our discussions on a vital question of principle, and in order to attenuate any impression3 impression of this nature they prepared to devote the remain~ der of to-day 1 s sitting to the discussion of subsidiary matters, as yet imperfectly thrashed out.

It was uccorr ng &amp;ec!&lt;Uu3( to devote tlie remainder of the forenoon to a further exchange of views in Committee on the attributes and sites of the Int i national Bureaux, and the upshot of this talk was a general agreement that Aden would be the best place for the Bast Coast, and that hough Zanzibar was a too far to the South, the Slave I'rdde Bureau chore night, with the machinery at its disposal, a sist in th collection of statistic© in the part of the zone lying Souik of the Equator or of Cape Cu&amp;rdafui. ¥o decision was come to about the -eat Coast Bureau: the German :vblister doubted its necessity, but Bir Arthur Harding© said he at ached importance to its* establish ment • It remains for us U- - it to you certain I ****** as to the course to be adopted in presence of this latest rove on the part of the Trench. Our ultimate attitude will naturally depend inja great measure on theirs with regard to the extension of the zone, but it hardly seems necessary that the tan days which must elapse before this becomes known should be altogether wasted, and we could accordingly re comment-that the question of Muscat should be broched as 30 on as possible cither through the French Ambassador in London which would perhaps be preferable, or through Bir ranci3 Bertie in Paris.

Monsieur Laronce has issued a circular to the arms merchants connected with his administration forbidding them to sell to Afghans. The party of the latter which arrived on the 13th instant (the first to arrive this season) included some of the persons to whom Monsieur Goguyer had given assistance last year; and these pro ceeded at once to his establishment on being released from quarantine. Monsieur Goguyer however told them that he couldooulSL do nothing .further to help them. This arrangement is satisfactory so far as it goes, hut there is still the danger of these Afghans acquiring arms through a third person. As soon as the Sultan returns from the Pirate Coast I will try to induce him to press them to leave Muscat, and to act in a similar manner in connection with any further parties that may arrive. 4.

I have the honour to refer to the correspondence ending with my letter No. K.- 4 , and its enclosures, dated Karachi, 21 st September 1907 , in connection with an enquiry which the French Consul at Maskat has made regarding the assistance given by Monsieur Goguyer to Afghan arms traders. 2. During a private conversation which I had with Monsieur Laronce two days ago he informed me that it had come to his knowledge, though not yet officially, that M. Goguyer had already put in a defence to the charges brought against him, the main point of which was that he had never neard that the importation of arms into Baluchistan and Afghanistan was forbidden. 3 . The personal dislike which M. Laronce has for this person largely in fluences him in his actions regarding him, and possibly, from the French aspect of the case, M. Goguyer will not be found guilty of anything more than an act of distinct unfriendliness to a nation with whom a strong entente exists. But whatever he may say in his defence it is unquestionable that he knew perfectly well that the importation of arms and ammunition into Persian limits had been forbidden by the Persian Government, and that he could scarcely have imagined a more unfriendly act to us than the encouragement of Afghans in their purchase of these articles. 4 . You will have observed that one of my objects in putting forward the conduct of M. Goguyer in this matter was the possibility which its consideration bv the French Government would subsequently afford me of bringing pressure to bear upon His Highness the Sultan with a view to preventing his subjects also from selling arms to Afghan and Baluchis. It will be seen that I could not do this without first having caused such action to be taken in connection with those arms merchants who are under Foreign control. 5 . I venture to hope that His Majesty’s Government may be able, subject of course to any other measures which may be under consideration, to obtain from that of the French a promise that M. Laronce may be instructed to restrain • Fii* telegram from Political Agent, Maskat, Mm. Goguyer, Baijeot, araca a ^ dated the 13 th November 1907 .

He took a voyage in the boom captained by Nakhoda Abdullah bin Ghanem, an inhabitant of Koweit, to Hodeida in Yemen with a cargo of dates. After leaving Hodeida they proceeded to Jibutil, a. French Port, and shipped there 600 cases rifles called Dixon, each case containing 12 rifles, and 400 cases cart' ridges. The rifles belonged to certain men, ( 1 ) named Seif bin Abdulla, an inhabitant of Koweit, ( 2 ) Abdul Rahman bin Salman an inhabitant of Bahmashir, and ( 3 ) a Bedouin whose name he does not know but who is a resident of Zubair. While leaving Jibutil, the Nakhoda took out a French Register and flag. On reaching near the Kurria Murria Islands (Ras Noos) they were met by a British man-of-war which searched the vessel and found therein such a number of rifles as was mentioned in the Register ; and (this happened when) the flag was flying on the boom. The man-of-war left the vessel and went her way.

I sm to observe that, though the rules in ques tion are stated to be prejudicially affecting British commerce in other directions, no very serious conse quences would appear to have resulted during the ten years they have been In force. As, moreover, it appears that British traders manage to evade the restrictions to which they are ^ subject Under Secretary of State, India Office.subject, both sir Edward Grey and Lord Elgin are of opinion that it is desirable to keep the regulations in force during the short year which is all that will elapse before the meeting in April 1908 of the Con ference which is to discuss the general question of the Anns traffic in order that His Majesty's Govern ment may not on entering that assemblage, be open to the charge of having relaxed their supervision in any '| territory affected by the question.

Sir, Downing Street, May 3, 1907. I AM directed by the Earl of Elgin to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo, transmitting a copy of correspondence with the India Office respecting the proposal made by the Government of India to cancel certain rules issued in 1898 for the regulation of the traffic in arms at Muscat by British subjects, and to request you to inform Sir Edward Grey that his Lordship concurs in the terms of the reply which it is proposed to return to the India Office.

Geet, I.A., Political Agent at Maskat, To-The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to forward for your information a copy of letter No. 122 1 Enclosure. which I have addressed to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. No. 122, dated Maskat, the 12th March 1907 (Confidential). From— Major W. G. Grey, I.A., Political Agent at Maekat, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. In continuation of my letter No. 45, dated 2lst January last, I have the honour to make a further report in connection with the arms trade. 2 . On the 3rd instant a small dhow left Maskat with a cargo of arms the property of Afghans, and on the 5th, she was followed by two more. This information was communicated by me to the Commander of H.M.S. Proserpine and she searched various dhows and patrolled the coast between Jask and Chahbar without finding any trace of arms. This morning I have heard from the Assistant Superintendent of Telegraphs at Jask that on the 7th instant 1,000 rifles were landed at Jagin, 30 miles east of Jask, from one large dhow belonging to Sbargali or Debai. I have telegraphed this news to the Agent to the Governor-General at Quetta in case it might be of use to him. 3. It is difficult to say whether these arms are those which left Maskatl a week ago or others from elsewhere. If they are the same they must have been transhipped into the large dhow at some Oman post, and enquiry will he made as to this from the crews of the smaller craft when they return here. These took no passes from the Sultan, having been despatched under the auspices of M. Goguyer. 4. There are at present about 100 Afghans in Maskat, more than half of , whom are lodging with M. Goguyer who is providing them with food, etc. I have pointed out to M. Laronce in private conversation that Goguyer must know of the feeling entertained by His Majesty’s Government in regard to the | acquisition of arms and ammunition by Afghans, and have suggested that he j is scarcely acting in the interests of the entente cordiale by encouraging and . assisting them in their purchases. M. Laronce expresses entire agreement | with my views, hut professes to be unable to interfere on account of the | influence of Goguyer’s supporters with his Government. Perhaps His Majesty’s Government might feel able to represent this point to the French, or would prefer that I should address my colleague officially. In the latter case I beg to solicit early instructions. 5. A copy of this letter will be forwarded to the Government of India in the Foreign Department.^7* Foreign Office, London.

With reference to the letter from the India Office to the Foreign Office of No. 3718 -E. B. of ist November I9°4&gt; I have the honour to enquire whether, His Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs has yet signified his acquiescence in the proposal of the Government of India to remove the restrictions to which British traders at Maskat are subjected in connection with the sale of Arms in Maskat. 2 . It is possible that a decision on the point was deferred in the hope that some measure might soon prove possible which would result in the effective settlement of the wider problems presented by the heavy import of arms into But in the meanwhile the retail trade still thrives in foreign hands and in view I venture to recall the question of the restrictive regulations still in force against British subjects at Maskat, and to express the hope that sanction will be accorded to their being allowed to lapse. •Pro.

Third and fourth Persian launches are now about to leave Karachi in care of Lawrence.

I beg to thank vou for your telegrams of the 27th November and 2nd December^ Nos. 497 and 504, and in confirmation of my telegram of the 6 th December to you in reply, to say that I regret that I cannot comply with your request for a British Naval crew to man one of the Persian launches, as such an act would probably involve complications, and I think the status of a British man-of-war’s crew manning a Persian Customs vessel 1 P^} er sanction of the Belgian Director-General of Customs would be ^ffmult to define, and, should trouble arise, be hard to justify; but I thought t at perhaps you would be able to arrange with the Director-General of I ersian Customs for the hired Indian crew to remain at the expense of the Customs. In any case, the Sphinx and gunboats could not provide the necessary crew, as they have so far few Europeans in their complements. 2. I have directed Commander Bowman of the Sphinx, Senior Officer in the Persian Gulf, to place one gunboat at Charbar, and to use bis utmost endeavours to check the Arms Traffic ; and as soon as the Royal Ind Marine Dockyard at Bombay have completed the A ls * December, that cruiser will be sent to reinforce the Persian G immediately she is ready. . 3. The Sphinx and Lapwing will remain in the Gulf until it is tune for them to meet their relief crews at Bombay towards the middle o Eebruary, and I intend to send the Proserpine to the Persian Gulf as soon as she is refitted, which will not, I fear, be until early in Eebruary. 4 I am writing by this mail to Commander Bowman to give him my ideas as to how be can best assist on the Maskat coast, but much must he left to his discretion, in conjunction with such advice and information as you and Major Grey can give him.

Jask or Charhar being for the present out of the question, launches three and four are now to be delivered at Bunder Abbas, and I am using my endeavours to get the Customs Administration to prepare one for sea as soon as possible.

I have the honour to make a report in connection with the export of arms and ammunition to the Mekran Coast. 2. Since I last wrote on this subject two dhows have left either Maskat or Muttrah for Mekran. The first left on the 5th instant with 300 rifles, and although I telegraphed her departure and probable destination to the Commander of His Majesty’s Ship then at Jask, and a search was made by the Lapwing and the Redbreast, she succeeded in landing her arms and returned empty two days ago. On the 13th another left with 400 rifles and the same steps were taken by me. I have not heard of any result, and this vessel has not yet returned. 3 . I make this report to shew the difficulties under which we labour at present in this connection. The Nakhudas of dhows carrying arms to Mekran take passes from His Highness the Sultan for some Batinah port, and proceed for 100 miles or so up the coast before attempting to cross. The person in charge of the arms changes the destination during the voyage in order to nullify the danger resulting from information given before her departure, and it is said that the arms, on arrival at some unfrequented part of the Mekran coast, are buried until a suitable time comes for their removal. 4 .

With reference to correspondence ending with your office endorsement No 3075, dated the 23rd December 1906, on the subject of the Arms Traffic, I have the honour to report that I have now discontinued sending parties on board the steamers arriving from Maskat and Delai, as with the staff and means at my disposal I do not feel that the work can be efficiently performed, while at the same time the attem pt disturbs too much the ordinary work of my office. 2. I am not prepared to say that the importation of arms and ammunition by British India Steam Navigation Company’s steamers is as small as appears from the results of the past seven weeks, for I have come to the conclusion that both the Customs Farmers and the Landing Contractor are equally averse to exposing infringements of the laws in this matter, but even if, as is quite possible, a case or two of rifles have escaped detection each week, I th ; nk it may be concluded that this portion of the traffic is an infinitesimal fraction of the whole. 3. The action taken by the Chief and myself has at any rate had the effect, I am told, of causing Yusuf Fakhra to send word to his Agents in Maskat to refrain from sending contraband by Steamer to Bahrein. I propose to keep the same spirit of uneasiness alive by having the exami nation of passengers* baggage in the Customs House watched occasionally by special representatives of the Chief and myself, but I regret to report that I see no effective way of checking the importation into the tribal villages by sailing boats from Ka-ar and Oman.
