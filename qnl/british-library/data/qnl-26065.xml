Dear Peel, I want to make an effort to retain one of my two remaining lady Assistants; in fact, they are the only Assistants I have left now. Both are proficient and trustworthy.

I was wondering if you could help me in this. I could come 3.T.Peel Ksq., C.B.E., M.C., India Office, Whitehall, S.VJ.l.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000517.0x000339_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/814</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000517.0x000339</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/814</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Ext 2162/43 'Bahrain Petroleum Co:personal assistants of Mr H R Ballantyne'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1943/1943</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-06-08T23:23:57</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (3 folios)</extent><extent>The file's contents are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 3; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file comprises personal correspondence between Mr H R Ballantyne, agent of the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited, and Roland Tennyson Peel, India Office, regarding the matter of Ballantyne's personal assistants.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Ministry of Labour</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Bahrain Petroleum Company</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000517.0x000339#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
