In accordance with your Instructions I hare the honour to report that I loft Bushlro on tour on January 3rd, for asra ton routs for nwalt whsrs l stayed froa January 5th to 9th. Froa Kuwait to Bahrain I was very kindly given a passage by Captain Creagh, Senior laval Officer, Persian Gulf, in ^Shorshaa’* and his kindness and that of his officers did much to aitigats the effects of the weather we encountered. Z. The length of ay fi«it to Bahrain froa January 10th to January 16th and of ay stay at Muscat froa January 21st. to January EBth. was deteraiaed hy the sailInga of the slow xail steamers which connect these ports. Apart wo catch the fast mail steamer fro® Karaohl to Bushire the utility of ay oall at Karachi was considerably restricted owing to the lateness of ®y arrival there and to the aoaenoo of several people to who® you so kindly gave m introduatlona.

Everywhere on the Arab Joaat the bazaars are flooded with Japanese goods which are offered at prices usually ranging from one quarter to one third of the articles which they are supplanting* A certain amount of the trade is done direct with Japan but the bulb: of it is done through agents in Bombay or Karachi* Tts noocss is almost entirely due to prloe although the quality, appearmnoe and packing are said to be the deciding factors in son;* oases* 7* Cotton and artificial silk goods, in ths piece and other wise, are the most prominent Japanese goods in the Gulf and they are undoubtedly supreme* Tennis shoes,crockery and cement are also Important lines but the competition covers a wide range* 8• feffoot on Statec Hevenues* So far as the Arab States are concerned this wavs cf cheap goods is rather a mixed blessing* The joy and satisfaction wnioh it affords the poverty stricken masses,and which it is in the interests of the various Shaikhs to cultivate,is tempered, for the rulers, by ths prospect of its effect on Stats revenues* 9. The tempting prices will certainly result in an expansion fo* 9# the need, for more frequent renewa^of goods of inftrior qua!ity tod partly to tho tnhasood purchasing power of tho local onrronoy f ao that at loatt part of tho oaring in money resulting fro* tho aooulaltloxi of ohoap Jaaneoo goods will bo oxpondod on tho purohaso of other oottmodltleo, but, it le extremely doubtful If the total value of imports from which the States derive their revenues on an ad valorem basis, will be maintained. 10. In tbeeo olrenmetaaeee the Shalhhs of all the Arab Statoe are new faoed with the prospeot of diminishing revenues, a large proportion of wbioh is taken by ad valorem Customs taxes, and they may therefore have to sonsider measures for the preteotlon of their flnanoes. The present system of assessment of the value of Imports on the looal market value will not continue to afford adequate protection as the market values will decrease with the increase in the volume of Japanese or other cheap goods. 11. Probably the most simple expedient which the Shaikhs could adopt would be to fix the value of eaoh commodity, Irros- pective of quality, on the highest priced goods of eaoh category entering the market, for example, supposing the market value of a piece of 40 yards of Manchester cotton goods Is say flvs *er cent duty would amount to whereas the selling price of tne same quality of Japanese goods Is say Instead of collecting duty at b ' on these goods the duty would be fixed at 2/- which in the case of the cheap goods would amount to ZQ%* this would not of oourse increase the sale of Brltioh goods, the priees of whioh would still remain far above those of Japanese products, but it would materially assist the revenue of the Arab Governments concerned, 12. Another possible method, and one whioh might prove more practicable, would be to determine the volume of the average annual consumption over a period of years and fix the duty par unit on eaeh commodity at a rats whioh, given normal consumption, 40/- 2/- i 10 /-16* ifao 4#manCL for motor car* In tue rariou* State* 1* •till •mall and la oonflnad to the town*, fho waaltheir merchants who aspire to oars ara inollnad to farour saloon models hat the olroulatlon of air in the tourer types is undoubtedly better and consequently they are more popular* I understand that Aiaeri- oan manufacturers have declined to adopt the suggestion that the baok window of saloon ears should be made to open so as to create a thorough draught, which in troploal countries would doubtless bs an advantage* I do not know ix constructional difficulties would interfere with tne introduction of this idea but it appears to be worthy of eonsideration* 17* Appointment of Agents* It is to be hoped that the present strict blockade of Kuwait by Ibn Saud will terminate and that a resumption of the trade with northern Arabia will re-establish the importance of the port of Kuwait* in anticipation of this developmsnt however, one point which United kingdom manufacturers should consider is the appointment of suitable agents* At present the inclusion of Kuwait in the territory of agents in Irak Is the cause of dls- satisf&amp;otion to Kuwait merchants who assert that the agents in Irak are more concerned with the protection of their markets in Irak than with the development of trace in Kuwait* i'hey do not see whfy oou^issions and refits of uwait trade should go to outside agents who seldom if ever visit the place and are not in touch with local eonsitionr• As a result of protests certain sub-agencies have been offered but terms are usually so unfa vourable as to ensure rejection* It may be considered that the market is too Insignificant to warrant the appointment of separate agents but, where the merchants consider that they have a grievance, persistence in the present policy will only drive them to other sourees of supply**• 6 - t 18 * fli# ooit of ux-»oap was quo tod to mo ao a typical example, fdle soap le sold la T «aera, waere tae duty i* f at taree and a Oalf annae per cake. In Indla t where the duty le 80 ;’ or sore, and at Singapore, it le said that the price le three annas, hut the agent la Basra Insists on a price of four annas in Kuwait where the duty is only dfjl* the apparent reason for this being to prevent the oomaodlty entering IraJc through Kuwait and being eold at -rices below those demanded of Xrafcl merchants. Other Mrleete affected on account of similar grievances are those for Morris and othar oars, tyres, elgarsttss, marins engines and oil enginee, 19 * /aluo of attractive packing. In Bahrain, as In all tns other States in the Oulf, the Importance of bright colours and attractive packing should not be overlooked. Jacket Inscriptions and descriptive litera- ture should where possible be in Arable, at least on one side of the packet. 80 . Several Incidents In connection with the methods of certain British suppliers, which have created an impression unfavourable to British Interests were brought to my notice la Bahrain. etaile of the trouble which the rolltieal Agent encountered when, for patriotic reasons he ordered a British Motor Car, are already known to the Department of Overseas trade and also, unfortunately, in Bahrain. 81. Messrs, - bunji * a difficulties with Hiaaiae of Manchester over a consignment of ootton goods, about which there has been considerable official correspondence, have not inspired eonfldsnes. 88* In another ease, a man,impressed by the advertisement in a British magazine of a well known London 8llversalth / plaoed ©a order for two watches, fhe firm la London wrote observing that as the climate of Bahrain was not suitable for the watches ordered *b»j had ta**n th. liberty of ..ndln* two otb.rs wbl.h tb.yconsidered would be more suitable* i’he wato&amp;ee, which coat over tt each, were quite satisfactory out, an agent in the fcas&amp;ar noticed them and, after close inspection, said he could supply the same type of watoh, which was not of British manufacture * at t 3*10.0. the difference in price being obwioualy due to the duty payable in the United Kingdom os foreign watches. 23. An order for a rifle was ssnt to a firm of armourers in London who, in epite of thair advertisement, regretted that they could not wpply so they passed the order to an agent in the United Statea of America who went an American rifle and ammunition on which the freight and insurance amounted to more than the coat of the goods. ^ W it is quits realised that these may be Isolated cases but they do incalculable damage to British commercial prestige, and emphasis# the necessity of a nationality marking on advor- tielng matter as well as on the actual goods themsslvos. 26. Currency . Although Indian Rupees are in eiroulatioa in the towns which i visited, and most of the foreign trade la conducted in that medium, the Maria fheresa Dollar is prefsrrod in trad# with the interior. 26. fhe Marla fhoreoa dollar, current in Arabia and «orth kaet Africa, is a silver currency with no Sovernment Ducking which is minted privately in frieste and the value of which varies with the prloe of silver, it is a large coin, probably larger than the five shilling piece previously minted in the United Kingdom, and le used almost oxolusivoly by the Bedouin,especially those in the interior, 27. While I was in Muscat two Indian merchants advanced an interesting suggestion for the introduction of a Muscati currencyTi) • 8 «• to roplflioo the exist lag s aria Thereea 'Dollar. ( 5 TDe prioe of 100 ^arla fhtreea Dollar is now E* 86. flie prioe of 100 tolas of silver is If 84. (Indian duty paid) of which &amp;ipee* 18.18 is said to he Indian duty. fbe actual price of 100 tolas of silver is therefore Jb 36.4 or Husoes f0.8 for 800 tolas. fhe amount of fine silver in 100 laria thereea Dollar is 200 Tolas. the profit to the firm la frleete is accordingly apparently Rupees ID.8, less chargee, per 100 Dollars. 88. It was suggested that a coin of the eaa»e weight, appearance and else and containing the same amount of fine silver might be minted in India which would he less expensive. After allowing for a profit for India and possibly a Royalty for the Sultan It was claimed that the coin would be cheaper than the 2aria Theresa Dollar and its Introduction would benefit the export trade of the State. As most ef the uscat merchants are both exporters and importers and have their capital in rupees It was argued that the proposal would not affect them adversely. They were also confi dent that, as the new coin would be in all respects similar to the Karla ’Theresa Dollar it would be acceptable to the srabe. 89. Whether this proposal le worthy of the Sultan's considera tion, whether it would be acceptable to India or Indeed whether It is at all practicable 1 should prefer to leave to other Judgement. 1 have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servant.

My dear Sir Trenchard, l I hear from -r*Scott, the ueiieral superintend nt of the /.oweit Oil Company, who has just been to Iraq, that there is news there tnat one of the bi^ American Supply Houses of machinery for oil ields will sho&gt;tly establish a d pot somewhere in this area, probably at r'J.i &lt;a r« . such, firms 1 gather keep a very large stock of machinery and tools at their nopots, so that Oil Companies can readily obtain then, instead of sending for then to the various factories of origin. I understand that it is an institution hich only cones when there is a large demand from several fields, such as those developing now in the hi dale :*ast and the Gulf* It occurs to me that you might wish to know of this, if you have not already eard about it. 2 ^ X gather no decision has been made yet, but that one of the big American firms, the hational supply Company, has been ^aking tentative enquiry. Superior eiaployees of the uil Companies think that hasra in spite of irksome uustoms nules and duties, is the most likely site for a depot because of the landin * facilities and that Bahrain, while conveniently situated is r* ther an unlikely choice, owing to difficult lancing arrangements.
