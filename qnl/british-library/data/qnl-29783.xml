Director General of Customa, Sulta/iata of Muscat 6c Cnan M, 1 scet. To Hia Britannic Majesty's Consul &amp; Political Agent Muscat. Sir, 1 have the honour to address you in continuation of ray letter of the 30th October, 1950 on the subject of my seniority in the Pakistan Customs service. Recently I had occasion to visit Karachi and while there saw a seniority list of Appraisers in the Custom House v/hich I was given to understand was the official list. I attach a copy of this and it will be observed that the indivi duals vfhoso names are indicated against serial Numbers 6 to 10 were all confirmed after I was. I was selectod by the Public Service Commission and directly recruited to the Customs Appraisers Service, and confimed with e?ffeet from tha date of ray appointment. I therefore claim that ay seniority in relation to the five individuals mentioned above should be fixed on the basis of the date of my confirmation. If any other criterion is adopted ray confirmation from the date of my appointment loses all significance. 9 In the Calcutta Custom House all persons who were confirmed after me were shown as junior to me and as the individuals in question all had from about 2 to nearly 8 years service as Appraisers before being confirmed, I can not help feeling that they must either have been temporarily employed in .the grade or been unqualified prior to confirmation. In either case, it seems to me, they should he shown' II CUSTOM HOUSE MUSCAT ae junior to n« in accordance 7/ith the principles laid dow in section (i; and (ii) of the Hone T^ept, Govt of India, Memor&amp;Xidum No. 20/5C/4&lt;:-Ests dated the 28th August 1946, T;hich is taken as e ^juide by the Karachi Custom Rouse in the settlement of seniority cases.
