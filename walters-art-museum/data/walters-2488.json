This model appears to be complete, despite the lack of head, arms, and lower legs.  The grid lines on the legs helped to keep the proportions.  The statue is dressed with a shendit-kilt.  Such models may also have served a votive purpose in a temple setting.", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters, 1912", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/12670", "Provenance": "Dikran Kelekian, New York and Paris, [date and mode of acquisition unknown] [said to be from Dendera]; Henry Walters, Baltimore, 1912, by purchase; Walters Art Museum, 1931, by bequest. \r\n", "Dynasty": "Ptolemaic Dynasty", "OnView": 1, "PublicAccessDate": "2008-09-25T17:13:38.94", "Creator": "Egyptian", "PrimaryImage": {"Tiny": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_22.32_3QtrRt_DD_T11.jpg?width=50", "Small": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_22.32_3QtrRt_DD_T11.jpg?width=100", "Medium": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_22.32_3QtrRt_DD_T11.jpg?width=150", "Large": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_22.32_3QtrRt_DD_T11.jpg?width=250", "Raw": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_22.32_3QtrRt_DD_T11.jpg"}, "GeoIDs": "1544558", "ExhibIDs": "", "Images": "PL9_22.32_Fnt_BW.jpg, PS1_22.32_3QtrRt_DD_T11.jpg, PS1_22.32_Back_DD_T11.jpg, PS1_22.32_Fnt_DD_T11.jpg, PS1_22.32_LftSide_DD_T11.jpg, PS1_22.32_QtrLft_DD_T11.jpg, PS1_22.32_RtSide_DD_T11.jpg", "DisplayLocation": "Centre Street: Second Floor: Egyptian Art"}
