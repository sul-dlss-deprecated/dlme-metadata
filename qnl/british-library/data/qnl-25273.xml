Part 1 (IOR/L/10/PS/291/1 contains correspondence, reports and maps relating to surveys of the Turco-Persian frontier between Hawizeh [Hoveyzeh] and the Shatt-al-Arab, undertaken in May 1912 by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Lieutenant-Colonel Percy Zachariah Cox, and again in June and July 1912 by Lieutenant Arnold Talbot Wilson and Lieutenant Henry Aloysius Bruno Digby-Beste.The surveys were carried out in order to fix the precise locations of the village of Hawizeh and the Turco-Persian border at Mohammerah [Khorramshahr]. The reports submitted by Cox and Wilson set out the topography of the region, its canals and rivers, populations, jurisdiction, tribal affiliations and tribal rulers. Digby-Beste’s report (ff 16-18) details the survey measurements taken between 15 June and 2 July 1912, with calculations of longitude and latitude measurements for Hawizeh.Part 2 (IOR/L/PS/10/291/2 contains copies of correspondence, memoranda, maps and other papers, relating to diplomatic negotiations taking place between the Turkish and Persian Governments, marshalled by the British and Russian Governments, over the fixing of the boundary line between Persia and Turkish Mesopotamia at Mohammerah [Khorramshahr], Hawizeh [Hoveyzeh] and Zohab.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Consul, Tabriz</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Sir Arnold Talbot Wilson</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Henry Aloysius Bruno Digby-Beste</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Mohammerah</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Zohāb</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Hawizeh</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Boundaries</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x0000b7#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
