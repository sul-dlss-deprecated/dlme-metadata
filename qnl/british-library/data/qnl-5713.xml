' UTtt r i India Office, 'with ■ f 17t ^ Se P temb er 1879. , iQierence to previous correspond enop- ending with Sir Juliau Pauaoefoto's letter of the- 6th instant I am directed by Viscount Cranbrook toreques' thatyon wiU submit, for the considera- tion ot Her Majesty s Secretary of State forForei-n Attairs, the following observations explanatorvV the view m regard to Persian Gulf affairs, which, alter perusal of the various papers bearing on the subject, his Lordship is disposed to take/ The more important papers, together with a sufficient description of the localities in question, will, Lord Cranbrook believes, be found embodied m the accompanying memorandum 5 ^ which has been prepared in this Office, and of which copies are for warded for convenience of reference. There can, in Lord Cranbrook's opinion, be little doubt that the present disturbed state of the Arab coast and the seas adjacent is, in a great measure, a consequence (1) of the obstacles to direct action on the part of the British authorities in the Gulf, which are interposed by the position assumed on the Arab coast by the Turkish Government since the Nejd expedition of 1871-72; (2) of the un certain nature of that position; and (3) of the practical inability of the Ottoman officials to main tain order even along that part of the coast where Turkish inffuence is strongest. This being so, it appears to Lord Oranbrook to be important to determine, as speedily as possible, with whom shall rest responsibility for order along- the coast, whether with the Government of alone, or with the Porte alone, or with th( Governments conjointly. His Lordship has considered with attention ^ish views of Lord Lytton's Government on this poi &gt; expressed in their Despatch, No. 127, dated t 22nd May last, and also those of Lord Salisbu 0] as set forth in Sir J. Pauncefote's letter of t 23rd August. The Government of India recommend that from Bussorah to Ojair the authority of the Porte should be recognized as established on land, but that at sea the British Government should con tinue to exercise some concurrent protectorate^ pursuing pirates, if necessary, into Turkish waters,, and dealing with them wherever found, whether at sea or on shore, within certain limits, through the Resident in the Gulf; that, south or east of Ojair, Turkish authority should not be recognized except at El Bidaa, on the Guttur peninsula; and that the Porte should be required \a) to stipulate not to interfere, either on the coast or inland, with the 3122. I. 1091. A Confidential.Trucial Chiefs between Odeid and Ras-el-Khymah; (b) to recognize the temtories of the Sheikh of Bahrein as under the protection of Great Britain, and (c) in case of piracies from within its juris diction, to enforce restitution of plundered pro perty and payment of compensation. Her Majesty's Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs observes, with reference to these proposals, that, in the absence of inducements, the Porte is not likely to assent to the suggested limitations of its sovereignty or jurisdiction, or to independent action of another power in territory or waters admitted to be Turkish. Lord Salisbury, therefore, suggests that it would be more practical, and more in accordance with usage, that, having settled for ourselves ^he limits within which Turkish juris diction' may be exercised, and beyond which it would be rejected or opposed, we should, as a general rule, look to the Turkish authorities to exercise a proper police in those limits, only sanctioning the action of British cruisers in Tur kish waters under special circumstances, when the consent of ihe local authorities has been obtained. The principal objection to the course recom mended by the Government of India appears to Lord Cranbrook to be that it involves a previous understanding with the Porte, which His Lordship agrees with Lord Salisbury in thinking scarcely possible of attainment. Apart from the notorious difficulty of negotiation with the Turkish Govern ment upon any subject, the past correspondence in reference to Nejd and Bahrein indicates that upon this particular question that Government is likely to be found specially impracticable, and that it is hopeless to expect that the Porte could be induced to record, in even the most informal diplomatic document, its assent either to limitation its authority in Arabia or to anything like a it maritime protectorate with the British Go- iment along any part of the coast, and, still to an exclusive British protectorate over rein. t must further, from past experience, be regarded rery improbable that any undertaking on the t of the Turkish Government to enforce from . d parties restoration of plundered property and payment of compensation would be operative in practice. On this point, the complete absence of result from the representations made at Constan tinople in 1876 and lS??, in reference to the cases of the British Indian subjects Cheyla and Rama, and the attack on an Aboothabee boat in the' harbour of El Bidaa, are significant. Lord Cranbrook, on the other hand, fears that the course suggested in Sir J. Pauncefote's letter of the 23rd August, while it would probably be little less distasteful to the Porte than that proposed by the Government of India, would fail to attain the object in view.(i the Tm-V?.i r' auth0nt y alld responsibility of f nmrJ»t tv, r I ,1 - lei would b8 recognized as mplete within certain territorial limits to be fixed tt limit?' a W0Uld be Wh0lly disallowe(i %ond The limit of Ottoman jurisdiction along tbe coast, if it is to be defined at all, could scarcely be fixed at any point north of Ojair, which is opposite the southern extremity of the island of Bahrein; but it is precisely between that spot and Kateef tliat, smce the settlement of the Beni Yas at Odeid was broken up in 1878, the operations of the piratical tribes have been carried on with almost complete impunity. Upon this point Lord Cran- brook would invite Lord Salisbury s attention to Colone l Ross s letter of the 8th JVIayj enclosed in Government of India Despatch, No, 91, of the 28th July last, which was communicated to the Foreign Office on the 6th instant. His Lordship apprehends that the effect of formally recognizing any particular part of the Arab coast and the waters adjacent as Turkish, and as, in con sequence, closed against British cruisers, so far as action against piratical craft is concerned, would be the formation of an asylum which would be taken advantage of by marauders in general, whom the local Ottoman authorities would be unable to control without a considerable and permanent in crease to the Turkish naval force in the Gulf, which the Porte has declared itself precluded from making by considerations of expense, and which would be open to many objections on political grounds. The conclusion, therefore, to which Lord Cran- brook is led is that negotiation or discussion with the Porte on the territorial question should be avoided; but that, in order that the obligations contracted by the Government of India towards the Sheikh of Bahrein and the parties to the maritime truce may be efficiently fulfilled, the Resident in the Persian Gulf should be authorized to adopt all necessary measures for the preservation of the peace of the seas, without regard either to Turkish pretensions to sovereignty over the whole Arab coast, or to the recognition of Ottoman supremacy by in dividual Chiefs such as the Sheikh of El Bidaa, or to the presence of Turkish officials at isolated points. It seems to Lord Cranbrook that Her Majesty's Government have a right to regard the fact of particular ports being used as bases for piratical attacks, and certain tribes being engaged in those attacks, as primdfacie evidence that such ports, and such tribes are not under the effective- control of the Ottoman Government, and that they would be justified in issuing instructions to their officers in accordance with this view. _ Lord Cranbrook is further of opinion that, bavin 0 ' regard to the repeated assurances given b} the Turkish Government in 1871-72, at the time of the operations in Nejd, that no interterence wit the littoral tribes was intended, and to the as otten 3122, A 2 m 14-2.4 repeated declaration of the British Government that it would object to any disturbance of the status quo as regards those tribes, Her Majesty's Government might, if it were deemed expedient, legitimately decline to recognize any part of the coast south of Koweit as subject to Turkey, even if Ottoman authority were established there much more firmly than is really the case. Provided, however, that no obstacles be inter posed to any operations which may be necessary to preserve the peace of the seas and to punish marauders, and that no interference is attempted either with Bahrein, or the trucial Chiefs from Odeid to Ras -el-Khymah, or with Muscat, Lord Cranbrook does not consider that exception need be taken to the proceedings of the Turks at any point of the coast north of Odeid. In expressing this opinion, his Lordship does not forget that the Government of India would restrain the Porte from extending its influence beyond Ojair; but, subject to the conditions above stated. Lord Cranbrook does not see any sufficient reason for objecting to the establishment of such relations between the Turkish authorities in El Hassa and the tribes of the Guttur peninsula to the north of Odeid, as may be agreeable to the parties con cerned. It will have been gathered from the foregoing remarks that, in Lord Cranbrook's opinion, it is essential to the restoration and maintenance of order in the Persian Gulf that no merely nominal extension of Turkish authority should be permitted to hamper the action of the officers of the British Government, and that His Lordship would desire a return, as far as possible, to the system followed until within the last few years, under which the Kesident at Bushire, and the British Naval autho rities acting under his orders, dealt directly with the Arab tribes along the entire littoral, captured piratical craft wherever they might be found, and exacted from the local Sheikhs redress for outrages committed by their people. Under instructions which were issued by the Admiralty in the month of May last, the Com manders of Her Majesty's ships in the Gulf are prohibited from hostile action within Turkish terri tory or its waters without the consent or co-opera tion of the Turkish authorities. Lord Cranbrook would suggest that these instructions should be modified, and that Naval Officers should be authorized, when so directed by the Resident in the Gulf, to act in any particular case in such wise as may be necessary for the capture and punishment of marauders, collision with Turkish cruisers or troops being, of course, scrupulously avoided. If, upon further consideration. Lord Salisbury should be prepared to acquiesce in the policy above suggested, it might. Lord Cranbrook thinks, be left to the discretion of Her Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople either to intimate to the Porte at once the determination of Her Majesty's Govern-rfthe British^lf T 0n - Stratlce a S aiust ^ action rpj p 3' sh authorities m some particular case. ihe pielensions, however, which Abdullah Pasha eiSrr: tr 1 of .

I am, in conclusion, directed to state that Lord Cranbrook concurs in the view which Lord Salis bury takes of the proposal for a revision of treaty relations between the British Government and the Sheikh of Bahrein, the Trucial Chiefs, and the Ruler of Muscat, which is contained in the India letter of 22nd May last. It does not seem to Lord Cranbrook that closer connection with those Arab potentates is necessary or expedient in British interests, or that any object, which cannot otherwise be obtained, would be gained by exacting from them tribute or any other formal recognition of British supremacy. The policy of the Indian Government has always been .to abstain from interference in the disputes and conflicts of the Arab tribes on land, and a departure from that policy, to which closer rela tions might very well lead, would almost certainly result in embarrassment. Lord Cranbrook will reply to the Government of India .in the above sense, so soon as he may be favoured with Lord Salisbury's views on the main question which is the subject of this letter.

It is argued that Britain should maintain their commitments to the Trucial chiefs and the rulers of Bahrein [Bahrain] and Muscat, along with their security responsibilities on the Gulf seas, and if the Ottoman Turks do not impinge on these arrangements little communication with the Porte is deemed necessary. The argument is supported by an overview and discussion of the current situation in the region.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of the Ottoman Empire</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Permanent Under-Secretary of State for India</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Persian Gulf</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Bahrain</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Muscat</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Trucial Coast</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Sovereignty</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000788.0x0003db#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
