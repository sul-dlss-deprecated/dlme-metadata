I pointed out that although I realised this v/as an internal catter, His Majesty’s Govermient were greatly interested in development sch mes in the Middle .Mast in general and that I thought as we had gone to a great deal of trouble in obtaining Hr. Hartley’s services for him we were justified in making enquiries. Even so he refused to go into any details and merely said that he ha^. issued instructions to ./oods-Ballard. I spoke later to oou.s-3allard on the subject and he said that he had been authorised by the Sultan to prepare a five year plan ana had been promised a financial allotment to cover the whole of the plan when it had been approved. I understand that the proposal to set up an experimental farm at Sohar is likely to be abandoned and that a site will probably be chosen at a place nearer ^uscat at the southern end of the Batinah coast, possibly in the vicinity of Dirkah. ioods-Ballard proposes to try to obtain the services of an agricultural officer from India or Pakistan and then to arrange to fly with him over the Batinah coast and select a suitable site. 2.

March 3rd, 1951 . H.E. Sir Rupert Hay, K.C.I.E., The Residency,Bahrain. Persian Gulf. Subject: Prospecting and Mineral Development in Oman. My dear Hay, Please excuse a typed letter, but I want a copy. I got back from Sgypt on the 1st and as the Foreign Office had asked Mabel when I should be back I went along there yesterday. I saw Trevor Evans and told him I appeared to be in the Sultan’s (Said bin Taimur's) bad book, but did not know what may have been my ’’sin' and that anyway I was very sorry as I like the Sultan and was prepared (and had tried) to do a lot for Said bin Taimur at any time he desired. I explained the visit I made in October with the Chief Mining Engineer of the Selection Trust Limited (MacPherson) and what a disappointed man he was when we visi ted the Lead Ore place. The Selection Trust are still keen to explore Oman now that the Dhofar area seems unattractive from the point of view of Ores. But what am I to do if Said bin Taimur does not reply to letters ? However, I am writing to him today also to say that the Selection Trust would still be prepared to make an exploration of Oman on the terms previously arranged with me for Dhofar. They would of course not deal with any Shaikh. It appears from my contact with the Foreign Office that a serious misunderstanding has occurred on this subject of my dealing with the Shaikhs. You told me many months ago that you would not agree to any such action and the matter was then dropped by me although I would not have acted without the Sultan’s consent. Anyway the subject was drop ped and never re-opened nor has any communication or corres pondence been sent by me to any one else other than to your self or the Sultan about the Shaikhs. I myself made it clear to the Sultan, after I had your opinion, that I would not address any of the Shaikhs without his approval and yours, and that should I be permitted to do so I would only do so on behalf of the Sultan or under his instructions for the Selection Trust. I am standing by that and I am quite sure that the Selection Trust would no more address any of the Shaikhs than I would on the subject of mineral development. /on Indeed, one occasion when I contacted the Iraq Petro leum Company Limited and learned there had been delays I offered to take the matter up with the Sultan if it would help. I have made this Shaikh question quite clear to Trevor Evans and he I know appreciates that there has been a mis understanding. I do not even know the name of any Shaikh and have neither the time or inclination to waste effort in such foolishness. With every kind regards to you all Yours sincerely, TO* Major P.C.L.

Situation* The Batinah Coast is considered to comprise the stretch of coast which lies between Muscat town and Ras Musandam the promontory that divides the Gulf of 1 Oman from the Persian Gulf* The distance between these places is 270 miles and within this stretch is found a fertile sandy coastal plain on which date palms are planted in an almost continuous stretch* The boundary of this coastal plain on the inland side is at the foot of the Western Hajr mountains which run parallel to the coast at a distance varying from 10 to 20 miles* POPULATION AND SETTLEMENTS * 5 # The Batinah coastal strip is well populated and the cultivators and fishermen for the most part occupy villages set along the sea-shore, but during the date harvest they leave these villages to stay in their plantations* Some forty years ago the population was estimated at 105,000 while the number of date palms was given as 168,000* I had no means of checking any of these figures, but should say that the palms now number upwards of 1 , 500 , 000 * 6 0 In relation to Muscat and * Oman as a wholethe Batinah is an important agricultural and fishery district and gives an appearance of general activity and prosperity* The people seem hard-working and cheerful and a measure of their contentedness is the fact that they have not left the country in large numbers in order to work on the oil-fields where high wages are paid. Most of the agricultural effort is directed to date production and with this crop and with the present methods at their disposal, it appears that cultivators make use of their resources in the best possible manner* CHOP PRODUCTION - GENERAL* 7 # The cultivation of the date-palm is the most important activity with the growing of limes and mangoes following second* These plantation crops are confined to within a few miles of the sea-shore, where the water-table is high. Inland from this belt of permanent cultivation wheat, lucerne, vegetables and spices are grown. In the Northern districts sorghum, elusine, tobacco and small quantities of sugar-cane appear. 8. The surplus production of the area is mainly confined to dates, limes and mangoes* Internal markets of Muscat and * Oman absorb a fair proportion of this produce but production is influenced by outside markets to the extent that a special date variety suitable for the production of a boiled date for sale to India is planted* are dried for the export trade and fruit and Limesvegetable production in the Sohar district is becoming important under the influence of the demand stimulated from the oil-field districts of the Persian Gulfo PHYSICAL CONDITIONS GOVERNING FARMING, 9 # Climate * The climate is pleasant and cool during the winter months, but extremely hot during the summer* It is a climate which greatly favours the date-palm which is the main crop of the area* 10. The rainfall on the plains is scanty and falls during the winter months. In itself it is insufficient for crop production, but is sufficient to support sparse shrubs and grasses and in the areas of good soil and high water table which exists within a few miles of the sea-shore, the precipitat ion is sufficient to raise a good stand of Sumr (Acacia sp.) and Qaf (Prosopis sp.) which in their later growth behave as Phreatophytes making use of the ground-water supply® 11. Run-off . The great valleys of the seaward slopes of Western Hajr all traverse the plain on their way to the coast, but their courses within the limits of the Batinah are mostly ill-defined and in some places the channels are so broken up and dispersed as to render uncertain the point at which they reach the sea. The run-off from rainfall on the Batinah is insignificant and these water courses are fed from the rains of the Hajr mountains. Thisis said to be quite considerable and sufficient for rain-fed agriculture* Terracing and flood diversion works are said effectively to control any large escape of water to the plains. The supplies are driven underground and this is proved by the abundant ground-water supplies which are found on the Batinah Coast* 12. Ground-water * Ground-water supplies proved and in use are two kinds; firstly, those obtained from springs and solution caverns found near the pediment of the mountain ranges and carried by gravity through gallery systems to the land to be watered; secondly, those supplies which are tapped by open wells located in the fertile strip which extends from the sea-shore to a few miles inland• GRAVITY SUPPLIES. 13* These are obtained through the Palaj gallery systems which are similar in form and development to the well-known Persian Qanat systems and the Mayan of the South Arabian Coast. The Falaj is an adit penetrating water bearing strata and solution caverns or springs in order to deliver the supply by gravity to the surface of the ground at a point where the water is required for irrigation* The systems on the Batinah appear to draw their supply from sources found at the pediment of the mountain ranges and in the case of the three most important systems water is carried a distance of ten miles or more underground beforebeing brougirt io 'the surface f 'to irrigate land on the fertile coastal strip. 14* The source of the supply may be found a considerable distance underground. When tapped the excavation of a tunnel to carry out the water is started. The excavation is punctured by shafts from which air is obtained for the workers while an exit is provided for the removal of the spoil. 15 # These gallery systems of the Batinah differ somewhat in their method of construction from those seen in the coastal areas of the Qua’iti State. In the latter area the clearance shafts are generally close together 15 to JO feet apart, while on the Batinah shafts are seen many hundreds of yards apart. It is possible that the original shafts used to remove the spoil from workings have been obliterated by time or have been deliberately levelled off and covered over. 16. On the whole of the Batinah there are said to be the remains of no less than forty-five old gravity systems. The Wali of Sohar Ya’arab bin Qahtan informed me that there are the remains of at least 10 large gallery systems in the Sohar district and in his company I examined the traces of several of these as well as three of the four existing systems in the district - Falaj A1 ^ohi, Fala^ A1 G-abila and Falaj A1 Aswad. The first two are typical of the large type of system, the third is a small system developed from supplies tapped in a wadi bed above the plain.17* The property of these gallery systems appears to be vested in the community t but the right to share the water is determined by the land holding of the individual* On the *Aohi the up keep is maintained by the sale of four days and four nights of the flow during each year* This is said to bring in the sum of 400 dollars* The division of the water on this particular system is into 24 portions of half an hour each during the day and 24 similar portions during the night* During the day a pole set in the sand is used as a sun-dial to measure the period of time alloted to each user* By night a watchman, who observes the movement of the starts, is responsible for the division of the water* As their wages the measurers receive, it is said, one Jerab of dates - about 90 lbs* weight, for every hundred palms. DISCHARGE MBASUREMEjflTS. 18. I measured the Ealaj A1 *Aohi and found that on the 29th of December it had a discharge of 2*7 cu*secs. Rains are said to have been poor in the past year and as a result there may be some slight reduction in flow, but from the size of the masonry channel and the regulators the reduction - if any - is small only. The second largest Ealaj on the Batinah at present in use is the Ealaj A1 Qabail (or Beni Jabir). Observations on this system showed that the discharge was about the same as Falaj A1 *Aohi, although users generally claim that the B e ni Jabir has a larger flow*(fcROUND WATER SUPPLIES DEVELOPED 7R(M OPi^ffELLS* 19* Water is everywhere obtainable from wells along the coastal strip and the supply is generally sweet to within a close distance of the seashore and in places allows crops such as sweet potatoes and bananas to be grown to within a few yards of the beach* 20. The palm grove belt is found in the area where water can be drawn from easy depths* In land of this belt one finds water at greater depths and here crops of wheat and lucerne are grown, but very few wells of over 35 feet are utilised* The water is sweet* Further inland still, but within the belt of Acacia and Prosopis, water supplies for domestic purposes and the use of livestock are found. These wells are narrow and are made to yield a small supply only. 21. At present nothing definite is known of the possible yield of wells in this area. The extraction rate is at present limited to water lifts usually worked with one man and one bull, giving an estimated yield of 400 gallons per hour* A few two bull outfits were seen and one or two petrol driven centrifugal pumps have recently been introduced to wells in Sohar, but their setting and management was inadequate for any definite deductions to be made on the possible yield. From observations on the draw-down I estimate that a yield of 2,000 to 6,000 gallons would be a possible output from these wells.- 9 - SOILS AND FERTILISERS# 22# The soil of the Batinah is light and sandy near to the sea-coast changing to a heavier clayey loam as one proceeds inland* Low lying salty areas occur in patches along the coast, but these areas appear to be effectively cropped with date-palms so long as a sufficiency of fresh water is made avail able. It appears that the soils are naturally fertile, but under cultivation with irrigation water which is raised by lift or by gravity from springs the application of fertilisers is necessary or in the case of cereal crops Ion? periods of fallow are # given to restore fertility. 23* The cultivators of ’Oman are well aware of the need for fertilisers and they do not fail to make use of them. Pen-manure is carefully saved from the cattle and from the livestock, while collection of droppings from the paths and bare soil areas is also carried out. 24♦ The farmers of the Batinah are fortunate in having at hand a fishery from which fish and fish products are obtained for the manuring of the land. This very attention to manuring reveals the shortage of fertiliser which exists and there is no doubt that expansion of agriculture may be limited by the amount of available fertilisers. BIPLEMENTS AND HAND TOOLS. 25«» The plough is one of common Arabian type, carrying an upright stock and short rather broadthe animals were entire male cattle* 30 * Very shallow wells may be equipped with the cantilever lift of the Egyptian Shaduf type; on the Batinah this is known as the Menzifer* A four-gallon kerosene tin is the usual container attached to this sort of lift* THE DATE-PAM. 31* On the Batinah the cultivation of the date-palm as in all * Oman reaches a very high standard* Indeed, some observers have recorded their view that the date cultivators of 1 Oman are among the most skilled in the world. My own observations, limited to other date growing dis tricts in Southem Arabia, support this view, and I was surprised at the efficient plantation practice carried on notwithstanding the drawbacks which occur through the lack of fodder crops from flood irrigation or rain-fed agriculture on which the animals which work on the lift irrigation could be fed* 32* Spacing * Generally speaking, a spacing of 20 feet is given between the palms* 33♦ Planting Material . Offshoots of moderate size are selected and it is a common practice to establish these offshoots in nurseries located close to the well where watering is given once or twice every day for a period of 40 days to root the offshoots, thereafter less water is given; planting out may take place 6 months or one year later*Prices of shoots vary according to variety; Um Silah offshoots at present sell at M*T« #40 per 100; Mebseli M.T. #80 to #100 per 100. IN the few places where the choice Khunezi and Khalas varieties can be secured up to #2 or more per off shoot is demanded. Rooted offshoots from nurseries sell at about double the price asked for shoots newly taken from the mother palm. 34 . Seedlings . These are not generally left to mature, but in * Oman and on the Batinah there are many date varieties which bear the appellation w Qash H which shows that they are of seedling origin. 35© Planting © Large holes are dug out to receive the young palm and in some cases it is a practice to make two holes; one of large size, about 4 foot diameter, with a depth of 3 feet, and then to excavate a smaller hole inside the larger cutting down a distance of another 2 to 3 feet. The object of this is to lower the palm as near as possible to the water-table. 36. Intercultivation . The whole area of the palm grove is ploughed once yearly. Ploughing round the palm stool may be carried out once, twice or thrice yearly. Basins of established palms are large enough for a pair of oxen to walk round in and to draw furrows in the basins. A plough with two bulls is said to be able to plough round two hundred basins in a day^ work. 37. Manuri ng. Up to three donkey loads ofpen-manure - from cattle, donkeys, sheep and camels - are given each year and three appllo tions are made. Manure is filled into a trench made 1 ? foot deep and 1 foot wide, dug on the perimeter of the basin which holds the palm. Fish manure, of shar&amp; heads and fish waste, is used in the palm-grove^ but in comparatively small quantities. According to Dr. C.L. Bertram, the vast quantities of small fish caught on the Batinah are mainly of anchovy species. 38 . Fish Manure is sometimes placed in a bag or mat container which is placed in the upper part of the furrow system which carries the water from the well so that water is made to seep through the rotting fish before it reaches the cropped land. 39 # Priming . Leaf bases and leaves are pruned off closely. Palm leaf fibre is removed at the same operation and the whole stem is cleaned up. The pnmer is said to be able to clean some 15 palms per day. Great use is made of these p^lra leaves in house building and fencing, as well as in the fishery for the making of boats used by the Batinah people which are made of the leaf ribs sown together. Buoyancy is provided by the leaf oases which are packed into the hull and kept in place by the general framework of leaf ribs. 40. Watering . Abundant water is given and most palms on the Batinah appear to be watered every five to seven days. The water is run frombasin to basin and not on to the intervening areas. 41 . The actual amount of water given varies according to the height of the water-table# At easy depths a cultivator with one bull, working an eight-hour day, can keep watered 400 palms, giving a watering at intervals of five days. At greater depths, say 20 feet, only half this number of palms can be kept correctly watered with the same type of lift. A factor of vital importance is the high water-table and in certain places plantations close to the seashore are kept growing without any artificial irrigation once the roots have become well established and penetrated to the water-table. YIELD . 42. The yield per palm on the Batinah probably exceeds forty pounds average per palm. In favour able situations the average is probably over one hundred pounds. 43 . General Plantation Practice . Palms in 1 Oman are cropped until they become old and un profitable when the planter then starts replanting by filling in new lines of young plants. This re tains the orderly appearance of the plantations and is very different to the practice in other date growing areas such as the vifadi Hadhramaut where replacement is obtained by haphazard planting in gaps or by the growing of offshoots from old mother palms. 44. Packing . The Urn Silah variety is packedin oblong palm-leaf baskets made to hold 1 frasila (Maskati) or approximately 90 lbs® of dates* This is the ’Jerab* well known in the markets of South Arabia* Prom the packing of this variety a sub stantial quantity of date syrup is said to be obtained. The Mebseli variety is sold as a boiled date. Boiling is carried out when the dates have reached the green and red stage. After boiling they are dried. For shipment this date is packed into new gunny bags. The export is to India, where a specialised market is supplied with this type of date* 45* V arieties ^ On the Batinah two main varieties are found; Urn Silah ’’the mother of thorns a soft date producing variety which is said to be highly productive and very suitable for the humid coastal climate and for cultivation on salty areas. This date is consumed in large quantities on the Batinah and coastal areas generally. It probably occupies 10% of all the land under palm groves in the Batinah. 46 . Mebseli . This variety produces a date which is suitable for the production of the dried boiled date which is exported in large quantities from Muscat and ‘Oman to India. Very high prices^ in comparison to soft dates, are obtained for this boiled article, and for some years replacement by the interplanting of plantations of UM Silah and other varieties with Mebseli has been practised by the plantation owners. Other date varieties planted along the Batinah coast are mainly of theRatafe producing varieties for local consuption* Choice •Omani varieties, such as Khalas, Khunezi, Nagal, are planted in small quantities. Many of these choice varieties common to the Wadi Simail and the interior of •Oman do not mature their fruit to the fullest extent when grown on the Batinah. 47 # M ale Palms . No particular variety seems to be selected and a ratio of from one male to twenty to thirty females is probably maintained. THE PIACE OP BATES IN THE ECONOMY OP MUSCAT ANU ott :—~ ’ 48 . In the year 1948-49, the quantity and value of dates exported from Muscat and •Oman was stated to be 12,704 tons valued Rs. 74, 99, 900; of this quantity 11,848 tons were dry dates valued at Rs. 69, 15, 400, while fresh dates were 856 tons, valued at Rs. 5, 84, 500. It is believed that Batini dates contributed less than half to the total quantity and value of this export. The Batini crop is marketed at prices well below that obtained for supplies brought from the hot and arid valleys of the interior, where dates of exceptionally fine quality are produced. Dry dales from the interior usually make over double the price of Batini dry dates, while wet dates from the interior usually sell for 20 L /o more than the Batini crop. 49 # in addition to this export, large quan tities of dates are consumed by the population of * The term signifies a variety which is eaten fresh Such varieties are generally poor keepers.Muscat and , Oman f estimated at over 500,000 souls, and by the livestock of the country* FRUIT PRODUCTION* 50* Fruit production is of importance. The Sohar and Sib districts are the main growing areas* 51* Limes * Sour limes of excellent quality are produced and in the Sohar district these are found in large numbers* Dried limes form an important source of export with Persia providing the main market. In recent years, the development of an export of fresh fruit including limes to the oil fields has become of some importance in the Sohar district. 52* People on the Batinah recognise two types of sour limes; one a single cropping and the other a double cropping type of tree, the latter producing one crop in winter and one in summer* Limes are seen at their best in areas with sweet soil* They are planted in deep basins and receive abundant watering. Propagation is by layering. The trees receive little or no pruning but receive adequate dressings of fish and pen-manure* 53 # M angoes * The Batinah is noted for the abundance of mangoes that it produces. The Sohar district is the main producing area, but for the Muscat and Matrah fruit trade Sib is the supplying district* 54* The mangoes of the Batinah are mixed in quality. This is understandable as they areraised ffom seedlings* Grafting or narcotting does not appear to be practised, and, so far as I could judge, there are no varieties known to breed true to seed in the Batinah* The soil and climate appear to greatly fagour this fruit and some magnificient specimens are seen* I was shown one tree which was said to have produced no less than 18,000 mangoes last season* The average sale price for the crop is fourteen dollars per thousand* This tree is growing on the plot watered by the Tawi A1 Bait, and is said to be a Wakf belonging to the principal Mosque of Muscat* 35# In the Sohar district the abundance of the crop and small local market depresses prices and the general run is said to be between M*T .#5 and M*T .#6 per 1,000 fruits* Improvement in prices has followed attempts made to export to the oil-fields by launch and by motor transport. CITRUS FRUITS* 36* On the Batinah a few sour oranges, shaddocks, pomegranates, guavas and poor quality melons are seen. They are of little importance except for domestic use, as the main market is well supplied in the season with an abundance of fruits from mid-altitude and high-altitude dis tricts, wher 4 citrus, grapes, deciduous fruits and almonds are grown. VEGETABLES* 57# Small quantities of vegetables, sweet potatoes, onions, cucumbers, maize for eating green Ladies* fingers, Brinjals and tomatoes are grown in58* S ugar-can e♦ This crop is seen in some gardens, particularly in the Sohar district. A yellow variety is grown. The canes are soft and are used for chewing. TOBACCO. 59. This crop is seen in the northern part of the Sohar district and it is understood that the export is mainly to the northern Sheikdoms such as Sharjah and Dubai. The variety grown is a strong coarse type suited to the 'hookah” water-pipe smoking trade. CEREAL CROPS 60. The main cereal grown on the Batinah is wheat, a crop which is grown with lift irrigation water as a winter crop. The belt of cultivation immediately behind the palm grove is devoted to wheat growing along most of the Batinah Coast. The lift for the wells growing cereals is generally 15 to |0 feet. 61. Land is ploughed with an ordinary plough and the irrigation beds are made up for broad casting the seed. Manuring is not generally practised owing to demands created by the date and fruit plantations. Instead, it is customary to crop an area of land for one season and then allow it to rest for a few seasons before coming back to plant again. Two varieties of wheat are commonly- 20 planted - Sahalnaut and Hararan, the former said to be ja rticularly rust resistant* Yields appear to be moderate, but with water at easy depths cultivators appear to obtain a satisfactory return* On a good crop the cultivator operating with one bull lifting water 24 feet told me that he hoped to obtain a crop of 20 sacks for sale while main taining his working bull on the green barley, lucerne and weeds from the cultivation, 62* Lucerne * This crop is of great importance for the feeding of animals used on the water lifts* It appears to grow well anywhere when well manured and watered* The area behind the palm belt appears the most favourable for its cultivation and com paratively large areas are found under lucerne in this section* ANTMAL husbandry* 63® General * Livestock at present play a vital part in the economy of the country* Camels provide meat, milk and transport; donkeys are used for transport; cattle provide working animals for the plough and water-lift as well as meat, milk and hides* Sheep and goats are the main producers of meat, but also afford valuable milk supplies, while goat hair and skins are important in the local economy and for export* 64* Camels * Good grazing and browse is found for these animals in the Acacia - Prosopis belt which lies inland of the cultivated zone* Again good grazing is found in the scrub countrymm*** - 21 - towards the foothills® Camels are owned by Batini tribesmen and others who employ them largely in the carrying trade. 65. Cattle . Only bulls are employed for animal power on the water lifts and so the provision of sufficient animals from the cattle herds is of great importance. On the Batinah f where a proportion of the animals are bred, herbage suitable for cattle is scarce, except for brief periods following the rains, and so the owners must help out the grazing by feeding acacia leaf, date stones, dates and dried fish - usually Anchovy species, obtained in great quan tities on the Batinah coast. 66 . The working bulls are fed well, receiving a ration of several pounds of date stones, whole dates, lucerne and fish daily. Much of this food is cooked before being fed to the animals. Roughage is provided by sorghum fodder and by hay. The animals are well tended, fed and groomed by the workers who operate the water lifts, and one reason for this is the local sport of bull fight ing - bull against bull - which draws the well workers to regular meetings where they match their champions. The fighting is mainly a head-on match and as soon as an animal is turned or driven back a distance it will usually break from the ring and bolt, hotly pursued by the victor and by the handlem who keep a hingl leg rope on their bulls. Some may consider this sport cruel, but* 22 - the condition of the Batinah bulls as compared with that of the starved and beaten animals often seen on water lifts in other parts of Arabia is very noticeable, and the real affection and pride shown by the cultivators for their fighting bulls is, I think, largely responsible for the better conditions in which the animals are kept. 67. Sheep and Goats # Sheep are of the fat tailed type and carry a light fleece« Three types of goat are seen, a Baluchi, long-eared type, which carries a fair length of hair, an ‘Omani type brown or black in colour, carrying long hair, and a third type, smaller in size, carrying a short hair. This type is found mostly in the North. Prom all Muscat and * Oman a total of 200 tons of goat hair valued at over Rs. 200,000 is said to have been exported in 1948-49* THE RANGE VBr , -3TA.TI0H. 68 . On the whole, the Batinah has a good supply of fodder trees and scrub, chiefly confined to Acacia and Prosopis sp. 69. In general this range vegetation is well preserved, but in the Masnah district I saw signs of organised destruction of vegetation. In this area members of the Yal Saad tribe were engaged in selling the trees of Acacia sp. - on which their camels rely for grazing - to fuel merchants engaged in the trade between Masnah and the oil fields. It is said that one full-grown Acaciatree in this area sells for 10 dollars and that the price of cut wood at Masnah is 2 dollars per Wazinah - 40 to 50 raaunds, Maskati, equal to 360 to 450 pounds* RECOMEIEDATIONS FOR DEVELOPMENT* 70* S urvey and Exploration of Ground Water Supplies , It is likely that valuable sources of water supply can be found and developed for use on the Batinah, The location and the quantity of such supplies will, to a large extent, deter mine future expansion, and for this reason it is advised that the State undertakes a hydrological survey. This survey should be by geophysical methods and by boring and subsequent test pumping where required, 71. This survey and exploration for water will indicate the extent of the ground water supplies and locate the springs and subterranean rivers which might be developed by erravitv feed through gallery systems or by combinations of lift and gravity and will show the possibilities of lift irrigation with mechanical pumps working on bore hole supplies in the fertile coastal strip. 72. All areas need attention, but in the first place it is advised that the work be directed to the Sohar district, where conditions appear to be favourable for development which will provide a quick return.24 COSTS. 73. It is difficult to give accurate figures as to likely costs. For a straightfor ward geophysical survey&gt; £ 6,000 per aunum should suffice, and within a year a useful preliminary survey of the water indications on an area of the size of the Sohar district should be obtain able. For water boring it will probably pay to purchase the whole of the equipment required and to recruit a crew to work it. The possibility of getting bore holes sunk by firms of contractors should not, however, be disregarded. Firms oper ating in the neighbouring Gulf areas may be able to undertake the work at a reasonable cost, while Indian, Pakistani and East African concerns may also offer their services at attractive rates. 74 o If the Stat* purchases equipment and employs its own crew, a rough estimate would be £ 5,000 for equipment and transport and £ 5,000 per annum for operating costs. Repair of Gallery System. 75. While the work of hydrological survey and boring is in process, development can take place with known sources of water; these are (a) the springs developed for gravity feed and (b) the first layer of ground water - the ohreatic layer, now developed in the cultivated zone by water lifts which are operated by human and animal power. 76. It is advised that a party of localexperts should examine the state of all derelict 'Falaj' systems* They should estimate the likely costs in cash, man power and materials for their repair and should determine the areas to be watered from the systems. They should report on problems of ownership of the water rights, and investigate the ability of local communities to carry out repairs using their own resources, or the extent to which they might co-operate with the State in such work* 73* Where ownership and responsibility is fairly well defined and a local development board can be formed, it will probably be found that the allocation of an advance from State funds will secure the development* Security for the advance can be obtained on developed supplies* 74* It is suggested that it will be necessary for the State to undertake most of the work and by so doing reduce the complicated problems which are likely to arise between private individuals developing the supplies* 75. Should the State undertake the develop ment, it will generally be found convenient to recover the expenditure and to obtain some revenue by retaining the right to one quarter of the supply; the revenue can then be obtained by collecting one quarter of the net produce - that is, the produce left after paying customary wages for harvesting in kind, or by leasing for a cash payment the rightto use the one quarter share of the water retained as the property of the State. 76. Deve lo pmen t of Li ft Irrigat ion. The methods at present employed, in which teams of animals and men work the water lifts are wasteful, and while these methods may be well suited to the economy so long as it remains unaffected by ex ternal factors, it should be recognised that great developments are now taking place in the oil fields of the Persian Gulf and that the economy of the whole area is likely to be changed through this development. 77. It is considered that a great improvement could be made by the introduction of Diesel driven certrifugal pumps. The work of introduction might take the forr cf demonstration by the State and then the encouragement of private enterprise to undertake the introduction of machinery for sale to cultivators, or the State might start a pump scheme which would be responsible for the import, demonstration and sale of machinery and the pro vision of supervision and an efficient spare parts and maintenance service* Later, when the knowledge of mechanical pumping machinery has spread, the task of handling imports and sales could be entrusted to approved firms licensed to import suitable standard types of machine for use in the country. 78 . I consider that the best method is for the Muscat Government to purchase a number ofpumDin^ sets, sell what can be sold for Gash, and the balance on deferred payments to cultivators. This has been done by the Hadhramaut States, where 25^ is added to the landed costs for deferred pay ment sales and a period of 5 years is given for repayment. TYPE 0? UNIT. 79* It is advised that the first introduction of machinery should be of 5 h.p. Diesel driven sets comprising a 5 h.p. Fetter engine direct-coupled to a 2 W Sigmund pump imported direct by the Muscat G-overnment. The cost of this unit should be about £100 - £110 sterling delivered C.I.P. Muscat. This set has been found to give satisfactory ser vice in the Hadhramaut where primitive conditions and rough handling are the rule. No purchase should be made unless adequate spares can be supplied with the units. Engine spares are the most important and two injectors and fuel pumps should be obtained with each unit, together with a supply of the spares normally advised by the Fetter Engine Co. and the Sigmund Pump Co. For each 10 units, one extra unit should be purchased as a stand-by and - in case of urgent necessity - for ^annibalisation.” 80. Piping . Galvanised iron piping should be purchased for use with the pumping sets, and it will probably be found that the delivery of this material will take a good deal longer than the delivery of the pumping machinery. Pipingwill be required for a variety of conditions of lift, and, in order to be ready to deal withp demand which may come from farmers who wish to open up areas of good soil with water supplies deeper than those normally drawn on, a good re serve of piping will be of use* It is advised that for each unit one 8 -foot length of 3 ” and one 4 -foot length of 3 ” bore piping, with sockets a 3 ” elbow bend, flanges, a foot valve and strainer, should be purchased for the suction line, while for delivery piping five pieces of 8 -foot long 2 M bore, with sockets, flanges and two elbow bends should be purchased* If this piping can be supplied by the firm which supplies the pumping sets, no mistake should take place in obtaining the correct fittings* 81. Installation * The installation of the pumping machinery in the correct manner is most important, and the services of a fully qualified fitter should be employed to ensure that the work is done correctly* It is advised that the method adopted in the Hadhramaut be followed on the Batinah* In this method a shaft is cut through the earth to lead down from the ground surface to cut the well shaft at a point just above water level* A pump chamber of suitable dimensions is then constructed at this point* The engine and pump are correctly bedded in this chamber and arranged so that a few feet only of suction lift is required when pumping starts* In poor wells it will be found that the head ofwater is depressed when the pump is worked, and a suction of 10-12 feet may be drawn on* If the yield of water is too low to stand pumping with the 2 ' pump, then reduction pieces can be used to lower the output, but a point may be reached when the wells are too low-yielding to be economical for the installation of a pumping plant* 82. On shallow well sites a ramp cut down at an angle of 30 degrees can be used for the operator to reach the pump chamber, which, in this case, will be situated on a ledge at the well side (see sketch plan of installation). 83. D evelopment of Larger Si zed Pumpin g Units♦ It is advised that such development should only follow pumping tests which can be made with a portable petrol-driven centrifugal pump and flexible piping. This unit could be lowered on a platform to water level. A 4 M size pump should be suitable for testing wells for the next stage of development which should embrace the intro duction of 10 h.p. to 16 h.p. units. 84* Should the yield of the first layer of water prove generally insufficient or should it be desired to change to pumping machinery giving a higher output, boring within the wells to tap the second or third layer of water may be found to greatly increase the supply. This method has been adopted successfully in India and North Africa. In certain situations it may pay toinstal a generating plant and equip the wells with electrically driven pumps of a capacity suitable for the yield from the wells. 85. General Administration of the Pump Schem e. A trial with 20 units of 5 h.p. is advised in the first instance. It is advised that a qualified fitter-mechanic with a good knowledge of Diesel engines should be employed. After installing the plant, he should be given the task of training cultivators in the use of the machinery and its correct care and maintenance. He should make regular inspections to see that the machinery is being used correctly and generally assist cultiva tors to become fully accustomed to its use. For convenience of the work of inspection and training, the installation of the first 20 units should be confined to one district, and it is advised that the Sohar district is chosen, so that th$ fitter- mechanic can, at the same time, supervise pumping machinery employed by the State on its demonstration plant• 86 . It is advised that a contribution of Rs. 30 per_month should be made by each pump owner to the cost of training and inspection provided by the State. As the scheme extends, local knowledge should grow and enable the State to move the fitter-mechanic to a new area of development on the Batinah.ROUGH ESTIMATE OF COSTS OF PUMP SCHEME 87. Personal Emoluments.

Irrigation development has to be paid for and only profitable crop production can do this. Development on the Batinah will be concerned with short-lived crops, such as vegetables, cereals, spices, tobacco, and, perhaps, cotton, and the longer lived crops, such as dates, mangoes, limes and other fruits. 89. The assured markets and the skill of the cultivators on the Batinah make date production and dried lime production the safest form of development, but the possibility of under-cropping young plantations with vegetable crops which canfind a ready market in the oil-fields may provide a means of paying for water development and for helping to establish permanent crops such as date palms, limes and other fruits* 90* Little is known about vegetable pro duction on the Batinah, and the demonstration of methods of growing - first of all, on demonstra tion plots and then on the cultivators* land - is advised* In parts of the Aden Protectorate it has been found that rapid progress can be made if one year only is devoted to trial and demonstration, growing as wide a range of vegetable crops as possible, and that, in the second season, demon stration should be extended to farmers* land - say, a few reliable persons in each village - and that these demonstrators should receive advances against the crops grown and be guaranteed a generous price for the produce when marketed* 91* Demonstration Plots * Sohar is the area favoured for the development of vegetable production and it is advised that an area of 20 acres of good land be selected in the belt of fertile soil which lies behind the palm belt • This 20 acre plot should be divided in two sections and each section should have a well equipped with a 5 h.p* Diesel engine and 2” pump* The land on each 10 acre section should be laid out for irrigation in the * Omani fashion, but all the irrigation furrows should be lined with lime mortar or a weak cement mixture to prevent losses through percolation*- 33 - It is expected that each pumping wait will be capable of keeping: 3-5 acres under cultivation at any one time, while the balance of the land allocated to each unit will be under crops past the growing stage or under fallow or rest# 92# To safeguard the crops and the demonstra tion, it is advised that one complete unit as a stand-by should be kept and that adequate spares be retained, as advised in the general recommenda tions regarding the pump scheme. These spares should be kept on hand and ready for use on the demonstration plot. It is advised that the demonstration plot be made to serve several functions. Firstly to demonstrate the correct use and management of pumping machinery; secondly, the demonstration of vegetable growing and packing for market, and thirdly, to show cultivators new crops and methods which might prove of use to the local agriculture. 9 % It is almost certain that tomatoes, carrots, cucumbers, beetroots, onions, lettuce, cabbage, turnips, peas, beans, marrows and squashes will be successful and comparatively easy to grow, while cauliflowers, l&lt;3eks and celery will grow, but will require much more care as to variety and cultivation. 94 , The cultivation of temperate climate vegetable crops will be confined to the period between about the 15th November to the 15th of May, while in the hot weather a few tropical varieties- 34 - of vegetables, such as spinach, Portulacca sp*, Ladies* fingers (okras), squashes, onions and white radishes, may be grown* Luring the hot weather, the mango and date harvest will normally interrupt labour supplies, and it may pay to re duce operations during this period# On the other hand, the production of hot weather crops of sorghum millet, for fodder and grain, may give a useful return. Experience with local conditions, labour and prices, will determine the most suitable procedure# 95# Consideration of Staff Kequirements and Cost# Good staff is difficult to obtain and is expensive. To run the demonstration plot, visit farmers and secure their co-operation and generally manage the whole development of vegetable pro duction, a first-class man should be obtained. It is possible that a suitable man might be obtained from among the skilled cultivators and agricultural officials who have been forced to leave Palestine, or a suitable horticulturist might be obtained from Egypt. I estimate that a suitable man, taken on contract, would require £600-£800 per annum, with free housing and passages and medical attention# In three years* time, he should have demonstrated and organised demonstrations to a sufficient extent to enable cultivators in the district to carry on without his supervision, and he should in the following years be able to devote his time to grading and marketing supervision and be able to start work on other crops, such as mangoes andcitrus, which are capable of great improvement by simple means such as grafting and. budding o^ the best mangoes found on the Batinah and by the introduction of new types for trial and propagation* 96 * The demonstration plots should be made the centre from which the pump scheme is adminis trated, and the fitter-mechanic should, I suggest, be based on this demonstration plot* 97 # The supply of good quality seeds and seedlings from the plot should be made one of its important functions and one which should greatly assist any development of a trade in fresh produce* 98 ♦ Rough Estimates of Coats - dem onstra tion “Farm* Personal iJmoluments* Horticulturist to supervise demonstration farm and to undertake extension work, £700 per annum flat Passages, transport, etc* Pump drivers and attendants to work under fitter- mechanic - 2 at Rs*60 each per month Field labourers, 12, at Rs* 30 per month Ox driver, 1, at Rs* 35 per month Rs. 9^100 Rs. 1,900 Rs* 1,440 Rs. 4,320 Rs* 400Other Charges* (a) Capital Well sinking and equipment for pump installation, two wells Rs. 1,000 3-5 h*p* pumping units, spares and piping Rs. 5,400 INstallation Rs. 300 Purchase of Livestock, one pair of bulls and one donkey Rs. 450 Housing and office accommo dation in mud brick for horticulturist Rs. 3,000 Palm leaf huts for labourers Rs. 500 (B) Recurrent expenditure - Fuels, oils and lubricants (fuel for 12 hrs. pumping per day throughout the year) Rs. 6 , 000 Implements and tools Rs. 300 Seeds and fertilisers Rs. 300 Transport Rs. 1,000 Packing materials, etc• Rs. 1,000 Fodder dates, etc., for ox and donkey Rs. 730 Contingencies Rs. 1,000 10,650 10,330 Total Other Charges Rs*20,980 Total Personal Emoluments Rs*17 f 160 TOTAL ....* Rs*38,140 COTTON GROWING* 99* It is advised that Etyptian type cotton be tried on the Batinah* With present prices of over 40 pence per pound for high grades, cotton should pay well when grown with lift irrigation, provided that a good yield can be obtained. Thevariety suggested is X1730A - a Sakel Egyptian derivative. A supply of this seed can be ob tained, on application, from the Department of Agriculture, Aden Protectorate. In the Aden Protectorate this variety has yielded 2,000 lbs. and over of seed cotton to the acre, equivalent to over 600 lbs. of lint per acre. 100. There is a cotton famine in liidia, and it should be possible to get a good price for the first crops grown by selling seed cotton - that is, unginned cotton - to India. If the pro duction develops, then a local Board, financed with State capital, might be formed to buy seed cotton at fixed prices and to undertake the ginning and marketing of the crop. FERTILISERS. 101. Any expansion of farming, particularly towards the growing of market garden crops, must be associated with an expansion in the production of fertilisers or the acquisition of increased supplies from some source. On the Batinah there is little chance of finding any increase except perhaps by the collection of sea-weed, but in nearby countries there are probably several likely sources. 102. Guano . A survey of the guano producing areas within the Muscat and 'Oman territories and investigation of the possibility of purchase from nearby States is advised.103* F ish Manur eo Quantities of fish manure are produced in Dhufarf but expansion a^riculti re there will probably demand all available supplies* Distance is also against the utilisation of such supplies, but it is understood that in His Highness* territory of Gwadar on the Haiuchistan Coast there may be developed a fair supply of fish manure largely from fish scrap and waste, while in neighbouring territories the same type of material may be found to be obtainable* It must be stressed that local fertilisers are already in short supply and so outside sources must be drawn on* For this reason, the development of the fishery by improved methods and the production of more fish manure (a proportion of which might be reserved for the use of the Batinah) is of great importance to agri cultural development* 104* Artificials * The present price of artificial manure appears to be prohibitive, but for the intensive production needed to supply a good and profitable market, the use of even high priced artificial fertilisers may be justified* The determination of the value of artificial manures, as compared with local organic manures, will require experimental work of an advanced technical nature, but assistance might be sought from experimental stations in other countries, which would no doubt be willing to advise on the laying down of the experiments and finally to analyse statistically the results obtained from the trials*Protection of the Range Vege ta tion 105. It is suggested that early legislation be en acted to prevent the destruction of any vegetation and it is suggested that the only satisfactory way will be absolutely to prohibit the export of firewood by sea or by land from any district on the Batinah. MARKETING AND TRANSPORT. 106. One of the obvious lines of profitable development already recognised on the Batinah is the production of fruits and vegetables for the oil-fields trade. The successful development of this trade will largely depend on efficient marketing and transport. Already the Batinah has abundant and cheap fruit supplies - mangoes, limes and fresh dates - during the summer season and has nearby such fruits as grapes, pomegranates, citrus and deciduous fruit which come into season during the summer and are brought from the high mountair country for sale on the Batinah. The question is how to secure a satisfactory grading and marketing system and to afford swift transport to the oil fields market. 107. One way for the Muscat Government would be to offer graded produce of different kinds at fixed prices delivered to specified marketing centres, but this would hardly be sufficient, for, although such marketing centres might supply the trade which leaves the Batinah by launch and motor lorry, produce sent in this fashion could not beexpected to compete in freshness with supplies delivered by air from places even as far away as the Lebanon to the oil-fields, ^or this reason, I advise that a full-sized landing ground be constructed on one of the many suitable sites to be found on the Batinah and that encouragement be given to the oil-fields companies to purchase produce delivered to the landing ground and to fly the produce to the areas where they require it. Should this latter arrangement fail, it will be necessary for the Muscat Government to charter freight planes to undertake the transport, and it should be possible to secure contracts in the oil-fields which will pay for air freight and leave a fair margin to pay for the produce delivered by the farmer. 108. In the Aden Protectorate it has been found possible to make an arrangement ot this sort. Growers on the Audhali Plateau receive a fixed price of Rs.l/12 per farasila of 28 lbs. for vegetable produce delivered to the landing ground. This produce is purchased by a contractor, who sends it down to Aden by air freight, and in Aden the bulk of the produce is sold to the services supply depot by the contractor at fixed prices, while the balance is put on the open market. 109. In this vegetable marketing it should be assumed that the producer will receive about 30/o of the final price paid by the consumer, and this 30# should be subject to State taxes, such as theZakat, collected at 5^ on crops raised by lift irrigation* 110. Return freight on aircraft coming into the Batinah might be provided by the fuel supplies, Diesel oil, required for the pumping plants - as these develop - or by passengers* CEREALS AM) OTHER FIELD CROPS * 111* With lift irrigation and the orovision of sufficient fertilisers, the production of cereals such as wheat, barley, maize and millets, and pulse crops, root crops and oil seeds, might be greatly expanded. Experience with mechanical methods will determine the profitability of such cropping*</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000881.0x00003a_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/6/283</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x00003a</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/6/283</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 8/90 III ECONOMIC AGRICULTURAL &amp; INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT IN MUSCAT TERRITORY.'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1950/1951</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2018-04-20T22:10:25</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (66 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in chronological order from the rear to the front of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 68; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.

The bulk of the file consists of a copy of a report produced by Brian Joseph Hartley, Director of Agriculture, Aden, which is entitled 'A Preliminary Report on the Agricultural Resources of the Batinah Coast – Sultanate of Muscat and Oman' (ff 27-67). A similar report relating to the province of Dhofar was produced by Hartley two years previously (see IOR/R/15/6/282).Two letters exchanged between the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and the Foreign Office discuss the steps that the Sultan of Muscat and Oman [Sa‘īd bin Taymūr Āl Bū Sa‘īd] intends to take to implement the recommendations made by Hartley in his report. It is noted that the recruitment of an agricultural officer and a fisheries officer from India or Pakistan is being considered, with the Foreign Office suggesting that the Sultan should consider recruiting Palestinians for these posts, with a view to later allowing Palestinian refugees to settle as cultivators in Muscat.Also covered very briefly in the file is the recent visit of consulting geologist Sir Cyril Sankey Fox to Dhofar to examine lead ore deposits, and Fox's wish to carry out similar prospecting in Oman.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="personal"><namePart>Cyril Sankey Fox</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Director of Agriculture</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Batinah Coast</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Agricultural development</topic></subject><subject><topic>Minerals</topic></subject><subject><topic>Resources exploration</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x00003a#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
