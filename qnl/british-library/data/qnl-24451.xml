No TSA.2/4768 dated the 6 th March 1947. We understand from our London principals that they have been in correspondence with the India Office on the question of boundaries between the various Sheikhdoms on the Trucial Coast. Our principals took the view that boundaries should be settled prior to drilling or other intense activity which could reveal to the Shaikhs the position of potential oil fields. It is understood that the India Office prefer not to undertake a general boundary demarkation but would prefer to limit rulings to cases of possible dispute. 2* ^ We consider a case in point has now arisen between Abu-Dhabi and Dubai. Geo-physical work this season 1946-47 indicates two po^en^ lal oil fields, both partially in disputed territory, and it ishighly desirable to establish ownership before intensive work next season reveals the Company^ interest in the disputed area and gives the Shaikhs ideas on its value to them. Actually for the next two seasons geo-physical and seismic work will, in all probablity, be oriOiient rated on^ thf Afru-j MMM yidf. which may be expected to intensify aM^eBenr Gubai claimsT 3* Our geologists have put forward an idea that in certain circumstances,where at all feasible and wnere a disputed area lends itself to it, the boundary line could with advantage oe drawn on a geological basis, thus avoiding the splitting of an oil field involving the Company in all the evils attendant upon such a situation. Such evils could easily include prolonged litigation in connection with oil royaltiea, or hostilities between Sheikhdoms or tribes. The geologists further state that these circumstances apply in the Dubai Abu-Dhabi area, and that the red line on the attached map, by a useful coincidence, both separates two potential&amp;) n Cont. TSA.2/4885 oil fields in the area Jabal Ali south-westward to Khor Ghanadah, and divides approximately centrally a disputed territory, (provided the Company’s information on the disputed territory is correct). A line drawn elsewhere it is believed would split a structure or potential oil field. 4. We have been instructed by London to approach you locally with a view to obtaining a ruling on the boundary between Abu-Dhabi and Dubai in the disputed area, and if appropriate we shall be pleased to hear if consideration can be given to the Company’s suggestion that the geological factor in this case should be taken into account. As explained above time is short, as next season’s geo-physical work will commence in September/October. 5. In conclusion we would make it clear that our use of the term ’potential oil field! should not be taken to mean that oil has been located, but that possible structures exist. Yours faithfully.

The 13th December, 1947 Dear Jackson It is unfortunate that, as appears prom your demi-official letter No. 1167.0215, xJated the 1st of December, 1947, you took no papers, and nothing but verbal instructions with you to Sharjah about the Dubai-Abu Dhabi boundary ques tion: because it. is, as you are aware, the reason why such insistence has been placed for months past upon your speedy posting to the Prucial Coast. I now enclose a copy of letter No. rSA.2/43S5, dated the 30th April, 1947, from Petroleum Develop ment (Trucial Coast), Limited, and its enclosure in original, and also of Residency Express Letter No. 1400-3, dated the 29th July, 1947, which seen to me to be adequate for you to proceed with the case, as well as being the most useful papers on my file.

In view of ©ur forthcoming assumption of responsibility @f the Persian Gulf we have been leaking at the question ©f the possible settlement of frontier disputes between the various Trucial Shaikhdoms and the problem of enfercing any decision which may be reached. In this/connexi©u we have seen yeur letter to Donaldson Nc.D.0.104C-S of the. 30th May, 1947 and Galloway’s express letter te the India Office Ne. 14,00-S of the 29th July, 1947. \r ,g. With the growing interest in oil. development on the Trucial Ooast it certainly seems desirable, if it is at all possible, to settle the frontiers between the Trucial Shaikhs and the frontiers between certain of them and Muscat; and any definition of the lateral boundaries of the Trucial Shaikhdoms would also assist us should it at some time be necessary t© divide up the Continental Shelf of the Persian Gulf. The difficulties of course, are great and there is the added complication that we do not want to stir up the question of frontiers between the T Trucial Shaikhs and Saudi Arabia if it can be avoided. We should much appreciate it if you could let us have your appreciation of the whole problem, including the question of enforcement. My preliminary feeling about the latter question is that however desirable it might be t® have some kind ©f lecal fo.rce as in Aden, this would presumably cost money and that in our present financial circumstances it would probably be very difficult indeed t© obtain sanction for the expenditure.

The limit of Muscat's jurisdiction in the Wadi el Qaur was described in the enclosure to my printed letter No.C/163 dated the 5th February, 1948, and the boundary between Muscat and Kalba is established at Khatam Malahah.and is marked by a stone wall. I enclose copies of two original documents now in the possession of the present Shaikh of Sharjah, with translations. You will observe that in 1268 Hijri (99 years ago) Sai'd bin Sultan of Muscat renounced all intention fce interfere with the tribes subject to Jawassim influence in the area from Khatam Malahah westwards and northwards to the Dhahirah. In 1288 Hijri Turki bin Sai'd reiterated his father's undertakings to the Jawassim, but made an exception of Khassab. The Muscat claim to suzerainty over the Beni Ka'ab and the Nai'm of Buraimi (including the Al Bu Shamis) appears to be of more recent origin, because the present Shaikh of Sharjah claims that in 1268 Hijri the Jawassim were paramount over all the tribes of Buraimi. Had Muscat at that time any suzerainty ovei these tribes presumably it would have been mentioned in these documents,as Khassab was. oral discussion only and I am letting you have myfin 190S A.D. Lorimer (pages 963 &amp; 1302, Volume II) found the Heni Ka’ab distributed between the Oman Sultanate and Trucial Oman, and the Nai'm in both these areas as well as in Independant Oman; but he does not say under whose suzerainty they were at that time, if Muscat have since rejected the documents in the possession of the Shaikh of Sharjah and no longer recognize the boundary at Khatam Mafeabah, now would appear to be the time to start settling the boundary again. I have . already suggested that we should obtain' 3011 ^ statements of the boundaries claimed for Ras al Khaimah and Kalba from the prospective Shaikh and Regent, and I think we should recognize only those that are undisputed and leave the rest without prejudice for settle ment by negotiation with Muscat. tfaAMAdd&amp;fa 4 * The Shihuh recognize Muscat's suzerainty but the Shaikhs of Bakha and Fujairah do not. 5 * 0ur arbitration in the dispute between Abu Dhabi and Dubai and Sharjah's l°^Phaid are not likely to stir up the question of frontiers between the Trucial Shaikhs and Saudi Arabia. 6 * There are no other active disputes over boundaries between the Trucial Shaikhs. \ On the subject of enforcement I would not go so far as to say that the establishment of a local force will never be necessary, for, if Petroleum Development ( Trucial Coast ) Limited's activities lead to our having to take a more active interest in the3 rv S (°’ts V 2 /v Dhahirah area, something of the sort might eventually be necessary for use in Dhank, where at present there is no security and no single authority capable of establishing it. But I do not regard such a force as necessary for the enforcement of any settlement that we may reach in the Abu Dhabi and Dubai dispute, or in the dispute about sovereignty over Dhaid. The Shaikhs of the Trucial States are very susceptible to the sea power that we have had for years and, in addition, we now have the R.A.F. to call upon, although we have never had to do so in the past. I do not foresee our having to do so in the near future. The sanctions that we can use against the Trucial Shaikhs were mentioned in the enclosure to my demi-official letter No.C/7 dated the 3rd January, 1948. In boundary disputes that affect the development of oil resources, however, by far the most powerful incentive to settlement is the oesire of all the Trucial Shaikhs to have their oil resources developed, and the knowledge that no company will develop oil in a disputed area should, I think, eventually lead them to agree to our artitrstion and to •their abiding by our awards. This will, perhaps, take time; but I believe that settlement by consent is feasible and indeed the only satisfactory way of reaching a settlement.In the Name of God, the Compassionate and the Merciful. r ^ 1 p^.

As far as I am aware there is no active dispute » about the boundaries between Muscat and Has al Khaimah or Muscat and Kalba. The limit of Muscat's jurisdiction in the Wadi el Qaur was described in the enclosure to my printed letter No.C/163, dated the 5th February, 1948, and the boundary between Muscat and Kalba is established at Khatam Malahah and is marked by a stone wall. I en close copies of two original documents now in the pos session of the present Shaikh of Sharjah, with translations. You will observe that in 1268 Hijri (99 years ago) Sai'd bin Sultan of Muscat renounced all intention of interfering with the tribes subject to Jawassim influence in the area from Khatam Malahah westwards and northwards to the Dhahirah In 1268 Kijri Turk! bin Sai'd reiterated his father's under takings to the Jawassim, but made an exception of Khassab. The Muscat claim to suzerainty over the Beni Ka'ab and the Nai'm of Burami (including the Al Bu Shamis) appears to be of more recent origin, because the present Shaikh of Sharjah claims that in 1268 Hijri the Jawassim were paramount over all the tribes of Buraimi. Had Muscat at that time any suzerainty over these tribes presumably it would have been mentioned in these documents, as Khassab was. In 1908 A.D.

If Muscat have since rejected the documents in the possession of the Shaikh of Sharjah and no longer recognize the boundary at Khatam Malahah, now would appear to be the time to start settling the boundary again. Jackson suggested that we should obtain statements of the boundaries claimed for Has al Khaimah and Kalba from the prospective Shaikh and Regent, and I think we should recognize only those that are undisputed and leave the rest without prejudice for settlement by negotiation with Muscat. 3. The Shihuh recognize Muscat's suzerainty but the Shaikhs of Bakha and Fujairah do not. 4 The Hon'ble Sir Rupert Hay, KCIE, CSI, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, B_A_H_R_A_I_N.4. The Shaikh of Sharjah has made his claim to Dhaid, to which I think he is legally entitled, against Khalid bin Ahmed; it is pending a settlement of the latter*s future. But neither this case nor our arbi tration in the dispute between Abu Dhabi and Dubai is likely to raise the question of frontiers between the Trucial Shaikhs and Saudi Arabia. 5. There are no other active disputes over boundaries between the Trucial Shaikhs. 6. On the subject of enforcement I would not go so far as to say that the establishment of &amp; local force will never be necessary, for, if Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Limited's activities lead to our having to take a more active interest in the Dhahirah area, some thing of the sort might eventually be necessary for use in Dhank, where at present there is no security and no single authority capable of establishing it. But I do not regard such a force as necessary for the enforcement of any settle ment that we may reach in the Abu Dhabi and Dubai dispute, nor in the dispute about sovereignty over Dhaid. The Shaikhs of the Trucial States are very susceptible to the sea power that we have had for years and, in addition, we now have the Royal Air Force to call upon, although we have never had to do so in the past:. I do not foresee our having to do so in the near future. The sanctions that we can use against the Trucial Shaikhs were mentioned^ 1 in the enclosure to my demi-official letter No.C/7, dated the 3rd January, 1948. In boundary disputes which affect the development of oil resources, however, by far the most powerful incentive to settlement is the desire of all the Trucial Shaikhs to have their oil resources developed, and the knowledge that no company will develop oil in a dis puted area will, I hope, eventually lead them to agree to our arbitration and to their abiding by our awards. Yours sincerely,jri, UV2c m C OMFiagai I it L Pb!- , UUIF P&amp;SlflfcKCi U«t«a th« 20th April, 1948 Sir, I have the honour to submit the following appreciation of the position regarding the boundaries of the various Truclal Coast sheikhdoms and of the Beans available to us for enforcing any orders we o;ay pass In respect of them* 2. I would invite attention to the map showing the epprox* imate position of these boundaries and the explanatory notes accompanying it which Colonel Calloway forwarded under his demi- official letter No*977-S dated the 12th November 1946 to the India Office* As will be seen from these the situation is extremely complicated* Not only are the boundaries between some of the Sheikhdoms in dispute but triero are areas which owe allegiance to no shaikh recognised by us or which change their allegiance from time to time and there are tribes which though nominally owing allegiance to one of the Truclal Coast Shaikhs or the Sultan of Muscat are to all Intents and purposes independent* Fortunately the boundaries of Muscat, at any rate upon the coast 9 are not disputed and except at the western limit of Abu Dhabi territory the furthest line claimed by Ibn Saud is separated by a broad stretch of desert from the territory under the affective control of tne Truclal Coast Shaikhs and the area in which Messrs* Petroleum Concessions Limited are at present carrying out exploratory operations* 3* The only boundary which it is xwicessary to delimit urgently is that between Abu Dhabi and Dubai* Unfortunately there has been very bad feeling and at times actual hostilities between these two states for the last two years and It was found necessary to bring pressure to bear upon the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi by withholding his quotas of wheat and sugar to compel him to put e stop to the activities of certain tribesmen from the interior who were raiding Dubai at his instigation* It is proposed if possible to persuade the two Fulers concerned to give authority to tne Political Officer Trucial Coast to act as arbitrator for determining the boundary between them* The Shaikh of Abu Dhabi has been reluctant to grant such authority while it was obvious from the continuance of the punitive action described above that Government was displeased with him* It is hoped that a final settlewt of the troubles between Abu Dhabi and Dubai will be reached at an early date and that the ftuxer of the former place will be restored to the full favour of Government but as the Political Officer Truclal Coast is shortly proceeding on leave and will not be replaced during the hot weather it say not be possible to proceed with the settlement of the bound ary dispute before his return in the autumn* 4* Once this boundary is settled It will be necessary to pro ceed with the fixation of some of the other boundaries especially that between Dubai and bharjah* In the mountains to the east and on the eastern coast of the k'usandas peninsula the situation Is so complicated that It may be advisable to leave matters as they are except so far as Fujairah is concerned* until the Oil Companyfetates that it is definitely Interested In this area* X understand it is ? The Ft* Hon« brnest revin, P*C* t M*P, t etc* etc* etc*, The Foreign Office. /not*** z~ 4&amp; • ZS) fn, act regarded by thea at promising. Fujairah is the headquarters / of a bhaikh who possesses influence and force of character and holds a considerable area under his svey as will be seen from Colonel Calloway’s map. Ha has for soma coraiderable time been seeking recognition by His Majesty's Government but the matter has never been taken up by my predecessors mostly I think on account of a reluctance to add to the number of petty Trucial Coast Sheikhdoms. Mr. hermltte Manager of Messrs Petroleum Concessions Limited's office at Bahrain has informed ne that he Is anxious to obtain a concession for the territory of this Sheikhdom and 1 have advised him to address tn« Political Agent officially on the subject* feften he has done this 1 will consider the question of granting recognition to the Shaikh and if necessary address you further on this subject. In the extreme west the Gil Company have already been asked not to operate beyond the line claimed by Ibn baud, ihe xost difficult area is that to the east and south-east of the Buralml oasis. The Gil Company have already carried out some exploration here in direct negotiation with the tribes Kost of wnom are nominally subject to the bultan of Muscat but do not recognise his authority. Thera is a medley of tribes here with Shaikhs whose paramountcy may or may not be acknowledged by the tribesmen and with indefinite boundaries. None of the Shaikhs have any agreement with His Majesty’s Government though.some of them call on the Political Officer or Residency Agent from time to time* For the present all we can do is to leave the Company to aake their own arrangements with the tribes for the time being. Should they eventually decide tc start drilling anywhere in this area we shall have to endeavour to reach seme kind of settlement with the tribe or tribes concerned in consultation with the Puler who claims sovereignty over thesu 5* The first essential is to build a house and offices for a British Political Officer and his staff as without tnls a British officer should not be asked tc remain on the Trucial Coast through out the hot weather* a site has already been selected provision ally and His Majesty's Government's approval and the allotment of funds are awaited* The Political Officer Trucial Coast is at present subordinate to the Political Agent Bahrain but I am of opinion tnat in order to deal satisfactorily with the numerous recognised Pulers and unrecognised shaikhs 9 tc settle boundary and other disputes between them and to cope with the expanding activ ities of Messrs* Petroleum Concessions Limited and the local developments that are likely to result from them the creation of separate Political Agency Is necessary* lip to 1934 when our sole interest was to keep the peace at sea and we concerned ourselves little with internal affairs the Trucial Coast was dealt with direct by the Political Resident through an Arab Residency Agent who lived at Sharjah. After that owing to the development of air eommunlcations ana tne grant of oil concessions by the rulers it was found that the Political Fesident with his headquarters at Bushlre was tot remote to handle the numerous questions which began to arise himself and the bhalkhdons were placed under the control of the Political Agent Bahrain* dince 1940 a British Political Officer has usually resided st Sharjah during the cold weather in subordination to the Political Agent. The latter officer already has his hands full with the greatly increased work resulting from modern developments in Ba rain and with the numerous problems arising from 4 oil development in Qatar and has no longer time to devote to Trucial Coast affairs the attention which they d*servo. i 3,1 \ ll 1 l ‘ I if 6* kith the necessity that has arisen for us to assume respon sibility for the maintenance of law and order not only by sea but also in the interior of tho T^ucial Coast Sheikhdoms 1 was origin ally of opinion that it would be necessary to recruit a force similar to the Aden Protectorate levies* On further consideration have come to the conclusion that for the present at any rate then no necessity to establish such a force. Quite apart from the fact that it would be almost impossible to obtain satisfactory recruits locally 9 as the B*A*K* found when they formed local Levy Corps during the war 9 1 am of opinion that we could deal with any situation likely to arise through His Majesty's Navy or loyal AirForce. The Truclal Coast Shaikhs all have their capitals on tha coast aiid can ba brought to book eithar by a blockade or by ©ora direct action. It is interesting to note that as recently as 1&amp;3&amp; one of His Majesty's Sloops proceeded to Abu Dhabi having the Political Agent on board with authority to boabard the Shaikh's fort should he fall to satisfy the Political Agent that he had put a stop to slave-trading in his territory. Action by air »ight be necessary to deal with an attempt by the tribes of the interior to interfere with the Oil Company's operations. Such action might take the form of demonstratloxis or the actual bombing of hostile concentrations or the P.A.F. might be employed for the transport of troops from Aden, fcgypt or elsewhere to protect the Oil Company's personnel and property in an emergency. I discussed this question with the Air Officer Commanding In Chief Middle &amp;ast during his recent visit to Bahrain and he was of opinion that it should be possible for the ft.A.r. to render assistance of trie kind described if called upon to do so. 1 would however suggest the desirability of working out some scheme which could put Into operation at short notice should necessity arise. If the Foyal Eavy and the B.A.F. are always ready to take action of the kind described it should not 6e necess&amp;ry to consiaer the question of stationing a permanent force in the area until the Oil Company starts intensive operations In the vicinity of the Buraiml oasis or beyond it. 7. To sum up there arc three matters which call for early action vis* (i) the definition of the boundary between Abu Dhabi and Dubai} (ii) (lii) the provision of residences and offices for a British Political Officer on the Trucial Coast and his staff; and the preparation of a scheme for assistance by the hoyal Air Force in maintaining order on the Truclal Coast should this be required. I will dc my best to bring about an early settlement of the Abu Dh&amp;bi - Dubai boundary and should be grateful if His Majesty's Government would accord approval to the second proposal and Issue instructions for the implementation of the third one as soon as possible. 8.

Dubai AUu Dh Boundaty !• Historical. ^Although, ■technically the onus of* proof of possesion of territory is upon Uuhai as that state broke a ay from Abu Dhabi, the historical position of the Dubai Shaikhdom is far om clear, ^ven in 18?0, Dubai was regarded as an independ -ent state for the purposes of the General treaty, which it signed separately, if one accepts the onus of proof as bfe&amp;ng entirely on Dubai, it is doubtful whether that Shaikhdom could really put forward a claim to any territory at all. 2. De facto possession Lorimer gives the Jebel Ali as bei g in Dubai territ -ory. and the general sort of impression seems to be that *. the wells just south of this feature are the area through xk which any frontier sho Id run. Abu Dhabi would claim up 'to and as far as the Jebel AliSs south weste n slope , although this claim could no doubt be reduced. 3. On a previous occasion, during the Khor GhanhaHhah disput both parties agreed'to Ras Hasian as the dividing mark on the Coa st, but whereas Dubai wanted the line to run inland in direction, Abu Dhabi claimed that it should run due East from there. 4. Geographical Considerations. Except for Ras Hasian, there appearsx to be no definite feature which could form a dividing line. It is fortunate, however, that the Oil Company suspect that two distinct geological structures divide at about Ras Hasian. This might mean that the oil on either side of a line drawn at right angles to the coast through Ras Hasian might fall neatly into the two respective Shaikhdoms. 5. Possible solutions. jga&amp;x (a) By considerin the ownership of wells south of the Jebel Ali. This might lead to endless disputes, but is * obviously the most direct method. (b) By an arbitrary line through Ras Hasian at right angles to the coast, which might prove the most satisfactory soluti -on if all other means fail. (c) By ® nsuiting the opinion of third parties. This would gJOdcddy probably not give an impartial ruling. /v.mm. Telegram GTC From Political Agent, Bahrain, Political Officer, Trucial Coast, Sharjah To 91. Dated 13th December, 1948.

As you have already got statement from Abu Dhabi your communication to him may be modified as you think fit. it will be necessary to define the boundary, but suggest in the first place you concentrate on trying to fix a line 40 miles long (not repeat not 40 miles from the coast) commencing from a point on the coast. be followed is that boundary should be the least unac ceptable to both Shaikhs and most likely to recommend it self to what goes for public opinion in area. In light of this, criteria noted in your minute of 2nd December are obviously important but others may suggest themselves as you proceed with investigation. Geological factor is of least importance. 4. After your investigation, shall expect a report from you as to what boundary should be. I am doing what I can about maps and transport. 2 .

Bada al Mughanni, however, to be much used by Dubai. From there I went to Al Eshush (Bearing 310 8 miles) and spent the night at Shaikh Said bin Maktum's hunting camp. He claims well was built by Ma*adhad bin Saif. On the morning of the 29th January, I left Al Eshush for Sharjah via Hafir, Ghafur, Leian, Ram ar Ram, Kameran and Jebel Ali. Whereas the previous day's journey appeared to be mostly in country occupied and used by neither Dubai nor Abu Dhabi, the above mentioned places seem to represent the true western extremity of Dubai territory. Dubai, however, claims all these points as lying insiae their territory. The route was as follows 1 (1) From Al Eshush, bearing 280, distance 10 miles to HAFIR well with 2 trees.(2) Bearing 340 from (1). Distance 4 miles to GHAFUR.

BAHTIAT'I Sir, g 3*7 I have the honour to refer to your telegram No.91 of 13th December, 1948/fegarding the Dubai-Abu Dhabi boundary dispute and to submit the following report upon my investigations and to make certain suggestions regarding a possible solution. 2 * The area under dispute consists of a roughjy rectangular piece of uninhabited desert extending some 25 miles along the coast south west of Jabal Ali and reaching some 40 miles inland in a south easterly direction to the point at which it touches purely tribal territory. For the most part, it comprises low, rolling sandhills relieved only by light scrub and occasional large clumps of trees in the vicinity of wells. This region is passable with difficulty to motor transport. At its southern extremity, however, are large sandhills almost impassable to vehicles, but between them are often found extensive areas of flat, gritty desert presenting no obstacle. With the exception of a few young palm^at Ghafur, there is no evidence of cultivation. In the whole area are found some ten or so wells, but there are no settlements, nor are any parts of it occupier exclusively by anyone bedouin tribe. In order to obtain reliable advice regarding the local conception of sovereignty,! consulted Shaikh Ahmad bin Rashid, Ruler of the small and well governed Sheikhdom of Umm al Qaiwain who, by his high standard of personal integrity and also by virtue of the fact that his State if traditionally 'neutral” in ’local politics, has earned nn small reputation as a mediator amongst the Trucial Shaikhs. Shaikh Ahmad confirmed my opinion that the European conception of sovereignty &gt; over/-- 2 - over territory is largely inapplicable to the Trucial Sheikhdoms. He ^'Sovereign State” is primarily the city or the settlement. To it may belong tribes which travel in ereas far from the city to which they owe allegiance, but the existence of such tribes does not necessarily entitle the ruler to claim sovereignty over the areas which they habitually traverse. Their presence, however, may soratimes serve as an indication of the extent of influence,if not the jurisdiction,of a particular ruler, 4 * Likewise, wells present no absolute indication of sovereignty} whereas the Falaj (or underground water channel) is generally regarded as private property,the well is common property. In the desert, outside the metropolitan area, almost anyone may dig wells and their construction is called M khairat'(i.e., 'good works for the benefit of all”). Only in time of war, is it considered legitimate to deny the use of wells to any man. Thus, one Shaikh may dig wells in a neighbours territory, e.g., Tawi Muhammad bin Saqr, a Sharjah well dug in Dubai territory. 5# In the area under dispute, it would appear that grazing and hunting rights are likewise more or less held in common. It is true that they tend, in different places, to be exercised mainly by the inhabitants of whichever town is nearer, but such rights are no means exclusive. 6 * lt would seem, therefore, that the empty desert lying between the city States may be compared with the high seas, in so far as it forms a sort of no-mans-land which ail may use, but over which, being uncultivable and uninhabited, actual jurisdiction has never been claimed. I would venture to suggest that such a conception of sovereignty may be peculiarly Arab, as would seem to be the case from the way in which the Arab uses the name of the city (being the kernel of the country to den6te the whole State, (e.g., ”Sham” for Damascus or Syria, 'London” for the Capital or for the whole of England.)7 - 3 There is no strong evidence to suggest $hat prior to the arrival of Oil Companies in the Persian Gulf either Dubai or Abu Dhabi saw any reason for claiming exclusively the empty desert lying between their capitals, which for years, has remained a no-mans-land. Only the recently suspected presence of oil has lent this empty desert an intrinsic value and has imposed upon the Shaikhs, the European conception of sovereignty over soil e There is reason to believe that in the past^the fact that both Dubai and Abu Dhabi Shaikhs belong to the Beni Yas tribe has been a unifying factor. Titus, evidence, particularly of the written sort, regarding the past boundaries of the two States, is limited in the extreme, whilst maps shewing all the features such as the permanent sand-masses and wells now claimed by each party, do not exist and the greater part of my work so far has consisted of identifying and placing upon a map points claimed. None of the evidence so far produced by the Shaikhs has been conclusive and I am convinced that any solution which I can put forward is bound to be to a large extent, arbitrary. In the following paragraphs I shall firstly endeavour to examine the historical background to the dispute, secondly the claims themselves, and lastly to submit some possible solutions. 8. The history of the Dubai and Abu Dhabi Sheikhdoms as given on page 763 ff of Volume I of Lorimer^ Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf shows that the independence of Dubai from Abu Dhabi dates from 1833 when the A1 bu Falasah seceders left the latter city and took charge of the already existing city of Dubai which they have ruled ever since. From the outset, the new Sheikhdom seems to have served as a buffer State between the then powerful Jawasim in the North-East and the A1 bu Falah of Abu Dhabi in the South- West. Both the al bu Falah and the al Bu Falasah, however, seem to regard themselves as traditional allies.(being both Beni Yas originally)rather than as enemies and to this day ^ their/-4 their bedouin seem to regard themselves more as Beni Yas B * th ^ r than as permanent subjects of either one Sheikhdom. Whilst, in the latter half of the 19th Century, Abu Dhabi was intent upon extending its influence in the Buraimi area, Dubai was growing in importance as a trading centre, which importance was greatly enhanced when, as from 1902, it became a port of call for steamers from India and Basra, and even to this day, Dubai remains predominantly an entrepot port and a merchant State. In the earlier years of this century, the sorry history of fratricide amongst the rulers of Abu Dhabi, together with the consequent lack of internal security, tended to weaken Abu Dhabi and to confirm the commercial importance of Dubai. The more recent decline of the pearl industry has completed this process. accepted boundary between the two Sheikhdoms lay during the 19th Century. I have, however, heard an unsworn declaration by Shaikh Abdullah bin Muhammad as-Saadi of Asrar Beni Saad, a m i n °r Shaikh of the Batinah, who was produced as a witness by the Shaikh of Dubai. Shaikh Abdullah stated that he was present in iibu Dhabi in about 1890, at a meeting between Shaikh Zaid bin K^alifah of Abu Dhabi and Shaikh Rashid bin Maktum of Dubai at which both rulers verbally agreed that Khor Ghanadha should form their boundary, the Eastern Shore being held by Dubai and the Western Shore by Abu Dhabi. Shaikh Abdullah also stated that the Mediator was Shaikh Ahmad bin Hilal who is now unfortunately dead. The Ruler of Abu Dhabi denies all knowledge of any such meeting having taken place, nor are there any written records extant to prove Shaikh Abdullah's statement. It is, however,interesting to note in this connexion, that on page 454 of Volume II of Lorimer f s Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf, published in 1908, the same boundary is given. (I am, however, inclined to doubt Lorimer's sources of information in this case, since his description of Khor Ghanadha itself is incorrect). I am, furthermore/- 9. There is no indication as to where the generally _/- 5 - furthermore, in complete agreement with the view expressed by Lieut-Colonel Galloway^then Political Agent, Bahrain, to the present Political Resident in his unnumbered letter of 17th January 1947, viz,, that Dubai»s claim to Khor Ghanadha (or presumably to one side of it), is untenable, and I doubt whether the Shaikh of Dubai could seriously defend such a claim. 10. In 1936 at the time when Petroleum Concessions Limited began to show active interest in the potential oil resources of the Trucial Coast, Shaikh Shakhbut bin Sultan of Abu Dhabi and Shaikh Said bin Maktum of Dubai opened negotiations, without the intervention of H.M.G., for the definition of a boundary between the two Sheikhdoms. The mediator was Shaikh Ahmad bin Hilal of whom mention is made in paragraph 4 above. The circumstances of these negotiations are recorded in correspondence resting with the Residency Agent*s memorandum to the Political Agent, Bahrain, No.C/979-19/1 of 6th November, 1937. The one significant result arising out of these otherwise fruitless negotiations is that both rulers agreed upon Ras Hasian, a headland roughly mid-way between their cities as the seaw 8 rd starting point of their boundary. The actual line was never agreed upon, however, Dubai demanding a North-Sout* line and Abu Dhabi claiming one running eastward from Ras Hasian. Whilst both rulers still admit having reached even this measure of agreement, Dubai now claim that they only conceded a starting point as.far as Ras Hasian because /N they were counting on the boundary line running North South, thus giving them extra territory in the South by way of compensation for what they consider they would have lost upon the coast. Abu Dhabi, on the other hand, state that they, as the parent State, had the right to decide the boundary, but that as, at that time, relations between them and Dubai were good (war between the Shaikhdoms not yet having broken out), they were willing M magnanimously to grant/-grant the new-comer a boundary as far West as Has Hasian'. 11. In any case, even had the 1936 negotiations ended in agreement upon the direction of the boundary line, it is doubtful whether any lasting settlement have resulted, as there was no suggestion of eventual demarcation, nor was any turning point in the boundary provided for, nor even, in my experience is the average Trucial Shaikh's definition, of a compass direction sufficiently Aeftei-te to allow a demarcation to be made, 12. Following the breakdown of the 1936 negotiations, no further steps were taken to reach agreement except for the dispute over Khor Ghanadha at the time of the Dubai-Abu Dhabi war (vide correspondence resting with Lieut-Colonel Galloway's letter referred to in paragraph 9 above)y tfntil 1948 when both Shaikhs consented to H.M.G's arbitration (vide Mr.Jackson’s letter No.D.0.640.0266 of 7th June 1948 and the Residency Agent’s Express Letter No.666.0266 of 20th July, 1948) I do not think that further negotiations between the Rulers are possible, so bitter are their feelings following the recent war between them, and I have reason to hope that any decision reached by H.M.G. will be accepted. , 13. In December, 1948, I called upon both Rulers to advance their claims together with any evidence, verbal or otherwise, in support of such claims. The Abu Dhabi claim is based upon what the Shaikh consider to be right of prior possession, and throws the onus of proof upon Dubai. For this reason, he declined to produce detailed written evidence relating to his claim and confined himself to stating that he would 'allow Dubai all territory north of a line drawn East from the Southern slope of Jabal All.' Only when pressed, would he define his claim; then only verbally. His eventual claim is described in appendix 'A' to this despatch. The Shaikh of Dubai, on the other hand, tends/-tends to base his claim upon detailed evidence as constructions of wells and use of territory* The Dubai claim is described in Appendices 'B' and 'C' to this despatch* ^ regret that I am not competent to judge fully the legal aspects of the dispute, but as a matter of convenience, I have based my assessment of the claims and my own recommendations upon the following criteria whose importance I rank in the order shown belows (a) Reliable historical evidence of sovereignty particularly when previously accepted by H.M.G. (b) Independent local evidence, written or verbals reliable independent local opinion* (c) Written evidence produced by either party. (d) Proof of continual exercise of hunting, grazing am camping rights by tribes} construction and continual use of wells by either party. (e) Verbal evidence produced by either party. (f) Proximity of a particular part of the disputed area to the capital of the State claiming it. (g) Convenience from H.M.G»s point of view. 15 • The Abu Dhabi claim at Appendix ,, A ,, presupposes acceptance of their thesis that as parent State, they have the right to dictate Dubai’s boundaries. I consider, however, that since the character of both Dubai and Abu Dhabi has materially changed since their separation, this thesis needs to be treated with reserve. I do, however, agree that the onus of proof of possession lies upon Dubai. ^ consider that by virtue of criteria (d) and (f) above, Dubai can claim the area of the wells Nakhera, Hurra, Marraoum and Hibab and that, therefore, a boundary line as far North as that claimed by Abu Dhabi would be unjust. 17/-- 8 17 • The Dubai claim, likewise, appears unacceptable since it includes Khor Ghanadha at its seaward end and terminates in the South at Tawi Suwaihan (Point 8 in Appendix 'B'), a solitary well over which I cannot agree Dubai to have any special rights. Points 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 a re merely convenient landmarks over which it would be well nigh impossible to substantiate a claim. Their claim to Bada al Mughanni (Point 9) to Khusub (Point 10) and Al Hair (Point 11) is, however, somewhat stronger as these wells are nearer Dubai town and tend to be used to a greater extent by Dubai than is Tawi Suwaihan. IS* I submit for your consideration the following possible solutions. They are:- (a) To accept the Abu Dhabi claim in its entirety. This solution depends upon the value which is to be laid upon their historical claim of prior possession, as opposed to Dubai’s claim based upon use of wells etc. (b) To accept Has Hasian as the dividing mark on the coast, since it was accepted as a starting point by both sides in the 1937 negotiations (vide paragraph 10 above)* From there, a line running South-East to Al Eshush would also approximately split the difference of the Shaikhs' conflicting claims advanced at that time. From al Eshush, the line might run Somhan twid eventually to Hibab, leaving the Nakhera group.of wells within Dubai territory. (c) To accept Has Hasian as starting point and to run the boundary inland to Tawi Semhan, turning northward from there to Hibab. This solution, which I prefer to the others, has the advantage of allowing Dubai such territory (Jabal Ali and the Nakhera group of wells) as she can prove a claim to with any certainty. 19* In my investigations, I have deliberately ignored such information as I may have received from Messrs.Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Limited regarding the potential oil/-oil the area, since I consider that any definition of a boundary based on geological considerations could more properly be made at a higher level. I realise, however, that the solution which I propose in paragraph 9 (c)above may allot a valuable potential oil-field to one party or the other for rather tenuous reasons. If this proves to be the case, I would suggest that the whole of the area between the claims be regarded as a neutral zone in which both Shaikhs would have equal rights in respect of oil royalties. In the long run, a neutral zone might simplify, rather than complicate the problem, for the following reasons (a) Neither ruler could claim that a valuable piece of virtual no-mans-land had been awarded to the other without overwhelming proof. (b) Common interest in the area would encourage both rmlers to cooperate with the Company in the development of the oilfield. This would lessen the possibility of intrigue interfering with the Company's operations. (c) The disputed area has in fact been treated as a sort of 'Neutral Zone' by Messrs.Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Limited during their explorations there, and their personnel and equipment have been guarded by watchment from both Shaikhs. TJiis arrangement has been satisfactory. An extension of this principle to the process r ’f actual oil production should, therefore, prove easy to effect. (d) To declare the disputed area a neutral zone politically would be in harmony with the present local attitude towards wells, grazing and hunting rights. 20 • As the whole of the disputed area is of potential interest to Oil Companies, prompt and accurate demarcation of whatever boundaries are decided upon will be essential. Unfortunately Messrs. Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Limited's 1/40 000 Map on which I recorded my investigations has/**- 10 - has proved to contain a distortion of about 2 miles in the Area of the Jabal Ali and it would appear necessary for the eventual boundary to be marked on the ground first and to be recorded on a map afterwards. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant Political Officer, Trucial Coast, Shar.lah, C. J. Pelly, Esquire, O.B.E., Political Agent, ^ Bahrain.APPENDIX 'A'. DUBAI-ABU DHABI BOUNDARY DISPUTE. ABU DHABI CLAIM, On 17th and 18th February, 1949, I examined the boundaries claimed by Abu Dhabi. I was accompanied by Shaikhs Hazza and Zayid, brothers of the Ruler and by Shaikh Muhammad bin Khalifah, his cousin. The features Jabal All, Yilayls, Tawi Nakhera, Tawi Murra and Tawi Hibab are fairly accurately shown on Fallon^ map and therefore the intermediate landmarks which I have myself plotted should also be reasonably accurately placed. All bearings shown are true, not magnetic as in minute on Dubai claim. Distances are taken in direct line. The bounadry claimed is as follows:- (1) A point on the coast at the lattitude of Jabal All. Jabal All therefore bears 90°. (2) Bearing 102° from (1), distance 3£ miles, a point on track between Abu Dhabi and Dubai approximately 1 mile East North East of 2 trees at AL NUWAIBI. Summit of Jabal Ali bears 55°. (3) Boundary claimed follows southern contour of Jabal Ali as far as BU KHUMALA ( ) Sandhill at bearing 88 ° and distance 2i miles from (2). Jabal Ali bears 305°. (4) Bearing 85° from (3), distance 3i miles, JURN AL AWAMIR ( yl Jj*) sandhill. Jabal Ali bears 276°. (5)Bearlng 135° from (4), distance If miles, KHUBAX AL MOTAW'EH ( * 3 lixjI ) sandhill. Jabal AH bears 286°. 0 ( 6 ) Bearing 150 from (5), distance 3i miles, OUD AL BIYADHA ( 4 —* L-JI Jj*) sandhill. Yilayis ridge (not to be confused with the '‘Yilayis” shown in Dubai claim) appears 2 miles due south. (7) Bearing 94° from ( 6 ), distance 14 miles to disused TAWI NAKHFRA situated in a large area of trees and scrub, 1 mile East lies a further well still in use.Nakhera is shown on Fallon’s map, ( 8 ) Bearing 122° from (7), distance 2£ miles, TAWI HURRA. Well surrounded by trees. (9) Bearing 53 from ( 8 ), distance, distance 4 miles, TAW I MARMOUM ( ^ ) • Well. (10) Bearing 48° from (9), distance 5£ miles, TAWI HIBAB. Well. The Abu Dhabi Shaikhs did not appear to know the area well, and the only bedouin encountered claimed to be from Dubai’s tribes. Whatever the historical claim to this territory, I do not consider that Abu Dhabi can claim to have continually used territory as far north as Hibab. The Shaikhs could advance no specific claim (other than the general historical claim), to the group of wells Nakhera, Hurra, Marmoum and Hibab. Furthermore, their proximity to Dubai (20-25 miles) inevitably means that they are more generally in use by Dubai than by Abu Dhabi. See map at Appendix D.(M \ APPENDIX 'H'. DUBAIsABU DHABI BOUNDARY DTSPriTK DUBAI CLAIM. ^2 &gt; 91 On the 28th and 29th January, 1949, I examined the areas of Dubai claim, accompanied by Shaikh Rashid of Dubai.

(10) Bearing 70° from (9). Distance 5 miles KHUSUB ( ^ ). (11) Bearing 70° from (10). Distance 6 miles AL HAIR ( ). This represents the extremity of the Dubai claim. The country to the north west of Tuwi Suwaihan is almost uniformly barren and I cannot imagine that it has been in use much by anyone. Shaikh Rashid did not appear to &gt;ncw it will. Bada al Mughanni, however, appears to be used by Dubai. F r om there, I went to Al Eshush (Bearing 310° 8 miles) and spent the night at Shaikh Said bin Maktum’suf - 2 - hunting camp. He claims well was built by Ma’adhad bin Saif of Dubai. On the morning of the 29th January, I left A1 Eshush for Sharjah via Hafir, Ghafur, Leian, Ram ar Ram, Kameran and Jabal Ali. Dubai claim all these points as lying well within their territory. The route was as follows (1) From A1 Eshush ( J*y~ distance 10 miles to HAFIR ( with 2 trees. ), bearing 280°, ) we 11 (2) Bearing 340 from (1). Distance 4 miles to GHAFUR ( j t -* ).

' I am not inclined to believe that Tawi Suwaihan is much used by Dubai, both on account of its distance from that city, and from the apparent difficulty experienced by the Dubai Shaikhs in identifying it. On the other hand, A1 Eshush, Hafir and Ghafur appear to be used to a considerable extent by Dubai. See map at Appendix M D HAPPENDIX 'C'. Translation of letter dated the 12th January, 1949, from Shaikh Sai’d bin Maktum, O.B.E., Ruler of Dubai, to Mr. P.D.Stobart, Political Officer, Trucial Coast, Sharjah. After Compliments. Reference your letter No.lOTB dated the 16th December 1948 corresponding to the 15th Safar 1368 saying that the Political Agent has asked you that I should supply * you with a full statement about my boundary with Abu Dhabi. In compliance with the Political Agent's wishes, I submit below the following details On the sea my boundary starts from Khor Ghanadha southwards to Barqa al Hadhibah, then to Yilayis, then to Naqa Banna, then to Naqa al Hugf, then to Ramlat al Zimaimah, then to Shamtoot and Ghafat al Zinad and then to Tuwi Suwaihan. The line then turns eastwards to Bada al Mughanni, ' then to Tuwi al Khusub and from Tuwi al Khusub to Al Hair. These are the boundaries separating my country from Abu Dhabi which I claim. In support thereof I quote the following grounds Firstly: As regards my boundaries from the sea side, I have already supplied you with sufficient evidence and proofs which I was able to obtain and which were contained in my letters dated the 14th Rabi al Awwal 1365 corresponding to the 17th Febaary 1946, the 21st Rabi al Awwal 1365 corresponding to the 24th February 1946 and the 2nd Jamad al Awwal 1365 corresponding to the 6th April 1946. Secondly: As regards my boundaries from the land side, my subjects were and are still frequenting these places for grazing, watering and dwelling and other purposes. No other ruler objected or obstructed them. Thirdly: I have myself dug the well at Bada al Mughanni and no one objected or obstructed me. Fourthly: No incidents took place in these areas which might give others the right to their ownership.Fifthly: My previous discussions with the Ruler of Abu Dhabi about the boundaries do not constitute a proof that I demanded something to which I was not entitled but I used to negotiate with him in order to obtain from him more land than the boundaries which I now claim, I had discussed with him at that time to grant me land extending up to Ansuriyah which lies within his territory. The mediator, Shaikh Ahmad bin Muhammad bin Hilal, promised to get me what I demanded. Later, however, he brought me a letter from the Ruler of Abu Dhabi but when I read it I found that it was contradictory to what was discussed. I, therefore, returned the letter to him. I still maintain my claim to the boundaries mentioned above. Sixthly: I have no documents or papers about the bounadries, as it has not been the custom here to write out documents or papers and especially in the old days when confidence existed among the people who used to trust each other. Executing documents was then unnecessary, rather strange. Furthermore, it was not expected that there will arise a dispute over the boundaries so that one could take the necessary precautions. Most of the transactions of the Trucial people used to be conducted verbally and a few of them maintained records and kept documents after having done with them.

A Sir, I have the honour to enclose herewith a /dopy of the Political Officer, Trucial Coast*s report on the proposed boundary between the Shaikhdoms of Dubai and Abu Dhabi, and of its enclosures, and to submit the following comments:- J j c (1) The Abu Dhabi argument that, because Dubai seceded from the Sheikhdom 116 years ago, the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi has, 7 ; therefore, merely to state his claim c in order that it should be accepted, has, I think, been cleverly canvassed by the Abu Dhabi Shaikhs to the various Englishmen, like Messrs. Bird and Thesiger who have been on the Trucial Coast during the last few years; and it is possible that this is the reason that it has been given, to my mind, an exaggerated importance by the Political Officer, Trucial Coast, in his report. It would be as valid to argue (and as unreal and as little likely to be acceptedl) that the 'onus” of proof in the boundary dispute between Eire and the United Kingdom, is on Eire, because that country seceded from the United Kingdom. A Shaikhdom which has been independent, at any rate in the Trucial Coast sense, for 116 years cannot be treated as if it were a part of seceded territory. (2) Not.only, as stated by the Political Officer, Trucial Coast, at page 464, paragraph 2 of Lorimer, is Khor Ghanadhah indicated as the meeting point of the boundaries of Abu Dhabi and Dubai, but this has also been stated at pages 406 and 406. I have failed to find wherein, as stated by Mr.Stobart, Lorimer , s description of Khor Ghanadhah is incorrect; and in any case whether it is or not is irrelevant to the point at issue. Further more, I am not wholly convinced of the soundness of the reasons adduced by Col.Galloway (in his letter quoted by Mr. Stobart), for / £. - - HS4r 2 - jettisoning the venerable authority • of Lorimer and for deciding that there is 'no room for doubt that the Khor Ghanadhah is in Abu Dhabi territory', Col. Galloway’s comments on paragraph 4 of the Shaikh of Dubai’s claim enclosed with his letter do not seem to be correct, since in the map received with the Political Officer, Trucial Coast’s • despatch, Hasyan is shown North East of Ghanadhah. (3) The Political Officer, Trucial Coast, relies rightly, I think, on, inter alia, the criterion given in paragraph 14(d) of his dispatch, in considering a claim to sovereignty. Yet, while applying this in favour of Dubai at paragraph 16 in respect of the wells forward his suggestion for a boundary line - in the case of the one solution ('c') which is most favourable to Dubai; for while admitting in the last paragraph of his Appendix 'B' that the wells of A1 Eshush, Hafir and Ghafur 'appear to be used to a considerable extent by Dubai', he nevertheless includes them in Abu Dhabi territory. The same comment applies to a lesser extent to the remarks made by the Political Officer, Trucial Coast, in the last sentence of paragraph 17 of his dispatch, and in the second para graph of Appendix E regarding Dubai’s claim to Bada al Mughanni and points 10 and 11 (Khushub and Al Khair). 2. Where proofs are practically speaking unobtainable, as in the present case, we might follow the principle of giving in alternatively to each of the claimants. This would take Khor Ghanadhah away from Dubai and start the line at Rasyan, but while terminating it at Eshush it should include that point and also Tawi Ghafur and Tawi Hafir in Dubai territory. It would then be about 46 kilometres long and there seems to be no necessity for carrying it further northwards at present. Incidentally this line will meet the wishes of the Oil Company as indicated in the enclosure to my printed letter No.C/R-68 dated the 27th Feb. 1949. i *-« v Nakhera, Murra, Marmoum and Hibab, I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant NNR POLITICAL AGENT, BAHRAIN.P.P.6.47 ( Telegrams: PETCONCESS, BAHREIN ^|I7 Codes : BENTLEY’S SECOND PHRASE PETROLEUM DEVELOPMENT (Trucial Coast) LIMITED 2.

It is important to know whether these tawis consist of single wells or groups of wells, and if they are used as points for describing the boundary, it will be necessary to say on which side of the boundary they should be deemed to lie. It will also be important to define their exact location geogra phically at an early date in case one party or the other may dig fresh wells in an effort to obtain a divergence of the boundary in its favour. 6.

I enclose a copy of an identical letter'from the Political Agent, Bahrain, to the Rulers of Dubai and Abu Dhabi announcing to them the position in the case of their boundary dispute. 3. On the 1st of June as Political Officer, Truc3al Coast, I announced to Shaikhs Said and Rashid of Dubai the Political Agent's decision and handed them his letter. They made some half-hearted protestations atout 'having to accept a very hard ruling from the British Government', but I think that, on the whole, the Dubai ueople will be happy enough of the result. 4. On the 2nd of June I ?/ent to Abu Dhabi and there saw Sheikh Shakhbut and his three brothers. I handed Shaikh Shakhbut Mr. Felly's letter and also explained its contents to him myself. The Shaikh be^arv*extremely exited and complained that 'his State was being dismembered by us and that Dubai was being rewarded for their past aggression and present slave trading by being granted the wells at Hafir, Ghafur, and Eshush, and that he now expected them to try to extend their influence westward to Abu Dhabi and eastward to Buraimi. I tried to make him see reason but without success. His. Excellency Sir Rupert Hay, KCIE, CSI, Political Resident, Persian Gulf, BAHRAIN.} i - 2 - 5. I think that Shaikh Shakhbut is not so much worried about the possible loss of oil-bearing ter ritory (indeed he appears to have enough of that already) as by the fact that two and possibly three wells, the only ones in that region, have been definitely put on the Dubai side of the border line. This represents considerable loss of prestige amongst his bedouin. 6. Shaikh Zaid, his brother, who seemed the only member oi the family able to discuss the matter intel ligently, eventually formulated the Abu Dhabi objection as follov/s: (a) After the Ghanadha incident in 1945, the only line which the Dubai forces attempted to hold was Jet el Ali to Marmoum, well north of the line now announced. (b) At the beginning of the Dubai - Abu Dhabi war the Dubai forces made an incursion into the Abu Dhabi territory at Eshush and there looted Shakhbut 1 * camels. (c) li*eir own camels were at the present grazing at Ghafur without let or hindrance from Dubai. Hence forth this would be impossible. 7. Whilst I think that the decision once announced must be adhered to and that an appeal is out of the question, I can see that the fact that the line terminates abruptly at Eshush must cause Shakhbut considerable worry, since the assumption is that any continuation of the line at a later date would be in the same direction. This causes them to be anxious about Buraimi. I would, there fore strongly urge that, at an early date, we announce to both sides the continuation of the line which should be from Eshush to Hibab as suggested in paragraph 18 (b) of Political Officer, Trucial Coast*s despatch No.369.0256mm of the Slid April j 1949, a copy of which was forv/arded to you under Pel3y*s despatch No.C/R-16S-38/17 of the 25t. April, 194S• I think this would probably re-assure Sheikh Shakhbut and would discourage him from taking tne law into his own hands in that area which is a pos sibility if he becomes too frightened about his security.

Before issuing the second order I should like, if I may, to resume the Dubai - Abu Dhabi boundary position so as to get it clear in my own mind. ^ &gt; 3. Felly did not leave any precise record of the consi derations that guided him in fixing the frontier at Hasian to A1 Eshush but in paragraph 2 of his despatch to you No.C/R-168- 3S/17 of April 25th he does refer to giving in alternatively to each of the claimants. Then taking Hasian as the agreed point of departure he seems to have struck a balance between the two extreme claims and to have drawn what Stobart in a minute dated December last referred to as an 'arbitrary line at right angles to the coast'. 4. A1 Eshush lay on this line but Tawi Ghafur and Tawi Hafir which were on the Abu Dhabi side of it he gave to Dubai presumably because Stobart had reported that they 'appear to be used to a considerable extent by Dubai'. But Stobart tells me that it would be equally true to say that they appear to be used to a considerable extent by Abu Dhabi. And if we are to be swayed by this consideration we might equally put the second part of the frontier through Bada A1 Mughanni, Khusub and A1 Hair which Stobart equally reports Dubai as using (and would doubtless report that Abu Dhabi are using). , fVy 5. Since I started drafting this note a letter has come in from Dubai accepting the first part of the frontier with some satisfaction and I wonder whether it would commend itself to you to hold up the announcement of the second part of the frontier until we are sure of Abu Dhabi*s reactions to the first part. If we are going back on a decision (and I gather that you are reserving your personal intervention for that eventuality) would it not be better to go back on one decision instead of two? 6. Would you agree to my writing to Abu Dhabi saying that I have had no acknowledgement from him of Felly*s letter and await his written acceptance of the decision. If he reacts violently the matter might be referred to you for arbitration. If he accepts we might then announce the second part of the frontier. 7. My maps of the district are small and not very adequate and on these the Hasian - A1 Eshush - Hisab line seems to form an awkward salient. If that were indeed the case it would better perhaps be avoided but I assume that on a large scale map the proposed frontiers fit in reasonably enough. 8. I notice in connection with sea-bed oil it was laid down 'whatever principle is adopted, it will obviously be important that it should look equitable on the map as well as be equitable in principle.'

I was anxious to get the whole Dubai - Abu Dhabi boun- dary settled before Pelly ! s and Stobart’s departure, vide ^ my letter 160/5/49 of the 17th May, and as Stobart reported that the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi was much upset by the decision already announced and as he also gave it as his opinion that the Shaikh feared that it was our intention to continue the boundary already defined in a south-easterly direction and that he would be reconciled to it when he realised it was to turn north-east from A1 Eshush, T authorised him to pass an order fixing the further portion of the boundary as running from A1 Eshush to Hibab. He was, however, unable to do this before you took over. 3. As you are now the responsible officer I must leave it to you to decide whether to fix the rest of the boundary at once or to leave it until you have obtained further local information. I would, in any case, deprecate any pressure being put to the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi to reply to Pelly’s letter for the time being. 4. If after further examination of the case you find your self able to inform the two rulers concerned that although you cannot define the rest of the boundary without further examination on the spot, it will in any case not proceed south-east of A1 Eshush for any appreciable distance, but will turn in a north-easterly direction, it will I think ease matters so far as Abu Dhabi is concerned.

Nill you please refer to your letter C/TC- 6 of 9th January regarding the Dubai-Abu Dhabi boundary dispute. 2. I understand privately from Henderson that Shakhhut*s Violent protests last summer about the boundary decision might veil have been made on principle and that he really believes that justice has been done even if only for the reason that H.M.G. througihly examined the claims of both sides. I have cause to hope that he may eventually signify his acceptance of the avard. 3. My reason for recommending last June that ve should announce a continuation of the line, vas that if H.M.G. did not do so, Shakhbut vould assume that any future extension must necessarily be made in the same South Easterly direction as the original Hasian Eshush line and might therefore end up in Buraimi. Such a line vould not, of course, be H.M.G*s intention and the fear of this contingency might encourage him to take th*—l-in-e into his ovn lands. I suggested Hibab, because that\ vas about the most Easterly point of proven Dubai territory. I can, on consideration, nov see tvo objections to this: (a) As Jakins points out, a line Eshush to Kibab creates an unnatural salient on the ground, quite irrespective of any map (b) Because ve define the territory of Dubai as lying north of a line Hasian-Eshush-Hibab, it does not necessarily follov that every thing south of the line belongs to Abu Dhabi. These may veil be a considerable area of purely tribal territory in betveen the tvo States, (e.g. Beni Ka ! ab). 4. As I see it, the Trucial Shaikhdoms are in the nature of lobes of territory extending inland into purely tribal territory from the Rulers 1 capitals only so far as these Rulers can assert their authority, and vhilst the land may be neatly divided betveen tvo States from the coast as far inland as Eshush, for example, such a division becomes more difficult the further inland one goes. 5. We majr therefore do one or tvo things, either (a) Having prevented, ve hope, a dispute over the ownership of the potential oilfield in the Jabel Ali area, ve might let the matter rest. C.J.

Apparently there is some urgency about this, as they wish to use 2000 tons of shale from Jebel Ali in conrucion with their drilling operations in Abu Dhabi and In order to transport this material, a metalled road will have to be laid over certain san^y patches on the route. They are anxious to construct a beacon at the exact point at which the line Hasian- Ghafur cuts the Dubai-Abu Dhabi track in order to avoid disputes as to ownership of the territoiywhen they come to construct this road. I am going to Hasian and Ghafur tomorrow with their surveyor to determine the exact position at which the first leg of the boundary should start and finish. 3. Eventually, a concrete beacon beside the track will be necessary, and this, Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) are willing to build. Do you see any objection to their building it, or should I try to get Holloway Bros to build one after the Oil Company surveyor has determined the position ?

I again wrote to the Ruler of Abu Dhabi asking him to signify his acceptance of the Boundary Award, but failed to get a satisfactory reply. Copies of my letter and its reply are enclosed. , 7,3 3. On 10th February I took up the question personally with Shaikh Shakhbut, and called his attention to his previous undertaking to accept the decision (vide Jackson’s D.O.No. 540-0256 of 7th June 1948). 4. He and his brothers used the usual illogical arguments * about ’’dismemberment” and asked whether he should be expected M to signify his agreement to such dismemberment. I informed him that there could be no question of reconsidering an award once made and said that if he was not going to honour his obligations, His Majesty’s Government would not be prepared to help him obtain the arms for which he had asked. I think that in the long run, this refusal will probably produce from him an assurance that he will respect the Boundary but he will no doubt express himself at length about ’’accepting a hard decision only because it is His Majesty's Government’s”. 5. In his present obtuse state of mind, Shakhbut is unable to differentiate between accepting the award as a fact and withdrawing his former claim, and I imagine that this is the reason for his failure to accept the award. K 6. Meanwhile, I do not think that he would be foolish enough to start any trouble if P.C.L. were to begin drilling operations in Dubai territory immediately to the south of Jebel Ali. 7.

I have now consulted Stobart, both in writing and verbally, and am able to reply to your letter 160/15/49 of 21st November, 1949, on the subject of Dubai - Abu Dhabi boundary. 2. I would like to continue the line from A1 Eshush to Hibab except for a consideration first brought to my no tice by Stobart, i.e., if we do so, it almost implies that the area to the south east of the line falls to Abu Dhabi. &gt; But in fact that area is tribal territory held, amongst others, by Beni Ka*ab. In the Saudi Arabian frontier nego tiations therefore, if they were to come to anything, we might, having declared the Dubai frontier, be forced into trying to maintain that Abu Dhabi controlled territory which we know certainly that it does not control; while with the frontier undefined we are atleast in the position of being able to say that that is the case and to leave the question of control in the air. 3. Another consideration is that it might be better to wait until the levy force is established before laying down any further frontiers unless oil operations necessitated it. 4. Shaikh Shakhbut has refused in writing to accept my award and I enclose copies of the correspondence between ' himself and Stobart. of questions now-a-days. I will take up the question with him myself. 5. The point made by Jakins in paragraph 7 of his letter He has been very tiresome about a number No.C/R-284 of 5th July, 1949, to you is not important. \ Whatever ....

If the boundaries were defined, Dubai would be no more an 'awkward salient' than is Belgium between the Netherlands and France. Yourrs sincerely,BAHRAIN. 15th karch, 1950. % y I concur in the^- reason advanced in your letter No.C/R-115 of the 4th karch for not defining any line between aI Ashush aiid Hibab as a boundary between Dubai iibu Dhabi. sooner or later we may have to fix it as a boundary between Dubai and tribal territory, out presumably we need be in no hurry to ao this. and 2. Do you think we ought to take advantage of tne knowledge Btobart has ac quired of local affairs to proceed with the definition of other boundaries in the Trucial Coast, e.g. that between Dubai and oharjah? The fact that a concession is likely to be granted in tne near future for the Dubai sea-bed really makes it necessary that this boundary should be defined, at any rate in the vicinity of the coast.
