For Instance every cow is served by two bulls; the cows are kept permanently tied up since their appearence in public is believed to expose them to the evil eye; and castration ia a completely unknown art. 3* We could quite easily get a cattle breeding farm goingin Budalya, but if it is to be a real success it must be popularised and it would be as well to enlist the active interest of the Shaikh* The only way I can think of doing this effectively ia to enquire whether His Excellency the Viceroy would consider presenting two selected stud bulls to His Highness for the purpose of starting off a properly organised cattle-breeding eetabliehnent. His Highness would of course be quite delighted, nnd by enlisting his active Interest we might hope to break down some of the local shibboleths which have been responsible for the deteriotation of Bahrain cattle. 4* If it is thought improper to make such a proposal we &lt;r can/ i*ajor C.Q* Prior, C*I*?'j*, I*A*, Political Heoident in the Persian Gulf, Camp Bahrain*can of course arrange for the purchase of good stud bulls; and the present seems to be the most appropriate moment for getting going since v»e have serving *ith the Bahrain Government Captain Byard who is not only interested but has some experience of breeding.

Now that Ware, the Animal Husbandry Expert, has expressed his view that the Sindh cattle are the most suitable for Bahrain, the Bahrain Government will no doubt concentrate their efforts upon them, and abandon their proposal to import animals of the Rath breed, if it is not too late. So far as I know, there will be no difficulty in obtaining extra cattle of the Sindh breed. H.

The Rath animals, he adds, are medium sized grey animals with potentialities as dual purpose animals, but so far ▼ ry little develop- 2. As to the selection of a suitable breech r. #are t ment of the breed has been undertaken. He therefore thinks.... •» •2* thinks it would be very di ficult, if not impossible* to find a pedigree bull of this breed suitable for His Excellency’s presentation. 4. Sj;. Ware recotot ends the Sindh breed which has ueen greatly developed for milch purposes. The animals of this breed are of the same size and colour as those of Bahrain and he considers that they should do weil for breeding purposes. His Excellency has accepted the recommendation and arrangements «e being made to select a suitable pedigree Sindh bull in Karachi for presentation. His Excellency wishes it to be made clear that his bull is selected as a contribution towards improving the local breed, end not as a mate for the females of the Hath strain which are about to be imported into Bahrain.

Z am sending a copy of your letter to ^eightmon, and I am suggesting to him that the State would do better to buy additional bulla from the Sindh breed, and cancel the order for Rath animals if they have not already been shipped to Bahrain, The Bahrain QoTernment were importing the Rath cattle partly because they were much cheaper than the local cattle and it profitable to bring them in apart from fcny question of breeding. Obviously, however, now expert’s advice has been obtained it will be i^ thev'lnterests to concentrate on the Sindh breed. s.

Could you kindly write to the Department concerned and obtain their advice as to how many goats one should start with as an experiment? The local goats are kept for milking, those used for meat are imported and killed after they have been here a few weeks. What is mainly needed here is good milkers. Yours sincerely, Major R.G.E.W.
