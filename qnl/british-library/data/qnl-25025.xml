Brititih Crown Colonies mo Protectorates. v^itn respect to the enquiry in the last paragraph of your letter, I am to observe that the Customs exemp tions accorded to His Majesty's Consular officers in the foreign countries mentioned may be divided general ly into two classes, viis:- (1) on the baggage end personal effects of the Consul when he arrives in the Country;. on offiel^x stores etc., sent by His Mujes- ty f s Government for the use of the Consulate. As regards the grant of reciprocal treatment, provision Under Secretary of State, Colonial Office.(4038/10) | provision (1) woulo apparently have no application in the cases, referred to in your letter, where the Consu lor officer appointed oy the foreign country is a Bri tish subject, already resident in the Colony, and en gaged in trade. It appears, moreover, from recent —■ —— correspondence with your Department that in the aelf- poverning ^°l on ies, Australia, Canada and the Cape, such privileges are confined to Consuls who are not en gaged in any other business or profession. In any case therefore Sir E.

With ^ard to ( 2 ) - Exemptions from duties on official stores sent by the foreign Government for the U88 ° f the Gon6ul&amp;te , E.

S^i+S. / My dear Hastings:- / We have duly received your 'official* of the 20th. instant and I gather from yours to me of the same date that you only want a semi-official reply to it. Correspondence enclosed in the official let ter treats of two distinct points: 1. The concrete case of the safe for the French Consul-General at Calcutta and similar privi leges for French Consuls in India. to he accorded to the United States, Mexico and Cuba. This is quite a separate matter with which we need not concern ourselves at present. 2. The question of the reciprocal advantages AsAs regards* the first point there seems to he some discrepancy between what the French Consul-General says is done for our Consuls in France and what our Ambassa dor reported in 1904 when,in response to a Circular of inquiry sent from here, Sir E. Monson said that no exemp tion from Customs duties was granted on stores for use of Consuls except by courtesy in case of their first installation. The French Consul-General at Calcutta appears to have referred the matter to his Government and it is possible therefore that the French Government may ad dress us on the subject. But unless and until they do so we see no objection to the Government of India await ing a further communication from the French Consul- General and to their being guided in their treatment of thesethese matters according to the information he supplies. We should like however to he informed in due course of any further developments./£f / / . , V 'W /c. Ho.524-3,H., dated Calcutta, the 14th August 1909. From - H.

It will be seen, however, from the Consul General’s letter of 27th July that he belives a similar concession to be allowed to British Consuls in French territories, and can speak of his own knowledge to its hewing granted in one of the French possessions. I have the honour therefore to suggest that the matter may be referred for the orders of the Government of India. It will be seen that the Consul General has referred the matter to his Government.

Hating regard to the practice followed by the Government ot India in these matters, as explained in your Foreign Letter No. 68, dated 1st May 1902, and to the information given in the Foreign Office letter of the 22nd ultimo as to the customs privileges accorded by the Dutch Government, I am disposed to accede to the present request.

In reply I am to say that, having regard to the practice of treating these matters reciprocally, \ iscount Morley, before expressing an opinion, would be glad to be informed whether the privileges specified in the Netherland Minister’s note may be taken as applying not only to the Dutch East Indies and Colonial possessions, but to the Netherlands generally. If the grant of the privileges is not general, the question arises .whether the Government of India should be asked to accord facilities, and on this point Lord Morley would be glad to be favoured with Sir E. Grey’s views. I have, &amp;c., The Under Secretary of State, A. Godlf.y. Foreign Office. Enclosure No. 3. Foreign Office to India Office. No. 1G,73G. Foreign Office, Sir, 22nd May 1908. I am directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th instant, respecting the grant of exemption from customs duties to Dutch consular officers in British India. It appears to Sir Edward that the extent of reciprocity which British India is entitled to claim, is fulfilled by the issue of the Decree by the Netherland Governor-General, and that it is not strictly necessary to make enquiry as to the practice prevailing in the Netherlands proper.

Tours very trulyDear Ritchie:- In reply to your letter of the 17th Instant respecting the claim of the Russian Consul General at Bombay for exemptlon from Customs duty on his personal and household effects, there has, so far as we are aware, been no change in the position of the question of such exemptions since Sir Eldon Gorst’s letter of March 29th, 1905, to which you allude. His Majesty’s Government could not claim, as a matter of right, the privileges which the Con sular officers of other States enjoy by virtue of ConsularConsular Conventions; and I therefore think you may certainly reply to sir L. Dane as you propose. I have been away for a brief space, or would have replied before. Yours very sincerely. c&lt;r-d(.CftlruHft The z 7 March 19 07. M. Polcvtsoff, the Russian Consul General at Borlbi.--, has .shed to Be exempted from the payment of Custoras duty on his personal and household effects, which he imported on his recent appointment to India. The Bombay Government told him that articles for the official use of Consuls are alone admitted free of duty, and that this concession is only made in the oase of those countries which grant a similar concession to British Consuls. M. Polovtsoff then asked if he is not ’’entitled to treatment similar to the one accordedaccorded to British Consuls in Hussia, and if not, for what reasons” , the inference being that British Consuls ^ Russia are exerapted from customs duty on their personal and household effects. We do not appear to have any information showing whether British Consuls in Russia are allowed this privi lege, and I am accordingly desired to ask if you will be kind enough to let us know what the practice is in this respect.

V: The Foreign Office has to Inform Hie Britannic Majesty's Embassy in reply to the Verbale Note of the 15th December, 1903 that the assurances given by His Excellency the Ambassador in his corrmunication of the 13th August last year, with reference to the Free Ad mission of Imperial Consular Stores into the British Dominions are considered by them till further notice as sufficient, in order to satisfy the necessary legal requirements of reciprocity for the free admission of similar scores for British Consulates within the Em pire. And therefore the necessary steps have been taken to ensure corresponding treatment of these stores. On this occasion it should be observed that from a despatch received here from the Imperial German Con sul in Sydney of the 20th October of last year, a con signment of writing paper destined for trie use of the Consulate General was partially taxed, notwithstanding The the Br itlsh finbassv.the protests of the Consul General, a fact which does not seem to agree with the guarantees given by the British Government as to the treatment of similar stores.

I an directed 'by the Marquees of Lanedowne to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 22nd in which you enquire whether any special Customs privileges are accorded hy the German Gov ernment to His Majesty’s Consular Officers in Germany and the German Colonies. I am to state, in reply, that it would appear from information which has been obtained semi-offi- cially from His Majesty’s Embassy at Berlin, and com- s muni cated to your Department, that all foreigners settling permanently in Germany are permitted to im port their used household effects free of duty, and that 'Consuls de Carriers' being treated as if they were 'settlers', obtain this privilege, in practice, but that no special Regulations exist on the subject. I am to add that these facts, taken in conjunc tionconjunction with the statement made in Count Berns- torff’s Note of August 30th last (a copy of which accompanied the letter from this Department of Sep tember 5th) amount in effect to a reciprocal equiva lent of the concessions granted to Mr. Hopman and Count Quadt, and may, in Lord Lansdowne's opinion, he accepted as sufficient. It should, moreover, he home in mind that His Majesty*s Government cannot claim, as a matter of right, special privileges in regard to taxation etc. which Consuls of States having Consular Conventions with Germany enjoy; hut that, as in some matters.

Do foreign Consuls de carriere enjoy special privileges in regard to the treatment by the Customs of their * removal effects* (Umzugsgut) i.e. are they permitted to introduce into Germany free of duty ar ticles of personal use and household furniture in larger quantities than other foreign subjects coming oo Germany to stay for several years in a private t capacity? In reply to I, Foreign Consuls de carriere en joy legally no privileges in respect of the treatment by the Customs of their removal effects. They may only introduce articles of personal use and household furniture to the same amount as other foreigners who come to reside permanently in Germany. The regulations on this subject run as follows:- § 5 of the Customs Tariff Lav; of July 15th, 1879 (Issue of May 24th, 1885, Reichsgesetzblatt p.112, also subsequent alterations): *The following articles 'enter free of duty if the conditions laid down for ■them■them arc fulfilled:- 'No .1 No..;,, (i) Articles of clothing and v/ashing 'linen, used, v/hich are not introduced 'for purposes of sale. '(2) Used household utensils and ef« 'fects, used manufacturing implements and 'tools destined for the personal use of 'the settlers. ' ( 3 ) • § 114 of the Union Customs Law of July 1st, :&gt;o9: 'Exemption from Customs dues may be granted 'if articles are introduced from abroad for tempor- j ary use and are subsequently re-exported.' The following remarks may be made In regard to these regulations: Among the 'Articles of clothing and washing linen* mentioned in § 5 No.2 (1) of the Tariff Law arc included boots and shoes, hats, gloves, uni forms, shawls, underlinen and other washing linen, in fact all articles which serve for clothing pur posespurposes. By 'Household utensils and effects' in the sense of No .2 are understood all moveable articles, according to a ruling of the Prussian Minister of Finance of October 26th, 1806, III 15045. Only those foreigners are regarded as settlers within the meaning of the regulation quoted, v/ho in tend to reside permanently in the country, and have announced their intention to do so in the manner pre scribed by law. By § 114 of the Union Customs Lav; the possibility is provided for of extending the free entry of,removal effects, by application to the administrative authori ties, in two respects, namely to:- (a) The used household utensils and effects of those foreigners who only desire to reside temporarily in the Customs territory, i.e. who cannot be regarded as settlers v/ithin the strict meaning of the Tariff Law. (b) Unused household utensils and effects. The extension (a) is generally only granted by the Prussian Customs Administration in return for a guaranteeguarantee of the import duties v/hich may eventually fail due i .e. in return for security or a guarantee that the articles of removal of the foreigner set tling only temporarily in Prussia will either be re exported or pay duty when he goes away again, and a limit of time, subject to eventual extension, with in which the departure and re-export has to take place, is appointed in all cases. The extension (b) is refused on principle by the Prussian Customs Authorities. In both respects (a) and (b) foreign Consuls de Carriers are however more favourably treated than private persons when they settle in Prussia. In the first place, in so far as they take up their residence within the Customs Territory without any definite limit of time for the purpose of their of ficial duties, they are always regarded as 'set tlers' within the meaning of the Tariff law, and their removal effects are therefore allowed to pass through the customs free unconditionally i.e, v/ith- oiiu ios being necessary for them to undertake to re-exportre-export the articles they have imported, when they leave the country; in contradistinction to other for eigners their unused household utensils and effects are also allowed to pass through the Customs free if tiiey undertake to re-export or pay duty on articles imp or ued new within a fixed time. By the new Customs la.v of December 25th, 1002 which has not yet come into force, the regulations respecting the free passage of removal effects through the Customs will in themselves undergo no material alteration; but the new law will render it possible to refuse free passage to the re moval effects of those foreigners whose country of origin does not grant reciprocity to Germans. The corresponding regulations of the new lav; run as fol lows : - 55. The following articles enter free of duty:- 1 2 3. Used articles of clothing and linen which are not imported for purposes of sale or industry. 4. Used articles for the personal use of set tlerssetulers, used machinery for emplo^mien't in industry or agriculture,but only in exceptional circumstances and with special permission »Vith the consent of the Bundesrat the Imperial Chancellor can decree that the advantages provided for in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply to sub- jecus of a State that does not grant reciprocity. granting Do printed regulations exist in Prussia foreign Consuls de Carriere special right in regard to the free entry of removal effects? In.reply to II. No General regulations or s any other law granting foreign Consuls de carriere once for all special privileges in regard to their removal effects exist in Prussia. The twofold privilege mentioned under I is granted for foreign Consuls de carriere in Prussia through the adminis trative autnorities and as each case arises, but it is true on principle, as may be seen from the Prus sian Minister of Finance's letter of February 14th, 1894 printed in the Appelt-Behrend commentary on the German Customs Tariff, 4 edition, 1397 P.9, Ki NoteHi-, //here may details be found as to what con- stitutes 'removal effects of private persons'? Do t printed regulations on the subject exist? In reply to III. From the Tariff lav/ itself it must be gathered v/hat is understood by 'removal ef fects' . They include: used household utensils and effects, used manufacturing implements and tools i.e., as the new Tariff Law puts it generally, 'all used ar ticles destined for the personal use of settlers.' (Compare the remarks made above in.reply to I). Printed regulations mentioning the objects included under the head, do not exist; the official list an nexed to the Customs Tariff requests, under 'removal effects', reference to the wording of the law. Some guidance is given in the declaration of the Prussian Minister of Finance of October 26th, 1895 printed in the Appelt-Behrend comnentary P.11, Note 27. Accord ing to this by 'effects' are to be understood in the main all movable articles, and as a rule at most a few groups of things (e.g. as 'removal e ff e ct s'. cattle) cannot be reckonedBERLIN. May 20th, 1904. Dear Maycock:- Sc sorry not to have answered your letter hefoie about rights of foreign consuls in Germany as regards duty free entrance of their household furni ture. I could find no special rules or regulations on the subject respecting Foreign Consular Officers de ^arriere'. But a short time ago I met dining out the man in the German Foreign Office here who superintends Consular Department. I asked him and he said he believed all the personal effects (pre sumably including used household furniture) of a Foreign Consular Official were admitted free in practice.practice, Uit was not sure if there was any special 'Order' on the subject. I thought this information not quite definite enough and wrote subsequently to ask him if he could tell me where I could find any actual Regulation on the point and if, in practice, a Foreign Consul would, on arrival in Germany, enjoy on entry any privileges greater than those accorded to any foreigner coming to settle in the country under §5,No. 2, of the Customs Tariff Law of July 15th 1879 (in the May 24th 1885 amended Edition). To this letter I have received no answer. I fancy they do not want to say definitely. Die No. 2 of §5 above referred to, says; (as admitted duty free). 2 . 'Clothing and linen, used, if not meant'for sole; used household utensils and effects 'of persons coming to reside and intended for their 'personal use; also with special permission^ new 'clothes, linen, and effects, being the outfits of 'foreigners settling in Germany for the purpose of 'marriage. ' My man in Foreign Office said that dutiable articles, such as groceries, wines &amp;c. , would be charged. I do not believe Consuls have any special Privileges.
