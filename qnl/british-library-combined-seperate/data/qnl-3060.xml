The reasons alleged for placing the individuals on an employment 'black list' were (a) because they had resigned because they could not obtain a salary increase above that paid by other companies in Bahrain; (b) because the person had resigned - no other reason given; (c) because they taken part in a strike of sweepers and cartmen; (d) because they had left their jobs at the Naval Base, Bahrain, without notice. The names of the individuals were then distributed to officials of various businesses, members of the military, and the Jewish Community.The closing date in the overall date range of this file, which is later than the date of the final piece of correspondence (11 August 1945), is produced by an entry in the notes at the rear of the file. There is a further set of notes dated 21 September 1948 (f. 10), which appears to have been misfiled.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Blacklisting, labour</topic></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Bahrain Political Agency, Menial Establishment</namePart></name></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0001e4#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0001e4#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0001e4#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
