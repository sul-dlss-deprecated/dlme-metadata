It is clear, however, that what the Air Ministry now requires goes considerably beyond the limited facilities obtained at Haor Q,uwai and it is for consideration whether His Majesty’s Government are to allow themselves to be handicapped in this matter by the existence of the Declaration of 1862. As you will see from their telegrams the Government of India and the Political Resident are agreed in the view that we should ignore this difficu-ty. They point out that the French no longer have any interests in Muscat and in any case they are hardly now in a position to raise object ions. Ihey would moreover question the correctness of the view that the sale of Masirah Island would compromise the guarantee of Muscat’s independence. We should be inclined to share their view that in the changed circumstances we can afford to ignore ary possible difficulties from the French. If we did have to justify our sieves to the 'French, wh5.ch would seem unlikely, v/e might well do so on the ground that the acquisition of a base on Masirah Island, over which we enjoy full control, was a measure essential to the successful prosecution of the war. This, however, is an aspect of the question on which the Foreign office will no doubt have views. 6. Assuming that this difficulty can be surmounted, the Government of India suggest that negotiations should be started with the Sultan with the following objectives in order of prefer-ence *- (a) An exchange of M&amp;sirah Island for the Kdria Muria Islands, accompanied by a cash compensation. Such an exchange might be useful to save the face of the Shaikh, and might possibly be a good point if objections were raised on the score of the 1862 Declarati on. (b) Straightforward purchase. As regards price, Sir G.prior has tentatively suggested £ 75,000 as a probable minimum. (c) A lease, which would presumably be for a term of 99 years. 7 # It i s suggested that Titiichever of these alternatives is finally agreed upon, the control of the local inhabitants should be exercised through the existing channels, i.e. British political authorities. In the case of a lease, however, it is unlikely that the Sultan, who is jealous of his position, would agree to surrender jurisdiction over his subjects. This is perhaps an argu ment for preferring purchase of the Island to a lease* 8. There are a number of points arising from this proposal that will require further examination, and we would suggest that as a first step it would be convenient if the matter could be considered at an interdepartmental meeting. If you and the Foreign Office agree, we will proceed to nake arrangements accordingly. 9 # x am sending a copy of this letter to Baxter at the Foreign Office, Mossop at the Admiralty, Dewhurst at the War Office, Trend at the Treasury and Sabben-dare at the Colonial office.

M Sultan of Muscat at an interview yesterday evening considered it considerable annoyance that A.I.O.C. had taken up Oil concessions because firstly he considered terms of agreement compare badly with those in Iraq copy of which he has, secondly he is not convinced company intend to prospect seriously. I said 1932 Iraq concession was made as far as I know with certain knowledge of presence of oil which was not the case here but he still considers he has made bad bargain and avowedly blames his own ignorance. Privately he probably feels he was persuaded into accepting what he is convinced are not favourable terms.”. 3. I believe royalty rate is same as in Bahrain.

X d™.ibt whether he will ever negotiate again an air agreement similar to tne tfoscet Civil Air Agreement of 1934-1338 mad which g&amp;ve us exclusive air rights. *111 he not, then, expect to be able to conclude 'nore than one civil air concession 7 Be expects to be asked by P.A.A. or other American Civil air lines for concessions. They will pay well. He probably knows that Sharjah gets 1.32,000 per annum. B.O.A.C. Customs receipts for the last two years have been only %. 3,000 per annua but' for soma time they have paid no duty on aviation or v.T. spirit having , drawn thair requirements from the h.A.F. They tfeve, also, by consigning their equipment to the K.A*F«, avoided payment on articles on which in peace tine they would have to pay. 1 think His nignneaf; mould, therefore, reasonably expect his customs receipts from one civil airways company to amount to &amp;• 10,000 par month. The Sultan could then expect to receive almost 4s. 60,000 per annum from one civil air concession. 6.

Poat *ar Civil Aviation. (a) Whatever course we adopt, Sultan is unlikely to a^ree to any proposal designed to deny the use of the landing ground, which will be within the base area presumably, to post-war civil air lines. (b) I do not think that he would accept compensation in lieu because he sets great store on the development of this route at the end of the war. He must realise that if we are not prepared to allow civil air lines to use .4asirah, tho development of this route will be seriously affected as Salalah is NOT a suitable alternative and, as far as I know, there is no other site on the island at aiasirah which could be developed. (c) Sultan must be expected, therefore, to ask whether he will be at liberty to grant civil air concessions and what restrictions we would impose. (d) Unless we can satisfy him on this point, I think the negotiations will be unsuccessful. If however, we can, the following points require consideration. 3. Purchase or exchange. (a) Sultan will not like the idea of any permanent alienation of his territory for reasons of public opinion. (b) Sultan would never agree to any reduction in tne royalties payable by P.C.L. under article 6 of their agreement betause he already thinks they are not generous enough. (c) Sultan will be unlikely to agree to sell or exchnage Masirah island, larger than Bahrain, which has never had a proper geological survey and which, for ail he knows, might one day prove to contain mineral and/or oil deposits of commercial value.0 Colonel Miles on page 488 of Vol. II of his book states that there are several worked out lead and copper mines on the island which were excavated in ancient times f Sultan is probably aware of this. (cQJuriediction. Sultan would be unlikely to agree to state subjects being tried by ua (Political Officer in MasiraftS on his very doorstep, and might ask that his subjects be sent to Muscat for trial. We should then find ourselves in the position of prosecuting State subjects in the Muscat courts which of course we could not accept. (e) protection . We would be responsible for the defence of our own territory but, sooner or later, there would inevi tably be some incident between State subjects (e.g. Jannabeh tribe wno normally inhabit the southern portion of the island and the mainland opposite) and ourselves. The case would then become one between the two Govts, and it is precisely this situation which we have consistently tried to avoid settling such incidents in the past (e.g. bevy incident a in Gwadur). (a) I can see no reason why Sultan should object to this course providing post-war civil air linos are not affected. He will probably like to compare the termi wa offer with those elsewhere (o.g. Sanrain Naval Base?)• it might therefore do as wail to be prepared to quoti them as a comparison in ordor to save time. (b) Surface Rights . Article 1(b) of ?.C.I/s concession reads as follows* •'There is nothing in this agreement which shall be read as restricting in any way the right of the Sultan to grant to others a lease over the-1 ©&gt; sarface righto of an area to be used for the purpose of construction of an aerodrome'* Article 16(a) of the same concession reads as follows* 'The Company shall have free of cost the unrestricted use of surface rights over all the uncultivated lands of the leased area which the company may need*... and the company may buy or leaseany lands houses or buildings with the consent of and on the conditions to be arranged with the proprietors'. This point could probably be settled by H.M.G. informing P.C.L. that they had been granted a lease with exclusive surface rights over the specified area, (c Ju risdiction . As at present. If civil air lines station personnel there, unless they arc British or Muscat subjects, they are liable to trial in tha Muscat courts. This point has not arisen during war time as they are all under service discipline. Sultan should in any case have responsible person stationed in Masirah. (d) Protection . State as ’owner' of the island would remain responsible for protection against tribes. Incidents would be dealt with as at present i.e. without becoming cases of one Govt, against the other. hjs.BQf&amp;l. af ..g.c.A. gton 3 huildings .vnich revert, to dtate at end of &lt;ar. Sultan has often mentioned that he expects to sell them back to any bidder at tna end of the war. Summary. (a) ii we design to deny tne use of Masirau island to non- British post-war civil air lines, I think the Sultan is unlikely to agree to our proposals. (b) Arc we therefore prepared to allow civil air linos to use the landing ground and with what rectrictiions, if stationing non-British ground staff,evacuation in case of emergency etc*) (c) Aill Sultan be free to grant air concessions or alternatively charge landing fees ? (d) How do our tei'ms compara with those elsewhere e.g. Bahrain ? (e) lt would appear that negotiations for a lease arc more likely to be successful anu, if for a long JLia* term, should suit us equally well. Sultan is bound 'never to cede, to soli or to mortgage or any portion of hia territory save to the British Govt, (vide Agreement of 20th March 1391... page 317 Vol XI Aitchison^ Treaties). If Lease, therefore, were for portion of island only, there would be no question of remaining pfilpJtion (which in any case could probably be useless) being transferred other than to British Government.

Meanwhile (d) 27th 3ept. 1942 ; Jackson negotiated for further facilitiei for the Americans vide his No. J140 of that date, copy herewith. Paragraphs 1(a) and 21(b) refer.

No reply was received, (g) 22nd Marcn 1943 s Jacxson in hie D.O. No. J 210 forwarded correspondence to the Political Agent. I cannot trace from the correspondence Jackson's reasons for again asking for facilities to erect buildings as the Sultan had already agreed to this vide sub-paragraph (b) above. The stipulation in Jackson's J. 140 of the 27th Sept. 1942 which amended the original agreement for building facilities to which the U.S.A# Govt, had agreed, was never put to the latter and they have, therefore, never- accepted it. This was not made clear to the Sultan who, however, should have known that without tne J.S.A. Govt's acceptance, this clause amending the original clause could not be considered as binding. There seems no alternative but to tell him that the U.S.A Govt, have xiever accepted any amendment to the agreement to which he consented originally and that the buildings remain the property of the U.S.A# I. myself, have always been unaer the impression from Jackson’s J. 140 of 27th Japtember 1942 that all stone buildings reversed to the Jtate at the end of the fcar, but, now that the question has arisen and having seen the files here, that is obviously wrong. The Sultan would resent this rude awakening as he often talks about selling them back to prospective buyers at the end of the War and keeps a careful record of the sites of all such buildings.Copy of lettar No. J. 140 dated the 27th September 1942 from the Asolstant to h.S.M’s Consul, Muscat to His Highness Saiyid Said bin Taimur, Sultan of Muscat and Oman.

(d) Permission to sink wells at Masirah ana Saialah. 2. ) To the above was later adaed a request for permiss ion to import skilled labour from outside to work at Maeirah and Has al Hadd if military artisan companies could not be obtained. 3. I understanc that your Highness agreed to grant these facilities but after discussion of ny D.O* letter No* J.120 of the 20th September, made the following stipulations;- (a) The new buildings at Salalun should extend westwards from the present camp and not northwards towards the hills or south wards to Saialah town.

Cofran, U.3.Army Engineer Corps. Asmara. Continuation of my telegram No. 125 of 21st September,. Facilities requested from Sultan on your behalf were:- (a) Permission to erect buildings for maintenance men and air cre^/vs in transit at Catalan, Masirah and Has al Hadd; aua the accommodation to be for 100 men each at Salalah and Masirah and for 60 at has al iiadd. (b&gt; Permission mo employ military artisan Coys, at Has al Hand and Masirah. (c) Permission to bring 100 masons and 100 carpenters from Aden to work at Masirah. (d) Permissi.on to sink wells at Masirah and Salalah and (c) Permission uo bring masons and carpenters from outside Sultan's territories to work at Has ai Hadd and Masirah if military artisan companies not obtainable. 3. Sultan has agreed to grant tnose facilities bit has made following stipulations;- (a) New buildings at Salalah should extend westward from the present camp and not northwards towards tne nilis or southwards towards Salalah town. Sultan would iixe to see plans of ouildings and a map showing tne site on which you propose to erect them before you actually erect them; (b) All stone buildings snouid be left intact to the Muscat State afLer tne war f (c) As a qualification lo permission to import artisans from outside Sultan lakes it that available local artisans will be employed as well. (d) Sultan has no objection to your sinxing a well at Saialah on the understanding tnat tne water is re uired to supply a fire fighting installation for use in case water cannot be supplied from his channel but the water from it should not be used for ordinary domestic or irrigation purposes as long as water is available from Sultan's channel. (e) American personnel will accept and abide by all the local rules as they are or may oe made for their behaviour particularly those regarding tne posting of guards for your camp and persons. Guards for your camp ana personnel, supplied by the Sultan, will be acceptea and paia for. The number of guards is to oe determined from the size of the camp and requirements fa of the personnel as in the case of the Royal Air Force. A copy of the rules at present applicable to the Royal Air Force is attached for your information. (f) Unloading of ships; The landing of stores from ships is usually done by local boatmen. It is their livelihood but Sultan has no objection to U.S. iirrny landing such stores as local boatmen cannop handle. (g) Rice ana fresh local produce are available in Saiaiah for labour imported from outside. You should bring all other rations for them.(h) Payments for supplies and services in dhofar should be made fortnightly in Marea Theresa dollars. Sultan reserves right to refuse any M.T. dollars dhich he may consider aefactive• Payments to coolies in Masirah and Has al Haad may be made in rupees. 4. stipulation (e) in paragraph 3 above, which also applies to the R.A.F. is one of the stipulations Sultan has made to Consul at Muscat during negotiat ons, which incidentally, are not yet complete, for permission for U.S. nrmy Air Forces to use Salalah. It is therefore presumably receiving attention of American authorities concerned with negotiations. Sultan regards it as an essential condition and is unlikely to alter it unless approached as part of the major negotiations. The remaining stipulations are, however, open to discussion independentally of the raa 0 or negotiations. If there is any stipulations which you consider unworkable or likely to Impede your operations, I suggest you let me know what the difficulties arc likely to be so that I can again discuss thara with Sultan before you accept his stipulations. 5. Unfortunately this is likely to cause some delay as Sultan is leaving for holiday in India on 8th October and not returning until the first week in November. 6. Have heard from Consuu at Muscat tuiat 100 coolies each for Has al Hadd and Masirah can be sent with rations from Muscat. The small launch at Has al Hadd to which you referred is tne property of Royal Air Force. Have no doubt H./w.F. will lend it to you. | Consul can arrange lighters at Has al Hadd for you.

Two messages this subject sent by me from Salalah first in G.T.C. of which only Muscat telegram C/1075 30th June contained extract second in private code not repeated to you. Am doubtful therefore that cyphers have been compromised. 3. Private code has been used last 2-^ years between Muscat and Salalah and though admittedly a simple code (already decided that A.P.A. on return will take civil cypher system) this is first suggestion of any compromise.- 2 - © / 5. Regarding the extent it has been used, 26 messages have been sent and-receive since 15th June 1944 in this code. 6. I should like to add one or two comments. I do not see how the cyphers can have been compromisac because no single message of yours from Muscat is an ex&amp;ct^ 4 ' repetition of any message of mine in the Private Code. Your C/1075 of 30th June could hardly be connected with my P.162 of 20th June 1944. 7. Regarding compromising of the negotiations, only one of my messages (No. P 173 of 25th June) was sent in Private Code. The only other message on this subject which I sent was my No. £ 162 of 20th June which was in G.T.C. and wnich I used because it is slightly safer than the Private Code. If it is held that the negotiations have been compromised through my use of G.T.C. once and the Private Code once, it should be remembered that the A.P.A. has had no other means of communication for the last three years, and every single subject mentioned in either of these two codes during these three years can similarly be considered to have been compromised. I am not trying to stir up more mud, but I, for one, do not intend accepting the position of scapegoat for a system which, admittedly, was open to censure. 8.

Since it is now clear that Kuria Huria Islands were free gift, they can have no cash value for purposes of forthcoming negotiations and we agree with prior that they should be kept in background for use as face saver if Sultan desires one. 3. We feel that discussion on oil royalties is certain to complicate negotiations and advise therefore that Resident should not volunteer reservation of these royalties to Sultan. If Sultan himself raises question and successful negotiation is found to han^l on this istue, it may be necessary to agree to reservation. in that case we have considered whether grant of concession should be marked by any reduction in consideration to be paid whether in pur chase price or lease money, but have con- eluded that any such attempt would Involve Impossible assessments and further complicate negotiations. v *e would, therefore agree that, should it be necessary to reserve royalties to Sultan, reservation should be outside purchase or lease money altogether. liar chase .

If we are forced to accept lease, we note that under Article 16 of current Treaty, employees of His Majesty's Government not in direct service of Political Agent would be subject to Sultan's Court unless he cedes jurisdiction. In any case we feel strongly that lease terms must include complete surrender of criminal, civil and revenue jurisdiction much as in oass of Kalat leases in Baluchistan. If negotiations result only in lease and oil royalties art left to Sultan, we suggest incorporation that no operations may take place on any site which would Interfere with Hdi.G.’s military or other installations. It should also be left in no doubt that Sultan would retain no rights of odfeiidstration of minerals or oil. 6. Terms of Kuria Hurla Deed might well be shown to Sultan as suggesting generosity but it will be important to avoid archaisms or language lending colour to suggsetlon that as^essmsnt is result of compulsion. 7.

I have discussed question with Hickinbotham and showed him recent despatches from Bird. So far as we can see there is no political advantage whatever in pur chasing Masirah (except as a bargaining counter in civil aviation) in fact there is drawback that we should acquire some responsibility for bedouin. 2. It is now clear that Sultan is fully alive to value of Masirah for civil aviation in fact he is already looking forward to selling back their own buildings to Americans l I do not think in circumstances that he will be likely to agree to Rs. 50,000 and we should be prepared to pay considerably more for lease. Pan American Airways will no doubt be prepared to pay substantial premium in addition to annual rental. 3. We discussed question of capital payment and do not recommend that opening bid of 15 lakhs be increased at present aw it is not possible to forecast Sultan 1 s reactions. On the one hand Muscat has had wave of prosperity and is in unusual position of having substantial surplus. On the other hand there is indication that favourable time is drawing to a close and administrative costs are rising. There is also important factor that Sultan is known to be acquiring nest egg with object of making himself independent of State and capital payment would facilitate this. 4. If ofcourse it could be held that words M or otherwise give for occupation 1 * in treaty of 20 March 1891 exclude all foreign concessions then position would be greatly simplified, but I doubt whether they could bear this interpretation.

I qnclose a copy of a note by cur Legal Adviser* It seems to' us. that t’ ere are really two separate points to be considered; (1) the uynent of oil royalties, and the position of the Oil 'Company in the.- event of our chase of t he Island. (2) the necessity of securing that any oil c Derations on the Island would, not interfere with tie R.a.F.’s requirements there. (it is perhaps relevant to observe in the latter connection that hasIrah Island covers an area of some 250 square dies am con tains some hilly country so that clearly the aerodrome facilities required w ill not ecc* py the w hole of it). 3. regards the first point, the “leased'area' of Petroleum Concession Ltd’s concession is defined in Article 1 (a) of their agreement 'with ti e bultan d ated 24th June 1937 as 'The Sultanate of ■ uscat and Oman including all islands and territorial waters appertainin. thereto (except Gwadur)'. -It is clear, therefore, that Masirah ISl . : € uhe 'leased area' ranted to.the Co ipany by the Suite, , and in our vie,, t] e sale by the Sultan to .us of the Island woulc not affect the Concession, and the Company /ould. still e entitle^' to exercise their rights ti.ereunder. assuming that it is decided to leave i necessary is to indude a statement to that effect in the agreement relating to the sale.

LI A IRAK Island is situated off the £e coatet of ARABIA in latitude 20°50' longditude 58°45' , and is separated from the mainland by a narrow, shallow channel some 44 miles in width and of a maximum depth of 50feet. T OPOGRAPHY . The horthern peninsula, where the aerodrome is situated is comparatively flat and low lying as also are parts of the western seaboard, but the topography of the Island is typically rough and irregular/the principal feature beihg a dissected range of hills running N-S along the length of the Island with the easterly an3 westerly drainages separated by a central watershed. The hills rise t6 a maximum height of 750 feet; but are more precipitious on the eastern side where occasionally, as at Has ZAPAMAT, the hills rise directly from the ^ - sea. As a result the eastern drainages have a consider- a,ble steeper gradient than the westerly ones. RAINFALL . No statistics are available. Naval Intelligence reports stats the rainfall to be scanty, but that occasional* haavy downpours occur. It is reported to have rained once during the last year at the aerodrome. Wadis and drainage systems exist, and it would appear there definitely is a certain amount of precipitation in the hills. Signs water erosion of roads was observed. GEOLOGY . (i)The igneous rocks. LI AS I RAH Island is formed essentially of basic igneous rocks belonging to the SSRMAIL SERIES which occur prin cipally in the mountains of OMAN. This igneous complex a - o seen at MASIRAH consists mainly of diabase and serpen tine - no dykes were observed. The rock type is similar to the GREENSTONE of NW SYRIA and the serpentine of the TROODOS^Kills of CYPRUS. The formation is typically well .jointed and the uoper zones are off ten highly de composed. ^ ContdGrflDLQGY . (ii) Eocene Limestone. As well as capping the two highest hills on the Island, Eocene Limestones occur in three or four instances as small isplated outliers. In all cases the contact of the Eocene and the underlying igneous rocks was above sea-level and the limestones were disposed subhorizontally. (iii) Recent (Pleistocene) Sandstones. In certain restricted localities along the coastal 'belts recent lightly consolidated sandstone occur, either lying directly on the irregular surface of the 'basic igneous rocks or resting uncomfortably on Eocene Limestone. (iv) Structure. THE main land of ARABIA opposite the Island of MASIJ&amp;K is flat, lowlying desert area formed'of eocone Lime stone. The presence df the igneous rock forming the Island is due to major faulting associated with the . complex mountain filds of the arc of OMAN. HYP. OhQC-&lt;Y . (3i) Source of available underground water. Underground water is derived from rainfall; if not at or near the locality of the water supply itself, then derived from a high rainfall area some distance away and reaching the supply by means of percolation along porous strata The underground supplies of the other Arabian Stations such as ADEN, SAL^ALAH or ShABJAH are brought about in this manner, the water being derived from rain falling on the interior mountain ranges of YSLEN, the HADHRAMAUT and Oim respectively. In the case of MASIRAH however, ho such source of underground water exists, except the mountains of 01IAIT which are at an excessive distance nor is the strata favourable to the movement of large supplies of under ground water. The basic igneous rock being consi derably decomposed in its upper layers probably absorbs sea water and t-his is liable to percolate a certain distance Inland. The only source of fresh water in MASIRAli is local rainfall and it should therefore be expected that the best water supplies should be located in tte largest cat&amp;hmentfc areas, that the best quality water will be au uhe top o.l local water tables and that heavy DUirTpinv will result in a deterioration of quality. A water supply reconnaissance of the Northern half of the Island was carried out and substantiated the above suppositions. Details concerning the depths, yields (where possible) and quality of the fifteen supplies examined are tabulated in Table A. (ii) (a) Underground water in the igneous formations. All supplies derived from the decomposed up'ier layers of the disbase are highly mineralised. Threesuch supplies exist namely the 'Ablution Water Well', the American tfbrehole and the brak water welisfewn on te sketch map. As would be exoected the quality of water from the Ablution well deteriorates with heaw pumping and it should be noted that the American bore hole which has the deepest penetration into the di&amp;base yeilds by far the worst eater, both salinity and hard ness being very high.3 The poor quality of* these two supplies results from poor catchment areas and unfortunately this applies to the whole of the northern penisula area where the aerodrome is si'taaated* (b) Supply ho.4 appears to be derived from recently lightly consolidated sandstone. There is a fair inland drainage area from the direction of Hound hill; the well is about' 1/4 mile from the sea. Some 600 gallons are at present taken out daily and sold by the local arabs to the coolie camp. The supply might be increased by trenching and thereby exposing a greater area of the water tabifee. Any develop^nient should not be taken more than 2 1 below standing water level) or the quality would certainly deteriorate- Over pumping will also have the same-flarmful result. (c) The main aquifer for potable water supplies on tr Island are the wadi gravels and local Arabs have attempted to ftain obtain supplies in nearly all the wadis. The best supplies both as regards yield and quality occur* where advantage is taken of the bigger catchment areas. The best supply on the west coast of the Island, along which the road runs is at the village of fur kasidi, south of UmftjRas^gas. Here there are four or five native wells supulying the small village and the RAF camp at dm*Rastas was drawing washing water by lorry about twice a weekj^ln order to draw thiis water more quickly they were proposing to deeoen the well. The wells are situated in a comparatively broad wadi and are fed by quite a large catchment area; they are about half a mile from the sea. It seems probable that either trenching or the construction of a series of four inter-comiaunioated 12' diara concrete lined wells should produce a yield of 10,000 gallons per day pumping at the rate of not more than 1000 gallons per hour. V/ater boring machines are not necessary for the developement of the supply. The quality, as shown in Table A, is fair being quite potable and even leaving allowance for considerable deterioration. These wells should not be deepened more than about 4 ! below standing water level or deterioration in quality will result; increased yields should be obtained by enlarging the area of exposed water table. Well No.12 in wadi Hakkan is well situated and has the advantage of a large catchment area. It is quite probable that prooerly constructed wells could develop a supply from the gravels in this area. Standing water level being only 14 T open dug wells are the best mode of developement. The local! is inaccessible and at present can only be reached by jeep. This applies even more so to supply No.12 at Hakkan village where the quality of water is particularly good. Development here as outlined above for Bur Masidi would probably result in a yield of 10000 gallons per day. v Supply No.13 is from a spring located as indicated on the sketch map. The flow was measured to be 4,725 gallons per 24 hrs. The water tffckles out at the contact of the igneous rock and a local outlier of Eocene Limestone. One Arab lives here and irrigates a small garden. As can be seen from Analysis on Table A the mineral content of the water though high, a low enough for it to be quite potable. (Contd- 4 - © /t&gt;f r 1 O GEOPHYSICS, (i) Measurements in the i^nous rook. ' 1 a number of electrical derth probe measurements were made in the aerodrome area and in the vicinity of the brak well. In all cases values suggestive of high salinity water were obtained. Maximum de r &gt;th of decomposed and weathered upper layers if igneous formation observed was 200 ; maximum depth to which measure ents were made was 300 f . Below the '200 feet figure mentioned above it is likely that solid unaltered and non water bearing diabase would be encountered. (ii) The only locality in the gravels wte where measurements were made prior to my depar ure was at site Ho.3. Here it would appear that the depth of gravels is at the nuii 20 feet and the values again were sg:estive of high salinity. The geophysical programme continued for a few days after the departure of the Measuring depth of sand stones at site &amp; add also depth s and extent of wadi gravels at Sur Lasidi. RECOMMENDAT IONS . IT) Deep# bores. Deep bores in the aerodrome area , and any where in the Island will be through diabase, the upper 200 f of which may be decomposed and contain water, but it is almost certain to be saline. Deep boring cannot therefore be recomended as having much change of success, particularly in tre aerodrome aea inhere there are no favourable catchment#/ areas. (ii) Shalbvvwell develop ent . (a) Additional wells in the vicinity of th© present ablution water well as at present proposed would assist in giving slightly better quality water as the present well is heavily pumped. It is unlikely Hat good water will be obtained in the vicinity. (b) With the object of attempting to develop 10,000 gtls. per day the most favourable localities, in order of merit, are at Wells Nos.12,12,11,4 ad possibly 6 , it is doubtful whether there are sufficient quantities of water rt site No.3. Unfortunately no proper yeild tests have so far been possible. Sppyly No»4 . This being much the nearest would be worth trying first. Trenching alon; the wteter table in an easterly and southerly direction from the existing well might considerably increase the y±Tct yield at this well- Depth should not exceed more than 2M below water table level or the quality will certainly deteriorate and the rate of pumping shcuid be kept as low as possible. Supply No.10. Development of tie supply, either by trench- ing on the I/estern Desert aqueduct system or by the construction of four 12 f diam concrete lined inter-communi cating wells, is likely to give the required yield of 10,000 galls per day. / Survey of the extent and depth of the gravels in the Wadi is still proceeding, and information as to the best location, will be forwarded later. Trial wells and controlle test pumping would.be require! yishstxQfxdSjcQ&amp;Q gBXXSJxpKKxaay. before embarking on any water supply scheme. The pipeline from here to the aerodrome would be $1*miles in length; the aerodrome is 50 f above USE. Supplies No_. II and 12 At present ruled out owing toInaccojsi'bility although properly constructed wells would probably be su® essful. In the good weather season water could be tahen * by bozfc . (iii) D evelopment of the spring . The flow of the spring was measured to be 4725 galls, n.d. The work cleaning out and controlling the flow may slightly increase^ the yield. It is advisable however to attempt to obtain a much larger yield as although this might be achieved there vrould be definite danger of exhausting the supply. It is about roughly mile from the sea and 50 r above MSL. The water from this spring could be brought to the aero drome area by any one of the following methods (a) R±j5Kx£±RHXBXHRgxfc&amp;®XEXsfcxKHasfcxiK3aHHix2XxDri:£BBi Water to flow by gravity to storage tank arranged to deliver into dhow or lighter and thence by sea transport to the aerodrome. There is a good anchorage for small boats. (b) Pipe line along the east cost (about 17 miles) (c) Pipe line over low hills between the spring and site No .3 with a storage tank on a hill o~ suitable height for gravity feed to aerodrome. (15 Mil®s over rough country) (d) Pipe line cross backbone of island to $&gt;in He western coast road and thence to aerodrome. i This would all involve considerable labour pumps and the necessary storage tank. It should also be borne in mind that the locality is very inaccessible except by sea. CONCLUSI ON. It if were essential MASIRAK could be made self Isufficient as regards water. For assured supply a small diam pipeline 21 miles long would be required fed from wells at fur Masedi$&gt; with possible additional intakes en route for newly constructed wells at Supplies No.l, 4 and even 3 . This supply could be agumented by water itither shipped in from the springs at site 13 or they could join the main pipe line by means of a site pipe across the Island. From the Hygiene point of view any new wells could be kept clean and uncontaminated and should be quite satisfactory. This scheme probably involves more labour equipment add material than is warranted for tte size of the station. The alternative is for drinking water to be secured by osration of the two distillation plants newly arrived on the Island find for an improvement of the ablution water supply to be made by developing local wells as fa£ as local resources of labour allow.4 oaj a AOSS *2 &gt; , Telegram From To Repeated No. T/45I Dated 4th 8V71 Q Political Resident, at Shiraz.

In our view nothing would be gained by puchasing or even leasing the whole island if flying rights on air field and anchorage could be obtained as at Bahrain, Sharjah and Dubai and we consider that attempt should first be made to secure these. 3. For purpose of negotiations it is necessary that meaning of passage M or otherwise give for occupation ,, in 1891 treaty should be clarified. Given the whole tenor of phraseo logy employed and context of this particular passage it is surely a reasonable interpretation of intention of contracting parties and of force of agreement with itself to hold that alienation in any form whatever of any part of Sultan*s territories would bs permitted in favour of His Majesty*s Government alone. If so, more particularly if considerations were paid solution of 'occupation** would include user. This seems to have been meaning assigned to words by His Majesty*s Government in 1899 vis-a-vis the Frencji. On this interpretion not only would Sultan be deprived of Pan-American competitive bargaining counter but acquisition of island ( as distinct from flying rights) by puchase or lease would become unnecessary and it should be possible to secure flying rights for reasonable figure. No doubt law officers will be consulted if necessary. 4. We note Prior*s reference to re-sale to Americans of 'their buildings'. Southern route was developed from India and we do not seem to have been told that Americans had been permitted to build. We are enquiring into this but even if it transpires that they were allowed to build this might be regarded as emergency war time concession to ally not affecting special position granted permanently to His Majesty*s Government under 1391 Treaty.

Will you please refer to my secret letter 78120/1/44 of the 26th June regarding the proposed purchase or lease of Masirah island. The Governor of Aden, Sir John Hall, is now in England and he has been consulted about these proposals. We have also had a reply from the Acting Governor at Aden on this subject As a result 6f these consultations our Secretary of State's view is that he would have no objection to the retrocession of the Kuria Muria islands to the Sultan of Muscat. As regards the future administration of Masirah, if acquired Sir John Hall would have no objection to undertaking it from Aden if he were asked to do so, and if he had the necessary dtaff, but equally he sees no objection to the island being attached to the charge of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, as suggested in your letter of the 21st. June although he thinks it possible that the Air Officer Commanding at Aden might prefer that it should be controlled from Aden. We agree with the Governor's views and would have no objection to Masirah Island being attached to the charge of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf for administration through the Political Agent at Muscat.

Dear Peel, Your letter Ext. 2807/44 of the 4th July regarding the Kuria Muria Islands. After consulting our Legal .advisers we consider that Parliament must be consulted before the islands are ceded to the Sultan of Muscat% but that an Actc of Parliament would only be necessary if ( I) the cession* of these islands was of such a character that it was desired to mark the occasion by some kind of special formality, or ( 2 ) if there were ancillary .or consequent ial matters arising out of the cession which actually require legislation. There seem to be no grounds for (I) in the present case and you will know best whether ( 2 ) is pertinent. 2. On an analogy with a recent case ( the cession of the -i-sle of Patos to Venezuela ) it seems necessary that the question be referred to the Attorney-General. We shall be prepared to do this hearing from you about ( 2 ) above. 3. The form of the agreement is not affected by the question of reference to Parliament. Provided the agreement is made subject to ratification, as it should be in any case, it is not necessary to make any reference to Parliamentary approval in the agreement itself.

PERSONAL AND SECRET INDIA OFFICE, WHITEHALL, LONDON, S.W.1. ^^November 1 944. Dear Prior, You will no doubt be wishing to know her,7 things have progressed with regard to Masirah Island. The matter has unfortunately been considerably held up here in the first place as the result of certain objections put forward by the Treasury, particularly to a lump sum payment in the case of outright purchase, in view of the considerable financial difficulties ./ith which H.M.G. are confronted as the result of the large sterling balances now held by Middle Eastern countries. The Foreign Office and (in particular) the Colonial Office have also been somewhat exercised by the effect which outright purchase might have on the Americans, the Colonial Office having in mind the question of the West Indies bases which certain prominent Americans have been suggesting should be purchased outright by the U.S. Government. The Colonial Office also found recently that they had objection to the retrocession of the Nuria Murias on the grounds that to give them up with the few inhabitants they may possess might prove an awkward precedent in other more important spheres. We have ourselves considered these objections to be somewhat exaggerated, and have continued to urge the advantage of purchase over lease or the ground that the former would much simplify such problems as jurisdiction and control over the inhabitants of Masirah. We have, however, not felt able to press this very far in view of the preference of the other interested departments for lease, since of course the proposal is primarily an Air Ministry one and H. M. G. are to pay. We have however suggested for consideration the possibility of the insertion in the lease contract of an option to. purchase at a later date. The position nor/ - is that it is expected that a paper will go forward before long to the Cabinet (l hope within the next three weeks or so) proposing lease rather than purchase, but at the same time allowing you discretion within limits agreed by t he Treasury to exceed the figure of half a lakh, if necessary, and also to vary the incidence as between annual payment and initial lump sun, so that if the Sultan prefers it, he may have a larger sum cash down and a smaller sum annually. The idea of using the Kuria Muria Islands as a bargaining counter is now probably to be ruled out, while the Sultan is to be offered definitely the retention of oil royalties on Masirah. You will of course be receiving instructions in due course by telegram, but when that will be I am ^afraid I-am still unable—to estimate witH any degree of accuracy. I am sending copies of this letter to Caroe, and also to Galloway, who, as you may know, saw our papers while he was on leave here, and attended an interdepartmental meeting on the subject.

I gathered that this was as much in connection with civil requirements as with the Air Force. introduction to the fact This serves as an 3. that it has occurred to me - and certainly to many other persons also - that the acquisition of permanent rights at Masirah will probably lead to the request for at least landing rights at Salalah, Shuwaimiyah and Has A1 Hadd. It is probable, at the present stage of aircraft development, that Masirah can only be satisfactorily operated in conjunction with the landing grounds mentioned above. If this does happen it will add considerably to the difficulties of negotiation, especially as regards Salalah.

Whitehall, S.W.l SECRET . / , i 16th October, 1945. l / My dear Chilver, \ - We have only just 'received from the Foreign Office a copy of Baxter's letter to you of 7th September about Masirah Island and should be glad to know how the position now stands so far as the Air Ministry is concerned, with regard to the draft Cabinet Paper. 2. We are ready at any time, on hearing from you, to submit it to our own Secretary of State, and should indeed like to emphasize the desirability of early action being taken to secure a decision from the Cabinet in the matter. ? , ^ 3. At present the lack of a decision is preventing us from making any approach to the Sultan in regarding the post-war aviation plans generally. You will remember in this connection that as long ago as March the Multan asked the Political Agent whether he had any information about British post-war aviation policy for the southern Arabian route, and in their express letter of 24th April the Government of India put forward their own requirements and suggested that the Political Resident should start negotiations with the Sultan. Sir Geoffrey Prior is anxious to start on these when he returns to the Gulf at the end of this month. 4. Moreover, the agreement under which we enjoy our present facilities at Masirah was strictly i speaking for the duration of the war only, and although the Sultan may be content to go on receiving a subsidy of £ 18,000 a year for the continuation of these facilities, the time is a; proaching when the matter will have to be cleared up. 5 .

Matter has been under further consideration here. Air Ministry are of opinion that it would now suffice for their purpose if they could secure same facilities at kasirah as they no?/ enjoy at Bahrain. In view of this and of possible wider repercussions which mlfht result from purchasing or loasihs wnole Island as Hoyal Air Force base it has been decided that it would be better to secure facilities if possible under arrangements similar to that at i^anrain. 3. Royal Air Force will wish to be able to operate from hasirah in an emergency. They will thus need facilities from time to time in connection with mobile exercises or the stationing at the island Ox • &lt;■ TS— reconnaissance ?aircraft in periods of eaergency. n assumption that air field will be fully equipped as a civilian staging post Air Ministry requirements would bo permanent storage for a United amount of hoavj aircraft equipment together with storage for petrol, oU and lubricants. Provision of mooring facilities for a maximum of six flying boats and refuexling fa cilities i.e. suitable refuelling craft would also be required. For mobile and general reconnaissance exercises in peace and deployment of genera- reconnai ssance forces in emergency special arrangements would be made to move in personnel and scares etc. by sea or air. There would be no necessity for permanent stationing of service personnel on island and it would suffice if air field facilities were normally operated and maintained by civilian personnel employed by civil air transport operator. his ajesty’s Government s require seats for civil air transport are not li^iy to be very considerable. Any indication of c-vLl air services planned or proposed by Government of India and extent to which Indian operating company wo j 1 propose to maintain air field would be of assistance. . 4. It would seen possible that these requirements could be supplied under cover of proposed new biVi.1 Air Agreement (see Governtaent of India Rxoress netter No. K.111(3)-PV»RA5 dated 24th April 1*U&gt;) to which an agreement (possibly In exchange o: letters with Sultan; ml^ht be appended covering Royal Air Aorce aili^ary requirements both at baslrah and elsewhere in t u sca ^ territory.

Important Following is repetition of India Office telegram No.3637 February 12th begins Air Ministry are anxious that facilities enjoyed by R.A.F. in Masirall Island should be placed on more regular and permanent basis than war-time arrangements secured by exchange of letters with Sultan completed in Nov/ember 1939. 2. At present one squadron of land planes is based . at Masirah and emergency IcOiding facilities for flying boats are available at Umm Rasas. These dispositions are of vital importance for anti U-boat and reconnaissance operations and Masirah is considered most satisfactory base available in area. As an island it has advantages as (two nuts.) against enemy attack and tribal disturbances. 3. Airfield here is also important as link in Southern Air Transport Route to India and its use is likely to increase during Japanese War when flow of aircraft may develop beyond capacity of nortnern route. In normal conditions northern route is more convenient and better situated strategic ally but southern route is essential reserve route for war- time. Southern route is likely to remain secondary to northern route for peace time civil air traffic and Air Ministry are anxious that matter shoulu be regarded as strategical requirement and should as far as possible be dissociated from question of post war civil aviation. 4. Air Ministry consider essentials of satisfactory arrangement are that it should hold good in peace time as well as in war that it should allow full discretion regarding development of island for military purposes and should give British authorities adequate power to control local inhabitants and exclude tribal disturbances. They suggest outright purchase would2 * vvould be advantageous if practicable but that failing this requirements’ coulu probably be met by grant under Treaty of an air base on terms similar to those enjoyed by R.a.F. in Egypt and Iraq. 5, Before matter is considered further by H.M.G. .r _ . - - - I should be glad to have your preliminary views and those of the Government of India and your suggestions as to how the Air Ministry’s requirements could best be met. You will no aoubt agree tliat for strategic reasons every assistance should be given towards securing desired facilities. My only comment at this stage is that it might be preferable to put matter to Sultan as business proposition for purchase or lease of island rather than as treaty provision as in case of Egypt and Iraq. You should not of course make any approach to Sultan at this stage. Ends. ' 2 . Please telegraph your views - Britconsul - /'V.* &lt; II-B/9 (D Telegram S From Political Agent, Maacat.

Present position is that we have f*acilities for duration of war and permission for our own military guards. Sultan has never raised objection either here or elsewhere against development for military purposes and it therefore seems only necessary to consider (a) continuance into peace time and (b) civil powers over local inhabitants. 2. Outright purchase would solve all problems but •it might prejudice Sultan's position with tribes if they learnt \ he had permanently alienated a piece of territory. This contingency would not be attached to a lease an' as regards (a) above, with precedent of Khor Kuwai, indefinite time period should present no difficulty. 3. Point (b) may prove difficult as Sultan dislikes existing extra territoriality. So far, I know of no difficulties from Masirah in tuis respect.

It has now Been agreed here between departments concerned that H.M.G.’s approval should^be sought for negotiations to be initiate ( omm. ) Sultan on the - lines proposed and that objectives should be placed in order suggested in paragraph No.6_ of Government of India telegram No. 2758 (lease would be on 99 years basis). It is considered that difficulty arising from 1862 agreement vis-a-vis French nay be ignored. Before matter is sub- itted for approval however it is desired to have your views and any comments by Government of India on points referred to in paragraph No. 2 and 3 below. 2. (a) Bearing in mind vital need for securing Nasirah Island for R.n.F's purposes do you regard Rs.10 lakhs as reasonable maximum figure up to which you should be authorised to negotiate with Sultan or would you advise higher price. (b) What effect In your view would offer of KURIA NURIA Islands in part exchange have on price for ITasirah Island ( see Government of India telegram No. 2758 para.4) (c) What would you estimate reasonable figure for lease on 99 years basis.? 3. It has been suggested that with permanent establishment of R.A.F. at Na sir all local population might well increase and in any case some administrative delegates in *part- ticular Police would be required. In case of purchase British law would presumably have to be applied to island which would become British territory and inhabitants of which would unless specific arrangements we e made to contrary become British subjects Regarding responsibility for administration there appears to be three possibilities (a) for island to be placed within jurisdiction of Political Resident who would presumably have to have special pov/ers given him (b) for island to be attached and administered from Aden colony ( though distance from Aden would make this inconvenient and arrangements might be unwelcome to Sultan) (c) for island to be technically attached to Aden but in fact administered by Political Resident and Political agent, Muscat as in case of NURIA MUR La. Islands where however no administrative problems arise. I should be glad to have your comments on above points and your view as to nature of administrative machinery required it was felt here that as number of inhabitants of Masirah is not likely to be large at any rate at outset it night suffice for the present if small police force under native inspector were stationed there, Political Agent paying visits as required. 4. With regard to urgently approaching Sultan,Air Ministry would ofcourse like negotiations to be completed as scon as possible. I am not however yet in position to give you final insturctions and it will probably be best to await Sultan's return from Middle Bast particularly since special journey there might place you in disadvantageous position vis-a-vis Sultan and risk of negotiations becoming generally known would be increased.

You will have seen from my tel. 1031 of April 29th. that Felly thinks we should offer fifteen lakhs with exchange of territory and twenty without it. I have had few opportunities of meeting Sultan and ascertaining his views about real estate and would not disagree with Felly, but I am consulting Hickinbotham and will then give final opinion, ^s regards price of lease it must be remembered that Bahrain get Rs. 14,000 per annum from their aerodrome and Sharjah Rs, 32,000 so I do not thin]/ anything less than Rs. 50,000 with say a cash bonus of one lakh would appeal to Sultan. I an ascertaining amounts received from B.O.A.cf. in customs dues which will have important bearing. It would be advisable to leave oil Royalties with Sultan whether island is purchased or leased as thought that he might be losing possible goldmine would make him drive much harder bargain. 3. Your para. 3 (a) is the only and (b) would not merely be gratuitous affront Residency bit would be most unlikely to appeal problems in hasirah 'are either economically or connected with : uscat and only effective method reasonable course to Persian Gulf to Sultan, iill administratively will be to give Political ^gent necessary jurisdiction. I do not anticipate any practical difficulties and a minor official should suffice. 4. I agree that it would not be very easy to treat with Sultan, in hotel bed room and he might make an excuse of not having his papers which-he could not do in his own territories. I think however you should know that I applied in npril for 28 months leave with effect from 1st. Jure.

It raifiee difficult problems in connection vd th the legal interpretation of the iiziglo-French Be deration of 1862 regarding the independence of Huecat• 2. The International Agreemente chiefly concerned are ^1) the Anglo- French Declaration of 1862 ©id (2) the Exolublve Agreement of 20th Harch 1891 between Great Britain and Mutcat. (1) Hie Anglo-French Declaration of 1862 places on record tha t Gr e a t^SrltEjrn fnd IVanc e * taking into coiit id e r a t i on th e imp cr t - ance of maintaining the independence of Hie Hi^ineeb the Sultan of Muecat ard Hie Highriecc the Sultan of Zanzibar have thought it right to engage reciprocally to respect the independence of these sovereignu ^, • (2) The Exclusive Agreement of 1891 between Great Bri tain and Mu pc at re cor &amp; 8 that tTe Sulten of iSuscai w doeB pielge end bind him self, 'hie heire and eucceak.ore, never to cede, to sell, to mortgage, or otherwise give for occupation save to the British Government, the dominions of Muscat and Oman or any cf their dependencies*. The latter agreement (which mqy be regarded as being inconsistent with the terms of the Anglo-French Declaration of 1862), has never j been officially communicated tc the French Government by H.K.G. and the French Vice-Consul at Muscat in 1899 stated to the Sultan that he could not recognise it as it was contrary to the Declaration of 1862. 3o ' The leading case in connection with the interpretation of the 1862 Declaration is the Bunder Gibf eh incident of 1899 which arose out of the grant by the Sultan of a coaling station to the French Government in Muscat territory. under threat of bombard ment, the Sultan was prevailed upon by us to cancel the concession on the grounds that it was inconsistent with the Exclusive Agreement of 1891. In bis die cushions with the French Ambassador, Lord Salisbury took the line that it was impossible consistently with the 1862 Treaty for the Sultan to lease any portion of his territory to either Power as a Sovereign State. This interpretation was at first disputed by the French but later accepted,, the French Ambass ador stating that *the French Government accepted our reading of the Treaty of 1862 that neither State might accept any cession or lease of Muscat territory'. It lias since proved embarrassing to us, since the French can now use it against us in the exact sense in which Lord Salisbury used it against them, to hinder us from acquiring any lease of Muscat territory. 4. In the case of the Khor ^uwai proposal it was agreed among the Departments of His Mejesty *s Government concerned that so long as there was no question of establishing defensive works, fly ing a fj^g. or acquiring any territorial or sovereign rights or other rights prejudicial to the sovereignty of the Sultan of Muscat, no ^ objection oould reasonably be taken by the French under the terms of the 1862 Declaration. As regards the use of Khor quwai in war ' time the point was made that if we proposed to use the place in war time in a wey which would be inconsistent with its position in1?) we neutral territory, it would be impossible to contend that^were 'maintaining the indepandenoa of' the Sultan in accordance with the 1862 Beclarati on•' ¥he conclusion was reached however that this difficulty wuld cipappifcr if Kuscat wei*e to beconie a belligerent, and that it was difficult to imagine a war in which it would be essential for Bri ti?3h forces to use Hior ^uwai without its being equally essential fror? the point of view of major British interests that Muscat should be induced to become a belligerent, an event * tfiich could probably be secured without difficulty. These limit ations on our position gave rise to no difficulty in the case of Khor v^uwai, since all that v/as required was the use of the Island for recreational purposes and the erection on it of a few auall buildings etc. fha question of control over Muscat*s subjects did not arise. 5. In the case of Katsirah, however, it ia clear that such limit ations would not be at all in accordance with ^iiat the Air Ministry desire, since their requirement is upccilioally for a permanent R.A.F. base which could be used for strategical purposes (involving presumably the construction cf defensive works) and control over the local inhabitants. However, the situation has changed a good deal since 1934. Xu the fir at place the French, as the Political Resident points out, have no longer any interest whatever in Muscat* In the second place the Foreign Office were previously anxious about the necessity of avoiding infringi ng Muscat neutrality in the event of war should we wish to use the Khor ^uwai depot in war conditions. It was then assumed that the position would Inevitably be covered by Muscat being brought in as a belligerent. Otherwise we would, cease to use Khor (^uwai • Actually war has come, and ttet has not been the way in tfiich things have worked out. Muscat still remains, technically at any rate, neutral, though at the start of the war the Sultan agreed to give us any naval or air facilities in his territories which we might require, in return for a subsidy and a guarantee of protection against external attack, and a promise that he should be a party to the Peace Treaty to the extent that, it might involve Muscat territory and Muscat interests. The French were our allies at the beginning of the war when these arrangements were concluded in November 1939 and it is doubtful whether they ever knew of them at all. Whether they would have thought fit to complain of the arrangements with the Sultan on the score of the 1862 Declaration cannot in the circumstances be stated. It wou3d seem in any case that we mould have justified the establish ment of a base on Hfefireh Island (wfosre cf course the R.A.F. are already operating) as part of our ese®itial war measures, in which at any rate originally the French were equally interested, and we could simply take the line with the French if they should ever raise the point that the oirouns tances of the war had made the 1862 , Declaration obsolete, but that in any case we had not done anything to infringe the independence of the Sultan. This is in fact the line taken by the Goverume.it of India in their telegram Ro.2758 of the nth March, which hae now been received. If the Foreign Office agree therefore, we might ignore ary possible difficulty with the French arising from the 1862 Declaration. (In any case it is very doubtful whether tne line ta^an by Lord Sailsoury in 1899 was legally correct, since it might be arguable that it was an ijinfriugement of the Ruler’s independence to refuse to allow him to fl!alienate or lease a portion cf hia territory if he wished to do so). 6. Assuming that this difficulty can be ignored, the Govern ment of India suggest that we should proceed to negotiate with the Sultan, placing the objects of our negotiations in the following Order :- (a) Exchange of Maslrah Island for the Kuria Muria Islands, accompanied by canh ccmpent ati on. An exchange arrangement of this kind wculd help to save the Sultan’s face, and might possibly be a useful argument against French or otlxr outside cb~cations. / it)(b) Straight*carwtrd purohaae of the island without any question of an exchange* $he Poi-itical Resident hao given 10 lakhs (£ 75,000) as a tentative price* (o) Lease* 7* Under either cf th* first two solutions the sovereignty of the Island would pase to H*M.G. and control of the inhabitants would be in thoir hands. In the case of a leate only, would any awkward questions in regard to control of the inhabitants arise? Ihe Political Reel dent considers that the Sultan, aho is very jealous of his jurisdiction over his subjects, would certainly not cede jurisdiction in the case of o, lease* This is an argument in favour of purchase rather th&amp;n lease, hut in my case the difficulty could probably be ^pt round* It is suggested that whatever arrangements may be come to the Suite’s control ovrr the inhabitants should be exercised through existing political machinery. Presumably the Air Ministry would be prepared *fc&gt; a^ee to this £8 in their letter of the 25th January they said that a satisfactory agreement must * give the lt&gt;cal Bri 11 sh Author 11iee adequate powers to control local Inhabitania and to excluie interference by tribal disturbances. 8* There remains a fourth alternative which was suggested by the Air Ministry at the end of their letter, namely? the grant under treaty of a n air bese on terms similar to those enjoyed by the R*A.y* in Bgypt ard Iraq. This, however, would net seem to be a very suitable arrangement* In the case of ligypt and Iraq a provisional air base was a part of a general treaty settlement, whereas in Muscat we should have to have a special ad hoc treaty * This would be making rather heavy weather of the m&amp;Tter, and would also give it undue publicity #iich in view of the position vis-a-vis the Branch we should prefer to avcid.- 2 • ■ * Not-te. .foy Lo, ■A-lvQS* fc *»' • ’•••i •- r -r'n wCQ ♦ I oan see no possibility of actually distinguishing between what the Air Ministry want now from what France was prevented from getting in 1899 f and I presume it will be for the Cabinet to decide how far it is necessary or desirable to give effect t&gt; or resile from the unfortunate position t aken up by the then Foreign Secretary. Apart from the above I should myself have said that assuming that no political pressure was brought to bear, aid that the transaction was manifestly beneficial to the Sultan from © financial point of view, the purchase from him of an island which formed part of his territory could not fairly be held to be an act inconsistent with our engagement to respect his independence. The whole point I apprehend is really tie implication of political pressure that tends inevitably to arise in my case where a powerful state enters into an a greement of t his nature with one which could in actual fact easily be coerced into consenting. Otherwise, it is difficult to see what reason there is for the suggestion that the independence of the Ruler of the selling State is not being respected - any more than for example in the case where the U.S.A. purchased Louisiana from Napoleon in 1803 for £3,000,000. As to the actual approach to be made to the Sultan, I am by no means certain that the best course would not be fcr the Political Resident to put to the Sultan in the fJLrst inplamca a proposal for a lease only, with a hint, if the Sultan showed hesitation, that K.M.G. might, if necessary, be prepared to go so far as to purchase outright. It may be that the latter proposition would appeal to the Sultan if the figure was a tempting one • which we could very well afford in t he present circumstances «* and if so, the eagerness of the Sultan might well effect any suggestion that political pressure was brought to bear. Hota on Maslrah Island. Masirah Island, which fams part of the Sultanate of Omi^ is situated off the South Eastern coast of Arabia. It is 40 miles in length and between 4 and 10 miles in breadth, and lies about 10 miles from the mainland. Good water is obtainable on the Island but it is almost destitute of vegetation. *he climate is stated to be not unhealthy. ^he permanent population is said by Lorimer to be about 600 in normal times. The Sultan has not displayed any very active interest in the Island. There are, however, two Sheikhs who have interests there, Sheikh Khamis bln Hilal who Ascribes himself as the w Sheikh of Masirah”, and Sheikh Sa f eed bln Sultan al Maja f ala. The latter Sheikh is from the mainland and his relations with Sheikh Khamis are somewhat involved, the latter being apparently dependent on his goodwill for visits to the mainland for supplies of any kind. A considerable amount of trouble was eicountered with the local inhabitants of Masirah Island in 1942, in connection with the unloading of stores for H.M. Forces stationed there. Sheikh Sa'eed bin Sultan a &gt;pears to have been primarily res ponsible fo r most of the trouble caused and as a result ttucxK coanauaanix, wanr* gg) h&amp;s been warned off the island by the Sul ten • As a result of these occurences, most of the local inhabitants fled from the Island and only a few nave since returned.

Ext. 1086/44. India Office, Whitehall, London, S.W.l. SECRET. 2lst March 1944. Dear Dean, We have now received replies from the political Resident in the Persian Gulf and the Government of India to the telegram which we sent to them on the lith February, based upon the Air Ministry’s letter No. R.S.1521/S.6 of the 25th January, on the subject of the proposed purchase or lease of Masirah Island. Copies of these telegrams have already been circulated to the Air Ministry and other interested Departments. 2. The Anglo-French Declaration of 1862 to which the Poli tical Resident refers, affirmed that Great Britain and France •taking into consideration the importance of maintaining the independence of H.H. the Sultan of Muscat, and H.H. the Sultan of Zanzibar have thought it right to engage reoripocally to respect the independence of these Sovereigns*• She exclusive Agreement of 1891 which the Political Resident also mentions, was between Great Britain and Muscat, am recorded that the Sultan of Muscat 'does pledge and bind himself, his heirs and successors, never to cede to sell, to mortgage or otherwise give for occupation save to the British Government, the dominions of Muscat and Oman or any of their dependencies.* 2he latter Agreement Yhich may be held to be not altogether consistent with the terms of the Anglo-French Declaration of 1862, has never been officially communicated to the French Government by His Majesty’s Government and the French Vice Consul at Muscat in 1899 told the Sultan that he could not recognise it as it was contrary to the Declaration of 16 62. 3. In 1899 there was a dispute with the French over the grant by the Sultan of a coaling station in Muscat territory to the French Government, and under threat of bombardment the Sultan was prevailed upon ty us to cancel the concession on the grounds that it was inconsistent with the exclusive Agreement of 1891. In discussions with the French Ambassador over this dispute. Lord Salisbury, then Foreign Secretary, took the line that it was impossible consistently with the 1862 Treaty for the Sultan to lease any portion of his territory to either power as a Sovereign State. This interpretation of the effects of the 1862 Declaration, Which was eventually accepted by the French Government, has subsequently proved a considerable embarras^ment since the French could always use it against us to prevent us from acquiring any lease of Muscat territory. 4. It was for this reason that when in 1934 His Majesty’s Government desired to establish a naval depot at Khor tyuwai the Sultan was merely asked to grant his permission. There was no question of a lease being secured and it was expressly stated that the British flag would not be flown. It was assumed that if war broke out and it was desired to use %or C^uwai in a way that would not be consistent with its position in a neutral country, which would lay us open to a charge of infringing the Declaration of 1862, the difficulty would be surmounted by persuading the Sultan of Muscat to become a belligerent. Actually the position of Muscat in this war still remains technically at any rate that of a neutral, though at the beginning of the war the Sultan agreed M.J .

The British Government acquired a base either by the purchase or exchange of Masirah Island for Kuria Muria or the lease of whole or part of the island. The main concern raised by British Officials was on how to approach the Sultan of Muscat and Oman on the issue. They argued that the Sultan will be unlikely to agree to sell or exchange Masirah Island, for the fact that one day the island might prove to contain mineral and/or oil deposits of commercial value.The file contains correspondence related to the availability of drinking water for the Royal Air Force and native labourers on the island, and the future of the administration of the island after an agreement takes place.The file also contains correspondence, folios (144-160) related to the incident of a group of Royal Air Force men shooting eleven civilian-owned goats at Masirah Island. The Sultan raised the issue with the Political Agent at Muscat and he suggested that the Royal Air Force men should be kept within their airbase boundaries in order to prevent such incidents.The main correspondents in the file are: the Government of India, Foreign and Political Department; India Office, London; the Political Agency, Muscat; the Persian Gulf Residency, Bahrain; and the Government of Muscat and Oman.A large part of the file, folios 2-117, is dated 1944.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><topic>Air force</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Āl Bū Sa'īd Dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent; subject</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Royal Air Force</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Masirah</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Airfields</topic></subject><subject><topic>Oil extraction</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000316#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
