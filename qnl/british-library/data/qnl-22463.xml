Dear Sir, I am sending herewith Abdul Rahman, the Agency nakhuda, and should be obliged if you would examine his eye sight and let me have a report. Yours faithfully. for Political Agent,Bahrain1861 -1/6. Political Agency, Bahrain, the 22nd October 1939. To The Political Officer, Tnicial Coast, Sharjah. Memorandum Reference your memorandum ITo# nil dated the 17th October 1939. 2. The scale of pay of Agency farashes is Rs. 20-1- 30. Is it not possible to engage a man on the initial rate of pay in the usual way. Would you please also let me know the date on which the farash was engaged. I for Political Agent, Bahrain.1*2 A.?.A. Muhammad Qayim Farash whenever asked by one of the staff in one department to bring stationary or some other office articles has the habit, persumably through laziness, of taking the required object from another department without permission, and not from office stocks. This morning he came to our office and picked up a stationary tray without permission, I noticed him and told him not to take it. He insisted on taking it and I told him not be meddlesome when he became highly excited, created a row and pa-ssed some insulting remarks in the presence of H.M. / / U /. //.f.J\ /&gt;? .ted October 22nd bhtr Oct. 27th. 1939 The Political Agent Bahrain o.

I am afraid that I could not offer Ahmed, ferraeh, lees than Ks* 30/- per month* I would ask; you to consider that, touring large -tic tehee of country as I heve now to qo , I must have a more reliable type of man than one who ajut mey be capable, for Instance, of taking chits round Men amah on a bicycle. Moving camp, for example, inloolves a lot of local bandobast, which I cannot always persorgpialiy supervise an# I need a man whom I can trust to deliver letters and messages in a proper manner» 3. There is also the question of my ferr eh's being on tout for cm eicerable periods, which involves him in extra donestic expense. I had contemplated making Re. 39/- an inclusive rate, and not indeutlng on Bahrain for Daily Allowance fro him. If I were to do so at the rates paid to Agency ferrashes and khalessis when on tour.h. would draw more than Rs. 30/-, even if his basic pay were only Rs. 20/-. A. Taking also into account that I have asked only for one ferraeh. I cannot feel that my demands for establishment have been immode/rate 5. Ahmed is aleo reported to be a driver, which would be useful If it were found poesible to let me have a station waggon. 6- He was engaged on Oct* 13th* Political Officer, Trucial Coast.Bahrain.

Since Ali has to report to A.P.A. in the afternoon, and it seems befitting that Head i?arrash should be exempt from the afternoon duty, perhaps you may consult I,A. that his two farrashes should take regular turns wt the afternoon duty from today.

Since the I.A^ Ear ashes were put on eyening duty I have 'been experiencing great difficulties as the farashes do not attend the I.A's Court in the morning in time? I have to 'beg the head far ash every day to send me one or two farashes. I have iiever found the two farashes ready for work at 7 a.m. when I attended the office and on occasions I had to open the office, doors and windows myself. On the 9th September I did not findAg^r farashes in the morning and I had to call Ahmed, the so called head farash, and beg him to send me farashes. On the 12th September the same thing happened again and I had to open the office myself and call Abdul Hadi to come and clean it. I then called Ahmed and asked him to arrange for another person to take the turn of Abdul Hadi if he was on duty on that day, and he willingly agreed to make the necessary arrangement, I require 2 farasheb as I have to deal with 100 men and women every day and it is not adviseafele to delay the Court work or close the Court for the sake of Ahmed farash who does not understand his own duty. I have attended the office almost every afternoon and though I required, sometimes, a farash I did not ask for one. Abdul Hadi is not to be blpjned as he is the only farash who has attended the office and has even swept it because the sweeper comes for sweeping when he feels inclined to do so. Ahmed is to be fined one or tv/o rupees for (1) not sending farashes in the morning in time to I.A's Court, imspite of my repeated requests and (2) for not making the necessary arrangements for a farash for the afternoon duty on 12th though he assured me do so,. i iN.A &amp;^/l* C *4^ ^ _y ✓ -^rt^ fkr£s&lt; J tyl/t'C^v*'*-/ d&lt;~ A^ ^ - R ef;psges 295-29 7 Applicants informed that there is no vacancy of a Farresh. ^ay file pi. 22/10/42 ho ^^^^3 ^ ^ ' l/u ^ /P'-^ jh^-lof ft*, '^v^- x,r^ . ^dS '-H- ^ ^ ^ 4?sf X ~oy^ -/XX^ Ref.bQg , Tahir bin Moharaed ex-frrrrsh served in this Agency for a period of 4 years until in March 1942,he fell sick and remained absent without lerve for a period of one month.During this period he failed to report for treatment &lt;vO to the Agency Surgeon ps well,and a consequence thereof he was not considered to be sick.His services ^ere therefore dispensed with with effect from 1st May 1942(P.58 and 59 L .F.
