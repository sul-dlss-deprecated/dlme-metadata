T.'i-uh reference to the entry under 'General' in this office Diar u for week ending 9th February, there is a report current in Koweit that the boom, which was capuured in February last and uaken back uo Muscat / oe- -longs to Haji Mahomed Taqi and not to the French firm as it was stated then, it is now said that uhe Nakhoda of the boom book the rifles on board on his own res- -ponsibility and without bhe knowledge of the owners. But this would seem im- probable and the owners ire probably try ing to throw the whole blame on the Nakhoda as Sheikh Mobarak intends punishing the offenders severely. The report at the time of the capture said that the boom had been sold and had been purchased b., the 7 French firm of Mons. Goguyer and she was sailing under the French flag. Her / a Hi / /- Nakhoda when he was ordered to put back fWtrtJLeM y ' JUU' -^o Muscat and discharge her cargo^ shewed A A . I V / the British gun-boats the French flag and told them that the boom as well as her cargo were uhe property of thewas a French subject. On arrival ab Muscat the matuer was reported no the French fim &amp; uhe French Consulate . The., declined uo discharge the boom demanding from the British Tovt. 4 lakhs of rupees(2 lakhs cost of uhe rifles and 2 lakhs for damages). It is said that the boom had on board about 5000 rifles and ammuninion which calculated at /35 per rifle would work out approximately to 2 lakhs. On being declined to discharge • the boom, it is said, the British au- -thorities told the nakhoda he could sai^ away wherever he liked but this tM* was not done and the matter reported 'v to the French Govt. It is said that these rifles were intended for tne house of Haji Mahomed Tapi and several others in Koweit among them being Moolla Abdulla the ex Secretary of / Sheikh Mobarak. This man has now taken to this trade and is one of the agents for the French firms of Muscat. The consignment was arranged for by Bwaz bin Mahomed^son-in-law of HajiI 1 o •\ @ 2f Mahomed Taqi at Muscat and after finish- / ing details iilwaz himself returned to Koweiu a B.I.boat expecting to hear that the boom had left safely for Koweit. The following mail brought, him the news that the boom had been cap- -tured and taken back uo Muscat. On receiving this news Bwaz at, once left, for Muscat and since then he has been there trying his best to get, out of difficulties. The French firm,it is said, had guarranteed the owners for the safety of the boom and had promised to pa^, her price if anything happened to her. This is how probably t,he Na-\! &amp; no account the boom should be sold bhe French firm. The French firm have offered Rs.2500/- for uhe cost of the boom with some commission to the ila- khoda ii over uhe sale but the u dare not sell her for fear of the Sheikh. All the sailors of the boom have since returned to Kovreit except the Hakhoda who has taken a wife at Muscat and settled himself there. The boom is l^ing in Muscat with her cargo on board and a man to look after her whose wages are paid b^ the French firm. Dwaz bin Mahomed is still in Muscat &amp; it is said Haji Uajaf bin ( haleb of Bushire has authorised Bwaz to treat the case as he thinks best. The lauest news is that the French-man has left for Paris where he has been called for to give personal account in the case.Arms traffic 4*&lt;&gt;) X m 'v L o^HVv 1 ' V« r ith reference nhe entry under date 10th March in this office Diaiy for v/eeK ending 9th March, it is said that Haji Mahomed Hassan had, in the several parcels^ 30 Mauser pistols and 40 rifles in pieces and ammunition.

I have the honour to forward, for the information of the Government of India, a copy of the letter noted in the margin on the subject of the arms traffic which I have received from the Political Agent, Koweit. It throws an in teresting light on local opinion on the question at Koweit, and shows the far- reaching effect of the successful operations of our war-ships. No. 663, dated Koweit, the 29th December 1909 (Confidential). From— Captain W. H. I. Shakespear, Political Agent, Koweit, To—The First Assistant Resident, in charge of Residency, Bushire. I have the honour to refer to certain items in my recent weekly diaries regarding the arms traffic, of which copies are attached for ready reference. 2. A perusal of these extracts will give an idea of the manner in which the recent successes of H. M.’s ships in the suppression of this traffic have affected public opinion in Koweit. Certain merchants in conversation with whom the subject has cupped up have confirmed the diary reports. 3. On the other hand, the following is a brief account of what Sheikh Mubarak and his son Sheikh Jabir consider the proper pabulum for the Political Agent, and was volunteered by them in recent conversations. Sheikh Jabir said that the news of the successful captures had slightly affected sales in Koweit, but that the import into Koweit was so small (being in fact only sufficient for local consumption) Koweit was really outside the question. Sheikh Mubarak went further and expressed himself as glad to hear of the success of H. M/s ships, and added that no Koweit dhow had been captured as so few made a business of carrying cargoes of arms from Maskat. Koweit occasionally imported arms, but only just enough to meet the local demand. He also said that though dhow-owners took papers and even labelled the cases as for Koweit, they did not come to Koweit, but generally ran their cargoes on the Katif coast, whence the arms were distributed to the interior, Riadh, Hail, &amp;c., and most to the north among the Muntifich and other tribes from Zobeir along the Shatt-el-Arab to nearly as far as Baghdad. The ra^e for carriage, he informed me, were about $18 from the Katif coast to Nejd and about $23 from the same place to Zobeir and the north-west, in both cases the rate being based on a camel-load of 20 rifles without ammunition. He added that the traffic was largely in the hands of the Ajman Bedouin. He admitted that some of this overland traffic found its way to Koweit, but only a very small proportion, quite two-thirds of the imports going to the north. He said he had been accused by the Wali at Basrah of allowing Koweit to be used as a dep6t for forwarding arms to the Arab tribes on the river, but had pointed out to him that the real fault lay with the Turkish officials in Katif and Hassa. Both Chiefs remarked on our apparently fatuous policy of attempting to stop the traffic in the Persian Gulf without prohibiting manufacture in England and export thence, and instead employing the much more expensive machinery of ships-of-war to stop fast-sailing native craft over an area of hundreds of square miles of open sea. As a large proportion of the arms, at least of those in Koweit, are of English manufacture, no doubt the present policy does seem incomprehensible, and is answered, I am afraid, by the specious argu ment that the English Government does not desire to cause loss to its own manufacturers in England, but prefers to shift the burden of any such loss on to the shoulders of the native purchasers in Maskat. 4. In submitting the above my main object is to show that Sheikh Mubarak so far has not abandoned his old policy of attempting to hoodwink us as to the real state of the arms trade in Koweit, and not because I attach any value to the information volunteered, which I regret, I am convinced, is supplied solely for official consumption.Ill No. 244, dated Busbire, the 23rd January (received 1st February) 1910 (Confidential), From— Major A. P. Trevor, First Assistant Resident in charge of Residency, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. In continuation of my letter * No. 95, dated 9th January 1910, I have the * serial No. 40 . honour to forward, for the information No. c.-s, dated nth January 1910. of the Government of India, a copy of the letter noted in the margin which I have received from the Political A^ent, Koweit, on the subject of the arms traffic at that place. 2. Captain Shakespear’s letter is interesting as, although the numbers can- no^ he taken as strictly accurate, it probably gives a very fairly accurate idea of the state of the gun market in Koweit. It seems that “ it is an ill wind, &amp;C.,’ and that the Koweit oealers have benefited by the recent successes of His Majesty’s Ships against the arms traffic. I think there is no doubt that a large number of the rifles imported to Koweit—especially the better qualities —are destined to be smuggled into Turkish territory or into Persia. A brisk trade is carried on along the coast between Mohammerah and Bushire, the Khans of Dilam, Bunder Big and Rudhilla being large importers. Martini rifles are, however, rather despised now-a-days in Southern Persia; the great demand is for Martini Metfords, Mausers and Browning pistols. No. C.—3, dated Koweit, the 11th January 1910 (Confidential). From— Captain W. H. I. Shakespear, Political Agent, Koweit, To—The First Assistant Resident in charge of Residency, Bushire. I have the honour to refer to my lettert No. 663, dated the 29th December t Serial No. 40 . an( * to famish the following inter esting figures which have been confi dentially obtained as to the stock of arms and ammunition now in Koweit. The figures can only he taken as approximate though they were furnished by a man who himself deals in arms and is related to one of the largest importers. 2. The three largest importing firms, all Persians settled in Koweit, hold between them 9,600 rifles and 2,300 cases of ammunition. Five other firms, all Koweit Arabs, hold 3,400 rifles and 6,850 cases of cartridges, some of these getting their supplies from the Persians first mentioned. Various petty dealers may be credited with another 1,000 rifles and 850 cases of cartridges, making an estimated total of the stock in Koweit of 14,000 rifles and 10,000 cases of ammunition. The weapons are mostly Mauser and Martini carbines and largely of British manufacture. The total rounds of ammunition is not easily estimated for different makers pack quantities varying from 1,000 to 2,500 rounds per case. 3. The price retail of the cartridges is as low as 15 cartridges to a dollar whilst the cases are sold wholesale at Bs. 110 for a case of 1,500 Mauser rounds and 8150 for a case of Dixon’s containing 2,500 cartridges. O' o 4. A Bedouin recently arrived from Nejd averred that the price in Nejd for ammunition was 25 cartridges to a dollar, w r hich is probably to be accounted for by the cartridges being fired cases locally re-capped and filled with country gunpowder. 5. Though the Sheikh refused an open agency to Goguyer’s firm, most of the large Maskat dealers have representatives here in the persons of some of the dealers mentioned above, Goguyer, Mirza Husain, iVli Khan and Damodar all having agents. 6. It seems that the reason of the present large stock is that firms were bound by long forward contracts to take delivery in Maskat of certain quan tities at specified periods, which they could not cancel, whilst the actual demand in Kow r eit has not proved good enough to clear the supply. These dealers are now rather pleased at the set-back caused by the recent captures of dhows by His Majesty's Ships as it will enable them to obtain better orices for their existing stocks. 7. The ultimate destination of all these arms is difficult to ascertain, for by now every able-bodied man in the town certainly possesses a Martini carbine if not a superior weapon. A very large proportion, probably quite two-thirds, undoubtedly must be distributed among the Bedouin tribes and Central Arabia, and from the large interest in the trade held by Persians, who st ill have dealings with their own country, I am inclined to think that a large number must be imported into Persia along the coast north of Bushire.u ■^S DRAFT—(For Approv.il).

Cs- Sir, I have the honour to inform you that Haji Nejef bin Ghalib has asked me to explain to Sheikh Mubarek the circum stances under which he allowed the boom of which Mohamed Saleh was Nakhoda, to be sold. 2. Haji Nejef remained in touch with Major Trevor while the question was current, and I attach for your information a copy of this office letter No. 776 to the Foreign Department on the subject. I am giving Haji Nejef a note to Sheikh Mubarek of which I enclose a translation, but if Sheikh Mubarek mentions the matter, I request that you will also explain the position. I have the honour to be Sir, Your most obedient servant, 4 Lieut-Colonel, Political Resident in the Persian GulfCopy of a letter No. 776 dated 27th March 1910 from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, to the Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign* Department, Simla. (1) Telegram .No. 165 dated 18th March 1910 from Political Agent, Muscat, to Resident. (2) Telegram No. 255 dated 19th March 1910 from First Assistant Resident in charge of 5 Residency Bushire to Political Agent Muscat. { With reference to the correspondence ending with Foreign De partment Telegram No. S.166, dated the 12th instant, 1 have the honour to state that I communicated with the Political Agent, Koweit, and ashed him to speak to Sheikh Mobarak as to the ad visability of asking His Highness the Sultan to extradite the Nakhoda Mahomed Salem on a charge of attempted barratry. 2. After sending the above mentioned communication and when it was too late to cancel it, I received a telegram from the Political t Agent, Muscat, 0 5 informing me that 0 5 the sale of the dhow to Monsieur Goguyer’s Manager had been completed. On receiving this I sent for Haji Hejef as ne nad said nothing to me about the sale, though he had once or twice said that his dhow was rotting at anchor and that his agent could get no redress from either the British Consul or the French Consul or the Sultan. 3. Haji Nejef explained that the dhow had been lying in charge of nobody for more than a month and that Syed Yusuf Zawavi and his nephew Bwaz had frequently written pressing him to agree to the sale as their representations to the British and French Consuls and to the sultan had had no effect and the dhow was useless to him under such conditions. Haji Nejef added that eventually after thinking the matter over he considered that he had better accept the offer on the principle of the 'bird in hand'. Two thousand reals, he remarked, was a good deal better than the prolonged worry of getting possession of the dhow which might in the end prove to have deteriorated so much as to be practically useless. 4. Should the Sheikh of ivoweit agree to ask His Highness the Sultan to extradite Nakhoda Mohamed Salem, I do not think that the fact that the dhow has been eventually sold with the consent of'li .J. 3 of the owner need prevent the case proceeding. It was omy* after his boat had been lying idle and uncared for at Muscat for some 6 weeks or more that Nejef yielded to the force of circumstances. Jj ■y am* /53 of 1910 British fiosidancy &amp; Conaulate-Crenaral, Sheikh Mubarek-es-subah, Huler of i^oweit- A/C, Your dependent, Hajef bin Ghalib, has asked me to write to you regarding the sale by him of the boom, at Muscat. I was not here at the time and what hap pened about the boom was unsatisfactory, but I note from the record that Uajl Hajof did not fail to keep my locum tenens, Major Tre vor, fully informed of what was passing, and Major Trevor thought that in the end Haji Najef had no other course left him than to sell the vessel to whosoever would buy it, because his agent at Muscat informed him that it had been lying uncared for, for 6 weeks and thatvif sale was delayed longer, it would be without any value at all if indeed it was not wrecked altogether. Haji Najef did not sell it until he was obliged by these circum stances, and i therefore do not think that he personally deserves blame in the matter. May you be preserved and salaam.

I have written it with the idea that it may serve to corro borate or punctuate the several steps taken by Sheikh Mubarek; but if for any reason you think it unnecessary or inadvisable, please use your discretion to hold it over pending reference to me. 3 . I take the opportunity to thank you for your persevering and successful efforts to get the Sheikh to confiscate the consignment. 4. It is difficult to conjecture confidently the motive which prompted him to take the arms into his own custody, but I sup pose it was in order to make sure that he got the arms himself if all went well, or was in a position to hand them back to the French subjects concerned if the latter made themselves incon veniently impleasant and he did not get adequate support from us.

I have finally learnt from him that you have preferred to take them into your own custody and have now placed them under a guard in your Customs House and will not allow them to be moved without the knowledg^ of the British authorities. That is all good. The object is, as you know, to prevent them falling again into the hands of undesirable people. This contraband traffic in arms is an evil thing which you as Ruler of Koweit are fully justified in stamping out and it is not likely that the French Government will support their dependents in smuggling the arms into your very town in spite of your well-known prohibition. If they do make any complaint to you on the subject you may rest assured that the Bri tish Government will take your part in replying to it and will support you in upholding your just rights and keeping contraband arms out of your territory. and consantt ransl at ion of a letter dated the 15th Jamadi-al-awal 1^32 from, sheikh M^barak-as-Siibah 9 Ruler of &amp; v/eit to Ooloenel^ Oox, Political Resident , Bush Ire.

With reference to my telegram Nos. 488 and 515 dated 1 ith and 18th May respectively, I have the honour to forward herewith, for the information of the Government of India, copies of the telegraphic communications between the Political Agent, Kuwait, and myself, resulting in the confiscation or attachment of the cargo of arms and ammunition landed in Kuwait from the Sambooq “ Fateh-al-Khair, 5 ’ flying the French Flag and purporting to be owned by Messrs. Goguyer &amp; Co. I also enclose copies of Captain Shakespear’s letters written during the pro gress of his negotiations with the Shaikh in which he records at length the details of his conversations with the Shaikh and of the procedure followed. It may be convenient for the Government of India to have these for reference in case the incident should give rise to controversy. 2. It will be remembered that in Foreign Department telegram No. 8.-199, dated 27th March, I was given discretion to make certain communications to the Shaikhs of Kuwait, Bahrein, Muhammerah and the Trucial Coast Ports. In this connection I would explain that in the case of Muhammerah, where the Customs are administered by the Belgian regime and where the Director would in the ordinary course be only too glad to confiscate for the Persian Government any contraband consignment of which he got information, a communication in the sense indicated seemed hardly needed. In the cases of the other Shaikhs mentioned, specially the Trucial Chiefs, the questions of temporary custody anld eventual delivery or payment of compensation were somewhat difficult matters to handle and needed different and cautious treatment in each case; l was therefore anxious to deal with them on the spot in personal communication with the Shaikhs and British representatives concerned on my pre-hotweather visit to the Arab Coast Ports. The outbreak of Plague in Bushire, however, with its consequent quarantine difficulties and the difficult situation in the Shatt-el- Arab had delayed me from week to week and no communication had been made to Shaikh Mubarak when the arrival of this consignment at Kuwait was reported. 3. It will be seen that Captain Shakespear had a very difficult task to get the Shaikh to act up to his obligations, and that the latter has since done his best to make it appear that we are entirely responsible for the seizure. I find it difficult to believe that Shaikh Mubarak’s demeanour in this respect was really attributable to any doubt as to whether he would have our support, and think the truth more probably is that he is compromised, by correspondence or other wise, with Messrs. Goguyer &amp; Co., and realises that the only basis on which he can justify the seizure to them is the excuse that the British authorities insisted on it and that he had no choice but to comply. His desire, on further considera tion, to get the arms back into his own custody is not I think far to seek. On the one hand if he finds himself at issue with the French and we, having regard to his soiled hands, find it difficult to support the seizure, he will so be enabled to restore the arms when his position becomes too awkward. On the other hand, if his action proves indefeasible, he will be sure of getting the arms or their value for himself, possession being nine points of the law. 4. As to the legal aspect of the seizure, we must perhaps be prepared for the contingency of Messrs. Goguyer &amp; Company being able to show that in sending2 the consignment to Kuwait they had been given by Shaikh Mubarak reason to believe that he had no objection to the importation and that consequently the seizure must have been doe solely to pressure from us and not to the Shaikh’s own motion, as we would have them believe. But our position in the matter vis-tSt-vis the French Government seems so strong, specially in view of the recent French refusal to give us the right of search over dhows under their Flag, that there does not appear to me to be any strong reason why we should not frankly accept the onus of having insisted on the seizure by the Shaikh. At all events I submit that the advantage from an Arms Traffic point of view of seizing this trial consignment, a fact which Captain Shakespear writes “ has caused the greatest consternation in Kuwait/' greatly outweighs the seriousness of the possible complication which may arise from the Shaikh being proved to have been in collusion with Goguyer &amp; Co. In the latter case, while we shall have effected what was necessary in the execution of our measures for the suppression of the Arms Traffic, we shall at the same time have cleared the atmosphere between ourselves and the Shaikh and have so unmasked him that he will no longer be able to persevere with the obvious insincerities and mental reservations which distinguish his communica tions to us in connection with the Arms Traffic.

Shakespear, Political Agent, Kuwait, To—The Political Resident in tne Persian Gulf, Bushire. In continuation of my letter No. C.-o, dated the 2nd March 1910, I have the honour to report what, as far as I am at present aware, is an entirely new development in the Arms iraffic. 2. To take matters in their proper sequence I would recall the seizure of a Kuwait “boom” with arms on board by H. M. S. “Hyacinth” about the 27th lanuary 1910 near Muttra. It will be remembered that this “ boom ” was allowed to proceed after inspection but was taken back to Maskat with her cargo by her Kuwaiti Nakhuda, Muhammad Saleh, Of the course of the case in Maskat 1 have no knowledge, but it appears that the Nakhuda, without the knowledge of the *'boom’s ” owners, entered into some illegal contract for her sale to the French firm of Goguyer_et Cie. # Shaikh Mubarak becoming aware of this so-called sale, and claiming jurisdiction over the “ boom ” as carrying Kuwait colours and papers, and over both her owners and Nakhuda as being Kuwait subjects, addressed His Highness the Sultan of Maskat requesting extradition of Muhammad Saleh for trial in Kuwait. His Highness replied to the Shaikh that the Nakhuda had already left Maskat. It is worthy of note that Muhammad Saleh also disregarded the Shaikh’s orders— those in which he informed his agents in Maskat sometime in January that no “ booms ” were to leave Maskat with arms except with the written permission of the British Political Agent. This precaution was taken by the Shaikh, I imagine, to safeguard his subjects’ property from confiscation by British men-of-war. Such are the preceding facts and the Shaikh rested, awaiting an opportunity to bring the offending Muhammad Saleh to trial. 3. Yesterday I was informed by the Shaikh that a Maskat “ sambuk ” had arrived with a cargo of arms with the offending Nakhuda Muhammad Saleh on board, and that he would be glad of my views before dealing with the case as the vessel was a different one belonging to Maskat. I went to see the Shaikh at once, and advised him, that so far as Muhammad Saleh was concerned, I saw no le^al difficulty in his having him apprehended at once for the same offence and on the same grounds, on which he had already asked the Sultan of Maskat for his extradition. As for the “sambuk” and her cargo, in virtue of his own noti- hcation of May 1900, and his recent orders to his agents in Maskat, confiscationof the arms by him would appear to be legal, but seeing that the “ sambuk ” belonged to Maskat, and the arms also probably to Maskat or French subjects, it would be politic to hold them in suspense pending a reference to you. 4. At this time I was not made aware of the full details of the case, nor do I think that the Shaikh himself knew any more, but later in the evening it appeals the Shaikh summoned the boat’s Nakhuda, and then sent his Secretary to me with her papers, from which it appears that the “sambuk” is French subjects’ pro perty—that of Goguyer et Cie—carries French ship’s papers, all so far as I can judge in order, and sails under the French Flag. This denouement of course entirely altered the case. Time did not admit of my making copies of the papers, but they consisted of the following:— (a) A “ Titre de Navigation ” in which the sambuk is described as the “Fateh-al-khair,” built in Debai, of i»9 tons, belonging “ala Maison Goguyer citoyen fran9ais residant k Mascate et k la Societe fran9aise des munitions reprdsentde par Mr. Neauber,” commanded by Jandok bin Sendan, and entitling her to sail under the French Flag. The document assigns the vessel “ Lettre Signaletique M ”, and “ No description i,” and is dated the 12th February 1910 over the signature and seal of the French Consul at Maskat. There are several manuscript emendations in the printed text, which seem to show, that the form is one usually used in French colonies, as well as a note specially absolving the Captain of the boat from being a French subject. (b) A Crew Agreement form with the names of 11 men, of whom 10 are described as Maskat subjects and one, the last, the offending Muhammad Saleh as “ Mahbub bin Saleh, sujet turc de Kuwait, 70 ans, 1 m, 10, capittaine en ler, embarque le 24 mars 1910 ” The agreement is signed by 3 persons, A. Elbaz being the only decipherable signature. In this document the vessel is also “ autorise k naviguer sous pavilion fran9ais pour faire la naviagtion dans la mer des Indes et le Golfe Persique”; it is dated the 12th February 1910 at Maskat over the French Consul’s signa ture. She has made several voyages to Sohar in Oman, and the last endorsement reads c&lt; Expedie de Mascate le 25 mars 1910 allant a Kuwait et Basrah charge d’armes et munitions ayant 11 homes d'equipage et—passagers.” (c) A Bill of Health, certifying Maskat as a clean port of departure, issued by the French Consulate. 5. In view of these papers, the Shaikh again desired my advice, and I informed his Secretary, that I saw no reason to change my mind as regards the Nakhuda Muhammad Saleh, who, as a Kuwait subject charged with an offence in respect of a Kuwait “ boom ”, could not escape the Shaikh’s jurisdiction in Kuwait itself simply by the fact of being one of the crew of a boat flying French colours. I suggested therefore that he should be apprehended, and his case proceeded with, as the Shaikh had originally intended. As regards the boat and her cargo, it was doubtful if the Shaikh’s notification of May 1900 could be held to apply in its entirety, and in my opinion the best course for the Shaikh would be to abide by the spirit of his notification and late order to his Maskat agents, by informing the Captain of the boat, that he had specifically prohibited the import of arms into Kuwait, and the boat and her cargo had better there fore return to Maskat, or continue her voyage to Basrah, for he would not allow her cargo to be landed in Kuwait. 6. The Shaikh’s Secretary then said a difficulty would arise, for the Nakhuda Muhammad Saleh was the only one of the crew who had any knowledge of the northern part of the Persian Gulf. My reply was that, in that case, the Captain (for Muhammad Saleh is not the real Captain of the boat) w’as at liberty to engage any of the many other pilots available in Kuwait; or if be elected to stay, be would do so on his own initiative and at his own risk after fair warning from the Shaikh. 1 saw no reason in this small difficulty for releasing Muhammad Saleh. After this the Shaikh’s Secretary took his leave and it remains to be seen hew the Shaikh acts in the matter.4 ' J 7. My object throughout, and I explained it carefully to the Shaikh’s Secretary, is to avoid any possibility of the Shaikh becoming entangled through points of maritime law with the French Consulate in Maskat, and I trust the advice l gave, will meet with your approval. Having no recent knowledge of how the arms traffic question is being handled at presen , nor any papers to which to refer, regarding either our own or the French Consul’s position in the matter of these native craft in these waters, I am considerably handicapped when the Shaikh asks me for information or, in rare instances, like the present, for advice. 8. The Shaikh seems to have been much impressed by the “ sambuk ” flying a French flag and appears genuinely anxious for our advice in order no doubt not to compromise himself with either the French, British or Turkish 0 ^ Governments. 9 This report is written as the mails are being closed and I am sending to Fao a telegram which I trust will give sufficiently early information to admit of my receiving some general instructions for the Shaikh by the mail of the 4th May in the event of the “ sambuk ” not having left Kuwait or the Shaikh ignor- ing my suggestions. (Confidential) No. C-22 dated Kuwait, the 4th May 1910. From— CAPTAIN W. H. I. SHAKESPEAR, Political Agent, Kuwait, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. In continuation of my letter No. 19-C., of the 28th April 1910 and subse quent telegrams, 1 have the honour to report further developments in the case of the “ sambuk M which brought arms to Kuwait on the 27th April under the French Flag. 2. I attach a copy of a note I made on the 1st May immediately after my interview with the Shaikh which gives in detail what passed between us. I waited for the Shaikh’s promised official letter until 3 P.M. the following day and from independent sources having ascertained other facts which further convinced me that Shaikh Mubarak did not intend any effective measures, if indeed he was not actually thwarting us, 1 sent my boat to Fao with my second telegram. 3. The further facts which I have been able to glean are :— (tf) that it is extremely probable the arms were landed in broad daylight and not at night as described by the Shaikh ; (&amp;) that only the ordinary duty of $ 6 a rifle was levied on them, and therefore the Shaikh in no way penalised these arms ; (c) that the Shaikh took part of the consignment for his own use as is his usual custom from all arms landed in Kuwait. My information is that the consignment was 400 rifles and several cases of ammuni tion, of which the Shaikh took 120 rifles and probably some ammunition too. The Shaikh told me the consignment consisted of 321 rifles, an odd and improbable figure. (d) that the consignee in Kuwait is Messrs. Goguyer et Cie’s local agent, one Mullah Abdullah Atiji, a Kuwaiti Arab, who was formerly Shaikh Mubarak’s Secretary. ^ The Shaikh’s absolute power in Kuwait makes it impossible for the consign ment to have been landed secretly and against his orders as he alleges, and accordingly to my mind there is not the slightest doubt of the Shaikh’s active connivance in the case. 4. I waited until the forenoon of to day (4th May) in order to give the Shaikh ample time to send me his promised official letter, and nothing having been received up to that time, I sent a message to say I should like to call on him at 4-30 P.M. 5 So much of this letter was drafted when I received your telegram No. 441, dated the 3rd May, just before proceeding to see the Shaikh again. . .5 Healthi^ fl \i r i! 16 “^J 1 1 en&lt; l ,1 ' red from the Shai'th first how he had tha tholi thp 1 a 'a' the a U ;' aiti Nakhuda ' The Shaikh i,lformcd Arahir ^? h a h k ^ h3d ad ™ t ‘ ed hls authority, he produced a document in bound hv g y the • renCh - C ° L nSUl in Maskat ' setti 'S out ‘He man was to wltL rP^r^k' 0 P “ 0t ,he ' sam Huk ” to Kuwait or Basrah and back 3 j k t ’ P 6 Sha| kh accordingly allowed him to leave in the “ sambuk ” y • , • but be as sured me he intended to punish the man when he next came witnin nis reach. 7- Having ascertained that the arms were still unsold with Goguyer et Cie’s local agent, I informed the Shaikh of the receipt of your telegram No. 441, urged upon him that Government expected him in this instance to fulfil his obligations gave him reasons for the course, assured him of Government’s s upp ort and pointed out that if he confiscated the arms landed in contravention ot his old prohibition and recent express orders (as he had himself intimated to me) and lodged them in the Agency under my charge, he had nothing to fear from the French Consul in Maskat. I pointed out that the reason for asking him to lodge the confiscated arms in the Agency was to prevent them passing again into the hands of dealers and thereby convincing such dealers that importation cunu r of ^ he Shaikh’s prohibition would be a profitless enterprise. The bhaikh listened to my arguments quietly, now and again reiterating his desire to do nothing contrary to the wishes of the British Government Finally he said he would confiscate the arms from the local dealer, adding that he would serve him with a written notice that he was doing so as he had deliberately infringed his orders, but that he would be glad of the presence of one of the Ao-ency S u a a wben tbe not ’ ce was t0 be served and during the removal of the arms to the Agency. As the Shaikh did not press me for anything in writing, I agreed to assist him by sending one of my clerks. It was arranged therefore That one of my clerks should be present to-morrow morning, when in his presence the Shaikh’s notice would be served on Mullah Abdullah Atiji, and that subsequently the clerk should accompany the Shaikh’s representative and coolies, and be alsc present at the removal to the Agency of all the arms and ammunition received from the French “ sambuk” by Goguyer et Cie’s local Agent. The Shaikh also said he would inform Mullah Abdullah that he would not recognize his agency for the French firm, nor admit any more arms to be landed for him. Having expressed my thanks at the Shaikh’s evident desire to assist His Majesty’s Government in the suppression of the arms traffic, and again assured him of their full support, I took my leave, the Shaikh reiterating his intention of furthering our wishes to the best of his ability 8. The Shaikh’s change of front is curious and difficult to explain, unless it was actuated by the not improbable idea of enhancing the value of his co-opera tion. I urged on the Shaikh the advisability of making his written notice to Mullah Abdullah Atiji (on which he seemed resolved) as brief as posisble, and*of confining it merely to saying that the confiscation was being enforced as punish ment for disregard of a long-standing prohibition of which the culprit was well aware. g. The mail will probably have left before I can report the result of the Shaikh’s proposed action, and though I endeavoured to leave no loop-hole by which he might find a way of escape from his present undertaking, I am rather sceptical of its complete execution. I will report by telegraph, however, what actually results. 10. It is improbable that the Shaikh will expose his own connivance by surrendering any of the arms he may have already taken for himself, and it will therefore be necessary to assume as correct, his figures of the boat’s cargo, but on this point I shall not be able to furnish accurate details until the consignment has been lodged in the Agency. Note of a Conversation with Shaikh Mubarak on 1st May igto. Received Resident’s wire 11 A.m. May 1st, and sent over to Shaikh to say should like to see him at 4-30 P. M, (10-30 Arabic time).6 After usual greetings, ^sked Shaikh about the French “ sambuk Shaikh replied that he had done his best by ordering it out of the port and refusing permission to landing, but that the Maskat b-akhuda head threatened' him with going to Fao and wiring to French Consul. Finally, against his orders, the arms in number of 321 rides, mostly 5. shot magazine Mausers and a lot of ammunition had been landed during the night ot Friday-Saturday (29th-3oth April), and were now in possession of the French firm’s agent, Mullah Muhammad Atiji. The “sambuk” still in harbour and Muhammad Saleh not arrested, but Shaikh intends arresting him. Informed Shaikh of receipt of telegram from Resident and translated first part, to him He demurred saying afraid of the French, so again pointed out promise of British support and urged as a reason that deposit of the arms in the Agency would ensure Shaikh was not subjected to'difficulties with French for the matter would tnen pass to British Government. Shaikh still demurred and asked to be allowed to write officially to me reporting the landing of the arms against his orders and asking for my opinion, and that 1 should reply in an official letter requ esting him to confiscate them and send them to the Agency. 1 made no com ments, but said that letter seemed hardly necessary in view of very plain terms in Resident’s telegram of Government’s assistance. Said he would prefer the letter so as to have something to show any Frenchman who made things unpleasant for him. Talk then drifted to Muhammad Saleh, and Shaikh said he proposed sum moning some of his old men to pronounce on his nationality and if they said Kuwaitihe would imprison him. After various other subjects I left. Most unsatis factory, as convinced Sheikh did not tell me correct number of rifles, and landing was impossible unless covertly connived at by Sheikh. Do not believe he pro poses anything for Muhammad Saleh. Just at leaving, Sheikh brought up old plea that “ sambuk ” could not leave without pilot, and as his proclamation dees not include confiscation or detention of the empty boat, especially when he has not confiscated the arms, 1 reiterated my previous suggestion that boat could engage any of the dozens of other Kuwait pilots. _.. irv .^ 1st May /q fo. W. H. I. SHAKESPEAR. (Confidential) No. C.-23, dated Kuwait, the icth May 1910. From—C aptain W. H. I. SHAKESPEAR, Political Agent, Kuwait, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. 1 have the honour to submit the following report in continuation of my letter No C.-22, dated the 4th May 1910, and in explanation of the two telegrams subsequently sent to you, regarding Shaikh Mubarak’s action in the matter of the arms and ammunition landed from the French sambuk “ Fateh-el-Khair.” * 2 My scepticism as to the Shaikh’s good intentions was not unjustified, for when my clerk presented himself at the Shaikh’s palace as arranged on the morning following the conversation already reported, the Shaikh informed him that he' would not confiscate the arms without “ an order from the Sahib ” I had taken the precaution of furnishing my clerk with written instructions, and on his explanation of these, the Shaikh apparently began to equivocate and distort the arrangements upon which he had agreed with me the day before ; finally he sent Abdullah bin Muhammad Atiji to receive his ordeis direct from me. I returned a message that 1 had no “ orders” for anyone except my own clerk, and that the latter had been sent to the Shaikh in accordance with his request of the previous day. The Shaikh then definite!^ refused to carry out the con fiscation and sent my clerk back to inform me of his decision. On this I went immediately to see the Shaikh. The Shaikh at once began to explain that I must have misunderstood his intentions the day beLre, that it was impossible for him to issue orders for confiscation, etc., etc. I heard the Shaikh out, and then took him over the whole of the ground again carefully, finally translating to him parts of my letter C.-22 in which I had already reported our conveisation to you. In reply to frequent queries whether my report did not truly represent what had actually, passed, the Shaikh invariably replied in the affirmative; I then t ointed cut that, that being the case, I w T as at a loss to explain his changeof attitude to Government, for after all, Government only required his assistance under his old prohibition, while, as I had more than once assured him, they were prepared to give him all support possible in the event of his action being ques tioned by the French. I pointed out that, as I had already informed Government of his readiness to assist, they could not but be surprised at his change of front, and would probably draw unfavourable inferences in spite of his frequent profes sions of friendship. It was impossible for me to confiscate the arms for he was Ruler of Kuwait ; the prohibition stood in his name, and confiscation in his own territory must therefore proceed from him. After various other attempts at subterfuge, the Shaikh finally agreed to, substantially, J.he same procedure as on the previous day, omitting the written notice to Abdullah Atiji. He said he would like to inform him, however, before me, and therefore had him summoned, when after some unimportant preliminary remarks, the Shaikh said to him * ou are my subject and my order is upon you, the Sahib’s man and my man will go together to your house and take the arms landed against my orders ^ . e French ‘ Sambuk ’, and together convey them to the Sahib’s house, and it is my order ” I record these words verbatim as subsequently the Shakh endea voured to assert that the “ order ” was from the British Government. I tried to have the confiscation carried out there and then, but at the Shaikh s request agreed to the following day, and, to give a receipt for the arms and ammunition as soon as received in the Agency. 3. On the following day, the 6th May, my clerk attended at the Shaikh s palace with the same orders as before. He informs me that the Shaikh reiter- ated all his previous equivocation, and finally sent his man to me with Abdullah Atiii to ask whether I was agreeable to granting time in order that the arm^ might be sent back to Maskat. As I had already repeatedly explained to the Shaikh our object in the confiscation, I contented myself with remarking that, seeing the arms had already been in Kuwait some 10 or 11 days, I was not agree able to any further delay. The confiscation was then carried out as ar.anged and the arms brought to the Agency. They consisted of 301 Gras carbines, module 1874, and 30,100 rounds of ammunition for them. I made out a receipt as received from the Shaikh’s man who actually brought them. The Sheikh refused to accept my receipt and sent his man to explain that my receipt must be personally from me to Abdullah Atiji, all mention of the Shaikh s name to be omitted. 4. On hearing the above I went to see the Shaikh again and listened for an hour to another most ingenious and bare-faced attempt by the Shaikh to recon struct our previous conversations and agreements. I was obliged to check further perversion of the truth by pointing out again, that my records could not possibly bear the interpretations the Shaikh now desired to put on his and my words, and seeing that he had himself admitted in my previous interview that my record was accurate I was at a loss to understand his object at this late date in evading the obvious meaning of our words. Finally the Shaikh said he was afraid of the French Government, that he was not a Great Power, and would like in writing from me that the British Government would support him. I said I was perfectly willing to accede to this request, but that a receipt direct from me to Abdullah Atiji was impossible,. and that if he was satisfied, the arms would be forthcoming from my charge but objected to a receipt to his own name for them ; we could dispense with^receipts. The Shaikh said this would suit him better if he had the letter assuring him of British support. Accordingly I destroyed the previous receipt and drafted a letter at once. 3. For the next two days the Shaikh did everything he could to produce the impression that the Political Agent had seized the arms and refused to grant a receipt, and finally sent me a message that, if I did not grant a receipt to Abdullah Atiji as he desired, he would be compelled to furnish him with an ‘ istihad (paoer of witness) as to what he had heard and what had actually passed. I replied that such a receipt was impossible and that I was willing to explain the reasons once more. Accordingly I again visited the Shaikh on the 8th May and listened to another long declamation of what were supposed really to have been&lt; our arrangements, and how the Shaikh was disappointed in my refusal to omit his name from any part in the affair. The Shaikh went so far in what was obviously a prepared attempt to repudiate our conversations, that 1 felt it was necessary to speak in rather plainer terms of his action than I had hitherto used, and took him categorically through the whole of our conversations until he admitted that he had agreed originally to confiscate the arms himself, lodge them in the Agency ; that tne sugg'estion for the presence of one of the Agency Staff had come from him and that, though I had considered it unnecessary, I had acceded to his request. He was so insistent that l should grant a receipt to Abdullah Atiji direct, that I said, as the Shaikh did not appear to accept my reasons for not doing so, I was willing to refer the point to you, but I should be compelled to lay before you also how, from his original prompt readiness to assist Government, the Shaikh had gravitated to endeavouring, by various tortuous and questionable methods to evade his part in the matter, make difficulties where none existed, and all this in spite of an explicit assurance of support and assistance. The Shaikh then shifted his ground and asked if Government’s wishes would be met by his holding the arms in his own custody. I said, as I had intimated at one of our first conversations, that they would under certain conditions flz's:*-*that the arms must not remain with a dealer, they must be kept in some special safe place, kept intact and not allowed to be moved without the consent of the British Government, and that I should be permitted access to them in case of inspection being necessary. The Shaikh agreed to the conditions and said he would store them in his customs-house. The Shaikh’s reversion to this arrangement is curious for as long ago as the 1st May I suggested this course, and he then refused it, saying he preferred the arms should be in the Agency, To prevent any further possible doubts, I repeated the conditions to the Shaikh and informed him that I would send the arms over on receipt of his written undertaking. 6. The following morning the undertaking was handed to me and the arms and ammunition were removed to the Shaikh’s customs-house. The Shaikh de murred at giving me a receipt for them, and as 1 had already recorded the marks, numbers, etc., of the consignment, l did not press the point. Later I was in formed that the arms had been lodged in a separate room in the customs and the room sealed with the Shaikh’s seal. 7. Copies and translations of the documents which passed between the Shaikh and myself are attached hereto. The course of the case has not been quite as satisfactory as I desired, but the Shaikh’s peculiar methods make straight forward dealing difficult ; 1 trust however, that the result will be con sonant with the wishes of Government ; I have succeeded in maintaining that the confiscation was carried out by the Shaikh in virtue of his prohibition, the arms are now under his custody in one of his public buildings, and we hold his written undertaking that they shall not be removed without the consent of the British Government. 8. My report has run to an inordinate length, but in the circumstances of the case it appeared advisable to have the facts on record in some detail, for my personal opinion is that some stronger form of persuasion will be required, if Government desire the Shaikh to confiscate any further consignments. Instructions for Head-clerk. Head-clerk— With reference to what I told you verbally, here are your instructions :— 1. The Shaikh is going to confiscate the arms, ammunition, etc., landed from the French “ Sambuk” last Friday against his orders and prohibition. The consignment is with Abdullah Atiji. 2. The Shaikh desires an Agency representative present when he has Abdullah Atiji served with a written notice to above effect. 3, The Shaikh desires an Agency representative to accompany his men when the arms are formally confiscated and brought from Abdullah Atiji’s premises for safe lodgment in the Agency. 4. You will be the Agency representative, simply to watch proceedings and ta^e charge of the arms, ammunition, etc., when being taken to the Agency. m • *9 4 • * 5^ If'desired you should note numbers, marks, etc., of cases or weapons, but in conjunction with the Shaikh’s men. Any receipt required will be given by me when the arms arrive at the Agency. 6. Attend at the Shaikh’s palace at 2 hours after sunrise (little earlier will be better). W. H. I.

The British Government is obliged to Your Excellency for your wish to help the British Government in the prohibition of the traffic in arms in the Persian Gulf, and because of the disobedience of the Nakhuda to your special order of prohibi tion from landing the arms from his vessel in Kuwait, I am willing that the arms be deposited in my house for safe custody and I say that the British Govern ment will help Your Excellency in your laudable efforts in the prohibition of the traffic in arms in the Persian Gulf. And this is what was necessary, and may you be preserved.

From—Captain Shakespear, Fao, To—The Resident in Bushire. “ Sambuk ” with arms from Maskat with regular French papers and flag arrived Wednesday and errant Nakhuda Muhammad Saleh aboard. Shaikh asked my advice, so suggested he should apprehend Muhammad Saleh on grounds which he already asked his extradition from Maskat vide previous demi-official to Trevor. Suggested boat be informed Shaikh already prohibited import arms by notification May 1900 and recent letters to Maskat and therefore better return Maskat with cargo or proceed Basrah as intimated in her papers. Shaikh anxious for advice not to compromise himself so trust you can send general instructions by mail 4th, May. Full written report reaches you fast mail Monday. Telegram, dated 29th April 1910. From— Lieutenant-Colonel P. Z. Cox, C.S.I., C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To— Captain Shakespear, Fao, Political Agent, Kuwait. Your telegram of 28th April from Fao. If the arms were wrongfully landed in Kuwait territory in contravention of the Shaikh’s prohibition, you are nauthorised to urge Shaikh Mubarak to seize them and deliver them for the time being to your custody. Under such circumstances, His Majesty’s Government undertake to support the Shaikh in the event of any unpleasantness with the French and will be prepared to consider the expediency of paying the Shaikh compensation for their value, or of handing the arms over to him, after a time when there is no risk of their passing back into the hands of dealers. Should Shaikh object to hand them to you as Government suggest, you might make some effective arrangement with him, under which he will deposit them in some special place to which he will allow you friendly access, and will give you written undertaking not to let them go out of such custody, except in agreement with you, the object being to prevent their getting back to dealers. Supposing the arms were not landed, I advise action as follows :—Presumably the arms were not manifested. Should the Nakhuda allege that the consignment was for Turkish territory, Shaikh would explain that he believed import of arms into Turkey was ordinarily prohibited, and that the circumstances of this case were sufficiently suspicious to oblige him to detain the dhow and arms, pending production by the Nakhuda of a permit from the VVali of Basrah to import them. Should arms not have been fraudulently landed and should Nakhuda admit or should there be evidence to prove that the consignment was for some Persian or Arab port, covered by existing prohibitions, arms and dhow should be detained pending further telegraphic reference to me as to disposal. Shaikh should take any action he sees fit in regard to the treatment of Nakhuda Muhammad Saleh. In any case report action finally taken by wire. Telegram, dated 23rd May 1910. From— Captain Shakespear, Political Agent, Kuwait, To—The Resident, Bushire. Your telegram 29th April. Interviewed Shaikh Sunday, and found arms been landed dunng Friday—Saturday night, and delivery taken by Goguyer’s local Agent, a Kuwaiti. Shaikh avers this done contravention of his express orders, but from independent source hear that accepted 120 rifles for himself and only usual duty levied. Landing against Shaikh’s orders if real, would be impossible. Urged Shaikh therefore in sense first part only of your tele gram, but he pretends much anxiety from Maskat Nakhuda’s threats of reporting to French Consul. Said he would write officially to me and like official reply requesting him to confiscate arms and lodge them in the Agency. No letter yet received 3 P.M. Monday and do not think Shaikh intends running straight. Presume your telegram does not authorise official letter of description suggested, but if Shaikh addresses me, 1 could frame answer saying in view of Shaikh’s manifest intention to assist Government, and his old proclamation, am walling to receive arms in Agency for safe custody, and assure Shaikh of British Government’s support in laudable endeavour to suppress traffic. If you approve please wire as man will await answer at Fao. Consignment was 400 rifles and unknown amount ammunition evidently trial trip. Shaikh said he would apprehend Muhammad Saleh but consider even this doubtful. Telegram No. 441, dated the 3rd May 1910. From-LlEUTENANT-COLONEL P. Z. Cox, C.S I., C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To— Captain W. H. I. Shakespear, Political Agent, Kuwait. . Your 223-3. This consignment having according to the Shaikh's personal intimation to you, been illicitly imported in contravention of his prohibition, and in defiance of his orders, it is clearly most important to himself and to us in the interests of the suppression of the traffic, that he should vigorously enforce his prohibition by such action as will deter others. Sound Shaikh first as to whether on the strength of a letter to you on the terms you suggest, he is ready to confiscate the arms and let you have temporary custody of them. If so, well and good. If not, then in order to ensure confiscation and custody, there is noobjection to your informing him in writing, that you are authorised to assure him, that His Majesty's Government will support him in the event of any unpleasant- ness arising with the French, as the result of his enforcing his prohibition in this and other such cases. Make sure that he understands the reason for our want ing temporary custody of the arms and inform him also, in writing, if necessary, that we will^ hand them back to him later on, or give him reasonable compensa- f. 1 .? 0 . * or &gt; l ; ^ em destroyed. As Shaikh has already informed you that arms were illicitly imported, it seems late in the day for him to write you an official letter to that effect, but if he still wants to do so, please see that it is suitably worded. Telegram, dated the gth May 1910. From— Captain W. H, I. Shakespear, Political Agent, Kuwait, To—Resident, Bushire. Confidential. Continuation of my letter C.-22. Have received 301 Gras carbines and 30,100 cartridges in Agency on 6th May. Shaikh issued no written notice to Abdullah Atiji and wanted me give the man receipt direct omitting all mention of Shaikh. I disagreed as confiscation by Shaikh and not by me. After much talk, Shaikh having refused receipt to him, desired and accepted a letter from me in term suggested in my telegram 223-3 so trust matter practically settled now for present, though Shaikh uses every opportunity of producing impression that confiscation is by British Government and not by him. Shaikh also endeavouring to get himself outside affair in every possible way. Telegram, dated the 12th May 1910. From— Captain W. H. I. Shakespear, Political Agent, Kuwait, To—Resident, Bushire. My last telegram little previous as Shaikh, having spent three days trying every method of evading his part ia affair even to reconstructing our conversation, finally said he would like custody of the arms. He refused this course at the beginning but as he now seemed willing and was ready to give me the necessary written undertaking for their non-removal without British consent, I complied and have returned him whole consignment on 9th May. It is now lodged in customs house under guard and I hold Shaikh’s written undertaking. G. C. B. P., Simla.—No. €1379 F.

ARMS TRAFFIC (15th March) _ CONFIDENTIAL Section 1. ( 8921) Foreign Office to India Office. \ ' Confident al Foreign Office Sir, 15th March 1910. With reference to your letters of the 17th , 2 l 5 t , ?A%C February last and to the letter from the Admiralty ad- -dressed to ycu on the 21 st ultimo , respecting the arm^ traffic in the Persian GT*lf # I am directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to state, for the 'nfermatien of the Secretary of State for India , that he has taken the various queStloAuf raised therein Into his careful consideration. Th, main points whioa n &lt; n the Foreign Offioe aro:- 1. The positir/n of a dhow und^ . the French flag in Per^iaH- and Maskat territorial waters and the power - of the Per- -sian or Maskat Government to restrain suc^, vessel from carrying on a traffic in arms. 2. The ability of His Majesty’s Government to support the Sheikhs of Kowcit, Bahrein, and Mohammeaah , and the Trucial Chiefs in any difficulty that may arise with the „ French Government , in consequence of seizures of cargoes of arm effected under th&lt;, a th&lt; ritj of thc$ in their territorial waters. 3. The possibility of referring the attitude of France in Maskat to the Hague for arbitration, anij/in connection with this the question of arbitration on the re-export of arms from Jibuti. Sir E. Grey’s opinion on those points may be expressed as fol ows: - 1. The reported action of M.Goguyor’s agent in purchasing a dhow , and registering it at the French Cons-^lato in Mas- -kat under the French flag, would seem , »nder present cn- -ditions, tc provide the 0 u r n arm. with a vessel that' is expempt from search or seizure by His Majesty,s ships.r The question h-in ?3 primarily on the powers of the Piy^kian or M askat Governments to exorcise restraint on a dhow and secondarily on the extent of the mandate to exercise restraint on their behalf , respecting which Persia or Maskat may be able to accord to 'ireat Britain, Prance 3 ike u ri itain posses cs fell ex t^__ : . jurisdiction in Persia (and holds a similar position in Maskat, so that that the same consideration holds good for both countries) and Persia has parted to France with her jurisdiction over French citizens , and cannot derogate from her own grant by conferring o «.at Britain any jur*- -isdiction or power to interfere with French dhows in Per- • a., tc l .orial waters* Sir E, Grey therefore agr c with the view expros cd in your letter of the 24th ultimo that the Sadr -i-Azam^s letter of the t 8 ih December 1897 does n t authorise the search by British puhlio ships in P&lt; rsian waters of any dh w , , ; j t 't : vo of thv arac- -ter ari^iatisna. ity. The r : ght ac o.de ^iy the Persian Government only extends to Persian, British, and M^akat ves els. On the other hand , th*. Persian Governmett has not part ied , and* cannot part , with its right to prevent a contra- «band trade within its own territorial watc^rs, ev^n if carried on under the f]ag of France , or any other nation enjoying ex-territoriality , France is bound to'see that the sustoms and other general laws for the internal govern— -ment of Persia are not violated with impunnity by French citizens , and either to allow breaches of ouch . aws to be lohod in the Shah’s urts or by the Shah’s auth&lt; ritie# or to provide effective means for punishing or restraining French citizens from acting illegally , by means of the local Prench tribunals and authorities. Sir E. Grey does not pos ess any precise information as to the procedure in Persia in cases of smuggling offences by French citizens , b:.t assuming that France does not provide suitable and offiddent means for restraining hercitizen- from committing t&gt;rc&lt;i,ches of the Persian Customs it would be certainly open to ffative/ the Persian Government to protest against the insufficient and even unfriendly action of Prance in this respect, thoagh w. .ethr- -cr , in fact, Persia won: d adopt ,hls at itadc with rt strong outside pros uro may be con-idered to bo doubtful* f The Persian Government have of course a perfect right to take ac Ivc ptepentive measures in their territorial Waters or on Persian ter Itory to stop the importation of arms by dhows under the French fi^g , but in practice this would be beyond their ..naided powers to effect, and they might therefore confer on British ^ava. officers powers to act for this purpose in the name of and as the servants of tht s^hah* But .hough technical y s ch an arrangemnet might be held to be valid , it is unnecessary to point out the vejy st-rio s friction that would at once ensue with Prance, nor would It be easy to o, , ose a French claim tha Wi c h d in the case of dh we ,n u r the French flag , be accorded to French and not to British officials. 2. Sir B. Grey „ndorstands that France has no spec- - ial rights in Kowe.it, Bahrein, Mohami erah or on tht Trn- -cia. coast and he therefore is of opinion that the line of action proposed in paragraph 2 of your . etter of tho 24th ultimo, in regadd to tiu rulers of this district , shf/U. d be adopted* 3. Sir E. Grey entirely agrees with the view expressed in y ur let ter fl of the 21 st ultimo , that the cases of Jibuti and Maskat should be treated serara4£Ly in any ref©r— -once to arbitration * With regard to Jibuti , he is not, as at reseat advised , .satisfied that the -aso is either strong enough to call the French Government to the Hague, or even if it were submitted to arbitration with/ the re- t .ha- a decision wa given n favour of His Majestyts Government that this result would be commensurate with thewith the friction d,n&lt;i expense involved. In regard to M&amp;skat f I am, in the first place , to o&gt;- -servo that if it can be held that the Sxi. tan is free to prohibit the import of arms into his country. Sir E* G-rey would advocate the course of introducing se' in original inducing?) H4s Highness to take action to thio end, and leaving it to the Procnh Government to summon him or bis Majesty *3 Government to arbitration, since the practical effect on the armr traffic would be greater fend mo ^ immed— -late ; and if the case itself rnty’s Government strong enough taken |n accordance with their also be justified , unless and -tion pronounced against them. In the present instance, ho%ever, an examination of the arguments advanced in your letter last referred to does not convince Sir E. Grey that they would hold good in an international court. Taking these arguments in the order in which they arc placed nn your letter. Sir E. Grey is of opinion with regard tot — i. That to hold that the arms traffic did not exist in 1844 and cannot therefore reasonably x- hold to bo covered by the treaty of that year would if maintained , result in cutting out of the benefits and a plications of the treaty alb . .be , h vK : n exist in 1844 , and commerce in anything that has been invented or discovered since that time. is considered by His M*jeefr~ for arbitration, action view of the case would until the iourt tff arbitra- 2. Sir E. Grey believes that the view which on the whole find-, favour with international jurists at the re ent day is that a Cci . ial treaty whish contains no provision- tot termination or / mlnmEbm by one without the consent of the other. Sir E. Grey is noe prepared to maintain that this is without doubt a correct interpretatioryof international .lav/ , but it is clear that if it is the general view th&lt;. probablitics are that it would be Xtphold by a c^urt of arbitration— In the c* c of a perpetual treaty of which the subg^^t matter had entirely disappeared , so that there '«vas noth- -in^ left to which the provisions of the treaty could ap~ c &gt; -ply it would y!&gt; cx neces itate rei lapse or ‘become ex- -tin^nished • So also If the conditions environing the subject-matter had become so absolutely changed that the treaty in no respect -overcd the ground on which the par -ties originally contracted , or the natural developement and modl^ivaticns of that ground which the lapse of yea.rs had wrought with it, it might be then argued that nothing remained of the original subject matter, contem Oatcd by the parties for the treaty to oprato upon. It is in the present case no doubt to seme extent a question of the degrees to which the original conditions have been altered, but it would be difficu. t to arg.»o tha^ they have becn altered to such a degree as to justify one party in withdrawing from the treaty against the wishes o f the o the r, .it could be succes fully shown that the growth of the arms traf ic at Maokat was a real scusee of danger to that State , involving her in internal disorder or em broiling her with neighbouring to~ritori.es where the im- -port of arms is forbidden it would then be lawful for the Sultan , acting on the maxim 'Sains roipublicae suprema lex' to override the provisions of the ^844 treaty with France in this respect , and to prohibit the arms trade in his dominion's • But ouch a proceeding must be absolutely bona-fide and the result of the conviction of the Govern -ment of Maskat, and if it should in any way appear to be in reality due to -.he initiative of an outside Power, and the pretext alleged sc m to be merely specious, it would be open to criticism , and France would have a right to protest, 4. Although it is true that all the Powers represent-' -ed at the recent Arms Conference, with the exception ofof France, were prepared to ejive ■ a i3 Ma.iesty*s GoVv rnme’nt a free hand to deal with the arms traffic in the Persian Gulf, none of those Powers raised any question a^ to the legal right of the French Government to maintain their attitude , nor did the various delegates give expression to any views which might seem to condemn France from a mora. standpoint. The general attitude was rather one of the recognition cf'the inconvenience of the traf ic to His Majesty^s Gvernment and of the readiness not to hamper a fcl ow civilised Power in defending itself against war -like and savage neighbours, blit here wai no condenma- -ticn of French action as in any way derogating from the recognised standards of modern civilization. For thi&gt; roa -son and also on general grounds. Sir E, Grey is inclined to think that it woTild be dif iciilt fc represent to France that Maskat-- a State of low civilization— was aboi.t to den ..nee the treaty because the conduct of french oitisens as arproved of^dr at least unrestrained by^ the french ! ..v• nmt • t wa contrary . ■ ondl / itc I etrine of oihllo law and to //ritlnaie'/ the view universally held with regard to morals, which io in Sir E, Grey’s opinion the practical form in wh : ch the fourth argument mentioned in yc .r lot- -tor would hav^ to be a &gt;p. ied. In vie v therefore of the considerations advanced above and of the many practical difficulties in the way of action— in the Persian Gulf without the consent of Franco, Sir E, Grey would suggest that the French Government might first bo approached direct on the subject. The negotiations attempted hitherto have^ it is truo / re el ted in failure and Sir E, Grey would not propose to renew at present any of- -fers of conoes ions of territory or other compensation; but the situation in Moroc o presents a clOoc analogy to the position on the No.th~w .et ffr ntior of ^ndia ^nd it will be dificult for the French Government to refuse to rv cognise the right of His Majesty’s Government to ask forthe Sdme friendly treatment in the Persian Giilf t have as-orded to Prance in Moroccan waters. I am accordingly to transmit to you herewith a draft memorandum to the French Government which has been prepar-' -ed in this department , and I am to state that Sir E.

Thss traffic first forced itself on the attention of H. r Majesty’s Government during the Afghan War of 1879-188V A and steps were taken to prevent consignments of arms and ammunition of war reaching the Persian Gulf from Indian Ports while in ’381 the Persian Gcvornmvnt realisingJO*— /At the roTia poo .tbilty of the trade a^ regards the ir own country 9 made th, importation of arm^ and am; im Ition into Persia illegal • in the fol owing decade thv trade grow , though not to u_ any very appre|tciable extent, the pricipal merchants boxng a Persian-Armenian firm and a Parsi-British house , bi.t Vlk- the first great impetus to thv traf ic came through the Brussels Act of 2nd Jv;ly 1890 which put a stop to the Afri — -can slave trade and thereby checked the ancillary trade in aims on hto East coa^t of Africa, which ad flourished greatly while slavery existed. The manufacturers and exporters of arms were driven this to find another o.it3et for their goods , and it was n ^ long before they found their market in the Persian Gulf. Investigations made by the Govtrnm nt of India showed that these arms were not yet penetrating beyond South / his- -tan /the local demand probably absorbing the supply / a • * fact the significance of which was not lost on oith — -or the P&lt; r$ian nment or the SuXtan of Maskat* s ince the former In 1891 reiterated the Shah f s edict of 1881 in stringent terms and the latter issued a proclamation a^ fol:owst- tf Let it bo known by this writing that we have forbidden 11 the import into our territory of Gwadxir and its de pens'on ^ ^sx^ch as Pishkan -cios* of arms and ammunition; nothing of the kind is to be 1 ^l:&gt; th^ re or taken thence to any place whatever • Take heed of this , nd anyone ** transgressing this probibition wol b&lt; iable to punishment; Written and promulgated this 21st Rajab 1308 — 3rd March 1891. tf Until 1890 the greater part of the arms reached the Persian Gulf from Zanzibar, but at this time direct ship \ -ments from Europe began ,not only to Ma bat but A _ iabt_ ports where the trad*, grew and flourished in spite of the Shah’s prohibition • The quality too, of thu arms change^and breeoh loaders and rop^atin^ rifles took the j aco of muzzle-loaders and cap-gun 8 * which were no longt lz- in Arabia or Persia • At the c. ose of 1896 the volume of trade was so ejreat that the Government of India were again led to investigate the ■ultimate destination of the quantities of military mat- serial pouring Into the Gulf, m d it was found that 25 o/o of the arms were absorbed by the Turkish posucs iono in the Gulf, 1 f&gt; o/o by non-Turkish Arabia and 60 o/o disappear ■-i Into Per la being dc -patched from Maekat thtough bandar Abbas to unkown ulterior destinations. The Persian Government wore thoroughly alarmed at the dimensions which the traffic had reached in their territor^- - r cs in spite of the Shah’s proclamation of 1881 and cn 1 th December 1897 , they anounced that orders had been given for ^tore^ of ^rms &amp;C to bo confiscated and four days lalor they agreed that al mercantile vessels trading in the Gulf under the Persian Plag might be searched for arme and ammunition bjr British men-of-war,( on the- condi- B -tion that any contraband that was found shorn, d be seized and hande■ over to the Persian authorities.) The Persian Government also as ociatod themselves with the British Government in requesting the Sultun of Maskat to warn his subjects of the illegality of the export of arms to Persia and to authorise British war-vessels to search British , Persian and Maskat vessels in his terri- -torial waters and to seize and confiscate any cargoes of arms owned by British , Persian and Miskat /hips subjects found on board if destined for illicit importation into Pc sia • The Sultan of Maskat agreed to this req'u st and issued a notification and proolmmstion in the sense reauir- -ed on the 13th January 1898. The res:., t of these measures was that between December 1897 and March 1898 some 5,239 rifles and 1,241,253 rounds of ammuniticn were -ie z« d at Ln.^hlre alone, while at McbskiZ^M&amp;skat a British steamer Gomi^ from Europe was stop'&gt;odl on A. 24th °angary 1 898 , by fter ^kjesiyjts ship !, Lapwin? ff and re- -Icivod of 7,850 rifles and 700,000 rounds of amm/'Xinition^ Tii csc soizarci joined with tho independent o// action of the She ikh of Bahrein, who in ^annary 1098 attached a stock of 2667 rifles and 637,500 cartridges bel^gnor.g to a Parsi tirm cstabJ ished there, for the moment para, yzod the arms trade.

As a consequence of Mons Goguyor’s activity , the arms traffic recovered from th^ cheCk it hid suffered in 1898 and in the year 1904-05 the number of rifles imported into Maskat was computed at not less than 20,000 although by that time tht s... ton of Maskat h^d extended the ; rohibitio/c- Q: export of a^ms and amnnition fr^om his territories to the Afr ican ^oa^t and i^jands tinder British protection jA north of Cape Guardafui and to Italian p 0 s- -sca ion &gt; on the ea-&gt;t coast of Africa, and hat given Briti- ish ani Italian ^hips^of^war power to search tod Maskat vessels on the high seas and in Maskat territorial waters ( any arms fecund being sonfiscatod to lf : H - i K ) (Notifiation dated the 17th October 1903 ) ; although tfcc Trucial Chiefs had prohibited the Import and export of arms in their territories -Notificationsif 24th , 25th, 26th NokNov 1902) ; aJ though the Sheikhs of Bahrein and Kowolt h(i2. prohlbtod the traffic in their countries and empowered British and Persian ships of war to search Bahrein and Koweit v&lt; Is in British, Persian /Bahrein and Koweit territorial waters respectively 30th April 1098 and 24^ May 1900), a-though in fact throughout the whole . ittor' -al of the Persian Gulf— with the exception of El Katr r—as well as thr 'u^hout India and th&lt;coast of Afrivea aa fas as Jibutil^traffic in arms was illt^a. and contrabancU It is unnoces ary for the purpo es of this Memarand;.m, to trace the general growth of the arms traffic in the Per-»■ -sian Gulf itself from this time-*- 1005 — to tlu. present day , but its most striking devolopcmcnt mu t be briefly alluded to since it is a matter of a very ?raee concern to HI Maje 5 ty ? s Government* Already in 1898 evidence had been received by Hio ^ajes^ - ty * s Government which showed that arms &amp;c, had filtered through from the Persian Gulf by way of Afghanistan to the Ghilzai tribes in Kurram on the North West frontier of India , and by 1901 there was clear proof that Arms and * ammunition from the *« . ian GxlI f were arriving in la ies in Waz iris tan , so much so that the British Pol- -itical Officer of Southern Waziristan reported that he could buy locally the cartridygi of a notorious firm of Gulf arms traders at the rate of 5000 a week. The Indo-Af- -ghan trade on the frontier grow graduaJly oince the in- ttervening marJOtts absorbed a large number of the rifles &amp;c offered for sale, but aythoSe markets became glutted it increased proportionately and a new trade route was dev— -eloped.

Sheikh Mubarek’s action in regard to the dhow now said to hava arrived at Koweit with arms will be reported in due course. No C.—37, dated Koweifc, the 15th June 1910 (Confidential). From— Captain W. H. I. Shakespear, Political Agent, Koweit, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. With regard to recent correspondence concerning the arms traffic in Koweit, I have the honour to invite a reference to the items relating to this subject in my diary for this week. 2. As regards M. Elbaz’s (alias Ibrahim) visit to Koweit, the Sheikh informed me that he had come to treat concerning the arms and ammunition confiscated from the Erench sambuk. Elbaz first asked for their restitution, which the Sheikh refused ; he then asked that, if the Sheikh desired to keep them, he should be paid for them. This also the Sheikh refused, pointing out that the arms and ammunition had been confiscated in virtue of his old proclamation, of which and of his recent orders to his agents in Maskat Elbaz must be as well aware as others. Elbaz then enquired if the Sheikh would be willing to return the arms if he succeeded in inducing either of the Political Agents at Maskat or Koweit or the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to ask the Sheikh to restore them, or if he preferred a request officially through the Erench Consulate either direct to the Sheikh or through the British authorities. The Sheikh informed me that he met all these alternatives with the reply that the confiscation was in virtue of his owm proclamation and carried out in his own town, and that, even if the British officials asked him to restore the arms (which he considered most improbable), he could not see his way to agreeing, for the matter was one which concerned his own internal affairs in which no foreign Government had any right of interference. I asked the Sheikh whether he thought there could be any ulterior object in Elbaz making these propositions ; he said Jbe did not know, hut that he had made it clear to him that the arms had been confiscated by himself as an act of State and that he was not prepared to hand them over at any outsider’s bidding. 3. I was somewhat surprised at the change to the very firm attitude the Sheikh now assumes, and it is possible it may have been prompted by a desire to make it clear to us that he intends to retain the confiscated arms for himself. His attitude is correct enough according to the notification under which the seizure was made, for though the English translation gives “ seized and confis cated ” the original Arabic adds the words “ batarik beit al mal ”, which undoubtedly means “ for the Sheikh’s own State treasury ”, and the Sheikh may he under an apprehension that we may subsequently make a demand for the arms ourselves. The Sheikh informed me that, so far as Elbaz was concerned, he had given him a direct answer that he should not surrender the arms either to him or to his agent. The Sheikh added that he had taxed Elbaz in his agent’s presence with spreading rumours that an exchange had been made in the arms confis cated and that those shipped in the sambuk had really been magazine rifles. The Sheikh assured me that he held a document from the Koweit Agent, Abdulla Atiji, saying that the arms received from the sambuk were really Gras carbines, that he showed this to Elbaz, and that Elbaz had admitted such to be the case. 4. On the other hand, from an outside source, I hear that Elbaz is also here for the purpose of collecting . some Rs. 13,000 to Rs. 15,000 from the Sheikh, due on arms previously purchased by him from Goguyer’s firm. 6. The Sheikh left Koweit before the arrival of the large buggalow reported in my diary as said to contain some 3,000 rifles, and it remains to beI ; y \ v \V seen what action will be taken in regard to them. I have not broached the subject to Sheikh Salim, who is representing his father, for he would have no power to issue any definite order of seizure in the Sueikh’s absence, and a display of interest in the buggalow’s cargo on my part now would have the effect of warning all concerned. As soon as the Sheikh returns, I shall take the first opportunity of mentioning the subject if he does not himself inform me. (&gt;, I told the Sheikh that I should report his conversation to you in order that you might be informed of all the facts, should any request for restitution be made for the seized arms either by Elhaz himself or through the French Consulate at Maskat. °No. 1774, dated Bushire, the 3 rd (received 13th) July 1910 (Confidential). t From— -Lieutenant-Colonel P.

With reference to paragraph 2 of my letter* No. 1670, dated 22nd June 1910, I have the honour to submit a copy (1) KowcTt 0 Wafy entry, dated the uth June 1910. of a communication received from ( 2 ) Koweit Agency No. c.-3y, dated tb* 2iit Captain Shakespear from which it will be June iyio. geen ghgjkk Mubarek denies that the Koweit dhow referred to (and another) brought back cargoes of arms as reported to the Political Agent. 2. I am sending details to the Political Agent, Maskat, and Senior Naval Officer, for information and enquiry. Extract from the diary of the Political Agent, Koweit. 14th June .—A buggalow arrived late yesterday evening from Maskat, and it is said she has on board her about 3,000 rifles and ammunition. They belong to Abdulla-bin-Atiji and others and were shipped by the firm of Messrs. Goguyer of Maskat. It is just possible that the firearms were shipped, while M. Elbaz was in Maskat and that his present visit to Koweit was timed to watch developments regarding this consignment. The buggalow on her arrival anchored opposite the Sheikh’s Customs House, but the next morning moved on to Bunder Shweikh. The firearms are said not to have been landed yet, probably due to the Sheikh’s absence. She belongs to one Shahin-bin-Ghanim, and in returning from the Malabar coast visited Maskat. Besides the firearms, she has other cargo on board. No. C.—39, dated Koweit, the 21st June 1910 (Confidential). From— Captain W. H. I. Shakespear, Political Agent, Koweit, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. With reference to paragraph 5 of my letterf No. C.—37, dated the 15th June 1910, later reports described the t EmIo. to Serial No. 106 . i ar g e buggalow as bringing 1,700 rifles and not 3,000 as was first reported. 2. This is one of the large buggalows trading with the Malabar coast, and it is said that, when calling at Maskat on her homeward voyage, she picked up the 1,700 rifles and sailed for Lingah, and that she was held up by a British man-of-war, but escaped search by showing false papers. Her name is given as “ Amhar Towil ”, and her nakhuda is one Khalifa-bin-Shahin, the son of the owner. I also heard that another of these large buggalows had brought 500 rifles. 3. Both these vessels arrived during the Sheikh’s absence, which made it necessary to defer action pending his return. On his return as the Sheikh made no move, I enquired whether he knew of the arrival of these two buggalows and of the reports current about them, and to make it quite clear, I related what I had heard. The Sheikh said he had heard the rumour as regards ’Shahin-bin-Ghanim’s boat and immediately on the Nakhuda’s arrival had taken steps to discover the truth. He found the rumour groundless and thought besides Shahin was not such a fool as to risk practi cally all he had in the world (the buggalow and her cargo) for a precarious profit in carrying contraband arms. Of the other buggalow he had not heard, but he was sure it could not be true, for he would certainly have been informed of any attempt at smuggling. 4. I think myself that it is fairly certain that these buggalows have brought arms in spite of the Sheikh’s denial, but as proof in Koweit is almost impossible through fear of the Sheikh, I am compelled to accept his word unless indeed unmistakable evidence can be adduced of purchase or shipment at Maskat. 5. I believe false papers are frequently carried by dhows as well as their true ones, and if the story I have heard here of the “ Ambar Towil s escape from search is at all in accordance with facts, it would appear that a v cry strict search is required of all dhows.To ho. of 1910♦ British Kesidoncy andCpnaiilate-cieneral, Bushire, August 1910 The Political Agent, Aowait.

T * m X f lx • i xi June 1910, regarding the seizure by the Shaikh of Kuwait of the arms and ammunition landed in April last from the French dhow “ Fateh-al-Khair”. 2. During a conversation a few days ago the Shaikh enquired whether he might now issue the arms to his own followers, as they had been under guard for eight months and there had been no further proceedings in regard to them. I replied that I would be glad if he would await the receipt of a reply to a reference which I would make to you on the subject by this mail. 3. Under the terms of his Notification of May 1900 the Shaikh is entitled to the proceeds of all such confiscations, and though he made difficulties at the time, the confiscation was actually carried out legally under that proclamation. The owner of the arms, Goguyer et Cie, after an attempt to recover his loss has apparently abandoned the arms and the French Government have not, so far as I am aware, made any representations in the matter. There would seem, therefore, to be no objection in permitting the Shaikh to make use of the consignment. 4. Though the Shaikh has lately imported a large number of arms for his followers and fighting men, and should therefore not be in need of the confis cated weapons, 1 believe the real reason of his present request is that the con fiscated consignment consisting of inferior and cheap weapons he would prefer to distribute them before making inroads on the new stock of more valuable and costly arms lately received. 5. If there is no other objection to the Shaikh’s distributing these arms, I would solicit the favour of an early reply authorising me to intimate to him that he may take into use the confiscated property. /61 No. 58, dated Bushire, the 7th (received 17th) January 1911 (Confidential).

No. C. —79, dated Kuwait, the 20th December 1910 (Confidential). From Captain W. H. I. Shakespear, Political Agent, Kuwait, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to submit the following information which I have obtained irom various sources as to the present course of the arms traffic in the Persian Gulf. 2. Since Ilis Majesty’s Ships have practically closed the traffic by sea from Maskat to the ports on the Baluchistan and Persian coasts, it appears that enterpristing dealers have evolved another means of exit. One method is to load up camels with arms and ammunition at Muttra and send them overland to the Pirate coast, where from ports, such as Abu Thabi, Shargah and Debai &amp;c., the arms are shipped by native craft to the Persian littoral and to Katar! I am told that there is a continual stream of caravans between Debai and the hinterland of Maskat conveying rice from the former place, that formerly these caravans had to make the journey one way without loads, but that now they profit by carrying arms to the Pirate Coast and return with rice. Another method and that employed from the Batineh Coast ports such as Sohar, Shinas &amp;c., is tor several boats to sail together, only one of which will be carrying contraband whilst the others reconnoitre for His Majesty’s Ships. As soon as a war-vessel is sighted the boat with arms at once takes shelter m one of the numerous deep bays, whilst the others begin fishing until the opportunity offers of proceeding further north. The same method is resorted to as often as a vessel is sighted until the boat with the arms has succeeded in workin&lt;» her way far enough round Musandim Peninsula to have a fairly clear run for a Persian port west of Lingah or the Katar coast. 3. hi cm what I hear in Kuwait it seems that the Katar coast is now the principal distributing centre for arms, certainly for Arabia and largely for the Persian ports also. I am told that the firm of Goguyer et Cie lias a depdt in Katar (presumably at Doha or Wakra) at which two large boat-loads of arms and ammunition were recently landed with an Arab Agent in charge. These boats, secure from molestation by flying French colours, carried very heavy cargoes of arms. J That there is some truth in the report is evidenced by recent information that a caravan conveying 400 rifles with their usual proportion of ammunition from Katar to Iliadh for Bin Saud was waylaid by the Al-Morrah Bedouin and looted of the entire consignment. 4. I cannot well check this information in Kuwait, but have heard substantially the same details from several persons and perhaps the Political Agents at Bahrain and Maskat maybe able to corroborate; lam therefore sending copies of this letter direct to those officers.Telephonic l.'eeeage* From Resident, Bushire. 10 Captain Shakespear, * Political Agent, Koweit, + I Dated 5th April 1911.

Cox, C.S.I., C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to forward, for the information of the Government of „ , , , , T India, a copy of a letter received from the rohtical Agent, Kuwait, in which he voices a report, persistently current in Kuwait, to the effect that Doha and Wakra, in Katar, are now regular arms depots. 2 . Experience has taught me to treat with reserve the reports emanating from vhe bazaar of one Gulf port regarding the ill-behaviour of another, but in this case we have a good deal of circumstantial evidence in corroboration. • Fide correspondence ending with Foreign Department endorsementf No 987 E.-A., dated the 26th May 1911. f Serial No. 167, Part VHI. Firstly, the evident attention being paid of late by Goguyer and the Maskat gang to Katar, instanced by the case of the dhow “ Fateh-el-Khair ”* and, secondly, by repeated reports reaching me from the Customs authorities and others here regarding the present brisk ness of the arms smuggling industry in the Tangistan ports. This accumula tive evidence leads me to think that Captain Shakespear’s information is probably well founded. It will be seen from paragraph 15 of the Naval Commander-in-Chief’s letter]: No. 102—1462 XIV-K., dated j Senai No. 163, i an vm. 10 th May, to the Government of India, that reports in a similar sense have also been reaching His Excellency. 3. The general question of our relations with the Porte in regard to various problems affecting both Powers in the Gulf region, including the status of Katar, has been so specifically “ sub judice ” lately that I have hesitated to put forward any new suggestions in regard to items affected, but the present reports inevitably direct lively attention to the two weak links in the chain of arms prohibitions, represented by the Katar Peninsula and the un-earmarked coast-line south of Ojair, to which Bin Saood has access. 4. If there is no likelihood of our arriving in the near future at a give- and-take adjustments of interests with the Porte, 1 am inclined to think it might be possible, without introducing any political questions at all or involving the Katar family in difficulties with the Turks, to get them, in return for a small subsidy, to notify to their dependents and the public, a prohibition against the import of arms by sea, and to undertake, in case of the supply of their own re quirements, to import only in communication with our representative at Bahrain. The prohibition might not, it is true, be rigidly enforced by the Katar Shaikh, but the mere fact of its existence would eliminate one of the present loopholes, of which Messrs. Goguyer and others are now seeking to take advantage; for all arms under export to the Katar coast wmuld then be con traband. 5. I do not forget that we should still be left with the one remaining weak link—the strip of coast south of Ojair, to which Bin Saood has access— but, assuming the political impracticability at present of asking Bin Saood to issue a similar prohibition to his dependents, the status of that strip of coast seems sufficiently uncertain and undeffnable to make it possible for us to treat it as coast covered either by the prohibition of Bahrain or that of Katar. There would then be no hiatus throughout the perimeter of the Gulf, and any consignment leaving Maskat, uncovered by a pass, would be seizable at sight as contraband, and the difficulty which at present exists of dealing with dhows under the French flag landing arms on the Katar coast, would then be greatly diminished. 6. It is worth noting that in practice the Katar Shaikhs tacitly recog nize and make no attempt to question our right to seize arms under export to their coast, and it is only vis a vis the French Government and the public that our action has no basis of authority.2 7. Perhaps the Government of India will think fit, in view of Captain Shakes pear’s present report, to take into consideration the practical possibilities of the courses which 1 have ventured to suggest. No. C.—40, dated Kuwait, the 21st June 1911 (Confidential). From— Captain W. H. I. Shakespear, Political Agent, Kuwait, ' To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bnshire. With reference to your telegram words 75 —10, dated the 10 th June 1911 , I have the honour to forward, for information, copy of a letter to the Political Agent, M a skat, which refers to the same consignment of which further parti culars were furnished to me by Major Knox in a later telegram. 2 . In this connection and with reference to my letter No. C.— 79 , dated * See letter froni Resident to Foreiirn Depart- the 20 tli December 1910 , I liaVO the ment, No. 58 , dated 7th January i9i i. honour to report that it is persistently p. z. cox. stated in Kuwait that Doha and Wakt’a in Katar are now regular arms depots. The arms and ammunition reach these places partly by caravan and partly by small fishing boats working along the coast from the vicinity of Abu Thabi. The boats used are very small and usually travel at night, spending most of the day anchored close in shore or even beached in one or other of the hays. As evidence of the stock in Katar I was informed by Shaikh Mubarak that Din Saood whilst encamped near Hasa received a few w r eeks ago 12 boxes of ammunition ( 1,500 rounds each) from Doha; whilst from Bin Saood’s own messenger I heard that the quantity received was 10 camel-loads, probably 30 or 40 boxes. I am also informed that a very considerable trade is done in arms smuggling between Katar and the Persian coast between Lingah and Bushire. No C.—39, dated Kuwait, the 21st June 1911 (Confidential). From— Captain W. H. I. Shakespeak, Political Agent, Kuwait, To—The Political Agent and His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Maskat. With reference to your telegram Words 90 — 12 , dated the 12th June 1911 , advising me of the shipment of arms concealed in cargo carried by the S. S. “ Bulimba ”, I have the honour to inform you that the telegram was received just as the vessel steamed into the port. I was able, however, to communicate its contents to Shaikh Mubarak before the lighters reached the shore and requested him to have the suspected cargo carefully searched before delivery. 2 . The Shaikh informs me that he had all cargo from Maskat placed under lock as soon as landed and himself saw it opened out in the Customs house on the same evening. No arms nor ammunition were found in any of the packages, in spite of a most thorough search. I do not think it was possible for the packages to have been tampered with before the Shaikh himself ordered their opening in his presence, and am inclined to think that the information received by you may possibly have been purposely disseminated as a ruse. The ship’s manifest, moreover, furnishes figures different to those contained in your telegram. The manifest shows the following to have been shipped from Maskat for Kuwait:— 6 Bundles Dry Limes, mark T. P., shipped by S. C. Agmizian [alias “ Nisban”) 27 „ „ „ M.K. „ H. A. Suliman. 8 „ Cotton „ A B.A. „ M. Ahmed. 1 „ Rose-leaves „ A.B A. „ M. Ahmed. There were no bundles of “ goat-hair” in the cargo for Kuwait. 3 . The consignees are not yet known for certain as delivery of these packages has not been asked for up to date, probably through fear arising from the Shaikh's search; Shaikh Mubarak, however, informs me that part of the goods are for one Mulla Abud and part for the Murafi house, both Persian firms. Hitherto I have had no confirmation from the bazaar that any arms were expected by this vessel or that if shipped they have been surreptitiously passed. 4. A copy of this letter is being forwaided to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, for his information.■INo 2544 (Confidential), dated Bushire, the 30 th September (received the 9 th October) 1911. From— Lieutenant-Colonel P. Z. Cox, C.S.I, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To— The Hon’ble Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Henry McMahon, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to forward herewith, in continuation of my telegram No 843 of 4th instant, a copy of the report furnished by the Political Agent, Kuwait, on the Marafi family of Kuwait, and their trading operations. 2. The device of bringing contraband arms to Kuwait concealed in cases of loaf sugar seems to have been resorted to just about the time when Messrs. Wonckhaus’ Agents were turning active attention to Kuwait {vide my telegram No 395 of 30th April), and it is at all events not improbable that the Marafis were put up to this method of introduction by the German firm. 3. It would seem advisable to await receipt of further information as to the result of the action of the Bombay Customs Authorities in regard to the consign ment seized there, before making any special representations to Shaikh Mubarak on the subject of the Marafi family. NOTE ON THE MARAFI FAMILY (PERSIANS) OF KUWAIT. The principal members of the Marafi family in Kuwait are given in the following genealogical table :— r Haidar (dead) Mahomed Rafiya (dead). Abdul Karim ■'I Nasir (dead) r Yusuf '1 Ismail. 'I Mahomed AIL r Abdul Hassan. Ibrahim. '1 Abdul Mehsin, Mahomed Husain. The above table gives the more important members, there being a number of others, both present in Kuwait and in Behbahan, from which district the family originally came. 2. They trade in the names of Haji Abdul Karim Behbani and Ismail bin Mahomed Ali Marafi. Between them the family owns two large sea-going vessels, two smaller “ booms ” trading between the Persian coast and Kuwait and one “water-boom.” 3. Their relations with the Shaikh are, and I believe have always been, most friendly—Ismail was the man the Shaikh selected to purchase his arms in Maskat, probably because of his knowledge but also I have no doubt because the Shaikh places considerable confidence in the family. 4. The family’s business is in food-stuffs. They purchase and ship dates from the Shatt-el-Arab to India in the autumn by their own two vessels and also by other chartered buggalows. From India these two boats return with timber spices, rope, coffee, etc. The other two boats are employed most of the year between Kuwait, Hindian, Mashurand Basrah carrying barley, wheat and pro bably also in smuggling tea, arms, and other articles which pay high duties intoy 2 Persia by the northern Gulf ports. The firm’s imports by steamers are not as large as might be expected, consisting chiefly of rice. It is also the fact I believe that they finance some of the local shroffs in the bazaar. The above may be said to be their ostensible business. 5. Anterior to 1910 the family shared with the other Persian house of Haji Mahomed Taqi the distinction of being the largest wholesale arms-dealers in Kuwait and their boats were largely employed in the arms traffic between Maskat and this port: at that time there seems to be no doubt the sale and purchase of arms and ammunition was their main business and at the end of 1909 they were reported to have a stock of nearly 6,ooo rifles and 1,500 cases of ammunition on their premises. How far they have succeeded in keeping up the trade it is difficult to conjecture but there seems little doubt that they constantly attempt smuggling and should their boats escape the Naval patrol there is every likeli hood of their being able to land the arms in Kuwait without the Shaikh’s knowledge, by the simple expedient of bribing his Customs officials. I was told that they succeeded in importing as much as 500 arms a month but cannot credit figure. Ismail Marafi is in constant communication with Maskat and his agents there are M. Nichan and the Goguyer firm and Mirza Husain. There now seems little doubt that the consignment of so called Loaf Sugar which was over carried by the S. S. “ Palamcotta ”, and that captured by the Customs officials in Bombay in the course of transhipment were destined for Ismail Marafi. A search through previous ships’ manifests brought the following suspicious consignments to light, of which delivery had been taken as stated below :— 20 cases Loaf Sugar mark M. K. shipped at Maskat, reached Kuwait by S.S. “ Bulimba” on the 24th March 1911, and delivery taken by Ismail Marafi. 25 cases Loaf Sugar mark K K-B.^ both transhipped from S.S. “ Lich- 26 „ „ ,, ,, S.M.K.) tenfels ” to S.S. “Madura” at Bombay reached Kuwait on 6th April 1911, *and delivery taken hy Ismail Marafi. \ case Hardware mark A J.

Haji Abdul Karim’s son, Abdul Hassan, however is said to have received a large advance from the German firm by way of forward purchase money and that he will buy what he can in Mashur and Hindian, shipping the grain if possible at the Shatt-el-Arab bar into the German Steamers. Beyond this I have heard of no other collection with the German firm. W. H. I. SHAKESPEAR, Captain, Political Agent, Kuwait. G.C. B. P., Simla.—No C235 P.

The mo^t necessary thing for me in life is to protect my dignity and honour. 1 most willingly promised to adhere to three conditions, and, thank God, 1 am doing accordingly. 1 now see that distrust is shown to me in one of the three., while my subjects are being troubled and their properties, which are shipped by their boats, and have given Bill of Lading, are lost. And I promised that nonn of my subjects should import arms, though they be given half the value of the arms for freight, especially my Arab subjects. Just as I keep up my dignity, they also keep theirs, and are obedient to my commands. One of the respectable nobles of Kuwait, who is mv neighbour, Khalifah- bin-Shahin Ai-Ghanem. has been coming in bis “ Buglow bis uncle Amad-biu- Muhammad Al-Ghanem in bis “ Dingiyah”, Abdul Latif-bin-Isa’s “ Buglow”, nakhoda Abbas’s boat, and that of Naser Al-Bedr, who is one of the greatest men of Kuwait, whose father is Yusof-bin-Bedr, who was well-known to the British Government on account of his good character, had loaded their boats with timber, pepper, tamarind, rope and various goods, each of these being kept in its respective place. Some of these belonged to the merchants ol Kuwait and some of them to those of Basra ; and they had given Bills of Lading on the numbers of the goods. The men-of-war caught them. The Captains were told by the nakhodas that they do not ship arms, though they be given half - their value, in obedience to the orders of their Shaikh and in order to keep up my dignity as well as theirs : but they did not listen to their words and insulted them and kept them three days. They took out all their cargoes on the men- of-war and on the decks of the vessels in which they searched without finding any arms. A big amount of the cargoes has been lost, partly being thrown into the sea and partly being banded from one to the other. These merchandise belong to the merchants of Kuwait and partly to those of Basra. The nakhodas will be held responsible for the goods which they have shipped according to the Bills of Lading. bat should they give for the shortage? I am lowered before you and distrust has been shown to me while I had promised that none of my subjects will ship arms. Ko faith has been placed in my promise. / As to those who are not my subjects, I have not given undertaking on their account, because I have no right on them. If they import any arms here, you have to check them. These vessels, i.c., Khalifa-bin-Shahin’s boat, Ahmad’s “ Dingiyah , Naser Al-Bedr’s boat, and Abdul Latif’s “ Buglow”, had shipped their cargoes from Malabar. Abbas’s boat had shipped her cargo from Yemen and con sisted of fish oil and cross bars. The fish oil was taken on board the men-of- war and the cross bars on the deck cf the boat. Great quantities of these two substances were destroyed, and the Captains and Lieutenants noticed them. These belong to the merchants who will ask for them according to the weight and numbers shown in the Bills of Lading. The vessels have been injured by colliding with the men-of-war and throwing woods in them. The upper edges, called “ Tarrik ”, have been crushed. Ahmad’s small boat, which has been on hoard, has been broken into pieces by throwing wood on it. Abbas’s anchor has been cut and the second one has been crushed. The experts estimate the expenses of the repairs, such as wood, nails, &amp;c., and the carpenter s uages at Rs. 3 , 400 . Price of Ahmad’s boat is Rs. GOO and the shortage of the goods will he stated after they have been landed. I wrote to my friend, Captain Shakespear, yesterday to inform you of my and my subjects’ requirements for arms. It is not now necessary. Every body who wants arms gets them from Katar and Bu-Ainain as the door is open there. I am exceedingly displeased at this proceeding and now beg to lav it before you. v *4* |M&gt;n made anVnojejt of recriminatior^and ridicule Vre t,hc main springs of hia resentment. \t was this sense of injilry which madA him speak of germinating his arms agreement and permitting th\ free import and export of arr^s, leaving itVo us to prevent the traffic to and from Kuwait as we thought lit. 8 .

The practically coincident arrival of the Vive boats with similar\stories has aroused Aery considerable resentment, and t\e Shaikh has been preWl to ike the line h\ has done as much by his leading! merchants as by hisXown tounded amowr propre. As ut appeared to m(\ that any serious rupture in cordial relations with the Shaikh must be avoided by all possible meaniXat the\ present time, I endeavoured to conciliate and soothe his pride—in otlVr circumstances I might have inclined to a more unbenVling attitude, holding the strict letter yf our arms agreement and his proclamation as justification^ i ut thrs would inevitably have bropo;ht about still mot^ resentment and prob ably leoUo an imvatse from wlsich there would have been no w;»y out except by forcibly insisting\on the observanee of his agreementffiy the Shaikh. 10. yn the same grounds, therefore, I would submit that, if it is possible without impairing tlm efficiency of naval measures, the\procedure suggested in paragraph 8 above may be given a\trial. The Shaikh’s own prohibition has undoubtedly had a ueterrent effect, and if suspected ve^Ls can be treated as mggested, 1 t\ink it wik be possible to ensure that an adequate investigation ikes place in Kuwait authe time of discharging cargo. The Shaikh has no ejection to moK or less empty boats beingWarched at sea, Vmt where large dh\vvs, full of timber and ether merehandiseyonsigned to merchants in Kuwait ancABasra, are concerned, the thorough searck required must Vnevitably lead to smocie damage, for which Vbe nakhoda becomes responsible to fhe consignee.

(zi&lt;) , 2 • C'Z^f 0f 1312 ' 'T ' ^ Politioal Agenoy, Kuwait. rir, With reference to the measures in foroe for pro- —hibition of the arms traffic, I have the honour to report the following complaint communicated to me by r 'heikh ^ir liubarak-us-gubah. 2. The r 'heildi oo.aplains that though he has given an un— -dertaicing to the British Govem^aent thaL he will prohibit all traffic in arm3 by his subjects or their vessels, though he has used every endeavour to prevent this traffic by letters to his agent in haskat and the direst threats to his own subjects and though no cases have been proved against his subjects (with the exception of a Persian na- -khuda oaught by H.f!S. H Philonel' in October last when the arms were not destined for Kuwait) His .Majesty's ships lately insisted on searching five large vessels bound from .,alabar and Yemen to Kuwait, causing in the search very serious loss and damage to the cargoes and vessels and aerely provine the r.bsenoe of aras, a faot which he would have r*have been prepared to cuarmitee personally without any search. 3. The vessels belong to 4 of the most respectable and substantial merchants of Kuwait three being personally known to me as unlikely to risk their ships in the arms trade and their arrival in the last two days, with highly- -ooloured stories of the searches to which they were sub- -jeoted, has caused a considerable amount of ill-feelinr. 4. The Sheikh called on me yesterday and gave me the gist of each complaint. I replied that I had no information as yet, but he must be aware that H.Ii's ships were now em- -ployed in a strennous endeavour to annihilate the traffic that they would not have undertaken the labour of search- -ing large over-sea vessels without some definite infor- -mation which their experience had shown them could not be verified without a most thorough search. If there had been damage or loss in the process I was prepared to take detailed statements and, as the vessels had been proved to be innocuous, to forward their claims with recommend- —ations towards compensation. The ^heikh who was exceem— A -ingly angry said that it was not the search so much, qua search, to which he objected as the apparent absence of all consideration for the cargo and vessels, the callous disregard of all protests .cade by respectable men in the vessels, and the loss of prestige which he xiimselj., in spite of all his efforts to assist the Br^tiSii Governmeno^ suffered. As the Sheikh went so far as to speak of re pudiating his obligations under his arms agreement of May 1900, I perceived that argument was useless until his temper had had some time to cool and the interview u^j.Oj. 6— -fore closed. 5. To-day I visited him in the hope of finding him in a more reasonable frame of mind and on expressing my regret that his people should have been put to any loss drew from him a more lucid account of what is said to have occurredooourred. It appears that one vessel was searched whilst there v^as considerable sea running and a good deal of da.aage resulted to her, that another had her dinghy broken up, that all were dauaged to a nore or less extent ut+clU. 1 to repair/it is estimated will cost is.4, 000 /-, that all had their cargo shifted, and returned without regard to stowage, part lost, part damaged, etc of the extent of which no esti late can be aade until the cargoes are dic- -charged and compared with the Dills of hading. I en deavoured to obtain his recognition of the case for the other side, who were not in a position to differentiate as to the reliability or otherwise of the word of parti- -cular owners or nakhudas, who would certainly not have undertaken a very laborious search without what nust have appeared to then good reliable information, who oould not be responsible for the weather prevailing at the tine, and who sifter all were only acting in virtue of the rheikh's own agreement with ourselves, and who, so far fro a showing their want of appreciation of the Sheikh's efforts at as- -sistanoe in the prohibition of the Arms Traffic, had hi- -therto in reliance on his oo-operation been able to pass Kuwait dhows with a muoh less rigorous investigation than others. Eventually the 'heikh admitted grudgingly that there ware two sides to the question and we arranged for the ITakhudas to be sent to me to record their statements and a more detailed report will be submitted later in this respect. 6 . What has particularly incensed the ''heikh is that the 5 vessels happen to belong to the most respeotable and leading men in the place, that he feels his own word has been doubted, that he is now subject to recriminations for having been (so to speak) deluded by the British G-overn- -ment into assisting them whilst voluntarily making iat- -tere difficult for his own subjects in the matter of arms without any compensating 'quid pro quo’ in the way of securing them from the molestation by British men-of-war toto whioh other craft Ixave to sub.ait and that hiD eneniec in Dacra and eleowliero will aoiae on the inoident to him for hiB blind faith in 3rioi.ii f a i r - ’O. a - -ing. 7. I have reldom ciecn the ''hf iidi BO loved, and the faot that he feolc his honour and good faith have been im pugned and that he fanoioe he has been .lade an objoot of recrimination and ridicule are the main springB of hie resentment. It was this sense of injury which . ode him rpeah of teriinating his arms agreement and permit- -ting the free i:aport and export of arms leaving it to uo to prevent siie traffic to and from Kuwait as we thought fit. 8. I wan able however to induce him oo give up ohis foolish idea, though he asKed of me in return that. I would represent in detail what had happened, how it dn- - laged his prestige and solicit that Government would issue orders that Kuwait boats loaoed up .?iuh -.argo should not be subjected to a search at :ea. he was pre pared to make the severest example of any Kuwait ov/ner nakhuda or vessel proved to be carrying arms and if Naval officers received information leading them to sus pect any particular boat all he asked was that the cargo should not be interfered with, that a mn with a letter to the Political Agent be put on board with or- -ders never to leave the boat and the boat ordered to proceed diroot to Kuwait. On arrival the Political Agent could put another reliable oan on board if hw de - -sired which the Sheikh would also do and the cargo would then be unloaded and searched under the eyes of and by the three men in concert, if aivir- were founu he would punish owner, nakhuda and boat in a way that would be an example -o the people pf Kuwait, for the future. I said I would forward his representations with such re- -oommendations as I could add and ask for an early reply- X was not in a position, however, either to give anan undertaking that further searohes would not be made at sea , nor to assure him that his plan would be approved &amp; as suggested above. 9. The praotioally ooinoident arrival of the five boats with similar stories has aroused very considerable resnt.- -nent and the Sheikh has been pressed to take the line he has done as much by his leading merchants as by his own wounded 'amour propre'. As it appeared to me that any ser~ -ious rupture in our cordial relations with the Sheikh mus-o be avoided by all possible means at the present time I endeavoured to conciliate and soothe his pride— in other circumstances I might have inclined to a more unbending attitude, holding to the strict letter of our arms agree- -ment and his proclamation as justification, but this would inevitably have brought about still more resentment and probably led to an impasse from which there would have beeh no way out except by forcibly insisting on the observance of his agreement by the Sheikh. 10. On the same grounds therefore I would submit that, if it is possible without impairing the efficiency of Naval measures, the procedure suggested in para 8 above may be given a trial.. The hheikh's own prohibition has undoubt edly had a deterrent effect and if suspected vessels can be treated as suggested I think it will be possible to en sure that an ad ; quate investigation takes place in Kuwait at the time of' discharging cargo. The Sheikh has no objec tion to core or less eipty boats being searched at sea, but w^ere large dhows full of timber and other merchandise consigned to merchants in Kuwait and Basra are concerned , the thorough search required must inevitably lead to some damage, for which the nakhuda becomes responsible to the consignee. 11. I would also observe that the loss of the Sheikh's oo-operqtion would materially add to our diffioulties in dealing with the Arms Traffic . At present the Katar ports and Qasr-as-Sabaih appear to have developed into regular depots and a similar situation at Kuwait with the Sheikh'soonnivanoe is worth avoiding if avoidance is possible with the r&gt;h©ikh as coadjutor. 12. in conclusion I would beg that I nay be favoured with an early reply for ouimnication to the Bheihh.

As regards (i), I require further information from Captain Shakespear on one or two points before I can offer useful comment and I am also not sure how far the concluding sentences of the Shaikh’s cancelled letter to me [enclo. (iii)] are now intended to hold good. I will telegraph my views on receipt of his reply to my enquiries. 3 . As regards (ii), I have already telegraphedt to the Government of India and His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief and merely send the present papers for further information. 4 . Enclosure (iii) is the translation of a letter sent over to the Political Agent by Shaikh Mubarak for despatch to me, but subsequently withdrawn by the Shaikh on Captain Shakespear’s advice. Although not now an official document, it seems worth forwarding to Government for information, as indicat ing the Shaikh’s state of mind and the inevitable tendency of our arms traffic operations generally to arouse resentment. 5 . The Shaikh’s references to the open door at (i) Katav and (ii) Kasr-us- Subaih are no doubt well-founded in the first case and probably in the second, hut I shall endeavour to obtain further information on the point. Perusing all these letters together I cannot avoid the suspicion that the vehemence of the Shaikh’s complaint in regard to his treatment may be partly connected with his desire to import more arms, but, in any case, I think the circumstantial details given and Captain Shakespear’s reference to the feeling created among the inhabitants of Kuwait generally on learning of the experi ences of the five dhows in question, demonstrate that the simultaneous repre sentation of the two matters is moie coincidence than design. No. 38 C., dated Kuwait, the 15th May 1912 (Confidential). From —Captain W. H. I. Shakespbar, Political A^ent, Kuwait, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to forward, attached hereto, copy and translation of a letter received by me yesterday from Shaikh Sir Mubarak-us-Subah explaining his request for permission to import a largely increased number of arms and ammunition. 2. The Shaikh’s letter speaks for itself and I need only observe here that the first questions I put in conversation in regard thereto were enquiries as to why the Shaikh had not already taken advantage of the permission accorded six months ago for 2,500 arms and over 6 lakhs of rounds and further how the need for so large a demand had arisen so suddenly.46 8. The Shaikh’s replies are, taking the latter question first, that the tribesmen acknowledging his authority have grown in number, that a recent raid has compelled him to put a properly armed force again into the field, that a large number (as many as a hundred) of new diving boats have been put into commission for the present pearling season, and that, owing to the facility with which the southern tribes having access to Katar and Katif have been able to arm themselves, he is compelled in self-defence to arm the Kuwait pearl-boats more heavily than has been customary hitherto. Formerly these boats usually carried about eight to ten rifles apiece, but for tiie above reason it has now become necessary to arm one-half their comple ments, whilst the boats carrying the pearl-towashes, who frequently have on board with them over a lakh in either specie or pearls, require to have every man fully armed. The Shaikh’s letter furnishes the reply to my first query—that the arms already accorded permission are so insufficient as to put him to a difficulty in distribution. 4 . So far as I can ascertain, the above reasons given by the Shaikh are true in the main. Owing to the comparative scarcity of arms which prohibi tion of the traffic during the last two-and-kalf years has produced in Kuwait, the Shaikh has been enabled to draw into his political sphere as more imme diately dependent upon him a large number of Bedouin who look to him alone for their weapons and ammunition. The southern tribes, more particularly the Ajman, Bani Hafir and Bani Khalid, have certainly been able to obtain arms cheaply and easily from Katar and the Al-bu-Ainain’s settlement at Kasr-us- Sabaih. Consequently, the Shaikh’s fear for the safety of the Kuwait pearling- boats and their ability to defend themselves with*their former number of weapons is not unfounded. The Kuwait pearling-fleet probably numbers bet ween 700 and 800 boats, which means at a very moderate estimate not less than 20,000 to 25,000 men afloat. 5 . Taking these circumstances into consideration, the Shaikh’s large figures lose much of their startling aspect. At the same time it must be borne in mind that if the Shaikh desired he would not have much difficulty, presuming that the Naval patrols continue blockading the Persian coast, in importing double or treble the number of arms he mentions in his letter to me. Moreover, for the last two years at least, he has been losing what used to be a very lucrative item of his customs revenue. Taking all these facts into consideration, 1 venture to submit that, unless Government are prepared to institute a really effective blockade of the Arab coast as well as the Persian which would have to include search of all pearling-boats, it is a mistaken policy on our part to risk alienating the good-will of a Buler, who, it must be admitted, has for the last two years met our wishes in the suppression of the arms traffic in no ungener ous spirit. 6. The figures previously given by the Shaikh did not anticipate a change in conditions so close to his domains, a change in fact which has taken place within the last nine months, and I confess that, when forwarding his requests last summer, I did not foresee the present state of affairs. 7 . In conclusion, I would urge that Shaikh Mubarak’s request may be accorded such favourable consideration as may be possible, and beg that I may he furnished with early instructions for a reply to his letter. Translation of a letter from Shaikh Sir Mubarak-us-Subaih, K.C.I.E., Ruler of Kuwait, to Captain W. H. I. Shakespear, Political Agent, Kuwait, dated the 27th Jamadi-ul- Awal 1330 (14th May 1912). After compliments, and making enquiry after your health, this is what I would address to Your Honour and ask you that you will explain this my request to Bis Excellency Colonel Sir Percy Cox, that I, (your) loyal (friend), explain to you the pressure of our necessities for arms from the continual demands of my subjects, all of them, of my own people and the tribesmen, of their requirements for arms, and I, without your order and approval, never47 sliail brii g arms and will not consent to anyone bringing them, either openly or secretly. The obedience to your approval upon me that is what is necessary. For those who are now wanting weapons, it is not for trading (in them) hut that they may he in their hands for the purpose of defence, for other foreign tribesmen oppress our subjects in our trade, people of the south and others. In these days just past a number of camels belonging to the mer chants, people of Kuwait, Ahmed-al-Hamaizi and others, amounting to 600 camels sent out in the hands of their men to Egypt for trade, the Ajman and their allies took them and besides this also upon our subjects the tribesmen ha ve been many robberies, and we sent our servants to the headmen of the Ajman with letters for the purpose of their (the camels , ) restoration ; there returned of them a few, ani the greater part are with them (the Ajman), and all the Bedouin, if they do not see force do not give justice. Now there are in their hands weapons, which they obtain from Katar and from the Al-bu-Ainain at prices of $15 to $18 and the ammunition at $5 a hundred and on our side now weapons are not obtainable and if findable and acceptable one obtains them at $10 to $50 and the cartridges one takes at $12 to $L 5 and tliis is the state ; we see in it upon us great damage and it is incumbent upon us that we should explain to you the circustances and the order is with you. Yester day came to me of my own people and the heads of the tribesmen* and showed me the amount of their wants of arms and of ammunition. Apart from mv own necessities, there is required for them at least 6,000 weapons of various kinds, Martinis and others, and with each weapon 400 rounds and our own requirements, especially to us, 1,000 arms and with each weapon 400 rounds. Also there is necessity for extra ammunition for the furnishing of those weapons which are now in the hands of our servants and those which are distributed amongst our tribesmen, to the amount of 4 lakhs, for we have no ammunition (left). In these days we have sent our son Ali-al-Khalifa, prepared for war with 500 men, and we sent with him the Shaikh of the Ajman for the purpose of obtaining the camels of the merchants which are in their possession and those which (belong) to our tribesmen and the limit to which we completed their ammunition (is) 40 cartridges to each man and those who require arms, of our own people and tribesmen, Katar and the Al-bu-Ainain are close to them and press to bring their requirements, but I have forbidden them and I do not permit that, as the divers to the south of them reach to Katar and to the Al-bu-Ainain and these every day meet them and the force upon them of the prohibition (is such that) even if the people of Katar and the Al-bu-Ainain bring them (arms) to them to their boats, they do not accept them (so much so) that even the Subaihat (Bedouin) who spend their spring time in our parts and their summer in Katif have offered (the tribesmen) that they will bring to them (from) the Al-bu-Ainain (arras) and I have prohibited them for obedience to your order that is necessary to me. For we, according to the wants of our subjects, ot our own people and tribesmen those arms of which there is permission, will bring them from Maskat to the number of 2,000. Now it is a difficulty upon us that we bring them and to whom Me should give them and whom we should leave (without). Therefore we have explainedTthe state to you and the order is to you and may you be preserved. No. 39 C., dated KuwaitAthe 15th May 1912 (ConiVlential). l^om— Captain W. H. I.

The Shaikh called ©n me yesterday and gave mY the gist of each complamt. 1 replied that I hWl no information as yet, but he\must he aware that IIis Majesty’s ships were now employed in a strenuous endeavour to annihilate the traffic that th&lt;W would not have undertaken\ the labour of searching large over-sea vessels without some definite information which their experience had shown them comld not be yverified without a most thorough search.

Ihe Shaikh who was exceedingly angry said that it was not the search so much, search 1 to which he objectefl as the apparent absence of all Consideration for the cargo and vessels, the callous disregard\of all protests madetby respect able men in the vessels, and the loss of prestige which he himseljv in spite of all his effort to assist the BritishlGovernment,{suffered. As the titaikh went so far as to speak of repudiating Ibis obligations under his arms aglreem^nt of May 1900 , I, perceived that argument was useless until his temper had had some time to\cool and the interview therefore closed. hope of finding him in a more reasonable is people should huve been ore lucid accbunt of what is saiaVto have was searched, \ whilst there was cbnsider- ‘ damage resulted to her, that another had amaged to a mCre or less extent, toYrepair 000 , that all had their cargo shifted, and rt lost, part damaged, &amp;c., of the extent intil the cargoes\are discharged and ^om- of ideavoured to otwain his recognitioi 5 .

FromiLi.UTENANT.Coi.oNEL Sir Percy Cox, K.C.I.E , C.S I., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To-The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department With reference to the correspondence ending with His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief’s telegram of the 11 th September to my address, repeated to the Marine Department, regarding the capture by the son of the Residency A-ent on the Trucial Coast of a large consignment of arms and ammunition I have the honour to forward, for the information of the Govern- ammunnion, iim „ ent 0 f India, copies of the marginally ijo’ (Uied 3ri'&amp;p'emher 1912. cited communications, which 1 have now received from Shargah, giving the details of the capture. 2 It will be seen that the caravan was one sent by the Maskatgang, now busilv occupied in getting rid of their stocks, and that the capture of the ^ignme y nt which was only in transit along the hinterland P-allel o he coast 0 en route to the Ghanadhah creek (Ghanatlia of the Admiralty Chart), about 40 miles beyond Debai, was primarily rendered feasible by the refusal of the Oman catnelmen to go further, and a consequent delay of {our , or , fiv ® davs in the hiring of fresh camels for the rest of the journey from the local kitab Bedouin, a break of connection which gave time for news to leak out and the successful action reported, to he taken. 3 I have asked the Residency Agent privately to let me know how he thinks Shaikh Nasir-bin-Ahmed (half-brother to the Chief of ym-el-Kuwam) and the other persons who assisted can be most suitably rewarded, and I wi make suggestions on receipt of his reply ; meanwhile I have written to Sha kh Nasi! and Isa-bin-Abdul Latif personal letters thanking them for their courageous action and congratulating them on the success thereof. I may mention that Shaikh Nasir has for some time been an exile from Dm-el-Kuwain, the Chief having turned him and his family out in connection with a murder said to have been committed by one of Nasir s sons, and a suspicion against the family generally of harbouring tMs Rashid’s life. I have taken the opportunity to ask the latter to make this valuable service on the part of bis brother an occasion for a reconciliation with him.20G /} - 4 . I shall likewise, on receipt of full particulars, report further on Shaikh Sugar’s conduct in failing to take action when appealed to, and make such suggestions as seem called for. Meanwhile, he has so far co-operated, after the event, as to receive the three prisoners into custody and, later, to hand them over at my instance to H. M. S. “ Pelorus”, The Agent’s letter, in referring to Shaikh Sagar, merely states that he refused altogether to give assistance, hut there are local conditions which would affect the Shaikh’s attitude which, though not mentioned by Khan Bahadur Abdul Latif, cannot be altogether ignored in forming an estimate of the Shaikh’s conduct. These Chiefs have no standing force and have to rely for the safety of their towns against Bedouin depredations mainly upon the maintenance of friendly pacts and relations with the Bedouin of the hinterland. The tribe wdiom Shargah has to reckon with is the Beni kitab [vide Gazetteer); so that if, as in this case, the tribe were, or were about to be, connected with the caravan, the seizure of it by Shaikh Sagar would be liable to bring him and Ins town into feud with them. It will be seen, therefore, that in affording or refusing active co-operation the Shaikh had to look further ahead than the mere seizure of these particular arms, lie could also no doubt have had at the back of his mind the case of the seizure of arms by the Shaikh of Debai last year and its untoward sequel. But although refusing to participate himself for some such consideration as the above, Shaikh Sagar would have no objection to our Agent doing what he could and would hesitate the less to co-operate when he saw that there was no longer any question of his being embroiled with the Beni kitab. But while giving this explanation of local conditions, I am not of the opinion that the Shaikh’s conduct in this case can be overlooked, and shall, as above stated, make suggestions later. 5 . Meanwhile, the present incident seems to afford another cogent ground for stronger British representation on that coast. A British officer with a few camel sowars at his back would, I believe, be able to do a great deal towards- keeping the hinterland free from the attentions of the arms-smuggliog fraternity. 6. One of the inhabitants of Katar quoted as being interested in these arms,—Bin Mana’a,—is no doubt a member of the locally well known “Bin Mana’a” or “A 1 Mana’a” family of Doha, related, I believe, by marriage to the Bin Thani Shaikhs. It was a member of this family, probably the same Vide Residency telepram No. 370 , dated the 24th OHC, who WaS hit by tile SeizUT© of the Airil 1911, and connected correspondence. dhow “ Fath-al-Khair ” in April 1911 . 7 . I am suggesting by telegraph that the three Arab prisoners, residents of Doha, now in custody on His Majesty’s ship “ Pelorus ”, should be given a term of imprisonment at Karachi as a deterent to others. There seems no practical or political objection to the course, 8. I should mention in conclusion that the Sultan, worked upon no doubt by Saiyid Yusuf Zawavi, thought it necessary to ask the Political Agent to make a pro forma appeal or remonstrance to me on his behalf regarding this seizure and the arrest of the Katar men, but His Highness received with a smile the reply that it could not be entertained and that I was surprised at his having made it. I am sending a copy of this letter, with enclosures, to His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief and the Political Agent, Maskat. \ - Translation of a letter from the Residency Agent, Shargah, to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, No. 394, dated the 1st September 1912. Since I received your letters, Nos. 138 , 155 and 156 , dated the 24 th July, 15 th August aud 17 th August, respectively, I have used the utmost endeavours to draw the attention of the Shaikhs to the necessity of taking precautions, with a view to stopping the arms traffic and the importation or exportation of arms in or out of their territories. Recognising that the assurances of the Shaikhs in regard to this problem were insincere and that they had no activeintention of taking measures to deal with those alleged to he concerned in the traffic, I appointed spies at Shargah, Ajman and Dehai. When I was engaged at Pebai in making enquiries about arms, and while my son, Isa, was making similar investigations at Shargah, I received a letter from him stating that, according to reports supplied to him by the Bedouins of the Batinah Coast, certain inhabitants of Nejd had brought with them a quantity of arms to the hinterland, to a point some five miles distant from the town of Shargah, the arms having been imported for them by the Batinah Bedouins. I sent a reply to Isa instructing him to ask Shaikh Sagar, Chief of Shargah, to take measures to seize the arms. Isa duly requested Shaikh Sagar to take steps accordingly, but the latter did not agree. Isa pressed his request on the Shaikh and asked him at any rate to supply him with two men to accompany him to the place where the consignment now was. The Shaikh did not agree, however, assert ing that he would not take measures in the hinterland, but only if the arms were brought to Sargah, though the place where the arras now were was within his limits. Accordingly, Isa himslf engaged several Bedouins and certain Baluch residents of Shargah and took with him Shaikh Nasir-bin- Ahmad, the brother of the Shaikh of Um-el-Kuwain, with three of the latter’s sons, who w’ere all armed. The Bedouins and the B luehis were also armed and they all hastened to the scene. By the grace of God, the arms w r ere seized as well as those three persons who remained with them, the fourth man running away w-hen he saw the party. Isa and his companions remained there until the arms and ammunition were brought to my house at Shargah. A number of the inhabitants of Shargah and some Bedouins came to the place w here the arms were lying; and as some of the weapons were buried in the earth wdiile some remained exposed, some of the Bedouins pilferred two bundles rifles and two bundles Martini cartridges. This result was achieved by the endeavours of your servant Pa, and Shaikh Sagar did not afford the least assistance in the matter. It is obvious that, in view of Shaikh Sagar’s refusal, Isa has run a risk in capturing the weapons, but no untoward incident has taken place, by the help of God, as Isa’s companions were not sparing in their endeavours, especially Shaikh Nasir-bin-Ahmad and his sons, and the object was thus gained in the easiest manner. Translation of a letter from the Residency Agent, Shargah, to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, No. 395, dated the 3rd September 191£. With reference to my letter No. 394 , dated the 1st September 1912 , on the subject of the arms seized, I have the honour to state that the arms and ammunition seized are as follows :— Mauser rifles • • • 650 Martini rifles • • • 144 5 -shots Magazine • • • 59 10-shots Magazine • • • 22 Total ... 875 rifles and fiO tin-lined boxes cartridges for the said rifles. I beg to forward herewith, for Your Honour’s information, a statement made by the three inhabitants of the West who were in charge of the said arms. According to their statement, the weapons belonged to— Ali-bin-Musa, Goguyer, the Frenchman, Menashi, the Frenchman, Nishan, the Frenchman, Gabriel who is supposed to be a German, Saiyid Yusuf ez Zawavi, and were sent in charge of the said inhabitants of the West to Katar, and the person who was responsible for hiring transport and boat for the arms andi»T- 20S shipping them from the Ghanadha creek to Katar was an individual named Hamad-bin-Kharriyef (who took care of the arms from Sohar to the Oman Coast). The three men have been surrendered by me to the Chief of Shargah, so that he may keep them in safe custody until orders are received from Your Honour about them. The name of the said commissary was Hamad- bin Kharriyef. Statement of three inhabitants of the West who were the bearers of arms, viz., Sau'ud-bin. Abdullah-bin«Sulaiman, Muhammad-bin-Mafjan and Abdullah-bin-Abdul Karim ; the fourth, named Sa'ad-el-Kharji, absconded when the arms were seized. They are originally inhabitants of Nejd, but have settled down at Doha in Katar for the last four years. In the beginning of their residence there, they carried on pearling work and each of them earned Us. 50 . They left the work as it was too tiresome and engaged themselves in dealing in sheep when the people of Pars came to Katar and brought sheep for sale. They (the deponents) used to buy sheep and sell them at a profit They used to enter into partnership with each other some time and visit Katif and Bahrain where they purchased dates and sold them at Katar. They made up their minds, afterwards, to deal in perfumes and proceeded to Maskat where they bought “ wars ” (ochre) (a sort of yellow wash for the face), lignum, aloes, &amp;c., and returned by steamer to Bahrain where they sold some of them, taking the remainder to Katar. This is the second year that they have been engaged in this business. In their previous voyage to Maskat they became acquainted with Ali-bin-Musa and Saiyid Yusuf-ez-Zawavi. During this voyage, when they arrived at Maskat on the 1 st Shaban ( 16 th July), they were summoned seven days after their arrival by Ali-bin-Musa, Hamzah Bahraini, agent of Goguyerj the Prenchman, Menashi the Prenchman, Nishan, the Prenchman, Gabriel, who is supposed to be a German, and Saiyid Yusuf-ez-Zavvavi, all of whom possess arms depots. They (the arms dealers) made an arrangement with them (the deponents) to send arms from Maskat to Sohar and thence to Katar and asked them only to protect the arms until they reached their (the senders’) agents there and paid them Us. 400 as their remuneration, promising that on their arrival at Katar the agents will give them a present of 100 rupees and that the hire of the camels used by them for riding and their provisions will be paid by the arms dealers. The agreement being concluded, the arms dealers shipped the weapons in a boat from Maskat to Sohar to their agents, the principal of whom was Mulla Ibrahim, agent of Ali-bin-Musa. The four inhabitants of the West visited Sohar in the vessel carrying the arms and the agents hired some inhabitants of Batinah, called “ Bedat ”, to transport them, and the person who was doing the needful in this connection was one named Hamad-bin-Kharriyef, and the arms were loaded on sixty camels. The arrangement between the camel drivers and the agents was that they should bring the weapons to the territories of the Beni Katab and that Hamad aforesaid should thence hire the camels of the Beni Katab as far as Khor Ghanadhah. Prom Khor Ghanadhah, Hamad- bin-Kharriyef had to proceed to Abu Dhabi and hire a boat to take the arms from Khor Ghanadhah to Katar in charge of the four men of the West; and the agents who had to take delivery at Katar were named Ali-bin-Mulla and Bin Mana’a. When Haraad-bin-Kharriyef arrived with the weapons at a place called Thowaimah, the Bedouins unloaded the arms there. After the aforesaid Hamad gave them five rifles —3 Mausers and 2 five-sbot magazines—they agreed to (continue to) transport the arms. After appointing a man of the Benikatab tribe to supply the four caretakers with drinking water, the afore said Hamad went to the Benikatab tribe to hire camels with them to carry the The caretakers remained there for three days awaiting the said Hamad’s return with camels, but he did not come back. The Katbi tribesman who was bringing water for them left them after telling them that they would be captured in that place. On the fifth night they were approached by certain persons riding on donkeys and attired like grass-cutters. The caretakers told them not to approach them but they were not checkedand. stated that they would remain there to gather grass. When they came near and engaged in conversation the caretakers were attacked on three sides and were told that they would be murdered They (caretakers) asked for quarter and left the arms. The persons who had attacked them tied up their hands from behind and sent them to the Residency Agent’s house at Shargah. Some of the weapons were buried under sand and some of them were not buried. They (caretakers) had no letters with them from the owners of the arms at Maskat to the agents at katar, and it is probable that the letters were with Hamad-bin-Kharriyef. This statement was taken before me. Abdul Latif, Khan Bahadur.
