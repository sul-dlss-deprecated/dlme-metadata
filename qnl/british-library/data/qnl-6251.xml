According to Shaikh Sultan, Shaikh Khali fall bin Muhammad, a relative of the Shaikh of Sharjah, informed him that both Eumaid and ^aif bin ’Abdullah were trying to arrange a plot against him and that they asked Bhaikh Khalifeh to join them. Shaikh Khalifah informed Shaikh Sultan that the object was to enter the Shaikh’s fort and take hold of Shaikh Sultan and hand him over to his nephew Humaid. Both Humaid and Saif bin ’Abdullah refuted the Shaikh of Sharjah’s contentions and asked for proof but he did not listen to them. According to the Shaikh, Khan sahib Husain kept Saif bin ’Abdullah in his house at Dubai for about 20 days on the pretence of getting local treatment there, but in fact to disgyize their acts.

On 15th / May Ahmad Kajur went to Kira in search for some of his sailors. As the action of Ahmad Kajur was contrary to the custom observed on the Truciai Coast, namely that he should ask his Shaikh to take action against his subject, Shaikh * Abdur Hahman of Kira ordered that Ahmad Kajur should be put in stocks. Shaikh Humaid of Himriyah hai&gt;pened to be at Kira then and he requested Shaikh 1 Abdur Rahman to release Ahmad. As soon as the news about the arrest of Ahmad reached Njman, the Shaikh of Ajman notified his people that they should not go out of Ajman either 'East or west H of Ajioan and that all should carry their arms and be prepared for war.

When Ahmad Kajur reached Ajman, the Shaikh released the Hira and Sharjah people and kept the Himriyah people in stocks for he heard trial the arrest of Ahmad Kajur was due to the instigation of Shaikh Humaid, which was not true.

In spite of his promise to the notables of the Albu Falasah, the Shaikh of Dubai has not yet been able to settle the matter owing to the uncompromising attitude which his wife Hissah, and his son Rashid had adopted. The delay had caused general grumbling among the Albu Falasah and the majority of them have united against Shaikh Sa’id for being under the influence of his wife and son without caring for the bad consequences. They have been holding private meetings at Dairah quarters,where the majority O’f the Albu Falasah notables live, and have been discussing the whole situation and the affairs of Dubai. The question of the mopor car incident had given the Albu Falashh the chance of using it as a peg from which they want to air grievance. They asked the Shaikh to fix allowances for them and he gave them no reply.

Through the intervention of Shaikh Zaid bin Saqr he retruned the switch to the Sharjah driver who brought the bedouins to Sharjah and then reported the matter to the Shaikh.

You will remember when I was la£t in Sharjah we dis cussed the possibility of giving the Shaikh of Dubai some advice in regard to the revision of his Customs system. I have now discussed this matter in detail with the Director of Customs here and I think the following will be the best scheme for Dubai, if you can get the Shaikh to agree to it. 2, The first thing to do is to discover the value of all articles imported into Dubai bazaar or exported by sea irom Dubai. This value should be fixed according to standard local weights, i.e. at so much per maund (the maund of course should be a fixed weight and not a variable weight) or so much per bundle, tin, raffa, crate or jotta. It should be perfectly easy to find out such values in consultation with the merchants. Having done this, a fixed tariff should then be prepared at five per cent of the value of a maund, bundle etcetera of each article, and this tariff should then be published at the Customs House and all over the bazaar. I enclose herewith a copy of the fixed Customs Duty Schedule which is used in Bahrain to show you how this should be rmade out. 3. Whenever a steamer comes to Dubai a copy of the ship’s manifest should be obtained showing the cargo landed in Dubai And in the case of dhows and smaller craft, the Customs Ins pector could prepare this manifest for the nakhuda by actual examination of the cargo brought in. Then from this info rrna t i on/-information and from the schedule of duties, it is very easy to work out exactly what sum of money is due on the whole cargo landed. Of course the actual duty collected may toe taken from several different people, tout toy this system the Shaikh himself can always check collections and see that he actually receives the amount which should toe collected toy the Customs Department. 4. The schedule of duties should remain in force for atoout a year and then toe revised according to local market rates, tout whenever such a revision is made the new tariff should of course toe published so that everybody knows exactly where he stands. 5. It is otovious that if a system of this sort is to toe successful the Shaikh must have an honest man in charge of his Customs Department, and he must make sure that that man employs two or three literate clerks one at least of whom knows English. It will of course toe far better to employ someone who is not a Dubai subject for the post of Customs Inspector, since there wil then toe less chance of his preparing false manifests at the re quest of some -friend of his in Dubai. However, even if this is not possible and if the Shaikh has to employ some of his own peo pie to run the. Customs Department, the scheme set out above should toe reasonably fool-proof; and if the Shaikh takes a per sonal interest in it he can do a lot to ensure that there is no dishonesty. In order to make even more certain that there is no dishonesty, I suggest that the best way of paying the Mudir or Inspector would be toy giving him a percentage of the total collections. If for instance he gets ten per cent of the Customs duty received this would toe more than suffi cient for his own pay and for him to maintain his own staff77 - -3- of clerks. The Shaikh of course would have to appoint guards and naturs at his own expense, and this would pro vide an additional form of security against dishonesty. 6. I hope that the above is quite clear, but if there is any point on which you are in doubt please write to me again. If you are quite certain that you follow the system yourself will you please see the Shaikh and on my behalf suggest that he introduces a system of this sort. It will bring him in a quite considerable income, and should go a long way to remove the grievance of some of the members of the Albu Falasah to the effect that the only man who makes any money out of the Customs is the Persian Director. That particular individual should of course be removed at once. Political Agent, BahrainIK. Mk Confidential No, C/514-13/2 Political Agency, Bahrain, the 8th August 1938. To The Residency Agent, Sharj ah. Memorandum. Reference your confidential memorandum No. C/490-3/1 dated the 2nd August 1938, and also your secret and personal letter to the Honourable Mr. H. Weightman, dated the 2nd Aug ust 1938, on the subject of the troubles at Dubai between the Shaikh and his relatives. 2. It is entirely foreign to our policy on the Trucial Coast to engage in active interference in the internal affairs of the Shaikhdoms, and no question can therefore arise of establishing a '’mandate' or appointing our own nominee as Adviser at Dubai. 3. It is, however, a matter of concern to us that dis turbances, such as that between the Shaikh and his cousins, should be successfully brought to a conclusion* and although the original outbreak has been quietened down, your memorandum % under reference shows that the Shaikh's refusal to stand by his solemn promise to grant redress of grievances in certain respects, is liable at any moment to cause a fresh conflagra- ! tion. Even were it not for the Shaikh's promise, it is clear that the demands of the Albu Falasah represent a programme of &lt; development, which is suited to the increased importance of Dubai; and of such a programme we cannot fail to approve, so far as is consistent with our general policy of maintaining the authority of the ruling Shaikh. It is clear enough that these reforms have the support of the majority of the inhabitants/-- 2 - inhabitants of Dubai. 4. (a) You should therefore approach the Shaikh of * Dubai and point out to him how unreasonable it is for him to complain of the attitude of the Albu Falasah when he himself makes no effort to implement the under taking he has given to introduce reforms - and has even H stated his determination to discard that agreement. (b) You should further impress on him the neces sity of curbing the hot-headed activities of Hashid and you might tell him that it can do no good either to him- i self or Hashid to listen to the lying tales of every self- seeking intriguer. (c) You should also refer to the advice which has been given by the Honourable Mr. Weightman with regard to the reform of his customs administration, and should as certain to what extent he proposes to put this into effect. 5. Please report to me the attitude of the Shaikh on each of the points enumerated in the preceding paragraph. 6. You should not refer to his implied request for tne protection of the British Government on his own account and on account of his son. Should the Shaikh himself have more to say on this subject you should tell him that this is matter on which he must approach the Political Agent direct. For your own information I might add that it is contrary to policy to support any Shaikh against public opinion. Political Agent, Bahrain.Confidential.

This excited the Albu Falasah who occupied the remaining 2 towers on Daira side, to use them in self-defence they said. 5. I went and saw Shaikh Said in the afternoon. He hinted to me not to interfere and that he had sent a depu tation to come into direct agreement with his relatives. In spite I continued my efforts and reminded him of the pledge he had given his relatives. He denied having given any pledge. 6 ./- V- 2 - 6 * I returned to Sharjah at 22 hours after having warned and taken assurances from both sides to respeetjf British interests and the lives and property of British subjects* I am going to Dubai today to watch the situ ation closely and to discus other matters* - Britagent - v/ |04' Confidential * No.594/3/1.

Shaik Said^ second step was to come to some sort of understanding with his relatives directly without letting the Residency Agent know or mediate in their affairs. For this purpose he appointed the following neutral persons to act as a conciliation committee 1. Shaikh Mijrin bin Sultan. 2. Shaikh Said bin Bati bin Suhail. 3. Shaikh Jum*ah bin Abdullah bin Said. 4. Salim bin Musabbih bin Hamudah. 5. Muhammad bin Said al-Gandi. G^Ali bin Said bin f Atij* 7. Muhammad bin Bayat. 8 . Bayat bin Muhammad al-Mur. 3. The Committee crossed to Daira side on September 18th a.m. and met with the Albu Falasah Reform Party, whose leader was Shaikh Hashar bin Rashid in the absence of Shaikh Mani* bin Rashid at sea. The Committee told the Reform Party that Shaikh Said was willing to consider their demands provided they vacated the towers in their haxK \ mm *hands and discussed with him directly without the mediation of the Residency Agent. The Reform party replied that they were not prepared to vacate the towers until Shaikh Said demobilized his bedouin recruits and agreed to their demands through the Residency Agent. 4. On September 18th p*m. I proceeded to Dubai and reached there when the Committee had just returned from Daira and been conferring with Shaikh Said. Having acq uainted myself with the situation I called on Shaikh Said and asked him how things were going on . He replied that everything was all right. I tried to extract some inform ation from him, but he declined to disclose anything. I told him that I was aware of the situation, and was very glad to hear that he was trying to settle matters amicably with his relatives. I related to him what I knew and he confirmed it. He, further, informed me that the Committee was about to re-cross to Daira to meet the Reform Party. I asked him if I might know his last instructions to them, so that my information might not be one-sided, but he said that when I came to see him he was just interviewing them and had no time to give them any instructions. I knew that he was unwilling to tell me and did not press him further. I re-crossed to Daira. 5. In the meantime, besides the letter mentioned in my telegram referred to above, I have received 2 letters from the Reform Party, one dated 17th and the other 18th September. Copies, with translations, of the abovemention- ed 3 letters are enclosed herewith. My replies to them were verbal. Before leaving Dairah for Sharjah I left a verbal message to the Refozmi Party that if they could get a written undertaking in the form of an agreement by Shaikh Said to implement their demands, to be drawn in 2 copies, signed by both sides and attested by all the members of the Committee/-- 3 - //i Committee, they should accept it and not make my mediation an essential condition. 6 * As regards the contents of Shaikh Hashar bin Rashid 1 s third letter, the story given therein is exag gerated. The fact is that 3 persons of Shaikh Said’s men crossed with their arms to Daira side. They went to the bazaar where they were met by Shaikh Muhammad bin Ruraiz. The latter spoke nicely to them and told them that under the circumstances they should have not crossed wito. their fire arras • He advised them to return and they complied. I mentioned this to Shaikh Said when I called on him in the afternoon (18th September). He said that they went that side to get their arms repaired or cleaned ctiia that when ae came to know of the incident he renrimand— ed the persons responsible. 7* In the course of my conversation with him yesterday I noticed that his attitude was more friendly and more compromising than it had been on the 17th. Feelings on both sides also were not tense as they had oeen on that day. Good faith is however lacking on both sides, but the Committee nay succeed to reinstate this and bring about a suitable settlement. Before taking leave I assured Shaikh Said that although 1 did not want to interfere, I was always prepared to render my services if they were required in the settle ment of any differences. % Residency Agent, Sharjah.Translation of a letter dated the 2aik.Ha t Jab 1357, corresponding to the loth September 1938, from Hashar bin Rashid A1 Maktum, Dubai to the Residency Agent, Sharjah, I have to inform you that on Friday night (nigh - f • ■ -■ ' f.' ' ; •_ preceding Friday) the 21st Rajab (corresponding to the 15th September 1938) Rashid son of Shaikh Said bin Maktum sent men to occupy 'Nahar” tower on which people depend for their water supply. It was on account of' the intermediation of the British Governments officihl* . • /'f and in reliance on their orders that we acquiesced during the last interval. There is great agitation and therefore you are requested to come early to those who failed to observe the Great Governments orders. Lately we renounced these important places for no reason but the intermediation of the Residency Agent.

We have been awaiting your reply, or your presence to put an end to this situation, which threatens public peace, but have not received a reply from you, We hope that goodwill is the cause of delay. We request you to send us a reply as soon as possible, as we are bound to observe our previous undertaking to His Majesty’s Government, and cannot take action. We must inform you that the activities of Shaikh Said’s men have increased much this morning.

We asked you to put an end to this. This morning a few of them, crossed to Dairah, carrying their arms and going about in the bazaars and streets. This is inconsistent with the pledge and shows their bad faith. Their indention was to stir sedition. As yesterday when you returned to us from Shaikh Said bin Maktum you told us that you had quietened the sate, and asked us' to quieten the state on our side, we, depending on your word and out of respect to the Government 1 s orders, have not taken any inconsistent action, nor shall we do so in future. We would therefore request iron that upon receipt of this you will send them (ioe. Shaikh Said) a letter of warning to prevent them from such peace-breaking actions lest some thing may suddenly happen which affects British interests.

Since the news of Shaikh Said ! s visit to Abu Dhabi I have been trying to know the object. I am now in a position to report as follows. 3* Reliable sources confirm that Shaikh Said asked the help of Shaikh Shakhbut to put down the rising of the Al Bu Falasjfa in Dubai. Shaikh Shakhbut, it is said, replied that he was willing to help Shaikh Said, but he was not sure of His Majesty f s Govern ment’s attitude on his interference in Dubai affairs. Shaikh Said then requested Shaikh Shakhbut to accompany him to Dubai to act as a mediator between him and his relatives. What is known of Sheidkh Shakhbut’s reply to this proposal is that he also politely excused himself* But it is thought that there was a secret agreement between them to be brought into effect if circumstances allowed, and that with this object in view Shaikh Said in order to know the reaction of His Majesty’s Government as well as that of the Al Bu ■ f * i. i ( / / ; ; FalasKah twice propagated that Shaikh Shakhbut was coming: (a) (Signature) i 1 . . i when/- (Designation) S. 44.

The Al Bu Palasah’s reaction to yesterday’s rumour was that they sent a warning to Shaikh Said that Shaikh Shakhbut had ambitions in Dubai&gt; and that if he came to seize Shindiqah he may tsdca/tho opportunity to occupy it, especially as the new recruits on which Shaikh Said depended were of the Al Bu Falah, Shaikh Shakhbut f s tribe. In that case, they warned him, he will be the loser. Shaikh Said replied that Shaikh Shakhbut would not come to Dubai. 5. Shaikh Shakhbut may however sendhis brother Shaikh Hazza*, who is expected to have returned from Buraimi yester day. If he at all come to Dubai, he may come in company with Shaikh Sultan bin Saqr of Sharjah* If &gt; in this case, you ’want me to take any action please let me know.

Shaikh Sultan did not reply this letter, but at a meeting in Shaikh Saqr bin Sultan’s place after the conclusion of the truce between the Hu'aim and the Al Bu Shamis, Shaikh Sultan said, addressing Shaikh Saqpof Buraimi, that he (latter) should now make peace between him and Shaikh Rashid. Shaikh Saqr of Buraimi replied that that could easily be made if Shaikh Sultan recovered the slave from the Al Bu Shamis and restored it to Shaikh Rashid. Shaikh Sultan said that he hoped for the best. Next morning he sent word to Shaikh Rashid, say ing that if the latter himself could reach the Al Bu Shamis they would restore the slave to him. Shaikh Rashid declined to do so. He left Buraimi after having authorized Shaikh Saqr bin Sultan to negotiate with Shaikh Sultan bin Saqr on his behalf and accept the slave if she was returned. Although we were talking alone Shaikh Rashid bin Humaid was reserved and he seemed to be distressed. 5.

As regards Nahar tower, he said that Shaikh Said intended to send more men by motor cars that night to the said tower to reinforce its garrison, and that if he did send them, they (the Al Bu i^alasah) would prevent them by force, and would attack the tower itself. I told him that I could persuade Shaikh Said not to send any reinforcements to the tower, and warned him not to allow the Al Bu tfalasah take any offensive action. I, then, crossed to Shandiqah and saw Shaikh Said. I reminded him of his undertakings to me not to take the offensive, and told him that 1 heard that he intended to send reinforcements to Nahar tower by motor cars that night. He said that that was a mere rumour and assured me that no reinforcements will be sent. 3* Since that night all is quiet, but British and foreign subjects are afraid, and I have received three letters from them, which 1 enclose in original. In case of any fighting taking place, I propose to instruct each community to gather in one place, and to give each communi«ty a British/-a British flag to fly it on their place* I have got 3 flags here. If you have no objection to my proposal, please send me any old flags you can spare. 3# Kalba . Reference paragraph 6 of my memorandum No#611, dated 22nd September 1938. Yesterday I sent a letter by a special messenger to Shaikh Khalid of Kalba, asking him to send me details about his meeting with Shaikh Muhammad bin *Alx, thief of the fiani Kitab. I expect my messenger to return on 3rd October, but I may hear from him earlier, in which case I will let you know at once. 4# Sharjah-Ajman Relations . Negotiations are going on between the Shaikhs of these two places, and it is understood that Shaikh Sultan bin Saqr will agree to recover the slave from the •&amp;! Bu Shamis and restore it to Shaikh Rashid bin Kumaid, and to make peace between the latter two, if Shaikh Rashid wrote to him in this connection. The Slave should no doubt be sent to this Agency by either of the two Shaikhs, and I shall warn them of the fact. Offg# Residency Agent, Sharjah.Secret and Personal* Respected Sir, On the 27th September Shaikh Sultan bin Saqr of Sharjah called on me and in the course of our talk he mentioned the present situation in lAibai and said that the A 1 Bu Falasah have not been able to settle their differences, so far, and that one day they may fight on a town which is not their property, which concerned him much. When I asked his explanation, he said that Daira belonged to him and that he could prove his claim by documentary evidence. He, then, took out of his pocket an old document which he passed tojd me. The document was dated one century back and ran as follows:- 'Know you all who see these presents, of Muslim Rulers, Salaams, the Mercy of (fod and His Blessings be upon you, that this town of Daira, which has lately sprung up, has been built by order of Shaikh Sultan bin Saqr. It belongs to him and nobody can dispute his ownership of it. Whenever he wants it and lays his claim on it, he will meet no opposition from us. The town will be his town, and the people his people who will support his authority. 'Given by Maktum bin Bati, Jum , ah bin Said, Majid bin Dalmuk and Za f al Bin Shahin.

The situation is as before, and nothing of importance has taken place. Preparations are being made by both sides. Shaikh Said bin Bati bin Suhail, a member of the abortive Conciliation Committee, has joined tne Reform Party and has armed 40 of his crew. Pearl-fishing boats have now returned, and the Reform Party will increase their forces by the crew, who in most cases live on Daira side. The Ruler of Dubai on his part is cleaning his old guns and making new wheels for them. Humaid of *Ajman has written to Shaikh Sultan bin Saqr , Euler of Sharjah, requesting him to restore the slave to him and make peace between him and the Aibu Shamis. Shaikh Sultan has given 'wajh' (promise of peace) on behalf of the Albu Shamis, and has undertaken to restore the slave to Shaikh Rashid bin Humaid.

Both sides are not capable of settling their differences without the interference of His Majesty's Government. In my opinion pressure by His Majesty's Government on Shaikh Said is necessary and will end matters satisfactorily. 3.

Shaikh Said is now willing to accept the reform articles, but Awlad Rashid in order to ensure the articles being carried out demand the election of a Representative Assembly invested with executive powers. Therefore, I am of-the opinion that the two Shaikhs will not succeed in their endeavour, in which case it is the intention of Awlad Rashid to depose Shaikh Said. 3. In the event of the 2 parties resorting to arms it is presumed that Shakhbut will support Shaikh Said while Shaikh Muhammad will support Awlad Rashid. If this happens other Trucial Shaikhs, i.e. of Sharjah and of Has al Khaimah, will appear on the scene on Shaikh Said f s side. 4.

I did so as I considered that what displeases me will displease the Government. I have given them some of their demands such as freedom, and they considered the question of the Baladiyah and at last they decided to postpone it till the Qaffal. The town has been in peace since the olden days. I never agreed to grant them anything else. You have remarked that if anything happens to your subjects and to their property I should be responsible for it. There is no doubt about this. But 0* Sahib, I do request you to remove your subjects from my town, Dubai, because I fear they may receive any harm on account of (the mischievous action) of the sons of Rashid. As regards parties, undoubtedly my party is stronger than theirs. But I notice that nothing will cause a settlement between us except fighting. Should there be an outbreak of war bet ween us, it is obvious that the bullet will hit every tar get and if you do not remove all your subjects, I will no &gt; be responsible for them should any harm befall them as the trouble has been created by others and you are well aware of this fact. ‘ A .

According - to S^iaikh Sultan, he constructed this Murabba'ah vvith the object of protecting the Sharjah subjects who are residing at the east end, including the Al ‘Uwais family who recently left Kira and settled at Sharjah and also to guard against raids by bedouins and any attempt of invasion by an enemy. The Al f Uwais are pearl merchants who were not on good terms with Shaikh f Abdur Rahman and were encouraged by Shaikh Sultan to live at Sharjah. ^ • Shaikh *Abdur Rahman bin Muhammad returned from Bahrain by the down steamer on 4th January 1939. He sent a letter on 5th to the Sheikh of Sharjah objecting to the construction of this tower with copy to me. Shaikh l Abdur Rahman accused Shaikh Sultan of being uflder the influence of the Al , tfwais. That there was no necessity for this tower which faces Hire, unless he had bad intentions against Rira itself. From hj.s letter to Shaikh Sultan, it would appear that he had given /2 - © given Shaikh Sultan an ultimatum of his determined action if he failed to stop the work* The tower is only about six feet now* from Shaikh ^Ybdur Haiiman of Hira he sent it to me with his Secretary, 'Abdullah bin Karls, and asked my opinion* I said to the Shaikh 1 s Secretary that I was not prepared to give any opinion or make any comment on the subject, but that I HaLiiicJi would endeavour to settle thei^ differences direct by a peaceful and friendly spirit* man and would not hesitate to fight with the Shaikh of Sharjah ? , if the latter insisted on the work being carried out, I wrote know to both of them letting them/of their responsibilities about Biitish subjects and their property. This acted as a cooling doze and brought down the temperature of both of them* The Shaikh of Sharjah stopped the work on the tower at once and sent a letter to Shaikh 'Abdur Rahraan informing him of this and that he was sending his brother, Shaikh Majid, to see him at Hira in the evening* 6* Shaikh 'Abdur Bataan replied to my letter to the ex'fect that he would respect all British subjects and that his hostile attitude was directed against the .Shaikh of Sharjah and his a^jn subjects* 7 • Shaikh Majd went to Shaikh 'Abdur Rahman but with all the nice and flattery words, he failed to convince Shaikh 'Abdur Rahman to change his attitude. He was firm and resolved to use arms against the Shaikh of Sharjah if he did not give up the idea of building this tower. 8* Shaikh Sultan bin Saqr came to see me this morning. He said to me that he could not see the ground for 'Abdur Rahma 3. As soon as the Shaikh of Sharjah received the letter 4. As Shaikh 'Abdur Rahman bin Muhammad is a hot Headed protest /■■SI* protests which amounts to an interfex*ence with the Shaikh of Sharjah’s responsibilities# He said that if Shaikh ’Abdur Rahman did not change his attitude in a few days time, he was determin ed to continue the work without caring for the consequences.

I repeated what I had already said to his Secretary and avoided to make any remarks# 8# So far everything is normal and X do not think that Shaikh Sultan would drag himself into war with Shaikh ’Abdur Rahman# Should he be compelled by circumstances to do so, therr is a chance of losing his Shaikh-ship.

He said that he would take upon ^himself the trouble of convincing all the Shaikhs to enter into such agreement, but that he was not sure of his\success unless he was helped by the Residency Agent on behalf of the British Government. I said to the Shaikh that if other Shaikhs consider the agreement to be in their interests they would sign it without hesitation and there would be no necessity for the Residency Agent to take part in arranging it. I then asked the Shaikh to give me a copy in writing of his proposed agreement, so that I may forward it to you. On 16th January the Shaikh sent me a rough draft of the agreement which he wants to get all the Trucial Shaikhs to sign. 2. During your visit on 17th January I mentioned to you the Shaikh*s proposal and also gave you a copy of his rough draft in English and enclose herewith copy,in Arabic, for your record. 3.

The Shaikh said that the Shaikhs would not be afraid from each other but that a mere letter from the Governznnet woul bring the Shaikh responsible for breach of his undertaking to m his senses. I said that the letter from the Government could not have a force unless it smelt gun-powder (supported by force) and I could not see the ground why the British Government should take the place of the Shaikhs and face all difficulties in a matter which is purely in the interests of the Shaikhs. 4. The object of the Shaikh of Has al Khaimah is to get the rest of the Trucial shaikhs and the British Government to help him and his cousin, the Shaikh of Sharjah, against the bedouins who do not admit their authority.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000395_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/4/11</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000395</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/4/11</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 3/1 Local affairs'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1932/1939</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2016-02-17T11:23:49</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">ara</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">per</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (261 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the front to rear of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the main foliation sequence commences at the front cover with 1 and terminates at the back cover with 263; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.
