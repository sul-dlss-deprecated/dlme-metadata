The reports are organised as a series of bullet points representing the events of each day of the week. Of note are a series of regular standardised forms titled 'Statement of Arms and Ammunition landed at Muscat'.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Political events</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Oman</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Weapons</topic></subject><subject><topic>Arms control</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x00007d#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
