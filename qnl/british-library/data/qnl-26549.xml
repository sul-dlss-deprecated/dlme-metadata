We suggest that you should offer the following comments. (a) Politically the Hadhramaut (a rather imprecise geographical ter ) forms p« rt of the Aden Protectorate. It would be better therefore that the dotted line which on the map separates the Hadhramaut from 'Aden' should be deleted and that the words 'Aden Protectorate' should be written so as to extend across the whole area. (b) ihe term 'British hinterland of Aden'la not one that wo use nor do wo regard the dosort area so Indicated on the map as more connected with the Aden Protectorate t^n wltn the dominions of the Multan of Oman. The dividing point between the Protectorate and the Sultanate on the coast is at approximately the point shewn on the map* Ho dividing line h^a been defined inland. e would suggest that the words 'British Hinterland of Aden' and the dotted line separating the area so described from Oman should botn be deleted* (e) The map might with advantage show the accepted boundaries between Trucial Oman on the one hand and the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman on the other, They are as follows: (1) the Busandam Peninsula belongs to the above-mentioned Sultanate as far south as a line di e Persian ■^4^, Oulr toi^pibba on the Gulf of Oman, (ii) From that point southwards the coast on the Gulf of Oman is reckoned as belonging to Trucial Oman as far as KTior Kalba, an)/® (n&gt; (ill) irom tnence a lino should be dru.*- curvlnfr into the desert in a south-westerly direction and then terminating* South and south-east of that line lies Oman proper. 4nd Koweit, which are variously tinted on the Society's map, you could explain to the Secretary that they are all of them Independent with His Majesty's Government and should consequently logically receive uniform treatment as regards their colour on the map. amended, and the Koweit-iNejd neutral zone inserte&lt; the Row( (the te: accessil ” Treat i&lt; page 21. 5.

The peace treaty just concluded may define the joint frontier more precisely. But in any case the Yemen on the east is simply bounded by the desert and no line has been laid down. die line shown on the map as dividing the Yemen from the Aden Protectorate appears correctly to represent the present boundary, as laid down in the Anglo Turkish convention of 1914; but here again, as the line runs out into the desert, it has never(NDEXED 6T FORKIGH OFFICK, S.W.l. ZA7Q 23rd May, 1934. (K 2763/1437/25) 1 1954 My dear Gilbert, I am sorry to nave been so long in replying \,o your letter P.Z.2707/34 of 30tn April about tbe maps of Arabia, snowing tbe various boundaries, Wuicn are required by Army Headquarters, India, and Air Headquarters, Bagdad. 2. In tne first place I agree that tne map for Army headquarters, India, should certainly be sent tnrougn one India Office. In tne circumstances it may pernaps be well to send tnat required for Air Headquarters, Bagdad, tnrougn tne Air Ministry. If several copies are to be made mignt it not be as well to take tne opportunity to nave copies made for our own use (India Office and Foreign Office) and for tne Embassy at Bagdad and the Legation at Jedda. It is perhaps for consideration whether it might not be as well to have twenty or thirty copies of the map printed by tne War Office for confidential/&amp; &gt;v confidential official use. We do not, novever, want to nold up matters muck longer, as tke original request for the map was made last November, and in tkese circumstances there may be some advantage in making a few copies by hand without further delay. 3. The next point is tne question of the map to be used. The 1:4,000,000 map wuich was originally produced in order tnat the boundaries might be marked on it, seems bo me to be on much too small a scale to be of much practical use, quite apart from the fact that it leaves out the whole of the Eastern end of Arabia. I should have thought myself that it would have been much better, if we are to have a single map of the whole of Arabia, to use Captain F, F. hunter^ Survey of India Map of 1908 (corrected to 1914 - or later, if there is a later edition) on the scale of one inch to 32 miles, of which, as you know, I nave a copy hanging up in my room. I am inclined to think that this map is more accurate than the small 1:4,000,000 map of Western Arabia, and it should be much easier accurately to show the/5 ./ K trie relevanii boundaries on iu. If iii is used, however, I tnink it» might be convenient to emphasise some of the features and names on it, as it is rather faintly printed and the names are almost microscopic. On my own copy I nave uad the coast-line outlined in blue and all the important names written in in larger type, which I have found very convenient if one is looking for a place in a nurry. 4, I quite agree about underlining or colouring the various Persian Gulf islands wnicn we consider to be the property of the various Arab rulers; and also about marking the Kuria Muria islands, and also Perim, Sokotra, the Aden Settlement and other British possessions in red. It is important, however, not to mark Kamaran in red as has inadvertently been done on certain previous occasions. There should now be no distinction between the Aden Protectorate and hadramaut, I quite agree that it would be well to alter the coast line at the nead of the Donat-es-Salwa to correspond to our latest information. This will be easy if tne coast-line is outlined as I have^ suggested.5. I do not tnink taere would be mucn to be gained by marking tbe air routes. Some of tnem are still uncertain and tney are all liable to cnange. I tnink one map attacned to p,G*13 snowing tne air routes nas now become less useful tban it would nave been if tne air routes nad not been so conspicuously marked on it. It would be well, however, to make sure tnat every point and place connected witn tne air routes was conspicuously marked, so as to be easy to locate at a glance. 6. I tnink we can probably arrange to nave all tne necessary frontiers marked on tne map witnout great difficulty, witn the exception of the frontier between Saudi Arabia and the Yemen. As regards tnis, pernaps tne best plan for tne present will be oo stick to tne de facto line of 1931, beginning at tne Wadi xassnar just nortn of Midi, and tnence running sligntly nortn of east inland and sweeping nortnwards so as to leave tne Jebel Arwa and Saada well witnin Yemeni territory. It could end just to tne west of Nejran. A lignt dotted/dotoed line would -be enougn and could “be described as tne approximate de facto boundary from 1931 to 1934. 7. I quite agree Uiau tne boundary between Qat,ar and Abu Dabi nad better be snown by a snort line running west or south-west from the nortnern corner of tne Knor al Odeid. It could begin bending souui insnore of tne inlet. 8. I unink; it would probably be well ^nat tne map snould still contain something like Ryan's suggested warning label&gt; but as it will* in tact, wnen it is finished, be very like tne map nanging up on tne wall of my room, witn wnicn tne diplomatic representatives of most of tne countries concerned are tnorougnly familiar, I do not tnink tnat mucn serious narm would be done if it fell into unauthorised hands, provided it could not be quoted against us as authoritative evidence about the position of any of tne frontiers concerned. 9. When you have considered these various points, pernaps you would let me know and we can then arrange to discuss matters witn tne War Oflice or our various map experts/experts witU a view to completing tHe preparation of ttie necessary maps, and getting tnem sent out, at least to India and Bagdad, without furtner delay.

INDIA OFFICE 2. I agree in tire first place with the suggestions made as regards any such map in paras. 2, 3&amp;4of Warner's letter of 10th April, 2.1818/1437/25. I also agree that the map when compiled should be sent to Army Headquarters, India through the India Office,(it might indeed have been more convenient if the original enquiry had been made through the F.&amp; P. Dept, and the India Office). 3. I agree also witn wnat you say in paras.4, o and 6 of your letter of 23ru April referred to above. 4. The only supplementary suggestions I have to make are the following: (a) If we are going to compile a map for confidential use showing the various Arabian frontiers, there is a great deal to be said for having a map which will cover the whole of Arabia, Including Transjordan and Palestine.

(c) One does not want to overload the map with detail, otherwise there might have been something to be said for an indication (especially as its interest will be to some extent strategic) of the line of tne civil and strategic air routes on the ^rab littoral of the Persian Gulf ana of tne strategic air route which has now been out sketched/by the Air Ministry and which runs via 3ur and Lasira Islands down * to Aden3 Draft Paper.

(d) 7/e might in the case of (^atar, nark the south-eastern boundary hy a line running a very short aistance inland aue west from the north of tne rihor-al-Odeid, in view’ of the fact that a line at such a point has previously been recognised by us as the boundary between Abu Qnabi ana ^atar. 5. I am not quite clear whether it i§ proposed that a warning label, possibly in the terms suggested by Ayan, will still be appended to the map. In view of tne rather aelicate situation in regard to certain of the frontiers concerned this seems desirable. J.

The greater part of this record is of course irrelevant to the present issue, but it contains some useful material in connexion with the errors which have now been discovered in the 1916 and 1918 1:1,000,000 maps, 3, You will see in particular that we took the view that the western end of the Iraq-Nejd frontier as laid down in the Protocol of Uqair must be regarded as determined by the physical feature mentioned in the •OPY SENT BY AIR MmIl. of v/)-/» £ Protocol, J,G. Laithwaite, Esq. ) J enclosure In WEEKLY LEITEh NO. 18. 1 3 from secretary, political and kroner i.EPT. INDIA OFFICEProtocol, i*e. the summit of the Jebel Anaiza, and not 'by the geographical co-ordinates, which were added merely as a supplementary description hut were not given as the basis of the definition. 4. This being so, it is clear that we must regard the north-eastern end of the Transnordan-Nejd frontier, as laid down by the Hadda agreement, as starting from the western point of the Iraq-Nejd frontier as determined by the true 73 Qsition of the physical features , and not as laid down by the true geographical co-ordinates. This is a very important point, in view of the discrepancies which have now been found to exist between the true position of the physical features and the true geographical co-ordinates all along the Transjordan-Nejd frontier. As you know, our view is that that frontier must be plotted in the light of the map used and referred to by the negotiators, and that it must therefore lie in the same relationship to the true physical features as it would if that map had been correct. This means that the description by geographical co-ordinates as given in the Hadda agreement willwill v/herever necessary have to he ignored, I think, however, that you already have all the relevant correspondence on this point. 5. As regards the Trans^ordan-Hejaz frontier, i.e. the east and west line from the Gulf of Aqaba to approximately meridian 38 east, the western end is of course fixed by geographical features, and the eastern end depends on the termination of the Transjordan-Nejd frontier as laid down in the Hadda agreement, which in turn depends on the Protocol of Uqair, and as explained above, must be read in the light of the physical features as shown on the 1918 map. 6. We have already discussed orally various other points connected with Ryan’s memorandum, and I would only add that of course the 1913/1914 frontier from the Persian Gulf to the Aden Protectorate must be regarded as still holding good, and that in view of this there can naturally be no question of showing any 'frontier” of Qatar as running across the base of the Qatar peninsula. You will no doubt take all thesethese considerations into account when you eventually let us have your reply. Yours ever,jr — MSfi£L.HAK DU M».

The difficulty orlses out of the apparent IncomfratibiUlty »f the-4efi«it4oflS of the Eastern and of TransJordan-JJejd and of the Western end of Iraq-Nejd frontiers contained in Article 1 of the Hadda Agreement and Article 1 (d) of the Uoair Protocol respectively. 3. The Foreign Office view was as follows:- The Uqalr Protocol, signed on Decanber 2nd, 1922, fixed the termination of the Iraq-Nejd frontier at “ the'■jefrel A-nazft. In the neighbourhood of the intersection of ment of November 2nd, 1925, fixed the beginning of the Tmnsjordan-Nejd frontier at the point of intersection of meridian 39° E., and parallel 32° N. 'which marks the The negotiators of the Hadda Agreement clearly intended that the beginning of the Transjordan-Nejd frontier should coincide with the end of the Iraq-Nejd frontier as defined in the Uqair Protocol, since the former frontier is expressly stated to begin at 'the point 'which marks the termination of the frontier between 'Nejd and Iraq'. The negotiators evidently considered the Jebel Anaza and the intersection of 39° E., and on the 1 ,UOO ,000 map^ the rr _ , ‘ed to in the Hadda Agreement. In actual fact they are not coincident, the Jebel .Anaza being an unknown distance further N.E. 4. The definition in the Hadda Agreement must therefore be regarded as an attempt to reproduce, as far as the point of junction was concerned, the definition Egfsrled %3 the Ji aslc document . 5. It followed that the 3. end of the Transjordan- Iraq frontier must be fixed in the light of the Uqair Protocol rather than the Hadda Agreement, in so far as the two were incompatible, more esoecially as it is clear that the Hadda 4ereement merely gives the geographical co ordinates in order to define more clearly a point of “meridian 39° E. and parallel 32° N.' The Hadda Agree trtf&amp;r of t he fron ti er bttw e en Nejd and I raq*. 32° N. as coincident, seeing ihat they are shown as such than shown on the 1,000,000 map. in the Uqair Protocol, and tM latter agre be. which3. which the essential definitiori i« H the termixiation of 'the ejd frontier*. 6. The following formula wae therefore at first suggested. *The Ire^-Transjordnn frontier begins in *the south at the point where the Iraq-Nejd frontier terminates ae laid down in the Uqair Protocol*. 7. This, however, aa Mr* BeCi.ctt pointed out, was open to objection in that it refen^ed to one of the two agreements only; to do so might lead to questions as to the other, and so rai«e^ the issue of the incompatibility of the two. The best course, in Mr. Beckett's view, was to refer to no agreement at all; if that were not possiblf to refer to both, and if questions arose as to their in compatibility, we could maintain our contention that they can be reconciled on the lines of paragraph 3 above. 8. After further discussion however the following formula was agreed upon: *The Iraa*TranaJordan frontier * starts in the south at the point of junction of the *Iraq-Nejd frontier and the Imo-Transjordan frontier.....* (2) .ife H AtUgA ■ flX-JiQrt.fteni ml... 9. The High Conroisnioners for Iraq and Transjordan bad both recommended the following formula: '/^Fhe frontier 'endflZ at the Jebel Tenf or the nearest point thereto on 'the boundary between Iraq and Oyrla as ultimately de- 'limited*. 10. Two leading objectiona were ween to this formula: (a) The War office considered it desirable to indicate Bome exact physical feature, e.g. the highest point of the Jebel Tenf. (b) Mr. Rendel pointed out the desirability of expressing in some way the fact that the southern frontier of &gt;yrla with Transjordan and Iraq was continuous, l.e., mentioning the Transjordan* Tyria frontier as well as the Iraq-fyrlA frontier.4. 11. To meet these two objections the following formula was finally adopted: 'ZThe frontier/ ends in 'the north at the nearest point to the summit of the •Jebel-Tenf on the boundary between Iraq and 5yria and 'Syria and Transjordan as ultimately delimited'. 12. The stage now reached was that the definition of a southern and a northern terminal for the frontier had been agreed upon. The question then arose how the line Joining the two terminals should be defined. 13. The suotgestion of the two High Commissioners was that the line should be stated to follow the water shed. But apart from possible difficulties in ascer taining where this lay, it would prove difficult to make this definition fit in with the definitions already agreed on for the two terminals. 14. It was first suggested that we might simply speak of 'a straight line between these two terminals’. Mr. Hertdel mentioned two possible objections to such a definition: (1) An absolutely 'straight line* which could not be varied in delimitation to corres pond to small physical features etc. was apt to lead to difficulties by cutting across canping grounds, natural features etc. (2) Colonel Cox and 3ir A. ■ aucnoua had emphasised in private conversation with him the im portance, in the interest of the needs of the Inhabitants, of laying down a practical frontier, i.a. not a theoretical straight line, but one drawn in accordance with ohyaical features. 15. The position was that no exact physical features were at present known by which the line could be defined, but at the same time, for the reasons mentioned above....to..«•. 5. above, it wan desirable that tbe eventual delimitation of the frontier ahould follow well-defined physical features wherever they actaally existed. 16. Mr. Rendel therefor© su 3 ge?*ted that the frontier should be defined as, generally speaking, a straight line, with latitude for the delimitators to vary from the rtnrfgbt line within certain limits in order tc take physical features into account. 17. On this ba^is the following formula for the middle portion of the frontier was worked out by Mr. Beckett; 'Between these two terminal points the 'frontier follows where possible prominent physical •features, provided that it shall not diverge more than “five kilometres from a straight line between these 'two terminal points*. 18. distance of five kilometres was adopted on the advice of the War Office/ 7 . 19. The text of the complete formula, as evolved at the meeting, is attached as an annex to this note. (At this point the War Office representatives left). WO. The next question considered ms the form of instrument in which the line should be embodied. 21. Mr. Rendel considered that any declaration respecting the frontier should take the form of a restatement of an already existing line. It was essential to avoid the impres«ion that a-a entirely new frontier was being laid down. There was In existence a line agreed on for administrative purpose® in 1926. It would however be danseroue to hinge the new frontier specifical- ly on to this line, as it might be argued that the * present line give? teka territory to Iraq and moreto TrtmsjoixSan tlmn did the 1926 line^ l^oreover the 1936 arrangement v®,e technically somewhat irregular and would not Itself bear very close scrutiny. It was therefore preferable to omit any specific reference to the 1 j 26 line, but merely to apeak In general terms of “the existing frontier'. 22. These views found general approval, and it mn agreed that any eventual announcement about the frontier should borin somewhat on the following lines: 14 As it has been found desirable to define more precisely 'the existing frontier between Transjordan and Iraq, 'the following detailed definition i&lt;? now proposed and 'accepted*. 23. Ac to the modalities of the announcement, it was desirable that the arrangement should be as un obtrusive ae possible, in order to avoid giving the impression at Geneva that a nex frontier was being de vised, Moreover aiiything In the nature of a formal agreement would need ratification in the Iraq Parliament, which would inevitably lead to publicity, and to the risk of a false impression being created at Geneva. It was suggested that the simplest way would be an exchange of notes between the Iraq and Transjordan Governments. 24, At the sme time it wao essential that any settlement should not leave unexpressed the responsibili ties which His Majesty's Government as Mandatory hold in respect of Transjordan's foreign relations, and the question arose how the approval of His Majesty’s Govern ment for Transjordan*s action siiould be expressed under the arrangement proposed. After considerable discussion the7 the following procedure wae eventually agreed upon: 25. (1) A note from the Iraqi Prime Minister to the TranrJordan Chief ^inieter, putting forward the pro posal # ae in paragraph 22 ahcve f on hehalf of the Iraqi Government, Minister to the High CeBmi^alorer for Transjordan, recit ing the proposal and asking for the approval of Hie Majesty's Government. Tranejordan to the Transjordan Chief Minister in reply to (2), conveying the approval of the Mandatory Power. taking note of and accepting the proposal in No.(l) on fcehalC of the Tmnejordan Government. 26. It was agreed that there was a reasonable prospect that a settlement on the above linen would safe guard Iraq's position in the event of questions at Geneva In regard to the definitiveness of her frontiers. Nuri Pasha, if questioned* would be able to produce the ex change of notes, the wording of which wo ly designed to aVo Id Ahe danger of- awkwa 37. After Iraq was safely in the League it was for consideration whether some more definite form of proce dure might not he desirable. In the meantime there was no need to look further ahead; the settlement would be automatically brought to the notice of the Pennanent Mandates Commission in 1933 by the printing of its text in the Annual Report on Pal estine and Transjordan for 1932.

It ms eventually decided that the best course would be to rs-affirm the existing frontier In an exchange of notes between Iraq and Koweit, follow- inn the procedure agreed upon in the cane o r Iraq and Transjordan. 31. The Colonial Office thought there vies no need to anticipate dif 'iculV in getting Iraq to accept such an annngGment. 33, Mr. Rendel pointed out that (though it was really ap India Office point) , it ms Important* from the point of view of Anglo*Koweiti relations tlsat any rruch arrangement between Koweit and Iraq should be approved by the Political Agent.

I also send you one of the two copies of the map enclosed in the Bagdad Chancery letter. 2. So far as I can see, Ryan’s memorandum of the 13th February embodies all the knowledge we have at present about their frontiers, but with reference to paragraph 4 o r the Busnire chancery letter of the 22nd December to Jedda and paragraph 5 of Ryan’s memorandum, we propose to explain to Bagdad that an examination of the question of the boundary of Qatar is now proceeding and that the important boundary in the sou. th-east tfr ■ •Onr- L&amp;4 thwa i-te $ Eeqv c m oi noiioc i■ i \ ENCLOSURE 11 \ ~&gt; No. 15 FROM SeCRFTA 1 Y, I . SECRE 1 L Er I. INbiA Oi i iiiE \south-east of Arabic 0 is the 1914 line, which His Majesty’s Government regard as the limit of Saudi territory in that region. Neither of the lines across the base or the Qatar peninsula should appear on the map, as we are making a point of the Sheikhdom’s not being necessarily coterminous with the peninsula. Also the two boundaries laid down by the 1914 Convention should not be marked ’’Uncertain” but boldly labelled ’’Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1914, Article III”. 3. Also, if dates are to be appended to each of the frontiers, it might be well to label the Iraq-Koweit frontier ’’April 19, 1923”, and the Koweit Neutral Zone and Koweit-Nejd boundaries, ”Koweit-Nej . Boundary ’’Convention, December 2, 1922”. 4. Although they do not affect the map, there are one or two points in paragraph 5 of the Bushire chancery letter which, so far as our information here goes, are not quite accurate. It is stated in that paragraph that Ras Sajar is the dividing point between the territory under the political control of Aden and the territory of Muscat. Surely Ras Dharbat Ali is that point, as indicatedindicated by the Government of India to the Resident in their letter No. F 719-N/31 of the 24th July, 1933, a copy of which was enclosed in your official letter No. P. Z. 4963/33 of the 15th August, 1933, to us. In the same paragraph it is stated that the Truc'al Coast extends from Abu Dhabi to Khassab. I take it that the Abu Dhabi referred to is not the town but the Sheikhdom, which, as we now know, extends westward along the coast as far as Khor el Odeid. Also, even assuming that Khassab is the northern limit of the Trucial Coast on the Persian Gulf side, os being the frontier town of the Sheikh of Ruus al Jibal, who is a dependent of the Sultan of Muscat, there remains a short stretch of coast on the Gulf of Oman, roughly from Sai’ah to Khor Kalba, which is not under Muscat. The Sultan’s dominions cannot therefore be said to extend from Khassab to the boundaries of the Hadhramaut. 5. Vi11 you let me know whether you have any further observations on the map? As soon as we get yourIJ cA your reply', we will make the necessary number of copies of the map for distribution. Do you agree to Bagdad’s proposal that Army Headquarters, India, should receive their copy through your Deuartment? 1 /COPY. (*n) (E 1437/1437/25) No.404/209/3. CONFIDENTIAL. British ] Jedda, Saudi Arabia. 13th February, 1934. My dear George, While I was on leave the Legation received from Bagdad two copies of a map of Arabia with a request that we should mark on them the national and provincial boundaries of Saudi Arabia. My Chancery were asked to forward one copy to Army Head Quarters India and to send the other back to the Embassy for return to Air Head Quarters Hinaidi, who had started the ball rolling in Bagdad at the instance of Army Head Quarters, India. difficult questions arise in connexion with this apparently simple matter. It was possible with the assistance of Bushire to mark various boundaries on the maps but most of them are the subjects of actual or potential controversy. I final result so far as we are concerned. You will see that I have suggested that it might be better to get your views before passing the maps on even with the precautions we have indicated. The slips pasted on to the actual maps read as follows: 'The boundaries £iown on this map are approximate only. The political questions connected with them are numerous and difficult. The map as marked should therefore be regarded as a strictly confidential document and should be considered It was not realised at the outset here how many send you copies of a letter and two enclosures showing the in G. W. Rendel, Esq., C.M.G., Foreign Office.in the light of the equally confidential memorandum enclosed in Jedda Chancery note to Bagdad No.405/209/4 of the 13th February 1934. Yours ever, (Signed) Andrew Ryan.COPY. No. 405/209/4. CONFIDENTIAL. Dear Chancery, British Legation, J edda. 13th February, 1934. Please see the correspondence ending with our chancery note No.3550/644/10 of Decemher 30 regarding the maps on which we were asked to mark the national and provincial boundaries of Saudi Arabia. Bushire elected to send both maps back to us with a letter of which a copy is enclosed. We think that 1923 in paragraph 3 is a slip for 1922. In the meanwhile the Minister had, on his return from leave, drawn attention to the possible dangers of marking boundaries, so many of which are the subject of actual or potential controversy, without taking special measures to ensure the maps being treated as highly confidential documents. We now send you both the maps for disposal, with a slip attached to each making them confidential and three copies of a memorandum explaining succinctly the position as regards the various frontiers and the reasons for caution. We leave you t o judge whether the maps can be safely passed on to Army Head Quarters India and R.A.F. Hinaidi with copies of the memorandum. The Minister asks us to say, however, that in his own opinion it would be preferable to make sure that the Foreign Office have no objection, as they are so greatly concerned in the political questions connected with the frontiers and have a wider knowledge than we of at least some of the issues. We enclose a copy of a letter he has written to Rendel. The Chancery, British Embassy, Bagdad. WeWe are sending copies of this letter and the memorandum to Bushire as well as to the Eastern Department. As no further copies of the particular map are available, we should still like, if possible, to have one in due course with the markings reproduced. The Eastern Department and Bushire might also like copies. Yours ever, CHANCERY.COPY. Confidential. No.1965-S of 1933. The Residency, Bushire. 22nd December, 1933. Dear Chancery, Please refer to your 3157/644/6 dated the 14th November 1933. We return the two maps of Arabia completed to the best of our ability. 2. The history of the ’Iraq-Kuwait frontier is as follows: The Kuwait frontiers were laid down in the Anglo- Turkish Agreement of 29th July 1913. This Agreement was never ratified, but in 1923 the Sheykh of Kuwait was informed that His Majesty’s Government recognised the frontier claimed by him between ’Iraq and Kuwait. This frontier is indicated in green on Map II annexed, to the Historical Summary of Events for the Period 1907-1928 (P.G.13) which was prepared in 1928 for the Persian Gulf Sub-Committee of the Commitee of Imperial Defence. In 1932, when ’Iraq was applying for membership of the League of Nations, it was decided that it would be as well to define its frontiers with bordering States. With this object in view the ’Iraq-Kuwait frontier as recognised by His Majesty’s Government was re-affirmed in an exchange of notes between the ’Iraq Government and the Sheykh of Kuwait. For the convenience of reference the definition of the frontier is given below. 'From the intersection of the Wadi el Audja with the Batin and thence northwards along the Batin to a point just south of the latitude of Safwan; thence eastwards passing south of Safwan wells, Jebel Sanam and Um Qasr leaving them to ’ Iraq’Iraq and so on to the Junction of the Khor Zobeir with the Khor Abdullah. The Islands of Warbah, Bubiyan, Maskan (or MashJan), Failakah, Auhah, Kubbar, Qaru and Umm el Maradin appertain to Kuwait.” 3. As regards the Kuwait-Nejd Boundary and Neutral Zone. This was laid down at the OJair Conference in 1923 and still holds good. 4. We have marked two alternative boundaries for Qatar, the reason being that the matter is still being discussed, and although it is most probable that one of the two will eventually be decided upon, we are not yet in a position to say which. 5. We are unable to mark the boundaries of the Trucial Coast, as this area is not included in the maps. Roughly speaking, however, we can say that the Trucial Coast, excluding Qatar, begins at Abu Dhabi and ends at Khassab, where Muscat territory begins and in turn extends as far as Has Sajar, where territory under the Political control of Aden commences. The inter-State boundaries of the Trucial Coast Sheykhdoms are vague, and there is, as far as we know, no line laid down dividing Ibn Saud T s territories on the south and south-east from those of Muscat and the Trucial Coast Sheykhdoms. We notice that you have not marked the boundary of a so-called ’Iraq-Nejd Neutral Zone. This we have filled in roughly in pencil from a map which we have here but of course you are in a better position to say whether it is correct or not than we are. Yours ever. RESIDENCY.VERY CONFIDENTIAL. X MEMORANDU^L pn the FRONTIBR3 SAUDI ARABIA , to accompany two marked copies of the 1/4,000,000 map published at the Survey of Egypt for the Arab Bureau, September, 1916. *Iraq-Saudi/Arabia. The frontier and the neutral zone at one part of it are defined by a Protocol signed at 'Uqair on December 2, 1922. It has not been delimited and disputes have arisen as to how certain places lie with regard to it. Trans-Jordan/Saudi Arabia. (a) The frontier between Trans-Jordan and Nejd is defined in Article 1 of the Hadda Agreement of November 2, 1925. It has not been delimited. Grave doubts have arisen as to the accuracy of the map referred to in the Agreement and the question of the effects of this is now under consideration in London. It is most important that nothing on the subject should be disclosed until further notice to the Saudi Government, who are already disposed to claim certain places which are also claimed by Trans-Jordan. (b) The frontier between Trans-Jordan and the Hejaz is a de facto frontier only. The present position is determined by Letters (l) and (2; attached to the Treaty of Jedda of May 20, 1927. Apart from the possibility that the question of the status of the Aqaba and ola’an districts may be reopened at some time by the Saudi Government, the frontier is affected by doubts analogous to those at (a) owing to the inaccuracy of the maps used. 3. Yemen and Saudi Arabia. There is no agreed frontier. The question of frontiers has long been the subject of dispute and the dispute has now reached a very acute stage. The dotted line in the markedmarked map gives a very rough idea of how the de facto frontier may lie. Even this is subject to the following observations:- (a) Coastal area. de facto frontier is believed to abut on the sea at Muwassim, a place about 5 miles north of Medi. The general trend inland may be said to be north-easterly but the direction at any given point cannot be indicated. (b) Mountain area. This has recently come into the forefront of the dispute between Ibn Saud and the Imfim. The geography, the tribal distribution and the extent of the effective authority of the rulers are all too uncertain to admit at present of a definition. (c) Najr&amp;n. This area is claimed in principle by both rulers and has played a large part in the dispute. The geography is, if possible, more uncertain than in other remote parts of Arabia and it is impossible to indicate a frontier in a region where the local tribes have probably held their own against all comers except for fleeting occupations. 4. Internal boundaries in the South-West of Saudi Arabia. Owing to the dispute between Ibn Saud and the Imam, the other boundaries of ! Asir still have some international importance. The northern boundary is in the region of the dotted line but is uncertain. The more important boundary between the former territory of the Idrisi (Tihamat f Asir) and what the Saudis now call ’Aslr Surat (capital at Abha) was laid down at least in part in a treaty between Ibn Saud and the then Idrisi in 1920, but the terms of this treaty have never been disclosed.5 • Boundaries ~between Sa udi Arabia on the one hand and the Aden Protectorate, the Sultanate of I/uscat and the Trucial Sheykhdoms on the other, r This 'boundary is indeterminate. ' Bushire has indicated two possihie frontiers for Qatar for reasons given in the Residency letter of December 22, 1933. Still more recent correspondence has shown (a) that there are other possible variants and (b) that the frontier of Qatar is not necessarily a frontier between it and Saudi Arabia. The question turns partly on the present effect of an Anglo- Turkish convention which was signed on July 29, 1913 but was not ratified. It determined the boundary of the Ottoman sanjak of Nejd, as shown by a blue line on an annexed map. , The Legation in Jedda has no copy of this convention. The line is thought to lie as shown in blue on the present maps. Its importance is that His Majesty’s Government might take their stand on it, if occasion arose, as determining the South East boundary of Saudi Arabia, even though they did not claim that the various states in their sphere of influence extended up to it. There might conceivably be at least one No Man’s Land. 6. Saudi Arabia, Kuwait Neutral Zone and Kuwait. These boundaries are laid down by one of the Protocols signed at Uqair on December 2, 1922. The Residency at Bushire has indicated them on the map. The Neutral Zone has recently been surveyed by the Royal Air Force but there has been no agreed delimitation as between the Sheykh of Kuwait and Ibn Saud. 7. Internal provincial boundaries in Saudi Arabia. Apart from what is stated at 4 above and the rough indication on the maps of what is understood to have been the boundary between the Hejaz and Nejd and its Dependencies when they were separate, no information is available on this subject.

Their attention would be fully drawn to the confidential nature of the maps by the warning notes and memoranda attached to them by Jedda. But we feel that it is for you to take the actual decision in the matter. to their owners, we should like to suggest that the one belonging to Army Headquarters, India might be sent back through the India Office. Air Headquarters could receive their map through us, unless you preferred to do it through the Air Ministry. We do not feel competent to decide whether the Our own feeling is that there should be no objection If you see no objection to the maps being returned As regards the last paragraph of Jedda Chancery f s letter under reference, we suggest that the necessary additional Eastern Department, Foreign Office.additional copies could t)e most easily prepared in the Foreign Office and distributed by you. If Jedda and Bushire are to have copies perhaps we too might be included in the distribution, since the boundaries of the Sa'udi Kingdom are of direct importance to this post.

The correspondence discusses the difficulties associated with marking out the various boundaries, owing to the fact that many of them are 'the subject of actual or potential controversy'. Also discussed are recommended revisions to the boundaries of Arabia, as shown on a National Geographic Society map of Asia (map not included).Notable correspondents include the following: His Majesty's Minister at Jedda (Sir Andrew Ryan); officials of the Foreign Office, the India Office, the Persian Gulf Political Residency, the British Embassy in Baghdad, and the British Library of Information in New York.In addition to correspondence the file includes the following:A copy of a memorandum dated 18 April 1932, which recounts an interdepartmental conference held at the Colonial Office three days earlier, concerning the submission of the frontiers of the mandated territories (namely the Iraq-Transjordan frontier, the Iraq-Kuwait frontier, and the Palestine-Syria frontier) for approval to the Council of the League of Nations.Two maps: one depicting the Arabian Peninsula and the other showing the eastern portion of the Aden Protectorate.Whilst the date range of the file is 1916-1934, only two items (including the aforementioned memorandum) date from earlier than 1934.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year.
