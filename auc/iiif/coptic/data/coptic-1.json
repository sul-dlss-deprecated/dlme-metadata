It contains 15 essays that begin with numbers 16 - 30. It consists of laudatory doctrinal essays and sermons written by the Coptic Church Fathers in the fourth century CE, paying tribute to St. Gregory of Nazianzus (circa 330-90 C.E.), the theologian, who was Bishop of Constantinople from 379 to 381 C.E. This manuscript is the first Arabic translation from the Greek manuscript written by St. Gregory of Nazianzen to the priest Claudianus (d. circa 404 C.E.). It was a counter argument to Apollinaris of Laodicea's (circa 315-390 C.E.) doctrine on the nature of Christ. Apollinaris reasoned that God's human nature is incomplete, as it lacks human reasoning. Apollinaris opposed Arianism and was a pro-Nicene.", "name": "Apollinaris, Bishop of Laodicea; Claudianus", "subject-lcsh": "Coptic church; Liturgy", "date-created": "1787-07-03", "type": "Still Image", "format": "image/jp2", "extent": "24 x 33.5 cm.; 234 p.", "medium": "manuscripts (document genre)", "language": "Arabic", "identifier": "SC-2003-01-01-01-6", "collection": "Iryan Moftah Coptic Language and Religion Manuscripts", "source": "<span>From: <a href=\"http://digitalcollections.aucegypt.edu/digital/collection/p15795coll4/id/238\">Volume II from Maiamer by Our Holy Father Saint Gregory of Nazianzus</a></span>", "license": "Copyright 2013, American University in Cairo.
