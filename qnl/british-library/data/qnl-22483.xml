Annual quotas fdr imports of consumer goods to Kuwait, Bahrain, Dubai, Muscat and Gwadur have been fixed as under with effect from 1st January, 1947.

The quotas mentioned above are for the confidential information of the political Agents concerned and they should arrange to allot exchange recommendations on as wide a basis as possible within these overall - limits. The quota of Swedish Kroner for Kuwait has been fixed taking into account request made in your telegram No. 4/51, January 18th. If quotas now allotted are found to be insufficient the matter should be represented to the Government of India. 3. Applications for exchange for imports from the above mentioned countries should be made to political Agents by importers either direct or through their bankers, together with the appropriate documentary evidence to show that the applications are bonafide. ' When political Agents are satisfied that the /applications....- 2 - &gt; applications are genuine and are within the quotas allotted, they should issue Recommendation certificates in duplicate under their stamp and signature giving descriptions of the goods, their value and names of ports into which they are to be imported and the countries of export. Banks are being authorised by the Reserve Bank of India to open letters of credit and to make remittances of foreign exchange against recommendation certificates issued by the political Agents without the approval of the Government of India. The Poli tical Agents should take the following facts into considera tion before recommending applications: (1) the applicant is a bonafide import dealer of that place; (2) the goods to be imported are normally imported from thaxxKXHXxyxx^xKHHxigKKSKix that particular country, or are not available elsewhere; ' (3) the goods to be imported are available for export from the country of consignment; (4) the amount applied for is reasonable and is within the quotas assigned to ports within their jurisdiction; (5) the goods are ROT for re-export to Saudi Arabia or Iran. (cf. your telegram No. a/ 732, May 9th 1946, and sub-para (b) of para 1 of Secretary of State’s telegram No.16002, September 1st, 1946). 4. With effect from the 1st January, 1947, Political Agents should compile lists of foreign exchange applications recommended by them in the form of a statement giving the following particulars:- 1. Date of approval. 2. Name of bank through whom application has been 3. Full name &amp; address of the importer. received. 4. The nature of goods imported. 5. Country of origin of the goods- 6. Country .from where the goods will be consigned. 7. Quantity. 8. Approximate value. 9. Remarks. - Copies of these statements’ should be forwarded by Political Agents to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, the Government of India and the Reserve Bank of India every month. 5. The Reserve Bank of India will compare the actual forms received from the banks reporting remittances of foreign exchange with the monthly statements received from the various political Agents. This method will do away with the present •cumbersome procedure by which political Agents have to re.L.er all applications to the Government of India, because, quotas having once been fixed, they can recommend exchange applica tions immediately. importers will also be able to obtain their foreign exchange promptly, and it will enable the Govern ment of India to transfer quotas from one port to another, it experience shows that original quotas allotted were too large or too small. 6. A copy of the draft instructions being issued by the Reserve* Bank of India to banks in Dubai, Bahrain, Kuwait, Bombay and Karachi is enclosed herewith. ph© issue.......has been authorised. Sd./- S.J.L. OLVER India. Under Secy, to the Govt, of/ - t . . i X ■The Manager, The Manager, Imperial Bank of Iran, Eastern Bank, Ltd., Bahrain/Kuwait. Bahrain. (Thro’ the Eastern Bank Ltd., Bombay). Dear Sir, in supersession of our instructions covering the sales of foreign exchange against imports into Muscat, Kuwait, Bahrain/ Dubai, Pasni, Gwadur and Jiwani, the following fresh instructions are being issued to enable banks to accord greater facilities to merchants to import goods from countries outside the sterling area. 2. Imports from the Sterling Area . There are no restrictions on the import o$' goods of sterling area origin into any of the Persian Gulf ports and remittances in sterling or in rupees may be made to che sterling area country concerned or any other sterling area country freely provided payment in to a resident account, without uny recom mendation of the Political Agents or the permission of the Reserve Bank of India. Details of sales of sterling or rupees for this purpose need not be reported to the Reserve Bank of India. 3• Imports from Belgium, Belgian Congo . China Czechoslovakia Denmark France and French Empire Greece Italy Netherlands Netherlands East Indies Poland Spain, and Yugoslavia. Although these countries are outside the sterling urea, exchange control regulations have been relaxed to permit banks to make remittances or open letters of credit covering imports from any of these countries into the Persian Gull ports men tioned in para 1 without either the recommendation of the political Agent or the approval of the Reserve Bank of India. The conditions under which sales or transfers in sterling may be made are those laid down in section IX of ohe exchange oon- trol Manual. All sales of foreign currency and transfers to sterling, must be made on Forms A and 3.A.1 and reported to tne Reserve Bank on form B.l. 4 . Imports from countries outside the sterling area other t nan those menti o ned in _pa rJ3. No letters of credit may be opened or sales oi foreign exchange or transfer^ of sterling or rupees to non-residents be made against imports from countries outside the sterling area, other than those mentioned in para 3, except on the . recommendation of the political Agent, importers should be directed to apply to the political Agent for ( the necessary recommendation either direct or through a bank. In the case of applications through banks the latter should satisfy them /selves...3 -Pi- selves that the applications are bona fide and thereafter forward the applications together with the documentary evidence in support of the proposed imports such as the correspondence or cables exchanged between the importer and the shippers or their agents to the Political Agents concerned. After the Political Agent has issued a recom mendation certificate, a letter of credit may be opened on the usual terms or a remittance made. If direct remittances are made against imports which are not covered by letters of credit, banks must satisfy themselves that the relative goods have been landed in the Persian Gulf port specified in the certificate. The original recommendation certificate of the Political Agent must be forwarded to the Reserve Bank of India attached to the A or S.A.l form along with the D.l return. Duplicate copies of the form approved by the Poli tical Agent shouldjbe retained by the bank for their record. 6. Banks should carefully note that in the absence of a recommendation certificate of the political Agent no remittances should be made against goods imported from countries mentioned in paragraph 4, even though finance for such imports may be arranged by importers in Persian Gulf ports through their London agents or intermediaries in sterling in the united Kingdom or from any other sterling area country. A statement of actual letters of credit opened or remittances made against bills not drawn under letters of credit opened against imports from countries mentioned in paragraphs should be submitted to the Reserve Bank of India every month on the following lines; 1. Date of remittance or letter of credit opened. 2. Full name and address of the importer. 3. Country of origin of the goods. 4. Country from where the goods have been consigned. 5.

The 8th of November, 1947 To / / The Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bahrain. / Subject: UNCONTROLLED TRANSACTIONS IN U.3. DOLLARS MEMORANDUM .s Reference Residency telegram No. A/627, dated the 14th August, 1947. 2. Hitherto such control of sales and purchases of U.S. dollars as exists has been exercised in Bahrain by the Banks acting on executive instructions issued by the Reserve Bank of India. 3. This control, however, does not extend to sales and purchases of dollars by private traders or firms who have their own contacts in the United States or who can operate in the dollar market without recourse to the services offered by the Banks here. There is, therefore, an uncontrolled market in dollars in Bahrain. 4. The Bahrain petroleum Company appear to be able to import goods from the United States without consulting the exchange controller here. It is possible that these trans actions are done through their London office and that they are controlled in London; but it is more probable, I think, that the dollars are provided by their principals in the United States without consulting the Bank of England. 5. A more serious free market in dollars - for it is conducted without regard for the controlled exchange rates - is the sale for rupees to Bahrain merchants of U.S. currency notes and dollar cheques drawn on U.S. Banks by employees of the Arabian American Oil Company. These currency notes and cheques are remitted so the united States through the post for the credit of the purchasers' accounts in the united States. They use the dollars to import goods from idle United States for sale in Bahrain and for re-export. Another potential seller of dollars in this market is Mr. Henry C. Wynant, an American citizen, who has come here to buy pearls and wishes to purchase rupees for this purpose with his dollar funds. 6. The only earners of dollars in Bahrain who at present credit them to the Empire Dollar Pool by selling them to the Banks here are Messrs. Gray Mackenzie’s. They earn dollars by their shipping services to the Arabian American Oil Company in Saudi Arabia. 7. An allotment amounting to $.241,650/- was made this year from the Empire Dollar Pool for the purchase' by local merchants of essential commodities for use in Bahrain, but not for re-export. Although this allotment may not have been an unduly generous one at the time it was made, it was, in the present circumstances, a very generous one indeed; and, in equity, since their traders received aid from the Empire Dollar pool, it is reasonable to expect Che Bahrain Government to co-operate in making available to the Pool all dollars /earnedearned here. 8. It remains to examine how this can best be done. 8* ^ The Bahrain Petroleum Company have expressed in their political Agreement their desire .o submit to the influence of His Majesty's Government in Bahrain; and I bave no doubt that, if the position were explained to them, they would agree - if it were considered desirable^ that they should agree to submit their dollar trans actions to control In London; but it is possible that their dollar expenditure does not in any way constitute a drain on the Empire Dollar pool (even by loss of contri butions to it) because their products - except the recent shipments to the United States for the United States Navy - are sold in the Sterling Area, while dollars for the pur chase ^of their essential equipment, which might give them a claim on the Empire Dollar pool, appear to be provided by their principals in the U.S.A. 10. The Bahrain merchants' transactions in dollars sold by employees of the Arabian American Oil Company are not so easy to control. Were we to impose, with the consent of the Bahrain Government, a ban on these transactions it is uoubciul how far it could be made effective unless imports j. ron tne uni ted States were controlled also. Bahrain merchants could buy their dollars in Saudi Arabia. Control of imports would be the most effective way of making uncontrolled pur chases of dollars less profitable; but, if this control were exercised rigidly, it might well drive the re-export trade from Bahrain over to B&amp;udi Arabia. This is not'in the immediate interests of the people of Bahrain or of the Bahrain Government, who have just expended a considerable sum of money (with the encouragement of a former political Agent -vide correspondence resting with Colonel Galloway's demi-oii icial letter No. C/bGd, ciated the 30th May, 1946) to provide warehouses to cater for this trade. 11. Mr. Wynant's case is slightly different, qe has come here co purchase pearls because he cannot - owing to the Government of India's ban on their import into India - at present purchase them in Bombay, where he is ordinarily established. He expects to sell between #100,000 and #200,000. He is naturally interested in selling his dollars (or buying his rupees) in the open market rather than through the^ banks, because the present uncontrolled rate is Ps,4/8 to 4/10 to the dollar, against Ps.3/3/4 that the Banks can pay. Buying rupees in the open market would enable him to buy iiis pearls some 40# more cheaply than if he bought his rupees tnrough the Bank, and might well make the difference between his being able to buy pearls here at a price at which he can sell at a profit and his not buying here at all. The Bahrain Government are likely to consider it to be in, at any rate, their short-term interest that he should buy pearls here, the^more so because they advanced some Rs.161,000 to the pearling nakhudas this summer to sustain the industrv. If we insist on Mr. Wynant's selling his dollars through the Bank, it is possible that he may be driven to return to India. He has, I understand, already put it to the Reserve Bank that the ban on the import of pearls into India should be lifted, and has offered to sell to the Reserve Bank his dollars at the controlled rate if the Government of India will permit the import into Bombay of pearls from the Persian Gulf. He would /preferV -3- prefer, if he could, to buy his pearls in India because there he can buy the type he requires, while here sellers are anxious that he should buy the good with the bad and he is faced with having the bad pearls left on his hands. The only market for low quality pearls at present is in India. Were we to drive Mr. Wynant back to India, it might be construed as an act contrary to the interests of the Bahrain pearling industry, although, if India were to be reopened to their pearls, it would be more in the pearl brokers’ interestthan their having to sell only a portion of them here, or none at all. His Majesty's Government's interests on the other hand would not be adversely affected by Mr. Wynant f s return to India, because dollars sold in India would be credited, for the present at any race, to the Empire Dollar Pool; and it is obviously more in His Majesty's Government's interest that the dollars should be sold in India and credited to the Pool than that they should be sold here and lost to it. 12. There would appear, therefore, to be two courses open co us. Either we can require by legislation all dollars sold in Bahrain to be sold through the Banks; impose a ban on the remittance, except by the Banks, of notes and cheques through the post co the United Gtates; and make uncontrolled purchases of dollars less profitable, or even profitless, by imposing control of imports from the United States - both for local consumption and for re export. Alternatively, we could condone uncontrolled sales here and purchases by Bahrain merchants here or in Saudi Arabia; estimate the amount of dollars bought (by asking the Bahrain Government to require importers and re-exporters to show their invoices in respect of goods paid for with dollars); and deduct the amount of dollars expended on goods for consumption in Bahrain from Bahrain's quota for 1948 of controlled dollars and other hard currencies purchasable with dollars - assuming, of course, that Bahrain is to have another quota. 13. Merchants would then be free to buy dollars from S&amp;udi Arabia for goods for re-export - thus safeguarding Bahrain's re-export trade -; and it would be up to the Bahrain Govern ment to ensure - if they thought fit, by import or other controls - that the best use was made of some of these dollars to purchase essential goods for sale in Bahrain. They would soon discover that every dollar bought on the open market at a 40^ premium was being set off against a controlled dollar or against their quota of other hard currencies; and they would have to decide whether their re-export trade was worth the extra cost of supplies for internal consumption. 14. The first course open to us would require the co operation of the Bahrain Government and, because it might result in driving Bahrain's re-export trade to Saudi Arabia and Mr. Wynant back to India, involves a political issue. The second course has the advantage of not restricting Bahrain's re-export trade; of being simple to administer; and possibly of utilizing for Bahrain's internal requirements - and thus relieving the Empire Dollar Pool of an obligation - dollars emanating from Saudi Arabia that would otherwise be lost to the Pool. Against this is the consideration that Gray Mackenzies' and Mr* Wynant's sales of dollars that we p-re-s-ent insist on being sold to the Banks here would be freed from control, and these sales are likely to exceed - Ad U-Ml during the next 12 months - the amount of dollars (and other hard currencies purchasable with dollars) that Bahrain can expect to receive from the Pool for 1948. Also, it might /leadlead to a rise in prices in Bahrain; but I do not think the rise would be serious. condoning purchases by Bahrain aerehancs in Saudi Arabia (where they would go if such purchases were banned here) of dollars at uncontrolled prices for use for imports to Bahrain and for their re-export business and, at the same time, of controlling sales here by Gray Mackenzie's and Mr. Wynant. It would, obviously be inequitable to these two sellers £o control their sales here because they are subject to our jurisdiction and to condone purchases in Saudi Arabia by Bahrain merchants whose import and re export business could be controlled by the Bahrain Govern ment. We should not have one rule for foreigners and another for Bahrain subjects - especially as Bahrain subjects have had the advantage of an allotment from the Empire Dollar Pool. 16. My view is, therefore, tnat the Bahrain Government enjoy very considerable advantages Ixx from the inclusion of Bahrain in the Sterling Area and from the supplies of food and other commodities that His Majesty’s Government make available to them ac controlled prices. In return, the Ruler should, I feel, accept a measure of control and co operate in enforcing it. The position is possibly similar in Kuwait; and the Shaikh of Bahrain's co-operation will be difficult to obtain - or^indeed,to retain - unless the Shaikh of Kuwait follows suit. 17. I suggest that this should be explained to the Shaikh of Bahrain, and that he should be invited to co-operate with us in pursuing the first course outlined in puragraphJL^T 18. I should be grateful for early instructions on the line of action that should be followed; and particularly for instructions regarding the reply that I should give to Mr. Wynant. He has asked to be allowed to sell dollars in the open market here to buy rupees to pay for the pearls for which he is at present negotiating. Mr. Wynant has stated that, if there is a legal control to which he is subject, he has no desire to evade it; but that he naturally does not wish to buy rupees at a disadvantage if there is no legal control. 19. At present there does not appear zo be any legal enactment that requires him or anyone else to sell or purchase dollars only through the Banks here, or at con trolled rates, if the transactions are done without the Bank’s assistance. 15. I do not favour a third alternative: that of ht Political Agent, Bahrain. NSCONFIDENTIAL No. C/1034 POLITICAL AGENCY BAHRAIN. The 9th of November, 1947 To The Hon’ble the political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bahrain . Subject ; UT-IC ON TROLLS D TRANSACTIONS IN U.S. DOLLARS. ^ , MEMORANDUM. ^ No. 3534-36/89, dated the 8th November, 1947, that Gray Mackenzies' net earnings of dollars here amounted to /204,242 in the six months from the 1st May, 1947, and the 31st October. In addition, from the 1st November, 1947, they expect to earn $3600 a month at their recently opened branch at Misha'ab. This information was not available in detail when memorandum No. 3534-36/89 was written,. 2. in view of this I am strongly in favour of action on the lines suggested in paragraph 17 of the Agency memorandum referred to; and, on further examination, I do not think it would be unduly difficult to enforce effectively. Most purchases of dollar cheques by Bahrain merchants are at present made in Bahrain from Americans visiting Bahrain for the weekend. The majority of these Americans are not known personally to the merchants in Bahrain, and it is usual for them to be introduced by an American resident here who knows them, in spite of this the merchants have already bought a number of cheques that have been dishonoured. Were Bahrain merchants forced by legislation here to go to Saudi Arabia to buy their dollar cheques, this risk would be increased; and, with effective control of imports and re-exports, the transactions would become increasingly less profitable. It might also be advisable to introduce examination of certain mails addressed to U.S. business and banking firms by Bahrain merchants, as has, I understand, been done recently in the United Kingdom in connection with exchange controls. 3. Nor do l overrate the chances of much of Bahrain’s present re-export business - of** potential new business - going over to Saudi Arabia. Conditions are very unstable there; the prizes at present are not very large; and a temporary phase of exchange control here is unlikely to persuade the merchant community to uproot themselves.

Furthermore, he knows perfectly well that merchants (though admittedly before the recent 'dollar crisis') have had allotments of dollars from us for cars, refrigerators, etc., and it is too much to expect that he will accept our refusal to grant them to the Ruler for machinery which could probably not be obtained from England within any reasonable time and which, incidentally, is required for capital development. 2.

Jehn Birch and Cempany, Meergat® Street, Leaden, are establishing a branch in Bahrain where they prep^se to locate a full staff of engineers and nrovide workshop facilities including an engineering stores depot to cater for the whole of the Persian Gulf. Mr. Pennycuick representing the v firri called on me recently and said that to enable his firm to function ijfficiently it would be essential t*&gt; import consider able quantities of machinery and spare parts from America. He stated that his he*d office would apply to the proper authorities in the U.K. for exchange for this purpose. He made however a suggestion of considerable interest for obtaining dollars for the use of his firm. He informed me that Aramco have to buy large quantities of rupees for paying their staff on the mainland and he proposed that his firm should be permitted to sell rupees Aramc® in order to obtain dollars to cover their imports from America. He told me that Aramco have recently purchased rupees 30 lakhs with dollars in Bahrain presumably from local merchants. Possibly as a result of this the black market rate ©f the dollar in Bahrain has recently fallen to Bs.3/10. 2 . I see no objection to Pennycuick's proposal at first sight but if his office decide t^ take it up with His Majesty's Government and H.M.G. are inclined to approve it I should be grateful if I could be consulted before a final decision is reached. Alternatively it is for consideration whether H.M.G. could not contrive to reap some benefit for themselves by the supply of rupees to Aramco in exchange for dollars. I under stand that Aram co pay their Indian employees in rupees and their local labour in Saudi Arabian rials but that they derive some benefit by purchasing rials with rupees. Yours sincerely, 3gd.

They are anxious for us to consider the possibilities of restricting the foreign exchange transactions of British and United States^ controlled firms to the local banks, and have asked us to examine the problem further with the following points in mind:- (a) Which Oil Companies are involved: (b) how much approximately in United States dollars is un loaded by each of them annually and in what particular ports; (c) within what range of rates approximately dea does the free market rate for United States dollars fluctuate; (d) in what form are the dollars sold (notes or dollar drafts (e) in what form are the rupees purchased (and if in the form of rupee drafts, on what Banks are they drawn); (f) if only notes are involved, whether there is any possib ility of controlling imports of the United ’States dollars or exports of the rupees; (g) whether, if.control could be introduced the Oil Companies would have alternative means of obtaining rupees so that the introduction of control would merely drive them away from the Gulf 2. Will you please answer these questions to the best of your,ability. 3. To Bahrain only . - So far as I am aware ARAMCO are no longer purchasing rupees in the open market in Bahrain and the foreign exchange transactions of British and United States cont rolled firms are confided to the local banks. The - dollars- available in Bahrain are therefore derived either from imports of this currency from the mainland, or from purchases by United States nationals in the Bahrain ba'zaar. Would you please confirm this and give, if possible, a rough estimate of the amount of dollars which become available in Bahrain monthly from each of these .two sources. Incidentally I have recently been informed that Kuwait merchants are' buying, up all the dollars in the Bahrain black m a rket for the purchase of Mexican gold pieces which they are importing by air from Syria and that the dollar rate has in consequence risen to ns.4/12.&gt; .Do you think it would be possible to persuade the Bahrain Government to forbid the export of dollars ? It would of course be better if they could be- persuad ed to issue an order restricting dollar transactions to the banks but this is perhaps too much to hope for. 4. To Kuwait only . Reports were received at the end of last year that ARAMCO were purchasing rupees in the Bahrain bazar v I do not think anything of this sort has occurred in Kuwait and it is probable that British and United States controlled/’firms are already confining their foreign exchange transactions to the local banks. Can you confirm this ? I should be grateful if you will let me have an estimate of the rough monthly intake of black market dollars in Kuwait and the sources from which they are derived. C.J.

The various quantities of dollars that flood thpe &gt; market of Bahrain, it is understood, are those sold by the . individual employees of Bapco. But these are in small v i amounts. Larger quantities however find their way into Bahrain Island from Dhahran where they are available in abundance. The sellers of these dollars in Dhahran are si^£d to be individual American emnloy^ees of Aramco as well *- as other American companies whose braches are doing A contracting works for Aramco.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0001ec_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/2/381</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0001ec</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/2/381</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 9/37 Foreign exchange'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1947/1948</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2015-06-04T00:12:33</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (125 folios)</extent><extent>The papers in the file are arranged chronologically.
