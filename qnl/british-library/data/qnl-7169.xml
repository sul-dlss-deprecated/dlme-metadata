It contains 49 named and unnamed individuals (in Arabic and English) of the Āl Rashīd family of Abu Dhabi, some with birth and death dates, as well as brief biographical information.The table was compiled by John Calcott Gaskin in 1905 based on a table by Colonel Edward Charless Ross, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, that appears in the
                           Persian Gulf Administration Reportfor the years 1888-1889. The table was revised in 1906 by Captain Stuart George Knox, Political Agent at Kuwait.There is also a 'Chronological list of the Amīrs of Jabal Shammar belonging to this family' with the periods of their reign, including: ’Abdullah-bin-’Ali [‘Abdullāh bin ‘Alī], Talāl-bin-’Abdullah [Ṭalāl bin ‘Abdullāh], Mat’ab-bin-’Abdullah [Mut‘ib bin ‘Abdullāh], Bandar-bin-Talāl [Bandar bin Ṭalāl], ’Abdul Azīz-bin-Mat’ab [‘Abd al-‘Azīz bin Mut‘ib], and Sultān-bin-Hamūd [Sulṭān bin Ḥamūd]. There is also a note about the tribal origins of the family.In addition, a section of 'Notes' is included that gives 1907 as the year of compilation (presumably by John Gordon Lorimer), as well as other details concerning the arrangement of the table, including: the omission of nearly all females; 'issue' means 'male issue'; the ordering of sons from the same father according to seniority from left to right, but all daughters are placed in the position of juniority on the extreme right; dates of birth are only approximate; and when the fact or date of death is not mentioned the person was probably alive in 1906.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023876399.0x000003#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
