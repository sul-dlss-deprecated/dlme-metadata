The reservation stated that adherence to the treaty should not be construed as denying any right of sovereignty of the Government of Persia to the Persian Gulf and its waters. The reservation had serious diplomatic implications for the British Government in view of Persia's claim to Bahrain. The file contains correspondence between the Foreign Office and the British Embassy, Washington, recording British objections to the reservation, the response of the US Government, and the reasons for the attaching of the reservation. The Geneva Arms Traffic Convention was eventually ratified by the United States Senate (without the reservation) in March 1935.The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Embassy</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>United States Senate</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>Geneva Arms Traffic Convention (1925)</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Persian Gulf</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Territorial waters</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000183#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000183#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
