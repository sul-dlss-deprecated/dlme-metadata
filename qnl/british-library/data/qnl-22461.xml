As regards the Court Sword, a certificate from you countersigned by the Political Agent, is required that the sword is necessary in the perfor mance of your duties as a Political Officer.

Dear Sir, With reference to the attached Transportation Order the duplicate of which was returned to your Truck driver, a signature was given by my wife on the 9th February, 1947 for ' two tons of coke' but the number of sacks actually delivered was 41 only. The usual nuiaber of sacks per ton is, I believe, 24, and so presumably, the total for two tons should have been 48. If this presumption is correct I should be grateful if you would kindly ensure that I am only charged for^ctual amount of coke delivered i.e. 41 sacks. Tours faithfully. i/. (M.D.H.

Dear Colonel Hay, please refer to Jackson's demi-official letter No.1310-65/19, dated the 4th June, 1947, and to our various conversations on the subject of Ranee's and my own leave. 2. For the reasons already given in the enclosure to my letter ro. 1609-1/4, dated the llch ?'ay, 1947, Ranee does not wish to postpone his leave, and has booked his passage leaving here on June 15, and a return passage to bring him here on the 20th of July. T have told him that, as you said, he may have to postpone his leave if I am required immediately for interviews. « 3. T am naturally apprehensive that postponement of my interviews — even though at my own verbal request in order to fit in interviews and leave together — may prejudice my chances of future employment in government service or otherwise; and I should, therefore, be grateful if, as soon as you are able to do so, you can give me an assurance tha.t such chances will not be prejudiced. 4. As I stated this morning, it is a matter of extreme disappointment to me that ray request for three months' leave mentioned first to you about a year ago should not have been given priority over applications from those who have been at home later than I have. I gathered from what you said that the result of this is that it seems unlikely that I shall be able to have more than six weeks' leave. Yours Sincerely, l Sd./- C.J. PELLY The Hon'ble Lt-Col. '.V.R.

Those residing in the United Kingdom will submit their applications to the Accountant-General 5 India Office, who will transmit them urgently by air mail (with full particulars of the recoveries on account of subscriptions, et'c., made by him and the Monthly Account Current through which credit for the sam- will be afforded to India), to the Accounts Officer. (b) In the case of subscribers to the Sterling Branch where a subscriber desires to receive payment in Sterling of the amount standing at credit in his Sterling account, the application will be accompanied for Secretary to H : Excellency the Crown Representative.

Any debits in the accounts subsequent to that date should also be taken in account. The balance will be paid to the subscriber as soon as all particulars as to subsequent subscriptions have been received by the Controller from Accounts Officers concerned and requirements of the rules have been satisfied. Officers transferred to the special un-employed list and those officers in categories (I) to (III) of the semi-effective list who do not expect to return to the Active List will be permitted to exercise the option of withdrawing the amounts standing to their credit in the Fund. If recalled to duty officers who have exercised this option, and officers of the Indian Regular Reserve of officers, will be permitted to rejoin the fund in^the \ same manner and under the same conditions as original subscribers; officers of the Indian Medical Service recalled under the Royal Warrent for the Indian Medical Service dated the 12th Anril 1937, will be similarly treated. 1 , Rule 9(vii) s- A subscriber who has been granted leave ^ preparatory to retirement or who xvhilo on leal?e is either permitted to retire or is declared by a medical board to be unfit for further service, may withdraw the amount standing at his credit in the Fund at any time between the commencement of the leave, or the date of such permission, or of such declaration, as the case-may be, and the ^datc of actual retirement subject, however, to the condition that he may be required, should he return to duty at the end of his leave, to repay to the fund the whole arrunt; withdrawn by him with interest thereon.

I froa ay BaaJt atateaent for July 1947 that I have bt?«n d«blt«d with the aua of i ; .s«iO/- on account of Bahrain Gyakhana Club subscription. It has not in th» past been the custom in Bahrain for a club subscription to be levied froa the Political Agcsnt. I should be grateful therefore if you would arrange for it to be refunded to ay credit in due course. Yours Sincerely, M«A. Findlayf Ksquir^t The Accountant, Eastern B^nk Ltd. f Bahrain*From A. Pindlay, Hon. Treasurer, Bahrain Gymkhana club. xHIL EASrERN BANK, LII T TED, BAHRAIN. The 11th August, 1947. Dear Major Ranee, With reference to your letter 'of 7th August, I am not aware of any concession in subscription being afforded by che Club to political AgeAts. I have gone through the Subscription Register for the past ten years, and I find that all the political Agents before Colonel Galloway's benure of office were subscription-paying members of the Club while Colonel Galloway never joined the Club. T propose, however, to place your letter before the committee at/their next meeting and tfill convey their ruling to you in due course since I cannot myself undertake the creation of a precedent. Yours sincerely, 3d./- A. /INDLAY1 no. Ths 1.2th August, L947. ^ear Finiiay, please refer to your letter of ihe 11th August, L947. There is no question of my asking for a concession, and, personally, T do not In the least grudge a subscription of Rs.lO/- a month. The point is, however, that, according to my information, a precedent Is being broken and not created by charging the political Agent subscription. 2. When nr. pelly tooK over here as political A ^ent over two years ago, he became ex-officio an honorary member of the Bahrain Gymkhana, and the same thing later happened to Colonel Galloway, and, if my memory serves me right, to myself when I took over as political Agent last hot weather. Colonel Galloway certainly used the old swimming bath regularly as did Mr. Pelly and the latter also used the Golf Course, and, during his second tenure as political Agent here this year, attended at least one Club meeting-at Mr. Belgrave's. As far as I am aware, he was never charged a subscription. The point at issue is, therefore, whether or not the Political Agent should continue to be ex-officio an honorary member of the Gymkhana Club as has been the case for at least the last two years, and it is not, in any *ay, a personal matter concerning myself. Yours sincerely. &lt;]. K.A. Pindlay, ^sq., Accountant, The Eastern 3ank, Ltd., Bahrain. N3.No. 1 (VI To t.'a s POLITICAL AGENCY, BAHRAIN.

Please refer to your letter of the 4th October 1949 regarding the refund of medical charges. I have gone in to the matter with Dr.Snow, whom you know, and Grant the Quarantine Medical Officer and it appears that according to the Accountant General Central Revenues rulings and Snow 1 ^records of your medical expenses, you would be entitled to something between Rs.40/- and Rs.60/-. Snow says that your treatment by his department was on the understanding that it was by your own choice and at your own expense. 2. In the circumstances, we feel that it is hardly worth while for you to pursue the matter further and this is also the view of both the Medical Officers. It might involve endless correspondence with the Accountant General Central Revenues with no satisfactory result at the end of it. I am sorry not to be able to be of more help to you, but these adjustments with either India or Pakistan since partition are real headacheJ A Yours sincerely.
