Although if stocks of spares were hold at Bahrein instead of Iran, it might he easier to transfer them to other areas in the Persian Gulf; There would he no advantage to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company by keeping them at Bahrein instead of on the spot. In any case, the Company do not consider that the suggestion is a practicable one, particularly in view of the very large requirem- nto of Iran as against Bahrein* I agree entirely with the views of the Company* Mr* ; rascr is, of course, also on the Boards of the Iraq Pctro- leiam Company, Petroleum concessions Limited, and the Kuweit Oil Company and the Basrah Petroleum Company, and in view of tills opinion I hove not sounded the Bahrein Petroleum Company especially as the local managers of the Bahrein Petroleum Company did not favour the scheme* It seems, therefore, that the proposal need not he pursued hut I think it would he useful if the Political Agent could ascertain the quantities of spares which the Bahrein Company carry* A copy of this letter lias been sent to Jerratt* Yours sincerely, R.

M.0997/39• !i JCR. .T Dear Peel, Your letter P.2.789/39 of the 8th February about the maintenance of spares by Oil Companies operating in the Gulf* It goes almost without eayin/; that we regard it as of great importance that the output of oil from the Persian Gull should not be interrupted in war time* We are not, of course f in a position to gauge the degree of interruption which would be caused by destruction of any particular part of either drilling or refining machinery* The Companies must, however, reckon with the virtual certainty that, for a variety of reasons, the transport of spare parts to the Gulf, whether from this country or America, would take considerably longer in war time than in peace time* The risk of delay is all the greater because it is probable that in certain contingencies shipping from the United ingdom to the Gulf would have to proceed by the Cape Route* While a certain amount of spare gear for oil plant could, presumably, be shipped in tankers returning to the Gulf in ballast, there might be other demands on this sped d freighting capacity* In these circumstances, and on the g neral ground that any arrangement which would reduce the demand on merchant shipping in war time is, ipso facto, valuable, we consider it highly desirable that the Companies operating in the Gulf should make ample pr vision against &amp; mag or breakdown in their installations* S* m have now seen Starling^ letter of the 24th February and fully appreciate that th re is nothing \ H • eel y ^ # • 0 • , India office, S.vv.l. ' —3 &gt; ^ 2. to be done about the ;nglo-Iranlan Company^ oilfields and refineries in Iran? indeed, it see s that they have taken all the precautions which could reasonably be expected* Vie are not quite so clear, however, that the position of the nglo-Iranian Co* necessarily precludes an approach t &gt; the other oil firms Interested in this part of the world, or at least to the Bahrein Petroleum Company and Petroleum Concessions Ltd* § It is true that fteightman’s idea contemplated a common pool of spares, but the essential object seems to us to be that each Company should make the necessary provision in whatsoever manner it considers best * on the f» ce of it, we cannot see any reason why, if the other companies do not wish to hold stocks in common, the Bahrein Petroleum company and Petroleum* Concessions Ltd* should not each have a separate stock either at Bahrein or elsewhere* We associate our: elves, therefore, with Starling’s suggestion that enquiries should be made as to the quantities of spares held by the former Company on the spot. If, as may well prove to be the case, these stocks ore adequate in the light of the shipment delays likely to be experienced in war time, the position would appear to be reasonably satisfactory for the present, since Petroleum Concessions Ltd* have hardly got going* If, however, enquiry shows that the Bahrein Petrolevxn Company have not made sufficient provision, we feel that further consideration should be given to the question of urging them to remedy the deficiency, in their own interests as well as ours* I am sending copies of this letter to Starling and Baggallay* Yours sincerely.

No doubt, however, stocks of various stores, etc., are based on their rate of consumption and it may be difficult to set a period to cover the variety of parts which they carry. I am afraid that it is impossible for us to assess the stock in terms of months’ consumption, but it would seem from the estimated value given that considerable stocks are carried. It would be useful if they could give information on the following lines:- (i) What stocks of equipment, spare parts, essential materials, etc., are normally carried for drilling, etc. 7 (expressed in terms of months’ supply). (ii) Normal sources of supply of equipment, etc. in (i). (iii) Whether difficulties are anticipated in obtaining supplies generally or any specialized parts from (iv ) Whether the question of increasing present stocks has been considered and the result. It is noted that the Company are considering the possibility of improving and accelerating the delivery of certain supplies from India. In this It would, of course, have been better if the any particular source during an emergency J.P. Gibson, Esq., India Office, King Charles Street S.W.l. conn:oti on/2 . connection.; it will 'he remembered that the Air Ministry are relying on the Burma oilfields to produce large quantities of aviation spirit in an emergency, and in order to maintain the maximum output, large supplies - considerably in excess of normal requirements - of imported stores for oilfields and refineries will be essential. Arrangements are being made this end for the Board of Trade to give priority for these stores and to arrange shipment. In view of this it seems very doubtful whether the Bahrein Company can expect to obtain additional supplies from India in time of war and it should, I think, be suggested to the Company that in the circumstances their stocks of spares should be increased and that they should arrange for an alternative source of supply. I am sending a copy of this letter to V/ all worth and Baggallay.
