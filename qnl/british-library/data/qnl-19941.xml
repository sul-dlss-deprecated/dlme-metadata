February 18, 1929. CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1. [E 853/33/91] No. 1. Sir Austen Chamberlain to Hovhannes Khan Mossaed. Sir, Foreign Office, February 18, 1929. IN a note dated the 18th January, 1928, I had the honour to inform you, in reply to your note of the 26th November, 1927, respecting the claim advanced by your Government to the islands of Bahrein, that His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom were not aware of any valid grounds upon which the claim of the Persian Government to sovereignty over those islands was or could be based. Some months later, on the 2nd August, 1928, the Persian Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs addressed to His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires at Tehran a further note explaining in detail the reasons which have led his Government to consider themselves justified in advancing such a claim. I now have the honour to request that you will convey to^ your Government the following reply:— ^ I ^ 2. His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom have examined with the greatest care the views set forth in the Persian Government's note of the 2nd August, and have endeavoured to extract from the many unsupported declarations that Bahrein forms an integral part of Persia (a statement which, as I have already indicated in my note under reference, bears no relation to geographical facts), the essential arguments on which this claim is based. They note that the Persian Government do not in any way base their claim on the alleged recognition of their rights in the past by His Majesty's Government. So far as can be deduced from their note under reply, their claim is, in fact, founded on three main arguments: Firstly, on uninterrupted possession except for the period of Portuguese occupation between 1507 and 1622; secondly, on an alleged principle of international law that a territory belonging to a sovereign State cannot be lawfully detached so long as its annexation by another State or its independence have not been officially recognised by the lawful owner of the territory; and thirdly, on documents of a date later than the end of the 18th century, in which the sheikhs of the islands are alleged to have declared their submission to the Persian Government, and on the alleged payment by them of tribute to the Persian Government. After full examination of these arguments His Majesty's Government have reached the conclusion, for the reasons given below, that they entirely fail to substantiate a Persian claim to sovereignty over the islands at the present day. 3. In the first place, the statement that ' Bahrein has always and uninterruptedly formed part of Persia in past centuries, except during the Portuguese occupation from 1507 to 1622 ' is not one which can be allowed to pass unquestioned. I have already drawn attention to the evident fact that geographically this assertion is misleading. Historically it is almost equally misleading. The earlier history of the islands before 1507 is obscure, but it cannot seriously be maintained that they were subject to Persian sovereignty all through the Arab, Mongol and Tartar invasions and the anarchy of the Middle Ages. On the contrary, modern historians have expressed the opinion that from the 11th to the beginning of the 16th century the inhabitants of Bahrein were subject to chiefs of their own race; and, among contemporary writers, the Arabian geographer, Idrisi, writing in the latter half of the 12th century, stated categorically that the island was then governed by an independent chief. It is, therefore, impossible to accept the view that the island was continuously subject to Persia before 1507. Between the years 1507 and 1622 the islands were occupied by the Portuguese, as the Persian Government themselves admit. The period of Persian rule began in 1622 and ended in 1783, when the Persian troops' were finally driven out of the islandiTby the ancestors of the present Sheikh of Bahrein, but it is not to be supposed tKal even during This period oT Persian ascendancy, Persian rule was continuous and unchallenged, or that it brought peace and prosperity to the inhabitants. The Persian occupation after the expulsion of the Portuguese was of uncertain duration. [716 s—1] bbut it seems to be established that about the year 1718 a descent was made upon the island by the Omani Arabs, who then occupied it for a short period. In the middle of the 18th century control appears to have passed into the hands of the once powerful Huwala Arabs, who even at the present day are strongly represented there, though in I /53 Persia was again able to assert her ascendancy by conquest. Tn 1783, however, the troops of His Majesty the Shah were finally driven out by the Utubi Arabs, and the authority of Persia ceased, never to be re-established. 4 It will be evident from the brief historical summary contained in the preceding paragraph that such historical evidence as can be adduced in favour of the Persian^claim must rest mainly upon intermittent occupation between the years 1622 and 1783, a period which comprises at least two periods of Arab rule. On the other hand, a period of approximately equal length between 1783 and the present day has elapsed during which no dominion has been exercised in the islands by Persia/and Arab rule has been uninterrupted. Tn these circumstances His Majesty's Government cannot but regard the claim of Bahrein to independence from Persia as abundantly established. 5. It is in the light of the historical events summarised above that the second argument of the Persian Government must be examined, viz., that part of their note now under reply in which they affirm as an alleged principle of international law the statement that a territory belonging to a sovereign State cannot be lawfully detached so long as the right of ownership has not been transferred by this State to another State in virtue of an official act, in this case a treaty, or so long as ils annexation by another State or its independence have not been officially recognised by the lawful owner of the territory.' Even if this statement could be accepted as valid, it would still be necessary for Persia to prove that she is, or ever has been, the lawful owner of Bahrein, and that such rights as she may have acquired m former ages by conquest and the exercise of force outweigh those not only of the Portuguese, but of the Arab inhabitants themselves. 6. Ilis Majesty's Government, however, deny without hesitation that any such principle, if alleged to be of universal application, forms part of international law. The assertion that the consent of the dispossessed State is invariably required to validate a change of sovereignty is contradicted both by international' practice and the facts of history. Moreover, it would, if it existed, seriously prejudice the maintenance of peace and international order. It would be open to'any State to advance a claim to territory, of which it has not for centuries been in effective possession, on the ground that its loss of possession in distant ages had not been confirmed by a subsequent treaty. To assert such a legal principle would be to assert that on a disputed question of territory the one factor that is decisive is the expressed will of one of the disputants. On the contrary, in cases where a territory has effectively established its independence of the former sovereign, a treaty by which the disposed owner recognises its independence is in effect chiefly valuable as conclusive evidence that, in the view of the former sovereign, such independence has been effectively established. In such cases the effective establishment by the territory of its independence is the deciding factor in the question of international title, anil in the case of Bahrein His Majesty's Government regard as wholly untenable the proposition that effective possession and administration by the present ruling family for 145 years, during which these rulers have been independent of Persia, and during which no Persian authority has been exercised in their dominions, can be affected by the mere consideration that the Persian Government have not set their signature to a document formally recognising the fact of their independence. 7. It is, moreover, abundantly clear from historical precedents that the theory of the necessity for the formal consent of the dispossessed State is not one which has ever obtained international acceptance. The revolted Spanish colonies in South America were diplomatically recognised as independent States by the United States Government in 1822 and by .the British Government in 1824, many years before their independence was formally admitted by Spain. The independence of Texas in 1837 and that of Panama in 1903 were recognised by the United States, and subsequentlv by Great Britain and other European Powers, long before Mexico and Colombia had ceased to look upon those territories as revolted provinces. In these instances, to which others could, if necessary, be added, the effective establishment of independence Avas clearly regarded by the Powers as the ruling factor in the situation, and the consent of the dispossessed State was not held to be a condition sine qua non of a valid transfer or acquisition of territory. In the case of Bahrein whose sheikhs have now been in treaty relations with His Majesty's Governmentfoi more than a century as independent rulers, it was thus not necessary for His Majest} s (lovernment to await the consent of Persia before such recognition could be accorded. ( i^'. ^ 1 . e onl y 0 ther argument advanced by the Persian Government in support ot their claim is the statement that the sheikhs of Bahrein at some time later than the end of the ISth century declared in writing their entire submission and fidelity to the Persian Government, and that they paid tribute to the Persian Government. Although the Persian Government do not give any details in corroboration of this assertion, and although it would probably be difficult at the present day to prove the authenticity of any documents which may be in their possession. His Majesty's (jo\ernment are perlectly prepared to admit the possibility that such documents may exist. I hey do not, however, consider that the existence of such documents ()r even evidence, were this forthcoming, of payments by the Rulers of Bahrein to the Government of the Shah can be regarded as establishing the validity of Persia's claim. 1 hey have always been well aware that the unfortunate rulers of the islands, suii ounded Ivy warlike and more powerful States which menaced their independence, professed on various occasions during the first sixty or severity years of the 19th century an unwilling allegiance to Muscat, to Persia, to Turkey, to the rulers ot the mainland of Arabia, even to Egypt—to any Power, in short, who would agree to oiler them protection and seemed at the time in a strong enough position to do so; and that at diflerent times for short periods they paid tribute to Muscat, Egypt, or the Wahabi Arabs of the mainland. Any argument based on payment of tribute would, therefore, be available in support of a claim to sovereignty over Bahrein bv any of the States to which tribute was, in fact, paid, and, in any'case, it is evident that this timid and vacillating policy pursued on occasion by his predecessors cannot be held to affect the position of the present sheikh, who is firm in his determination to resist the Persian Government's claims, and has empowered His Majesty's Go'\ ernment to refute them on his behalf, in virtue of the treaties which 'ive them the right of defending Bahrein from external aggression. 9 In view of the fact that the Persian Government do not base any part of their claim on the alleged recognition of that claim by His Majesty's Government in the past, it seems unnecessary here to reply in detail to the various arguments by which the Persian Government endeavour to show that their claims have received British recognition in the past. 1 have already, in my note of the 18th January, 1JJH, explained that it has never on any occasion been the intention of His Majesty's Government to admit the validity of Persia's claims, and I must now ask the Persian Government to believe that a further full and careful examination of the con- temporary records confirms that statement in its entirety. Ever since the year 1820 when His Majesty's Government first entered into special treatv relations with the bheikh of Bahrein without any reference to the Government of the Shah they have acted on the assumption that the sheikh is an independent ruler. In 1822, when Captain William Bruce was recalled for having negotiated the terms of an aoree- Inent P rince Governor of Shiraz without their authority, the main reason recorded tor his recall and for the prompt disavowal of this tentative agreement is that it acknowledges the King of Persia's title to Bahrein, of which there is not the least prooi.;' No clearer statement could possibly have been made of the views held by His Majesty s Government at that date, more'than a century ago; they have never since seen any reason to alter their opinion. n 10 - T he Earl of Clarendon's note of the 29th April , 1869, to which the Persian Go\einment devote so large a part of their note now under reply, was certainly never intended to bear the interpretation now placed upon it by the Persian Govern- ™ en 4; 4. s 5;; s . P ()inted ^ in my. note of the 18th January, i928, it admitted that the I ersian Government had advanced a claim to Bahrein, it stated that due con sideration had been given to their claim, but it did not admit that their claim was m i • i eVen affir ? ls ,. the intention of the British Government to continue to hold the sheikhs to the treaty engagements which had been entered into with them as independent rulers. His Majesty's Government are entirely unable to admit that an implicit acknowledgment of the validity of the Persian claims is constituted by the reference in that note to the considerations which led to the establishment and the maintenance of those treaty relations; nor can they agree that the dependence or otherwise of Bahrein on Persia can in any way be'affected by the fact that in entering upon and maintaining their treaties with the sheikhs they were principally moved by a desire to suppress piracy and the slave trade and to maintain the police [716 s—1] B 2of the Gulf, duties which the Persian Government themselves were not m a position effectively to perform, ft is true that at that time Her Majesty s Goyernment weie mainly influenced by the consideration that they, like Persia were mtere^ed m the safety of the Persian Gulf for commerce, and that they would gladly have accepted Persia's co-operation in maintaining order had her naval position admitted ot t, but although they did not consider Persia's claims to ownership to be valul, y were not at that time directly concerned in refuting them, ' be special treaties by which they eventually agreed to accept the control of the sheikh s loreign relations were conciuded at a later date. . , . , i „ 11. I must in this connexion invite the Persian Government to take n( te the fact that there is no conceivable ground for the suggestion in the last 1 of the second section of your Government's note under reply that the indepen e status enjoyed by the rulers of Bahrein can in any sense be lepresen u as . of 'rebellion at a foreign State's instigation^ Tins suggestion is one ' , '' 1 1 Majesty's Government repudiate as entirely unjustifiable. When in ^ . on their suppression of the piratical activities of tbe independerit n c s oi _ trucial coast of Oman, they found it necessary to consider position in egai to Bahrein, nearly forty years had elapsed since the conquest ol this ^land bv t e ancestor of the present sheikh, and during those years Pcma bad exerci^d no dominion in the islands and appeared to have taken no measures to re-establish her position. They had accordingly no hesitation in entering into ' e ^t atioiis and concluding a treaty with the independent ruler without prior reference to the Govern ment of the Shah. Their object, as stated by Lord Clar ^on n 1869, vvas the suppression of piracy and the maintenance of peace in the Gulf they sti R confined themselves to the measures necessary to attain that object a mi.-ht have been open to them to establish their dominion over the ^eikh they did not choose to do so. but contented themselves with an idminis^ of international shipping without imposing on themselves the burden a li. tration They maintained this position not only in 1820 but on, other occasions subsequent years, and notably in 1848, when thw d^lined to ^ e to the h ^,kh s request that his dominions should be incorporated m those of Her Majesty the yueem Tho treatv of 1820 bv which the Sheikh of Bahrein bound himself to abstain t plmider and piracy by land and sea. from the slave traffic and from inter -tribal war was followed in 1847, in 1856, and 1861 by further treaties designed to secme tl e same objects—the suppression of slavery, and the general pacification o , ' these^reaties'wiUi'the'sheikfi 3 as^an^indepOTdei^niter, a^dTn^stently refused as 2±i'a?£: , i at e r period in 1880 and 1892. that they took upon themselves the unqiialifie liability for the foreign relations of that ruler, under which he has now invoked their assistance in repelling what he not unnaturally regards as a wholly unprovoked attempt on his independence by a foreign Government exnressing 12 In conclusion His Maiesty s Government cannot retrain trom expressing their surprise that the Persian ' Government should have referred m this InrresDondence to article 10 of the Covenant of the League of Nations, under which '' -trjs triix •» of Pprqian Gulf and over which Persia has exercised no authority for 14o years. Persian ^ be evident to the Persian Government that His Majesty s Govern ment in the United Kingdom have carefully weighed the arguments advanced iii the note now under replv, and that although they have found no reason ^ ! ' n &gt; t W Drevious opinions, their attitude is dictated by their genuine conviction that J V o f tho mate of 'B ihrein Thev are, indeed, hopeful that the Government eS^d^st^ Sicy they have long followed with friendly Acknowledge the desirability of establishing good relations with Persia smmm ■ ^ I neighbours, and, realising that their present antiquated claim cannot properly be sustained and is an insurmountable obstacle to the establishment of such good relations with the Government and people of Bahrein, will on further consideration desist from its pursuit. 14.

The result of our discussions on Henjam, Basidu and Wireless Stations are contained in a separate desx^atch. 4. As particularly affecting Kis Majesty^ ships we first went carefully into the question of the new Persian Quarantine regulations and discussed point by point ray telegram 11 o. 50 which summarised a recent letter frm the Minister of Court on the subject. The points especially raised by Captain Boyes and the result of our deliberations with the Minister of Court are contained I The 'Right Honourable Sir Austen Chamberlain K.G., M.P The Foreign Office.- 2 - contained in my telegram Ho. 78 vihich 1 showed to His Highness befoi'e despatch in order that there should be no possible misunderstanding. I am aware that the proposal of the Minister of Court that Commanding Officers should give to officers and men who do not land in uniform certificates of identity may outrage the feelings of the Admiralty; we argued the pojnt at length with the Minister of Court and explained to him t the international customs in this respect. His High ness replied that he was as anxious as xjix we acre to avoid any further incidents but owing to the inexper ience of the subordinate officials at the ports f)e begged that for the time being, pending the conclusion of the present negotiations, Captain Boyes would sub mit this propoioo-l. to the Admiralty and if it is not held to create an undesirable precedent 1 venture with all deference to express the hope that in the special circumstances this may be temporarily allowed. 5. I enquired of Captain Boyes whether it was necessary for His Majesty^ ships to pay frequent visits to the Persian ports of Bandar Abbas and Bushire He saia that his instructions were to keep in touch with His Majesty^ Consular Officers at the ports and especially the Political Kesiuent but apart from this hi had no desire to visit either of these ports more often than he could hdp and it was certainly no pleasure to visit ports where there was no proper harbour and little or nothing to do on shore. At Bushire especially a ship had to lie out a long way from the landing place, in fact, apart from ttanjiim, Abadan was the only Persian port where there were recreational facilities. 6. As it seemed possible that in the course of % our interview the Minister of Court might raise the question of contraband I asked Captain Boyes for any information he could give me on the subject. It appears- 3 - appears that at present the biggest centre is the Oulf for smuggling in Bahrain, but the traffic from the island is carried on almost entirely in ^angistani (Persian) vessels and not in Arab dhows. These vessels sail as a rule four or five together. If an armed Persian Customs launch is seen, the leadii? r boat takes a different course to act as a decoy. If it is then pursued, as appears usually to be the case, by the Persian Customs boat the remaining v vessels quietly pursue their way to the Persian coast there to land their contraband goods. 7 . 'Prom Dabai , on the o ther^iand, contraband traffic is entirely carried on by Arab dhows. The above facts were explained to Teymourtach who ex pressed great interest in the matter and when later we came to discuss the o^estion of Bahrain and i had explained to him the reasons why his recent proposal to seil to His Majesty's aovernment the Persian ^rights* to the island were quire impracticable, 1 ventured to express ay personal opinion that if His Highness was prepared to accept the suggestion of a balance sheet on which should figure as one of the of items the renunciation by the Persian Government/^their claims to Bahrain His Majesty's Government might be prepared to recommend to the Hhaikh that he should permit a duly authorised Persian Consul to reside in the island. 'H^e idea of a Consul appeared ^pery ■ pL acceptable to the Minister of Court as he would be in a position to give more of less accurate information to his Government on the subject of contraband tradTfic. 1 il His Highness then enquired whether it would be possible for the Persian Government to haYe a Consular A^ent at Dabai where it was understood there was a large mm Persian colony. Sir Frederick Johnston explained that there was no British Consular Agent there jam as it had never been considered safemm - 4 - '7 to send one and therefore he thought it most un likely that a Persian, a^ent would be allowed. It v;as admitted, however, that there were four or five thousand Persian subjects residing there. These had in the course of tirae migrated from Lingah but had prabably a greater strain of Arab than Persian blood. 9. We next spoke of Tamb and Abu Musa and the 'Resident remariced that with the assistance of the Senior Naval Officer he could probably guarantee that if the Persians renounced their claim to these islands neither of them would be allowed to become a depot for smuggling. The Minister took note of this and while apparently in no way prepared to renounce the Persian claim appeared Xsx disposed to consider a solution of the question on the principle of a balance sheet as in the case of Bahrain. 10. After two hours conversation on the 13th we got up to leave as His Highness had another engage ment but he invited ts to have luncheon with him on the following day to continue the diecussion and to give him the opportunity of raising one or two matters him self. Accordingly after luncheon on the 14th the His discussion was resumed and^Highness opened the pro ceedings by enquiring of the Hesiaent what he thought about the question of territorial waters it was difficult to know what to reply to this rather un expected leading question and 1 repeated Hrhat 1 had previously said that only a three mile limit was internationally recognised, and that if the Persians were to attempt an eight mile limit police control this, in the opinion of the Henior Naval Officer would be very likely to give rise to serious trouble with the Arabs who, if their dhows were unwarrantably interferred with on what they considered to be the high seas, might not unreasonably wish to take reprisals.- 5 - reprisals. One of the main objects of His Majesty's ships in the Gulf 1 added was to maintain peace and order. Kish His Highness at once said that he gratefully recognised this and that it was in the interest of Persia that thie^skould continue to do so. He then enquired in what way the Arabs mi^ht be expected to attempt reprisals if not held in check by His Majesty's ships. it was explained to him that a number of dhows might slip across together at night and burn a village, pillage and loot, and then retire. He said that in that case it would be for the Persian gunboats, when commissioned, to take the necessary precautions. 11• ^le conversation then became Somewhat in volved but I had the impression that His Highness had come to realise that if peace was to be maintained and Arab raiding to be stoxjped this would be mainly due to the efforts of Fis Majesty's ships and that therefore the continued presence of Hie Majesty's ships in the Gulf was also in the interests of Persia. if I am correct in this assumption 1 consider that the time s^ent over this discussion was not entirely wasted. 12. The Minister next enquired why the 'British flag continued to be flown on the flagstaff on Pernian territory at 'Rushire which was not a i^art of the Residency grounds. It was of course impossible to answer this except by saying that it had flown there for a very great number of years ^ which is no argument at all, and if said would only have been calculated to irritate His Highness. 1 had already discussed the matter with Sir Frederick Johnston who told me that any sudden removal of this flag would certainly create a bad impression on the Arab coast where it would be immediately known. i therefore avoided the question and remembering discussions which had taken place in the Per si an- 6 - /y Persian Gulf Sub Committee last October when Sir Samuel Hoare had himself raised this question l hinted on ray own authority and as a personal opinion that Hy Megestji's Government and the Governnent of India mi^ht possibly be willing to consider the JtB* separa tion of the functions of the Resident in the Persian Gulf and the Consul-General for the province of .wars and transfer the Residency to some place outside Persian territory. i do not think His Highness expect ed this as he expressed the aarmest appreciation of the idea. I had aaid that if this were to be done it Jtsax would only be in deference to Persian ausceptibilities. His Highness added that this mark of friendship on the part of His Majesty's Government would be most highly welcomed by the Persian Government. 1 thought it well to say that if His Majesty's Government should decide to do this they might wish the Hesident to pay periodical visits to Persian ports in order to keep in touch with the local Authorities and His Majesty's Consular Officers and 1 presumed that the .Persian Government would have no objection to this. He aaid, on the contrary, he thought such visits would be in out mutual interest, l then told him that Sir Frederick Johnston expected to pay a short visit to India next week when he would repeat what had been xxx said to the authorities there. His Highness express ed the hope that if Sir Frederick was going to dis cuss any of these matters ir India he would also discuss the question which had been raised in our first interview on Gulf matters on the subject of Lighting and Buoying in the Gulf and his proposal that a Conference migl t be held on the subject. 13.

S.W. 1. 23rd January, 1929. l!y dear Talton, You have no doubt been considering at the India Office the issues raised by Sir R. Olive's recent telegrani about Bahrein. 2. The view taken by 3ir Austen Chamberlain is that these problems can best be tackled by informal discussion in the first place between the India Office and the Forei^i Office, in the hope of reaching agreement on a course of action which could be recommended to the Persian Gulf Sub committee. I therefore write this letter to give you some idea of the lines on which our thoughts are running. 3. It is from every point of view a matter of increasing importance to get the Bahrein question settled and out of the way. ^ven if it were possible to leave the dispute unsettled (which has, after all, been the position for the last 100 years without anybody being any the worse), the fact that the Persian Government are now likely year by year to assert themselves to a greater extent in South Persia and in the Gulf landers the possibility of incidents more and more dangerous, and the necessity for reaching a solution more and more pressing. It is indeed evident that as soon as the Persians have warships at their disposal in the Gulf, the danger of aggrofision against Bahrein such as, for example, interference with shipping proceeding to Bahrein, will be enormously increased.' 4. It is quite certain that Persia will never abandon her claim merely as a rdsult of argument by correspondence, nevertheless we cannot afford to leave unanswered her notes, copies of which have been sent to the League of Nations, for our/ o*jl4 out silence would merely be interpreted as inability to answer the Persian arguments. There are now two Persian notes, those of August 2nd and January 5th, to which no replyhas yet been returned, and it seems necessary to proceed at once with the preparation of our reply. 5. But our main object must be, as indicated above, to tet the whole question finally settled, and this can never be done by exchange of notes. Broadly speaking, it can only be done in two ways - (1) by arbitration, or (2) by purchase of Persia's 'rights' 1 . 6. \ b regards arbitration, certain objections were formulated in paragraphs 39 and 40 of the Interim Report of the Persian Gulf Sub-Committee dated October 29th last. But there are special objections to arbitration in the case of Bahrein. Ridiculous as the Persian arguments are, it is nevertheless just conceivable that arbitral award would be given in their favour, and such an award would plstce His Majesty's Government in an absolutely impcssible position. If an arbitral award went against us, we should presumably be ooiripelled to stand aside, in spite of our treaty engagement tc the Sheikh and his legitimate claims to our protection, and ana to allo^ the Persian Government to occupy the Island/to deal with the Sheikh as they ma^y think fit. Bahrein is of great importance to us as a point on an air route to the East: but if we went to arbitration and lost our case, and had to abandon the Sheikh and our treaty obligations, we should lose far more than an air route to India: we should losa our whole position in the Forcian Gulf; and our position in the whole of the Middle i^ast would be affected. For these reasons it does not appear possible to agree to arbitration by a tribunal composed as suggestec by the Persian Minister of Court (see Olive's telegram No. 4, paragraph 2). A tribunal of three members, one of whom represented Persia and another the Sheikh, would leave/I n' 1 leave the issue to be decided by the third member entirely. We could scarcely allow such a grave issue to be decided by a single foreign lawyer, whatever his qualifications. It is, moreover, possible that forei©! nationals might be somewhat biassed against the present regime in Bahrein, where Germans are apparently not allowed to land at all, and where no foreign concern other than a British or Indian concern is permitted to hold oil concessions etc. 8. Persia is however suggesting in her official notes that the time has come for the matter to be decided by the League of Nations, and the question is one which may very possibly be raised and pressed by the Persian Jelegate at the League Council. Now the opinion has been expressed in certain quarters that His Majesty's G-ovemment ought not to allow Persian Gulf questions to be decided by the League of Nations, or by the Permanent Court of International Justice. Unfortunately, it is much easier to say that such questions are to be kept away from the League or the Court than to effect this result if Persia tries to take them there. If Persia were to bring the Bahrein question before the League Council, we cannot refuse to allow that body to attempt its task of conciliation; and it would be difficult to deny that the legal question raised is one which is suitable for settlement by reference to the Court. 9. Again, it had occurred to us that His Majesty's Government might conceivably take the line that (a) they have no objection to the Persian claims, such as they are, being examined by the Permanent Court, if Persia insists on such examination and is prepared to stand the cost; but (b) they cannot admit that there is the slightest legal justification for the Persian claims; and (c) in view of the history of the last 15 u years, and their treaty obligations to the Sheikh, they consider themselves perfectly entitled to/to defend Bahrein from outside aggreasion. Unfortunately, however, it is not poeeible to take thia line. he matter could only come before the Court in one of two ways; (1) on a reference to it. by agreement between eraia and ouraelvea. for a deciaion aa to the validity of Poreia s claima; (2) on a requeat by the League Council for an adviaory opinion. Course (1) could only be adopted with our conaent. but if we agreed to the case going to the Court we should, of course, have to accept the decision whatever it was. Course (2) implies that Persia would have brought the question before the Council, and that tne ouncil decided to obtain an advisory opinion from the Court in order to assist it in reaching a conclusion. If this were done the opinion of the Penaanent Court would, in this particular case, in fact settle the only question which arises; and if the opinion were adverse to our contention, it is unlikely that any member of the Council other uhan the British member would oppoae a decision by the Council in Persia'a favour. If. therefore, the matter went to the ermanent Court at all, it would be impoaaible for ua to refuse to accent and aubmit to any 'advioe- or deciaion which it gave; and moreover, aa indicated above, if -he matter ia not aettled by direct negotiation between us and Peraia. and ia acconiingly brought by Peraia before the Council, we could not argue that the matter ia unauitable for settlement by reference to the lourt. 10. All this shows the importance of discovering if possible some means of settling the question direct with Persia; and it seems from Clive's recent telegrams that the Persian Govenunent in their present mood are not unwilling to reach a compromise. As the Government of India say, if it is really true that all that the Persians are now seeking is a face-saver, we should obviously explore every/14./ -7 i every possible way of giving it. 11. We agree, however, with the Government of India that the latest proposal of the Minister of Court (Olive's telegram No. 4, paragraphs 4-6) is quite inacceptable, at least in its present form. We cannot possibly admit Persia'f 'rights' to Bahrein, ihere seems little doubt that any agreement reached on the subject woulc, by the Persian Constitution, require the sanction of the Majlis, and any agreement containing an admission of the Persian claim would merely result in our placing our whole case at the mercy of the Majlis; if they did not ratify the agreement, we should have given away our case hopelessly. Nothing else would in fact give the Persians a reasonably strong claim to the Island than such an admission on the part of His Majesty's Government. 12. 7e have, therefore, to consider whether it is possible to overcome this difficulty by so wording the proposed agreement as to avoid anything which could be taken as an admission that Persia possssses rights over Bahrein which she is in a position to cede. This objection would not apply if the treaty merely provided for the renunciation by Persia of all claims to Bahrein ' since to renounce a claim is not the same thing as to transfer one^ sovereignty), but perhaps a provision on these lines would not be sufficient to save the Persians' face. It may be, however, that it is really a question of wording more than anything else. 13. If you at the India Office do not agree with any part of the preceding observations, it Till evidently be useful to discuss the points on which you differ. Itj on the other hand, you agree generally, so much the better; we can proceed straight away to discuss the course of action to be recommended to the Persian Gulf Sub-Gonmittee.14, Do you think you could manage to come and talk the matter over with us some time next weeK t and if bo, would Tuesday, January the 2^th f at 3 .30 p.m. suit you? If so, I will try to get Malkin and some one from the League of Nations section oo attend. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) Monteagle.P.832. INDIA OFFICE,S.W.I. 28th January 1929. Dear Monteagle, Many thanks for your demi -official letter of the 23rd January, E. 170/53/91. Te shall he very glad to he represented at the Conference on Tuesday, the 29th January at 3.30. p.m., on the question of Bahrein. I think we are in general agreement with the v±er set out in your letter, and that there is no point to which I need make any lengthy reference here, we agree with the Government of India that if indeed all iaimourtache wants is a face-saver, every possible effort should he made to find one for him, and we are entirely with you in thinking that it is most desirable on general grounds to reach a friendly settlement of this Question without nringing in the League or having to go to arbitration (the objjec ions to which are in our view conclusive). If Clive's earlier optimian is justified and we succeed in getting what we want in Henjam, etc., without having to promise in return remission of the whole or part of the Persian Debt, that would in any event leave debt remission available for use in connection v ith Bahrein. But we should, I think, like to explore whether, in view of the critical importance of Bahrein, it might not be worth while earmarking remission of the whole or a part ol the debt as a concession to be used solely in return lor the withdrawal of Persian claims to it (Tamb and Abu Musa mirht perhaps be thrown in), and if the Foreign Office took this view, a recommendation to this effect might be made to the The Lord Monteagle,GK'lG. t MVO., . C.l.D. Foreign Office, 0 ).' 7 .!.C.I.D. We rocognise that such a decision would reduce the bargaining counters available to Clive tor general purposes, hut h^pahe his negotiations would not he very much hampered hy that fact at this stage since debt remission is a possibility which in any case presumably will not be mentioned until a critical stage has been reached, and the negotiations are nearing their close. It is, of course, as you ssy,essential that any agreement on the subject tould be so worded as to avoid anything which could be taken as an admission that Persia possesses rights over Bahrein which she is in a position to cede, or in fact any substantial claims. If any kind of separate docunent on the subject of Bahrein were con templated, it would seem extremely difficult if not impossible to find a formula which would at the same time be of any use to the Persian Government to enable them to save face with their own people, and also sufficiently 'without prejudice' to meet our requirements. It may, therefore, be best to have nothing in writing except in the final general treaty which would include, among all its other items, relinquishment of the Persian claims to Bahrein ( and we hope Tamb and Abu Musa) on one side and remission of the debt on the other. This is only what was contemplated from the start, hut the difference would be now that Clive would/have authority to talk about Bahrein, ascertain what Taimourtache regards asjan adequate face-saver, and let him understand that while we do not recognise that the claim has any sort of validity we should be prepared, on its relinquishment, to remit so much of Persia's debt. Taimourtache would then be able to represent to his public thsfc the latter represented the purchase price of Persia's 'rights' but nothing would at any stage have been put in writing which could be used against ub. Theli \ J The question of t«ctics is a difficult one . and we make su^estion regarding it with sane diffidence, for clearly considerable freedom of action must he left to Clive. But you will no doubt apree that any definite offerat too early a stage of readiness to compromise with Persia on the basis which we may in fact be prepared to adopt might lead the f inister of Court to raise his price• 'liat we are inclined to suggest is that Clive might be instructed to continue to maintain an uncompromising attitude and to repeat that his instructions are to regard Bahrein as outside the scope of the negotiations, but at the same tire endeavour to explore further the precise Implications of Taimourtache , s suggestion that the islands should be purchased with a view to taking the matter further with Hie Majesty's Government, But this is a point which we could perhaps more suitably discuss at the conference. We quite agree her^ that it is desirable to have a reply to both Persian Notes about Bahrein ready for despatch, the actualy moment of despatcr being left to be determined by developments at ~eneva or in the course of the negotiations. Laithwaite has been working on this on the basis of your letters to him of the 11th and 31st December, and we hope shortly to have a draft which might serve as a very rough basis for consideration.

[800 gg—1]2 (/'J?. -Vf ^ ^ 7 Enclosure 3 in No. 1. Lieutenant-Colonel Barrett to Secretary, Political Resident, Bushire. (Confidential.) Sir, Bahrein, April 7, 1929. I HAVE the honour to state that I have discussed the subject matter of your No. 66-S with his Excellency Sheikh Hamad and his son and brother. 2. The sheikhs admit that there is an advantage to. themselves in the appoint ment of a Persian consul in Bahrein as Persian recognition of the independence of the islands would be implied. On the other hand they consider that the disadvan tages far outweigh this one gain. 3. There is a numerous Persian colony in the island and some of its members are men of wealth and influence. Indeed the trade of Bahrein, apart from the pearl trade, is largely in the hands of Indians and Persians. Persians also provide the bulk of the labour at the customs jetty and in the markets. Some of tho richer Persians are Sunnis from the Bastak district, but the majority are Shiah. The sheikhs argue that the Persian consul would certainly be a Shiah, who, in the nature of things would use his official position and the prestige that it would give him to organise his co-religionists and compatriots in opposition to the Sunni Arab rulers of the island. The sting is in the fact that in addition to the Persian population, which at the outside estimate is not more than 10 per cent., there is a lar^e Arabic speaking Shiah population subjects of the Bahrein Govern ment, which is known as Bahreineh. The Bahreineh and Persian Shiah between them probably outnumber the Sunni Arabs 4. There is no love between Arab and Persian or between Sunni and Shiah, and in the past their mutual dislike has resulted in riots which have led to British intervention. The appointment of an official Persian consul would strengthen the hand of the Persian and Shiah party at the expense of the Arab Sunni party to which the rulers belong. 5. Asked on what lines they anticipate that the consul would proceed, the sheikhs pointed out the very considerable power and influence of the British political agent. They said they do not now object to this influence because the political agent is a European who has not got too intimate a knowledge of the manners and customs of the country and consequently holds himself, in some measure, aloof from the people in a social sense. His very incapacity to mix freely with the people is an advantage to him as it keeps him from entering into local intrigues and preserves his impartial ity. His own particular proteges, the Indian community, are, although powerful in point of wealth, small in numbers and peaceful by disposition. There is among the Indians none of the coolie^class which can be worked up into making physical assaults on the Arabs. The Persian coolie class is, however, unfortunately increasing rapidly in spite of all efforts to restrict its numbers. Clashes between this class and the Arab are of constant occurrence and police vigilance is always necessary to prevent those clashes from turning into riots. The Persian consul would certainly make it his business secretly to use these Persian coolies for his purpose. On arrival in Bahrein his first step would be to influence the present Shiah Qadhi, who is a conceited young man of 23. If not immediately successful the consul would engineer an agitation for a Persian Qadhi. This would not be difficult for him for so lately as November 1928 the Persian community put in a claim for the appointment of a Persian speaking Qadhi. The Persian Government would be careful to see that a first class 'Alim was sent to fill the post of Qadhi. The Shiah Qadhi and his Bahreineh followers would probably resent the arrival of the Persian 'Alim, but undoubtedly after some experience of the superior capacity of the Persian they would rally to his side. The sheikhs here stressed that the power and influence of a Shiah 'Alim, over his flock, is immeasurably greater than that of a Sunni Qadhi. Having once gained considerable influence through the Qadhi the next activity of the Persian consul would be directed towards the Shiah waqfs. These waqfs are of considerable value in the total and their number is large. Several of them could probably be traced back to the days of the Persian occupation of the islands. The sheikhs who have sometimes been guilty of high-handed treatment of their Shiah subjects in the past do not welcome too close a scrutiny of all Shiah waqfs.6. The sheikhs are certain that an officially appointed Persian consul would claim that the political agent's jurisdiction over Persian subjects should be trans ferred to him. This claim would promptly lead to a like claim by Ibn ^aud on behalf of the Nejdis and Hasawis in Bahrein. The Qusaibis, who would be Ibn Sand's official representative, would certainly use their increased influence to organise the Nejdis against the Persians, whom they hate. Sooner or later a serious clash w T ould ensue and as the combatants would be amenable to the jurisdiction of their own consul only, a very dangerous situation would arise. At present both Nejdi and Persian rioters would be haled before the political agent, whose interest it is to preserve the peace and who would deal out impartial justice. A situation of this sort actually arose in 1923 immediately preceding Sheikh Isa's relinquishment of control over Bahrein State affairs. 7. As a further example of the disadvantage to them arising from the appointment of a Persian consul, the sheikhs point out that an Arab s allegiance .is very elastic. Even at present interested parties attempt to claim the status of Bahrein subjects or British protected persons as happens to suit themselves at the moment. How much worse would the. situation become when there are three foreign jurisdictions in addition to that of the sheikh s own courts. They asked me further to consider the present factor. Qusaibi and the Persian would claim equality with the political agent, and were a new political agent appointed they might claim precedence over him. The sheikhs ask what they were to do in these circumstances. They would continually be bothered by recriminations between official representatives of foreign Powders who would number three at any rate and possibly more if France or Germany made a claim to representation. 8. Sheikh Mahomed informed me that Sheikh Isa was very interested in this question. Sheikh Isa pointed out that in the past the Turks had desired to appoint a consul in Bahrein, but he himself, relying on the agreement of the 22nd December. 1880, a copy of which he sent for my information, had been able to reject the proposal. If the British Government now recommend the acceptance of a Persian consul there is of course nothing further to be said except that he considers that it would be a great mistake, and he hopes His Majesty s (jovernment will recognise this fact. 9. If His Majesty's Government decide that in spite of this opinion to the contrary the appointment of a Persian consul is necessary, the sheikhs trust that he will be given no judicial powers of any sort, but will be enabled to make representations only. They are satisfied that any Persian consul would abuse his official position and thereby make their task more difficult, but at any rate his prestige and power of mischief would be lessened if he had no judicial powers. 10. The sheikhs of the ruling house feel very strongly in the matter and my own experience of Bahrein lead me to support their arguments. It is inconceivable that a Persian consul would not attempt to rally the Shiahs to his side. It is inconceivable that he would not intrigue against the authority of the A1 Khalifa sheikhs and thereby stir up disturbances which might lead to serious riots, from which the Persian Government would lose nothing and might gain considerable advantage. The appointment of a Persian consul would, in my opinion, undoubtedlv lead to a demand from Ibn Sand to raise the status of his agent Abdul Aziz Qusaibi to similar rank. Qusaibi even at present enjoys considerable power and influence over the weak and amiable Sheikh Hamad. ' The grant of official rank would increase this influence and I fear that a time would come when it may rival that of the political agent himself. The interests of Saudian consuls, equally with those of the Persian, would lead them to encourage disturbances in the hope of profit to themselves and the rulers they represent. No census has been taken in Bahrein, but I calculate that the number of Ibn Sand's subjects in these islands is greater than that of the Persians. At present the political agent, at Ibn Sand's own request, exercises jurisdiction over Ibn Sand's subjects, but the official recognition of a Saudian consul must lead to a demand for the transfer of this jurisdiction to his own official. I agree with the A1 Khalifa sheikhs in saying that Akhwan pressure would force Ibn Saud to interfere, through his consul, in Bahrein affairs to support the Sunnis against the Shiahs. Instances of attempted interference have occurredin the past but the power of the political agent has been sufficient to check intrigues before they became beyond control. I would point out that it was in great measure the enmity between Sunni and Shiah that led to active British intervention in 1904 and 1923. It was comparatively simple for the British Government to decide its course of action in these years, but I venture to suggest that the presence of foreign consuls in Bahrein would complicate the issue to a very considerable extent. The appointment of a Persian consul without judicial powers wthiM ease the situation to a certain extent, but I cannot imagine that the Persian Government, if officially represented in Bahrein, would consent to the continuance of the political agent s jurisdiction over Persians. It appears moreover from such correspondence as I have seen that the Minister of the Court in all his negotiations insists on absolute equality between Persia and Britain. In the circumstances it is for consideration whether the retention of the political agent's jurisdiction over British subjects, while jurisdiction over Persians was withheld from the Persian consul, would be acceptable to Persia. Finally, I venture to suggest that while the appointment of a Persian consul might be regarded by civilised nations and by a few educated persons in the Gulf as an acknowledgment of Bahrein's independence, to the ordinary Arab it would be merely a sign of the further advance of the Persians at the expense of Great Britain. At present to the inhabitant of Bahrein the British Government is the ' daulah '' while his own Government equally with those of other nations is merely ' hukumah.' It enjoys a superior status the signs visual of which are the political agent and his superior the Resident in the Persian Gulf. The appointment of the official representatives of foreign Governments would detract from this status and thereby increase the difficulty of the work of the British representatives. I have, &amp;c.

Remaining members of A1 Khalifa family are not so susceptibile to Bin Saud f s influence as Shaikh Hamad is. Any fresh treaty would probably be opposed by Shaikh Isa,supported in his attitude by certain anti- \3^ritish merchants. But he is at present personally friendly and his strong minded wife atka is absent on pilgrimage . I think his opposition could be overcome.

Your telegram asked if it would be possible to allow one leading member of the Persian colony to speak on the behalf of the others. • It did not say who would appoint this man and e%ctly what his position would be, and it is obvious that the appoinment could have very varying interpretations put upon it. 3. I am absolutely opposed to encouraging tie Persian com munity in any form. They are already far too aggressive, and what with flaunting their Pahlvai hats and their schools subsididised by the Persian Government { would the P.G. allow us to subsidise Muhamme^rh a «fEioa&gt;i m and let the boys wear Arab head gear and wave Arab flags ? ) they are a thorn in the flesh of the Political Agent and with the slightest eacouragement would cause real trouble. 4. It is just possible that if a friend og the Agency such as K.B.Muhammad Sharif were appointed he would not abuse his posi tion, but the history of the last ten years has shown us that the Persians have considered every concession given them as inadequate and immediately clamoured for more. We have so pande*ed to their ridiculous claim to Bahrein,^a claim less real than ours to New York,^that they have really come to feel that there is something in it and that they must really get something. Had we said directly they started persecuting Bahama at Muhammerah » Look here, we will let the Bahrain Government retaliate and turn all Persians there into Bahrein!s and close your schools and forbid the Pahlavi hat • they would have stopped at once. 5. You yourself have written so clearly and ably on the sub ject of a Persian agent at Bahrain that I feel it is unneccessary have for me to add anything to what you^sald except that I feel that the danger is as real however the Agency may be camouflaged. I hope&gt; ir3 : i that the Residency will be able to ward off the danger as they have done hitherto. I receive such alarming reports of the Shaikh's increasing invertebracy that I feel it would be the height of folly to add another to the powerful intriguers that go surround him. I am leaving by next mail, and will liy before then if Howe can give me a lift in his flying boat. Your sincerely !^4: 15/150, 19/191. aii/ia a n, l 51 / 16 Telegram P.

The negotiations with Pel's la x'e Bahrain have undoubtedly advanced a little as Taimourtaohe haa defin- -itely stated that Persia will be willing to acknowledge the independence of the Shaikh-Governors, but will require \ a quid pro iquo Vrom His Majesty's rrovernraent. At present the counter demands are excessive, amounting, when |! reduced to pounds sterling, to a sum which the Minister has worked out as approximating 3i million pounas utoyllw^; 3ir Kobert Olive has informed Taimoutrache that such a demand is preposterous and must be reduced. Taimourtache r is apparently prepared to reduce it and the question is now reduced to a bargaining match. In the meantime rr&gt; aimourtache has agreed to issue stricter ordex-s regarding the preservation of the status quo in the Gulf, and,although passport regulations stand, the position of the Bahranah at kohammerah has been considerably eased. They are no longer being bullied into taking out registration papers as Persian subjects ana are being freed from secret police supervision. I am still pressing for the grant of permission to Kaji Abood Bahrani for his return to Kohammerah and 1 expect shortly to hear that he lias returned. This would remove all the immediate grievances and the main question of the legal right of the British aovernaent to protect Bahrainis must remain for settlement in the Treaty. On the question of Persian representation in Bahrain I give you the following extract from one of Sir Captain 0. G. prior. Political Agent, Bahrain.ir TU Olive *3 clospatohea 'In paragraph 2i5 of his letter Teymourtaoho spe?ika of tbe Persian ^vemment liaving tho right to appoint their 'representative' in Bahrein to protect Persian interests. I explained to him that there oould he no question of » appointing a Persian Consul. The Shaikh of Bahrain would not hear of foreign Consuls. Bahrain was a small island and once a country appointed a Consul, half a dozen others might wish to do the same, the it Amerioanii to protect their missionaries, tho Germans to look after the occasional Gemmn ship that might c 11 th^ -er(£ and tso on. His Highness replied that it w; s precisely because he realised that there might he diff- -icultiea ahout a Consul that he h ,d used the word 'representative'. He went on to speak of the import- -ance of the Persian colony, of the Persian school, etc. I said that there were always apt to he unfortunate differences between the Lunni and Bhiah inhabitants of the island and that it was much best to leave it to the Jolitical Tieslaent to keep the peace. Finally he reduced his demand to one of the leading members of the Oolony being authoriseu to speak on their behalf and though he did not employ the word 'Agent' his request practically amounted to a sort of unofficial agent. I should be glad to loam whether it would be possible to meet his wishes in this modified form.' I have already, after consulting you, informed Government of the difficulties attending the appointment of a Persian representative to the Shaikh. They now ask if a representative accredited to Political 'gent can be pl\emitted. This would recognise the Political 'gent's right to protect Persians and I am myself inclined to accede to this request, especially as 3lr B. Olive thinks it would help to put matters through. 1 informed Zlti Bobert of the antagonism of the various Persian sections : nd he suggested that two representatives might be pormitted, one for Shiahs and one for Junnis. I await your reply to a telegram 1 sent you before sending a reply to the Government of India. l The wording of the articles in the proposed treaty affecting Bahrain are Article 1 . ^ II y aura palx perpetuelle amitle sincere entre les hautes parties contractantos et entre leurs successeurs respectifs.

The Persi ans wish to modify the wording a hit and the matter is under discussion. I want the lersins to recognise as categorically as possible Bahrain 's special treaty relations with us and not merely to recognise the ohaikh- ^vernors 1 'independence. If our special treaty relations are recognised the concession of our right to protect Jiahrainis. in Persia should more easily he oecureu. 7he right, as a matter of fact, does not mount to much since the abolition of capitulations. I do not anticipate any difficulty in getting the shaikh to agree formally to be guided by our advice in all important matters. The Government of India would like a formal undertaking to this effect signed by the Shaikh Just about the time the Persian treaty goes through. The latest date, given verbally by the Minister, is March nextI 4 * next Touti as you know, many dates for the aignint5 of the Treaty have heen fixed in the paat* I -jn sorry you were unable to come to BusUlre while the Minister was here, hut as a matter of fact he now looks upon the Bahrain at^ioles as easy of disposal 9 and was more interested in the other clauses.

Vis-a-vis Sheikh absence of reference would not pre sumably giA r e rise to exaggerated idea of independence of us t It might however be advisable to prepare ground in advance of signature of Persian Treaty for action to regularise our position in Bahrein, e.g., on lines suggested in your telegram No. 1613-S. of 7th May. I shall be glad to know your views to enable matter to be further considered here, (h) Persian representative. I think sub ject to your views and those of Political Resident, compromise might be found in arrangement finally accepted by Taimourtache, see paragrapli No. 19 of Olive's despatch, but an informal arrangement to which reference would not be made in treaty seems desirable, (r) Please also let me know if we are in a position to give assurance on the lines proposed in third sentence of Persian counter draft subject to reciprocity for Bahreinis in Persia f If so, do you see any objection 1 Prima facie there would be advantage in this if practicable. 5.

XiETTER from the IIoN 'rle the political resident in the persian gltlf, No. 469-S. of 1929, dated Bushire, the 25th September 1929. Subject :— Ownership of Tan b and Abu il/ us a. With reference to His Majesty's Minister at Tehran's despatch to the Foreign Office, London, No. 454 of the 31st August last [Enclosure of Serial No. (301)], I have the honour to forward for the information of the Government of India a copy of my letter to His Majesty's Minister at Tehran, No. 138 of even date. Letter from the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian^ Gulf, to H. M.'s Minister, Tehran, No . 138 of 1929, dated the 25 th Septem ber 1929. 1 have the honour to refer to paragraph 8 of your despatch No. 454 of 31st August 1929 [ Enclosure of Serial No. (301)], to the Foreign Office, relating in the ownership of Tanb and Abu Musa. looufd, 7}] e P oints 011 w ^ich you would appear to desire to learn mv views fall under the tollowmg heads :— (a) The population of the islands of Tanb and Abu Musa and the extent to which the former is used as a regular depot for smuggling ; (b) The likelihood of the Shaikh of Shargah agreeing to hand over Tanb to the Persian Government ; (1) in return for a Persian acknowledgment that Abu Musa belongs ■o Shargah, (2) in return for a sum of money. 2. I have consulted the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf Division, who agrees with the following observations :— (a) The population of both Tanb and Abu Musa varies with the season. In winter the population of Tanb is estimated to be 25 Arabs and 4 Persian men exclusive of families. The Persians include the Shaikh's servant who is entrusted with the task of hauling up the Shaikh's flag and two employed as water carriers for the light house staff. In the summer the Persians remain on the island, but all the Arabs leave for the pearl fisheries. Their wives and families go to Khasab or Bakha on the Arab Coast. The population of Abu Musa is 50 Arabs, 2 Persians and 3 Baluchis, but in summer the Persians and Baluchis remain on the island but all the Arabs except two—left as guards—depart for the pearl banks. H. M.'s ships have had Tanb under observation for some considerable lime, and Captain Boyes states definitely that not the slightest sign of its use by smugglers has been seen. He adds that as Tanb is an open anchorage, too close to the starting point on the Arab Coast and not close enough to the distributing centres, the smugglers, who incidentally are almost all Persians, would not use it as a depot. The Senior Naval Officer reports that owing to the better surveil lance exercised on the inland trade routes leading from the Gulf ports, the smuggling business has to a considerable extent shifted to Barkhat Khan's territory. Bandar Sirik is now a popular entrepot. (b) Although Sir Percy Cox made an agreement with Shaikh Saggar bin K ha lid of Shargah in 1912, whereby the latter agreed to the con struction of a lighthouse on his island of Tanb, the island at present belongs to the Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah and not to the Shaikh of Shargah. The exact date on which the ownership changed hands is difficult to ascertain ; but it is a fact that Shaikh Sultan bin Salim of Ras al Khaimah now claims the island and that his flag fiies on it. He has, moreover, recently made a complaint to the Residency Agent that he is receiving no share of the revenues derived from ships passing the Tanb lighthouse. The Shaikh of Shargah claims and actually exercises certain rights— including the flying of his flag—on Abu Musa, but he does not ques tion the Ras al Khaimah claim to Tanb. The two Shaikhs are, of course, closely related, both being off-shoots of the same Jowasmi stock. In the past Ras al Khaimah and Shargah have sometimes been under one ruler. If the Shaikh of Shargah were asked to consent to the transfer of Tanb to the Persian Government under either of the conditions (1) or (2) mentioned, he would state that the island was not his property. As Abu Musa belongs to Shargah, the Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah would certainly refuse to forego his claim, about which he is very insistent, in return for the waiving of the Persian claim on the Shaikh of Shargali's island. I do not think he will accept any sum of money which Persia is likely to offer for Tanb. He is a man of obstinate and suspicious temper and will suspect the motive of any offer he may receive. The lighthouse which the British Government built on the island gives it a considerable importance to us ; and the Shaikh has recently been persuaded by some busy body that he can obtain large revenues from it.237 Copies of lliis letter are being sent to the Government of India and to iJie Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf.

Enquiry has been made by Secretary of State as to whether we are in a position to give assurance on these lines subject to reciprocity for Bahrainis in Persia, and if so whether there would be any objection. He considers that prima facie there would be advantage in this if practicable. Government of India would be glad to receive your views by telegram. (317) Telegram P., to H. M .'s Secretary of State for India, London, No. 3071-S. t dated the lol'h october 1929. We agree with paragraph 20 of Minister's Despatch No. 439 [Enclosure of Serial No. (296]. Timourtache's attitude over Tamb and Abu Musa in para graph 23 of his letter is quite unreasonable. This applies no less to his para graph 28 about Sirri as for Treaty purposes all three islands are linked up inextricably. Timourtache's object seems clearly to manoeuvre us into a posi tion in which with Sirri summarily excluded spirjt of reasonableness would tempt us to split the difference over the other two islands. But abandonment of Sirri simply in consequence of our long tacit acquiescence of Persian occupation is utmost weakening of Arab case we could dare contemplate. Persian offer to buy Arabs out of Tamb would have the advantage of implying their recognition of existing Arab rights. It would however be dangerous for us to pass offer on to the Sheikh unless it were really substantial for lie has already suspicions of our motives, vide Bushire letter of 25th ultimo to Tehran forwarded by this air mail. Incidentally Persia's real or pretended belief that Tamb is or could bo used as smuggling depot, seems according to expert naval opinion to be finally disposed of by this letter.

(319) Confidential Letter from the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, No. 470-^., dated the 25th September 1929. Subject :— Treaty relative to Persian Gulf questions. With reference to the correspondence ending with this office endorsement, No. 407-S. of the 6th September last [Serial No. (300)], 1 have the honour to forward for the information of the Government of India a copy of my despatch to His Majesty's Minister at Tehran, No. 139 of even date. confmential letter from the uon'ble the political resident in the Persian Gulf, to His Majesty's Minister Tehran, No . 139, dated the 25 th September 1929. T have the honour to refer to your despatch No. 101, dated the 27th August 1929 [Enclosure of Serial No. (300)], and to state after consultation and in agreement with the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf Division, the following comments are submitted for consideration. 2. I have no comments to make on sub-paragraphs (a) and (d) of para graph 3. His Highness' objection to the grant of postal facilities is not, in the opinion of the Senior Naval Officer, of much moment. At present postal matter intended for His Majesty's ships in the Gulf is handed over to the Commanders of the British India mail steahierfc, addressed Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf ; Commanding Officer, H. M. S. ' Lupin ', Persian Gulf, as the case may be. As the general address ' Persian Gulf ' is employed and no port is men tioned by name. His Majesty's ships are able to take delivery at any place or through any agency that they may wish. Mails are frequently received in the open sea, il the mail steamer is met. So long as, Persian attention is not drawn officially to this practice it will probably be allowed to continue. As regards sub-paragraph (c) : the Senior Naval Officer points out the absurdity of enforcing quarantine rules strictly against His Majesty's ships which each carry a doctor and which, owing to their rigid discipline, are pro- b:ib]\ the cleanest ships in the world, while no attempt isvinade to enforce them against dhows, which are a very likely source of infection. During his last visit to Hen jam, the harbour was full of Indian dhows proceedino- to the Shatt-al-Arab to purchase dates. 4. As regards the Court Minister's letter, dated the 20th August and the accompanving dratt, 1 have to submit the following comments :— Paragraph 17 of the letter. —There is only one British cemeterv at Basidu. T recommend that if it is impossible to obtain the right to look after it our selves, we should retain the right of inspection. Dtaft At tide 1. Xo map of the leased area accompanied your despatch. Article Although the sanitary clause of your original draft Article 5 has been retained, the clause as to the protection of British Government pro perty has been omitted. It is recommended that either the British or the 1 ersian Government be definitely entrusted with this responsibility. It is also recommended that the right to maintain ' depots de charbon et 'de vivres should be obtained. At present a ' depot de charbon ' oiilv is mentioned Numerous stores for ships other than coal and oil will have 'to be keut at Henjam. ^ i 8 ^ ested tlmt tlie words ' and for their canteens ' should be added after for their own use (pour lours pronres besoins) ' As the 1 ersians are adept's at inventing new imposts the addition of the words ' and tn-w nnnlognes) ' after ' exempt from customs duty and ilom load tax is suggested.240 Your original wording would appear preferable to ' Les importations et les exportatious en general ' in the final paragraph oi this Article, i le x a\&gt; do not wish any interference with their right to import, ior niritance, tobacco for their own uoe, because Persia has imposed a monopoly. Article 5. —Unless auxiliary vessels are included as in your original diatt the crews of colliers, oilers, etc., are penalised. Dilferential treatment in this respect will probably cause trouble with thcii crews in tiie lutuie. The Persian local authorities are causing trouble at Henjam over the em- plovment of a Naval tallyman. In order to prevent any interference m the future it is suggested that the right oi His Britannic Majest\ to emplo&gt; whomsoever he wishes in the Coal and Store Depot should be specifically granted. The Senior Naval Officer stresses this point owing to ' frequent and bitter experience Article 7. As explained above, it is somewhat illogical that quarantine should be applied to His Majesty's ships and not to country craft. Vou have alreadv obtained a modification of this Article, but the Senior Naval Officer would prefer that the Quarantine Medical Officer himself should be required to board the ships in accordance with the existing agreement it your original Article 7 cannot be restored. In any case the words ' which must take place at regular hours ' are open to objection. His Majesty's Navy consider the twentyfour hours 1 of the day to be regular hours. In an emeigencv a limita tion of the right of entry to hours of daylight might be fraught with danger. Article 5—The la'st paragraph which compels His Majesty's (Government to surrender a wireless station ' fulfilling the technical conditions of the times contains what may be a very serious commitment in view of the possibilities of wireless development within the next twenty years. Article 5.—The Senior Naval Officer would like to add auxiliary vessels to His Majesty's warships and those of the Royal Indian Marine. The prohibition against the permament stationing of any vessel in this roadstead will be interpreted to prevent the maintenance of oil barges ; and the Senior Naval Officer points out that to fix a limit of seven days effectually prevents the use of the harbour for the very necessary operations of boiler cleaning and overhaul of machinery. He suggests the substitution ot some such phrase as ' but no armed vessel shall be permanently stationed in the harbour '. Article 11. —The use of the word ' reviendront ' (will revert) seems open to objection as the buildings and installations have never been Persian property. It is noticed that no provision has been made reserving to His Britannic Majesty the right to use and maintain the British cemetery at Henjam. In Articles 3 and 4 of your original draft the words ' facilites actuelles ' are used to cover all those rights and privileges now enjoyed by His Majesty's Navy at Henjam, which it is necessary to conserve in the future. These words have been omitted in the Court Minister's draft, but it is strongly recommended that they may be restored in some form in the final draft. Experience has shown that Persian officials interpret documents with attention to the letter and not the spirit. Unless the rights of His Majesty's Navy are adequately safeguarded in advance the Persians, by cunning interpretation may attempt to make the treaty quite valueless. For instance, they may produce a wholly fictitious rate of wages for coolies and insist upon payment of^ these rates— tlio Postmaster, who is acting as Deputy Governor, is showing signs of adopt ing this course. They may produce curfew regulations as was threatened last autumn. They may prevent the use of good, honest and loyal men and compel the employment of men acceptable to themselves. They may foment strikes among the coolies. The Senior 4 Naval Officer suspects that the present Deputy Governor has already made a move of this sort. They may hamper good contractors and demand that contracts should be given to men pleasing to themselves. It is recognised that it is quite impracticable to cover such a number of points in a treaty, but they are here mentioned to support the restoration to the treaty of some such words as ' facilites actuelles '. 5. Copies of this despatch are being sent to the Government of India and to the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf Division.241 (320) Telegram P., from the Politicat. Resident, Bustiire, N'o. 998, dated the 11th October 1929. I think it preferable that Persia should acquire her Naval force under British auspices. British training should give Persian personal (personnel ?) a British outlook and presence of His Majesty's ships reacting on the Persian Gulf which will act as a model should accentuate this tendency. A pro-British spirit in the Navy should have good effect on the Persian coast officials and lead to general oiling of wheels of Anglo-Persian relations in the Gulf including the relations with Arabs which might be (group undec.) by an Italian training of personnel ? It is unfortunate that twenty Persians are already under training in Italy but the issue should not be affected by this. (Group undec.)

LC611FD—37—17-10-29—GIPS^7 9 Dear Colonel, I have discussed the matter of a Persian spokesiaan or apokesmen with Belgrave, and he shares iny opinion. The Persians hMre have nefer felt or found any diffi- culty in bringing forward any grievance to my knowledge, and they would fare no better with spokesmen. The appointment is unnecessary and wills imply cause trouble, how grave the trouble, will be hard to estimate. The appointment, if for reasons uf policy some con cession is insisted upon by the Government of .India of one man would be fatal. In 1911 without any encouragement or support the late Haji Abdul Nabi Kazeruni fxew a a- J eii..ian Jlag over his house ana styled himseldT Consul, and were any one man y ; singled oui (he would almost certainly be Abaul Habi rushiryJ he would certainly get his community tu call him consul, ana would stick up a large flag pole in the night as Hespers did, and we should have unpleasant scenes removing it again. Also | the Uajdis would instaitly demand similar privileges, and I tremble to think what qusaibi could achieve wi th a little more encouragement. If Government insist, against my acivice, on appointr ing spokesmen, the harm can be lessened oy appointing sevtxal. It is essential that they should not be appointed by the Persian Government, who already have some backdoor corres pondence with Banrain, and this can be avoiaed by making oi.e 4 members of the Majlis el Urfi, am the two Baladiyyah mem* bers BJbcXiuLxM&amp;^pbLSLX and forming them into a group o; spokesmen . Their mutual grudges will prevent their becoming a serious menace. Their appointment would imve to be made bery un ostentatiously, and in advance of any general treaty. Even so, there is nothing to prevent the flajais from asking £or a similar concession, and we would tnen iiuve another- 2 - another hostile body, but one far more homogenous and far more dangerous* 1 see no reason whatever for this concession tou the Persians. They liare a privileged position here as it is, and enjoy all manner of concessions which the Bahama in Persia have to do without. They are fully pepresented un all local bodies, and particularly on the IJaJlis el Urfi. Their two members on the baladiyyah in Manama will probably be increased to four in the near future, ana 1 thinli that they lose no opportunity of airing whatever views they fell the situation demands. I repeat, that if the Cfovermoent of India wish to make this concession, against my advice, the least harm will be done if we ensure that uhe Persian Government cannot choose the spokesmen, ana that they pe^resent as many diverse elements as possible. 1 will not take any responsibility for the results that may follow the appoint ment of these spokesmen. Yours sincerely, SD/ C. G. PRIOR. Apart from our own policy, it woula not be fair to give one of the three or four mutually hostile bodies the sole right to represent the otthers.A * Ik lo. 126 C.

Clive (Tehran), (No. 244.) Sir, Foreign Office, May 23, 1929. I TRANSMIT to you herewith three drafts prepared in the India Office for an article, regarding the status of the Islands of Bahrein, to be included in a general treaty between Great Britain and Persia. '■ 2. You will have observed in the Government of India's telegram of the 7th May, which was repeated to you direct under No. 73 T, the suggestion that, if Persia demurs to the inclusion of such an article in the treaty, it might suffice for the Minister of Court to write a letter implying Persia's recognition of the independent status of Bahrein. I should be extremely reluctant to agree to the adoption of this suggestion, except possibly as an alternative that might be adopted in the last resort if all attempts to secure Persian agreement to an article in the treaty fail. A letter on the lines proposed might easily be disavowed by subsequent Persian Governments and lead to a revival of the Persian claim. It is essential to take the opportunity afforded by the present negotiations to endeavour to settle this question once and for all. 3. For these reasons I consider it important to make every endeavour to secure the inclusion in the treaty of an article on the lines of one of the three enclosed drafts. Draft ' A,' a simple relinquishment of Persia's claim, would, in the opinion of the India Office, be adequate. Draft ' B,' by which Persia recognises the independence of the Sheikhs of Bahrein and their special treaty relations with His Majesty's Govern ment, might, however, be preferable, as it would make it impossible for Persia at any future time to support a claim to the islands by some third party, and also prevent her from pursuing a policy of non-recognition similar to that which has given rise to so much difficulty in the case of Iraq. Draft ' B ' also appears preferable to draft ' C,' which has been prepared on the same lines and with the same object in view, but which only refers to the independence of the sheikhs in an indirect manner. 4 On the whole it seems undesirable to put forward a succession of proposals for the draft article lest the eventual acceptance of one, after the rejection of several others, might result in fixing a restrictive interpretation on the proposal finally accepted, it may be desirable to concentrate from the first on either draft ' A ' or draft ' B,' whichever is, in your opinion, the most likely to be accepted by the Persian Government. 5. I am, however, prepared to leave to your judgment which of these proposals can best be put forward to the Minister of Court. I am, &amp;c. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN. Enclosure in No. I.

Persians would not object to this as it would make smug; ling even more profitaole than at present. It would not seem practicable to provide fol in all Arab States. Trucial Sheikhs for instance enjoy complete internal independence subject to fufilment of treaty negotiations and we have ourselves no custo s agreoment with them. Insertion of most favourea nation clause in treaty with Persia covering them would I think arouse grave apprehensions and he regarded as sign of our intention to interfere more acttaely in future.

Letter from feroughi, Persian Ambassador at Angora, to the Hablul Matin on the question of Bahrein.** Extraot from the Tehran newspaper 'Iran' of the 18th Deoemher, 1929. The following letter regarding Bahrein from i'erou^hl, the preeent Persian /imbaetador in Angora and the ex-?rlme lilnliter, hae been pabllehed in the Mablul Matin of E6th Korember 1929. 'Sir, In yonr ispue Ko. 36/37 an anonymoue letter under the title n ' hey have loet Bahrein' wa» reproduoed, the burden of which was that the Persian representative who. the writer alleged, waa charged with the question of Bahrein in the League of Hatione, had been beguiled by the English diploma tie te and advised his foverniaent to withdraw the question from the League anrt leave it to be settled by friendly negotiation between the two governments oonoerned, and if no settlement was reached the question was to be referred to the Tntemational Court of Justice. As the Crovema&amp;nt was obliged to conqply with the su^estion of its Representative, the question of Bahrein remained, as heretofore, in suspense. The editor of the Hablul Matin considered that this letter would be like a bomb-shell and asked his reporters to give their news about this question. I am not in the habit of defending myself in the Press, and I am of the opinion that if I do my duty properly it will eventually be known and if I make mistakes admonitions will be my punishmsnt. In this case, however, I find the contents of the letter in question to be prejudicial to the Persian rJovernment and to the policy of my country, and as I presume that the Persian Govern ment perhaps is unwilling to enter into argument regarding this question, I feel it incumbent apon myself to explain the matter to the public. In90 - E - In the first plaoe I have to eay that enpnoBlng that I ehoald hare made any 8u#£e«tloni» aod exhorted my Sordrcffient to leave the queetlon in srieoonee, the ^ov^rnnient ^ae in no way obliged to asoept my mi^^eetion, 'he liea^e of latione and other politioal eirolee havb ro Beorete and myBteriee of which the Fereian f^overnrnent ia if^aorant and the Persian Oovyrnment therefore is not bonnd to aooent my prcootfale. It ie trne that T enjoy the oonfidenoe of ray rJovernment bit i^ mnst be remembered that I am a man and every raan ia liable to make mistake b . The Persian ^vernnaent no matter how nmoh oonfidonoe they put in me will therefore ooneider deeply all the proposals whioh I may submit to it. As regards the question of Bahrein I have to assert that it has never been deoided to diaouss this ^aeation in any of the sessiions, sittings, or oonnoile of the Leasrue of Hatione and therefore I have never tried to shelve the matter and as far as I am aware the Persian Government have never had tho idea of referring the qusetion to the L&lt;Mirt3e» Likewise I have never been eocxmissioned to disoaes the matter in the sittings of the Lea^Tzs and I have never been a eked for advice in this respeet as to Aether the matter should be referred to the League or not. Th^refora there has been no reason why I should have exhorted the Government to shelve this question. It does not taalter to nte where the oorres ondsnts of the paper obtain th^ir news, or wbat they report, the reroian 1k)vemmant authorities are my witness that I have never interfered in the matter whether in favour of referring it to the League or the opposite. In conclusion I have to say that I fear in nc way what the Press may publish or that it may think that I am dissociating myself from a policy of my Government with which I may disa/^ree but I must say that I am completely in a^eement with my Oovernmont in that so far it has not referred this question to the/O/ - 3 - th« Lea^uo and thlB aujet be alaar to woll-informud polltiolane. If 1 thought that tay ^OTerriaent In not raferring this mattar to the League, h&amp;d taade a mistake, I should oertalnly hay© cxpniBEed my opinion on tlie mattar, but I had no need to do this as tha reasons ara so olear. I do not say that tha question m*y 9im*&lt;;r be referred to the League - that depends on future oiroumstanows - but if it did happen that it was found neoeesary to do so, I am oertain ^ha irersian Ooremiaent will not let tha oooasion slip and if I should be at that time tho KeprttBentativ« of the Persian OoTernmant I should aot in the interests of wy oountry.(■ C S® ^ /f / Telegram No. 197-b., dated the 2lst January 1930, From...

Would there be any difficulty in persuading Persia to accept in respect of goods an undertaking to grant most favoured nation treatment qualified by such a reservation as that contemplated in favour of Hejd.

I HAVE the honour to enclose herewith translation of a note which I have received from the Persian Government protesting against the grant of an oil concession by the Sheikh of Bahrein. The protest is based on an article which appeared in the Near East' of the 5th June. , r i , i- j 2. At my interview with Feroughi yesterday I asked mm. to reconsiner tms protest and to'take back his note. I said he must realise that it was ridiculous. Did the Persian &lt; lovernment claim that no act of the Sheikh was permissible without the authority of the Persian Government ? If so, they could hardly expect us or anyone else to take such pretensions seriously. ^ • , • o. Their original protest was based on a reference to Bahrein being marie in a treaty between Great Britain and Ibn Saud. One might say that this protest nuestioned the right of the Sheikh of Bahrein to be the Sheikh of Bahrein. 4 As Feroughi declined to withdraw his note on the ground that he bad been instructed by the Council of Ministers to send it, I said 1 would forward to you a translation, hut 1 held out no hope that any reply would be sent. _ 5. Copies of this despatch, with its enclosure, are being sent to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India and to His Majesty's consul-general at Bushire. I have, &amp;c. K. H. CLIVE. Enclosure in No. 1. M. Feruughi to Sir B. Clive. M 7e n Mtni 0 stre, Murdad 1, 1309 {July 23, 1930). ACCORDING to the report published in the 'Near East' and the Times of Iraq ' (respectively) of the 5th and 18th June last, as well as in other papers, the concession for exploitation of the oil of Bahrein has been obtained from the Sheikh of Bahrein by an English syndicate, and that Major Frank HolmcS^), a representative from the latter syndicate's now carrying on his work in the said island. In view of the fact that the island of Bahrein is an inseparable part of the Persian Empire and that the right of sovereignty of Persia on the said island is indisputable, a fact which has fully been proved to yo ir Excellency's Government and to the League of Nations in the course of (my ?) letters ol the ^bth November, 132^, and the 2nd August, 1028 (respectively ?), and that even the explicit recognition made bv your Excellency's Government in 1860 of the right of sovereignty of Persia on the said island has been reminded, my Government emphatically protests against (^the errant of) the concession referred to above as well as to any other concession which may have not been given direct by my Government in that island and considers the same entirely invalid. And in view of the regard which 1 know your Excellency's Govern ment has for the rights (of others), my Government much regrets to find itself compelled to repeat, from time to time, these kinds oi protests with regard to this particular case. i j • i r t&gt; It is obvious that such steps and overlooking of the established rights of Persia cannot affect the indisputable rights of Persia on Bahrein, and that my Govern ment reserves for itself the right of claiming and recovering any kind of anticipated profits accruing to the said concession as well as of making up for any losses which may be incurred in this respect.

Take, for instance, this question of Bahrein on which the Persians have seen ht to address tic League in a note at once chirpy and unctuous. The real issues cf this dispute are completely falsified by treating them on a Covenant basis. For more than a century, when Persia was stagnant in its millennial decay, we have policed the Persian Gulf. Wc have sup pressed piracy and the slave -trade ; we have spent vast sums of money iji buoying and lighting those slumbrous reefs; we have brought trade and prosperity to back ward peoples. Never did the Persians question the exer cise of an authority which rendered them sueh benefit. But now that the work has been done they come whining to Geneva and question the title deeds of the property which we have rescued from the waste. Best of Both Worlds. Let me tell a simple story which illustrates the point exactly. Eight miles from Teheran, upon the wooded slopes of the Elburz, stands the village of Gulahek, the summer residence of the British Legation. A hundred years ago this village and the adjoining woods were presented as a fief to the British Minister. For a century our rights over the district have remained undisputed. They have been used to secure the amenities of the Minister's summer residence. We have exercised bene ficent contB'oI in such matters as sanitation and building over an area scarcely greater than a mile. The Persians recently asked to see the title deeds. An old rescript of the Shah was dis covered couched in such flowery language as to be unintelligible. The Persians insisted on applying to the inevitable imprecisions of a past century the exactitude of a modern lease. Such procedure lacks both sense and equity. —— 1. to th let is pl« th« th in th d&lt; th su F II pa de Cb SU} en' alt I hi le If n 6 h* ti d. th tii d I F t &gt;0 US. 6 \a (luL11 if l-v/ I Ho. 149 B ritish L egation, T ehran, 5 nt ember 2ord 19 3 0 .

The incident, the paper says, began with the note of the Persian Government to are at Britain dated some two years a^o by which Persia prored beyond all doubts her aoverei #i rights over Bahrein# Some months ago the oil concession was granted to ;iajor Jlolmes by the local sheikh and Persia protested at once against this unwarranted assumption of authority by the heikh* If British papers had not started a loud clamour against the so-called unsubstantiated rights of Persia over Bahrein, the Persian press vaould not have taken up the matter in retaliation. Jhe snglish press character ises pex'sia's efforts to assert her rights over a part of her territory as ridiculous; the Persian press wishes to know, with all due respect, on v'hat grounds does Great Britain claim a ri^ht of intervention in the affairs of Bahrein and by what treaty or convention does areat Britain maintain that Persia should relinquish her soverei^a rights over Bahrein ? fo ;ai unbiassed observer, it is still more ridiculous to observe the silence of the British press in the face of the violent lan.^uage used by the French and American iress when the latter protest against the unflinching coercion used by the British Government on Indians and Egyptians who are patriotically striving to recover their independence, detract from the Shafagh&gt;i--urkh a io. 1588. The paper deals in the leading article with the auestion of Bahrein with vehemence. It gives a history of the contro versy and comments more or less on the lines of the paper IranIK o CI Xran. It adde that a atudy of the history of British policy in the Oulf, of the genesis of these j ^ah states ruled hy puppets called sheikhs and the trieks played on the latter by the British GoYemment undercover of the so-called conven tions will at once convince everybody of the futility of the boasted claim of the British press regarding British Justice and civilisation. such study will show that these are eiapjy ^oaots and that the British Government is unique in its decoy itfulness and odious ways, Phe paper adds that now that the British Press seems to be labouring under a wrong im pression of this so-ealled civilisation propagated by Oreat Britain in the Oulf and Persia, we muct proceed to give them soae explrBfctlon with ragarfl to this much talked of «lft of clvl1i satlon. The paper then quotes the saae pus a age e already reproduoefi In the Iran of the British i -ress about the JBahrein controversy.fl Tran»Xatlon» aitraot from the Iran of beptamber 16th. Ho. 2531. The leading article again deals eopiously with the Bahrein question commenting on the passages quoted from various English papers* The allusions made by the ^ening Standard to the South Persia kifles as a raluable service to Persia and to the lessons in commeroe given hy (ireat Britain to Persia are riiiiouled by the editor^ Ee st^ys that far from being an assist anoe to Persia, the formation of the South i?ersia Hifles in the South was a direct blow to the sovereign rights of Persia and was an effective step towards the conriuest of ♦ira^ v^iich now forms a strong outpost of India not to talk of the economic advantages accruing to her as a mandatory power* But, what sort of connection can there be between these services and Persia^ claim over Bahrein ? The paper then turns to the passage in the 0aily Telegraph alluding to the notes exchanged between British and Persian aovemments over Bahrein and the dexterous way {as termed by the English paper) by which 3ir Austen Chamberlain repudiated all evidence put forward by Persia* fhe paper quotes a passage from the note from Sir Austen Chamberlain dated January 18th 19^8 and then analyses the passage in the follovdng way ; 1/ Persia's claim over Bahrein is worthless from geographical and ethnological points of view* 2/ His Britannic Majesty's Oovernmont admits that Bahrein was conquered and held by Persian troops during some part of the 17th Century and at the end of the 10th century. 3) me invasion of Bahrein by the Arab tribes during 1783 put an end to the Imperial Oovemment's rule over Bahrein which has never since been resumed* One is apt to ask \tiether Bahrein, if not belonging to Persia, belongs to Great Britain on geographical and ethnoj 0 6ioal]V&gt; ogloal groun&lt;ie. If the islandl does not belong to Persia with even more reuaon It doe# not belong either to England and geographical and ethnological dleahilitlea cited in the caae of Persia hold good with the saae force in the caee of Egypt, India aid Iraq md many other territories ^iere Great Britain holds sway, Bahrein has always and uninter ruptedly - save for con rueat by the Portugese from 15o? to 1622 - been under Persian undisputed rule and the local influence of the Arab Sheikhs can well be compared to the local influence of some grandees and magnates who enjoyed like influence up to a few years ago within peraia# l^ie Sheikh of Bahrein is exactly like the nheikh of ifohaaimerah who from his mere position was not qualified to conclude treaties with any foreign power. The Persian Treasury la in possession of irrefutable documentary oridence of taxes paid from very remote times to Persia by these fheikhs, flie fact being admitted that Bahrein has formed part of the Persian Kingdom either for one century according to the British Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs or from time immemorial - save for intervals of abortive revolt at the instigation of forei^c powers - according to Persia's claim, a principle of International law comes inevitably into one^ mind by whioh 2- Any territory belonging to m independent Ocvemment cannot on principle be alienated from that Power as long as the right of ownership is not relinqulahed by the latter in virtue of a treaty with a third party and until the annex ation of the disputed territory by another State or its Independence is recognised by the original owner* According to this principle one of the two following alternatives will have to be accepted by those who aspire to the independence of Bahrein either Bfihrein must have ^oyed-3- li? vk enjoyed at soiAe tluie ruJLl iudepeLLcL^ace , a prcsruaptlon which history rejeote at once or it nmet ^e proved that Persia rellnciuished her right of sorereii^nty orer Bahrein in virtue of a treaty# Persian history shows aany instances of local rebellions of Kfcaac or Sheikhs against the Central Oovemment - rebellions which have always been definitely jmt down - but does a local rebellion sanction the process by which a forei/m power can enter Into treaty with such rebel chieftains ? Moreover according to international law no Crovernment can be asked, while in a state of peace, tc £ive up its right of govemmont over a part of its territory solely and simply on the grounds of difference in language, cnctoiac or race or of separation froa the Mother country by sea# These facts can least of all be denied by Creat Britain# act from the ^hafu^h-i- :urk &gt;i ho* 1590# The T^ditor comments again on Bahrein in the leading article. Che Editor asks whether Bahrein is olaiaed to be an independent state or a colony of jigland# If it is independent, why does the British Oovernaeat intervene in a dispute between Persia and B^xrein and why does the British Consul-General in the Gulf interfere in the appointment or supersession of the local Hheikhs or why do the British authorities Interfere in all the educational, inunicipal and police concerns of the islands ? The policy adopted by the British Oovemiaent In the Gulf in regard to theeti! Sheikhs is ridiculous and cosiiofel beyond comparison* Comrat roial relations tsre first created with the Sheikhs; the brothers or the sons of the old Sheikh are then instigated against their ruling kinsman with the result thatin \ .4. th« latter la rmllad under oover of bombardiseiit from British warships and the aspiring young brother or son Is appointed to sueceed the degraded Bhelkh ; no reward Is then asked for all these benevolent services bat even some thing more Is given as a donation; the new sheikh Is gaaran- teed against farel^i attacks and a treaty Is concluded to safeguard this advanta,?®. The continual Interference of the British resident or Khan Bahadur commenoes fro a that date and if my resistance Is shown the British Dreadnoughts reappear and rosy hopes of supremacy are roused in the mind of a rival sheikh who will succeed the resisting sheikh hen and If need arises. 'axe British Oovernment thus rules Inexpensively all over the Persian Oulf and then fills the World's press with presuRmtuous claims of adranolng the cause of civilisation and justice In the midst of fanatle and ignorant races t of uuttln^ up naval buoys snd lighthouses near their marts and of prohibiting the slave trade In their territories* A negro Is said to have onee tried to silence the weeping of a child In his bosom all the time repeating that he had nothing to fear so long as he was In the arras of himself (the negro)* But the child retorted saying that the fears he had were of the negro himself and not of anyone else, fhe British {Jovemment is now plying with the /Tab Sheikhs exactly as did the negro with the child* The story of Dubai and the appearance at the harbour of British £ufc- boats, cited In the ^ihafa^i sometime ago is an example of this deceitful policy* The putting up of a few buoys by the British &amp;avy in the Gulf is less for philanthropic consider ations than for the furtherance of British commerce which absorbs the root and tmrvovt of the Gtalf 1 s resources. The Indian and British Governments therefore become dissatisfied if any other foreign Power 1 • Ter to us. th. M|AO same roads to Its oira TH« presdnoe of Brltlah gun-lioat# in the (Julf also is for the purpose of intimidating the recalcitrant Sheikhs, who ©imply moan under the tyranny of British offleial8 t and not for the pacification of the Gulf which already envoys complete peace and safety. Tb« British Government can better convince the people of the ast of its humane and philarithropic feelings hy leaving the people of the tfulf coasts to look after their own affairs. The British -fcVess and Public are misguided by the vain boasts of the British Foreign Office of having put down the slave traffic in the Oulf# Slavery is non-existent on the Persian coast simply and purely because of Persia's strong determin ation to punish the slave-traders# The v II a practice is in full swing on the coasts that are under the direct influence and protection of the British Oovernment and the frequent escape to Persian territory of slaves from Oman, Dubai, Sharjeh, and other redone prove this fact beyond doubt* One may wonder why the British flovemment does not put down slavery on the res tern coast with all the paramount supremacy enjoyed and enforced by them thiou^h their ships and gunboats* I'he British OovemmenVs policy in the fJulf has nothing to &lt;5o with humanity or civilisation and these are merely empty words used to deceive public opinion in urope* me one ideal of Great Britain in the lulf is to continually spread her influence, to monopolise the trade of the Oulf and to deprive the inhabitants of all connections with the outer world and British officials shrink from no step, no matter how vile or incompatible with ci ^ilisntion and huatnity it may be, provided tlu t it serves to attain that end* Bshreln is exactly in a slaailar position vis a vis Qreat Britain* The Bahreinis ape loud in their outcry against)ai 1^1 -6- against British ral..

UO. 3333. t B $1 si *X't. : . 15 ft uv^-: rhe editorial again deals with the Bahrein question. rhe Sdltor proceeds with the bo -called second part of the note of the principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to the effect that Persia^ pretentions oyer Bahrein hcve t according Xx&gt; the contention of the Persian Oovemment, been recognised as valid on several occasions by the British Oover anent ; that this contention does not seem to he accurate and that If it were to be found justified. It would appear that It cannot be proved by any other evidence. fhe version given by the paper of the note concludes then that His Majesty^ Goveruajent feel It incumbent on them to declare onee for all that these attteiaenta of the Persian Government are totslly inadmissible. fce Editor finds this part of the Secretary's state- raents strmge and incoherent. He says that if according to the first supposition, the rights of the Persian Oovemment over Bahrein have been recognised by the British Oovemment, what else remains for that Oovernment but to aoquiesce in those rights. ¥hen the claimant of a right admits himself the alienation of that right, what else remains for him in the way of proving that right for himself ? such statements from a British Secretary, who keeps steadfast to the rules of logic In his daily conversation, reminds one of the language used nowadays by Borae of the Husslan Bolshevik Institutions. The latter state that their money f C^eronta, has been officially rated as equivalent to Krsns 64 but when we tell them to accept this same money at the official rate, they refase the request and ask their dues either in Kran or in other forel^ currency. Jhe Russians say that their whole trade with Persia is under the monopoly of the State but when we propose to deal with12.3 -2- with theia on a reoiprooal boeiB and ask them to deal with ub on the same prinolples # they ape Yexod and aay that these state* ments seem to emanate from pro-British souroes* Can one really not draw an exaot parallel between the abore incompatibilities and those of the British Secretary of State who says that the supremacy of Persia over Bshrein has never been reoosnised by the British Ooverament and it would be inadmissible if it were ever recognised ? Lord Clarendon's statements in the course of a note dated April £9th 1869 to the Persian Legation in London, which had produced evidence in support of Persia's claim - a note v «hich had been sent in collaboration with the Secretary of State for India - tend to prove the contrary, that is to say that the British Government far from denying Persian supremacy over ^ mi re in recognised it in those days* Lord Clarendon said that 'Her majesty's Oovernment readily admit that the Govern ment of the Shah have protested against the fact that Her ajesty's officials have paid no attention to the Sovereign rights of Persia over Bahrein saad Ker Majesty's Government h«ve taken due no ice of this protests fhe Secretary of State then proceeds to cite the reasons for the interference of the British Government in the affairs of Bahrein as being the intention to put down piracy and slavery and to establish peaee In the (Silf, ere It not for the aovereignty of Persia oyer Bahrein, what interest had the British Secretary of Stat* in giving Persia the reasons for the interfersnoe of the British aovernment with the affairs of Bahrein. Lord Claren don say a ; 'I oan assure you that Her Ifajesty's OoYerment are only inducing the sheikh of Bshrein to fulfill these obligations with a Tiew to stopping piracy wad slarery end telilf IV the eatabllehiaent of eoourity in the ijulf It 1 b easily understood that up to the year X869 the British GoYemment never apoke of ht vlng any right over Bahrein or of Bahrein being independent. Another p&amp;Bfia^e of the sold note tends to prove raore explicitly the suprem acy of Persia over Bahrein, namely ; 'If the Persian Government Is prepared to maintain sufficient forces in the Gulf so as to ensure the above objects (already explained in the fore^ing lines), this country will be spared a troublesorae and expensive taak. But if the shah la not prepared to take upon himself the discharge of these duties, vi ajesty^ vv:rnm^ni c annot .^cHceiv^ly i:T .iu ( :ine i ».et the Imperial Government wish to encourage outragea and disorder in those waters by lack of necessary punishment M # This passage proves that If the imperial Grovernment shows its readiness to take up the duty of maintaining a police force in the Gulf, the British Government will be spared a vexatious and expensive task ^hlch has induced them to interfere with the affairs of Bahrein. Lord Clarendon further proceeds in that s me note as follows :• Tr I have the honour to state that Her Majesty 1 s Govern- raentyvlll previously Inform the imperial Government of any action which at any moment may be necessary for subduing the Bheikh, should ills behaviour necessitate such action''. This passage shows that the British oovermaent considered it its own duty to inform the real owner of th^ islands of the clrcumotances when necessary, a duty which would obviously be unnecessary if the British Government harbour ed any heslvatlon aa to Persia 's soverei^ity over Bahrein. Over and above all that has been said in these articleE thereLafagh-l -Uorlcfa t9th. 19ao Ihe leading artlole deals again with the », liah .irese oommentB on Bahrein. It eajrs that the Persian aoyorment ■roteated against the mention of the name of Bahrein in the jeddah Treaty of 1927 «nd sent a copy of Its protest to the League of Hationa. The English papers then started a campaign of hubbub over this question the object of which was to under mine the eTldenoe baoked by hiatorle aocumants pro cefi by Persia. This paper wrote a series of articles at the time - In 1306 - In Ko. 910, dealing with the rexiresentations of the Weekly Times and in Hes. 9S6, 927 and 929 answering the state- taents published in the Hear Kast. V /e (the witer) proved by historle evidence that from before the invasion of Persia by islam up to this date - with the exception of the period of reign of the Amavide end some part of the reign ol the .bbasid Caliphs, Bahrein haa been under the aeknewltdged supreeaaoy o Persia find the periods of feudality even did not sever the authority of Persia over the islands. We ima-^inea that xi tnuse valid proofs wuld not altogether silence the official quarters in London, they would at least serve to silence the joititferous and unprinoipled outcry of the nglish press. v ith the pro test of the Persian Oovemment against the grant of oil con cession to a British firm hy the Sheikh of Bahrein the saae old campaign unsupported as in the previous case, by any cogent or tangible evidence, has started again. It would seem inoecorous if we were to repeat here once more the saae historic arguments but since the nglish press have first indulgod in this same practice by repeating their forraer inconsistent statementSf ^e Must here make some mention of our former ooiaments : The ancient geographers defined Bahrein as the land ^mited121 limited on the north by Basrah, on the Baat or ronth East by Oman m&amp; on the West by 'Dehna' (the saafiy desert between fiejd and the Oalf)• This territory together with the island of Bahrein then called '^•al w vnd the Omtm littoral formed integral parts of Persia during the centuries preceding the invasion of Persia by the Arabs; the population of this whole territory # quite unlike that of Arabia which was atheist, was composed of a majority of zoroastrians and of a minority of Christians find Jeivs* A Governor was always nominated by the Persian Govern ment for the territory ana this arrangement was continued till the sixth year after the Hegira v*ie4 Mohamed the prophet sent i,la-bin~el-Khaari to occupy it. The Persian Governor was then Sibalcht who embraced Islam (vide the hi^Mry written by pabari- 'arikh-i-Tabari; MuaJam-ul-Buldan 1 s chapter about Bahrein and mluk-ul-Arab of Reihani, page 208). v *hen Persia regained her independence under the Deylamides, this region also followed the lead of Persia and was under Persian rale and on the decline of the ]&gt;eylamide8 t the tribs Banu-Kayser of the island Q.ai«# ruled over Bahrein as over the entire Gulf # Larestan and a portion of the merman pro vince. Yakut Kf^mavi describes the rulers of Qais in his \ia4im-ul-Buld?in as being of Persian origin and exactly like the Deylamides and adds that two thirds of the revenues of Bahrein are being received by them. When Abu Bekr-bin-Saad-zangi over threw the Qais rulers of Bani Kayser in 627, he took possession of Qais and Bahrein, Hasa and the Oman littoral. After the decline of the Zun&amp;L dynasty, the gxKgjbdai Jengizis and the Teymouris took possession of Bahrein. Bahrein subsequently became a de endenoy of the Kings of ormas who ruled over the inland of Orimis and acknowledged the sovereign rights of Persia. ..hen the c'ortugeae inTaded ths Oulf, the Ortnua rulers were Btlll nominally the imlers of Bahrein and Kukn-ed-Din Hasud t .e » hroth er(a? n^ -2- brother of Efenpaf-ed-Mn Lutfulluh Uo was the vaalr of oriaas was still the Governor of Batirein.

During the misfortunes of the Safavis, Sheikh J abb ar eh Houli the headman of Taheri and its dependenc ies composed of 3&gt;eir and Assali etoetera, annexed Bshrein to his fief and paid its taxes together with the t^xes due for the other regions under his fief, tihaamad Tagbl Khan the Governor General of Bhiraa conquered Bahrein during the reign of Hader Shah but the ruler of rusoat recaptured the place one year later. Hader Hhah then sent an expedition against the Sheikh of usoat, occupied Kusoat end slew the ruler wh4 was then rmfid ben :mltan, The Jfader expeditionary foroe brought under Persian rule all the southern littoral of the flulf but in appreciation of the services that Sheikh flhais and Sheikh iSasr-al-^adkur, the then Governor of Budiire, had rendered to him, islader Shah entrusted them with the Government of Bahrein which then became a dependency of the province of Bushire till the reign of All Mardsn Khan ^nd. he subsequent histoid of Bahrein follows the feuds and disorders prevalent then in Persia and d ring this time that every chieftain arrogated to himself the authority so far acknowledged for the Central Government the tribe Bani tftaiba the ancestors of the present xaaitajnumaadt Sheikh of Bahrein aucceeded in overthrowing the Al ^adkur Sheikhs. When the Central Government as again created in Persia, the present Sheikhs of Bahrein began to profeno a«ala their alleglanoe to Persia )lm and this fact ia fully on record by the letter from Abdullali ben Ahaad towards the year 1250 A .H. and tne letter sent with an emissary by ITtthsusssA ben Khalifeh towards 1^84 or l ^SS* ^¥ere it not for the obstruotive attitude shown by the British Government by coercing the pro-peralan eleraents in Bahrein the Bahreinis would not hove seceded to this date from Persia. But as already explained, the British officials definitely preventad all relations with Persia superseding those who showed a tendency to oppo^iuion by their rivals, or coercing the opponents ana the ^ : aspired to preserve their alle^anoe to Persia by aepoi 'tatio or imprisonment# The ex^julsion of Al Abdullah, the appre hension of uhammed ben Khalifah, :iuhuiamed oen Abdullah nd idi ben Tajer end the obstruotion shown in the way of the despatch of Persian troops to the rescue of lihaamed ben Khalifah are some instances of the exercise o this so .-.reive policy by Great Britain* Phe only argument set forth by the British govomment i,^ that after the rise to power of the Bani TJtaiba Sheikha, Persia lost all control over Bahrein but this is to# bein^ the fact by virtue of the following documents aad incidents: i #etter from Abdullah ben ;\hmad to Prino# Hassan Ali ?&gt;Iir8;a; Petition of Hofcaamtd ben Lhalifeh to gasser-ed- Din Shah and the arrival at the letter's court of jmharamed's emissary; and last but not least the acknowlelement of the Ministry for Forei^i Affairs of rn^land in 1869 of J ersia 's supremacy over Bahrein* Bani TJtaiba caiae into power over Bahrein in 1197 A.H* and the above evidence is all of subs equent date and the British Foreign Office has D^sknowled^ed Persian rule in Bahrein nearly eighty seven years after the ascendancy toj/i power of the present cheikhs of Banrein# The allegiajice to Persia of the proeent 'Theikhs ia therefore beyond i[ totyMA tiw siiadow of tx doabt in of tlie xaat that if it not 80 it r .ould liot hav# legally weakened Persia 1 a poaltion In reg£&lt;rd to ixer clalmfi. !aae abaenoe of a Persian Igapriaon in Bahrein can better be explulzi&amp;d by a sufiiffiury study of Persian xiiitory for the last 100 or lo yetrs .hioh would prove that the ^yatem of oorernfflent totally eliiain- iited the neceaaity of aending special garrisons to any port, or ro^iona vihifth were wmally ruled by iooal 'Kalanatars who frequently took advantage of the temporary weakness of the Central Govenunent to stop the peyaent of their yearly tri&gt;mte for an interval more or less short. But this temporary overthrow of the yoke of obedience in no way has weakened the Persian ceuoe in any way. As an examule we a&amp;y mention Lurestaa ^hich until very recently was titally out off from any bond of tiubservienee to the central Govern ment and which now forma an integral and peaceful provincs of Persia. m13 8 raaslatlon* auuiwilftr a i ^ JS4Jg&amp;. oont oT«rBy f th« writer who now signs hiaa«lf as .vhmad Fararaarzi, states that th&lt; absence of a Persian garrison in ^slirein, besides the example of lAirestan torrjierl^ giYen, oan also be aooounted for by the oate^orieal refusal of Great Britain to allow the passage to Bahrein of Persian forces. BJTerybody aay hare heard of the story of Persia' u efforts in 1^85 A.H. i.e. some 6k years ago to send troops to the rescue of .^uhaamed ben Khalifeh, the then S eikh of Bahrein* The troops were delayed on the sea by British gunboats and the sheikh was in the meantime deported to India for his arrogant attempt at appeal to his CfCrernraent. Had it not been for the iron will of the 3hah t Hengroa would have proved to be a second Bahrein when the Persian OOTernment lately decided to station a garrison there and the British Govemment raised the usual hundred a id one objections* Is really the absence of a garrison and the conclusion of a treaty between the Sheikh of Bahrein and the Indian Government a valid proof for the independence of Bahrein ? fhm what would Great Britain say, if the -us si an (Government or the Afghans were to sign treaties, without the British ^/Overnment , s ngu consent or knowledge, with the sersl*Independent border states of India vdiich so far have not paid taxes to the Central Govermaent and where Great Britain has not yet sent a garri son ? if such is the verdict of International Law, why then did the British Ooverment induce with such insistence Turkey to relinquish all rights of sovereignty over Kgypt, Malta and Cyprus in the conventions si.^ned after the Groat T^ar although l^urkoy's rule over these countries had lapsed for more than 100 years in some instances ? -nother ridiculous contention of the British papers is that Bahrein is nearer to the Arabian coast than to Persia*13/ tk 0 -2- n-iis la more thm ridiculous, one mqr lifcawlse ask why do the islands close to the shores of Anatolia belong to Italy instead of to Turkejr or the dominions of (Treat Britain to the British Islands instead of to the natire races ? 1*he question of ruoe is of no proper relue in the present age. Bo country now can boast of purity of raee or of unity of races wider its Oorerm&amp;ent. Take for instance the Balkan States» Austria, Germany, Belgium and Switzerland; none of them ic free from the amalgamation of diverse races* JOreover most regions of Creman preponderance under present arrangements come under the Italian Crovernment which is a Latin state or of C zee ho Slovakia which is a &amp;la State* Why is it that the nuaane and philanthropic Government of Great Britain does not pay the subtest attention to the outcry of the Indians and Palestinians against their oppressive rule and to the difference in raee, creed, customs and all other pooullarities between the victoms and the rulers ? Such assertions as those that we see in the ^glish papers sound indeed still more strange when one comes to ponder for a minute or two over the projects of the British Government in Palestine where d0O 9 O0O Arabs are doomed to be trarapled upon by being subjected to the rule and privileges of the Jews in utter minority now swelled to 120 ,000 after all the efforts by v^iich Jewish emigrants have been attracted from Russia, Eeumanla, Poland and America* As for affinity of raee we ask the British papers to say whether Egypt and Pal estine are nearer to Arabia and yria respectively or to England. We ask why do the pretentions of the Jews over Palestine after thousands of years still hold ^ood when the uii quest ion able rights of Persli; over Bahrein fade awsy in the opinion of British papers after a few yeur's non-intervention13^ -3- and negligence. Jhe reason *riiy the inhabitants of B&amp;hrein and some other parts of Persia speeJc Arabic is the prlnoi pie of 'total denial of race distinction aiaong all iiosle» nations'. Islam being by far the most powerful unifying factor, all people who chose to take residence in my of the lalaaic countries become the eitisiiena and subjects of that country without distinction of race. It was in accordance with this principle that Persia welcomed with brotherly love and Moslem raa^naaimlty all refugee frora the Arabs who were driven away from Arebistan as a result of their local feuds; this fact is further illustrated by the preeence of Arab elements among the populations in places like Khorasan, Fers ? nd other parts of Persia. Persians welcomed the influx of Arab immigrants to Bahrein little foreseeing the present situation when a foreigner comes to claim protection over Bahrein even against the winh of all parties concerned.A. \ IM A copy of the undermentioned papers is forv^arded to the non*ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf for information, in continuation of the endorsement from the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department No. F.366-N/29, dated the 12th July 19 30. 2.

Translation) Sir, According to a statement which has appeared in several newspapers, more particularly the ^Near East and India' and the 'Baghdad Tines' of June 5th and 10th last, a British Syndicate has obtained from the Sheik±i of Baiirein a concession for exploiting the oil in the island, and Major Eolmes, the representative of the Syndicate, has already 'begun work. In view of the fact that the Bahrein Islands form an integral part of Persia and that Persia possesses^ incontestable rights of sovereignty over those islands - as proved to your Government and to the League of Nations in our letters of November 26th, 19E7 and August End, 1926, referring to the express recognition by your Government in 1069 of Persia 7 s rights of sovereignty over the islands - my GrOvernment protests energetically against uhe concession in question and against any other concession not granted directly by the Persian Government in the Bahrein Islands, and declares such concessions null and void. I regret that, despite the spirit of equity which I readily acknowledge in your Government, it should from time to time become necessary to renew our protests on this matter. Such acts - and the failure to recognise Persia's incontestable rights over the Bahrein Islands - cannot, of course, in any way affect those rights, and my Government considers itself at liberty to claim and demand the restitution of any profits that may accrue from the con cession in question, without prejudice to the damages relating thereto.

Another possible counter-lolast would seem to be to inform the Persians that, as they have abolished capitulations in Persia, Persian subjects in Bahrain will no longer enjoy the benefit of a capitulatory regime and will in future be tried by Bahrain courts. I do not see how the Persians can possibly object to this since they deny our position in Bahrain and they can hardly claim that their subjects in Bahrain should be sub- ] ject to British jurisdiction instead of Bahrain jurisdiction, and the Persian colony in Bahrain is both numerous and wealthy J and would, I am sure, strongly object to the abolition of their^ present privileged position, under which they are only subject to the jurisdiction of the Political Agent's court and not to that of the Bahrain court.A* /l/fsv) 19/191. /r? \kt Extract from Personal letter dated 27th September 1930 to E.B.Howell ^sq.,C.S.1.,C.I.E.,Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, Simla. Another possible counter-blast would seem to be to inform the Persians that their large and wealthy colony in Bahrain will no longer enjoy a capitulatory regime and will in future be subject to the Jurisdiction of the Bahrain courts. I do not see how they can object to this; firstly, they refuse to recognise that we have any rights in Bahrain and in the second place they have abolished the capitulations in their own country, and as we have Just definitely written to the Persians informing them that we refuse to recognise their clai to Bahrain the objections which previously existed to this course have lost a good deal of their force, tfe would there fore seem to have some trump cards still left. I am not in a position to judge whether it is feasible or desirable to play them, but I am merely exploring possibilities. 1 do however feel that unless we are prepared to take some action the Persians are not likely to give way over the mail question and while I did not attach much importance to the other pinpricks that Glivq suggested the Persians might inflict upon the Resident, I have all along said that the question of the aail bags was very important and also the question of passports. * * * * * *I If?

One who does not know Bahrain will truly bel^jlve that Shaikh Hamad bin f Isa, Shaikh of Bahrain, is the person who grants the concession and does things which suits him. 'The fact is that the Shaikh of Bahrain cannot do anything, not even can visit his father, v /itnout asiiin^, the advice of the British. The rule in Bahrain is in the hands of the British. The British Adviser is the person who rules Bahrain and levy taxes. He collects the revenues and the Customs duty of the Country• he orders and he executes, but the Shaikh puts his honoured signature on all papers which the British Adviser submits to him f with out giving any opinion of his own.

The Shaikh visits the Government Office* 4 for half an hour every fortnight. From this it will anpear that the Con cession which the British Oil Company obtained in Bahrain was granted by the British and not by the Shaikh, and the Adviser is the person who entered into agreement with the Company. The Shaikh had signed the deed of AgrBeinent withoi kn wing what was written and may ^lavp^not even read the terms of the concession.

THE DISPUTE BETWEEN ENGLAND AND PERSIA FOR THE P EI-tSIAK GULF. There is a reat quarrel between England and Persia, the contnetion of which is the Persian Gulf. England took advantage of the opportunity which was destined to her during the last hundered years and spread her influence on the islands and shores of the Sulf by making treaties with the local chiefs on the basis of seli governing, but Persia, lately rafcsed from her long sleep and was successful,under her present monarch, to put an end to these princedoms, which were established by the British policy, and were(princedoms) brought under Persiax control by the same methods mentioned previously. There was tension between the London and Tehran Governments and it became very serious after the Persian Governments refusal to allow the establishMnt of the British air line which passes through Persia to India. The readers remember the tumult which was made by the British news-papers in this connection, and how in turn England refused to allow the Persian-German airships to fly on Tehran-Baghdad line and how she(England) turns to the promisees sometimes and to the manaces another till at last she succeeded in having the question adjusted exactly Persia was not satisfied with regaining her power in her Western shores and she tried to extend this power on some of Persian Gulf islands, especially on Bahrain which she claimed to be a completing part of her country. She was taking the advantage of every opportunit which is suitable for her demanding this right which she c claimsd that iiigland has usurped. We learnt by today's cables that she has forwarc -ed a letter to the League of Nations protesting against the concession which the British Petroeum Compaay has obtained from the Shaikh of Bahrain to exploit oil in BahraL n Islands. She had previously protested when the Anglo-Najd Treaty, which was is called Jiddah Treaty, was signed, in which King Bin Sa'ud promissed not to attack the princedoff which are under the British protection, including Bahrain. We do not know whether her protest will have some effects as her previous one or if the League of Natic will lay aside and pay no attention to it, but we know thc- her claim is absolutely baseless for Bahrain is a pure Arab State which became under Peis ian control for a short time and then they(Persian) lost it since a long time. If we deny the Persians their rights in Bahrain islands it does not mean that Bahrain should be under British control for the population of these islands are pure Arabs as we said before and the National theories have occupied their minds perfectly in the last years and it became thoir sole intention to get to get rid of British control and to join one of the two neighbouring Arabic kingdoms of Najd and ♦Iraq. But they could do nothing as their opinions are hardly pressed and they have no note in what England does whether from the economical or political point of views. There is no doubt that their unwillingness for being brought back under the Persian control will not equlize, but to their remaining, as they are now, under th British protection.The British policy became more vigorous in the fiersian Gulf since she collected that her air communicatior with India, through Persia, is not safe from ct^cumstaaceB Therefore she determind to find a ne ^r quarter for her out side the Persian countries. We learnt that she succeeded in this by making an agreement with King Bin Sa^d that he would establish a quarter for aeroplanes (airdrome) in Darii Island which will be equipped and supervised by English aviators and its object is to train the Najdis, We also learnt that she(i2ngland) intends to transfer the quarter ol her Political Resident from Abadan to one of Bahrain islanc or to Darin itself. If this is true the ilnglish Government has gained new success in her Arabic policy by her facilitating the way to bring Darin Island, which lies at the gates of Qatil and which the nature has made into one of the great easterr harbours, under her control and by transferring her Politic Resident in Persian Gulf iVom a Persian country which can not be relied to an Arab country which there is no fear ol her at present. But we are still in doubt as to the sound ness of these views which we obtained about the British aerodromes which were established in an islands which is € part of Najd. Our doubt is due to the abstruseness of the views first and secondly to our beleif in the cleverness ol King Bin Sa'ud and his persistence on the independency and security of his country and his wide experience as to the British policy and her manoeuvres(in policy).0 No. 221. British legation, Tehran, 22nd October, 1930. His Britannic Majesty's Representative presents his compliments to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India and has the honour to transmit herewith copy of the document mentioned in the sub-Joined Schedule, on the subject ^f;- Bahrein. Reference;- Article in the Tehran newspaper '• Shafagh-i-Sorkh' of 8th October, 1930.@ Translation of an extract from the Shafagh^i-Sorkh No. 1608 dated 8th October, 1930. The continuation of the letter from an Arab well-informed of Bahrein affairs under the heading ''hat is the present situation at Bahrein', goes on as follows;- Englishmen began to frequent the island about a hundred years ago. The Arabs were then in supremacy as they had raised the islands only shortly before and they treated the Persians harshly, and used to exact tribute from them. The English soon became aware that the majority of the population was formed by the Persians who exerted a moral influence over the islands and they therefore assumed the self-imposed task ol suppoiting the interests of the Persians whom they ostensibly claimed to protect on behalf of the Persian Government. They pretended to help the Persian elements and thus secured a pretext lor interfering with local affairs but in secret they helped the Arab rulers with whom they iaait close relations. The two ignorant opponents were thus hoodwinked to their total disadvantage for the advancement of British interests. The Director of the ^municipality who was a Persian until a few years ago and who commanded strong influence owing to the enthusiastic support that he received from the Persian population and the Officer commanding the forces(Internal Police) who was also a Persian were both compelled to reti-e like all other Persians who were in office as a result ol the machinations and intrigues of the British. The latter created discord between the Consul of Ibn Saud the King oi the Hedjaz and the Persians which culminated in the attack by the followers of Ibn Saud on the Persians in Bahrein. This incident is a long jLUxa which will be told if 1 ound necessary. Ihe ^ power;57 /K power of the British was enormously increased in consequence of this event. fall of Sheikh Issa. Former British Consuls up to the time of Ua.1 or Daly about five years ago did not interfere official ly in the affairs of Bahrein. As aoon as ^a.1 or Daly arrived, he 'began to sow the seeds of dissention and enmity 'between Shiahs and Sunnis, the Bahreinis and the Arabs. He wore a long beard and passed himself off as a Mussulman and strictly observed muslim rites. He used to pay nocturnal visits to Mosques and other sacred places wearing Arab robes. He soon began to play the same role towards the A1 Khalifeh family, composed of the . numerous brothers and cousins of the ruling Sheiidi like Sheikh ^uhamed. Sheikh Abdullah, Sheikh Ali and others who owned large properties around Bahrein and each of whom enjoyed more or less independent supremacy over their regions but acknowledged the overloraship of their ruling kinsman. Ill-feeling and discord began to show themselves among the leading members of the family who soon started to wage hostility towards each other. Sheikh Issa was a roundheaded man who did not show a disposition to be obedient to the orders of Uajor Daly. He was therefore surrounded on every side and eventually disabled. The Central Government of Persia was at the time extremely weak and this fact made the Sheikh helpless as he was unable to find any support on which he could reckon. He therefore tenaered his resignation and nominated his son Sheikh Hamed, as the ruler of Bahrein, he himself retiring to Muhraq. Ever since. Sheikh Issa has been the nominal Sheikh of Bahrein but Sheikh Hamed has been the real ruler although he is acting for his father. Sheikh liamed . He is aged about 59; he is a man of very strong physique, optimistic, modes, of simple manner and credulous. While his father was still in power, iiiaj or Daly induced him to go with him to London where he was received in audience by King George and where he was entertained brilliantly. He was taken V toto the military stores of the War Office and to various other British institutions and he 'was filled with awe and admiration of the great power of the British Government. On his return to Bahrein intrigues were set up for the suppression of his father and his nomination to the Sheiididom. Sheikh Hamed was allowed a free hand when he was first brought to power but he was soon won over by the British and placed under their moral influence and he became thus a puppet in the hands of the British agent. Under the guise of adaptation to European life, he was first encouraged to give up the pompous life of the former Sheiiii of Bahrein; he stopped the public entertainment usually given by the rulers to the subordinate Sheikhs and their Arab followers during which several sheep were consumed by day and night. He thus lost all contact with the general public. He was then encouraged to disband his Arab troops and a garrison of 500 Indians was quartered in Kaleh Sheikh nominally for his protection there is another contingent of 250 Indians in the British Consulate. The garrison in Kaleh Sheikh is commanded by Captain Parke who is called the officer commanding the Kaleh Sheikh troops. All the properties of the brothers and cousins of Sheikh Issa^al-Khalifeh were confiscated for the Government and pensions ranging from 2,000 to 10,000 Hupees were given to each of them - Sheikh Issa and Sheikh Hamed receive each a monthly stipend of Rupees ten thousand. Secret Treaties. British Mandate over Bahrein. British Counsellor nominated for the Government of Bahrein . jVhen the above arrangements were completed and the Persian head of the ^nicipality and the Officer Commanding the Police and the troops were dismissed as formerly explained, ^ajor Daly concluded secret agreements with Shei&amp;i Hamed the details of which are not known. But from various data gathered from those close to the Sheikh it is known that by virtue of the same conventions, the British Government has guaranteed to the A1 Khalifeh family the permanent Sheikhdom of Bahrein and the Sheikh has acknowledged the British mandatePimandate(suzerainty?)over Bahrein, After the revolt of the Persians, an individual called Dalrymple Belgrave arrived at Bahrein and opened at office ajj^t from the British Consulate which he called ,, The Office of the Counsellor to the Government of Bahrein' Sheikh Hamed had two seals prepared exactly similar to each other with this insciiption Sheikh Hamed ben Issa al Khalifeh. One of the seals is kept toy him and the other is in the hands of the British Counsellor who uses it for sealing all orders, letters and judgments which are then put into force# All municipal, fiscal, judicial and military concerns of the islands come under the direct supeivision of the British Counsellor# Liaj or Daly did not stop his inteiierence in the affairs of Bahrein even after gaining complete success as mentioned above# He began to interfere in the municipal ana army matters. But a Muslim Baluch who was in the Kaleh Sheikh troops decided to kill Liaj or Daly. On one of the official occasions when Uajor Daly was reviewing the troops, he was fired at but unfortunately the bullet only hit his ear. 'when the Baluch saw that he had missed his victim, he shouted at him and said that if he were given another cartridge he would complete his object. The Officer Commanding the troops ordered that the Baluch should be arrested at once but the latter attacked and wounded Major Daly with his unloaded rifle and he was then arrested. Two days after this incident, a British Gunboat arrived from Bushire and took away Major Daly at the dead of night because they wanted to silence the popular uproar against him in Bahrein. He lived for some time in Africa where he had a brother trading in coffee and it was rumoured that because he had overstepped his duties by interfering too much in the internal aftair^ ol Bahrein, he was dismissed from the service of the British Government. But he was soon appointed as British Consul at oistan where he still is. One should be on guard against this man. When Major Daly was removed. Captain Erior sent orders irom Bushire for the execut ionexecution of the Baluch. After the expulsion of or Dal/, the oppressor, another person called Colonel Barrett was sent to Bahrein# He was apparently very mild and of a 'bland nature 'but his policy was exactly the same as his predecessor and he fostered British designs with the same vigour. He was so sweet mannered and sociable that the people of Bahrein soon forgot the former behaviour of ^ajor Daly. Colonel Barrett at times would further gratify the people of Bahrein by freely reciting and criticising in public the acts of Major Daly. But he did not stay long and was relieved by Captain Prior who is still in Bahrein. His behaviour is exactly like that of i^ajor Daly. Remark. Bahrein is at the present moment under the rule of two British officials: 1. Mr. Belgrave, the Counsellor, who is administering the internal affairs and 2. Captain Prior, who, under the guise of British Consul, deals with the foreign affairs of Bahrein. All matters concerning the islands must need^ pass through the hands of these two officials.Confidential• h ^ V, j r iA m a V •ii ^ I v kjH A Ho.D.4875-N/30• fia t 1 M' \V' V A copy of the undermentioned paper? is forwarded to the Hon* ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, for information, in continuation of the endorsement from the Govern ment of India in the Foreign and Political Department, iIo.5 , .i45-N/ 28, dated the 25th March 1929.

Dear Laithwaite» We are sending you officially a copy of Clive^ despatch No .471 of September 23rd about the Persian claim to Bahrein, and the recent press campaign in the Tehran papers. e The press articles enclosed in Glive^ despatch are evidently officially inspired, and I think you will agree that they indicate the general lines of a very detailed reply to our note of 'U4 February 18th, 1929. We should, I think, take advantage of this disclosure of the Persian line of argument by getting somebody to work at once on the historical arguments adduced. The Shafagh -i-Sorkh of September i9th, for example, goes into the historical aspect of the question in some detail and gives several references to the works of Moslem historians. Do you think that you can arrange to have all this looked into, either in the India Office or by the Governnoent of India, in order that we may be in a position to meet the Persian case if and when they next put it before the League of Nations ? It would be useful, of course, if we could not only criticise the Persian government 1 s authorities, but produce some Moslem authorities of our own# whose works were less favourable to the Persian cause.

Dear Baxter, ■pn Would you please refer to your demi-official letter of 8th October, No. E.5327/1^3/91, on the question of the examination of the historical arguments adduced in support of the Persian claim to Bahrein in the recent Press campaign in the Tehran papers ? As I explained to you, we feel some difficulty in undertaking this task ourselves, and we are very reluctant to press the Government of India on it at the present time, when the Foreign and Political Department are working under great pressure. But, apart from this, it seems to us that at the present moment at any rate, the task is an unnecessary one, and that on general grounds there are even substantial objections to allowing ourselves, if we can at all avoid it, to be drawn into argument with the Persians on the mediaeval history of B^ar^in. The main ground and the real strength of our case is that though Persian rule had admittedly existed for a century and a half before 1783, and apparently intermittently at an earlier period, it definitely came to an end in 1783; that it has never since been restored; and that there is nothing in the alleged international principle that the independence of a country, in order to be valid, must be officially recognised by its former sovereign (compare paragraphs vV*' * 6 and 7 of our note of 18th February, 1929). In the India Office view, it would be inconsistent and weakening to this case if we followed the Persians into a discussion yI/ I ^ discussion of historical details prior to 1783 and, subject to your observations, we are disposed to think that we should continue to base our case essentially on the main ground, and should deal with Persian arguments (based on the early history of Bahrein) as briefly and in as little detail as possible. We should prefer, in these circumstances, at any rate at this stage, to take no further action , and to await developments. He still, of course, hope that as the result of the present negotiations a friendly settlement may be reached about Bahrein. Yours sincerely, Sd/- J. Gr. Laithwaite. C.

It appears hardly open to doubt that these articles ttere officially inspired and their contents can therefore be taken as an indication of the lines of argument likely to be adopted by the Persian Govtrruaent, if, as a result of an eventual breakdown of the treaty negotiations, they decide actively to pursue the dispute regarding their claim to Bahrein. In such an event, it ml^ht be tiiat His Majesty's Government would find it necessary to agree to a reference to arbitration, in which case it would be well that the arguments based on the history of Bahrein prior to 178S should have been thoroughly studied at leisure and count er-arguiti nts prepared. 3.
