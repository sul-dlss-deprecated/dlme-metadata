No. 2. PERSIA, HERAT, AND SEISTAN— (continued). The following further correspondence has passed between the Viceroy of India and the Secretary of State on the above subject:— Telegram from Viceroy, 5th January 1880 “ Secret. Poliowing message from Teheran to Foreign Office repeated liere. Begins. Furrah, though doubtless considered by Persia included in territory to be occupied, might be excluded without disturbing conditions now under consideration, but if range of Siah Koh would also exclude Subzawar districts, I consider present terms might probably have to be modified. Ends. “ It appears essential that Government of India should be well informed regarding limits of pro posed territory assigned to Persia; unless these limits are carefully settled with India there will be confusion and misunderstanding in Afghanistan. “We consider presence of British representative with Persian army of occupation most important.” This telegram was followed by a secret letter, No. 3, dated the 7th of January 1880, from the Government of India, indicating the general lines of future policy which they recommended to be adopted in regard to Afghanistan. This letter referred to Herat and Seistan, &amp;c., in the following language:— * * * * “ 7- In dealing with a disunited Afghanistan, the more difficult problems are presented by the re moter provinces. The value of Herat to India has been long recognized; and hitherto the policy of Her Majesty’s Government has been to keep it in the hands of an independent Afghan State whose interests on that frontier of Afghanistan were con sidered to be identical with our own. But the circumstances which dictated that policy have now entirely changed; the Afghan States which we maintained in possession of Herat have ceased to exist; and it has become necessary to make without delay, upon a different basis, some fresh dispositions for the conservation of our interests in this im portant fortress and province. It is obvious, how ever, that the distance of Herat from India places it beyond the ordinary range of our military operations, and would, therefore, render difficult the exercise of direct political control. The annex ation of Herat to Kabul or Kandahar would neither be popular at Herat, nor provide for the politicalsecurity of a province peculiarly exposed to the intrigues and cupidity of powerful neighbours; while, as a separate State, Herat would be too weak to stand by itself, and might thus be compelled, m default of control from India (which, as we have already said, would be difficult), to look elsewhere for protection and support. For these reasons we concur in the decision which, as we understand, has already commended itself to Her Majesty s Government on grounds of Imperial policy, whereby Persia will be provisionally permitted to occupy Herat, under sufficient guarantees for her good administration of it, and for her adequate protection of British and Indian interests at that point, and with a special reservation of our right to occupy the place with British forces in certain eventu alities* “ 8.* While the terms of this understanding with Persia will, we feel certain, receive fiom Ihi Majesty’s Government an attention proportionate to the magnitude of the question it raises, and the interests it involves, we are more immediately con cerned with those conditions which directly affect our dealings with the rest of Afghanistan. 01 these, one of the most important is the future boundary to be assigned to Herat; and this is^ a point so intimately connected with the territorial and political re-arrangement of the rest of Afghan istan that, if any room is left for misunderstanding or dispute as to the extent ot the territory to be assigned to Persia, much confusion and embarass- ment may ensue. We are not yet in a position to demarcate this boundary, but we conceive that the question is one that should be decided mainly and specially on considerations of Indian interests and policy ; and we are of opinion that Pur rah certainly, and possibly Hash Jowain also should be excluded from the territories placed under Persian control. We are now actively engaged in pushing forward a railway towards Kandahar; and, believing, a&gt; we do, that the opening of such communication affords the surest guarantee not only for the peacelul development of the countries traversed, but for the permanent security of our frontier, we consider that Persia should be bound to contribute sub stantially towards the ultimate extension of this line to Herat. It will be apparent to Her Majesty’s Government that such an extension of our Kandahar railway will be a most effecti\ e means of ensuring the stability of any political arrangement with Persia regarding Herat, and will materially strengthen Persia in fulfilling her engagements. “9. The question of Seistan is nearly connected with that of Herat. The conditions which justified our intervention and arbitration in 1872 no longer apply; and if it is decided to make over Herat to Persia, we are prepared to recommend a revision of the Seistan boundary also in favour of Persia. This, however, is likewise a question on which we are not yet in a position to express a decided opinion;3 though we trust that the decision of it will be practically left to this Government when the general delimitation of the provinces of Afghan istan is considered.” 1 wo days after the date of the above secret letter the Viceroy sent a telegraphic summary of it, of which the following portion referred to Herat, &amp;c.:— Prom Viceroy, 9th January 1880 :— “ Herat being beyond range of our military and political control, we concur in decision to entrust city and territory conditionally to Persia, but we consider necessary and very important, careful settlement of boundaries in concert with India, excluding Purrah and Hash Jowain, and lay stress on Persian contribution to railway. Since Persia takes Herat, no objection to reconsider Seistan arbitration decision, though India should deal with question as belonging to general boundary settle ment. Then followed a further telegram from Vicerov 10th January 1880 :— ^ “ Secret. Teheran Minister requests me to tele- * This draft Convention is not in this graph home observations on draft* Convention Department. “ Observations begin “ In preamble, reference to Gundamuk Treaty appears to weaken not strengthen basis of British action, since treaty, if existent, is intended rather to prevent than admit foreign acquisition of Afghan territory.

I would omit special reference to surplus, which facilitates evasion, and would stipu late in more general terms contribution from Herat revenues.” After this date the following further telegraphic correspondence passed between the Viceroy and the Secretary of State :— Prom Viceroy, 13th January 1879 . * Appointment by Ayub of Governor to Purrah instead of Afzai, fled to Persia, also reported 5 Assuming definite exclusion of Purrah from Persian arrangements, I consider early occupation of Pur rah by Slier Ali very important, as pre-occupation in force from Herat might have prejudicial effect on Kandahar.” Prom Secretary of State, 15th January 1880 Secret and personal.
