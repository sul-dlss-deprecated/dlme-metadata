Aden Defences. (No. 2790.) From Colonel M. W. Willoughby, Secretary to Government of Bombay, Military Department, to Colonel G. Chesney, Secretary to the Govern ment of India, Military Department, Calcutta (No. 6106, dated Bombay Castle, the 30th November 1881). Deferring to Secretary Colonel Allen Johnson’s letter, No. 973 S. C., dated 6th July 1880 (Defences, Forts), and to the correspondence ending with this Government docket, No. 3836, dated 25th July 1881, E am directed to forward herewith, for the consideration of the Defence Committee, copy of a letter from the Quartermaster- General, No. 14-1/3376, dated 11th October 1881, and its accompanying reports and plans, in connection with the Aden defences. 2. I am desired to remark that the redistribution of the armament on the defences of Aden was generally approved, as per Secretary Colonel Burne’s No. 578 S., dated 17th June 1878 (Armaments, Aden). The distribution of eight dismounted 7-inch B.B.L. guns, however, would appear to have been carried out only to the following limited extent,— 2 Ras Tarshyne (2 were already mounted there), 1 lias Morbut, in consequence of orders subsequently received from the Government of India, and quoted in the margin.* Since 1878 five 32-pdr. smooth-bore muzzle-loading guns, which formerly were mounted in the Mole^Battery, Morbut Fort, were returned into the arsenal, as they were no longer required there, the Mole Battery having been converted into an open saluting battery (see this Government docket, No. 104, dated 9th January 1879). # Letter to this Government, Public Works Department, No. 1088 M. W., dated 5th August 1878. Officiating Deputy Secretary Captain T. Deane’s Memorandum, No. 551 8., dated 16th October 1878, para. 2 (Armaments). 3. It will be observed that, without trenching on the recommendations of the Defence Committee for the improvementof the defences of Aden, His Excellency the Commander- in-Chief advocates that provision should be made for the more immediate needs of Aden in armament and improvised defence works, as the final adoption of the proposals of the Defence Committee will entail considerable delay and very heavy expenditure. 4. In this view His Excellency the Governor in Council approves generally of the economical measures proposed in paras. 8 and 9 of the Quartermaster-General’s letter, No. 14-1/3376, dated 11th ultimo, and is pleased also to commend to the Government of India the points noted in paras. 10 and 11 of that letter, as it is most unsatisfactory that works should remain in a state of apparent preparation or half demolition for years. 5. As regards para. 12 of the Quartermaster-General’s letter, No. 14-1/3376, of 11th October last, I am to transmit extracts paras. 11, 20, and 21 of that Officer’s No. 1-5/1749, of 29th June 1881, and to state that the subject of the removal of the arsenal at Aden from its present position at the isthmus was referred to in the Public Works Department in connection with the question of providing increased barrack accommodation at Aden. His Excellency in Council concurred in the view of the Comnknder-in-Chief as then expressed, that the removal of the arsenal to where the Peninsular and Oriental condensing yard is situated is not desirable. 6. A copy of Government Resolution, No. 6016, of to-day’s date, accompanies. 7193. I. 1818. A2 Extracts paras. 11, 20, and 21 of Quartermaster-Q-eneraTs Letter, No. 1-5/1749, dated 2^th June 1881. 11. Lieutenant Clarke also submits that it would be advisable to remove the arsenal from its present position at the isthmus to where the Peninsular and Oriental condensing yard is now situated, for the following reasons :— “ 1. The arsenal is situated at a great distance from the batteries at Steamer Point, and conveying ammunition from the landing place to the arsenal, and back to the batteries at Steamer Point, will be difficult and expensive when the heavy guns are mounted. “ 2. The present arsenal is open to assault and to curved fire from ships.” 20. As regards the removal of the arsenal and commissariat stores, His Excellency considers that Lieutenant Clarke’s proposals will have to be referred to the Defence Committee and the Commissary-General. 21. He opines that the establishment of a new arsenal close to the most important battery at Aden is not to be commended, nor would it, he thinks, be judicious to have the valuable commissariat stores so close to the seashore. However inconvenient and expensive it may be to have this depot in the camp, there and nowhere else should it be placed. Defences and Fortifications, Aden, Reports. Military Department, No. 6106. Bombay Castle, 30th November 1881. Letter from the Quartermaster-General of the Army, No. 14-1/3376, dated 11th October 1881:— “ I have the honour, by direction of His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief, to forward herewith the reports on the Aden defences prepared in accordance with Government Resolution, No. 3560, dated 16th July 1880. “ 2. The matter being a most important one, it has been deemed necessary to have copies made of the plans for future reference, hence the delay in submitting the papers. “ 3. In forwarding on Major General Loch’s report, His Excellency deems it neces sary to add a few observations. “ 4. Aden may, with Malta and Gibraltar, be considered as one of the ganglions on our line of communication with England. Not only does it serve the purpose of a port of shelter for shipping, but, as the only coaling station between Suez and Bombay, it acts as a reserve of offence, wherewith to protect our interest floating on the Indian Ocean and the Red Sea. Its economical protection becomes then a question of great and immediate importance, for, in the words of General Collinson, R.E., a coaling station left undefended is not only a loss to your own vessels, but a gain to the enemy. “ 5. A Defence Committee having already presented to Government their recom mendations for the improvement of the defences of Aden, General Hardinge will not trench on the particular subjects so ably discussed by them. He contents himself now with pointing out that, if carried out in their entirety, they will involve a very heavy expenditure and take a long time to complete ; also that some 2,000 men at least would be required to man the guns and defences. “ 6. Meanwhile the defences will remain in an insecure state, and he thinks it is well to consider whether some economical means might not be adopted to place Aden in a state of security against a coup-de-main. “ 7. These means are, first guns and ammunition, and secondly, defences, proper. Without the former no defence is possible; the latter can always be improvised. I l h 11“ In making this remark, he would pointedly beg to request the attention of Government to the report by General Loch on the state of the armament. For the defence of the harbour there are eight 9-inch M.L.R., six 7-inch B.L.R., four 8-inch S.B., five 32-pounders, It would be easy to carry out at once the greater part of the recommendations of the Defence Committee by substituting for these,— Three 18-ton, Two 61-pounder, Six 12-ton, Four 25-pounder, Two 80-pounder, leaving the 38-ton guns and three more 12-ton guns to he provided when the Ras Tarshyne, Ras Morhut batteries, and the Moncrieff pits on Flint Island shall have been completed. “ The guns as per above list are either at Aden or available in India, and nothing prevents this provision being made. On this point, the Commander-in-Chief solicits the early orders of Government, as also for the commencement of some improvised defences on Flint Island, pending the Moncrieff pits being taken in hand. “ 9. What those improvised defences should he he will leave for the consideration of officers of the Royal Engineers and Royal Artillery. He contents himself with pointing out that, along the coast of France, and at even such an important place as Wilhelmshafen, the defences are entrusted to open earth batteries with rough blindages for traverses, magazines, &amp;c. It is not necessary to contemplate the possibility of a small gunboat, carrying a 38-ton gun, creeping along the opposite shore of the harbour of Aden and assaulting the inner harbour. Mr. Reed has, on this point, well remarked that ‘ when people talk of sending very large guns to sea for ocean purposes, * in very fast and very small ships, they dream, because you cannot get a very small 1 seagoing ship to go very fast even without a big gun, and with it it is an absolute ‘ impossibility.’ The improvised defences should therefore simply contemplate an assault from a 64-pdr. or 7-inch gun at most. “ 10. The recommendation to scarp Ras Tarshyne fort is worthy of consideration, though doubtless wire entanglements round the fort and a Gatling gun would prove a still better protection, and could be provided at a much less expense. “ 11. The simplification of the armament at the isthmus position can also be carried out without much expense to Government, and the Seera Island defences proceeded with as funds become available. ce 12. The question raised regarding the arsenal has already been referred to Govern ment in this Office Letter, No. 1-5/1749, dated 29th June 1881. His Excellency does not now see reason to change the opinion therein expressed. “ 13. He has likewise not considered it advisable to direct the assembly of the Com mittee recommended by General Loch. Leaving aside that the mixed constitution of it, as proposed by him, is opposed to the regulations, he thinks that any such proposals should first he submitted to the Defence Committee. “ 14. The question of lubricants, covers for the rifled guns, &amp;c., have been referred for consideration in the Adjutant-General’s Department.” Resolution .—In addressing the Government of India it should be stated that the redistribution of the armament on the Aden defences was generally approved as per Secretary Colonel Burne’s Letter, No. 578 S., dated 17th June 1878 (Armaments, Aden). The distribution of the eight dismounted 7-inch R.B.L. guns, however, would appear to have been carried out only to the following limited extent:— 2, Ras Tarshyne (two already mounted there), 1, Ras Morbut, in consequence of orders subsequently received from the Government of India, and quoted in the margin.* It should also be added that, since 1878, five 32-pdr. smooth-bore muzzle loading guns, which formerly were mounted in the Mole Battery, Morbut Fort, were returned into the arsenal, as they were no longer required there, the Mole battery having been converted * Letter to this Government, Public Works Department, No. 1088, M.

Without trenching on the recommendations of the Defence Committee for the improvement of the defences of Aden, His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief advocates that provision should be made for the more immediate needs of Aden in armament and improvised defence works, as the final adoption of the proposals of the Defence Committee will entail considerable delay and very heavy expenditure. 3. In this view His Excellency the Governor General in Council approves generally of the economical measures proposed in paras. 8 and 9 of the Quartermaster-General’s Letter, No. 14-1/3376, dated 11th ultimo, and will also commend to the Government of India the points noted in paras. 10 and 11 of that letter. It is most satisfactory that w'orks should remain in a state of apparent preparation or half demolition for years. 4. As regards para. 12 of the Quartermaster-General’s letter under disposal, extracts paras. 11, 20, and 21 of that Officer’s No. 1-5/1749, of 29th June 1881, should be sent to the Government of India, with an intimation that the subject of the removal of the arseual at Aden from its present position at the isthmus was referred to the Public Works Department, in connection with the question of providing increased barrack accommodation at Aden, and that Government concurred in the view of the Com- mander-in-Chief, as then expressed, that the removal of the arsenal to where the Peninsular and Oriental condensing yard is situated is not desirable. 6. The report of the Adjutant-General in respect to lubricants, cover for the rifled guns, &amp;c., will be awaited. 6. These reports, it is noticed, have not all been prepared in the manner prescribed . ^ ^ in the rules* laid down, the purport of which jg-.g was explained in paras, o to 8 ot Government Resolution, No. 2668, dated 19th May 1881, a copy of which, and of Government Resolutions noted in the margin,f should be t Government Resolution, No. 5438 of forwarded by the Quartermaster-General to the 1879.

To avoid further delay, the detailed descriptions of the Aden defences, by the Executive Engineer, will be ordered to be printed at the Central Press, and when completed, these, together with the other reports in original, and the plans, will be submitted to the Government of India for the consideration of the Defence Committee, in continuation of this Government docket, No. 3836, of 25th July 1881.

From Major-General F. Loch, C.B., Commanding Aden Brigade, to the Quarter master-General of the Army, Poona, No. 6-5/1890, Fortifications. (Annual Report dated Aden, the 23rd July 1881.) 1 * I have the honour to report that in accordance with the instructions conveyed in the rules wdiich accompanied Government Resolution, No. 3560, M. D., dated 16th July 1880, “ Defences and Fortifications Inspections,” I, accompanied’ by Colonel C.D.N. Lucas, commanding the Royal Artillery in this brigade, and Lieutenant- Colonel E. Mathew, Executive Engineer, Aden, inspected the fortifications and defences within my command, during the month of March last, and found them, and the armament mounted on them, generally in a good state of preservation. 2. Annexed are copies of the reports submitted by Lieutenant-Colonel Baker, second in command, Royal Artillery, Colonel Lucas, commanding the Royal Artillery, and a * p f t - , , , , letter, No. 6-1/515, of the 13th July 1881, sub- po a ,^;;lTl^Co“nL P D r e pat rf-S a report,* tables, and plans received ment. liom Lieutenant-Colonel Mathew, Executive Engineer. 3. ith regard to the latter, i.e., tables and plans, I would explain that I am aware the plans are not prepared in strict conformity with the instructions laid down in para. 1 of Rule II. of the rules above referred to, as the armament in each fort, capacity, &amp;c., are not entered on the face of each plan in the tabulated form directed; but, as this Report is now so long after the date on which it was ordered to be transmitted, I have ventured to submit them in their present form, to save further delay. 4. I would invite attention to various descriptions of armament (see table annexed) at present mounted on the Aden defences, no less than nine, and the manner in which the guns of different calibre are placed together in various forts, with a view, if possible, to some other arrangement being sanctioned, tvhereby guns of the same calibre and description may be mounted in the same forts, if not in the same batteries, as under the present arrangement, I fear, should it ever be found necessary to use the present 7193. B6 ordnance for the defence of the settlement, as the guns are now mounted, it would not only prove most difficult to supply the various positions with the different descrip tions of cartridges and projectiles required, hut that, having guns of so many different calibres in the same fort, it would probably cause confusion and sad mistakes on the part of those working the guns. 5. Many of the ordnance now mounted on the defences are old smooth-bore muzzle loading guns, of little or no use against the ordnance of the present day, and many of the carriages and platforms on which these guns are mounted bear date as far hack as 1844; and it seems very doubtful from their present appearance whether they would stand the concussion and recoil of more than 10 or 15 rounds from off them. 6. Under these circumstances, I would suggest the advisability of my being given authority to convene a Committee to draw up a report as to the number and descrip tion of all such guns as they would recommend being retained in position on the defences, and of those guns, carriages, and platforms which they would suggest being returned into the arsenal. This would decrease the heavy duties which the defence lascars are now called upon to perform, and it would ensure the reduced number of pieces of ordnance left in position being more thoroughly and efficiently looked alter ; it would decrease the quantity of lubricants and paint which is now used annually on these obsolete and, I may say, useless guns and carriages and platforms. 7. Should His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief approve of my suggestion, I would, with his sanction, appoint a Committee, consisting of Colonel Chads, 1st Bat talion, Wiltshire Regiment, Colonel Lucas, R.A., Lieutenant-Colonel Iredell, 14th Regiment Native Infantry, Lieutenant-Colonel Mathew, R.E., Executive Engineer, and Major Burgess, R.A., Commissary of Ordnance, to select such guns, carriages, and platform as they w^ould recommend being returned into the arsenal, and to draw up a report, showing the positions in which they would recommend the ordnance they advocate being retained should he mounted on the defences. 8. In my Letter, No. 24-9/59, dated 13th February 1878, to the address of the Adjutant-General of the Army, Bombay, I made certain suggestions regarding the redistribution of the armanent on the defences, wdiich were generally approved under Government Resolution, No. 3041, Military Department, of 24th June 1878. Since then, five 32-pounder, smooth-bore, muzzle-loading guns, which formerly were mounted in the Mole battery, Morbut Fort, were returned into the arsenal under the authority given in Letter, No. 1032, of the 16th February 1881, from the Assistant Adjutant- General, Royal Artillery, as they were no longer required there, the Mole battery having been converted into an open saluting battery, under the sanction accorded in Letter, No. 3717, dated 9th October 1879, from the Assistant Adjutant-General, Royal Artillery. 9. It is generally admitted by all who are acquainted with the settlement of Aden that, in the event of Aden ever being attacked, the probability is that it will be attacked from the seaward, and that consequently the forts and defences at Steamer Point are those to which our attention should be first directed. 10. It is also generally admitted, I believe, that one of the principal objects of an attack on Aden would he with a view to destroy the shipping, the water con densers, and the coal stacks, hut to do this a vessel would have to enter the inner harbour. 11. It is further allowed by every one who understands the subject, that the present defences at Steamer Point, that is, both the forts and defences themselves, as well as the armament mounted on them, are far behind the present times, and that, owing to the size and construction of the forts, they would prove rather a source of danger than of defence to the gunners working the guns during an attack, and that, owing to the small calibre of the guns at present mounted on them, an ironclad might lie in the offing and shell the forts, without the garrison being able to return her fire, and one of the new small gunboats, with a 38-ton gun on board, might creep up the opposite shore of the harbour, in shallow water, get into the inner harbour, work her wicked will, and return safely, well out of range of the fire from all the guns now in position at Steamer Point. 12. As a Committee on the Aden defences, composed of officers of the scientific branches, was assembled at Simla so late as the end of 1878, it would be presumptuous in me to offer an opinion as to what the description of defences or armaments requiredfor Steamer Point should be, but I feel sure that I am not at variance with the opinion arrived at by the Simla Committee, in recommending that Flint Island should he at once fortified by having two 9-inch M.L.R. guns behind shield, mounted on the west end of the island to protect the entrance to the inner harbour, with one 9-inch. R.B.L. gun in position behind a shield, at the opposite end of island, to cover the approach from the Ilujjaff, or little pass towards Steamei loint. 13 The sea face of Ras Tarshyne fort should be scarped to prevent any persons landing from boats, which they could do now with ease and safety, and the south face of the° range of hills running between Gold Mohur Valley, and the only road con necting the little pass and the main pass, should be scarped, to form an insurmountable ohstacfe to any troops landing at Gold Mohur Valley, which could easily be done. This I am aware, has been recommended by the Simla Committee, and, as proposed m my letter to the Adjutant General, No. 24-20/34;64, dated 22nd October 1878,1 would a°ain suggest that these two works might be carried out by the company oi Sappers and Miners stationed at Aden, when they have no other more important works on hand. 14. The present arsenal is not sufficiently large to contain the amount of ammunition and projectiles required for the garrison and the defences; it is placed in a most exposed position, and is too far from Steamer Point. In my opinion, the question of moving the arsenal to a less exposed position, and nearer to Steamer Point, is one of importance, and well deserving the speedy attention of the military authorities. 15. The question of lubricants referred to by Rieutenant-Colonel Baker and Colonel Lucas, R.A., is still under reference. The amount at present supplied is found to be inadequate. Better covering is required for the 9-inch and 7-inch M.L. and B.L.R. guns for, in a place like Aden, surrounded by the sea, and where, as a rule, a strong wind is constantly blowing, the elevating and traversing gear, unless properly lubricated and covered up, in a short time gets rusty and full of sand, which causes the gear to get out of order, and to deteriorate very rapidly. 16. I would not advocate a ditch being cut in front of the 9-inch M.L.R. gun in Ras Morbat, as recommended by Colonel Lucas, as the ditch would have to be cut in the solid rock, and would consequently necessitate a large outlay, which, in my opinion, would be sheer waste of money, as it is presumed the new defences planned by the Simla-Aden Defence Committee will ere long be sanctioned and commenced. 17. For the same reasons I would not recommend the slope of the 9-pdr. M.L.R. o*un batteries being faced with iron plates, under the muzzles of the guns, as suggested by Colonel Lucas. Concrete being so much cheaper, any damage done during the annual practice can easily be repaired at a slight cost. 18. Muzzle derricks and tramways for the 9-inch rifle M.L.R. guns should be supplied at each of the positions. From Lieutenant-Colonel E. H. Baker, R.A., to the Officer commanding Royal Artillery, Aden Brigade. (Annual Report on Royal Artillery Armament, dated 11th February 1881.) I have the honour to report, with reference to S.G.O. No. 69 of 1880, that I have inspected the armament of Aden, and found the ordnance, ammunition, and store in good order, and fit for service. The amount of oil allowed for the smooth-bore guns Fn position does not appear to be sufficient. From the want of it some of the elevating screws of the guns on the Mansoorie height are being eaten up with rust, their only protection being a strip of old wax cloth. A larger allowance of cloth for cleansing is also wanted. There are some great guns which might be returned into store, more especially those lately forming the Mole battery, and now displaced to make room for the saluting battery. Shell rooms are required for some of the batteries. I would draw attention to the risk to which ammunition and stores are exposed in Ras Morbut and Ras Tarshyne forts, the ditches having been filled up in certain places, and there being no guards over them. More store rooms are required lor the proper preservation and arrangement of stores belonging to the various batteries.&gt; 8 Remarks by Officer Commanding Royal Artillery, Aden Brigade. The question of more oil has been, and still is, the subject of a lengthened corre spondence Avith head-quarters of the army. The ditch of Ras Tarshyne has been protected by palisades, where filled in, but that of Ras Morbut cannot be so protected, as the guns are in position over the spots filled in. The wall being considered too weak to withstand the concussion of the guns, I would suggest the ditch should be continued outside these fillings in, leaving them as buttresses; thus the wall would be sufficiently strengthened and the fort protected. There are a number of obsolete pattern guns on the defences, and as the Defence Committee’s proceedings have been published, I would suggest that sanction be obtained to so far remove these guns as can be done without leaving any position defenceless. The outer slope of the 9-inch gun batteries are made of concrete, and after one or two rounds becomes so much destroyed as to require expensive repairs every year. If sheet iron were placed under the muzzle, this could be avoided. It has been tried at Bombay, and proved perfectly successful. Muzzle derricks and tramways are needed for 9-inch guns in every position. Many of the small stores and others are of obsolete pattern, and authority will be applied for to return them, and draw those of proper pattern. Shell rooms are much required in many forts, as also side arms. Magazines.—Several of the powder magazines have not copper sheeting on the doors, which will be applied for, and all the magazines require lamp passages, and most much need ventilation. (Signed) C.

Steamer Point Position and Perim Island. . Tarshyne fort is situated on a knoll 120 feet high, near the south edge of the hill. It is a redoubt somewhat in the shape of a horseshoe, and surrounded by an unflanked dry ditch 17 feet wide and 13 feet deep, partly cut out of the rock *and partly revetted. In the ditch and under the glacis on either side of the entrance are the magazines and shell rooms. The terre-plein of the fort is flush with the top of the knoll. In this fort are emplacements for six guns all en barbette, with a masonry traverse 9 feet thick between one pair of guns, and a similar traverse 20 feet wide, in which is located a shell room, between another pair. Three guns are on low masonry platforms, one foot above the terre-plein of the fort, firing over a parapet 4 feet high, and having a superior slope 22 j feet thick. The other three guns are on the terre-plein of the ramparts firing over a parapet 4 feet high, and having superior slopes 18 feet, 19J feet, and 22 feet thick respectively. The ramparts and parapets throughout consist of stones, earth, and sand. The fort is imperfectly enclosed. Has Morbut fort is situated on the high ground at the eastern end of the hill, 120 feet high, and is a redoubt with a masonry keep separated by a dry ditch 20 feet wide and 11 feet deep, and surrounded by another dry ditch 15J feet wide and 13 feet deep, both ditches being unflanked. In the basement of the keep are situated the magazines and water tanks, over which, on the first floor, is bomb-proof casemate accommodation for troops; and over the latter on the top of the keep are emplacement for four guns en barbette firing over parapets 4| feet high. The crest of the keep is 16J feet above the crest of the parapet of the outer work, the total height being 33 feet. The outer work consists of a terre-plein 30 feet wide, with emplacements for six guns on masonry platforms raised 2J feet above the terre-plein, and firing over parapets 4 feet 10 inches high through very wide embrasures, and having masonry traverses between them. The parapets consist of stone and lime masonry, and have a superior slope 10 feet thick. The ditches are cut out of the hill. The inner one is revetted throughout and has its bot tom paved ; the outer one is partly in rock and partly revetted. The fort is imperfectly enclosed. West Cliff battery is a temporary open battery near the western extremity of Has Morbut hill, 200 yards from the fort on the top. The command of the fort* over the battery is 20 feet, and of the keep, 36^ feet. The battery has emplacements for four 9-inch 12-ton guns firing en barbette over parapets 4£ feet high, with masonry traverses containing shell rooms between them. The parapets have a superior slope of 19 feet, and consist of stones, earth, and sand, with an interior slope revetment of 2 feet masonry. In rear of the guns is a magazine sunk below the ground, while at the south end, or left flank, of the battery, is an epaulment 105 feet long, having a superior slope 26 feet thick, and consisting of earth and sand with 2 feet masonry interior slope revetment, against which, under a lean-to roof, are two store rooms for tackle, &amp;c. Mole battery is situated on the shore at the north-west extremity of the Has Morbut hill on a low spur of rock jutting into the sea. On the hill side is a masonry wall 2.^ feet thick, and of an average height of 5. 1 5 feet, in which an opening, fitted with a low palisade gate, forms the entrance. The battery is formed by a thick masonry retaining wall round its south and west sides, carried up from the rock to a height of 15 feet above high water mark, on which formerly stood the parapets, and by a thinner retaining wall along the north side from the hill to the end of the thick wall, the space between the walls being filled in with stones, earth, and sand. In the battery there were originally emplacements along the south face for four guns on wooden platforms firing through very narrow embrasures, and for one gun on the west face on a raised masonry platform with flat racer firing en barbette over a masonry parapet 4 feet high.I 15 In rear of the guns and close to the north wall is a magazine and a shell room built below the terre-plein. As it now stands, this battery is quite open, without any parapets, and is used solely for saluting purposes. In it are placed at the western end six 12-pdr. S. B. guns, in front of which is a low iron railing, and in rear of them, near the centre of the battery, is a flagstaff. The magazine has been isolated from the battery by a masonry wall 5 feet high, and an entrance to it has been formed by fixing a timber gate in the north wall on a level with the magazine floor. A new piece of roadway leading from this gate along the beach to the pilot bunder gives access to the magazine. These arrangements were carried out in order that the magazine might be utilized solely for harbour (Port Fund) purposes. It is understood that the Simla Defence Committee do not contemplate constructing a work on the site of the Mole battery, and that the conversion of the Mole battery into a mere saluticg battery and the isolation of the magazine do not affect their scheme. General Lithographed Plan of Aden. Flint island is situated one mile up the harbour from the light ship on Ras Morbut, and lies lengthways in the deep water channel, 250 yards from the foreshore. At high water its length is 100 yards, and its breadth varies from 50 yards at the south-western end to 25 yards at the north-eastern. Three years ago its height (greatest) was 47 feet. But it was then cut down to a uniform height of 23 feet above high-water mark, in preparation for fortifying it in accordance with the Simla Defence Committee’s designs. It now presents a bare platform, having a length of 19 yards and a breadth of 30 yards at the south-western end, diminishing to 11 yards at the north-eastern. Previously, there existed at the southern end an old masonry battery for three guns (not mounted), with narrow deep embrasures. Granite Curbs for 9-inch 12-ton Guns at Aden. Lying on the hill outside Ras Morbut fort are 10 sets of Aberdeen granite curbs of racers for the 9-mch 12-ton guns at Aden, as follows :— 4 sets for the guns in West Cliff battery. 2 „ ,, Ras Morbut fort. 2 ,, ,, Ras Tarshyne fort. 2 „ „ Seera fort. Total - 10 sets „ or 140 blocks. The curbs were received from England in September 1879. Flagstaff hill is a conical hill immediately in rear of Ras Morbut, commanding it, and a considerable portion of the hill slopes to the eastward and south-eastward. It is 58 feet above the parapet of the keep of Ras Morbut fort, or 191 feet (190 - 75 feet) above high-water mark. Several years ago it was scarped below the summit to depths varying from 14 feet to 40 feet, increased on north side (probably by quarrying) to 60 feet. Perim Island.

Four 7-inch B.L.R., 82 cwt., of which three are on B pivot raised racers, and one on D pivot flat racers. constructed when the two 32-ton In this fort are mounted “ en barbette ” guns of the description and calibre noted in the margin.* A traverse, 24 feet broad and 12 feet high, was guns were mounted, in which a shell room, 12 ft. X 7 ft. X 7 ft. interior dimensions, is situated. A paved way, 4 feet wide, com municates with this room and the two 9-iuch guns on either side. There are no other traverses. There is no casemate accommodation. The magazines and shell rooms are situated in the ditch and under the glacis at the gorge. The magazine on the left of the entrance is 17 ft. XlO ft.x6 ft. to springing of arched head, and is reached by a flight of stone steps in the corner of the battery to the left of No. 1 gun. This magazine was constructed when the 9-inch 12-ton guns were mounted, there not being sufficient accommodation to meet the extra requirements for these guns. In the ditch, to the right of the entrance, are situated one shell room, lOf ft. XlO ft. and one magazine, 12 ft. XlO ft.x7 ft. to springing of arched head! Between these there is an open space, 9j; ft. X 9 ft., beyond which and the last-men tioned magazine is another shell room, 15| ft,X9 ft., and another magazine, 16 ft. x9 ft. X 7 ft to springing of arched head, built in under the glacis of the fort. These magazines and shell rooms are reached by a ladder through an opening in the parapet wall of the fort and down through the open space between the two ^former. The sides of this ladder are formed into a tramway, on which runs a light truck raised and lowered by means of a rope running through a pulley at top, and used for lifting materials from the rooms below. A room for small stores and tackle is situated just inside the gate, as shown in red dotted lines on plan. It is 17 ft. X 8 ft. X 8 ft., and has a lean-to roof, sunk 2 feet below r the crest. A masonry tank, 8 ft. x7 ft. and 5 feet deep, to contain 1,750 gallons of w-ater, is situated near the centre of the fort, having w'alls 2 feet thick, resting on the rock, a bottom of concrete, 1| feet thick, and a cover of 6 inches of concrete resting on teak timbers supported by walls. The parapets of this fort are about 22 feet broad, and consist of earth and sand, with a masonry revetment, 2 feet thick. Fas Morbut Fort {Keep and Outer Battery). Plan No. 2. The masonry citadel or keep measures 80 ft. X 68 ft. in exterior dimensions, and is 32 feet high from its ditch, the walls being loopholed for musketry fire. It is almost rectangular in shape, the most curved end having a versed sine of 16J feet to a chord of 65 feet. On the summit of this keep are mounted “ en barbette ” guns of the description and f Four 8-inch, 50-cwt., S. B. calibre as noted in the margin ;f while within, on a floor level with the terre-plem of the surrounding battery, are situated three bomb-proof casemates of the following dimensions, for troops. A central casemate 64 ft. X13 ft. 10 in., and two others, one on each sffie of and separated by masonry walls 4 ft. 3 in. thick from the latter, each measuring 43 ft 3 in. X13 ft. 10 in., with an additional room 13 ft. 10 in. square at one end of each, separated from them by masonry walls 2 feet thick. In the basement below are three magazines j a central one, measuring 42 ft. x 12 ft. X 6 ft. to springing of arched heads, and two side magazines, each 34 ft. X12 ft. X 6 ft., separated from the former by masonry walls 6 feet thick. A passage 5 feet wide, and a stone staircase 3 feet wide in the side wall, give access from17 s ' ■' p U the casemates to the magazine, while a similar staircase in the rear wall of the keep gives access to the guns on the top. There are also three connected tanks in the basement, each 12J ft. X 11| ft. X 5i ft. to springing of arched head, having a common opening in the casemate’s floor. The keep is separated from the outer lower battery by a dry ditch 20 feet wide and 11 feet deep, and has a “ command ” over it of 16J feet. In the outer battery there are emplacements for six guns. The rampart and parapet in front of these guns measure about 29 feet and 11 feet respectively, and are composed of moorum with loose stones. The masonry traverses are 8 feet broad. The ditch is 15| feet wide and about 13.^ feet deep. There are at present mounted two guns, as per margin,* in such position as to command the harbour from the outer buoy beyond the light ship to Flint Island. The traverse between the two 9-inch guns and that on their left flank have been strengthened by concrete walls 6 feet thick carried round the three exposed sides. In the former is located a shell room, 12 ft. X 7 ft. X 7 ft. The terre-plein of the rampart in front of these guns has been raised 2 ft. 3 in., so as to keep the floor of the shell room and the gun racers on the same level, while the parapet in front has been strengthened by filling in the outer ditch in front of each gun. Access to this fort is obtained by curved passages through the glacis and ramparts, provided with two palisade gates leading to the south-east corner of the keep, the keep itself being entered over a drawbridge near the north-east corner. The outer battery can he entered over the filling-in mentioned in the last paragraph. • Two 9*inch M. L. R., 12-ton. One 7-inch B. L. R., 82 cwt. West Cliff Battery on Has Morbut {called Temporary). Plan No. 3. In this open battery, under and 200 yards from the fort, are mounted “ en barbette ” guns as per margin.f f Four 9-mch 12-ton M.L.R. These guns have a lateral range of 120 degrees, firm 0 * over a parapet 4 ft. 3 in. high, and mounted on raised racers with A pivot. In each of the concrete covered traverses is a shell room, measuring 14 ft. X 7 ft. X 7ft. (interior dimensions). Paved ways 4 feet wide in rear of the traverses communicate between the guns and the shell rooms. The parapets, consisting of earth and sand, are 24 feet broad, including a cast chunam revetment, 2 feet thick. In the rear of this battery, and 38 feet from the traverses, is a sunk magazine, 15 feet long by 12 feet wide by 6 feet to springing of arched head (interior dimen sions). The magazine and passages are arched over, and the whole building protected from vertical fire by a padding 8 feet thick of concrete. Close by the magazine is an old cast-iron water tank built in the rock, its upper edo-e being almost flush with the ground. It has no cover, and, being broken in many places, could not be utilized in its present state to hold water. The battery is protected at the south end by an epaulement 105 feet in length, and of an average breadth of 25 feet, along the inner face of which, under a lean-to roof, are two rooms for small stores (each 17 ft. X 8 ft. X 8 ft., in which are provided the necessary shelves, racks, &amp;c.) for four 12-ton guns. The crest is carried back horizontally from a height of 13 feet at the battery, to meet the hill which slopes upwards from the rear of the battery. Mole Battery, Bos Morbut {now Saluting Battery). Plan No. 4. This is an open battery built on rock projecting into the sea in a north-westerly direction from the foot of Ras Morbut. On it, until about a year ago, when they were dismounted, were guns as per margin.^ The first four guns were on timber platforms, l Two 32-pdrs., 58 cwt. an( j played through embrasures in the masonry parapet along the south-western face of the battery towards the entrance of the harbour, while the fifth gun was mounted on a flat racer, D pivot, in the west corner, and was served “ en barbette ” over a parap t 44 feet high. 7193. E Ditto ditto, 56 cwt. One 32-pdr, 58 cwt., on flat racer, D pivot.18 The entrance to this battery is from the hill side through a palisade gate in a stone and lime masonry wall, which is of an average height and thickness of 5^ feet and 2J feet respectively. This battery was and is now in exterior dimensions 143 feet long and 67 J feet in mean width, the soles of the former embrasures being about 15 feet above high-water level. In it on the north-eastern face a magazine 8^ ft. X 6 ft. X 4 ft. to springing of arched head, and a store room 10 ft. X 8 ft. X 6| ft., both sunk to their full height below the terre-plein of the battery, and separated from each other by an open passage 5 feet wide. A flight of stone steps between them and the north-eastern wall of the battery gives access to both. The parapets were of stone and lime masonry, of an average thickness of 8J feet. They were removed when the guns were dismounted, as noted above, and the battery was converted into a saluting battery ; and sinco then the magazine has been isolated by a masonry wall round three sides of it to admit of its being handed over to the Harbour Department for use in storing ships’ powder. As it now stands, this battery is entirely open save on the hill side, where there is the wall with entrance gate. On it, at the outer or north-western end, are placed six guns as per margin,* which are used solely for saluting purposes. In the centre of the terre-plein is fixed a flagstaff. Six 12-pdr. 34 cwts.

The Isthmus Position is included between the line of fortifications traced diagonally from N.W. to S.E., across the isthmus and the Johar and the Munsoorie ranges, which meet the line on either flank. On the left (N.W.) flank the Johar range terminates in Jebbel Hadded, close to the harbour shore ; on the right (S.E.) flank, the Munsoorie range projects into Ras-el-Erig, meeting the sea. A spur running out from the junction of the two ranges divides the position into the larger and smaller isthmus, and terminates just in front of the line in Ras-el-Gereff. The larger and smaller isthmus are connected by a tunnel 131 yards long, through the dividing spur. From the smaller isthmus a road ascends to another tunnel, 348 yards long, pierced through the Munsoorie range for communication with the crater. Through a gap near the termination of the Johar range is a fortified entrance from the harbour side, called the Western Gate. At the isthmus entrance of the large tunnel are embrasures for two guns, to enfilade the tunnel. In front is a dry ditch, 30 feet wide by 9 feet deep. On the flank is a bridge, 12 feet wide, for traffic. A magazine, 5 ft. X 5 ft., is built in rear of the battery. Barrier Gate and Tower and Bier of Obstruction* Plan No. 6. Two hundred yards from the Western Gate entrance, along the shore towards the harbour, is the Barrier Gate and Tower, between the Johar hill side and the water; and running out at right angles from this point of the harbour shore is the pier of obstruction. r lhe tower has an exterior height of 30 feet, and contains a vaulted guard room 24 ft. X16 ft. and 16 feet high (area=384 square feet, cubic space 6,144 cubic feet, or 55 square feet and 878 cubic feet per man). It is approached by steps through an antechamber 8 ft. X8 ft., and two strong doors, one to the barrack and the other in the vaulted entry to the antechamber. A magazine 8 ft. X 8 ft. X 8 ft., area =64 square feet, cubic space=512 cubic feet, communicates with the guard room. Above is an open terrace, to which the ascent from the guard room is by a ladder. In the outer angle of the terrace is a traversing platform for one 24-pounder. The parapet wall is furnished with a double banquette, and is also loopholed. Its thickness in front of the gun is 4 feet, but in other places only 2 feet. The pier is 530 feet in length from the tower, and terminates in a depth of 4 feet water at lowest ebb. Its northern face is revetted with masonry, and, including a parapet (wdth banquettes) 6 ft. 6 in. high, wfith two openings for landing, presents an exterior height which is in no place less than 12 feet. The roadway, exclusive of the banquettes, is 20 feet wide. The south edge is sloped off and pitched. Western Gateway Bedan. Plan No. 7.

Walls and Bitch on the Southern Slope of Jebbel Hadded. Plan No. 8. From the Gateway Bedan a steep flight of steps with landings, laid out in plan “ en crdmaillere,” leads to an arched doorway at the south-w estern end of the Jebbel Hadded work. The parapet w r all along the front is loopholed at the landings at the salient and re-entering angles. The escarp is 32 feet, obtained partly by rubble w alling ami partly by scarping th^ rock, and thereby forming a ditch.Defensive Works on the Top of the Jebbel Hadded. Plan No. 8. The enclosed platform, which is about 230 feet above sea level, is 430 feet long, with a breadth varying from 54 to 90 feet within the parapet walls. In the centre of the platform is a guard room (18 ft. X14 ft. X10 ft., area =252 square feet, cubic space =2,520 cubic feet) the roof of which is terraced and surrounded by a loopholed parapet wall. The escarp is 30 feet, formed partly of the scarped rock and partly of rubble masonry. The parapet wall in continuation of it is 3 feet thick, and is loopholed at the angles and flanks, and at intervals in the faces. Wall and Ditch on the Eastern Slope of the Jebbel Uadded. Plan No. 8. Prom the return of the western flank of the isthmus line of works the ditch and rampart are continued 25 yards towards Jebbel Hadded, and a sallyport with a draw bridge are there provided. The rampart is then discontinued, being changed into a parapet wall, with stepped banquette running up the hill, the ditch, with glacis, being carried up to a natural scarp in the eastern face of the Jebbel Hadded. Prom the commencement of the ascent the mean height of the escarp is increased to 32 feet, and at the upper end the rock is scarped in part, thereby forming an irregular ditch. The escarp and counterscarp at the lower end are of masonry backed with dry rubble. The counterscarp here is 2 feet higher than on the plain.

On the side towards the harbour and road to the interior is a massive cut stone gateway, 9 feet thick, having above it a loopholed parapet wall, which is carried round towards the extremity of the Shum Shum range as a returned flanking wall, to a rifle tower, 10 feet square inside; and thence, as a dead wall, 34 feet thick and 16 feet high, up the steep cliff of the range. On the side towards the crater is a loopholed wall, 2^ feet thick, and gate in line behind a ditch 10 feet wide, crossed by a fixed wooden bridge, forming an obstacle at the summit of the Pass, here cut perpendicularly through the rock at the junction of the Shum Shum and Munsoorie range. In the open space, mainly obtained by rock cutting, northward of the former entrance, is a battery for two guns “en barbette,” having a cut stone parapet, 6 feet high and 3 feet thick, with stepped banquette, returned on the right to meet the hill side, over- looking the Pass and ground to the westward of it, on the harbour side, from a height of 213 feet. The rock in front of the battery is cut to form an escarp 26 feet deep, and, where loose, is revetted with masonry. A magazine, guard room, and latrine are provided. A path and a covered way, which is entered by means of a small door protected by a blind wall, lead to a masonry bridge spanning the pass on the Crater side, at a height of 70 feet above ther roadway. The bridge has loopholed parapet walls 6 feet high, and stepped banquettes for fire on the Crater side of the Pass and for command over the battery. From the bridge the covered way is continued to meet the Shum Shum cliff, and terminates, after a steep stepped ascent, in a small circular musketry post having a parapet 6 feet high and 2-J feet thick, with an escarp of 29 feet, and commanding the Main Pass battery. A similar covered way leads to Bell’s battery. Bell's Battery. Plan No. 13. Is on the top of a conical hill immediately above the Main Pass battery, and commands it and its approaches, and the ground from Jabbel Hadded to the Little Pass on the harbour side, and from Kusaff valley to High Munsoorie on the Crater side.

Government of India, submitting a report on the defences of the principal harbours of India, drawn up by the Special Committee appointed in 1877. Sir, 2. The Marquis of Hartington will be glad to be favoured with any remarks which the proposal of the Committee may suggest, and I am to make it a special request that the subject of the Aden defences may receive Mr. Childers’ early attention. 3. The Secretary of State for War will observe that the Government of India lav great stress on the importance of making very early provision for the security of Aden,32 and are prepared to contribute their fair share of the cost of the new works, provided that Her Majesty’s Government will, on their part, afford the assistance which the Government of India consider that they are entitled to expect, in view of the general political interests involved in the security of this possession. 4. Bearing in mind the position which Aden holds towards all Her Majesty’s Eastern possessions putside India, and its great importance to the general commercial interests of the Empire, Lord Hartington entirely concurs in the justice of this view, and will he glad to receive from Mr. Secretary Childers the expression of his opinion as to the extent to which Her Majesty’s Government will be prepared to co-operate with the Government of India, in defraying the cost of the works which may be considered necessary. 5. Lord Hartington understands that Colonel Crossman, B.E., is at present engaged professionally in reporting for the War Office on the coast defences of the British colonies. If, during this duty, he could visit Aden at a very early date, doubtless the Government of India would derive much benefit from the experience he would bring to the consideration of this project, and I shall be glad to learn if this can be arranged for.

Mr. Childers understands that Aden is one of the 'stations the defence of which is under consideration by the Royal Commission on the Defence of British Possessions and Commerce Abroad, and he would suggest that a copy of the Report of the Indian Coast Defence Committee, before referred to, might with advantage be transmitted to the Commission through the Colonial Office. With respect to the proposal that a part of the cost of these defences should fall on the Imperial Exchequer, Mr. Childers does not, at present, see reason to make any recommendation to that effect to the Lords Commissioners of Her Majesty’s Treasury, but as he understands that the Royal Commission is considering similar questions with regard to the cost of defensive works in other British possessions, he thinks that their opinion might be of value, and should be requested.

I have, &amp;c., * (Signed) Ralph Thompson. The Under Secretary of State for India. Confidential, No. 73. London, Sir, 16th June 1882. In compliance with the instructions contained in your letter, No. 40,051/137, dated the 2nd November 1881, directing me to report upon the defensive capabilities of Aden, I have the honour to state that I arrived at that place on the 11th May last, and I have to report as follows. The question of the defence of Aden has been carefully and fully gone into. Pirst, in 1870, by a Committee, of which General Tremenhere was President. Second, by Lieutenant-General Sir William Jervois in 1872. Third, by the Defence Committee of India in 1879, presided over by Lieutenant- General Sir Alexander Taylor, R.E. I have carefully read and studied the reports on the ground, and also the Memo randum of the Inspector General of Eortifications of the 28th November 1880, and have examined the sites of the existing and proposed works of defence. The value of Aden as a coaling and refitting station for Her Majesty’s fleet, and its important strategical position in Eastern seas, has been so fully set forth in the reports above referred to, and the topographical features of the place have been so fully described in the exhaustive report of Sir W. Jervois, that it is unnecessary now to make any further remarks on this part of the subject. As regards the nature of attack to which it is probable that Aden would be liable, there would appear to be a divergence of opinion between Sir W. Jervois and the Indian Defence Committee. The former officer {see para. 89 of his report) provides for “ defence against an attack by a squadron of ironclad vessels armed with powerful &lt;c guns.” The Indian Defence Committee, on the other hand (para. 14 of their report), are of opinion that “ a system of defence calculated to repulse the attack of a few vessels, “ ironclad or others, that may have escaped the vigilance of our fleet will satisfactorily “ meet the requirements of the case.” On reference, however, to the two reports, it will be seen that in both the same defensive positions are recommended, and virtually the same armament, the extra strength provided by Sir W. Jervois being in placing the heavy guns of the harbour defences behind iron shields. As these guns are at an elevation in the two principal batteries of over 100 feet above the sea, it would appear that if mounted en barbette, as proposed by the Com mittee, they would still be most efficient against such an attack as is • contemplated under the first supposition. As, in the War Office Memorandum, it is stated that “ under no circumstances “ could Great Britain allow Aden to fall into the hands of any other Power,” it is necessary to consider its defences under Head I. of the conditions furnished by the j\T 37 “ Royal Commission on the Defence of British Possessions and Commerce Abroad,” viz., that it must be considered a “ port of refuge and refitting station in which ships may lie m security. 1 The accompanying table A shows the works and armament proposed in each of the schemes before-mentioned, and it would appear only necessary for me to briefly recapitulate the various proposals under the head of each work, and from them nut forward a scheme which will embody generally the views of those who have advisable COnSK ered ^ ' 5 1 bject ’ with such alterations as I may venture to consider three headt n -— ° f ^ taken ’ ^ ^ beeU d ° ne “ a11 I )revious reports, under A.

Jervois, to 5 in War Office Memorandum Unless placed behind iron shields there would not be room for the larger number - but &gt; considering the importance of the position, I would recommend that the number should be as proposed by the Defence Committee, namely: Three to command outer anchorages and approaches. One, ditto, and to fire round to the upper end of the inner bay. Three to command the inner anchorage and fire along ^shore towards the Little Pass. The four first should be 10• 4-inch B.L.R. guns, and the other three, which would not have to oppose heavily armoured vessels, 9-inch M.L.R. guns.

M.L.R. guns in Moncrieff pits, to fire inland over the slopes from Shum Shum and the low ground towards Telegraph Bay, and to command Bas Tarshayne. Casemated cover is provided for the garrison in time of action, but it is not proposed to place any barracks in the work. The battery is thus designed for— Pour 10* 4-inch B.L.R. guns. Five 9-inch M.L.R. guns. Two 64-pdr. M.L.R. guns. Two machine guns. The garrison required would be— For the service of the guns - 165 men, of whom 110 would be Artillery. In addition - - - 50 Infantry. Total - - - 215 men. The cost of the work as estimated by the Committee is 46,032Z. This includes 7,500Z. for an iron shield for the gun on front salient; if this be deducted the cost may be put down at--- - - - -- £40,000 Armament (9-inch guns on spot) - - - _ . 20,000 Total - - - . . . . £60,000 To this should be added the cost of the lowering of Flagstaff Hill, as recommended in all the various reports.

Ras Tar shayne battery. The work at present here mounts four 7-inch B.L.R. guns and four 8-inch S.B. guns of 65 cwt. It is cramped and confined, and the guns are neither of sufficient power nor are they properly mounted. The Committee propose that the work be entirely remodelled and made self- defensible, and that there should be mounted on it two 38-ton guns and three 18-ton guns firing to seaward. Sir W. Jervois proposes six heavy guns, and the War Office Memorandum four. In this case, as at Ras Morbut, I recommend that the number proposed by the Committee be adopted, and that five 10'4-in. B.L.R. guns be placed on this point, all firing to seaward from the point below Ras Morbut round to Telegraph Bay, and that two 64-pdr. M.L.R. guns be mounted on the left of the work and at a lower level to sweep the beach and fire into Telegraph Bay. The 64-pdr. recommended by the War Office Memo randum on the right would be of little use, nor would it appear necessary to place two 80-pdr. guns in the gorge of the work as proposed by the Committee. It would be better to allow this work to be open to and commanded by Ras Morbut, and merely to protect the rear against surprise, for which purpose two machine guns should be provided. The battery will therefore be for,— Five 10 - 4-inch B.L.R. guns. Two 64-pdr. M.L.R. guns. Two machine guns. Cost. £ W ork 28,500 Armament 24,000 Total 52,500 Garrison.

The cost of the work is estimated at Armament - Total £ 28.500 24,000 52.500 Detailed drawings and estimates for the above works have been prepared and are now in India,—it would he well if application were made for copies. Contoured plans of the ground on a large scale are also in existence, so that it would be possible to modify the plans in the War Office, if found necessary, to make alterations so as to adapt the works to the latest requirements. The description of the works given in the Committee’s report of 1879 has rendered it unnecessary for me to go into any details, as it is so full as to enable the authorities at home to see clearly even without a plan, the principles upon which these works have been designed. Flint Island. Guns on Flint Island have been recommended in all reports. As laid down in page 11, para. 39, of the Committee’s report, “ their object is,— et 1. To bring, with the guns at Das Morbut, a cross fire on the entrance to the harbour. “ 2. To flank that part of the northern shore of the peninsula on which are located the water condensers, as well as the coal and other depots. “ 3. To command the shoal water lying to the northward ; and “4. To bring an effective fire to bear on the c Little Pass ’ and on the road from that pass to Steamer Point.” As regards the first of these conditions, it will be seen, on reference to the chart, that any fire directed from the island upon vessels approaching the harbour would be over the main part of the inner anchorage, which would, probably, in event of attack, be occupied by our own vessels. In that case, a cross fire with Pas Morbut could not be obtained except at extreme ranges. But the other conditions are important, and although gunboats would do all that is required for the defence of the upper part of the bay, still they might not be available to command the approaches by the road, either to the west or east of the Little Pass, or to protect the condensers and coal stores on the shores of the bay. For this purpose, guns of position are recommended in the War Office Memorandum at the Little Pass, but it would be better, I submit, giving up the idea of placing a work on Flint Island, to place instead a small battery on the Hedjif, the high ground immediately to the south of the road at the Little Pass. The ground is about 120 feet above the sea, affords a good site for a battery—though a good deal of levelling on the top of the hill may be required, and it could easily be rendered perfectly secure by scarping the cliff. Guns placed here would command the road leading from the Main Pass, and cover the retreat of the garrison of the Crater if driven out; and, on the other side, would flank the beach towards Steamer Point, and prevent any raid by boats in that direction. In connection with this work, too, could be placed the barrier gate and drawbridge across the road, as proposed by General Tremenhere. One heavy gun, placed at the extreme northern end, would also command the upper end of the bay, and to a greater extent than a gun placed on Flint Island. The armament of this battery would be :— One 9-inch M.L.B. gun at northern salient. Two 61-pdr. M.L.B. guns on western side. One 9-inch M.L.R. gun. Four 64-pdr. M.L.R. guns.

For the guns - - 75 men (of whom 50 would be Artillery). Infantry - - 50 Total - - 125 men. To accommodate these men a guard room would be required in connection with the barrier gate. In Telegraph Bay landing would be prevented by the work at Tarshayne ; there is also good landing on the beach in both divisions of the Gold Mohur Bay, and it -would be possible for a body of men landed there, if unopposed, to climb up the western slopes of the Shum Shum range at the head of the Gold Mohur Valley, and, by occupying the ridge somewhere at the point A marked on the plan, turn the defences of the Little Pass, and also seriously incommode by musketry fire the defenders in the sea batteries. That the ascent of the hill is practicable is proved by the fact that two companies of British infantry made the ascent some time ago, when only one man fell out on the way. To provide against this, the ground should be carefully examined, and all accessible places scarped. The sides of the Gold Mohur Valley near the sea should also be scarped, to prevent an enemy advancing along the shore. It would be desirable to establish a small block house at some point on the ridge (AA on plan) between the valley and the descent to the low ground east of the Little Pass, in which a few men stationed in time of attack would effectually prevent any attempt at a surprise in that direction. The Steamer Point position would thus be complete in itself, and any attack by sea or land. Infantry, 150 men. Cost. Work and scarping, 2,000/. fortified against Submarine Mines, The configuration of the harbour and its approaches is not such as to permit of the employment of submarine mines on any regular system. 2 qqq} A few detached groups of electro-contact mines or ’ • ground mines, fired singly by one observation would be Engineers, oO men. useful if laid in the offing, and in positions where ships would probably manoeuvre against the batteries.

It is to be regretted that the Peninsular and Oriental Company and the Messagenes Maritimes have°been allowed to occupy the hill adjacent to the military hospital The land can be resumed at any time, and it would be well if inquiries were made as to the amount of compensation likely to be asked for if notice were given to these Companies to remove. Their buildings could probably be made available for Officers ^TheTotS^ost^of* the scheme for the Steamer Point Defences, as here put forward, exclusive of a new barrack, is,— dJ Works - - - - 78,700 Armament - &lt; - 46,800 Submarine mines - - 2,000 Gunboats - &lt; - 26,000 Steam launches - - 4,000 Total . £157,500 Little Aden. I inspected the ground at Little Aden on the opposite side of the harbour, and Little Aden, found that at the bluff (see chart), about 100 feet above the sea, there is a good site on which could be erected a battery to mount at least six heavy guns, to bear upon the harbour and approaches. A work here, with its armament and barrack accommo dation, would probably cost at least 80,000£. Considering its isolated position, it would be better, as recommended by Sir W. Jervois, to trust to the gunboats for the purpose of preventing ships of shallow draught of water taking up a position near that shore and firing on the bay. B.—Isthmus Defences. The existing defences here are described in paras. 77 to 80 of Sir W. Jervois s Isthmus report. Salients. Five 64-pdr. M.L.R. guns. Flanks. Ten 8 in. S.B. guns. 7193. Defences.

It would he well to ~ reduce this number, and substitute, as proposed, 64-pdr. M.L.R. guns at the salients, and replace the guns in the flanks by the best of the lightest S.B. guns at the station. It is worthy of consideration, however, whether the ___ substitution of machine guns in the flanks w r ould not be Total - £5,300 advisable. Though an extra sum would be required for armament, the number of artillerymen required would be considerably reduced. Instead of 100 men being required for the flanks, not more than 30 would be necessary. It would not appear necessary to mount a gun in the tower at El (lerif in the centre c a t t r&gt; r. °f tl ie lines, nor is a gun on Jebbel Huddeed required One 64-pdr.

As, however, a gun on this latter point would, in addition to firing down the isthmus, bring a plunging fire to bear on the head of Aden Bay, a 64-pdr. M.L.B. gun should be placed there, w r hich, besides firing over the isthmus, would cross fire with the gun at the salient of the Hedjif battery. No further work is required at the iTower Gate. To prevent surprise in that direction from the isthmus, two 8-inch S.B. guns may be substituted for the four 24-pdrs. at the Gateway Bedan. The escarps of the lines should be repaired, and all native footpaths, of wdiich one runs up under Jebbel Huddeed, should be destroyed. For the Isthmus defences are now proposed:— Two 8-inch S.B. above sea level. guns, 28 feet On salients Jebbel Huddeed In flanks Gateway redan Five 64-pdr. M.L.B. guns. One 64-pdr. M.L.B. gun (also to fire over head of Aden Bay.) Ten 8-inch S.B. guns, or ten machine guns. Two 8-inch S.B. guns.

If machine guns are provided in the flanks, this number might be reduced to— 68 artillery, and 184 infantry. Total - 244 men. In this case, the cost of the armaments would be increased by about 3,000/.43 V Three 10-inch M. L. R. guns (on lower plateau, 200 feet above the sea). Two 8-inch S.B. guns (on tower), 375 feet above the sea. Crater Defences. Although, if a landing were effected in Front Bay or Holcut Bay, any advance on crater the rear of the Isthmus defences or upon the Defences. Steamer Point position could he easily opposed on the Munsoorie heights and at the Main Pass, it is desirable to prevent enemy’s ships taking up a position off Seera Island, or Marshag, from Seera Island, which they could easily destroy the town of Aden and the military establishments at that end of the peninsula. To prevent this, and to deny Front Bay and Holent Bay to an enemy, two 9-inch M.L.B. guns and two 32-pdr. S.B. guns have been mounted on the plateau on Seera Island referred to by Sir W. Jervois and in the War Office Memorandum. these, three 10-inch M.L.B. guns. . Tw0 g uns are proposed on El Erigh at the Rag El right extremity of the isthmus lines. These Erigh. would not only assist in the defence of Front Bay, hut would also bring a fire to bear over the isthmus, and flank the long extent of beach on the eastern side of it, on which a landing could be effected in perfectly calm weather during the north-east monsoon. The two 9-inch M.L.B. guns proposed to he moved from Seera Island might he placed in this work. Work Armament Cost. £ - 1,000 - 11,000 Total - £12,000 Garrison.

Ships can at present lie in Fisherman s Bay, where there is deep water close to the shore, unseen from any batteries, and could throw shells into the town and canton ments from a distance of only 2,000 yards ; and if it be considered necessary to keep ships at a distance from Seera Island and Holcut Bay, it would seem equally desirable to prevent them manoeuvring in Fisherman’s Bay. 1 J For this purpose, Sir W. Jervois recommended mortars placed under the southern 250 feet above the sea, three range, under cover of the work on Seera Island; but 9-inch M.L.R. guns. it would, I submit, be far preferable to place, as pro posed by General Tremenheere’s Committee, a battery to mount, say, three 9-inch M.L.B. guns on the Marshag promontory, somewhere near the signal station. This work could be made perfectly secure at little cost. ^ It would certainly have the great disadvantage of being in an isolated and detached position, but if the establishments at the eastern end of Aden are to be made secure against destruction by bombardment, such a work is absolutely required. With a small barrack the work would probably be — about 15,000^. ^ The armament is already at Aden. To prevent a boat landing in Holcut Bay it is proposed to place a battery, on the shore level of Seera Island, in rear near the causeway, but it is worthy of consideration whether it would not be better to place a battery for light guns or machine guns on the opposite shore on the projecting point between the two bays.

Works ‘ ‘ £1 ’500 No armament is recommended for Hapier or Mansfield batteries, but the scarp of the southern rahge lines should be heightened where required, particularly at the western end or inner portion, and the communication across the old gaps in the lines should he improved and screened. With regard to the extensive lines and batteries on the Munsoorie heights and those from the Main Pass to the harrier gate near Jehhel Huddeed, these would prevent an enemy, if he succeeded in forcing the southern lines or the isthmus and Front Bay defences, from advancing on the main position at Steamer Point. Little requires to he done to them. The scarps, particularly between the Main Pass gate and the sally port near Darruh El Hash, should be made inaccessible, and a small cut made in front of the sally port. It would be well also to form loopholes in the eastern wall covering the steps of communication to Bell’s battery. This battery is open to musketry fire from a knoll on the right-hand side of the road leading to the Crater from the main gate, on which some houses have been built. Access to this knoll should be made impossible by scarping the cliff. On the Steamer Point side of the main gate a new roadway has been made, and two rocky ridges have been left from two to four hundred yards in front, behind which a musketry fire would render the lower battery on that side of the gateway untenable; they should be removed. As regards the armament of this portion of the defences :— At High Munsoorie, from which a distant fire can be obtained to seaward in front Three 80-pdr. M.L.R. guns, of Seera Island, and also a plunging fire into Front Bay, 596 feet above the sea. it is proposed to substitute heavier ordnance for the 32-pdr. S.B. guns now mounted there, and for the reasons stated by the Committee. As 80-pdr, M.L.B. converted guns are in India and not required there, guns of this nature would appear to be preferable. An 80-pdr. M.L.B. gun should also be placed at El Hosh to fire along the isthmus. At Bell’s battery, from which a fire can be directed to the eastward, flanking the Munsoorie range and commanding the road from the Crater to the Main Pass, and also to the westward along the shores of the bay towards “ Little Pass,” it is recommended that, instead of only one medium gun, as mentioned in the War Office Memorandum, four 64-pdr. M.L.B. guns should be placed there, firing in each direction. I agree with Sir W. Jervois in considering that a defensible gateway should be constructed on the eastern side of the Main Pass ; the best position for this can only be decided upon after an accurate contoured survey of the ground has been made, but it would appear to be near, and above a cut in the rock on the right-hand side going towards the Crater, and about 80 yards One 80-pdr.

As such a number of regular artillerymen could not at present be spared for the defences of Aden, it is for consideration whether, as there is no possibility of raising any force for military service on the spot, two batteries of Native Artillery should not be raised in India for service at Aden.

Colonel Crossman, C.M.G., R.E., to the Inspector-General of Fortifications, relative to the Defences of Perim. 0 . ^o- V4. London, ° ir » . 15th June 1882. In accordance with instructions contained in the telegram (copy attached) addressed to Brigadier-General Blair, Y.C., Political Resident at Aden, I embarked on hoard the Indian Government steamer “ Amberwitch ” on the 12th May last, accom panied by Lieutenant-Colonel Harcourt, R.A., commanding Royal Artillery, and Lieutenant-Colonel Matthew, R.E., Executive Engineer at Aden, and proceeded to the island of Perim. The features and character of the island are so fully described in the accompanying pamphlet, “ A Descriptive and Historical Account of the Island,” by Lieutenant J. H. King, of the Bombay Staff Corps, 1877, that it is unnecessary here to say anything further on that head. As regards the suitability of Perim as a naval station, Lieutenant-General Sir W. Jervois has set forth in his report on the “Defences of Aden” (para. 61), dated Calcutta, 4th January 18 / 2, the reasons why, as a coaling and refitting station for the fleet, Aden should be selected in preference to Perim. Briefly stated, these are :— 1st. At Perim all water would have to be obtained by distillation, while at Aden a certain amount can be obtained in some years by rain water catch, and a ceitain amount can at all times also be obtained there from the neighbouring country. 2nd. Aden being connected with the mainland, supplies can be more easily obtained from the outside than can be the case of an island, communication with which is sometimes difficult. 3rd. The larger number of labourers that can be obtained for coaling purposes at Aden than at Perim, a small and barren island where the inhabitants must necessarily be few. But though not suited for a coaling or refitting station, the important position which Perim occupies at the mouth of the Red Sea, possessing as it does an excellent though small harbour, renders it most valuable as a station from which ships could command the Red Sea and close the straits of Bab-el-Mandeb. In 1799 the island was occupied in order to prevent the French coming down the Red Sea and attacking our Indian possessions (King’s pamphlet, p. 22). °Abandoned the same year, it was not till 1855, when the difficulties of navigation at the entrance to the Red Sea were occupying the attention of the Government, that the question of re-occupying the island and erecting a lighthouse on it was raised. In a despatch written in 1856, Sir Henry Leeke, then Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Navy, said,— “ If it is regarded in a military point of view, it will be clear that whoever are the “ possessors of the island of Perim have the key of the Red Sea.” ... “ A^ain, “ I would state that in the event of a ship canal being cut between Suez°and Alexandria, the value of such an island to the interests of trade is very apparent, “ and of the utmost importance to England and India.” ... . “As the resources “ (naval) of England in the Indian Ocean may at times be crippled, the footing of a “ powerful enemy on that island would add to the embarrassment of the Government, “ and cause much annoyance to the harbour of Aden, and would completely shut up “ the Red Seaand he concludes by saying, “ that the advantages of this island arc so “ many that it is well worth the consideration of the Government whether it is not “ better to regain possession of it, for if we do not, I strongly suspect others will.” In November 1856 Perim was re-occupied, a lighthouse was built and a small defensible barrack constructed, but nothing was done to secure the place against attack. ° Although, in the event of any great European war, the Suez Canal might be nominally closed to all combatants, there is every probability that if a power at war with England were to gain possession of Egypt, the canal would be used by that power for the service of her fleet if it were decided to carry on operations in Eastern seas. It is therefore now the more essential that (to use the words of Sir W. Jervois) tc the harbour should be so protected that it may be secure against seizure by an53 '”7 f “ enemy, and it is of great importance that any vessels of war we might have lying “ there at a time of hostilities should be protected against capture in the event of ft their being attacked by a superior force.” To attain these objects he proposes that a casemated fort with iron shields for ten 10-inch M.L.R. guns should be constructed on the low spit to the westward of the harbour, Ghee Dubba point. (See map attached to Lieutenant King’s pamphlet.) Appendix 2. It is, however, for consideration whether the best position for a battery to command the entrance to the harbour and its approaches, and also to fire upon the anchorage inside, is not on the eastern side Lee point, for the following reasons :— 1st. The site proposed for the battery at the western side is only 30 feet above the sea, while on the other the elevation is, at the level which would appear best suited for the construction of a work, about 90 feet. In the one case casemated cover would be required, in the other not, while the increased height would give considerable advantage to the battery on the eastern side of the entrance. 2nd. It will be seen on reference to the chart that the extreme range to the left of any gun firing to seaward from a fort placed on the spit will not extend beyond the line A, B, leaving an unseen space of about 200 yards in width of water over 6 fathoms deep between the south-eastern point of the island and False Bay, in which bay, though the upper part is shallow, there is good landing for boats, and it would be possible, if the main body of the garrison of the island were confined to the isolated land on the western side, for an enemy to land and, though certainly with great difficulty, to bring up guns under cover to command the harbour at short range. 3rd. If it should be considered necessary to protect the island against a force landed on the north shore, which will be treated of further on, the difficulty of keeping up communications between the portion of the garrison of the island required for that service and the men required to man the guns at the spit would be very great; while if the work were on the other side of the harbour the communi cations between all the forces on the island would be short and direct. It may be remarked, however, that a battery on the spit would have a more extended range to the westward, and so better cover the water off the harbour in which ships could manoeuvre to shell vessels lying inside, but in such a case they could be moved nearer the northern part of the harbour and there moored. For the defence of the harbour, therefore, against an attack by sea, I would recommend that a battery be placed on Lee Point, on Lee Point a contour running at an elevation of about 90 feet above Batter 7- the sea level, and between the two beacons, to mount six 10*4-incli B. L. B. guns firing over the approaches and entrance to the harbour, with two 64-pdr. M. L. R. guns on the left to oppose any attempt at a boat landing in False Bay, and two 64-pdr. M.L.R. guns on the right to flank a line of submarine mines which should be placed across the entrance; the four lighter guns to be placed on a lower level than the main battery. The battery could be made secure against a land attack by scarping the rock to the seaward, which could easily be rendered inaccessible, and by cutting off the rear by a flanked ditch, the interior of the battery The construction of the battery would be very costly; the whole surface of the “ hilly portions of the island is covered with a close mass of basaltic boulders of every ' size and shape (varying roughly from 8 to as much as 125 cubic feet), but mostly “ rounded. Underneath these lies a layer of volcanic soil from two to six feet in “ depth.”—(King, page 15.) I doubt much if the soil here mentioned would be of any use whatever in forming parapets, it would not bind, nor would grass grow upon it; in many places too, there is nothing but loose sand under the boulders, so that it would probably be on the whole least expensive to provide for the main guns being mounted behind an iron parapet. The whole of the ground on the site of the battery, and for some distance in front and also in rear, would have to be cleared from boulders. If this were not done, the works would be untenable from splinters unless the guns were under casemates. 7193. O Six 10 • 4-inch B. L. R. guns. Four 64-pdr. M. L. R. guns.

Fair building stone and lime from coral can be obtained on the island but the expense of labour, winch would have to be brought from Aden, would be very high * the cost of removing the boulders and preparing the site can only be very roughly estimated, but for such a battery, as proposed, with a guard room, in addition to bar rack accommodation outside for 150 men required for the guns, the expense (including armament, 29,200/.) could not be estimated safely at less than 70,000/. When plans, however, have been drawn out, it will be possible to estimate the cost very nearly by means of the details prepared by the Simla Defence Committee for proposed works at Aden. The above provides for the defence of Perim against an attack by sea; but, in the contingency, alluded to above, of an enemy being able to utilize the Suez Canal for the passage of his ships into the Red Sea, Perim might be attacked not onlv bv shins but by a force landed on the island. ^ ' * Any landing in force would not probably be attempted on the southern shore as the battery on Lee Point would render this an operation of extreme difficulty Unless a strong north-west wind were blowing, which may occur at anv time between October and June, sometimes continuing for several days, the best landing place is on the long extent of sandy beach (called Turtle Beach) on the northern side of the island To oppose this, the best position to be occupied is near the lighthouse, where cover could be thrown up for light field or machine guns to sweep the beach and low level sandy ground between it and the hills. After leaving the flat, the approach would be over boulders which would prevent anything but infantry advancing in very irregular order, so preventing any sudden rush in force. s c A blockhouse or enclosure, formed of the boulders themselves, with very little clearing in front, would be sufficient, if placed on the projecting point to the westward of the lighthouse, to prevent any landing on the northern shore. A few pits or slight screen for musketry fire might also be thrown up to the east of the lighthouse to oppose any advance from the men thrown ashore in Shelter Bay. Though, on the western side of the island, it might be possible for a few men to land on small sandy patches to the north and south of Shark point, any land operations carried on from that direction would be so difficult from the great extent of rocky ground that would lia^e to be passed over that it is not considered necessarv to recom mend any advanced post on that side of the island. A small defensible barrack is constructed round the lighthouse. This it would be well to retain and improve by loopholing the walls and giving somewhat more efficient flank defence; it would then serve as keep to the advanced positions recommended above. This barrack is only capable of accommodating 50 men, but for the defence of this part of the island it is considered that 100 would be required, as a guard would be wanted for the protection of the water condensing apparatus in Fisherman’s Bay. For the land defences, two light field guns and two machine guns should he supplied. Though for a peace garrison the number now stationed on the island is sufficient, in time of war the number required would be :— Artillery:— To man the guns in battery, 130, of whom 40 might be infantry. To man field and machine guns, 20, of whom 10 might be infantry. Total Artillery—1 battery, 100 men. Engineers -Submarine mines, 20 men. Infantry:— For guns Lighthouse position Flagstaff 50 men. 100 „ 80 „ Total infantry 230 _ There is already accommodation for 50 men, and, as a guard room should be pro vided in the battery, which in time of war would contain, say, 50 men, and also a guard house at Fisherman’s Bay, to contain 20 men, barracks would be required for 230 men. Ihe best position for these barracks would appear to be at the point C, or Flagstaff hill, the highest ground in the island, 214 feet above the sea, about 800 yards from the lighthouse, and 1,600 yards from the proposed battery at Lee Point. I -1 &gt; r dThey should be placed in an enclosure, secure against a coup-de-main, so as to guarjh against any approach fron? Azalea Bay. Their cost, as they would be prin cipally intended for Native troops, should not exceed 12,000/. The existing track passing by this point from the lighthouse to Lee Point should Roada. be widened and made available for the movement of light field guns. A road should also be made from the barracks to the point between Pisherman’s Bay and James’s Bay. To summarize. It is proposed to construct a battery on Lee Point to mount six Summary# 10‘4-inch B.L.B. guns behind shields, and four 64-pdr. M.L.B, guns. To improve defences of defensible barrack and lighthouse. To form emplacement for light guns and machine guns, at the point D, west of the lighthouse. To form rifle pits and musketry screens at E, to the east of the lighthouse. To build a barrack for 230 men, surrounded by a defensible enclosure, on Flagstaff Hill (C). To improve the roads running from lighthouse by Flagstaff to Lee Point, and from Old Fort to lighthouse and to Flagstaff Hill. To build guard house near ruins of old fort for protection of condensing apparatus. The cost estimated approximately is :— £ Battery ------ Armament (including two light field guns, and machine guns) - Submarine mines - - - Barracks (for 230 men) - Improvement to defensible barrack Guard room (Fisherman’s Bay) - Improvement of roads - - 40,000 two - 30,000 - 4,000 - 12,000 500 500 - 1,000 £88,000 Garrison :— Artillery - Engineers - Infantry ----- - 100 men. - 20 „ - 230 „ Total - - - - - 350 „ In conclusion, I would mention that it would be very advisable to have the coral patches in the centre of the northern part of the harbour removed, and proper landing places made in Fisherman’s and James’s Bays. Enclosed are two pen and ink sketches* by Lieutenant W. Bussell, B.E., one showing the entrance to the harbour from the point H, the other of the interior of the harbour from the point K, at the head of Murray Bay. I have, &amp;c., (Signed) W.
