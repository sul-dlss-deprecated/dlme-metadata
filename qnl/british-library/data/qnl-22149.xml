Negotiations with I emen. ) Subsequently an impression had grown up that this referred to the despatch of Sheykh Hamad Suleyman and Khalid Bey al Qarqani, and that they had been held up by the revolt m ’Asfr. 3. Fuad Bey said there had been no question of sending Sheykh Hamad and hiscompamon to San a Their destination had always been Asfr, where it was at first intended that they should investigate the situation and where they remained after the outbreak of the revolt. They were now with the punitive3 3 forces. The King had sent quite independently another officer direct from Riyadh to San’a in the person of Muhammad Ibn Dhawi, a “ clerk ” in his diwan. The object was to discuss in a friendly spirit various outstanding matters, among which Fuad Bey specifically mentioned frontier delimitation. 4. Fuad Bey said that Muhammad ibn Dhawi was still in San’a. He pro mised spontaneously to inquire about the course of the negotiations and to let me know the result of his inquiries. When thanking him, I repeated that my interest in the matter was general and that while I should be glad to have any further information, I did not wish to be importunate. All that really concerned us was to know that the rulers concerned were in good relations, as we were all for peace in Arabia. Fuad Bey made the remarks which are now usual about the excellent attitude of the Imam in regard to the ’Asfr revolt, of which he disapproved. I said that all my own information supported the belief that the Imam had no desire to embroil himself. 5.

The Vice-Consul was confident that it was still going on but on a very small scale. He believes seldom more than 3 slaves at a time are shipped and often only one. Small Sambouks are used and adults are not as a rule dealt in. The Chef de Cabinet in the course of conversation only reiterated what French officials have been saying for years, i.e., that slave traffic through French Somaliland is non-existent ; that the coast is tob well patrblled. I ascertained that the coast from the head of the Gulf of Tajura to Raheta a distance of 115 miles was in charge of a District Commissioner with a small party of native camelry stationed at Obak so it is doubtful if the patrol is in any way effective. The District Commissioner is the only European official employed in this region. There seems little prospect of combating the trade until the French take an active interest. Mr. Lowe assured me that there would be no difficulty in the French authorities obtaining information if they really wanted to. + ******* 6. Ras-al-Ara. * ***** In the evening of 13th November, having received information of a rising in Asir by the Idrissi against Ibn Sa’ud’s suzerainty, proceeded to Aden to Store and fuel. ******** i - g# ******* On reaching the vicinity of Hodeida it was realised that it would be im practicable to land so course was shaped for Kamatran arriving at 1600. Kamaran.—The Administrator, Captain Wickham, visited the ship shortly afterwards. He had no fresh information regarding affairs in Asir except a rumour that the attack by the Idflssians on Gizan had failed for the present. 9. On 18th November, Captain Wickham received a personal letter from Seyyid Abid al Idrissi (nephew of the Idrissi) announcing a revolt due to Sa’udi oppression, and the restoration of the Idrissi’s authority in Asir. Abid en quired as to the attitude of the British Government and under what conditions they would contemplate an agreement. The purport of this letter was passed to the Chief Commissioner, Aden. About the same time unconfirmed reports announced the capture of Sabia and Gizan by the Idrissians. On 20th November information was received that Ibn Sa’ud had re-captnred Gizan, having sent troops by sea and attacked under cover of darkness. 10. Hodeida .—The weather having moderated I sailed early on 21st Novem ber for HODEIDA and arrived at 1115 The Political Clerk, Mohamed Saleh Jaffar came on board on arrival and a salute was fired on ascertaining that the local authorities were prepared to return it.5 11. Saleh Jaffer informed me that the Governor Saif-al-Islam al Hussein, fourth son of the Iman, was sick and that the Assistant Governor, Kazi Ali Bin Hussein Al-Amri would receive my call. I landed at 1600 and was met by a guard and band about 120 strong and several of the principal Officials of the district were presented to me before proceeding to the Government Offices. My reception was most friendly and it was obvious that a visit from one of H. M. Ships was considered an honour. The Governor sent a message saying how sorry he was not to be able to meet me. He invited me to send a telegram to the Iman which I did expressing pleasure at the opportunity of visiting HOD El DA and appreciation of my reception. The Iman replied thanking me for my message and welcoming our arrival. Later in the day a dhow came off bringing gifts from the Governor con sisting of 2 oxen, 3 sheep, chickens, eggs, coffee, and bananas. In return I sent some cases of tinned fruits, jams and syrup, which it is believed are appreciated. 12. The following morning the Acting Governor accompanied by Saleh Jaffer and three members of Al Hussein’s Staff returned my call. He was showm over the ship in which he displayed great interest and expressed a hope that we would pay more frequent visits to HODE1DA. As he was unquestion ably acting in the place of the Governor who was sick, I gave him a salute^ of 15 guns on leaving, this being the number accorded by British and Italian warships on previous visits. From information obtained from the Political Clerk, it appears that the Iman, while secretly encouraging the revolt in ASIR, is not giving any open support. Proceeded at 1130 and returned to K AM ARAN. 13. Kamaran ,—On 21st November about 95 refugees including 50 male adults, arrived, mostly from GIZAN ; amongst these were Seyyid Abid, accompanied by his cousin Seyyid Hussein and a party of 30. Abid had hoped to receive an answer to his letter with request for an agreement and handed a further letter to the Administrator with definite suggestions including pro posals for a grant by the Idrissi of Oil and Salt concessions in FARTS AN and GTZAN respectively'in return for help. The text of this letter was passed to ADEN. 14. Abid accompanied by Hussein called on me on 23rd November. He was in formed beforehand that I could in no way discuss the rights and wrongs of the political situation ; an arrangement to which he endeavoured to comply but w r as unable to resist, expressing bitter feelings against Ibn Sa’ud stating also that all the Idrissians needed were arms and ammunition and that they were more afraid of the Iman than Ibn Sa’ud. In the course of conversation he mentioned having visited H. M. S* “ ODIN ” some years ago at GIZAN and asked why no British Warships came there now. •V Abid is a pleasant, plausible fellow with a keen sense of humour and his troubles do not appear to weigh heavily upon him. Hussein had little to say. 15. On 24th November Abid was informed by the Administrator that he must leave the island and he sailed for MASSAWA on the 25th. Later it was reported that, on encountering some Idrissian dhows and hearing that the Idrissi was about to start a new offensive, he transhipped, sent his family on to MASSAWA, and landed at MADAYA (about half way between GIZAN and MEDI). Confirmation of this has been received and it is since reported that SABI A and the Wells at GIZAN have been recovered by the Idyissians. The Sa’udi troops in GIZAN are obtaining water from FARISAN. A wounded Saudi soldier who arrived with two others from GIZAN on 23rd November is being treated in the hospital. Proceeded on patrol w'est of the reef area at 1600 on 30th November. #*#*#« #* Lc62FD6 ( 7 ) {Received on 11th March 1 ( J33, with Political Secretary's, letter No. 8, dated ,23rd February 1933.)

On 2nd December at 0900, I closed JEBEL TIER with the intention of sending some books and papers but the swell did not permit landing. Proceeded to KAMARAN by the North passage and arrived at 1800. 3. Kamaran .—There was no information to show any change in the situa tion in ASIR. All refugees had been ordered to leave the island and were clear by 7th December. Accordingly I proceeded with the programme originally projected having ascertained that the Chief Commissioner Aden concurred that the presence of the ship at KAMARAN was no longer necessary. FARISAN ISLANDS were deliberately avoided in order that there should be no impression of British countenance or support of the revolt. I had consulted with the Chief Commisioner when at ADEN with regard to the policy it was desirable to adopt. *** ***•• 7. Massawa— It was ascertained that 60 refugees from GIZAN FARISAN and KAMARAN arrived at MASSAWA on 6th December. *# * * * * * * 13. Mukalla .—MUKALLA was reached on the morning of 18th December, a few dhows being boarded on passage. Calls we're exchanged with the Wazir, Seyyid Bubakar Husein, representing the Sultan who was absent in India. We had a friendly reception and were entertained to luncheon in the Sultan’s Palace. Motor cars were placed at our disposal for a duck shooting expedition. 14. Bir Ali .—Sailed at 1835 on 19th December and arived on the follow ing morning at BTR ALI. There was a strong easterly wind blowing and landing was difficult. Visits were exchanged with the Representative of the Sultan who was absent in ADEN. The Representative complained that his neighbours from BAL HAF (20 miles west of BIR ALI) had arested two dhows and imprisoned six of his villagers and asked if I could do anything to procure their release. It was a coincidence that when at ADEN the Chief Commissioner had asked me to visit BAL HAF as well as BIR ALI in order to avoid jealously as a good deal of friction existed between the two tribes.8 15. Bal Haf. —I reported the complaint to the Chief Commissioner and pro ceeded to BAL HAF. The Sultan was friendly but somewhat deaf and loqua cious. 1 believe he felt that the ship had been sent specially to BAL HAF on account of the existing circumstances. The result of my proceedings are reported in Enclosure No. 2 herewith. At both places we were well received. Gifts of honey, fruit and a goat were presented during our visits to MUKALA.

I beg to report that I interviewed the Sultan of Bal Haf this morning and informed him of your message 1956 of 20th December, having ascertained previously that the report from BIR ALI was correct. 2. On request I gave him written instructions to release the dhows and their crews*. He then stated that the crews had already been released shortly before the arrival of H. M. S. “ HASTINGS ” (1600—20th December), but that the dhows were still at BAL HAF. After some discussion he promised to send a message to BIR ALI forthwith requesting that men should be sent to take them away, 3. It apears that the dhows were detained as a reprisal for the theft of four canoes from the fishing village of JILLAA. The canoes were not actually stolen by the Bir Ali but by a Bedouin tribe (Ahl-el-Adin from AL-HAMIA). Bal Haf stated that this* Bedouin tribe were close friends of the Bir Ali and that the latter had incited and paid the former to commit the crime. 4. He also stated that he is always ready to obey the instructions of the British Government but that hfs tribe are very indignant at the loss of the canoes and he fears there may be trouble if the canoes are not returned or compensation paid.

The article is chiefly of interest as making express mention of noii-Moslems as prospective concessionaires, in open contrast to the policy which appeared to ^ ^hemplation in 1931, when, for instance, it was definitely recommended by the ‘ National Conference ’’ convened in June of that year that concessions should be granted to Moslems only. 3. neia, Tiioiii I tie policy ot confining concessions to Moslems held the perhaps more m theory than as a genuine factor in Ibn Sa’ud’s schemes for economic devo.opment, until recently.

I take this opportunity of stating that the effective arrangements of the Sa’udi Government for dealing with foreign affairs remain otherwise unchanged. The Amir Feysal continues to be titular Minister and to play no apparent active role. Fuad Bey Hamza continues to be the only person with whom business can usefully be discussed.

Enclosure 2 to Serial No. (13). Letter from His Majesty’s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. In paragraph 32 of the Jedda Report for March (File No. 81-N/33), enclosed in my despatch No. 102 of April 7,1 mentioned that Ibn Sa’ud had given a dinner to notable pilgrims on the evening of March 31. As you are aware, this is now a regular feature of each year’s pilgrimage season. On the present occasion, the Ring entertained some hundreds of guests of various nationalities, including several Indians. I understand from my Indian Vice-Consul that the attention shown both to Shia and to Indian pilgnms has been a feature of this year’s pilg image. In the case of the Indians the King and the Minister of Finance, who is largely responsible for dispensing such attention had the advantage of the presence of Jemal Pasha Ghazzi, who has been conducting since last year an intensive pro- pilgrimage campaign in India and was able to make r-ay with the intimacy he had established there with various participents in this year’s Haj. 2. It is the King’s custom to speak at g r eat lengt h at these annual banquets. The published version of his address on the pr«--sent occasion occupied a page and a half of the Umm-al-Qura of April 6. I enclose a short summary prepared in the L( g Mion. 3. The King preached from his usual text, the nc&gt; d lor unity in Islam but he seems to have restrained almost entirely the tendency which he has sometimes shown in the past to give offence by his utterances regarding people who do not share his views. I understand that the published version of his speech represents the original pretty accurately, although the actual language used in certain pas sages may have been more emphatic. I have heard only one definite suggestion of any important omission. According to m}^ Persian colleague rhe King gave as one of the reasons who he could not aspire to the Caliphate the fa t that so many Moslem countries are under alien denomination. He is said to have included in the number Egypt as being under the thumb of Great Britain. If he really said this, it cannot have been pleasing to all his Egyptian hearers, though it might gratify some of them. 4.

Summary of the Speech delivered by His Majesty King 'Abdul Aziz ibn Sa’ud at the banquet given on the 31st March 1933 at the Royal Palace at Mecca. As published in the Mecca No. 434 of the 11th Dhud Hijja 1351 (April 6, 1933). The Arab people, His Majesty said, enjoy one great blessing from God in the teachings of the Prophet, which have descended on them like the fertilizing rain on the earth and have been the means by which they have spread their influence over vast territories. All Muslims were indebted to that great Teacher for the good that they had ; and if they would but adhere to the commands of God, as given in the Quran and the sacred writings, they would be successful and united, but if they set aside these commands they would become separated and degraded. And this, the King went on, is what is happening now; and he drew a picture of the sad condition of the Muslim world in general and the Arab people in particular at the present time. Some people imagine, he said, that the only remedy for this state is for Muslims to adopt European civilisation ; but this was not true, for the teachings of the Quran guarantee prosperity, unity and happiness to those who follow them, because they make no differentiation between King and commoner, save in respect of piety alone. Nor were foreigners alone to blame for all the calamities which had overtaken Islam, for amongst Muslims themselves they found some who were misguided and who were willing to aid them to work against Islam. “ I am the Herald of Islam ”, the King concluded. He was an Arab Muslim who served Islam and who worked for the spread of Islam and for Muslim unity ; and he was prepared to sacrifice himself and his family in the defence of Islam. He did not aim to be a chief of earth ; of greatest importance to him was to make God’s word supreme, and in pursuit of this he cared for no difficulties. Many had opposed him since he first put forward this aim but had been vanquished. What did they want of him ? His actions were clear ; he followed the Way. It had been said that he claimed to be Khalif over all Islam. He made no such claim. A Khalif must enforce the commands of the Islamic religion over the whole world of Islam, and this was possible in the time of the Khalifat ; but was there a man who could so do at the present time ? It was clearly impossible and all he himself desired was unity and co-operation among Muslims. Behind him were'more than 400,000 warriors ; if he wept they wept; if he re joiced they rejoiced and if he ecommanded they obeyed his commands. These were the Troops of Unity, the brethren of all who obeyed God, ready to fight for God and expecting nothing from it except to satisfy God ; and this was the force destined to confirm the Religious Law and Islam throughout the territories over which he ruled.

Letter from His Majesty’s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 149 (1330/28/38), dated the 15th May 1633. I have dealt in recent reports with two separate but inter-related subjects connected with the financial situation in this country, viz., {a) The proposed estab lishment of a National Bank under the auspices of the ex-Khedive (see correspon dence ending with my despatch No. 101 of April 5th); and (b) The position in regard to the payment of the Sa’udi Government’s debts, with special reference to debts in which His Majesty’s Government have a direct interest and to the use of drafts on customs to pay commercial debts (see correspondence ending with my despatch No. 123 of April 21st). 2. Both of these subjects have been brought into the lime-light as a result more particularly of the article by Mr. Philby in the Times of April 26th. So far as official circles in the Hejaz are concerned, silence had for some time brooded over the Bank proposal. They have, I think, been a little perturbed at receiving no news as to the progress made by 'Abdul Hamid Shedid since he left on April 10thwith his concession in his pocket and, I am now assured, a small sum of cash down for expenses. This has doubtless made Ibn Sa’ud and his entourage all ^ or , e sensitive regarding two misconstructions alleged to have been placed on Mr. Tmibj s article in the translation published by the Abram newspaper of Cairo, the A hr am version had, according to people here, laid the Saudi Government open to the accusations of having sold themselves to a group intending to create not a State Bank, as Mr. Philby called it, but an “ international bank and of having mortgaged their customs revenue. Both accusations were repudiated m a long an indignent leading article in the Umm-al-Qura of May 12th and the second was categorically denied in an official communique of May 11th, published m the sarne issue of the Umm-al Qura. I enclose a treanslation of the communique, ihe Umm-al-Qura also published a letter from Mr. Philby correcting the misconstruc tions placed on his article. 3. The Umm-al-Qura leader is not worth reproducing as it is mostly diatribe- The most interesting points in it are the stress laid on the importance of the distinc tion between a state bank and an international bank, an explanation of the methods hitherto used to pay off debts and the use of drafts on customs in that connexion and a rather weaker attempt to rebut the suggestion that the adoption of the Bank proposal means countenancing usury. It is claimed that the Government have paid off more than half their debts in the last two years and the hope is expressed that, if some of the economic projects now in view materialise, the remainder will be settled shortly. . T 4. All this may amount to little more than a passing storm in a teacup but 1 have though it worth recording as a sidelight on a curiously uncertain situation in regard to the proposed bank and the hopes that hang so largely, though not exclu sively, on the prospect of its being started. 5. I am sending copies of this despatch and enclosure to the Department of Overseas Trade, the Government of India, His Majesty’s High Commissioner for Egypt and to the High Commissioner for Transjordan. Enclosure 3 to Serial No. (18). Extract from the “ Umm-al-Qura ” of May 12th, 1933. Official Communique, dated 16th Muharram 1352 (11th May 1933).

The Govern ment confirm what they have already promulgated that they had not contracted any loan whatsoever and that they had not mortgaged the revenue of the Customs at ail. (19) (Received on 11th June 1933 with Political Secretary’s letter No. 21, dated the 25th May 1933.) Letter from the Colonial Office, to the India Office, No. 17963/33, dated the 17th May 1933. I am directed by Secretary Sir Philip Ounliffe-Lister to transmit to you, to be laid before Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare, a copy of a despatc h from the Resident at Aden regarding the succession to the Sultanate of Lahej. 2. Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister agrees with the Resident’s views as to the atti tude which he should adopt in the matter, and, subject to Sir Samuel Hoare’s concurrence, he proposes to approve the course of action suggested m paragraph 13 of the Resident’s despatch. 3. A similar letter is being .sent to the Foreign Office and Air Ministry. Enclosure to Serial No. (19). Despatch from the Resident, Aden, to the Colonial Office, No. 65, dated the 22nd March 1933. I have the honour to refer to the recent political events in Lahej in connection with the succession to the Sultanate, that have been reported briefly in Political Intelligence Summary, paragraph 2260, et seq. (File No. 26-N/33).15 2. For very many years the custom in regard to the succession to the Sultanate of Lahej has been that after the death of the reigning Sultan his successor is elected by certain tribal Aqils and Qadhis, who are entitled to do so. The election is then reported to the Resident, and the new Sultan is accorded official recognition unless there are very cogent reasons to withhold it. The customary procedure thus briefly outlined is common to the whole Protectorate. 3. There are five branches of the family of the Sultan of Lahej, in two of which (the Ali Muhsin and the Fadhl Muhsin)the succession has been confined, with fairly regular alternation, since the death of the common ancestor, Sultan Muhsin Fadhl, in 1847. 4. On the acceesion of the present Sultan, His Highness Sir Abdul Karim bin Fadhl Ali Muhsin, in 1915, the heads of the Fadhl Muhsin refused to recognise him. In 1919 a rapproachment was brought about between this dissident element and His Highness, but the animosity still smouldered, and in 1930 it broke out in the form of a conspiracy, instigated by these persons during the absence of His Highness in India, to remove him and to arrange the succession of a member of the badhl Muhsin branch. The conspiracy was discovered ; and, on his return from India, the Sultan took such action against the ringleaders as he hoped would put an end to overt opposition to his authority. 5. In consequence of this incident His Highness made tentative proposals to the Residency that he should ensure continuity in the succession by proclaiming his eldest son, Sultan Fahdl bin Abdul Karim as heir-apparent. My predecessor advised him not to do so and the matter appeared to have dropped. 6. On the 12th February of this year, however, His Highness informed me that at the instance of the electors, and with his permission, an election had been held, that his eldest son Sultan Fadhl bin Abdul Karim had been unanimously elected as his successor, and that he had accordingly nominated him as such. 7. His Highness had caused or allowed these steps to be taken without prior reference to the Residency, and I was about to express my objections to this proce dure when the report was received of the attempted assassination of Sultan Fadhl at the hands or at the instigation of the leaders of the Fadhl Mohsin branch {vide Political Intelligence Summary, paragraph 2260, et seq). This new circumstances made it impolitic for me to advise His Highness to retract his recognition of Sultan Fadhl his successor, for the reason that His Highness’s acquiescence in my request might seem to be a concession to violence ; and I therefore considered it advisable to confine myself at the moment to asking His Highness for an explanation of the reasons that had prompted him in departing from the customary practice in regard to the succession. 8. In reply His Highness explained that his action was designed to guard against the strife and dissension that are the usual consequences of disputes regarding the succession on the death of a tribal Chief. He argued that the Sultanate of Lahej has come to be recognised as the centre of arbitration between tribal Chiefs over a wide area, and that it is therefore particularly necessary that continuous security and order should be ensured in it; and he pointed out that continuance of the custom hitherto existing in regard to the succession tended towards multiplicity of claimants and complexity of issue. He further contended that the electors, who are the custodians of custom, had themselves initiated the proposal of an election during his life-time, and that he had acceded to their wishes in the best interests of his State. 9. I have told His Highness that I am reporting what has occurred and the explanation that he has given me to His Majesty's Government. 10. A settlement of the succession during the life-time of the present Sultan will have considerable advantages if it is loyally observed when his death occurs. Since 1918 and especially during the past five years, the Sultanate of Lahej has assumed an immportance unknown before the Great AVar, principally due to the personality of the present Sultan and to his advisers and assistants from his own branch of the family. And the very close contact that has been established between His Highness and the Residency in the consideration of all major matters of general importance in the Protectorate render continuity of succession (and consequently of policy), at Lahej, very desirable. MC364FDfci 16 11. In view, however, of the uncertainty that must, in the nature of Arab tribal polity, still exist as to the actual accession of an heir-apparent on the death of a ruling Chief, I consider that official recognition of a pre-elected successor would seldom be effective, and ought not to be accorded. 12. While, therefore, I am sympathetic towards the efforts of the Sultan of Lahej to protect the admirable results of his organisation and industry in Lahej from disintegration at the hands of a less able, and possibly hostile, successor who might be elected from another branch of the family, after his death, I do not recommend any departure, on our part, from the existing procedure in regard to succession. 13. I propose, therefore, subject to your approval, to limit myself to informing His Highness that the election has been noted, but that formal recognistion of his successor must be deferred until the latter’s actual accession to the Sultanate ; and I intend to avoid the use of any expression that would imply a guarantee by His Majesty’s Government of the arrangement that has been made.

I am submitting this memorandum to my higher authorities here, but do not yet know whether it will be approved. I am sending copies of the enclosed revised draft to Parkinson at the Colonial Office, and, at his suggestion, to Peirse at the Air Ministry, with the necessary explanations.Enclosure to Serial No. (22). Attitude of His Majesty's Government towards the question of Arab Unity. 1. The phrase &lt;£ Arab Unity ” is an extremely vague one, which has been used in many different senses. 2. It is generally most in evidence on such occasions as Arab or Moslem congresses, and was freely bandied about during the Moslem Congress at Jeruselem in the autumn of 1931. On such occasions it is generally used extremely loosely as a popular rallying cry against either “ Western Imperial ism ” or the Zionist movement; but in actual fact it seldom amounts to much more than a rather undigested idea of co-operation between Arabic speaking people in matters of education and propaganda, but to some extent also in such politico-religious questions as that of the Hejaz railway, the future of the Holy Places, etc. Arab unity in this sense is something rather akin to pan- Arabism, and appears to have no more practical significance than the rather shadowy pan-Islamic movement, of which so much was heard some ten or twenty years ago. 3. From the political and practical point of view, “ Arab unity ” should mean the union, either in a single State or in a confederation of autonomous States, of all former Ottoman territories, south of present-day Turkey, which have a predomi nantly Arab population. This would to some extent limit the application of the idea to the north-western half of Arabia—^.e., to the Arabic speaking territo ries north-west of a line drawn from the middle of the Persian Gulf to the southern end of the Red Sea. It is in fact only to this area that the idea can be regarded as properly applicable, and it is therefore mainly from this point of view that the question is discussed in the present memorandum. But attempts may well be made to extend the idea of Arab unity to the Persian Gulf states and south-eastern Arabia. It is thus not possible to consider the problem without touching on its possible relation to these areas also. 4. The idea of Arab unity, as applied to the former Ottoman territories, i.e., to the Arabic speaking areas north-west of the line mentioned in the preceding paragraph, was the ultimate aim of the Arab Revolt during the War, and was the ideal for which the Hashimites, under Hussein and Colonel Lawrence, strove during the war and armistice periods. There is no doubt that the remaining members of the Hashimite family—Faisal, Ali and Abdullah have never aban doned this dream, although subsequent developments have rendered it wholly impracticable. 5. The most important of these subsequent developments, from the purely Arabian point of view, has been the rise to power of Ibn Saud, and his conquest of the greater part of the Arabian peninsula, including the former Kingdom of the Hejaz. The dynastic rivalry between the Hashimites and the Saudis renders it almost inconceivable that there could be any close or organic combi nation between the territories respectively ruled by them. It is true that King Feisal of Iraq has come to terms with King Ibn Saud and is now in friendly re lations with Saudi Arabia, and that we are working hard—with at last a*^ fair hope of success—to secure a similar rapprohment between Ibn Saud and the Amir Abdullah of Transjordan. But the rivalry between the two family systems is still a basic factor in the situation, and unless one group were virtually to disappear, there seems no prospect whatever of any effective combination of the territories at present ruled by Ibn Saud (i.e., the greater part of the Arabian peninsula, including the former kingdom of the Hejaz), with those at present ruled by the Hashimites, (i.e., the independent Kingdom of Iraq and the mandated territory of Transjordan). While the Arabs are themselves divided into these two great groups, any talk of Arab political unity in the wider sense must be illusory. 6. It would, moreover, be impossible for His Majesty’s Government to support either of these groups against the other, since they are bound by special obliga tions to both. Apart from the support which the Hashimites gave to the allied cause during the Great War, King Feisal and the Amir Abdullah have in the past shown themselves to be well-disposed towards His Majesty’s Government. It is not necessary to enter into details, but two recent cases in which the Amir18 Abdullah has, by his co-operation, materially assisted His Majesty’s Government are the Druse rebellion of 1925, and the Pelestine disturbances of 1929. More over, His Majesty’s Government are bound to King Feisal of Iraq by the Anglo- Iraqi Treaty of Alliance of 1930, and have a special responsibility to support the Amir Abdullah’s regime which has been set up in Transjordan under their direct protection as mandatory. On the other hand His Majesty’s Government are bound by special ties to King Ibn Saud in Saudi Arabia. They have main tained friendly and indeed cordial relations with Ibn Saud ever since the conclusion of the Treaty of Jedda in 1927. King Ibn Saud has not only main tained and developed these friendly relations but has proved himself capable of establishing and maintaining a stable and ordered Government in Arabia. It is moreover important for His Majesty’s Government with their great Moslem interests in India and elsewhere, to remain on friendly terms with the ruler of the Holy Places of Islam. In these circumstances all that His Majesty’s Government can do is to attempt to hold the balance evenly between the Hashimites on the one hand and the Saudis on the other, and, while doing all in their power to pro mote friendly relations between the two, to refrain from any action which might lead to the predominance in Arabia of either house at the expense of the other. 7. Apart from this major difficulty, there are also other elements in Arabia proper which are unlikely to- be capable of combination in any unified system. The most important of these are the independent kingdom of the Yemen, whose ruler is short-sighted and quarrelsomy and on uncertain terms both with Ibn Suad and King Feisal, though he ostensibly has treaties of friendship with both ; and the various minor Arabian rulers, such as the Sheikhs of Koweit, Bahrain, Qatar and the Trucial Coast, who are extremely jealous of each other and of their own independence, and have never shown any sign of capacity for political co-operation. The Sultanate of Muscat and Oman and the Aden Protectorate need not for the moment be considered in this connexion. On the other hand if the protagonists of the political ideas of “ Arab unity ” were ever to succeed in translating their ideal into practice, it is probable that they would exercise strong pressure on the Sheikhdoms of the Persian Gulf and of Southern Arabia, and on the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman, to join in furthering their aim. Such Sheikhdoms as Koweit and Bahrain are in close touch with Iraq and Saudi Arabia, both commercially and politically. Moreover, all these States, including Muscat, maintain a fairly close link with Saudi Arabia through the annual pilgrimage to Mecca, which is attended by many members of their ruling families. The pilgrimage offers exceptional opportuni ties not only for religious and cultural, but also for political, propaganda; and if Mecca were at any time to become a political centre of a united Arabia, or of a great Arabian confederation, it is possible that the political ideal for which it would stand might exercise a considerable attraction over the Arab rulers of the South Arabian and the Persian Gulf States and stimulate them to a greater desire to co-operate with the leading States of Western Arabia at any rate from the negative point of view of combatting western political and cultural influence in the Middle East. 8. As regards the minor Arab States of the Persian Gulf, an im portant consideration is the fact that, save in the case of the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman (where, however, we exercise a dominating influ ence), the foreign relations of the rulers concerned are by treaty exclusively conduct ed by His Majesty’s Government and that His Majesty’s Government are bound by a series of treaties to give these States varying degree of protection against foreign aggression and to assist them to maintain their independence. Apart from these treaty obligations, it is a basic principle of the policy of His Majesty’s Govern ment in the Middle East that these states should not be absorbed by any of their powerful neighbours, but should remain as far as possible independent units under effective British control. The development of inter-imperial air comunications, both civil and military, has, in the last few years, given this well-established prin ciple a new importance. In the case of Koweit, both King Feisal of Iraq and King Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia have at various times shown signs of wishing to acquire a hold over this territory, which would be a useful acquisition to either. Both on treaty grounds, however, and on grounds of imperial policy, it is important to us that Koweit should not be absorbed by either Saudi Arabia or Iraq.. Similarly as re gards Bahrain, apart from our treaty obligations to protect the Sheikh against// 19 aggression, it would be definitely against British interests that the islands should be absorbed by either Saudi Arabia or Persia. King Ibn Saud has already, by Article 6 of the Treaty of Jedda, specifically recognised the special relations of His Majesty’s Government with the Arab States of the Persian Gulf and is not likely therefore to seek to annex Bahrain. Meanwhile it is one of our main objects in our negotiations with Persia to obtain a similar recognition by Persia of our special relations with Bahrain, etc., and the abandonment of the antiquated Persian claims both to Bahrain and to certain other Arab islands in the Gulf. In these circums tances it would clearly to impossible for His Majesty’s Government to acquiesce in the incorporation of any of the smaller independent Arab States whether in the •Persian Gulf or in Southern Arabia in a wider Arabian political combination. 9. Meanwhile in the north and west any project for Arab unity in any practical sense of the word must come into conflict with the mandatory system in the French Levant States and in Palestine, with all that that system implies. The French, even if they were prepared to agree, on certain conditions, to the emancipation of the State of Syria proper, have made it clear that they have no intention of relin quishing their hold on the predominantly Christian State of the Lebanon, or, for the present at any rate, on the curious non-Arab enclave of the Jebel Druse. His Majesty’s Government are equally precluded from allowing Palestine to be absorbed in any way in any kind of predominantly Arab union, if only in view of their deep commitment to the policy of the Jewish national home, quite apart from their obligations to the other non-Arab or non-Moslem Communities and interests in Palestine proper. 10. From the point of view of practical politics, therefore, the question of Arab unity resolves itself into the possibility of some kind of combination, providing for the inclusion of indigenous non-Arab elements such as the Assyrians, Kurds, etc., between Iraq, Transjordan and the State of Syria. 11. As regards Transjordan, the union or combination of which with Iraq would at first sight seem easiest, since Transjordan is at present a purely Arab State and since its ruler is the brother of King Faisel, an initial difficulty is presented by the fact that Transjordan is covered by the mandate for Palestine, of which it n technically forms on integral part. It would therefore be necessary, before any effective combination between Transjordan and Iraq could be brought about, that His Majesty’s Government should arrange for the release of Transjordan from the mandate. Transjordan does not, however, at present appear to fulfil any of the conditions which have been laid down by the League of Nations as justifying the release of a territory from the mandatory regime. Even if Transjordan did to some extent fulfil these conditions a factor which might militate against her liberation from the mandate is the possibility that there may at no distant date be a Jewish settlement in Transjordan. While there can be no question of extending to Trans jordan the articles of the Palestine mandate which relate to the establishment of the Jewish national home, the existence of a Jewish minority in Transjordan would certainly increase the difficulties in the way of bringing the mandatory regime in that territory to an end. 12. As regards the State of Syria, there is no doubt that the French are seriously contemplating the possibility of its emancipation, and that King Feisal of Iraq, and Arab nationalists generally, both in Iraq and in Syria itself, are considering the possibility of a union of Syria and Iraq, perhaps under the rulership of a single individual. There are, however, various difficulties and objections to such a project. 13. In the first place, the French are unlikely to release their hold on Syria completely. Even if Syria were to be released from the mandate, it is probable that the mandate would be replaced by a Franco-Syrian Treaty of Alliance on the lines of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930. The position would then be that the Syrian portion of the new State, or confederation, whether it took the form of a republic or of a monar chy, would be bound to France, and would remain under predominantly French political and cultural influence while the Iraqi portion would be bound to this country under the Anglo-Iraqi treaty of 1930 and would remain under predominantly British influence. This might well lead to a situation of international rivalry which would produce serious international complications. 14. Again, Syria is at present in a higher state of development than Iraq Although its people are perhaps less virile, its towns are larger and more flourishing, and its culture and civilisation are more advanced. In any case, it is a far more MC364FD20 agreeable country to live in. It is probable, therefore, that Iraqis would be increas ingly attracted to the Syrian towns of Damascus and Aleppo, and thus perhaps also to the even more definitely French district of the Lebanon or town of Beirut, and that Syrian—and thus French—influence would tend to estabhsh itself increas ingly in Iraq proper. The capital of the new State might even be moved to Damascus which is an infinitely pleasanter town than Bagdad, and as a result Franco-Syrian influence might spread eastwards until the whole character of Iraq and of the politi cal relationship between His Majesty’s Government and that country might be transformed. It is clear that the immediate interests of His Majesty’s Government, particularly in regard to the safety of inter-imperial communications, which have been so carefully protected by the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930, would suffer serious injury as the result of such a development. 15. The questions dealt with in paragraphs Nos. 12, 13 and 14 above were considered by the Ministerial Middle East sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence on November 17th, 1931, and the relevant conclusions then reached ran as follows :— (1) That the outcome most likely to be to the advantage of His Majesty’s Government would be the constitution of Syria as a republic with a Syrian as President; (2) That for a single individual to hold the crowns both of Syria and Iraq would be most undesirable, and would, in ay case, be likely to prove unworkable ; (3) That any attempt by King Feisal to transfer his crown from Iraq to Syria would be contrary to British interests. .16. Even were all these immediate dynastic and political obstacles to be surmounted, it is very doubtful whether real Arab unity could ever be achieved even between the major States such as Saudi Arabia, Iraq, etc., if only for purely geographical reasons. In actual fact, notwithstanding its apparent homogeneity and compactness, there is no geographical unity in Arabia. The northren countries, such as Iraq, Syria, Palstine and Transjordan, all differ widely from each other in configuration, soil, climante and general character. Southern Arabia, although it appears to possess a certain unity from a first glance at the map, can really more accurately be described as an archipelago of human settlements in a sea of desert, inhabited by tribes who are driven by the exigencies of desert life into becom ing, as it were, land pirates ceaselessly preying on each other. Any idea of unity or confederation based on the ordinary European conceptions which such words suggest is quite inapplicable to an area of this type. 17. But from the point of view of general international co-operation and under standing, of cultural development, and of economic prosperity, His Majestys &gt; Government can naturally only view with sympathy any movement which tends to bring the peoples of the Arabian countries into closer and more friendly relations with each other, provided, of course, that it is not incompatible with their special treaty relations and responsibilities towards certain of the States concerned. They have indeed always done whatever has been possible to this end. The improvement of the last few years in relations between Iraq and Saudi Arabia has been mainly due to the efforts of His Majesty’s Government, who brought about the reconciliation bet ween King Feisal and King Ibn Saud on in board H. M. S. “ Lupin ” in February 1930, His Majesty’s Government are now actively engaged in trying to bring about a similar improvement in relations between Saudi Arabia and Transjordan, and hope that these may lead to the conclusion of a treaty settlement, including treaties of friendship and bon visinage, between King Ibn Saud and the Amir Abdullah, corresponding to the treaty settlement concluded between Saudi Arabia and Iraq in April 1931. His Majesty’s Government have moreover always sought to further the close co-operation of the Arab countries in economic matters, and have suceeded in securing for Iraq and Transjordan, by suitable provisions in the relevant instru ments, the right to accord specially favourable tariff treatment to neighbouring Arab States, notwithstanding their most-favoured-nation obligations to other countries. 18. Should the question of the attitude of His Majesty’s Government towards the problem of Arab unity be raised in the course of King Feisal’s impending visit to this country, it is submitted that it should be explained that the general attitudeof His Majesty’s Government will be one of friendly sympathy towards any cons tructive proposals for peaceful co-opertion and for the development of close and friendly relations among the leading states of Arabia ; King Feisal could be left to explain in greater detail exactly what he has in mind ; but, since it is not possible for His Majesty’s Government, for the reasons explained above, and especially in paragraphs 6, 8 and 15, to support any policy designed to bring about the political unification of Arabia, it seems desirable that any suitable opportunity should be taken to discourage King Feisal from identifying himself with, or committing himself to, such a project. Such discouragement might, for instance, take the form of advising His Majesty, as Sir Francis Humphrys has already done, that he can best serve the Arab cause by concentrating his energies on the peaceful development of his own country’s resources and institutions, so that the Government of Iraq may serve as a model and a source of encouragement to other Arab states, 19. In any case Sir Francis Humphrys has suggested that it would be well to do whatever may be possible to discourage King Feisal from holding a Pan Arab Congress in Bagdad, as it has been proposed that he should do this autumn. While the arguments which may be used with King Feisal against the holding of a Congress must necessarily depend to some extent on the course which the discussion of this aspect of the question with him may take, the following considerations might perhaps usefully be brought to His Majesty’s notice. 20. In the first place is it clear that none of the causes which King Feisal may be presumed to have most at heart— e.g., the consolidation and international standing of Iraq or the future prospects of the Hashimite family in general—are likely to be furthered by the holding of an Arab or Moslem Congress either in Bagdad or elsewhere at the present time. The proceedings of the Congress, for which King Feisal could not escape a considerable measure of responsibility, could hardly fail to produce an adverse reaction at least on the French, and therefore not only prove internationally embarrassing but also render relations between Iraq and Syria more difficult. The opportunity of the Congress would moreover almost certainly be taken to raise in an acutely controversial form such embarrassing questions for the Hashimite family as that of the Amir Abdullah’s attitude towards the Jewish Settlement in Transjordan, his relations, both now and in the recent past, with King Ibn Saud, and his attitude towards certain Arab parties in Palestine itself, Moreover, the Congress would almost certainly, as in the case of the Jerusalem Congress of 1931, give an opportunity to zealots or mischief makers to make anti- foreign speeches which would lead to bitter resentment in foreign countries with Moslem interests, such as France and Italy ; it would offer a favourable opportunity for anti-Hashimite propaganda intrigue, and would inevitably tend to intensify the existing divisions in Arab opinion rather than to bring about a spirit of friendly and effective co-operation among Arab peoples. Some of these arguments have already been used orally with King Feisal by Sir Francis Humphrys last February and March, and King Feisal then stated that be was most anxious to avoid doing anything w T hich might have the effect of antagonising his neighbours or cause annoyance or embarrassment to His Majesty’s Government. There is reason to believe, however, that His Majesty has not yet completely abardoned the idea of a Congress and it is very desirable from every point of view that he should now be strongly urged to make up his mind against its being held at all.

Letter from His Majesty’s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 0.T.-24 (1548/1427/2), dated the 2nd June 1933. One of the stock projects for promoting the development of this country on modern lines is that of supplying the city of Mecca with electricity. 2. The Sa’Odi Minister of Finance who appears to be interested in this idea, was recently approached on the subject by a philanthropic Indian gentleman, Sheykh Muhammad Ibrahim Jawan Bakhsh, who is described as a leading merchant of Calcutta The Indian Vice-Consul reports that at an interview between them, at which he was present, Sheykh Muhammad Ibrahim expressed anxiety to secure the concession provided that he could feel assured that the capital sunk in the venture would be adequately safeguarded, a proviso which he considered would be amply met if, in case of dispute he were allowed to invoke the assistance ot the British authorities. Sheykh Abdullah Suleyman demurred to this, but indicated that he was prepared to agree to a reference of disputes to arbitration, when anyone, English or otherwise, might be selected as one of the arbitrators. 3. Sheykh Muhammad Ibrahim Jawan Bakhsh appeared satisfied with his conversation with the Minister of Finance and subsequently addressed to him a letter embodying his terms for the grant of the concession. I enclose a translation of this letter. 4. The present electrical equipment of Mecca consists of some ten or twelve separate plants, of which the most important are the one supplying the Haram, one in the King’s Palace, three in palaces of Amir Faisal and one or two in Govern ment buildings, the house of the Minister of Finance and possibly other members of the Royal Family. 5 I am sending copies of this despatch and enclosure to His Majesty’s Prin cipal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and to the Government of India.

Letter from His Majesty’s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 113, DATED THE 14TH APRIL 1933. No. 1. Sir A. Ryan to Sir John Simon.—{Received May 8th). In paragraph 5 of my despatch No. 23 of the 17th January, I stated that, so far as I could make out, the frontier between Azir and the Yemen appeared to abut on the sea at the mouth of the Wadi Tashar and to run inland in a direction which I proceeded to indicate. On re-reading the relevant papers I find that I was probably too guarded as regards the terminal on the sea. Although it is quite uncertain whether the frontier has been agreed as regards its whole length and certain that it has not been delimited, the Saudi official communique published on the 6th January and forwarded with my printed despatch No. 10 of the 8th January, speaks definitely of the Wadi Tashar, to which the Saudi troops claimed to have advanced, as being the furthest district on the coast. It may therefore MC464FD24 be assumed that the mouth of the Wadi in question is the boundary point in the eyes of the Saudi Government and the Government of the Yemen probably take the same view. 2. I think it worth while to draw attention to this point, even though it is unlikely to have escaped you, as it may be important for naval purposes to have a definite indication of the coastal point at which Saudi Arabia ends and the Yemen begins. In this connexion I may add that I now learn privately from the com manding officer of H. M. S. Penzance that the Island of Ashik, which I mentioned in paragraph 5 of the enclosure in my despatch No. 104 of the 9th April regarding naval visits to the Farsan Islands, &amp;c., lies off the coast 30 fniles south of Jizan, 11 miles north-north-west of Medi and about 2 miles south of the mouth of the Wadi Tashar. 3.

Letter from His Majesty’s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 118, DATED THE 16TH APRIL 1933. No. 1. With reference to paragraph 32 of the Jedda report enclosed in my despatch No. 102 of the 7th April (F. 81-N./33), I have the honour to state that Ibn. Sa’ud arrived in Jedda early yesterday and gave the usual series of formal audiences to the heads of foreign missions in the forenoon. He is staying at a large house which has recently been built by the Minister of Finance about a mile outside the town. It is already rumoured that the so-called “ Green Palace ” is to be turned into a hotel. Be this as it may, it is interesting to note the tightening of the cop- nexion between His Majesty and Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman, who spends but little time in Jedda and may have built his new house partly with a view to his master’s convenience. 2. I found the King affable, but he did not appear to be in the same good form as when I last saw him at the end of last August; I cannot say that he looked ill, but he gave the impression of suffering from nervous worry. He seemed distrait, and I had to initiate almost every subject of conversation. The nature of the audience required that the topics should be general. We discoursed of our respective states of health, the excellent rains that have fallen in Nejd, the virtues of water and the broader aspects of the recent pilgrimage. The most striking feature of this last part of the conversation was the King’s eagerness to assure me of his readiness to entertain suggestions for the betterment of pilgrimage condi tions. He repeated this assurance at least twice. 3. Mr. Furlonge, who was with me, agrees generally with my impression of the King’s physical state. He had not seen His Majesty for nearly two years and would not like to express himself too confidently, but he thought that Ibn Sa’ud presented the appearance of having aged considerably. 4. The King’s plans appear to be uncertain. If I should have any conversa tion with him of an important nature during his stay in Jedda, I will report sepa rately. 5.

Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter No. E. 2990/2990/25, dated 19th June 1933. Letter from His Majesty’s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 139- (1328/398/2), dated the 15th May 1933. In paragraph 18 of the Jedda Report for January to March 1932 (F. 139-N./32), Mr. Hope Gill mentioned a Sa’udi Commercial Code, the serial publication of which had been completed during that period. On my return to Jedda at the end of May 1 found awaiting me a portly volume containing a rough manuscript transla tion of this enormous document, which took up much space in successive numbers of the Umm-al-Qura newspaper from August 7th, 1931 to February 26th, 1932 inclusive. The vicissitudes of the remainder of the year made it impossible for me to give attention to it. Now that the storms of rebellion had died down, I owe it to the industry of my translators, if for no other reason, to give some brief account of so considerable an addition to the modern legislation of this country. It will be very brief indeed, as the code is a mere white elephant at present. It would be useless labour to check the translation, to have it typed and to study it closely. 2. The code is not one which the ordinary religious courts of this country would ever dream of applying. It is designed solely for the purpose of tribunals of the type known as Majlis-at-Tujar or Council of Merchants. Only one such court exists at present. It has its being in Jedda but I understand that its juris diction in commercial cases is supposed to extend to Mecca. So far as I know it is a very inept body but one seldom hears it mentioned at all, never, in my ex perience, in connexion with any important commercial suit. 3. The code provided for the use of this non-professional tribunal consists of four parts. Part I (Articles 1 to 149) deals with commerce on land and contains chapters dealing with the usual matters, including companies, agency, bills of exchange and insolvency. Part II (Articles 150 to 431) deals with maritime commerce and comprises, among others, chapters on the ownership of ships, seamen, bills of lading, freight and charter-party, passages, hypothecation of ships, etc., marine insurance and average. Part III (Articles 432 to 533) is devoted to the organisation and procedure of the Majlis-at-Tujar. Part IV (Articles 534 to 622) contains schedules of fees for various proceedings. Article 623 makes the code operative from the date of publication, presumably the date of the last instalment, as the code is not otherwise dated. The last Article, 624, charges the Viceroy with the execution of its provisions, a clause which indicates that, even in principle, the code was intended only to apply to the Hejaz, which at the time had not yet been merged in a unified Sa’udi Arabia. 4. I le^rn from Fuad Bey Hamza, who was probably the principal author of the code, that it was based mainly on the old Ottoman codes (see Young, Corps de Droit Ottoman, Volume VII, page 55 ff.). So far as I can judge from a hurried glance I should say that in the case of Parts I and III the adaptation had been done very freely, whereas Part II seems to follow the Ottoman Code of Maritime Commerce more closely. I confess, however, that I have had no time to study the Sa’udi text in detail. 5.

Letter from His Majesty’s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 182 (1702/199/10), dated the 14th June 1933. With reference to my despatch No. 119 of April 18, I have the honour to state that Ibn Sa’ud again came to Jedda early on June 10, in anticipation of an early departure for Riyadh. He gave his usual series of formal audiences to heads of foreign missions that morning, beginning with me, as the Soviet Minister was in Mecca. His Majesty appeared to be in good form and was as affable as usual. I presented Mr. Calvert. 2. Following on general conversation of the usual anodyne character, the King observed that the autumn was his busy time in Nejd, as it was there that the leading people flocked about him, each expecting the personal attention of the sovereign. He went on to say that within a year to two his son Sa’ad might be trained enough to relieve him of this burden. I took the opportunity of con gratulating His Majesty in person on the action he had so wisely taken to provide for the future of the throne. The King, in thanking me, stressed the fact that he had not taken the initiative but yielded to the appeals of his people. 3. The King’s remark about the Amir Sa’ud derives some significance from a report which reached me on June 3, in a form too uncertain to be worth reporting at the time that the King was contemplating abdication and was only .waiting for the return of the mission he had sent to the Yemen. Without wishing to exaggerate the probability of such an event at some not too distant date, I think that it should be borne in mind as a possibility. To a European it may seem unlikely that a man of 53 with Ibn Sa’ud’s past should contemplate such a step at the height of his achievement. I am not sure, however, that it would be alien to his character to retire in favour of the son, whom he has so spectacularly installed as Heir Apparent, hoping perhaps to guide the steps of his successor during the remainder of his own life. It is nearly three years since Fuad Bey spoke to me of the King’s desire to reduce his burden of responsibility and “ to reign rather than to rule ”,This forecast proved false but there have been faint indications of a slow move ment in that direction. Ibn Sa’ud has tended to lead a somewhat easier life than of old. He has left more in the hands of his advisers, though he still controls them all in major matters. He has accepted new constitutional forms, which, though they appear to us rather illusory at present, are not wholly unreal. Last year he made new secretarial arrangements at Riyadh, which involved the transfer to the Amir Sa’ud of his own chief secretary, Ibrahim ibn Muammar, who has now gone as Charge de’Affaires to Baghdad. 4. I collect these indications for two reasons. Slight as they are, they lend support to the idea that Ibn Sa’ud may end his active career, or at any rate his public career, by abdication rather than by death. Secondly, and this is of more mterest to His Majesty’s Government, such an intention would help to explain the rather marked tendency which Ibn Sa’ud has shown during the past year to seek to compose various differences which might militate against the success of a new ruler ; to disarm hostility among his own subjects ; and to reduce the possibilities of quarrel with neighbouring countries like ’Iraq, Transjordan, the Yemen and perhaps even Kuwait. 5. I sought a further audience with tbe King on June 11, to discuss business. I will report what passed separately in connexion with the subjects I raised, in so far as it may be necessary to record it. The King broached no subject of his own. 6. Ibn Sa’ud returned to Mecca late on June 12. During his short stay His Majesty gave a great deal of time to Captain H. C. Armstrong, who is writing his biography and whom he consented, as a result of correspondence through the Sa’udi Minister in London, to receive in Jedda. Captain Armstrong arrived on June 7. He had a general conversation with the King on June 10, and had four further audiences on June 11 and 12 of an average duration of some two hours each. The King has been most forthcoming and both parties appear to be exceedingly pleased with each other. I have avoided any appearance of promoting Captain Armstrong’s enterprise but he is staying with my wife and me on the strength of old friendship. 7. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Excellency the Viceroy of India (Foreign and Political Department), His Majesty’s Ambassador at Baghdad, His Majesty’s High Commissioners at Jerusalem and Cairo, the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, and_to His Majesty’s Chief Com missioner at Aden. ( 30 ) (Received on 22nd July 1933, with Political Secretary's letter No. 27, dated the 6th July 1933.) • Letter from His Majesty’s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 110, DATED THE 16TH May 1933. No. 1. In paragraph 32 of the Jedda report for March (F. 81-N./33), enclosed in my despatch No. 102 of the 7th April, I mentioned that Ibn Sa’ud had given a dinner to notable pilgrims on the evening of the 31st March. As you are aware, this is now a regular feature of each year’s pilgrimage season. On the present occasion, the King entertained some hundreds of guests of various nationalities, including several Indians. I understand from my Indian Vice-Consul that the attention shown both to Shia and to Indian pilgrims has been a feature of this year’s pilgrimage. In the case of the Indians the King and the Minister of Finance, who is largely responsible for dispensing such attention, had the advantage of the presence of Jemal Pasha Ghazzi, who has been conducting since last year an intensive pro-pilgrimage campaign in India and was able to make play with the intimacy he had established there with various participants in this year’s Haj. tu ^ ^ le s cus tom to speak at great length at these annual banquets. The published version of his address on the present occasion occupied a page and a half of the Umm-al-Qura of the 6th April. I enclose a short summary prepared in the Legation. ^rsas 28 3. The King preached from his usual text, the need for unity in Islam, but ic seems to ha\ e restrained almost entirely the tendency which he has sometimes shown in the past to give offence by his utterances regarding people who do not share his 'views. I understand that the published version of his speech represents the original pretty accurately, although the actual language used in certain passages may have been more emphatic. I have heard only one definite suggestion of any important omission. According to my Persian colleagues the King gave as one of tlie reasons why he could not aspire to the Caliphate the fact that so man} Muslim countries are under alien denomination. He is said to have included m the number Egypt as being under the thumb of Great Britain. If he really said this, it cannot have been pleasing to all his Egyptian hearers, though it might gratify some of them. &amp; 4.

Enclosure in No. 1. Summary of the Speech delivered by His Majesty King Abdul Aziz-ibn-Saud at the Banquet given on March 31,1933, at the Royal Palace at Mecca. (As published in Umm-al-Qura, April 6, 1933.) people, His Majesty said, enjoy one great blessing from God in the teachings of the Prophet, which have descended on them like the fertilisiim ram on the earth, and have been the means by which they have spread their influence over vast territories. All Moslems were indebted to that great Teacher for the good that they had ; and if they would but adhere to the commands of God, as given m the Koran and the sacred writings, they would be successful and degraded Ut ^ ^ theSe commands tlie y woul &lt;i become separated • + And * S is ’ Ki ?. g . wen * on ’ is what is happening now ; and he drew a picture of the sad condition of the Moslem world in general and the Arab people m particular at the present time. Some people imagine, he said, that the only remedy for this state is for Moslems to adopt European civilization ; but this was not true, for the teachings of the Koran guarantee prosperity, unity and happiness to those who follow them, because they make no differentiation between King and commoner, save in respect of piety alone. Nor were foreigners alone to blame for all the calamities which had overtaken Islam for amongst Moslems themselves they found some who were misonided and who were willing to aid them to work against Islam. “I am the Herald of Islam ”, the King concluded. He was an Arab Moslem who served Islam and who worked for the spread of Islam and for Moslem unity • and he was prepared to sacrifice himself and his family in the defence of Islam! He did not aim to be a chief on earth ; of greatest importance to him was to make God s word supreme, and m pursuit of this he cared for no difficulties Many had opposed him since he first put forward this aim, but had been vanquished. t , , ^ l iat dld ^ want hlm ? His actions were clear ; he followed the Way It had been said that he claimed to be Khalif over all Islam. He made no such claim. A Khalif must enforce the commands of the Islamic religion over the whole world of Islam, and this was possible in the time of the Khilafat; but was there a man who could so do at the present time ? It was clearly impossible and ail he himself desired was unity and co-operation among Moslems. Behind him were more than 400,000 warriors ; if he wept they wept • if he rejoiced they rejoiced ; and if he commanded they obeyed his commands. ’ These were the Troops of Unity, the brethren of all who obeyed God, ready to fight for God and expecting nothing from it except to satisfy God ; and this was the force (t0 ?°j drm Religious Law and Islam throughout the territories over which he ruled. MC364FD—25—19 -8-33—G IPS29 n (31) {Received on 5th August 1933, with Political Secretary's letter No. 29, dated 20th July 1933.) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter dated 17th July 1933. ^Letter .from His Majesty's Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 147, dated the 20th May 1933. Since I wrote my despatch No. 331 of the 2nd August last [Serial No. (101) in F. 9-N.|32], incidental reference only has been made in reports from this Legation to M. van Leeuwen, the Dutch expert who entered the service of the Saudi Government in April 1932 as financial adviser. I have now to record ins final departure from Jedda on the 18th May. 2. M. van Leeuwen returned from sick leave in or about October last. This leave interrupted what was to have been a year of continuous service, to be followed by a period of leave on full pay before his contract finally expired. I believe it was agreed that he should draw no salary for the period of his absence last year, and should make up for the time lost by serving for an additional three months at the end of the year originally contemplated. 3. Unfortunately M. van Leeuwen’s health has continued to be precarious. He has had several' bouts of illness during the spring, and this has been the immediate cause of his leaving for good. It must be attributed in pmt, however, to the hopelessness of his position in the Administration here. I do not think that he has at any time been allowed to do more than write academic reports, and it has been increasingly evident of late that he could plav no effectiv e role in a department dominated by the personality and methods of Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman. 4 Things were not improved bv M. van Leeuwen’s condemnation of the National Bank scheme (F. 85-N.|33) 'projected by the ex-Khedive and his asso ciates. By the time this was launched he had lost patience to such an extent that he abandoned his previous attitude of discretion and expressed his adveise opinion to outsiders like myself. Saudi circles were very ready to think that Ins hostility to the scheme was due to apprehension lest it should damage the posi tion of the Netherlands Trading Society, which is, as you know, the only orga nised bank here and in which he was formerly employed. The suspicion may have been increased by the fact that, for reasons of health, he had gone to stay indefinitely wfith the Netherlands Charge d Affaires. 5 It was to be foreseen that no adviser could reorganise the finances of this country in a year, least of all in a year so inauspicious as one beginning m April 1932 when they were already in a desperate condition and the whole world as well was in a mess. It is, however, lamentable that M. van Leeuwen, of whose capacity I cannot judge, but who was an honest and industrious man should not have had a chance of doing anything at all. He had no axe to grind, and I do not think that the Netherlands authorities made any attempt to use liim tor then own purposes. The Dutch Charge d’Affaires has assured me that since he presented M van Leeuwen to the King he has scrupulously refrained from meddling in his affairs, and has not seen his report^. I believe this to he tme, and I shall be all the sorrier for M. Adriaanse if, as is possible he has to concern himself with the final settlement of account between the Saudi Government and their late adviser.

G. have, however, now sanctioned the payment of three years stipend to Your Highness commencing from 1st April 1930, and ending with 31st March 1933. Owing to the closing of the current tinancial year in March, we have drawn the amount due from 1st April 1930 to 28th February 1933 (2 years and 11 months), i.e., Rs. 2,100 minus Rs: 7-14-0 oh account of Bank commission which we remit to you by draft No. 71|104, dated 25th March 1933.

The matter was referred to His Majesty’s Government and I was keenly waiting for the favourable decision of the same and hence I ( ‘] an l\^ 1( ' arrears of stipend of the usual amount of all these years. Then finally I had discussions with Colonel Lake for the arrears. Under the above circumstances I request your honour to refer the above matter a^ain to His Majesty’s Government that the amount of the stipend should be increased to Rupees onei thousand monthly, and if the above request is not oranted mv stipend arrears from October 1918 up to October 1933, should be granted because I did not claim the arrears only thinking that the matter was under discussion and so my claim for the amount of the arrears of all these years should not be debarred at all. I herewith return the draft No. 71|104, dated 25th March 1933, for the amount of Rs. 2,100 with a request to send me the draft of the full amount of nil these years as mentioned above. I will keep up the terms of the treaty end .he R ame friendly relations and co-operation with the Government if at all I am not paid. ' . Enclosure 4 to Serial No. (35).

I note Your Highness’s explanation that you have not in the past claimed the stipend to which yon became entitled on your accession in 1922 for the reason that you were awaiting the decision of Government in regard to your request for an increase in the amount of your stipend. 3. I would however observe that the decision of Government in this matter was conveyed to Your Highness by the then Resident in his letter No. C.|77 of the 30th January 1925, and since that time Your Highness has been given no assurance or other indication that could in any way lead von to hope that the decision was likely to he reversed, or was indeed even under discussion.33 4. There is now in any case no question of Your Highness’s recovering from His Majesty’s Government the arrears of stipend accrued up to the s April 1927 the date on which His Majesty’s Government assumed responsi bility for the Aden Protectorate from the Government of India. 5 Furthermore, on your first visit to Aden after that date, m October 1998 the then Resident made it sufficiently clear to Your Highness that he was not prepared to recommend to His Majesty’s Government your request for financial assistance; and Your Highness’s subsequent representation to the Resident in October 1932 was not more favourably received. 6 In these circumstances I regret that I am unable to recommend to His Majesty’s Government Your Highness’s explanation of the reason for the accumulation of the arrears of stipend, nor to move them to reconsider their decision to pay those arrears in respect only of the period from 1 st April 19ot). 7 In regard to Your Highness’s wish for an increase in stipend, I regret that I cannot see my wav to making any recommendation to His Majesty’s Gov ernment at the present time ; for whatever may be the opinion of this Residency as to the adequacy or otherwise of the stipend at present appertaining to the Sultanate of Shihr and Mukalla, the fact that Your Highness, during the eleven years since your accession, has spent altogether less than 3 years m your territories must mitigate against a favourable consideration of Your Highness s requests. In this connection I would again commend to Your Highness s most earnest attention the Resident’s advice contained in his letter No. 2497 of the 19th April 1933.

(Letter from His Majesty’s Minister, Jedda, to His Majesty’s Embassy, Baghdad, dated the July 4th, 1933. Many thanks for your Secret letter (243|4|33) of June 19th [Enclosure to Serial No. (33)]. I cannot connect your information’s story about the German Minister in Baghdad with anything of which I have knowledge here. You will have seen from my monthly reports that there has been much hatching of financial and economic schemes but this is a new one on me. I do not quite know what the security of the Port of Jedda means. One of the few good assignable securities here would be the heavy quarantine dues collected from all pilgrims and other travellers by sea. It is easy money for the Government as the shipping companies include the dues in the cost of the tickets, but the Government have shown no readiness to assign any revenue, whether customs or quarantine dues or other to the service of a loan. As for an unsecured loan, there are philanthropists like the e:r-Khedive of Egypt, etc., who seem ready to produce or promise money without obvious inducement ; but I doubt whether they include Germans. The German trading Consul here told me last year that, when the Sa’udi mission tried to get money in various capitals, Berlin was one ; and he laughed. He is now away for an indefinite period. All the same, if you hear anything more on the subject it would interest me to have it. I am sending a copy of this to Rendel.

Enclosure in Colonial Office covering letter, No. 18113|33, dated 20th September 1933. Note by Capt. J. B. Glubb on a conyersiation in which he took part on leaving Amman ; the note is self-explanatory. Note by Captain Glubb on a conversation with the Amir Shakir. On 24th August, just as I was about to start for England on leave, I received a message from the Amir Shakir, stating that he wished to visit me to say good bye. He arrived a few minutes later. He began at once by saying that he was personally in little anxiety at the presence of Ibn Saud in the Hejaz. Ibn Saud was a bedouin, ruling unstable bedouins, and he (Shakir) was really not greatly perturbed whether Ibn Saud remained ten years or twenty years in the Hejaz, because he was perfectly certain that the Saudis could not rule the Hejaz per manently. Their fall was simply a matter of time, and then the Sherifsi would return. The Shcrifs had very deep rooted loyalties and associations in the39 Hejaz, and it was only the almost insane conduct of King Husain, which made it possible for ]bn Saud temporarily to overthrow the Sherifs. The case of the Imam Yahya was, however, quite different. If the Imam Yahya were to obtain the sovereignty of the Hejaz, “ death would be better for us (By us he presumably meant the Sherifs now in exile in Iraq and Trans- Jordan). The Imam was, he said, a very different proposition to Ibn Saud, and was also a Sherif. At the moment, the Imam was not saying anything about conquering the Hejaz, but, if war broke out, and he conquered Asir, where he has great influence, he would dominate the Hejaz, and the Holy Cities would drop into his lap, almost without an effort. Ibn Saud was 'weak and unpopular in the Hejaz, and the Akhwan had suffered frightfully in the recent operations in Asir. The very name of Asir was now anathema in Nejd, and it would be difficult to raise any kind of a force in Nejd, if fresh hostilities were now to break out in that area. His Highness went on to say that the Sherifs had great influence in the Hejaz, and that he himself had recently received letters from the Southern Hejaz and Asir. He had letters from one whose name I think he said was Ibn Abda awl from the Zeraniq and other tribesmen of the Red Sea littoral of Asir. These people had remained neutral in the Idris v. Ibn Saud rebellion. Many of them wrote to him now to ask his advice. They said that they were not greatly concerned whether Ibn Saud retained the rule of the country or not, but the flrst thing which they wanted to know was whether there was any chance of a return of the Sherifs. If Shakir could promise tlmm any support, such as that of the British, which gave any hopes of success, they would be ready to declare for the Sherifs. Failing this, they would be obliged to choose the next best from amongst the other competing rulers. The Amir mentioned the names of several tribes, but as 1 was not familiar with them, I cannot recollect them for certain, except the Beni Shahi ’ and the Zeraniq. His Highness continued that he was unable, of course, to answer these letters or lake any action in any matters of this nature, owing to the attitude of the British and their ever ready suspicions that he was intriguing against Ibn Saud. But at any rate, he pointed out, both Ibn Saud and the Sherifs were allies of the British, whereas the Imam Yahya most emphatically was not. The inter ference of the British had prevented the Sherifs replacing Ibn Saud in the Hejaz, with the result that Ibn Saud’s obvious weakness was now tempting the Imam Yahya to take the offensive. It really looked as if Ibn Saud would soon collapse. The British did not offer him active support, but merely limited their help to preventing the Sherifs from over-throwing him. It seemed probable that the result would be that the Imam Yahya, over whom the British had no control would step in and take the Hejaz himself, to the exclusion of all Great Britain’s allies. If the Sherifs were to recover the Holy Cities, His Highness continued, they could easily come to an agreement with Ibn Saud, who would remain the ruler of Nejd. This was the natural arrangement, only upset by the insanity of King Husain. But any arrangement would be better than allowing the Imam Yahya to come in. His Highness then said that he had intended to speak to me on this subject for a considerable time, as also to Mr. Kirkbride, the acting British Resident, but that he had hesitated and procrastinated until he heard that I was about to leave, when he made up his mind to speak immediately. He hoped that I would have an opportunity in London to make known what he had said, to His Majesty’s Government. He had intended also to tell Mr. Kirkbride. Should he do so, or would I be seeing Mr. Kirkbride ? 1 .replied that I had already said good bye to Mr. Kirkbride, and had not time to see him again, as my car was at the door and I was catching Imperial Airways. I promised, however, to submit the gist of what he had said, to the Colonial Office in London. He then remarked “ It is obvious now, that Feisal is the only man in the Sherifian family who can do a job of work ”. I enquired whether King Feisal’s views agreed with those which His High ness had just expressed to me. He replied emphatically that their views were absolutely identical. I said that, in that case it seemed probable that King Feisal would already have explained them to His Majesty’s Government, as he had just returned from Europe. His Highness replied that he did not know if the King had done so or not, though he believed that His Majesty had no secrets from his friends the English (!!!).40 His Highness then took his leave, again assuring me of the vital importance of keeping the Imam Yahya out of the Hejaz at all costs, adding that the Imam was now immensely powerful, that he had invited all the Yemen under his un disputed sway, and that, if he completed the conquest of Nejran, he would be within striking distance of Riyadh itself, in addition to being able to threaten the Hejaz through Asir. I hope that I will not be thought to have acted irregularly in submitting direct to the Colonial Office, a report on a conversation which occurred before 1 left Amman. As stated above, however, the Amir Shakir made these statements in a visit ostensibly made to say goodbye, when my car and luggage was at the door. 1 could not possibly have committed it to paper, without missing the Imperial Airways machine, on which my passage was already booked and paid for. I presume that copies of this note will be forwarded to Jerusalem and Amman, with this explanation as to the method of its submission. ( 45 ) {Received on 7tl+ August 1933, with Political Secretary’s letter No. 38, dated 21st September September 1933.) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter, dated 16th September 1933. No. 1. Memorandum respecting Petroleum in Arabia {as revised by Petroleum Depart ment .— {Received in Foreign Office, August 11, 1933.) (A)— Petroleum Prospects of Arabia. (1) LITTORAL Region of the Ilejaz. —Petroliferous deposits and seepage have long been known to exist in this area. Interest in it was stimulated by Mr. TwitchelPs survey in 1931 in the coastal region north of Jedda, but this area seems to have dropped into the background of late. In a report furnished by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company to the Petroleum Department in 1932, it was pointed out that the general structure of the Red Sea is known geologically as a “ Rift Valley,” that is, a sunken valley bounded on either side by rift faults. The prospects of finding oil in commercial quantity are considered to be remote, though not entireiy non-existent, and even after a complete survey, “ Rift Valley conditions ” are such that any test drilling would be very speculative. (2) Hasa and Koweit Neutral Zone. —It has been thought for many years that this region might produce oil. The idea that it may be underlain by rocks of the same geological age as those of the Iraq and Persian oil-fields, and that potential oil structures might exist extending from Koweit to Qatar inclusive, has been encouraged by the striking of oil in quantity in Bahrein in 1932. (3) '!he Farsan Islands and Asir. —Interest in these islands andior the mainland of Asir, from the point of view of petroleum potentialities, seems to date from before the Great War. Operations were actually started on one of the islands by the Red Sea Petroleum Company, a subsidiary of the Shell Group, in 1926 or early in 1927, but drilling operations were subsequently abandoned as unsuccessful. As to Asir, see (D) (2). (4) Molcalla. —In 1928-29 the Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company (Shell Group) carried out investigations, and reached the conclusion that the petroleum prospects were quite unfavourable. (5) Muscat--The Anglo-Persian Oil Company abandoned this area as un favourable in 1925-26. (B)— Interested or Potentially Interested Companies. (1) The Iraq Petroleum Company. —The Turkish Petroleum Company (now the Iraq Petroleum Company) was formed in 1912, when the Deutsche Bank became associated with the National Bank of Turkey and the Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company (Royal Dutch Shell Group), in order to press certain claims to oil rights in Baghdad and Mosul, including those attached to the Baghdad Railway Concession. The chief rival of the new company at that time was the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, which had for some time been in negotiation with the Turkish Government. In 1914 an agreement was entered into providing for the reconstitution of the Turkish Petroleum Company, from which the National Bank of Turkey withdrew, the new participants being the Anglo- Persian Oil Company, 50 per cent. ; the Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company and41 the Deutsche Bank, 25 per cent. each. This agreement also provided that the three groups should give undertakings not to be interested directly or indiiect j in the production of oil in the Ottoman Empire in Europe and Asia (excluding Egypt, Koweit and the Transferred Territories), except through the Turkish Petroleum Company. This agreement was signed by the British and German Governments, and by the groups concerned. As the Turkish Petroleum Company was then predominantlv British, this arrangement had the effect of securing the whole of this area to interests which were predominantly British. After the war American and French interests were admitted into the Iraq Petroleum Company and the arrangement as regards non-competition between the groups composing the Iraq Petroleum Company was confirmed in an agreement between the groups, entered into in 1928. This was a private agreement between the groups with which the British Government was not associated. Under this agreement a line was drawn round Arabia, Palestine and Asia Minor, which excluded the Sultanate of Koweit and the Farsan Islands, but included Bahrein, and an area was thus defined within which the various groups constituting the Iraq Petroleum Company agreed that they would not seek for or obtain oil concessions otherwise than through the Iraq Petroleum Company or its nominee. On the admission of French and American interests the share capital of the Iraq Petroleum Company was distributed as follows :— Percentage. Anglo-Persian Oil Company Royal Dutch Shell .. French Group American GroupO) .. C. S. Gulbenkian .. 23.75 .. 23.75 .. 23.75 .. 23.75 .. 5.00 100.00 As the Royal Dutch Shell is 60 per cent. Dutch and 40 per cent. British, the British shareholding in the company now only represents about 33| per cent. The Iraq Petroleum Company is still technically a British company, as m article 32 of its convention with the Government of Iraq the company must be and remain a British company, registered in Great Britain, and the chairman must at all times be a British subject. But the position is different from a British point of view, from that which formerly obtained when the company was British in fact as well as in name. Apart from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and the Burmah Oil Company, there are no really large oil companies which are entirely British, and which could compete with the big groups represented on the Iraq Petroleum Company. The Burmah Oil Company has never been inclined to undertake exploration work outside India. There may, however, be some instances where the Iraq Petroleum Company is not prepared to seek concessions in the reserved area, and where the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, either by itself or in association with one or more of the other groups, may be allowed to acquire concessions. (2) British Oil Dcvcloprucyit Compayiy and Mosul Oil-fields (Limited)* On the 20th April 1932, the Iraq Government granted an oil concession to the British Oil Development Company (Limited) over the western portion of Iraq. The concession is for a period of seventy-five years and covers an area of about 40 000 square miles, comprising all Iraq lands situated west of the River Tigris and north of the thirty-third parallel of latitude. A special law confirming the British Oil Development Concession was passed and published in the Official Gazette on the 29th May 1932. This is reckoned as the date of the commencement of the concession. The company must be and remain a Bntish company registered in Great Britain, and the chairman must be a British^ subjec . There is, however, a large foreign interest in the company. The British Oil (!)

Mola (Italy), three representatives of the Italian Azienda Generale Italiana Petroli, and E. C. Simmons (solicitor). At some stage, but when it actually occurred is not clear from the information available, German and Franco-Swisa interests were also included.

The company at one time apnroached the - without success, and in 1927 and 1929 transferred^rfutrests to tb Gulf Oil Corporation of IT. S. A. [see under (5 below)] Its Lctl ^1? T” tive is Major F. Holmes. ;J ' lts lo cal represents-(5) The Gulf Oil Corporation is a wholly American concern, working in the Near East through its subsidiary, the Eastern Gulf Oil Company. The Gull Oil Corporation is a powerful company engaged in producing, transporting, relining and marketing oil throughout the United States, east of the Rocky Mountains. It is also engaged in producing oil in Mexico, Venezuela and Colombia, and markets oil extensively in Europe. The principal interest in it is that of the Mellon family, who are said to have come in originally as finan ciers and to have ended up with an 80 per cent, interest. The Gulf is an independent company, but it is interested with the Socony—Vacuum Company (a recent merger of the Standard Oil Company of New York and Vacuum Oil Company), and S. O., New Jersey, in the I. P. C. It is also interested with the Eastern and General Syndicate in a possible concession in Koweit. In 1927 it obtained on option from the Eastern and General on the Bahrein Con cession, which the syndicate had secured in December 1925. Eventually, how ever, this concession was taken over by the Standard Oil of California, presum ably because the Gulf, as a member of the I. P. C., could not hold it. In 1929 it acquired from the Eastern and General Syndicate an option over any rights which the syndicate might possess in Hasa, the neutral zone and Koweit. It could only operate concessions in Hasa and probably also in the neutral zone with the permission of the I. P. C. (6) Standard Oil Company of California. —After the break-up of the Standard Oil Group in 1912, many members of the group became independent, including the above company. This company is one of the largest oil companies in the United States, and is a complete unit, being engaged in producing, re fining, transporting and marketing crude oil and refined products. The company is engaged in production in eight States in the United States, and has oil properties in Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela. The Standard Oil Company of California and the Gulf are independent of each other, although there is a general impression that the various Standard Oil Companies still have some community of interest and are prepared to co-operate in matters of general policy. At times, however, there has been keen competition between them. As pointed out above, the Standard Oil Company of California holds the Bahrein Concession, which it operates through the Bahrein Petro leum Company, a Canadian Corporation. It has also just secured from Ibn Saud an oil concession in Hasa, full particulars of which are not yet available. (C)— Past Concessions affecting Saudi Arabia. (1) Northern Hejaz. —It is possible that certain concessionary rights were granted in Turkish times, but this subject has not been explored in the Lega tion. There was talk of a concession under the Hashimite regime and Mr. Philby was one of those interested, but there is no evidence of a Hashimite concession having been granted. Any interest of Mr. Philby’s is presumably identical with that of Midian (Limited), an inactive but still going concern, closely allied with Sharquieh (Limited). (2) Jedda (Hejaz, West Coast of Arabia).—Two American engineers (Twitchell and Crane) carried out investigations for oil in 1931. The Petro leum Department brought the matter to the notice of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, who replied that the geological prospects in this area were not regarded as favourable [see under paragraph (A) (1)]. (3) Muscat. —The Anglo-Persian Oil Company obtained a concession in 1925 to prospect for oil for a period of two years with the right to a mining lease, but this concession has now lapsed. (4) Mokalla. —The Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company started negotiations for a concession in 1928-29, but the matter was not proceeded with as they reached the conclusion that the prospects of discovering petroleum were quite unfavourable. (5) Hasa.—The Anglo-Persian Oil Company applied, probably for prospecting rights only, to Ibn Sand in 1921. The E.G.S. came into the field later At the beginning of 1923 Major Holmes submitted a draft concession to Sir P. Cox. In March 1923, the latter, acting under instructions from home suggested to Ibn Saud that he should decide nothing until he had had an opportunity of considering an offer by A.P.O.C., whom His Majesty’s Govern ment considered to have a prior claim. About the same period or earlier the two companies were m touch with each other with a view to sharing interests, and it is stated that at one point they went through a pretence of breaking offnegotiations so that Ibn Sand might give the concession to E.G.S. in ignorance of the interest of A.P.O.C., to whom he was hostile. Be that as it may, E.G.S. got the concession, and on the 6th May, 1923, Ibn Sand granted an oil concession (including the Qatif and Jubail areas) to the Eastern and General Syndicate. Major Holmes gave an undertaking not to sell part of the concession to the A.P.O.C., and His Majesty’s Government thought of trying to induce Ibn Saud to cancel this restriction, but the proposal was abandoned in May 1924. Thus the A.P.O.C. were left out in the cold. The final terms of the concession to E.G.S. are not known, but there are indications that it followed the draft which had been submitted to Sir P. C°x. That draft, and probably the actual concession, included inter alia, provision for the following :— * (a) Lapse of the concession if E.G.S. should fail to start operations in a specified manner within nine months. (b) Government right to cancel the concession after any continuous cessation of operations for more than twenty months. (c) Payment of £3,000 a year for “special protection ” in half-yearly payments to begin sixty days after date. {d) Pavment of £6,000 under pain of nullity of the concession, sixty days after date. , (e) Arbitration in the event of any dispute. It is not clear what, if anything, E.G.S. did to implement the undertaking to start operations. It is known that on the 26th April, 1924, two geologists of theirs left Koweit to make a preliminary survey in “ Nejd, Koweit Neutral Zone and Hasa,” but it is not known to what this led. Anyhow, Major Holmes was in difficulties with Ibn Saud in October 1925, because, according to Bushire telegram to the Colonial Office of the 31st October, (a) Ibn Saud had refused to alter a clerical error of date, and (b) E.G.S. would advance no more money. There was also apparently difficulty in obtaining financial support in London owing to the non-existence of British diplomatic representation at Nejd. It was probably at this time or a little later that E.G.S. and Major Holmes estranged Ibn Saud by refusing a payment which he claimed. There is no evidence that Ibn Saud formally cancelled the concession at this juncture. When, however, E.G.S. entered into an agreement with the Gulf Company on the 30th November, 1927, in regard to this, the Neutral Zone Concession and the hoped-for concession in Koweit, they admitted that both the former were “ at least subject to forfeiture and cancellation, if not actually null and void.” The negotiations which led to the grant of a concession in Hasa to the Standard Oil of California are understood to have been conducted by that company directly, and not through the intervention of the E.G.S. (6) Koweit Neutral Zone .—On the 17th May, 1924, an oil concession is alleged to have been granted jointly by Ibn Saud and the Sheikh of Koweit to the E.G.S. The E.G.S., by an agreement of the 30th November, 1927, trans ferred any rights which it might possess or acquire or which could be re instated in Hasa or the Neutral Zone as well as in Koweit to the Eastern Gulf Oil Company. The history of the concession is somewhat obscure. A recent Colonial Office memorandum concludes from a review of the known facts the “ impression .... that Iban Saud did actually grant the concession on his own without the consent of the Sheikh of Koweit.” As against this, E.G.S. definitely claimed to have got the concession from both, and it seems hardly likely that they would have committed themselves to this statement if it were untrue, in their definite legal agreement with the Gulf Company of the 30th November, 1927, as they certainly did. In any case, however, the grounds for considering this concession to have lapsed are even stronger than in the ease of the Hasa Concession. E.G.S. not only admitted in the agreement with Gulf that it was like the other “ at least subject to forefeiture,” &amp;c., but stated in a letter to the Colonial Office of the 19th December, 1928 that it had “ never been made operative.” The Sheikh of Koweit’s account of this concession is given in a recent despatch from the Political Agent dated the 6th July, 1933, which states that the Political Resident had an interview with the Sheikh and discussed the45 matter. The Sheikh’s recollection was that Ibn Sand gave the Plasa Conces sion proper to Major Holmes in the spring of 1923, its chief clause being that unless Major Holmes started work within three years the concession would lapse. Ibn Saud wrote in the summer of 1923 and sent the Sheikh a draft joint concession in respect of the Kowiet Neutral Zone, which he wished to give to Major Holmes’s company, the E.G.S., and asking the Sheikh to sign it. His Majesty’s Government informed the Sheikh that he could sign the joint concession. The concession was actually signed in April 1924, and consisted of only four pages, and it was duly sent on to Ibn Sand. About a year after wards Major Holmes had a disagreement with Ibn Saud, who informed Major Holmes that the joint Neutral Zone Concession was there and then can celled. Ever since the Sheikh of Kowiet has assumed the joint concession to be a dead letter, that is to say, from about April 1925. The Sheikh of Koweit has been unable to ascertain whether Ibn Saud has included the Neutral Zone in the Hasa Concession recently granted to the Standard Oil Company of California. (7) Farsan Islands, now also a part of Saudi Arabia. —E.G.S. would appear to have obtained some sort of a concession for the Farsans (and possibly the mainland of Asir) from Hasan-al-Idrisi in 1926. It is not clear what became of this concession, if the grant was complete, but it was superseded by a con cession for the Farsans given by the Idrisi on the 25th September, 1926, to a Mr. Cooper, who marketed it to the Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company (Royal Dutch Shell Group). The latter formed the Red Sea Petroleum Company to work it. This company started operations of some importance at Zifaf Island. The Idrisi, acting, it was thought at the time, under Italian influence, but more probably under that of Iban Saud, made difficulties in the summer of 1927. After abortive efforts by the company to overcome them, Ibn Saud came for ward ostensibly in the role of honest broker between the Idrisi, now his vassal and the company. A conference held at Wizan in December 1927 under his auspices between the representatives of the company and the Idrisi was again abortive. Ibn Saud eventually intimated “ a decision in the question of the dispute which we were asked to settle between the Red Sea Petroleum Company and the Idrisi Government ” to the effect that a new concession should be drawn up and that in the meantime it would be undesirable to accede to a request which the company had put forward for permission to transfer their operations from Zifaf to Great Farsan. He suggested that the company should send a representative to Jedda to negotiate the revised concession. On his persisting in this attitude the company decided to withdraw from the islands and in September 1928 they removed all material under the auspices of H.M.S. Dahlia. It must be assumed that this terminated any rights under the Cooper Concession. The Shell Company has recently stated that it is not interested to reopen operations in the Farsan Islands. (D)— Present Position. Whatever view might possibly be held as to the legal position in regard to past concessions, it is quite certain that Ibn Saud believes himself to be quit of all of them and he is probably right. The position in regard to the various areas may be summed up as follows :— (1) Northern Hejaz. —Midian (Limited), closely associated with Sharqieh (Limited) or some other concern, may have had rights in this area, but there is no reason to think that they survive. No one seems to be actively interested at present. (2) Asir. —Ibn Saud in June 1933 intimated that he would be prepared to consider offers for a concession from British companies. The matter was referred by the Petroleum Department to the I.P.C. within whose sphere of in fluence Asir fell and who were the only company with any British interests who were likely to be prepared to consider the .matter. The I.P.C. have intimated that they are prepared to send out geologists to make an examination if they can secure the necessary rights without payment during the exploratory period. (3) Hasa. —After some competition between tHe Iraq Petroleum Companv (who sent a representative out to negotiate in 1933) and the Standard Oil Company of California, a concession was ultimately granted to the latter. It is understood from information obtained from the I.P.C. that the concession was signed on the 29th May, 1933, the terms being an initial payment of £30,000 (yold) and a further deferred payment of £20,000 (gold) with a royalty at 5s. per ton.46 (4) Qatar .—The A.P.O.C., acting on their own initiative but with the object of transfer to the I.P.C. secured an exclusive option from the Sheikh to carry out geological investigations for a period of two years with the right to apply for a concession within that period. A draft concession approved by the I.P.C. has recently been submitted by the A.P.O.C. to the Sheikh. (5) Koweit Neutral Zone .—The present position in regard to this area is not clear. It may be true that Major Holmes’s primary object in coming to Jedda in April 1933 was to obtain Ibn Sand’s consent to a regrant, so far as the Saudi Government are concerned, of a concession for this area. But it may also be the. case that so far as Ibn Sand is concerned, he has included the Neutral Zone with the Hasa Concession. This position is at present under consideration by His Majesty’s Government. (6) Farsan Islands .—There has been no activity since 1928 and both the Shell and the Anglo-Persian have recently informed the Petroleum Depart ment that they are not interested any longer in obtaining a concession over these islands.

Letter from His Majesty’s Charge d’affaires, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 285, dated the 9th September 1933. No. I. With reference to Mr. Hope Gill’s despatch No. 160 of the 31st March 1932 F. 140-N.I32), paragraph 4, relative to the activities of Mr. K. S. Twitched in regard to the Jedda water supply, I have the honour to report that water has again been brought to Jedda from the wells at Waziriya, and the event was ceremonially inaugurated on the 26th August in the presence of the Minister of Finance, local notables, and a large gathering of townspeople. As the result of the discovery of a fresh spring, to the south-east of the wells themselves, work has been in progress for some months past, under the direction of Sheikh Muhammad Dehlavi and experts of the Mecca water supply of Ain iZubeyda. The water has been led through the old pipes, put down in Turkish times, and now falls into the Idarus reservoir, situated on the outskirts of one of the poorer quarters of the town. The present rate of flow, according to Mr. Twitched, who still shows active interest in this undertaking, is 40 gallons per minute, and this, he says, it will shortly be possible to increase to as much as three times that amount on the completion of work on a second conduit which runs alongside the first, but which is not yet connected over its entire length. 2. Mr. Twitched points out that here there is an ample and cheap water supply sufficient for the needs of the town, whose present rate of consumption he places at 38 gallons per minute. Although other local experts would estimate the local rate of consumption at probably not more than 24 gallons per minute, it may be conceded that the new source of supply is more than sufficient, is cheap (for it costs nothing at the Idarus reservoir), and at present is reasonably safe at source. The Indian Medical Officer attached to this Legation recently conducted an analysis of the water, chemically and bacteriologicady, and pronounced it to be fit for consumption. The total water consumption of Jedda, therefore, may be expected to increase, particularly as the poorer classes are able to draw as much as they require for the mere trouble of carrying it away. 3. From past experience, however, considerable doubt is expressed as to the prospects of Waziriya water becoming a permanent factor in the town’s water supply. The doubt is not diminished by reports that, although from Waziriya to Has Qaim (a place 5 Idiom, from Jedda) the conduit has been cemented and is at present fairly sound, over the remaining distance the nipes are old and rotten and require constant care to prevent leakage. Sheikh Muhammad Dehlavi has unsuccessfully approached the Jedda municipality in an endeavour to get the pipe-line thoroughly repaired, and has now placed the matter before Ibn Sand, stating his preference for a cement conduit over iron piping.47 4. In the meantime, the sea-water distillery, or condenser plant, continues to supply the town with drinking- water of a kind at the rate of about 84 gallons per minute, and the English engineer in charge anticipates no great reduction in demand for his product, in spite of its greater cost, on account of the lack of confidence in Waziriya water on the part of those who are able to afford the other. 5. A copy of this despatch is being sent to the Principal Secretary of Stale for Foreign Affairs and to the Department of Overseas Trade.

The following were the main points of interest in a general conversation which I had with Mr. Philby yesterday afternoon. As I have reported from Jedda Mr. Philby now-a-days speaks to me pretty freely. I told him that I made use of what he told me for the information of His Majesty’s Government but that, subject to this, he could always rely on me to respect his confidence and avoid compromising him. State Bank. Mr. Philby spoke of the breach between the e^-Khedive and Shadid, of whom he (Mr. Philby) now has a very poor opinion, though he was greatly impressed by him in Jedda. He considered it clear that Shadid had misrepre sented to the Saudi Government in the spring his position vis-a-vis of the ex- Khedive, from whom he pretended to have received full powers to treat and conclude an agreement. After getting the contract, he had avoided meeting Abbas Hihni. He had embarrassed the latter more particularly by getting the Saudi Government to make out drafts in his own (Shadid’s) favour to cover their share in certain expenses and by evading a request from the c.T-Khedive to hand them over. The amount was not great but it was a dirty business, as Abbas Hilmi was morally responsible to the Saudi Government. According to Mr. Philby the err-Khedive, with whom and whose entourage he has been in touch, wants to behave honourably, but is not keen on the bank affair, which would only attract him, if he could get British financial backing. Everybody con cerned appears to consider that Shadid’s arrangement with the Saudi Govern ment was impossible. Air. Philby has outlined in the Khedivial circle (apparently without any mandate from the Saudi Government) his ideas of a workable contract, providing for a much smaller capital and a loan of sav £stg.l00,000 instead of one of £gold 200,000. This record of a friendly conversation over the tea-table maV not be exact in every particular, but it represents with sufficient accuracy the' main lines of what Air. Philby told me.

Saudi Financial Situation. Air. Philby expressed disappointment that alleging their preoccupation with the Yemeni posed to use any part of the money received California to effect part payment 'of their lJie uuismnm™ balance of which he estimates at something like £150,000 gold, including the debts m which he is interested (Marconi, Standard Oil of New York, Sha?qielq the Saudi Government danger, seemed indis- fi’om Standard Oil of debts, the outstanding-48 Limited and, I think, Ford) which he now puts at about £50,000 gold. He said that he had got the interest on all these debts, between £2,000 and £3,000—a statement which does not quite agree with what he told me sometime ago in Jedda. He had no idea what the Saudi Governmentiwould do when the present moratorium expires in November next. He agreed that they would do well to make some sort of businesslike arrangement and stick to it but seemed to take a very moderate view of the likelihood of their doing so. This record of a friendly conversation over the tea-table may not be exact in every particular, but it represents with sufficient accuracy the main lines of what Mr. Philby told me.

Port Sudan,—As previously reported, “ Penzance ” arrived at Port Sudan at 0700 on 2nd September * * * * * * 7. On 8th September, the Master of the S. S. “ Jehangir ” (Bombay and Persia S. N. C.) visited the ship in quest of information as to the approaches to the port of Jizan, his ship having been chartered by the Saudi-Arabian Govern ment to convey thither 700 troops from Jedda. 8. On the same day the Acting Commissioner called on the Commanding Officer in connection with suspicions of being engaged in the smuggling of Opium which were entertained by the Police against the Official Interpreter. The matter was fully investigated and the accusations proved to be based on a case of mistaken identity. The incident, however, served a useful purpose in impressing on the new Ship’s Company the gravity with which the Drug Traffic is regarded. 9. In this connection the campaigns of Russel Pasha in Egypt have now rendered the importation of drugs through the northern ports and on the north coast and across the western and eastern frontiers a far more risky undertaking than formerly, with the result that the Egyptian authorities have naturally turned their eyes towards the Sudanese frontier as being the obvious alternative for the development of new smuggling activities. This in turn has resulted in an even closer surveillance in Port Sudan, but although it is understood that no evidence has been found of an extensive entrepot trade, the opium traffic for local consumption has been proved to be on a considerably larger scale than was originally suspected. ****** * # * * Practice Areas. * * * * * • *49 If). Port Sudan .—On account of reports from the British Legation at Jedda of increasing tension between Saudi-Arabia and the Yemen on the ’Asir frontier, it was decided to sail one day in advance of programme, in order to call at Kamaran for further intelligence. The ship sailed accordingly at 17-00 on 19th September, and arrived at Kamaran at 12-30 on 21st. 17. Kamaran .—The Administrator, Captain Wickham at once came on board, hut had no further news to communicate. He felt certain that had hostilities commenced in the coastal area they would have come quickly to his knowledge from refugees, who in the prevailing northerly wind would soon have arrived from the Jizan-Medi district. Proceeded for Perim at 17-00 on the same day. 18. Pcrim .—Arrived at Perim 09-30 on 22nd September, 22. On the morning of the 25th the Sheikh (or ’Aqil) of Bir Suqaiya (a coastal village 13 miles North-east of Perim) called on the Commanding Officer to present a petition to the Chief Commissioner, Aden, in connection with the recent disturbances in that area. These events, in brief, consisted of raids and and my covering letter to the Chief Commissioner are shown in Appendix I. (12.53 North, 43.25 East) and carried out armed patrol by motor boat as far north as Dubbab (ZI) until dawn. 29. Weighed and proceeded at 06-00, and boarded two dhows—the first encountered during the period of the patrol—in the approaches to the entrance to Perim Small Strait. This scarcity of dhow traffic is attributable mainly to the tension existing between the Yemen and Saudi-Arabia, though trade in general is poor. 30. Passing through the Small Strait the ship anchored at 09-00 on 28th off Suqaiya 31. The Commanding Officer and Interpreter at once landed, and were received with great cordiality by the Sheikh, who had only just arrived back from Perim (paragraph 22), and villagers. No further developments had occurred in the district during his absence. A copy of my further Report to the Chief Commissioner, Aden, is shown in Appendix II. 34. Present in Aden was the Egyptian Government vessel Mabariss, which has been placed at the disposal of the John Murray Expedition. This expedi tion, under the Leadership of Lieutenant-Colonel R. B. Seymour Sewell, Sc. D. of the Indian Museum, Calcutta, is about to commence an extensive biological survey in the Western Indian Ocean, which will also include matters of more direct navigational interest. It is interesting to note that during their passage from Egypt the expedition anchored for three days in the Hanish Group, where they were* closely and some what abruptly questioned as to their business by the Italian Askaris on Jebel Zukur and Great Harish Island. It is understood, however, that their work was in no way impeded. Enclosure 2 to Serial No. (49). APPENDIX I. Enclosure to H. M.

Sir, I understand your honour is sailing this afternoon, and if you do not try and come to our shores and see our circumstances personally I shall come along with your honour also, if you would like to give me a lift. If the amberi chief of Sheikh- Said will take customs dues on dhows callings, then where are we to go as it would not be paving to dhowmen with their scanty freight that they get to call anvmore to Sokeiya, and besides this the Chief of Sheikh-Said closed the road for us, as to why we are in favour of British, but we know from our forefather that British rules from Aden to Sokeiya but the treats of the chief of Sheikh- Said makes us nervous, and we are in danger any time. I need not say more, and I leave it to your honour to judge this, and give us justice. Enclosure 3 to Serial No. (49). APPENDIX No. I. Enclosure to E. M. S. “ Penzance ’’—Report of Proceedings for the period 2nd September to 1st October 1933. Visit of ’Aqil of Bir Suqaiya. I have the honour to report that the ’Aqil of Bir Suqaiya visited H. M. S. “ Penzance ” this morning and presented the enclosed letter. It appears that he came to Perim on Saturday last with the intention ot seeking an interview with Mr. Sinclair, but was recommended instead to call on me. 2. I interrogated the ’Aqil with the object of elucidating his complaints, and gathered the following information :— {a) A small force of Yemeni troops at Sheik-Said forbid the passage of traffic from the Protectorate to Perim through that port. The ’Aqil had on this occasion made the entire journey by sea. (5) Since the visit of Lieutenant Hamilton to Suqaiya (about 14th instant) an armed Yemeni soldier appeared and demanded arrears of tax, in compliance with which 50 MT dollars were accordingly paid. (c) Five days ago, a further demand was made for camel and goat tax, but there being no money in the exchequer the envoy was told that payment must be deferred. 3. I could see nothing to be gained by visiting Suqaiya in the ship, and therefore told the ’Aqil that my programme would not permit of this deviation. If weather conditions permit, I propose to visit Suqaiya for a few hours on Thursday 28th September, while on passage to Aden. Enclosure 4 to Serial No. (49). APPENDIX NO. IT. Enclosure to E. M. S. “ Penzance ’’—Report of Proceedings for the period 2nd September to 1st October 1933. In amplification of my wireless message timed 12-40 of this date and in continuation of mv report No. 1115i6, dated 25th September, I have the honour to inform you that H. M. S. “ Penzance ” arrived off Bir Suqaiya at 09-00 this morning. 2. Accompanied by my Interpreter I landed immediately and was cordially received by Shiekh Ahmed Ali Fateh, who had himself only arrived one hour previously, in a Perim dhow. 3. No further developments in the situation in the village have occurred since the ’Aqil’s departure, neither is there any local intelligence of a recent51 reinforcement of the Tmanic troops at Sheikh Said, where a post of one Sergeant and six soldiers has been established for some time past. 4. In apparent contradiction to his written statement (enclosure to mv No. Ill5j6 of 25th September), the ’Aqil now states that Sheikh Ahmed A1 Ambari of Sheikh Said is friendly disposed towards him, and by agreeing to act as surety for the payment of taxes by the ’Aqil, has obtained the release from Mocha of the latter’s first cousin. This relative was presumably one of ^the twelve Subnisis referred to in Aden Political Intelligence Summary Ao. 344, paragraph 2479 (F. No. 2G-N.|33), as he was stated to have been initially in Am Nabia. 5. In accordance with your message timed 1310|27|9 I instructed the ’Aqil that he was to refuse payment of taxes, and was not to comply with any orders to proceed to Mocha. Should a tax demand be accompanied by a display of force 1 instructed him to repeat his previous protestations of complete penury. I further informed him that the Residency have the matter fully in hand, and will afford him all the support of which he may stand in need, adding that the Officer Commanding at T. A’id has been warned to withdraw and maintain his troops and tribesman within the recognised limits of the Yemen. 6. I feel confident that the ’Aqil’s peace of mind has to a large extent been restored, while the visit of H. M. Ship to his settlement cannot fail to reach the ears of the neighbouring Imanic authorities, with, it is hoped, beneficial results. Nonetheless there are two points which still becloud his outlook— (a) The paucity of his ammunition reserves, which amount to but twenty rounds among the ten rifles in his possession. (b) The restrictions on his actions imposed by the guarantee assumed on his behalf by the Sheikh of Sheikh Said. The cancellation of this surety would without doubt greatly strengthen his hand in resisting the imposition of taxes.

Telegram from His Majesty’s Charge d’affaires, Jedda, to the London Foreign Office, No. 182, dated the 27th October 1933. Jedda despatch No. 394, September 20th, 1932. I saw Minister of Finance this afternoon at his request when he gave me a verbal message from Ibn Saud through Amir Feisal to the effect that Maigret who returns from leave to-morrow recently met Fuad in Syria and requested permission to pay a personal visit to Nejd upon his return to Jedda. Fuad has now secured Ibn Sand’s consent and Maigret will proceed I understand imme diately thence here. Fuad will await him in Riyadh and will return with him to Hejaz. Minister of Finance emphasized that visit was purely private and would be short and gave as reason that Maigret merely wished to see the country. He would meet the'King either in Riyadh or in the neighbourhood. Abdullah Sulaiman added that should anything pass during visit other than private nature Fuad would inform me of it at our next meeting. I am at a loss to understand true (grp. undec.) of this strange departure from what has always been assumed would be the King’s attitude towards foreign representatives who desired to visit Nejd. It is difficult to accept pro testations as to private nature of visit at their face value and it is more than likely that other interpretations will be placed on the visit when the news becomes public property. Apart from its significance -as a meeting between the King and French representative at Riyadh and its possible fillip to French prestige it forms a precedent of which other foreign representatives including Soviet Minister might avail themselves. i Lc571FD—25—20-12-53—GIPSCONFIDENTIAL.

Colonel Hamdi Bey called and presented the compliments of the country. This officer fought in the'Great War as a Lieutenant in the Turkish Armv, ^anc is now the Director of Military Training for the whole Kingdom of Sa udi- Arabia. Though pleasant personally, it is difficult to imagine that he hits tins important post with much zeal or ability. His predecessor, a more efficient German-trained officer, was dismissed for corruption. 10. In the afternoon the Commanding Officer, accompanied by Mr. B. W. Seager (British pro-Consul) called on Sheikh ’Ali Taha and Sheikh Ah A1 Amari, respectively the Acting and Assistant Governors of Jedda in the absence of Sheikh Abdul Aziz ibn Mu’Ammar, who was engaged at Mecca m a matri monial venture. ’Ali Taha is a Hedjazi who has spent 25 years in Civil Service, firstly under the Turks, then under the Hashimite dynasty, and finally under the present Wahabbi regime. His colleague is a Nedji. The call of Colonel Hamdi Bey was then returned at the ez-Turkish barracks at the outskirts of the town. The building appeared to be scarcely occupied ; 2 armoured cars were observed in the central courtyard, but were evidently m a state of complete neglect. 11. The two Governors Returned the Commanding Officer’s call on Monday, 20th November, and were accorded a salute of 13 guns on their departure. Accompanied by the Mayor of Jedda (Sheikh Ali Salami) and Mr. Seager they lunched with the Commanding Officer on 22nd November. 12. Mr. K. S. Twitchell, the American Mining engineer, was in Jedda, having recently returned from El Hasa, where he had been assisting the Standard Oil Company of California in their prospecting operations, which (erminated in the grant of an oil concession by the Sau’dian Government. Mr Twitched made the journey across Arabia by car and lorry in seven days, and since Mr. Philby has now embraced Islam, it is probable that he is the only living Christian who has performed this feat. 13. As recently foreshadowed elsewhere, the affairs of Mr. H. St. J. B. Philby and his Sharqieh Company are by no means flourishing, and it seems that the terms of his concession for the importation of Ford cars and all motor tyres are proving financially unsound. Mr. Philby himself was on a business journey to Egypt. 14. It is understood that the large Soviet Legation, which holds itself much aloof from the European community, does little business, and pays no attention to the pilgrims from Russian territory. This may perhaps be due to the official anti-God podcy of- the Soviet, and in this connection it is believed that this attitude proves a definite commercial handicap when dealing with the Wahabbi Kingdom, founded as it is so largely on a fanatically religious basis. The same disability operates also in the Yemen. Lc49FDo # *'# # * * * *&gt; Sport. 16. Two football matches took place, the first against a team composed mainly of Javanese and the second against an Arab side ; the former was drawn, and the latter won by the ship, 2—0. Both games drew well behaved and enthusiastic crowds of between 2,000 and 3,000 spectators. Football made its first appearance in the Hedjaz about 2 years ago, and initiallv was banned, as it was thought that football clubs would become a cloak for political intrigue. The Government, however, was not long able to maintain this attitude in the face of the wave of popularity which the game attracted, particularly as it was strongly backed by the Amir Faisal, the Viceroy of the Hedjaz and second son of the King, who alone among the Royal House has visited Europe and acquired a smattering of western ideas. Rather is the game now encouraged in the belief, that, instead of criticisms of the Government, the relative merits of prominent players now provide the main topic of gossip in the bazaars. Whatever, may be the truth of this comforting theory, there can be no doubt as to the grip of the game on the popular imagination ; teams are springing up at Mecca as well as at Jedda, professionalism is beginning to show itself, and the days of the Sau’di Cup Final, transfer fees, gate money and other blessings of civilisation may not be far distant. ** ****** Throughout the stav, the hospitality offered on all sides was most marked and particularly at the Legation under Mr. A.'S. Calvert, the Charge d’Affaires, whose kindness in providing car conveyance and in assisting in water transport was of great assistance. ; i i I. I * i Political Situation. - _ ' 18 No marked change in the situation on the Yemen frontier has taken place The Imam has recently re-opened correspondence, by W.|T., asking King Ibn Sa’ud for the reason for his troop concentrations. The latter replied at length, re-stating his contentions and d'emands, re- questing a reasoned reply'to them, and suggesting a further meeting of delegates To this latter proposal the Imam readily agreed, but, typically, omitted all reference to Sau’dian claims. Once more Ibn Sa’ud pressed for a considered reply, and it was this strongly-worded communication which was incorrectly reported in a Cairo newspaper as constituting an ultimatum. 19 The concentration of troops and tribesmen continues, and is believed to be * nearing completion. It is reported in Jedda that the full quotas have not been forthcoming from many tribes, and that in the case ot a power!ul group in the North-West, Ibn Sa’ud has not felt himself strong enough to insist on the despatch of any forces. Bedouin who have never seen a white mah have recently passed through Jedda en route for the South.

Herr Borcliardt is acting on behalf of the Valend Import and Export Company of Amsterdam, which is, I believe, a German owned Company. 2 While in Bagdad he has, through the German Legation been put into communication with a certain Abdul Latif al Abdul Juld, wh^ whon m Ba^ad last Summer, represented himself to be authorised by King Ibn Sa ud to ne„o tiate the purchase of large quantities of arms and ammunition and also to dis- cuss proposals for oil and other concessions.3 3. According to my information Herr Borchardt is offering to the Govern ment of Sa’udi Arabia a light automatic weapon called the Schmeisser machine pistol, of which, it is claimed, 400,000 have already been supplied to the German army. Sample weapons are offered at 1,085 French francs, while for orders of 5,000 and upwards a price of 935 francs per weapon is quoted. 4. I understand that Herr Borchardt left Bagdad for Tehran early in December, leaving further negotiations in the hands of the German Minister here. 5.

Telegram from His Majesty’s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 227, DATED THE 30tH DECEMBER 1933. My telegram No. 216. French representative returned on December 21st. On December 27th he gave me to understand that object of his journey was to gratify his passion for travel. Next day Fuad told me in strict confidence which I promised to respect that although various popular rumours which I had heard were false Maigret had been asked to Riyadh to explain French attitude regarding matters raised by Saudi mission in Paris last year. These were facilities for obtaining war material and a loan as well as a mission to help with military organisation and air force. Fuad was vague as to stage which had been reached but implied that French were ready to oblige. He spoke of loan to be made by financiers and of a mission having civilian status but to be chosen under the auspices of the French Government. Despatch follows. ( 4 ) {Received on 28th January 1934, with Political Secretary’s letter No. 2, dated 11th January 1934.) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter, dated 8th January 1934. Letter p^rom His Majesty’s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 338, DATED THE 22nD NOVEMBER 1933. 1 have the honour to report that Talaat Harb Pasha, who is described in No. 45 of the List of Leading Personalities in Egypt, enclosed in Cairo despatch No. 68 of the 9th January, as a Senator and chairman of directors of the Banque Misr, is understood locally to be flying from Suez to Jedda, with stops at Wejh mid Yanbu, on or about the 2nd December, in a De Havilland Dragon aeroplane belonging to Messrs. Misr-Airwork ; a ground engineer sent by the latter to prepare the ground for landing arrived by steamer on the 19th November, and the agency work for it has been entrusted to Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co. (Sudan) (Limited), Jedda. 2. Talaat Pasha’s objects in this visit, which is not expected to exceed four days, are said to be threefold, viz., {a) to fix up local representation for the two pilgrim ships, which, I understand, have recently been purchased by the Egyptian Government for the conveyance of Egyptian pilgrims to and from the Hejaz ; {h) to organise the sale of Egyptian products in this country, in particular, the cotton goods which are said to be produced nowadays by a subsidiary company of the Banque Misr ; and (c) to explore the possibility of the Banque Misr opening a branch in Jedtla to assume the functions of a State bank for the Hejaz, in view of the apparent demise of the ex-Khedive’s project (see the correspond ence ending with your confidential despatch No. 266 of the 5th October). 3. To these objects may, perhaps, be added a fourth, namely, that of demon strating one of Misr-Airwork’s aeroplanes to Ibn Saud. You will recall that this company last year proposed to send an Avro to Jedda for this purpose (see the correspondence ending with the Acting High Commissioner for Egypt’s Saving-rum to you, No. 91 of the 19th August, 1932), but did not proceed with thescheme. Their object at that time was to sell Ibn Sand light military aircraft, and it seems probable that the recent reports of tension between him and the imam Yehya have led them to consider the moment opportune for a serious effort to this end*. Local gossip is rife on the subject, the establishment of an air /service between Egypt and Jedda being suggested in some quarters, whilst other and unkinder ones suggest that Talaat Pasha’s idea in arriving by air is to be able to leave the country quickly in the event of war with the Yemen materialising. 4. The aeroplane, if and when it arrives, will be the first machine of any sort to fly in or near the Hejaz since the ill-fated Wapiti, whose crash was reported in Mr! Hope GUI’s telegram No. 201 of the 14th September, 1931. Its arrival may serve to focus local attention on the parlous condition of the Saudi Air Force. The latter still consists of the four Wapitis and five old T). H. 9’s bought from His Majesty’s Government ; but the former, which alone might be made to tly, still remain, as they have remained since the time of the crash referred to above, in their ramshackle hangar, with absolutely no attention except an occasional greasing by an inexpert hand ; while Ibn Sand remains without a single pilot capable of flying the machines, and without a single competent air- mechanic. No attempt has been made to develop any ground organisation, and projects, which have been reported on various occasions from this post, of engaging Turkish pilots and|or training Saudi subjects in Turkey, have remained unrealised. 5. With Saudi finances till further depleted by the war-preparations, the scale of which is easily the greatest yet made, the prospects of Ibn Sand being able to afford the heavy and continuous expense of employing competent pilots and ground staff, and of his embarking upon the essential refitting of his present machines and the ground organisation necessary for any extensive flying, are receding further and further into the future. The prospects of his buying new machines seem even more remote, however, tempting the opportunity thus to steal a march on the Imam, unless the realisation of a State bank project should bring with it. a substantial loan or credit arrangements. The advent of a financier will, in any event, be awaited with no little interest in this country. 6. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Department of Overseas Trade and to his Excellency the High Commissioner for Egypt. (5) (Received on 11th February 1934. unth Political Secretary’s letter No. 4, dated 25th January 1934.) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter, dated 19th January 1934. Letter from His Majesty’s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 332, DATED THE 5tH DECEMBER 1933. Talaat Pasha Harb, whose anticipated visit to this country by air was reported in my despatch No. 338, Confidential, of the 22nd November [Serial No. (4)], duly arrived in Jedda on the 3rd December, accompanied by three others associated with him in this mission. He was met on the landing-ground close to the town, which for the previous two days had been the scene of con siderable activity, by the Amir of Jedda, a posse of local notables and a large concourse of the inhabitants. He had left Egypt on the 2nd December and had spent the night at Tor, where he had taken the opportunity of inspecting the quarantine station. He had resumed his journey on the 3rd,'had descended at Wejh, where a stay of some little time was made, and at Yanbu, where a short stay was necessarv for the purpose of refuelling. His pilot was Mr. G. J. Mahony, of Misr-Airwork, S. A. E. 2. It is still early to learn more than I was able to report in my despatch , under reference as to the objects of his visit and the measure of success he is likelv to achieve. I understand from mv Egyptian colleague that Talaat Pasha is pleased with his reception bv the Saudi authorities. Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman, the Minister of Finance, has been in Jedda during the past two days, and I learn that conversations have been proceeding at the Kandara Palace, where the members of the mission are being entertained as the guests of the Saudi Government. 3. Talaat Pasha, whom I met for a short time to-day, informed me that he proposed to leave for Mecca by car to-morrow and expected to return in two orthree days’ time. He would take to the air again on the 9th December for Yanbu, whence he intended to go to Medina by car, returning to resume his journey to Egypt from Yanbu two days later. 4. His visit has naturally received a good deal of local attention, and has, it is believed, excited considerable interest in Government circles. One is in clined to wonder how far Fuad Bey Hamza, during his leave, which was partly spent in Egypt, was instrumental in preparing the ground for this visit. At any rate, the obvious intention of Talaat Pasha is to create an impression as favourable to the objects he has in view as he possibly can. The D. H. Dragon aeroplane has been partly occupied since its arrival in carrying out short demonstration flights for the benefit of both European and native passengers. I am also informed by my Egyptian colleague that Talaat Pasha, to mark the occasion, brought with him a large selection of goods, probably of Egyptian manufacture, for distribution as charity to the poor of this _ country. It is pleasant to observe this pious practice, one of the five obligations of the true Moslem, going so happily hand in hand with, and sanctifying, a more material commercial purpose. I hope to be in a position to report further on this matter in due course. . * 4 5. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. Department of Overseas Trade, and to His Majesty s High Commissioner for Egypt. ( 6 ) (Received on 11th February 1934. with Political Secretary's letter No. 4, dated 25th January 1934.) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter, dated 17th January 1934. Letter from His Majesty’s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 351, DATED THE 5tH DECEMBER 1933. In my telegram No. 197 of the 15th November, I had the honour to indicate certain aspects of the local financial situation which might have a bearing on the Saudi attitude towards repayment of their debts. I submit herewith a somewhat fuller review of the situation. 2. All indications are that the Saudi Government are making the most determined efforts to reduce expenditure to a minimum and to lose no chance of ammenting their income, in order to leave themselves the widest possible margin for the heavy expenditure entailed by the military preparations^ now being undertaking. The latter are, of course, on a scale unparalleled &gt; m the history of this country, for tribal contingents from every quarter of Arabia have now been sent south,* together with all available munitions, including even such items as a batterv of field-guns from Medina brought in by the Turks before the Great War. The tribesmen receive little or no actual pay, but need equip ment food and transport ; a recent Mecca estimate nut the present expenditure under this head at £5,000 a day. The figure is doubtless exaggerated and will be reduced in any case once the armv has been transported to the required area, but even a tenth of this figure would be a sufficient drain on the Saudi income. To minimise it, the Government have recently taken to themselves importing such necessaries as paraffin, rice and sugar through certain old and trusted local firms such as Haji Zeinal AH Bidha, with whom tlm Mmistm of Finance has been in relations since his Bombay days. This practice has hit other merchants hard. ' 3 The revenue has diminished almost to vanishing point. As you are aware the bulk of it is derived from two sources, pilgrims and customs receipts. The pilgrimage of 1933, 20,000, was the worst since the inauguration of the Saudi regime, and the prospects for 1934 tend to suggest that little, if any, improvement can be looked for. At present three pilgrim ships have arnved from the Straits and Java, bearing exiguous cargoes of pil&lt;mms, and bookings are reported poor. The decline in the average value of pilgrims is moreover noticeable. Better-class and rich pilgrims are becoming rerer and the tendency seems to be more and more for the pilgrimage +o bo confined to peasants, wi bring with them the minimum sum necessary to do the pilgrimage m the cheapesi Lc49FD6 manner. This reduces the total of their purchasing power and with it that of the shopkeepers and other classes of Hejazi who live by them. 4. The decline in customs receipts cannot be measured, for no statistics are available, but must be considerable. The decreased number of pilgrims, the uncertainty of future numbers, the decline in the purchasing power of the people, the excessive increase of customs dues last May (see Jedda despatch No. 154) and the heavy stocks still held by local merchants as a legacy from the last eighteen months, have all contributed to the reduction of imports. Figures contributed privately by the Director of Customs are remarkable ; during the first eight months of the current Arabic year (April to November 1933) the number of packages imported through Jedda was 9,847, as compared with 48,735 during a similar period last year. * 5. Customs receipts are in any case heavily mortgaged by the system of drafts which the Saudi Government have adopted to an increasing extent in the last two years as a means of satisfying creditors without paying them. Fuad Bey Hamza told me on the _lst December that no such drafts had been issued since the beginning of the current Arabic year. My information suggests that this statement is not entirely accurate, and that certain favoured creditors, notably the importing firm mentioned in paragraph 2, have, in effect, received such drafts ; and that, moreover, these new drafts are “ 100 per cent.” ones, i.e., allowing the importer to admit goods free of all duty until the amount of the draft is paid off, instead of the “ 25 per cent.” once formerly issued which merely entitle him to write-off one-quarter of the amount of duty on each consignment while paying the remaining three-quarters in cash. In any case, the total of the drafts issued previous to this Arabic yegr and still unredeemed must be very large. The Soviets are stated to hold such drafts in respect of their 1931, importation of kerosene and benzine, but to be holding them, until such time as they can import with less certainty of loss. 6. All Government revenue is collected—one might say snatched—at the earliest moment and remitted to Riyadh. Forced loans on merchants, which were such a feature of the autumn of 1931, have not been in evidence, principally because of the lack of merchants rich enough to afford them, though this method was recently resorted to to pay Mr. Philby for a consignment of tyres. A tendency to impose new taxes, for example, on motor launches and on water- carts, is, however, noticeable. 7. Meantime other Government expenditure is cut down to the barest minimum. Official salaries are even more in arrear than usual ; for many months employees were being paid on the principle “ one-third cash, one-third kind, one-third carried forward,” but even this now been modified 1 to “ all carried.” Bribing is consequently even easier, cheaper and more prevalent than before. Money is refused for all kinds of necessary and even profitable expenditure ; the condenser engineer laments the lack of essential spares, and the piping necessary to supply Jedda with good water is not forthcoming. Even contingency allowances for Government offices have of late been held up. Redemption of debt, in such an atmosphere, seems the height of improbability. 8. The currency position reflects the general situation : the Saudi rial, which a year ago stood at 184 to the £ gold and two years ago at 174, is now fluctuating round 26. The value of its silver content is understood to be about 30 and, while at the moment it is showing a slight tendency to rise, as it does each year before the pilgrimage on account of the demand for it created by the arrival of pilgrims, the general opinion is that, after the pilgrimage, it will depreciate to nearly 30. 9. Despite the catalogue of depression in the preceding paragraphs, there is some reason to believe that the regime is in reality far from bankrupt and that its protestations of poverty are the result of Semitic cupidity and dislike of disbursement, far more than of actual lack of money. The Minister of Finance has been noticed to be far less worried than he might be expected to be and the Roval Familv still seem able to afford luxurv cars. The money, however, it is agreed, is not, in the Heiaz, but where it has been remitted so steadily and so long by the faithful Minister of Finance—Riyadh. 10.

M.’s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 355, dated the 9th December 1933. With reference to my despatch No. 285 of the 9th September regarding the Jedda water supply, I have the honour to report that the day of cheap and plenti ful water for Jedda now seems as far off as ever. 2. Sheikh Muhammad Dehlavi and the Waziria Committee are still at work at Waziria extending the old Turkish conduit farther back into the foothills in order to increase the head of water, which seeps into it from the subsoil, and a satisfactory flow of water into the town continues. They have, however, done nothing towards the renewal of the conduit near the town ; and it has now been established that the pipes in this portion, besides being rotten, are so full of the accumulated filth of ages that the water, which is reasonably pure at source, on arrival in the town contains almost every imaginable type of g'erm. Europeans here consequently eschew it, and even the native population, which is usually influenced by considerations of price a great deal more than by those of hygiene, fights shy. 3. It is estimated that an expenditure of £5,0(X) would suffice to repair the whole conduit, renewing the piping where necessary, and thus relieve Jedda of any future anxiety as regards water. The water runs from these wells to the town by gravity, and no pumping apparatus, not even the now derelict windmill pump introduced by Mr. Twitchell, is needed. An enterprising municipalitywould whole-heartedly support the scheme. But the Wazma Commiltee is lethargic. The all-powerful Minister of Finance is beheved to be hostile to the scheme because its fruition would necessitate the closing down of the condensers which at present supply the town and would thus deprive him of one small but certain source of revenue. The local merchants on the committee are far too much in awe of him to act effectively. Whilst, therefore, the yield of certain municipal taxes has been voted for furthering the scheme and there is some talk of a future levy on pilgrims, no efforts are being made to raise on adequate sum for the purpose, and the labours of the well-meaning Dehlavi seem doomed to be stifled through lack of funds. 4. 1 am sending a copy of this despatch to the Principal Secretai} of State for Foreign Affairs, Department of Overseas Trade. ( 12 ) {Received on 17th February 1934, with Political Secretary’s letter No. 5, dated 1st February 1934.) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter, dated 30th January 1934. Letter from H. M.’s Charge d’affaires, Jedda, to Foreign Office, No. 360, DATED THE 12tH DECEMBER 1933. With reference to my despatch No. 332 of the 5th instant [ Serial iSo. (5) ], relative to the visit of an Egyptian commercial and financial mission, under the leadership of Talaat Pasha Narb, to this country, I have the honour to report that the members of the mission left by air for Yenbu on the morning ot the 10th December, intending to journey by car thence to Medina and, returning the second day, to resume their flight to Egypt. 2 The programme followed whilst they were in this country conformed closely to that reported in my despatch under reference. Talaat Pasha Narb left Jedda bv car on the 6th December for Mecca, where he was entertained by Amir Feisal* Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman and Sheikh Abdullah-bin-Muhammad el- Fadhl, and returned on the 8th, when he dined with Mr. and Mrs. Philby. 3. The results of the visit, in so far as they are known, or partially known, may be stated under the following heads : (a) Bauque Misr.—l am informed by the manager of Messrs. Gellatly, Han key and Co. (Sudan) (Limited), that his firm have been given, for the time being, the agency of the Banque Misr as regards its purely banking business. Mr. Warner expressed the opinion, how ever, that it would not be long before the Banque Misr established a branch of their own in this country. {b) Local Representation for Pilgrim Ships.—It is understood that this has been given to the local firm of Messrs. Haji Abdullah Ali Kidha. It was stated on the 8th December that, although no written agree ment had at the time been signed, yet Talaat Pasha Narb had definitely promised the representation of this shipping interest to the local firm. Mr. Warner, in this connexion, stated that his firm had been given the handling of the money of Egyptian pilgrims, probably qua agents of the Banque Misr. (c) Pilgrimage by Air from Egypt .—It it believed that this question has received some consideration during the stay of the mission, though I am unaware of the result, if any. I have received the impression that the Saudi Arab Government have not proved very receptive to this idea. (d) Sale of Egyptian Products.—-I am not at present in possession of information on the activities of the mission in regard to the organisation of the sale of Egyptian products. The gratis distribu tion of such goods, to which I referred in my last despatch, was, I find, not confined to the poor alone, but was liberally used as com mercial ground-bait in business circles as well. 4. T am sending copies of this despatch to the Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Department of Overseas Trade, and to His Majesty’s High Commissioner in Cairo.

With reference to my despatch No. 325 of the 31st October and to_ my telegram No. 21G of the 10th December, relative to the visit of M. Roger Maigret, French Charge d’Affaires, to Ibn Saud at Riyadh, I have the honour to report that, as foreshadowed in my telegram under reference, my French colleague, who arrived back from leave on the 3rd Jlecember, left for Riyadh yesterday in a car provided by the Government in company with Haji Hamdi, the French-Algerian Vice-Consul and Fuad Bey Hamza. In my interview with the latter on the 10th December, he admitted that M. Maigret’s visit would not be of a purely personal and private nature as I was informed on the 27th October by Sheikh Abdullah Suleyman. Conversations would take place_ on matters of no^ great importance, except to the countries concerned, viz., Syria and Saudi Arabia, and would relate to trade and commercial questions affecting the two countries. Fuad Bey remarked that he expected to be absent in Nejd for about two weeks, but that on his return he hoped to be in a position to give Sir Andrew Ryan more information in regard to the objects of this visit. He also observed that M. Maigret ivas “ opening the door ” of Nejd to other visitors. 2. 1 understand that M. Maigret’s projected visit was known in Syria at the latest early in November, as the Indian vice-consul of this Legation, passing through Damascus about that time on his return from leave in Istanbul, found rumour very busy with the news. It was stated in some quartei s, that I e Avas ready to lend countenance to Ibn Saud in his present political difficulties, and the wildest conjectures were current according to which Italy and France were the “ backers ” of the Imam and Ibn Saud respectively in the present dispute, Great Britain, for once, being omitted from the picture. 3. It would be of great interest to learn in due course from His Majesty’s consular officers at Beirut and Damascus, to whom I am sending a copy of this despatch, whether any light, independent of the perhaps somewhat refracted information promised by Fuad Bey Hamza, can be thrown from Syria upon the inward reasons for this visit. Can there be among these matters of mutual commercial interest to the two countries the rather baffling problem of the market for thrones in Syria ?

I have the honour to inform you that the First Secretary of the Polish Lega tion called at the Residency yesterday with reference to the arrears of payment, amounting to thirty thousand pounds (£30,000), due by Ibn Saud to a Polish group in respect of anus and ammunition supplied in 1930.^ Monsieur Benis explained that the Saudi Government, having agreed to pay interest on the sum outstanding, appeared to intend to rest on this virtuous decision until the end ot time.2 He wished the Residency to know that a certain Monsieur Wilniewczyc, Professor at the Warsaw Polytechnic, had recently left for Jeddah, with a view to negotiating with the Saudi Government an early settlement of the Polish claim. He mentioned this to obviate any risk that distorted accounts of Monsieur Wilniewczyc’s mission or activities in Jeddah might reach you. Similarly, in order to obviate any misrepresentations from the Arab side, he had _ advised Monsieur Wilniewczyc to leave his card on you. No question of his invoking your assistance, however, arose. 3. Monsieur Benis was thanked for his communication. 4. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Foreign Office.

The Sa’udi Charge d’Affaires, Sheikh Ibrahim al Muammer, received his guests with kindly courtesy and was evidently gratified by the cordial congratulations which he received from all present. 3. The occasion was marked in the press by the publication of H. M.’s photograph and of laudatory leading articles praising his achievements. The Nationalist newspapers, such as “ Al Istiqlal ” and “ Al Uqab ”, rejoiced in him as the ruler of the one Arab country free from foreign domination, and heralded him as the keystone of the arch of the longed-for Arab liberation and unity. The Government organ, “ Al Tariq ”, struck a soberer and less tendencious note and was satisfied merely to indulge in neighbourly rejoicings with the people of Sa’udi Arabia on this happy occasion and to exhort the Governments of both countries to do their utmost to develop the common in terests of the two kindred nations. 4. Making due allowance for the irresponsibility of journalists, I think it may still safely be said that Ibn Sa’ud is a popular figure in this country and that the people have never shared or taken any live interest in the Hasimite feud with the House of Sa’ud. Most Iraqis respect Ibn Sa’ud for his personal achievements and for the honour which he has brought to the Arab race. The12 shortcomings of his administration of the Hejaz are, however, fully appreciated by the educated classes and they have no desire that he should extend his rule to this country. 5. 1 am sending a copy of this despatch to H.

Our despatch No. 20 of January 10th [Serial No .(15)]. We have now discovered the reason for the bouquets handed out by the vernacular press here to Ibn Sa’ud on the anniversary of his accession. 2.

We are sending a copy of this note to Jeddah. (17) {Received on 3rd March 1934, with Political Secretary^ letter No. 7, dated 15th February 1934.) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter No. E.-717|717|25, dated 6th February 1934. Lette from His Majesty’s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 6 (98|23]3), dated the 12th January 1934. With reference to previous correspondence ending with my despatch No. 172 (1611|134|20) of the 5th June last, relative to the constitutional evolution of this country, 1 have the honour to state that the Umm-al-Qura of January 5th con tained a short article on the subject of reports in the Egyptian press, of which 1 have no other knowledge, to the effect that Ibn Sa’ud proposed to separate certain part of his dominions, like the Hejaz and to place them “ under the supervision of one of the neutral Sherifs ”, the first of whom would be one of those living at Beirut. The Umm-al-Qura states that, as a result of inquiries in high official circles, it is authorized to deny this report categorically. The officials consulted pointed out the impossibility of any suggestion that the King would do anything to destroy the unity, which he has striven for thirty years to create. / 2. I have thought it worth while to draw your attention to this curious report and the emphatic contradiction with which it has been met. You will remember that early in 1926, Sherif Ali Hayder, the head of the principal branch of the Dhawi Zeyd, sought the assistance of His Majesty’s Government in securing the position of Regent or Governor of the Hejaz under Ibn Sa’ud and that at a rather earlier stage in the Sa’udi conquest of the Hejaz, it was suggest ed that Sherif Sharaf Adnan Pasha might be set up by the Ibn Sa’ud as ruler of the Hejaz. Little has since been heard of the ambitions of Sherif Ali Haydar and his sons Sharaf Adnan, who entered the employment of Ibn Sa’ud, has sunk into obscurity in Mecca. Whatever his relations with these people, it is to my mind almost inconceivable that he should willingly place any of the Sherifian family in any position of ^Masi-independent authority. 3. 1 had already drafted the first two paragraphs of this despatch, when I received a copy, kindly sent to me by Sir H. Satow of his despatch to the Foreign Office No. 119 of December 16th, regarding the Sherif Ali Haydar and his son Abdul Majid. It looks as though that family were letting off a little flight of ballons d’essai. The ambitions of the son, wdio is or was married to a daughter of his namesake the last Turkish Caliph, are no new thing. &lt;IHe used to ventilate them freely at the Embassy in Constantinople during the period following the Armistice with Turkey. I was on terms of friendship with both father and son at that time, but have had no recent communication with them, except that Sherif Abdul Majid sent me ti Christmas card soon after my arrival here. I acknowledged as briefly as politeness would permit. 4. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s High Commissioner at Cairo and His Majesty’s Consul-General at Beirut. A13 3 .

However, the Hejaz Government had made a proposal by which a part or total payment of the £30,000 would be made pro vided the Polish group in question would supply the Hejaz Government with luither arms and ammunition, smaller in quantity than the previous order. 2. Monsieur Ben is enquired whether we would have any objection to the conclusion of an agreement on the above lines. He was reminded that the Resi dency was not responsible for Hejaz affairs which were within your competence. He said that he understood that this was the case, but that,'as there was no . * °hsh repiosentative at Jedda and as he had to make some sort of report to his Government, he was anxious to ascertain, if possible, our views beforehand. Phe Oriental Secretary thanked him for his courtesy and, while reaffirming that * Hejaz matters were not within the competence of the Residency, expressed the private opinion that the proposed transaction was a business one on which we were not called to express an opinion. 3. To-day Monsieur Benis rang up the Oriental Secretary and informed that Monsieur Wilniewczyc had just arrived from Jedda and was verv pessimist ic at the possibility of getting anything at all out of the Hejrz Government. He was, however, submitting to his principals the proposals made by the Hejaz Government on the lines indicated in paragraph 1 above. He seemed to think, however, that there was not much chance of the deal being concluded. (19) {Received on 3rd March 1934, ici+h Political Secretary’s letter No. 7, dated 15th February 1934.)

( 22 ) (Received cm 10th March 1934 with Political Secretary's letter No. 8, dated the 22nd February 1.934.) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter dated 19th February 1934. Letter from II. M.’s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 371, dated the 30th December 1933. In my telegram No. 227 of to-day’s date [Serial No. (3)1, I have summed up briefly my conversations with my French colleague and Fuad Bey Hamza regarding the visit of the former, in the company of the latter, to Riyadh. It may interest you to have a fuller account of this episode. 2. As reported in Mr. Calvert’s despatch No. 359 of the-12th December [Serial No. (13)], M. Maigret and Fuad Bey started on the 11th December, two days before my own return to Jedda. They reached Riyadh on the morning of the 15th December and left again on the 18th December, getting back to Jedda {ind Mecca respectively on the 21st December. 3. M. Maigret lay very low, as his custom is, until the 27th December. On that day a telephone message from me asking whether he had returned elicited •the offer of a visit. When he came, he first gave me some interesting general impressions. He contrasted Sana, a place where one merely got back to the Middle Ages, with Riyadh, which might be a Babylonian city of 5,000 or 6,000 years ago all sun-dried bricks and silence, in a setting of illimitable desert. 4. I observed presently that M. Maigret’s journey had been the subject of much comment. In order to draw him out, I cited, half-jestingly, the rumours that a Saudi prince was to sit on the Syrian throne, that negotiations regarding the Hejaz Railway were in progress, or that France was intervening in the quar rel between Ibn Saud and the Imam Yahya. 5. M. Maigret endorsed my own sceptical comments on rumours so fantastic and proceeded to tell me, with an air of great frankness, what he represented as the whole truth. He had a passion for visiting out-of-the-way places. He had a great sympathy for this country. He intended to write a book. His Government had authorised him to go to Riyadh, and he had gone there on the invitation of Ibn Saud. He had undoubtedly talked politics with the King, but only European politics. France had no political interest in Arabia, except in so far as her position in Syria raised certain questions, e.y., in regard to tribes, and intensified her concern with Moslem affairs. His Government alwavs impressed on him the necessity for a discreet avoidance of mixing up in Arabian politics. And so on and so on, for a pleasant hour or more. 6. It is quite true that M. Maigret, who hardly leaves his house while in Jedda, has a great taste for distant travel in the East. I had been prepared, for this reason and because I do not believe him to “ cut much ice ” with his own Government, to discount the importance of his trip to Riyadh. Nevertheless, his statement left one thing unexplained, namely, why the Saudi Government had authorised the visit. The ban on non-Moslem access to Rivadh has been slightly relaxed this year, witness the recent visit of Mr. 'Twitchell, but the reception tho^o of any foreign diplomatic representative is a portent. LclOGFD16 7. On the 28th December Fuad Bey came to see me for the first time since my return/ Our first subject of conversation was M. Maigret’s adventure. I trotted out the same three rumours, with much the same comments as before, and added a vague reference to suggestions that the French Government might be prepared to give some kind of material assistance to Ibn Baud. Fuad Bey expatiated on M. Maigret’&amp; love of travel, his desire to write a book and his great friendliness towards this country and Islam. He dealt systematically with my collection of rumours. There was no present question, he said, of a Saudi candidature for the Syrian Throne. There could be no such question so long as the French were committed to a policy in Syria which turned out on its having a republican constitution, and any modification of which would raise complicated questions, among them that of securing the assent of the League of Nations. If the Saudi Government reopened the question of the Hejaz Railway, as they had it in their minds to do, they would approach His Majesty’s Government in the first instance. All that had happened so far was that his own replies to interviewers in Egypt had had a repercussion in Syi^a, where he had been asked many ques tions and been led to engage in very general conversations of an informal kind. He dismissed more briefly any idea of French intervention in the quarrel with the Imam. 8. Fuad Bey went on to say that there was, none the less, a business side to M. Maigret’s journey. After obtaining my promise that what he was about to say would be regarded as highly confidential, he explained that when he was in Paris with the Amir Feisal in the spring of last year, certain questions had been broached. Conditions in Paris made it impossible to pursue them at that time. The French had tried later to communicate with him at The Hague and Berlin, but he was already in Moscow when they got into touch with him. Skipping a long interval, he said that eventually the French Government had charged M. Maigret to communicate their views on the desiderata put forward by the Saudi mission last year. They related to war material, a loan and a mission to help with military organisation and the Saudi air force. It had been decided to invite M. Maigret to convey the French reply to the King at Riyadh. 9. Fuad Bey was much less precise as to the messages which my French colleague had brought. His language generally, rather than any definite state ment, implied that the negotiations were approaching a happy close. As I have stated in my telegram under reference, he mentioned financiers, and not the French Government, as the providers of the prospective loan, and he said that the mission, though recruited under the auspices of the French Government, would be of a civilian character. 10. Fuad Bey assured me more than once that these dealings with the French implied no departure from his Government’s policy of friendship with His Majesty’s Government. He reminded me lightly and amiably of their failure to obtain from British sources the help they needed. I said that we could not criticise the action of the Saudi Government in cultivating French friendship, and begged him to believe that my desire for information was inspired by interest and noVby jealousy. I did not comment otherwise on his statement, except for a passing remark, when he mentioned the proposed military mission, that I thought the Saudi Government had been looking to Turkey about a year ago for this kind of assistance. Fuad Bey replied, with a slight and perhaps unintentional lapse from strict accuracy, that there had only been a question of sending young men to be trained in that country. 11. Assuming Fuad Bey’s explanation to have been generally in accordance with the facts, and he was not only more precise but also more convincing than my French colleague, it remains to be seen what advantages the French Government expect in return for their benevolence. I have no means of obtaining information on this subject. My general view is that there will be little reason for perturba tion, even if the negotiations do in fact produce concrete results. Despite my regard and admiration for Ibn Sand, I have still to discover that, in his dealings with European Powers or commercial interests, he ever gives much that is solid or of durable value for what he receives. I have never thought, for instance, that a power providing an air force can hope for much of a “ cinch ” on the air of Saudi Arabia. 12. I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s representative in Paris and His Majesty’s consular officers at Beirut and Damascus.{Received on 10th March 1934 with Political Secretary’s letter No. 8, dated the 22nd February 1934.) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter dated 19th February 1934. Letter from H. M/s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 16 (172|124|3), ' dated the 23rd January 1934. With reference to mjr telegram No. 2, saving of January 11 [Serial No. (8)], I have the honour to state that on January 22, Mr. Philby related to me in eonfidence a conversation he had recently had with Abdul-HamitL Bey Shedid about his new proposals for the creation of a State Bank in this country. Shedid stated that he was now representing J. S. Bartho lomew and Company, a firm with an address in (?) Berkeley Square, who had formed a company under the name of the Hejaz Development Company, with a small capital of which £15,000 was paid up. The registration of this company was so recent that Shedid had only heard by telegraph after his arrival here on January 9 that the formalities had actually been completed. He gave the names of certain directors, but as Mr. Philby was not sure of these and as we could not identify two knightly names, which he thought he remembered, I refrain from reproducing them. Indeed I would ask you to regard all the details in this despatch as being open to doubt, as I write from memory of what Mr. Philby told me from his own memory of a conversation. 2 The promoters hoped, according to Shedid, to interest considerable per- sonsln London, like Viscount Goschen (Westminster Bank), Lord Glenconner, Sir E Mountain (presumably the insurance magnate) and a Mr. Brown of Andrew Weir and Company. He did not, however, represent their support as assured. 3 The scheme propounded by Shedid was to create a Bank on the same lines as those projected, when he was'acting or professing to act for the e^-Khedive ast vear, with the exception that the loan of £200,000 gold was to be paid in two parts i e., £50,000 when the concession was granted and the balance at some later date ’ The group sought in return various concessions including the construc tion of a port at Jedda, the reconditioning of the railway to Medina, road-build ing and any other industrial objects which might be available, e.g., gold-mining. 4 Mr Philby is one of those who were deceived by Shedid last year and were disappointed of the hopes to which he gave rise. His present attitude, therefore, is one of interest combined with much scepticism. He said he had told Shedid that he could not wonder, if on this occasion he found the Sa’udi Government anxious to be assured of his credentials before they entertained hia proposals, though the proposals seemed in themselves attractive enough. He returned a guarded answer when Shedid asked whether he, Mr. Philby, himself believed in him. 5. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Department of Overseas Trade and to the Acting High Commissioner at Cairo. (24) (Received on 17th March 1934 with Political Secretary’s letter No. 9, dated the 1st March 1934.) / Enclosure in Foreign Office, covering letter dated 22nd February 1934. Memorandum No. 58 (169|1|34), dated the 9th February 1934. His Majestv’s Minister at The Hague presents his compliments to the Sec- retarv of State'for Foreign Affairs and, with reference to the Hague despatch No 423 of December 18, 1933, has the honour to report that the acts of ratifica tion of the Treaty of Friendship between the Netherlands and Yemen, of March 12th, 1933, were exchanged at San’a on the 4th February 1934. 2. In accordance with article 5 the treaty entered into force for the Kingdom of the Netherlands in Europe immediately after the exchange of the acts of ratification.18 (25) {Received on 17th March 1934 with Political Secretary’s letter No. 9, dated the 1st March 1934.) Enclosure in Foreign Office, covering letter, dated 22nd February 1934. Letter from H. M.’s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 20 (189|106|3), dated the 25th January 1934. My attention has been drawn to the desirability of elucidating the facts con nected'with the alleged murder of certain Sa’udi state prisoners, including Ibn Hithlain and Ibn Lami, in view of the rumours reproduced in recent Kuwait In telligence Summaries, notably that for October. As you are aware, I have no means whatsoever of investigating such a matter here but when Mr. Calvert drew mv attention to the reports on my return from leave, I agreed with him that they deserved careful attention. I may say, however, with great deference to Colonel Dickson's greater knowledge of Arabian life, that I thought it un likely that Ibn Sa’ud would break his word in a matter of this kind and equally unlikely that he would challenge the hostility of important sections of the Ajinan, Mutair and Ateyba tribes at a time when he was so deeply embroiled in his difficulties with the Imam Yahya. 2. In these circumstances, I decided to put a straight question to Fuad Bey Hamza as soon as I could do so orally. I told him on December 29th, that, while I did not normally attach importance to such rumours, those regarding the three prisoners in question were so positive and so persistent as to ^uo-gest malicious invention or distortion of something that had happened. I wa's' not myself, I said, ready to believe that the King would authorise the execution of men whose lives he had pledged himself to respect. On the con- trarv I was concerned, as a friend, for His Majesty s credit and prefered to inquire at once in that capacity rather than await instructions to investigate the matter as being one of legitimate interest to His Majesty’s Government. 3 Fuad Bev reminded me, quite justly, that the King’s pledge did not applv to Ibn Humaid (Sultan ibn Bujad) whose name I had mentioned with the others. He begged me to believe that the King was incapable of breaking his promise but he undertook to inquire into the facts. On January 19th he con- veved to me the King’s assurance that Ibn Lami and Ibn Hithlam were alive, and told me in reply to an inquiry, which I expressly put as a matter ot curiositv that Ibn 'Bujad was also alive. Having received m the meantime Colonel'Dickson’s report for December, which cast doubt on the original murder story I said to Fuad Bey that I now had reason to believe^ that the three Shevkhs had been removed to Hofuf and thought that this might have given rise to the first reports. Fuad Bey promised to inquire further. On January 94 th when I reverted to the matter, he renewed the King s asurrance that the men were alive but said that His Majesty begged to be excused, for reasons of internal policy, from disclosing their whereabouts. 4 I do not feel that I can pursue the matter further, unless you consider that the precise nature of the treatment of Ibn Hithlain and Ibn Lami is a matter of such moment to His Majesty’s Government as to justify them m call- the King to account for his harshness, on the strength of rumours, which, however probable, cannot be proved. Such action might outrage him so great as to produce a definite coolness between him and His Maiesty s Goiemment. j am not myself in favour of it and I do not think it would in any way help the two Rhevkhs. I cannot doubt the King’s formal assurance that the, aie a • T have little doubt that they have been m fact removed to Hofuf and I believe Tim Tiluw-i the Governor of Hasa, to be a cruel gaoler, but 1 do not think that even Tbn Jiluwi would murder these men in defiance of the King. In my opinion what I have already done will at least suffice to remind Tbn . n ml tha I [is Majesty’s Government are not indifferent to the fate of Ibn Hithlain and Ibn Lami. . 5 I took an opportunity in the course of my conversahons with Fuad Bev Hamza of suggesting that the King might well, after this lapse of relax his severity and treat these prisoners m the s «nae way as many others who ore kept under a sort of open arrest at Riyadh. I cannot be sure In Fuad Bey would pass this on to the King but T think the best hope for these mi fortunate men is that, when his present troubles are ended, Ibn Sa ud _ 1 ' 'omewTa' He has already shown signs of anxiety to disarm hostility- I 'T V id J 19 among the Ajman and Mutair. As for Ihn Hnmaid, Fuad Bey told me spon taneously that appeals had been made to the King on his behalf but had net been successful. He added that Ibn Humaid was not really bad-hearted but rather a simple soul. I recalled the time when he had been so good a servant that he had been one of the conquerors of Mecca. b.

Letter from His Majesty’s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 23 (226 61|6), dated the 29th January 1934. I received on January 28, a despatch from His Majesty’s Commissioner in Egypt, No. J of January 13, in which he was good enough to pass on to me certain information irom the Polish Legation in Cairo regarding the visit of a certain Monsieur M ilniewczyc to Jedda. A copy of this despatch has been sent to you direct and you may perhaps be interested to recerbe such further particulars as I can give. 2 . Monsieur M ilniewczyc in fact arrived in Jedda on or about January 8, and, although he did not call on me, I met him the next evening at a dinner given bv Mr. Philby, whose guest he was, in honour of the Amir Feysal. He left a week or ten days later, having in the meatime conferred with the Minister of Finance. 3. You are aware of the circumstances connected with the arms and ammuni tion imported by Ibn Sa’ud from Poland in the ss.“ Cracow ” in 1930. Half the bill was paid at the time but half remained outstanding. The figures given then and now do not quite tally but Mr. Philby confirms Sir M. Lampson’s informa tion that the balance due is £30,000, meaning, I think, £30,000 gold. I gather that the suppliers were a consortium of Polish arms factories, in which the Polish Government are interested. They have tried more than once to get paid, always without success. 4. According to Mr. Philby, the Sa’udi Government are now desirous of obtaining a very large quantity of arms and ammunition from the same group. He told me a few days ago in one of our usual confidential conversations that M. AVilniewczyc had taken away with him for submission to his principals a pro posal that, in consideration of receiving £7,000 or £8,000 as a payment on account of the old debt, the Poles should supply further aims, etc., to the value of £100,000. The aggregate of this new debt and the balance of the old would then be paid off in instalments by means of irrevocable drafts on customs. I gather from earlier conversations with Mr. Philby that there may also be a question of reorganising the Government workshop at Mecca but he has not recentlv men tioned this. I also gather that Sharqieh Limited would come into the business in some way, presumably as agents. 5. I cannot be certain whether the above second or third hand account of what is proposed is accurate. Personally I think that the Poles would be fools to embark on so risky a transaction but much would depend on the nature of the drafts on customs. If they took the shape of orders to pay periodical sums out of current revenue, the business, though still risky, might be worth considering. If, however, they took the more usual form of drafts to be accepted in payment he -} 06 FD20 or part payment of duty on goods imported by the holders, it would take the Poles a very long time to get their money back. Should the deal go through the question will arise whether the arrangements do not involve preferential treat ment of the kind referred to in the recent correspondence relative to His Majesty’s Government’s claims against the Sa’udi Government.

I offered to see him in the evening or any time in the course of the following two days. 2. Sheykh ‘Abdullah Suleyman would hear of no delay and came to Jedda the same afternoon. When he called I first explained that it was unusual for His Majesty’s Government to tender advice in such cases, but that you had autho rised me to make two statements on the understanding that the Saudi Govern ment would regard the matter as strictly confidential. I then conveyed to him the substance of the second sentence of your telegram under reference [Serial No. (21)], and 3 r our telegram No. 15 of February 7th [Serial No. (19)]. 3. In the conversation which ensued I added as from myself that Sheykh ‘Abdullah knew more about Shedid than I did but that in my opinion the Saudi Government would do well to use great caution. I suggested that they ought to be able to obtain any further information they needed through the Saudi Minister in London. Sheykh ‘Abdullah said that he did not think they need seek any further information in view of what I had told him on behalf of His Majesty’s Government. He expressed great gratitude. 4. 1 am sending a copy of this despatch to the Department of Overseas Trade. (29) {Received by Air Mail under P.Z. 1902\1916 34.)

So far as I am aware. His Majesty’s Government have consistently held since that time no exception could be taken to the importation of war material Ibn Sand from any source.

With reference to the telegraphic c orrespondence referred to in Foreign Office telegram No. 33 (as repeated to Bagdad) of the 21st February, I have re ceived to-day a letter from King Ibn Sa’ud, a translation of which I enclose. This letter is in reply to an ordinary friendly letter of mine thanking His Majesty for his signed photograph, which he was kind enough to send me. In King Ibn Sa’ud’s letter I see no trace of a charge of unfriendly behaviour on the part of Iraq towards him, rather the contrary, and as His Majesty has been in the habit of writing to me with the greatest frankness, I do not think he would have hesitated to voice a complaint if he was nursing a grievance at the time of writing the letter, which, you will observe, is dated the 5th February.

It is a cause of pleasure for me, as it is for you, that our relations with Iraq are progressing so friendly and amicably. At the same time we recall that to Your Excellency goes the greatest credit for reaching this result, which has yielded happy and useful fruit for the two countries and has given pleasure to all Arabs and also to all friends of the Arabs. It is a source of comfort to us to have, in Your Excellency’s person, such a friend in that good Arab country with whom we may constantly exchange sen timents of friendship and love. We reiterate our thanks for the good wishes and kind hopes you have expressed in regard to certain difficulties confronting as in the South, and hope that, God willing, these difficulties will end peacefully.

I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your very confidential Despatch No. 54 (E. 847j72|25) of February 8 relative to the persons concerned in the most recent scheme for creating a State Bank in this country. I had already received your telegram No. 22 of February 22 [Serial No. (27) ]. 2 . I have not so far taken any action on either of these papers, as I. prefer not to seek a special interview with the Minister of Finance. I consider that, if the Saudi Government are walling to be warned, what I told the Minister on Februarv 11 should convince them of the need for the utmost caution. Ihey have also prohablv been warned by Mr. Philby, who tells me that he has had very unfavourable reports from London on the parties concerned m the Hejaz Development Corporation Ltd. 3. Should I have an opportunity of speaking again to the Minister of Finance, I will carry out the instructions in your telegram No. 22 ot February 22 but will use great caution in regard to the detailed information given &gt;y the Deuartment of Overseas Trade. I am somewhat disquieted, however, to learn that the Department has doubts as to the confidence which would be inspired in financial circles bv the persons named m the second sentence of my telegram No 13 of Januarv 25. I fear that I myself regarded those persons as being of miquestionaWo standing in the business world and that in my conversations with Sheykh ’Abdullah Suleyman, I urged the importance ot making sure that the Corporation had really got their backing rather than the importance of invest,i- gating their titles to confidence. 4 Mr Pbilby mentioned one point of interest which I gather he had learnt in Saudi circles ' . This was that Sheykh Hafiz Wahba had been in touch with a Mr. Beckett, who is, I understand, the Chairman of the Westminster Bank. 5. ’Abdul Hamid Bey Shedid left Jedda on February 21.

No dhows were met. At this time of the year, due to weather conditions dhow traffic practically ceases in the Southern end of the Rod Sea except, for coastal trade inside the reefs. Trade in dates from the Persian Gulf, which is considerable, has only just commenced and cargoes are conveyed in larger dhows than are usualy en countered in this locality. •j. Aden. — Arrived at Aden on 12th December preparatory to embarking ihe Mission proceeding to Sana via Hodeida with the object of negotiating a treaty with the Imam of the Yemen. 6. The Resident embarked at 08-25 on 15th December and was saluted by the shore battery on leaving Prince of Wales Pier and again on arrival on board when his personal flag was broken at the force. ******** 7. Hodeida. —Bad weather was experienced after passing Perim and the passengers, without exception, were glad to reach Hodeida. A national salute was fired on arrival and returned immediately by the shore battery, whose gun. Brill was a distinct improvement on the last visit. (November 1932.) The ship was met by a deputation headed by the Governor of Zediya w r ho came on board to welcome the Mission on behalf of the Govemor.sV 4 % * * * * * * 26 8 . At 15-30 the Resident disembarked accompanied by the Commanding: Officer and Aide-de-Camp and was accorded a salute of 13 guns following which his flag was struck. ******** 9 . The Resident was received by the principal officials and a large guard and band (the latter in uniform) ; also by the majority of the populace who had assembled in their best attire at every available point of vantage. He was conducted to a house near the landing place which had been specially prepared for his accommodation and the party was introduced to the Governor of Hodeida, Saif-al-Islam Abdullah, a younger son of the Iman. Abdullah is aged about nineteen, of slight build and unprepossessing in ap pearance which is accentuated by a receding chin and an attempt to grow a beard ; his eyesight is presumably weak as he wears glasses. After welcom ing tbe Resident on behalf of the Iman and ordering refreshments he had little to say although Colonel Reilly speaks Arabic fluently. 10. The Mission consists of :— Lieutenant-Colonel B. R. Reilly, C.I.E., O.B.E., Chief Commissioner, Resident and Commander-in-Chief of Aden, and appointed His Majesty’s Commissioner and Plenipontentiary to the Iman of the Yemen. Mr. R. S. Champion, Political Secretary, Aden. Lieutenant the Hon’ble R. A. F. Hamilton, Aden Protectorate Levies, A. D.

Operators, Aden Protectorate Levies. 1 Medical Officer (Indian). 3 Personnel servants and 1 cook. 11. Mr. Champion, Political Secretary, in whose hands all the preparatory work had been ably accomplished was unable to travel at the last moment owing to illness. He is an experienced Arabic Scholar and his absence would have been greatly felt by the Mission. He was, however, able to join the Mission later, flying to Kamaran, thence by dhow to the Mainland and motor car to Sana. 12 . A portable R. A. F. W.|T. set was carried by the Mission and communi cation established with Aden shortly after arrival at Sana. It had also been hoped to obtain permission from the Iman for aeroplanes to land at Sana and thus maintain more direct touch, but this was refused. 13. The Resident arranged to leave for Sana at 07-00 on the following morn ing, stopping for one night on the way. The road has recently been improved and the journey can actually be done in a day. The negotiations were expected to take until towards the end of January it was not thought that much would be accomplished until after expiration of Ramadan 16th January. Proceeded at noon on 17th December, information having been received that the Mission had started their journey according to plan—a creditable feat in an Arab country on the part of the Transport Officer. Before sailing generous gifts of bullocks, sheep, chickens, pigeons, fruit, coffee and vegetables were received—a present from the Imanic Government and a suitable letter of thanks sent. ******** 16. Political .—It is understood that the situation between Tbn Sa’ud and the Tman is improving and reported that they are again exchanging telegrams.

Ibn Saud had also asked the Polish consortium to supply him with aeroplanes, and to reorganise the Government workshop. 2. Mr. Benis again asked whether the Polish consortium would do well to accept this offer and was again informed that the matter was not one in which • we could advise him. 3. He professed anxiety to do nothing which might embarrass His Majesty’s Government whose paramount interests in Arabia he recognised, and said that if His Majesty's Government preferred that no arms or aeroplanes should be supplied to Ibn Sand the Poles would not supply them. Was there, he en quired, any risk that, if the Polish arms-manufacturers accepted the Saudi terms, Sir Andrew Ryan would oppose the settlement 1 Mr. Benis was re minded that Sir Andrew Ryan had a certain number of British dept claims against the Saudi Government to sponsor, the settlement of which he would not wish anything to prejudice. 4. Mr. Benis took this point at once and stated that he would recommend his Government to enquire of your Department whether Polish acceptance of the Saudi Government’s conditions would in any way embarrass His Majesty’s Government. If so, the consortium would be advised against acceptance. 5. I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s Minister in Jeddah.

Later the date was further postponed to 3rd February and it was possible to carry out a modified cruise as far as Mukalla.From information received, it is believed that the treaty negotiations with the Iman have been entirely successful and Colonel Reilly is only waiting for evacuation of Protectorate Territory by the Iman’s followers before signing the treaty. The evacuation is going forward though more slowly than was expected. An amusing report was received at the Residency from the Political Clerk (Arab) at Hodeida, announcing that on successful completion of the negotiations the Iman ordered his band to play “ all day ” outside Colonel Reilly’s house “ much to the inconvenience of the Russian and Italian Consul who lived next door.” He did not express Colonel Reilly’s views, but these may be left to the imagination. * * #.# * * • • 9. Mukalla. —Proceeded for Mukalla early on 26th January, carrying out six monthly full power trial a. m. and arriving the following day in a mild sand storm. His Highness the Sultan of Shihr and Mukalla was in residence but in disposed and suffering from a cold. He sent his Wazir, Seyyid Bubakar Husein to present his compliments with a request that calls should be dispensed with and invited the Commanding Officer and two Officers to tea. The Sultan is partially of Indian descent and has estates in Hyderabad where he spends most of his time. He is a large unhealthy looking individual reputed to take little interest in improving Mukalla while converting most of the revenue to his own use and is naturally unpopular with his subjects. **&gt;***••• 13. Political Situation. — Saudi-Arabia-Yemen. Further conference of Saudi-Arabian (headed by Fuad) and Yemeni delegates is probable and should take place about middle of February. While outbreak of hostilities at any moment is feared by the Saudi Government, con fidence in a peaceful solution is expressed by the Iman’s Ministers. Owing to suspicious attitude of Yemenis, Saudi troops have advanced to Samta in Asir and have fortified mountain posts. Military preparations are continuing on both sides. Sana Mission (see paragraph 8). Evacuation of Aden Protectorate Territory is slowly being effected and it is improbable Mission will be ready to leave Hodeida before 14th Febur^y at the earliest. • * • » v- • • • (45) Enclosure in Colonial Office covering letter, dated the 6th April 1934.

We have sent you officially in our letter No. E.-2104|72-25 of the 17th April a copy of Ryan’s confidential despatch No. 76 (737il24|18) of the 20th March regarding a project for a bank in Saudi-Arabia which has been started by a certain Mr. Abdul Ghani Ydlibi. Ydlibi is a British subject of Syrian origin who is head of a small company in Manchester. We had some dealings with him in 1932 when he was attempting to form a syndicate in order to prospect in oil and minerals in the Hejaz. His prospects were thought by the Department of Overseas Trade to be poor and he himself did not inspire confidence. Beside the bank project referred to in Ryan’s despatch, he is now attempting to secure from Ibn Saud an oil concession in the neutral zone between Koweit and Saudi- Arabia on behalf of a syndicate, some at any rate of the members of which are also connected with the Eastern and General syndicate. 2. He apparently expects to obtain the support of a British bank for his own bank scheme. If you should learn anything of any moves in this country con nected with the latter project, we should be glad to know of them and we should of course 'welcome any observations you may wish to offer on Ryan’s despatch. 3. I am sending copies of this letter to Farrer at the Department of Overseas Trade, Blaxter at tlie Colonial Office and Laithwaite at the India Office. (47) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter, dated 17th April 1934. (Received on 5th May 1334 } with Political Secretary’s letter No. 16, dated 19th April 1934.) Letter from His Majesty’s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 67 (666jl24jl6), dated the 13th March 1934. ;■ , With reference to my despatch No. 56 of February 27 [Serial No. (33)], I have the honour to state that l had occasion to call on the Saudi Minister of Finance on March 11 and took the opportunity of speaking to him further about the Hejaz Development Corporation, Ltd. I said that the further informa tion I had received since our last interview added little that was material to, what I had then told him, but that it certainly confirmed the view that .the com position of the Corporation was not such as to inspire much confidence. I then explained that the registration of a company in England was a mere formality, by which any group of persons could invest themselves wfith a corporate exist ence, and meant nothing more. 2. Sheykh ’Abdullah Suleyman said that the Government had not wished to leave the telegram, which he had shown me on February 11, unanswered. They had, therefore, expressed readiness to receive proposals from any properly authorised person. ’Abdul Hamid Bey Shedid had not been able to get any thing definite from the Corporation before he left Jedda, but had since telegraphed that they were sending a representative who was expected to arrive in Egypt on March 12 or 13. The Saudi Government had not replied to this telegram. 3. The Minister of Finance mentioned that, apart from their information from His Majesty’s Government, the Saudi Government had had unfavourable accounts of the persons concerned in the Corporation from other sources. He gave me the impression of being quite wary. I gather from Mr. Philbv, who is doubtless one of the other sources mentioned in the first sentence of this para graph, if not the only one, that the reason for not answering the latest telegram from ’Abdul Hamid Shedid is that the Government do not consider that it complies with the terms on which they had expressed readiness to receive pro posals. Enclosure 1 to Serial No. (47). Letter from His Majesty’s Minister, Jedda. to the Foreign Office, No. 76 (7371 124! 16), dated the 20th March 1934. With reference to my despatch No. 67 of. 13th March [Serial v o. (47)1, relative to the Hejaz Development Corporation, Ltd., and the proposal to create Lol 06FDa State Bank in this country, I have the honour to enclose a record of part of my conversation with Mr. Abdul Ghani Ydlibi on 17th March, when he 3 ame to see me about the projects of the Arabian Development Syndicate, Ltd. The earlier part of tne conversation related to oil concessions and 1 have reported separately wnat Mr. Ydlibi said to me on that subject. 2 . 1 have embodied in the enclosed record a few general observations of my own. 1 may add here that Mr. YYllibi impressed me very unfavourably at this, my first meeting with him. I should say that the Saudi Government, ignorant as they are of the intricacies of finance, would find it very difficult to control the operations of gentlemen so astute as Mr. Ydlibi himself and his local repre sentative Mr. ’Awayni. They might find it far from easy to limit the volume of the note issue and they would almost certainly be incapable of coping with the mysteries of foreign exchanges. 3 . I do not feel competent to express any view of the feasibility of the pro ject in itself. 1 do not know for instance enough of the arrangements in force in Iraq to judge whether the anlogy suggested by Mr. Ydlibi is sound and whe ther it would be practical to combine ordinary banking with the functions of a currency board. 1 am also puzzled as to what working capital would be available for the banking business, if the whole of the subscribed capital were immobilised to secure the note issue. Enclosure 2 to Serial No. (47). Memorandum by Sir Andrew Ryan, dated the 19th March 1934. After speaking about other matters, separately recorded, Mr. ’Abdul Ghani Ydlibi explained to Mr. Furlonge and myself on March 17 the bank scheme which he said he was propounding to the Saudi Government. The scheme is to create a Bank with a capital of £1,000,000 sterling. The Saudi Government would put up half of this (or £550,000, Mr. YYllibi threw in) and a British bank the other half. This capital would be applied to the purchase of British War Loan, to be deposited in the Bank of England. The Bank would issue notes on a sterling basis, which would be the only currency in this country— apparently a forced currency. Such notes would be issued up to the limit of the capital ; not beyond. All Government receipts would be paid into the Bank and it would conduct all transactions in foreign currencies. I asked (rt) whether Mr. Ydlibi had reason to think that the Saudi Govern ment could put up the proposed share of the capital ; and (b) whether he was assured of the support of a bank in Great Britain as regards the other half. As regards (a) Mr. Ydlibi said that the Government would doubtless have to make its contribution by stages. Mr. Furlonge understood him to sav that, if {hey could not find all or some of the money, the British partners would lend it to them at interest, an important point which I missed. As regards (b) Mr. Ydlibi said that he had not yet enlisted the support, but he anticipated no difficulty. The business would be perfectly secure, as the capital would be held by the Bank of England. I tried to elucidate the position which would be created as regards general banking. Mr. Ydlibi clearly contemplated that the Bank would have a monopoly of all banking and foreign exchange business. He was less clear as to whether this would result from the attractions it would offer or from the establishment of a legal monopoly. I suggested that in the latter contingencv, it would require a very strong financial police to enforce the monopoly and that it would mean ousting two established interests, viz., the Dutch Bank and Messrs. Gellatly Hankey and Company, a British concern. Mr. Ydlibi said that the Saudi Government would gain (a) by having a stable and secure monetary svstem on a sterling basis and (b) by receiving a half share of the profits of the Bank. He said that the scheme was similar to that which had been adopted in ’Iraq and which had Yielded a profit of some £100,000 in 1932. I asked whether the Saudi Government were to get a loan. He replied with a definite negative and said that he had made this quite clear to the Saudi Gov ernment. Mr. Ydlibi said that the Minister of Finance had approved the scheme. He seemed to hope that this, like his oil concession, might go through before he leaves Jedda on March 21./ A V 33 As for Mr. \dlibi, I told him that his scheme sounded interesting, but I refrained from asking him too many questions. It is, I think, a delinite part of his method to represent his projects as being much more advanced at any given moment than they actually are. I cannot believe that the Saudi Govern ment would in present circumstances jump at any scheme, which did not promise immediate ready money. In this connexion, it is worth noting that on March 11, Mr. Philby spoke of ’Awayni as having come back a week before without any concrete financial offer. At the time I took this to refer to the oil schemes but it may be that it really arose out of the nature of the Bank scheme. Al though the Ydlibi— 'Awayni combine have hitherto been little heard of in con nexion with definite proposals for a Bank, they have doubtless been considering the matter for some time. It will be remembered that a j^ear ago “ Awayni went to Riyadh, to try and dissuade the King at the last moment from proceed ing with the concession to the co;-Khedive and 'Abdul Hamid Shedid. Anything said by Mr. Philby must be considered with reference to the fact that he is hostile to the Ydlibi—'Awavni combine.

H. M. S. Penzance arrived at Aden at 0900 on 17th February. No dhow traffic had been observed south of Kamaran. Colonel Peilly was accorded a ceremonial reception on the return of the Mission ; a salute of 13 guns was tired by the Marbut Battery as Penzance approached the anchorage, and an escort of one Flight from No. 8 Squadron new over the ship.

W. from Perim and 100 miles from Aden. 25 Although it was clear that the ship could not arrive in the vicinity of Perim until early on the following morning, it was decided to proceed to sea with all despatch (4|5th power), and the ship sailed at 2015, working up to 14.o knots. This decision was based on the following facts :— (a) No such positive information of slaving activities has been received in Penzance—nor, as far as is known, in any other sloop—tor some &gt; ears. (£) Tlie name of the dhow and the persons quoted already figured on a “ suspect ” list in the ship. (c) The possibility existed that the dhow might be delayed in sailing until late at night, or might decide to remain at anchor off the African coast until after moonset (0045). (d) Although fresh and favourable winds for the passage from the African coast are to be expected at this season, the possibility of lighter winds and consequently of a slower passage could not be ignored. ^6 The ship was darkened, and at 0300 passed through the small Strait, when the armed motor boat was lowered in the lee of Perim Island ana com menced a north-and-south patrol outside the limits of territorial waters m the amiroaches to Sheikh Sevd.

With reference to Hasting’s Report of Proceedings for August, 1933, (No. 7-A.'8 of 6th September, 1933, the Resident in conversation re-affirmed his conviction that the efficiency of his military patrols prohibits the export of slaves from the Eritrean coast. These patrols are stated to be employed mainly on the Abyssinian frontier, and their function from an anti-slavery aspect is therefore the prevention of the entry of slave caravans into Eritrean territory. Doubtless all innocent traffic follows well-defined routes through the mountains of the interior, which may be adequately watched, but to regard the frontier as being closed effectively to small gangs engaged on this or any other illegitimate trade appears optimistic when the total military force is but 130 strong. Italian posts in the Red Sea. 9 . The Italian posts on Jebul Zukur and Great Hanish were referred to in casual conversation by the Resident, under whose orders they are maintained. He stated—as has been said before—that their function is to “ protect ” the fishing boats working there, as the area falls within the limits of a fishing con cession, covering most of the Eritrean coast, which has been granted to an Italian Firm. 10 . By what stretch of imagination the Hanish Group can properly be con sidered to lie within Italian jurisdiction and against whom protection is required are points upon which comment is superfluous. As, however, Doctor Oaraccioli appeared somewhat ill at ease on this topic, and the facts having already been fully reported, the matter was not pressed to the point of posing such embarras sing questions.

Letter erom the Resident, Aden, to the Colonial Office, No. 73, dated the 14th March 1934. I have the honour to draw your attention to the activities of Mr. E. 11. Bailey in the Yemen and in Aden. He was at one time associated wtih the Eastern and General Syndicate, Ltd., 19. St. Swithin’s Lane, London, E. 0. 4, and his movements have periodically been reported in the Aden Political Intelli gence Summary (paragraphs, inter alia, 1155, 2071 and 2554). 2. During my recent visit to San’a I was informed that in 1933 Bailey had borrowed money from various local people, the repayment of part of which he had offered in the form of a Bill on the Western and General Company, Ltd., of 19 Bloombury Avenue, W. Payment of this Bill had later been refused, and, Bailey having left the country, his creditors in San’a had been unable to get satisfaction. Other private debts that he had contracted there still remain unsettled, and he has left behind him an unsavoury reputation. 3 . Bailey had also, in March 1932, been associated in Aden with Charles Lazarus, a South African, and W. Keiller, a local sea-captain, in an unregistered company called the Red Sea Guano Syndicate Ltd. which was formed for the winning of guano from localities in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. In the name of the Syndicate he obtained a concession from a Treaty Chief in the Aden Protectorate, but was unable to develop it, and the project failed in cir cumstances that reflected little credit on the promoters. 4 . In view of the possibility that, following the conclusion of the Treaty of Friendship with the Yemen, British enterprise may be attracted to that country, it is important that British firms who wish to opeiate theie, and the lepiesen- tatives whom thev send should be of the highest standing and character, Bailey js in mv opinion not the example that one would wish of British commercial integrity and I recommend that if he applies to the authorities in the United Kingdom for papers or facilities for the purpose of revisiting Aden or the Yemen, they should be refused. 5. I know of nothing to the detriment of the Eastern and General Syndicate, and I have never previously heard of the existence of the “ Western and General Company Enclosure 2 to Serial No. (54). Extract from Aden, Political Intelligence Summary, No. 170, for week ended, 12th April 1930. Mr. E. R.

I have the honour to refer to paragraph 2780 of the Aden Political Intelli gence Summary No. 375 reporting the flight of two European aeroplanes over San’a on the 7th March 1934. 2. As a result of the several enquiries made by me on the subject, I wrote to the Imam on the 23rd March 1934, informing him that I had received news of a French civilian aeroplane having left Jibuti on the 7th March and that it was understood that it had flown over San’a and returned to Jibuti on the same day and had since then returned to France. I added that I had informed His Majesty’s Government and also the Consular Agent for France at Aden, and that the latter had been told by me that he (the Imam) objected strongly to aero planes flying over his country. 3. A reply has now been received by me from the Imam acknowledging receipt of my letter and thanking me for furnishing him with this information. He states that he has telegraphed to the French Foreign Ministry protesting against the flight and asking the French Government to take steps to prevent a repetition of such flights, which constitute a breach of international law.

A letter from the Imam was recently received by the Resident reporting the flight over Sana’a on 7th March of two European aeroplanes. The Imam thought that they were British, and was evidently much perturbed and he invoked the principles of International Law. The Resident replied immediately assuring the Imam that the machines had not gone from Aden dr the Aden Protectorate, and promising to make enquiries. A reply has been received from the Imam thanking the Resident and accepting his assurance. It appears that a French civilian aeroplane flew from Jibuti over San’a on the date mentioned. # * # * # * * (57) {Received on 2nd June, 1934, with Politicial Secretary's letter No. 20, dated the 17th May, 1934.

We passed to the Treasury for observations your confidential despatch No. 76(737jl24jl8) of the 20th March, about Ydlibi’s Bank scheme. The reply that they have up to the present no information about this scheme nor any indica tion that it is to be supported by a British Bank. They point out that it is more than doubtful whether we should be able or willing to do anything to encourage the formation of a note-issuing Bank in Saudi, Arabia, even if it were to be handled by people whose integrity was entirely above suspicion. The conditions which would permit of a Central Bank being set up seem to be a very long way indeed from being fulfilled in Saudi Arabia, and if the project is ever realized it will, in the opinion of the Treasury, have to be by stages. 2. They find some difficulty in giving a detailed written opinion on a case such as that of Ydlibi’s scheme, but they add that they would be very glad to have the opportunity to talk it over with you when next you are in England. 2. On a subsidiary point I may add that we too are mystified by Ydlibi’s reference to arrangements in Iraq. Apparently at one time during last year the Iraqi Government had a vague idea of creating a State Bank but we have heard no more about it.

MOVEMENTS OF ITALIAN VESSELS IN THE RED SEA. Letter from the Commanding Officer, H. M. S. Penzance at Aden, to the Senior Officer, Red Sea Sloops, dated the 19th February, 1934. [Copy of Staff Officer (I), Malta.]. Submitted with reference to Staff Officer (I), Malta, O. S.-7|34 of 10th Janu ary, 1934, and your message 1144 of 13th February, 1934, H. M. S. Penzance visited Perim for a few hours on 16th February, while conveying the Sa’na Mission to Aden, and the opportunity was taken of discussing the matter with Mr. C. C. Davey, the Government Agent. 2 . Mr. Davey states that although he was informed by the London Offices of the Perim Coal Company that the Italian surveying ship “ Ammiralglio Mag- naghi ” would visit Perim for coal during December, 1933, she has not yet been in the port. 3. On 13th January, the Italian sloop “ Ostia ” arrived and embarked oil fuel. Mr. Davey called, and was requested by the Commanding Officer to allow officers to land at the High Light for the purpose of taking a round of angles of peaks on the Arabian coast, including, presumably, the vicinity of Sheikh Syed. This permission was granted. \\ - * Subsequently Mr. Davey was informed by the Island Police that the officers, after making their observations at the High Light, descended to the Old Light on Obstruction Point and there made sketches. 4 . It is understood that these sketches were also of the Arabian coastline, but time did not admit of this being confirmed. If. M. S. Penzance will therefore call at Perim on her return passage from Djibouti, when the police officers con cerned will be interviewed. 5. Mr. Davey was informed that “ Ostia ” will call for fuel at monthly inter vals until May, when she is expected to return to Italy. He also gathered that “ Ammiraglio Magnaghi ” is engaged in survey work in the vicinity of Assab. 6 . In the event of further requests to land for hydrographical purposes being made on any future occasion, Mr. Davey proposed that permission should again be granted, a careful watch being kept on the movements of the observers, and a report forwarded. 7. These proposals were discussed with and concurred in by the Chief Com missioner, Aden, in view of the following facts— (a) Details of Perim island and the neighbouring Arabian coast are already shown in considerable detail on Admiralty chart No. 2592, “ Perim island and Bab-el-Mandeb Small Strait ”. (b) Nothing of a secret nature exists in Perim. (c) It is impossible to detect or prevent any sketching or photography that a foreign man-of-war may undertake while on passage through the Small Strait or elsewhere in the vicinity of the Island. (d) The difficulties which would attend the refusal of permission after having granted it on a previous occasion. 8 . In a general consideration of this incident, it will be recollected that the vicinity of Sheikh Seyd has always received the particular and sensitive atten tion of His Majesty’s Government, owing to its dominant position with regard to Perim and the Straits. In the Anglo-Turkish Boundary Agreement of 1904-5, this area was known as “ the yellow patch ” on the map, a special clause providing that on no account would Turkey alienate her tenure of it in favour of any other Power. 9 . From intercepted W|T messages en clair it now appears certain that both “Ammiraglio Magnaghi ’’ and “ Ostia ’’ are engaged in some work (presum- ablv survey) in the Assabthio area, and that a shore observation party, equipped with a portable WjT set has been landed. The sloop “ Asio ’’ also appears to be taking part in the operations.43 Tt is hoped that further information as to this activity will be obtained during the forthcoming visit of H. M. S, Penzance to Assab (6th-9th March). 10. The only other foreign warships who have visited Perim since 1st Janu ary, 1934, were the Dutch destroyers 4 ‘ Bankert ” and “Van Ness ”, who called on 8th-9th January, outward bound.

Letter from the Department of Overseas Trade, to the Foreign Office, No. 0.-39, dated the 23rd May, 1934. Very many thanks for your letter of May 22nd about Mr. R. S. TwftchelPs activities in prospecting for gold in Arabia. I recollect quite distinctly the earlier secret information regarding the matter. 2 . Apart from this, the only information which I have about Twitchell’s pre sent activities here is that I believe he is addressing a small meeting of the Central Asian Society, to be held in their offices in Grrosvenor Street, but as I have lost the ticl^t, I fear that I cannot state on what date this meeting is to take place. Probably, however, some member of your Department belongs to the Central Asian Society and either attended the meeting, or will know when it is to take jdace. 3. I had gathered, from a conversation with McFarlane of Gellatly Hankey and Company Limited that their object in taking a share in this project was less in the hope of obtaining any substantial return than from a sense of the need of watching what Philby and Twitched we Co up to Philby's previous escapade in regard to gold in the Assyrian Desert turned out, as you will remember, to be a&gt; Ls2.06FD45 complete fiasco. There were, indeed, indications that the so-called mine had been ‘ salted \ 4. On the other hand we have a certain amount of information about gold mining on the other side of the lied Sea, near Port Sudan. As long ago as May 1931 Turner (then Commercial Secretary to the Residency) wrote to me to the following effect :— 5. Mr. A. Beeby Thompson, who had advised the Egyptian Government about oil, and the Sudan Government about water, told Turner that he firmly believed there were really great possibilities about gold mining in various dis tricts between the Nile and the Red Sea. In the past the main practical difficulty in working these deposits was a shortage of water. Nowadays, with motor trans port, the question of water had become much simplified. Many of the workings which are marked as “ ancient gold workings ” in the general economic atlas of Egypt presented to the International Geographical Congress at Cambridge in 1928 by the King of Egypt have, in ancient times, merely been scratched. Beeby Thompson believed that, with up-to-date mining machinery, good results could be obtained. 0. We have also a note which shows that a gold mine exists at Gebeit which, as you know, is not far from Port Sudan. A new cyanide plant was installed there in the autumn of 1933 and was supposed to be ready by March, 1934. In the autumn of 1933 one of five stamp batteries was already in operation and pro ducing about £2,000 worth of gold per month. There are also records of other small mines in the same neighbourhood. 1. To sum up, there is a good deal of evidence that gold does exist on the west coast of the Red Sea, but there is no evidence whatever of heavy mineralisation in Arabia. Judging, however, from our experience in Western Abyssinia, the piesent high pi ice of gold may very well tempt some of the bigger and entirely respectable gold mining companies, probably through an intermediary, to take some interest in Twitchell’s venture since there is a market for the shares—if nothing else—of these low-grade gold properties at present. 8 As soon as I hear anything further of any personalities concerned with the scheme, I will not fail to let you know.

On April 27, Awayni brought here for translation a letter addressed by Shcykh ’Abdullah Suleyman to Ydlibi. I enclose a copy of the translation, from which you will see that the attitude of the Saudi Government up to that date was guarded without being actively discouraging. When Awayni called on me the following day, April 28, he referred to the enclosed letter. I said that I had seen it hurriedly hut that there did not appeal' to be much in it. He replied cheerfully that it contained all they needed to woxk on. I did not pursue the subject and we went on to talk about oil, in lines which I reported at the time. As regards the ’Iraqi analogy, I took Ydlibi to he referring to the ’Irak Currency Board and not to any bank. After my interview with him, I turned up page 128 of the general Report on ’Iraq for 1920-31 and page 26 of the Re port for January— October, 1032. I gathered from those reports that the ’Iraqi Government contemplated in 1927 a State Bank, with a monopoly of note issue, but that tills scheme was abandoned in favour of the present Currency Board. I do not, however, understand these tilings and it consoles me to find that the Treasury experts can make as little of Ydlibi’s scheme as I can. Enclosure to Serial No. (69). TRANSLATION.

T. 26524134, dated 26th June 1934. Letter from His Majesty's Minister of Jedda, to the Foreign Office, Department of Overseas Trade, No. O.T.-16, dated the 30th May 1931. I have the honour to report- that an announcement appeared in the Mecca newspaper ‘ Umm-al-Qnra ’ on May 5th to the effect that an “ Arabian Steam Navigation Company ” had been established in Jedda and had purchased two steamers which would run between Red Sea and Persian Gulf ports. One of■r—— aj 11 - 47 tlicse steamers, a vessel of some three hundred tons from Beirut formerly named “ Andree Edde ” but now renamed “ El h'atli ” arrived off Jedda on the 21st j\lay and sailed for Jizan two days later. The otner, also from Beirut and to be named “ El Nasr ”, lias not yet arrived. 2. It would appear that this Company, like the ‘ Arabian Export Com pany ’ described in my despatch No. O.lkll of the 4th April last originated in. the fertile brain of the Minister of Einnnce, who intended at tirst to use tiie snips for military transport, but has now conceived the idea of using them for commerce and possibly for the transport of pilgrims in the future. Sheykh Muhammad Serur as-Sabban, manager of the Export Co., fills the same-posh ion in the Steam Navigation Co., and the Amir Feysal, Fuad Bey Hamza, Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, and other notables are shareholders. The firm of Huseyn ’Awayni, a Syrian well-known connexion with the Lancashire trade and through, his association with the projects of Mr. A. (x. Ydiibi, are to act as shipping agents. The steamers themselves are said to have been bought from or through a certain Haji Khalil Tabbara, described as the pilgrim agent of Messrs. Gcllatly, Hankey &amp; Co. (Sudan), Ltd. of Beirut. X It is clear that the new company, while ostensibly a private concern, is in fact primarily a Government enterprise, representing the first attempt of the Saudi Government to enter the realms of commercial navigation. Indeed Sheykh Yusuf Yasin, while stressing the commercial character of the Company in con versation with me a few days ago, said that the Government had undertaken to guarantee any loss on working; The Government may be encouraged in this venture by the success of the motoi%car companies, which form a parallel instance of semi private, Government-controlled concerns and which were originally in tended for Government transport but now carry the bulk of the pilgrim traffic within the country. 4. It may be recalled in this connexion that in the latter paid of King Hussein’s reign, the Hashimite Government acquired at least four small vessels of this type and employed them either for coastal work or for transport of pilgrims, whom they sometimes forced to travel by them. Two or three of these vessels were attached in Egypt, I believe by order of a court, in satis faction of claims against them and efforts made by the Saudi Government to retrieve them after the fall of Jedda were unsuccessful. Another had been mortgaged to members of the Al-Fadhl family in Jedda and passed into their hands. It subsequently became more or less derelict and I do-not know what lias - happened to it. 5.

With reference to your telegrams Nos. 9 and 10 of the 21st June (Enclo sures 1 and 2, ante), 1 have the honour to enclose a copy of a note (Enlcosure 3, ante) which 1 have addressed to the Saudi Government regarding the landing ot R. A. 1’. \ ictoria aeroplane at Jubail on that date. I assumed for the purposes of my note that the landing was the involuntary result of inadvertence. 2. I take this opportunity of drawing attention to a statement in paragraoh 26 of^he^Intelligence Report of the Political Agent, Bahrain for May 1st to 15th (F. No. 53-N.j34), that one of the flying boats employed in the recent reconnais sance of Qatar landed at Jinnah Island on or just after the 11th May. T presume that as I was not notified by telegraph of this landing, the flying boat did not actually enter Saudi territorial waters. In view, however, of the importance attached in the standing instructions to doing everything possible to obviate protests by the Saudi Government, I suggest for the consideration of the Air Officer Commanding that it might be well to advise me of causes in which it as been necessary to land in the immediate vicinity of Saudi territory, in order to enable me to meet, at once any Saudi: criticism. 3. I am sending a copy of this despatch to H. M. Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Hon’ble the Political Resident in* the Persian Gulf, to whom I have already sent copies of Your Excellency’s telegrams under reference and of the enclosure of this despatch. (73) (Deceived on 25Ih August 1954. with Political Secretary's letter, No. 32, dated the 9th August 1934.) Enclosure in Foreign Office, covering letter, dated 3rd August 1934. Letter, from His Majesty’s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 145, DATED THE 14tH May 1934. With reference to paragraph 9 of my despatch No. 133 of the 28th April, F have the honour to enclose herewith one copy of the Saudi Green Book, whh h was published in its complete form on the 29th April. It runs, as you will see, to over 200 pages of close print, and I cannot hope to forward a translation ’ I enclose a summary of the contents of the book. The plan of the principal chap ters is to urovide a certain amount of explanation and comment in addition to the numbered documents which form the major portion. Numerous as these docu ments aie they certainly do not contain anything like all the correspondence which has passed since 1927. I will give you one instance which is of present importance. On the 8th May Fuad first spoke to me of the possibility of peace on the basis of compliance by the Imam with Ibn Sand’s demands as formulated at the outset of the present hostilities, subject to certain “ guarantees,” which seemed to be ot a formidable character, as they were to include a rectification of frontiers and an indemnity. I suggested, in a general wav, to Fuad Bey that, as the King had persistently repeated his demands in their original form it might be somewhat difficult to recede from the position that compliance with them was the only condition of peace. Fuad Bey gently reminded me that a treaty of friendship had also to be concluded and said that any question of“ ^aranlees ” would fall to be dealt with in this. Then he added that a tele- not piiohcdied in the Green Gook, had been addressed to the Imam warn- 1U M iarn ot the risks he might run, if actual hostilities became necessary. 2. The Green Book nevertheless contains texts of great interest. Perhaps the most interesting of all is the text of the first treaty between Ibn Sand and me lunsi, me exaci nature oi which has long been a subject of speculation. 1 enclose a rough translation of this agreement, but as I cannot have it checked at present, i would ask that it should not be used for purposes of publication untu a more accurate translation can be made. You will observe that it bears Hie date the 16th Dhu’l Hijja, 1338 (the 31st August, 1920), whereas it is refer red to in Hie second Saudi-Idrisi Treaty of the 21st October, 1926, as an agree- ^hiar, 1339 (the 24th October, 1920). I have ascertained from 1 uad bey that the date of signature is correctly stated in the Green Book and tmd the after date is that ot a letter from Ibn Sand approving of it. This ga\ o the agreement final validity, the Idrisi himself having signed the original. , ,J ' ^ Imam has become so closelv associated in European language with the Imam Yahya that it may not be out of place to remind you that it is borne oqmdJv by Ibn Baud as Imam of the Wahabis and bv the Idrisi as the religious head of his own adherents. It has often, in the 'past, been applied to them tout court, with results that are nowadays somewhat confusing. 4. It will be seen from the enclosed translation that the first Saudi-Idrisi 1 reaty did not in any precise sense establish frontiers. What it did was to take account of the ancestral claims of Ibn Baud, founded on the early expan sion of Wahabi and the more recent expansion of the Idrisi, whose pretensions, it not Ins actual occupation, extended to areas far greater than his dominion in the Tihama of A sir. The effect of the agreement was to partition the total area which both might claim, but much more with reference to tribes and their ranges than to geographical features. I need not pursue the analysis further at piesent. I would point out, however, that, unless a treaty in modern form ' tween Ibn Baud and the Imam ^ ahya relegates all past arrangements to limbo, the agreement of 1920 may still have importance in connexion with the compli cated question of Ibn Baud’s titles. ■o iNext in interest is the account given of the negotiations between Ibn Simd and the Imam \ahya in 1927-28 and the settlement of the Arwa question in 1931. The story of the two missions which Ibn Baud sent to Sana in 1927 and the Yemeni missions which came to Mecca in 1928 becomes much clearer than it has hitherto been. The telegrams between the Imam and Ibn Baud which produced the latter’s award giving Arwa to the Imam are still of interest. The most important points are perhaps the following :— (a) When the first Saudi mission went to Sana they were confronted with a i emeni claim to the whole of A sir, as having always been Yemeni, despite Idrisi occupation. TJie Saudi mission counterclaimed the whole country as far as Mokha and Zebid and inland to Bajil, as having been Idrisi, and denied all i emeiu claims in A sir. It is not astonishing that no agreement was reached. (b) Chapter III contains proces-verbaux of meetings held during the vi-ir of the second Saudi mission to Sana. If trustworthy, they bear out the recent Amdi contention that an oral agreement of sorts was reached in the course otiwo meetings, as stated in Mr. Zada’s letter to Mr. Rendel of the 28th Julv 143.,. It is less important to try to ascertain the effect of that agreement, none ot the versions of which quite agree in terms, than to record the fact that it was clearly a status quo arrangement only. The best of several proofs of Hus is that, when sending his own mission immediatelv afterwards to Mecca, tlio Imam wrote a letter to Ibn Baud in which he described his object as being to convince the King of bis claim to “ what is in the hands of the Tdrisi ^gather with all that is counted as of Khaulan-bin-Amr and Hamdan-bin- . vd. . his, 1 think, can he taken as a restatement of his demands of the pre vious vear. though it is difficult to estimate the territorial scope of demands in regard to the interior, defined with reference to the names of tribal ancestors. (A The Imam’s mission to Mecca accomplished absolutelv nothing and though the status quo went on if might well be argued that whatever validitv it had was impaired or destroyed bv the failure of the negotiations in the course d vr as more or Jess defined. The Imam does not. however, seem to have taken this line. He bided his time until he advanced to Arwa.i 51 (d) The A rwa incident led to a fresh meeting of delegations. As you are aware, they came to a deadlock over territorial questions and the Imam left the matter to the arbitration of Ibn Sand. The King’s telegram of the 22nd Kajab, IhoU (the bra December, Ibbl), giving his awaru, is precise only in the phrase : “ 1 say that I abandon Jebel Arwa to your Honour.” It is, however, clear from the corrospondnce that other specific areas had been discussed, including that of the Beni Malik and Jebel Fifa, and the Imam, in his reply of tne 27th Ha jab, 1350 (the 8th December, 1931), said that he had instructed his delegates not to pursue the question of that particular area. This goes far to justify jlm Sand’s resentment at the Imam's recent interference in the area in ques tion, but the correspondence is in other respects ambiguous. Tne editor of the Green Book seems hardly justified in stating that the Imam’s telegiam constitutes a complete recognition of the frontier by the Imam, subject onl\ to a request of consideration of a proposal of his in regard to two named tribys. From a European point of view the upshot of the Arwa dispute can only be re garded as obscure, except as regards Arwa itself and perhaps the Bom Malik- Fifa area. (e) Immediately after the settlement of the Arwa question, the delegates signed a Treaty of Friendship, &amp;c., dated the 15th December, 1931. It was noted at the time that this treaty made no reference to frontiers. It has always been doubtful whether the Imam regarded it as a treaty at all, although the Saudi Government stated later that it had been ratified by an exchange of telegrams. It now appears from the texts of these as published in the Green Book that Ibn • Sand’s telegram expressed a straightforward approval of what his delegates had agreed to, but the Imam’s telegram could be read either as an approval or as a postponement pending further discussion. On the face of it, it looks like an approval, but he asked the King to send his delegates again to discuss out standing minor points.. 6. Chapters VI to XIII relate to the most recent phase beginning about the end of August 1932, when, after delay due to various causes, including the Ibn Eifada revolt, the King again turned his attention seriously to his rela tions with the Imam. I have not had the whole of these chapters translated, as you are familiar with the main course of events and the result of all the nego tiations, including the King’s suggestion for a sort of alliance, lias been negatived so far as any agreements of permanent effect are concerned. 7. I have not vet had time to study Chapter XIV, which deals with the Yam and with Xajran. The divergence of vknvs regarding these has been so complete and both parties are, to my mind, on such wmak ground that I do not expect the documents to prove of much use either way, but, if 1 find them to be of sufficient interest, I will submit a further report on them at leisure. 8 . The Imam Yahya is a master of obscure language. Ibn Sand is more capable of precision, but can be equally obscure on occasion. They both, as you know', overlay most of wdiat thev say with blankets of pious verbiage. I trust, therefore, that you wall make allowance for the imperfection of this despatch, which I have prepared at a time of great pressure from rough translations of highly peculiar texts. T have endeavoured to isolate the points v'hich seem to have most bearing on the present dispute, in case the recent happy turn of events should result in a rational general settlement free from the ambiguities of the past. 9. In this connexion I would revert to my despatch Xo. 1 of the 2nd January relative to the possibility of a Saudi claim to Hudevda and connected matters. In that despatch I expressed the view that a study of historical events since 1872 might be a useful contribution to an examination of the claims and counter-claims of the two rulers. I have found that to be really useful such a study should go much further back, and, wffiile I have collected a good deal of material, I have found it Quite impossible to complete and collate it. The most I can hope to do is to produce at some future time a paper of some historical interest, even though a settlement between Ibn Sand and the Imam should deprive it of practical utility. 10. In the meanwhile the facts which I have collected are of use in shaping mv own views. If I were revising mv desnatch Xo. 1 of 2nd January, I should amend it in various particulars. I should not, however, alter my vmw r that Tbn Sand has a good case for claiming both ports of A sir : that he would have a verv noor case for claiming as against the Imam, on historical or lo&lt;ml grounds, the littoral beyond a point somewhere not far south of the Wadi Tashar ; andthat neither he nor the Imam has any strong claim to Najran, as against the local tribes. As regards Hndeyda, I find myself supported by no less an authority than Ibn Sand himself, who, in the conversation reported in Sir G. Clayton’s despatch of the 16th July, 1928, to the Colonial Office, said : “ That he would leave the Imam in possession of Hudeyda, to which he recognised the Imam’s clear right.”. 11.

Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Treaty between His Majesty the King and the Idrisi, signed August 31, 1920 (Translation). ' ’ IN the name of God the Most Merciful, the Compassionate peace may be upon the Prophet of God. Ls296FD Prayers and53 May it be known to him who sees and reads this that when the Imam Abdul Aziz-bin-Abdurrahman-al-Feysal, may God protect him, ordered us to go to the Imam Muhammad-bin-Ali-bin-Idris to conclude an agreement of particular Islamic brotherhood and to bring about union in the religion of God and His Prophet, and to invite people to collaborate in good deeds and piousness, to cause good manners to be carried out and evils prohibited, to strive in the Course of the pause of God and to endeavour to unite the hands against the enemies of the religion. When we approached the above-mentioned Imam he was glad and pleased to hear it. He liked it and he was keen about collaboration in working for the welfare. It was, therefore, decided by us and him to have an agreement of brotherhood concluded between the two above-mentioned Imams on the above- mentioned lines. Whereas there were in the kingdom (? territory) of the Imam Muhammad-bin-Ali tribes and cities in Yemen of those which were in the past belonging to A1 Sand, the Imam Abdul Aziz has left them for him because of his desire for the welfare and collaboration in the same and his good behaviour. It is, therefore, necessary, to specify the tribes and to distinguish them in order that each one of them may undertake the duties commanded by God in respect of the subjects under him., So the tribes of all Yam, Wadaa and those which belong to them of Beni Jamaa, Sahar, Sharif, Qahtan, Rufeyda and Ubeyda, including Beni Bishr, Beni Talq, Shahran, Beni Shehr, Ghamid, Asir Ghamid, and all “ Qadha ” (province) of Mahayel, including Beni Thua, people of Bareq and Tarqash, people of Ar Rish, and others who belong to them, and all the tribes of Hali mentioned are all under the Imam Abdul Aziz. Those belonging to the Imam Muhammad-bin-Ali-al-Idrisi are Tihama, except what is mentioned above, and other belongings in his possession. Rijal-al-Ma of Asir is his own property. Neither party should interfere in affairs of the subjects of the other party. The tribes of the Surat, Tihama, Yam and others mentioned above as belonging to Abdul Aziz-bin-Abdurrahman cover the villages and the Bedouins in mountains and plain lands. They have to advise and collaborate with each other, and to exert their endeavours in performing their duties commanded by God as to what is necessary for the religion of Islam and in respect of their subjects. This has been issued, written and declared by us, the representa tives of the Imam, as we are acting on his behalf, and by the Imam Muhammad- bm-Ali-bin-Idris, in his presence and under his signature. This agreement and covenant has been given by us and him. He who goes back on his word will be violating his own promise. May God grant us success. Prayers and peace of God may be upon Muhammad, his relatives and friends. 16th Dhul Hijja, 1388 (31st August, 1920). i (Seal.) MUHAMMAD-BIN-AJH-BIN-IDRIS.

I am commanded by my Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to transmit for the information of the Secretary of State for India in Council extracts from a report of proceedings of H. M. S. Colombo at Mukalla and Socotra covering the period 23rd to 25th April, 1934. 2. Similar letters have been sent to the Colonial Office and the Air Ministry. Enclosure to Serial No. (74).

On arrival the Port Officer and doctor came off and I arranged to call on His Highness the Sultan. This I did54 at 11-00. In the afternoon His Highness returned my call, was shown round the ship and took tea on board, being saluted with 11 guns on leaving. That night four officers and myself dined with His Highness the Sultan, and were entertained to a cinema show afterwards. A searchlight display Avas given after dark. 36. Early the next morning His Highness the Sultan sent a present of four live goats, eight tins of honey and four bunches of bananas. The Sultan was very interested in visiting the ship, and did all he could by placing cars at our disposal to make our stay agreeable. The Sultan is half Indian and well informed. He has travelled in Europe and Avas contemplating another trip shortly, I believe to Vienna. 37. The ship left at 07-00 on the 24th April. Socotra. 25th April (Time Zone—3J). 38. The ship arrHed at 11-00, and anchored £ mile off Tamarida in 7 fathoms. Owing to the clearness of Avater, it being possible to see the bottom at 8 fathoms, it is a little alarming when entering the Bay for the first time. 39. On arrival, a native, who stated he Avas the “ harbour master ”, came off and said they had not been notified of our visit (actually the letter announcing our arrival Ayas brought to us from Mukalla) and that His Highness the Sultan Avas in the hills. I accordingly arranged to meet the Sultan ashore at 16-00 that afternoon, which Avas done. 40. The Sultan had nothing to report and had not been Adsited by any other warships or merchant ships. I particularly asked him if any Italians had visited Socotra, which he said was not so. 1 did this as, at Aden I Avas , told that sometime ago Italians from Somaliland had been there and Avere thought to be surveying. The Sultan and his following are of a level of cmli- sation similar to the Sheik at Sharjah. The usual courtesies Avere exchanged in the Audience House, at Avhich I Avas receHcd with a series of detonations on arrival by the guard firing their rifles. I asked the Sultan if he Avould like to visit the ship but he excused himself as it Avas getting late. 41. After giving a searchlight displav, the ship left for Lamu at 20-10 Just prior to leaving, His Highness the Sultan sent off a present of tAvo live sheep, for which I returned a present of tea, SAveets and cigarettes I also gave the “ harbour master ” a small present in reply to his request for “ bac Siieesh , the only word of practical value he seemed to know. I took a letter for the Sultan for transmission to Aden. (75) Memorandum from the Foreign Office, No. E.-5102]2429I25, dated the 11th August 1934.

The Regulation of the Council of Ministers of the 19th Sha’aban 1350 [Enclosure 2 to Serial No. (1) in File No. 132-NJ32], to which reference is made in the second article of the measure, is doubtless that which formed the enclosure to Mr. Hope Gill’s despatch No. 118 of the 5th March 1932 and the departments formerly attached to the Ministry of the Interior would appear to be those specified in Article 17 of that measure.

No. 204 (1951/204/19), dated the 2nd July 1934. ou are aware that at various times during the past three years, atten tion has \ cen directed to the possibility of gold being discovered ’ in the He]az in commercially exploitable quantities. Interest in the sub ect has been stimulated pnm ipally by the activities of Mr. K. jv Twin lu ll, an Luitod Males citizen, who has made several stays in the country, at first as an expert employed by the Saudi Government for various surveys etc., and later as a private person with commercial interests. In February of ast ;yeai he was closely associated with Mr. Hamilton, the representative sent here bv the Standard Oil Company of California to negotiate the Hasa Oil concession, and it was understood at that time that he had interested one or more American concerns, whom he would himself represent, in other mining enterprises, and more particularly gold mining see inter alia para graph 15 (c) of the Jedda Report for February 1933 (F. No. 31.-N/33). His earlier explorations had disclosed the existence of gold, though not necessarily in important quantities, in various places, notably the North- Western Hejaz, and two districts not far from Taif and Medina respect- ive y. Some or all of these places are known historically as sources of ^old in ancient times. ' 3 2. For some time after February 1933 little more was heard of gold Nothing appears to have come of Mr. Twitchell’s efforts to interest the American concerns more actively. He pursued his own activities, however, and the continued interest of the Saudi Government in the subject was demonstrated by the inquiry regarding gold mining 'legislation in the British Empire, which I reported in my despatch No. 372 of the 20th Dec- emb*r last. 3. Mr. Twitched has now succeeded in obtaining the backing of what appear Xo be important interests in the United Kingdom. He returned to Jedda cn the 27th June as representative of the recently formed “Saudi Arabia Mining Syndicate Limited”, which, it would appear from the press, has been registered in England as a private company with a capital of twenty thousand pounds in one pound shares. 1 understand from Mr I witched that the controlling interest in this new concern is that of the Anglo-Oriental and General Investment Trust, one of whose directors is on the board of the Syndicate but that the composition of the Syndicate as a whoie is unusually varied. Among the other persons and firms interested are a Mr McDermott and Messrs. Gellatly Hankey and Company Limited whose Jedda manager confirms information from other sources regarding their participation on a small scale. r is Mr ‘ Twitclle ^ appears to be entirely independent ^ tandar&lt;i pJ Company of California. He or thev or both have indeed been at pains to mark the dissociation. It would have been natural tor him to stay in Jedda with his only compatriot, the representative of the Calitornia Arabian (Standard Oil Company, but he has instead taken up 1 tu J 00 *? 1 h °of- 1 believe him t0 also entirely disconnect ed with Mr. Philby s firm, Sharqieh Limited, who have in the past had some interest in gold and who still, I believe, control that old-established but now inert ooocern Midian Limited. As regards his connections in London I gather that he explored the possibility of working with the Heiaz Develop- rnent Corporation limited. See the correspondence ending with my des patch No. (,/ of the 13th March [Serial No. (47)], but was not impressed 813(C) F&amp;PD r ^58 by the interests represented in that concern. I think that he regards the Arabian Development Syndicate, in which Mr. Ydlibi and the Eastern and timoral c.i-'-ile l jmited are interested, as potential rivalv but cf this I am m)L sme. 5. I gather that Mr. Twitchell’s immediate objective is to treat with the Saudi Government for prospecting rights in any areas likely to pro duce gold, in the hope of eventually obtaining concessions to be worked by subsidiary companies. 6. It may be worth adding that Mr. Twitchell has acquired some in terest in certain gold mining propositions in the Sudan. In this area he is associated with Messrs. Foley, Bishop and Clark, who appear to have formed or to be forming a company to handle three propositions at places called (?) Wadi Aw, (?) Makraf and a third of the name of which I am even less certain. They are not interested in the proposition at Gebeit, which is being handled by another British subject independently. 7.

Many thanks for your letter E.-4624/2792/25 of August 3rd about Mr. Twitchell’s company for gold mining in Saudi Arabia. 2. Upon receipt of Ryan’s despatch No. 204 [Serial No. (78)], we had already asked for a status report which has now been received and of which I enclose a copy. 3. J do not know personally anything about any of the shareholders. Gellatly Hankey told me that they did not expect much to come of this and merely took up their share in order to be informed regarding what was going on. As you know, there is considerable activity in speculative gold mining shares at present owing to the price of gold. The big and first-class gold mining companies frequently take a share in these speculative companies^ but usually are at pains to keep their own name out of the business. Enclo. 2 to S. No. (78). Letter from the Department of Overseas Trade, London, to Mr. Clough, Taylor, No. A. T. R.-24292/34/S./32, dated the 1st August 1934. In reply to your letter of the 27th July in which you ask for a report on the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate Limited, I have now made enquir ies and secured the following information :— It is a private company which was registered on the 16th May, 1934 “to acquire any concessions, leases or rights for any mining objects or pur pose”. The nominal capital is £20,000 in £1 shares, of which £10,000 has been issued for cash and of the issued capital, £1 has been paid on each of 1,252 shares and 4 on each of 8,748 shares. The directors are:— I Louis Hardy (British), Director of Anglo-Oriental and General In vestment Trust Ltd. , Hugh Robert Edwards (American). E. D. McDermott (British), Director of Consolidated Mines Selection Co., Ltd. , ;There are twenty-six shareholders including the following:— Shares. Karl Saben Twitchell (London) 1,000 Louis Hardy, Director ........ 500 William H. Edwards (London) ...... 500 The Rt. Hon. A. S. Lord Castle Steward ..... 750 Hugh Robert Edwards, Director ...... 600 S. H. Verrall, Accountant ....... 600 L. Wm. Payne, Secretary ....... 1,000 Wm. C. Thomas, Clerk . 1,998 Gellatly Hankey &amp; Co. (Sudan), Ltd. 400 E. D. McDermott ......... 50 The company is respectably constituted and is considered good for its ordinary engagements. With regard to the control being in the hands of Anglo-Oriental and General Investment Trust Limited, it will be seen from the above that this company does not hold any shares in its own name, but some of the shareholders may be nominees. It will be observed that Louis Hardy is a director of both concerns. (79) (Received on 9tJi September 193&amp;, with Political Secretary 1 s letter No. 34 , dated the 23rd August 1934.)

Letter from His Majesty’s Charge d’affaires, Jedda, to the High Commissioner, Palestine, Jerusalem, No. 2224/81/137, dated the 24th July 1934. ‘ During an interview here on the 19th July, Sheykh Yusuf Yasin, the Saudi Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs, asked me to do him a personal favour. It transpired that a friend of his named Hussain al Awayni (Aoueini), now resident in Haifa, desired “to open a shop’’ and received permission to take up permanent residence in Palestine. Sheykh Yusuf therefore invoked my assistance in getting this permission accorded to his friend. .1 • I pointed out that, as he was well aware, the regulations governing per manent residence in Palestine were strict, but promised to do with I could to please him. I would be grateful, consequently, if any application that Awayni might make in this connection to the Palestine authorities could be favourably regarded. I attach herewith a printed sheet dated the 1st January 1934, con taining particulars of Awayni’s firm, Bohsali and Awayni of Haifa, from which it would appear that the “shop” is actually a factory for the manu facture of cotton and silk piece-goods. For your confidential information, Hussain al Awayni is also the inti mate friend of Fuad Hamza and is the agent here for the Manchester piece- goods merchant Ydlibi, together with whom he has been playing a certain role here in connection with oil concessions in this country.61 r (81) (Received on 9th Septejnher 1934, with Political Secretary's letter No. 34, dated the 23rd August 1934.)

Port Sudan 7-10th August — 6 .... I sailed for Kamaran at 1000 on 10th August. During the passage, a message was received from the Resident, Aden, informing me that owing to a delay in the dispatch of the Imam s present from Englana, thp Political Secretary would be unable to leave Aden for Hodeida and Sanaa to ratify the treaty between the British and the Imam until the 30th August. . i i -63 Arrived K AMAH AN at 1000 on 12th August. i Kamaran 12-15th August — 7. The Acting Administrator, Dr. Chohan, informed me that he had received a communication from the Governor of Hodeida, Abdullah Wazir, pointing out that a number of Yemeni subjects, chiefly from I.oheiva, who had recently left the mainland for Kamaran, had not yet returned. As the majority of them owed money in Loheiya, he (Wazir) would be very grateful if they could be ordered to leave Kamaran forthwith. 8. Dr. Chohan caused an immediate census to be taken, which re vealed the fact that there was no less than 16 men and 172 women and children from Loheiya and 20—25 women and children from Khoba still remaining in Kamaran. They were dispersed in small groups throughout the native village, unknown evidently, to the Administrator, Captain Wickham, who had reported Kamaran clear of refugees some weeks previously. 9. An immediate announcement was made by town crier that they would) all have to leave within 48 hours, and in spite of arguments, protests and excuses, the sergeant of police was able to report that they were all afloat and clear of Kamaran Harbour at the expiration of this period, viz., noon on 14th August. Abdullah Wazir was informed accordingly. *#**##* Aden, 22 nd - 30th August .— 16. . * . . .

Arrived at Hodeida at 1400 on Slst August, saluting with 21 guns before anchoring. (Hodeida is now again a saluting port). A boat was atonce sent in for Seleh Jaffer, the Political Clerk, who came off with all information as to the arrangements which had been made as regards land ing, calls, etc. He was followed shortly afterwards by the Secretary to Abdullah Wazir, who sent his greetings and welcome. The Mission, accompanied by myself, left the ship at 1530. Lieut., Colonel lake, as Head of the Mission, being accorded as salute of 13 guns. Large crowds thronged the waterfront to witness the landing and a full sized guard of honour was drawn up outside the house allocated to the Mission for the night. Here Abdullah Wazir received us most affably and with genuine pleasure, whilst a brass band played selections beneath the window. 18. After about twenty-five minutes, Abdullah Wazir, proceeded to the Palace where he subsequently received) the Mission again. I excused myself from this second call, and also from the dinner which was provided for the Mission at their house. 19. I cannot refrain from mentioning the rusty ladder , which constitutes the official landing place. The ladder had disintegrated, and the part which remained above water leant, unsecured, against the jetty at a broad angle Consequently, as the boat rose with the swell, so we were borne further from our first objective. The alternatives were a soaking when the boat was alongside in the trough, or a leap when the boat was well clear cn the crest. Neither of these alternatives ivas conducive to dignity, particularly as we were suitably dressed for calling and were being watched by hundreds of pairs of eyes. Having gained the ladder, thesecond objective remained, viz., the top of the jetty. This was achieved on anding, by being dragged from the top rung by two Yemeni soldiers and pn eavmg by sitting on the jetty and lowering oneself by hand. Damage to the boat s hull was certain in any case. Had I been aware of the state ot affairs, I should have requested that suitable arrangements might be made e ore tne Mission landed. I have since made the necessary representations. Mission left for Sanaa at 06-30 on the following morning (1st September) A description of the gift carried by them from His Majesty to the Imam may be of interest. It was a sword. The scabbard of which was of scarlet velvet, with fittings of gold. The sword itself had a handle of ivory and a hilt of gold. The blade was inscribed, in English on one side and in Arabic on the other:— “From His Majesty King George V of England to His Majesty the Jn.am Yahya Bin Mohamed Hamid-ud-Din Kin^ of the Yemen.* ’ 2 * * 5 Lieutenant Colonel Lake kindly allowed this beautiful object to be displayed on the Quarterdeck, where it was greatly admired by all. The Mission also carried! two gold watches, suitably inscribed for the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary respectively. * * * * # * 21. Our short stay culminated in a present from Abdullah Wazir which he must have regarded as part of the Ratification, consisting as it did of 1 calf, 4 sheep, 2^ dozen chicken, 3^ dozen pigeons, 20 lbs. ot grapes, 7 dozen eggs, 4 bags of coffee and baskets of bananas, cucumbers, tomatoes and limes I responded with a letter expressing my appreciation of and gratitude for his generous gift, and sent him a consignment of treacle and preserved fruit on the usual scale.

With reference to my despatch No. 286 (2620/115/13) of the 18th September, in which I briefly reported Ibn Sa’ud’s return to Riyadh from Taif, 1 have the honour to inform you that although the King’s movements convey the impression that the general situation in this country give no cause for disquietude. I have recently received reports from two sources which would suggest that Ibn Sa’ud’s triumphant assertion of power in his recent struggle with the Yemen has not altogether overawed certain disaffected elements within his own country. 2. Discontent is said to exist in the Jauf and Teima areas and forces are being sent there to stabilise the situation. My Indian Vice-Consul has just returned from a visit of several weeks to Medina and reports that re cruiting is being unobstrusively carried on in the town, the troops being destined for service in those northern districts. That there was trouble, of an undefined nature, in respect of three tribes in the north whose names however were not specified, I gathered a few days ago indirectly from a subordinate in the Governorate here.3. These reports lend interesting corroboration to the information which has recently been appearing in the Royal Air Torce Monthly Intelli gence Summaries for Palestine and Trans-Jordan, of which the most recent example is contained in paragraph 261 of the Summary for August, 1934. 4.

Immediately before Saudi protest was received His Majesty’s Gov ernment had decided to carry out in near future further survey of this area (lasting 3 or 4 days and involving a few flights and short ground trips to fix 3 or 4 key points) with a view to clearing up various obscurities on points about which accurate information is essential before decision can bereached as to line to be taken with Saudi Government on whole question of Transjordan frontier. Arrangements have been made, subject to con currence of acting High Commissioner, for survey to start at end of this month and it is most important that it should not be unnecessarily delayed. I am most reluctant to make any communication to Saudi Government regarding this survey, since it is not intended that aircraft should in any circumstances fly over indisputably Saudi territory and communication might only give impression that His Majesty’s Government were doubtful of the strength of their case in maintaining that car-track and adjacent areas are definitely within Transjordan. Hitherto it has been assumed that this survey could be carried out without risk of difficulty from Saudis since adjoining areas of Saudi terri tory have been believed not to be under effective Saudi administrative control. Present Saudi protest has, however, somewhat modified the situation,; and if you consider that survey in these conditions is likely to lead to danger of serious incident and that this danger might be reduced by some communication to Saudi Government, please telegraph immediately in order that matter may be further considered.

It occurs to me also that presence in this area of tribes migrating into Saudi Arabia might give unwelcome publicity to movement of a survey party but I am unaware whether such migration will still be proceeding at the end of October. If key points are not wide of track and if survey which I note is to be brief be conducted discreetly there may be little to differentiate it from activities of routine patrol (which I assume will not be discontinued on account of present protest). If key points are well east of track obviously much greater discretion must be exercised. In view of the foregoing and inadequate information on material points I find it difficult to size up possibility of serious incident though personally doubt whether anything more serious than a further protest may be expected and to reduce risk of that is not in my opinion worth commu nicating with Saudi Government. Generally I am strongly averse to any such communication. I suggest ag to danger of serious incident Transjordan may be in a better position to advise. , ...68 Memorandum No. 1030-S of 1934, dated the 2nd November 1934., The Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf presents his compliments to 1.

When I was at home on leave recently I expressed jthe view m casual conversation to the India Office, and I think also to the Foreign Office, that in spile of Ibn Baud’s ostensible victory in the Yemen war, his—Ibn baud s— stock had probably gone down amongst the Arabs of the Persian Gult. (The reasons I gave were that when Ibn Saud made his victorious invasion of Yemen territory as far,down as, and including, Hodeidah, there was much talk, not only in the Arab but in the English Press, of how he was going to follow up these initial successes: capture Sana, install his son Feisal as (Viceroy of the Yemen, exact enormous indemnity from the Imam Yahya, and so forth, and that the final result fell far short of these expectations., 2. I fuijther expressed the opinion that the net result of the campaign in Arab eyes was that while Ibn Saud had secured Nejran, he had evacuated jthe jyfiole of the Yemen coast-line, including Hodeidah, without extracting a penpy ,of indemnity from the enemy- That the average Arab’s idea of statesmanship was :— “Tfie good old rule, the ancient plan, That he shall itake who has the power, And he shall hold who can”, and that he would refuse to believe that Ibn Saud would have given such easy terms to the Imam if he had been strong enough to impose severer, ones. 3 . Duripg an interview which I had with the Shaikh of Kuwait when I passed through there recently on my way out, he touched on the question of the Saudi-Yemen war, and said definitely that Ibn Saud’s prestige had gone down qu the Arab Coast of the Gulf as a result of that campaign. I enclose for ready reference an extract from a recent Kuwait Intelligence Summary, which is to the same effect. The factor of Arab public opinion with regard to Ibn Saud is of some practical importance as his authoritv over his subjects, especially over the tribal elements, depends a good deal on prestige. I am sending a copv of jthis letter to Metcalfe and to Calvert at Jedda. Perhaps the Foreign Office would be good enough to give Ryan a copy;r 69 a •c Enel. 2 to S. No. (94). 1 ; t !

Bin Saud and Yemen Campaign. — (a) Since the writer returned from leave, he has found many opportunities of discussing past Yemen events with a number of Bedouin trans-border Chiefs, as well as with the Shaikh of Kuwait and notables of the Town. On all sides he has been told that Bin Saud has definitely lost much “prestige” as a result of the war. Everywhere the belief is very strong that had Bin Saud been strong enough, nothing in the world would have prevented him from over-running or crushing Yahya- He, however., found himself in imminent danger after his seizure of Hodeida, of being surrounded and his armies destroyed, so he wisely obeyed the instincts of self-preservation and made the peace he did. Yahya was also satisfied, being an old man and without aggressive ideas—for had he not won the moral victory and forced Bin Saud to with draw, without so much as surrendering an inch of Yemen territory, or paying a rial by way of indemnity? (b) The barren Nejran after all was no gain to Bin Saud, but has merely been given ito her own people, the Yam tribe, who are blood brothers of the Murra and Ajman tribes. ***** (95) (Received on November 1934, with Political Secretary's letter No. '45, dated the 8th November 1934 .) j Letter from H. M.’s Charge d’affaires, Jedda, to Foreign Office, No. 300, dated the 2nd October 1934. I have the honour to inform you that the Mecca newspaper the Saut- al-Ptijaz announced in its issue of the 24th September the appointment by Ibn Saud of his Minister of Finance, Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman-al-Ham- dan. to be Deputy Minister of Defence, an office he is to occupy in addition to his present one. As you are aware, the Minister of Finance has for some time, and notably during the recent conflict with the Yemen, effectively performed the functions of Minister of War. 2. The same communique also announces the appointment of Sayyid Saleh Shata (Personalities Report, No. 85) and Sheikh Khalid Abul Walid- al-Qarqani (Personalities Report, No. 57) as members of the permanent committee of the Council of Ministers. 3. It is a little curious that no reference to (these important appoint ments should appear in the Umm-al-Qura, a newspaper, which is generally regarded as the official or semi-official organ of the Saudi Government..

Al Qarqani was brought to Ibn Sa’ud’s notice, it is said, by Sheykh Hafiz Wahba, and came to the Hejaz in 1930. Was appointed in September 1930 First Assistant to the Viceroy, but apparently soon vacated the post and 613(C) f&amp;pdwent into business with the German merchant, afterwards honorary German Consul, de Haas. Was re-employed by the Government to accompany the American engineer Twitchell on his tours of survey for water and minerals. L Was sent with Hamad Suleyan (q.v.) to ’Asir in November 1932 to investi gate the dispute between the Idrisi and Ibn Sa’ud’s Governor. This mission could not be accomplished by the two delegates, who are still stand ing by in ’Asir. Khalid al Qarqani is spoken of as a man of character and an honest one. Enel. 2 to S. No. (95).

Was one of the Hejazi notables who compelled the abdication of King Huseyn in October 1924 and rallied in due course to Ibn Sa’ud. Became one of two assistants to the Amir Fay sal in his capacity as Viceroy. Spoken of in 1930 as a pos sible Minister of Education in a Cabinet then rumoured to be in contempla tion, but. if the rumour was true, jthe project was not pursued. When the Cabinet was eventually organised on its present lines early in 1932 and the Amir Faysal was given the Ministry of the Interior, as well as others, Salih Shata was made his chief assistant in that Ministry and is still the administrative head of it.

I have the honour to inform you that the Saudi, Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Fuad Hamza Bey, arrived in Rome on 9th September and on the following day visited the Exhibition of the Fascist Revolution accompanied by the Italian Minister at Jedda. Later he was the guest at luncheon in the Scacchi Club of Signor Suvich, with whom he subsequently had an official conversation. 2 . On 11th September, His Excellency was received by Signor Mus solini, with whom, according to the official communique, he had a “cordial conversation on problems interesting the friendly relations between the two countries”; and later on the same day the talks were resumed with Signor Suvich. Other points in his programme included a visit to the “Institute per FOriente” and to an open-air opera. After a reception at the Institute, Fuad Hamza Bey left Rome on the evening of 12th September An interview with him subsequently appeared in the “Giornale d’ltalia” but apart from rather fulsome praise of Fascist Italy and the Duce, and the reiterated intention to preserve good relations with this country, it did not contain any statement worthy of special mention.

Letter from His Majesty’s Charge d’affaires, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 2945/196/40, dated the 6th November 1934. I find at present little in the general situation to justify a more formal report, but there are one or two matters which appear to call for mention though perhaps inappropriate to a despatch. Amir Feysal left (with Sheykh’ Abdullah Suleyman) for Riyadh yester day evening, a visit which has been impending, according to report, for some time. It was said he was awaiting the arrival of Talaat Pasha Harb by air from Egypt, but the Pasha has failed to appear (though tents were erected and the landing ground prepared several days ago) and is now said to be due abou*t the 22nd November. Feysal is reported to have been summoned to Riyadh by his father in connexion, the know-alls here would have us believe, with certain differen ces which have been making themselves felt between Feysal and Saud. Jealousy between these two brothers is, I believe, an old story but is said to have grown considerably sharper of late. As I have generally indicated in the Jedda Report for October the reasons given are numerous. Saud is said to be sore that Feysal should have got the lion’s share of the kudos out of the late war with the Yemen- He is jealous, too, of Feysal’s growing popularity in the Hejaz where .the latter’s more easy-going and pleasure- loving temperament suits the public taste more than the Nejdi religious intolerance to which they have been accustomed. Saud may, moreover, have an eye on the possibility of the demise (or abdication) of the King and may distrust the presence of his younger brother, gradually establishing himself more securely in the saddle, in the Hejaz, the chief source of the wealth of Saudi Arabia. He may, also, imagine Feysal’s relations, as Minister for Foreign Affairs and after his journeys abroad, with foreign powers to be specially intimate; and probably has little use for Fuad Hamza and may suspect the tour of European capitals upon which he has recently been engaged. y Feysal, I believe, has denied the report that he goes to Riyadh to be married, and confided to his intimate friend, Suleyman Gabil, recently that he was thoroughly fed up. • I must apologise foij retailing so much gossip, but it is, I feel interest irig and should, I think, be recorded. ’ For the rest, there is nothing fresh to report about the situation at Teima; and Fuad Hamza has still to arrive back frpm his tour (though I gather from a recent despatch from Baghdad that he might go over there first).

Conversation between our Special Correspondent and Fuad Bey Hamza. Q. Will your Excellency tell me in detail what was the aim in present circumstances of your visit to the European capitals ? A . I went to Europe on a private visit to take a rest, but I also took the opportunity of meeting the men of Italy, France and Great Britain of discussing with them questions of interest to His Majesty King Abdul Aziz, and of solving some of the outstanding problems. I visited Italy and met Signor Mussolini. This visit served to confirm the good relations existing between the Italian and Arabian Governments. I visited the French capital and met the men of its Government and spoke to that experienced politician, the late M. Barthou, whose death was a great loss to the French nation. He was an energetic man, and he wisely steered French policy in the stormy sea of politics. I visited the English, capital and met the Hon’ble Sir John Simon, the Foreign Minister, and other men of the British Government. I am glad to be able to declare that we succeeded in overcoming many difficulties and in coming to an understanding about many questions which are of interest to the Arab Saudi and the British Governments. Q . Hejaz being one of the Governments that inaugurated the League of Nations, is it the intention of His Majesty to use that right, having neglected so far to claim it ? A . Hejaz, which was one of the Governments which founded the League of Nations, was then an independent country by itself. Now it is not, 6 3[C) F&amp;POn 1 71 ' j ! ' 1 ' . . 1 Q. But the Government of His Majesty Abdul Aziz has inherited the Hejaz Kingdom! A. If we had inherited that, we should have inherited also some other things which are not in our interest. So is it better not to have inherited anything. Q. Then is it not the intention of the Government of His Majesty to enter the League of Nations ? A - It is possible that this question is now under discussion. Q. What about the negotiations concerning the Hejaz Railway? A. Negotiations on that subject are taking place between the Arabian, French and English Governments. Probably a conference will be held shortly to take a final decision about this railway. Q. Is it not to the interest of Hejaz, Syria and the Moslem world to have the line between Maan and Medina repaired and put into action, and leave other questions to be discussed later ? A. Among other questions considered during the negotiations, which took place a long time ago, was the repairing of the line between Maan and Medina. One of the subjects to be discussed by the conference is the way for securing the necessary funds for repairing this part of the line. • ( 102 ) {Received on 15th Vecember 1934, with Political Secretary's letter No. 48, dated 29th November 1934-) Letter from the British Legation, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 2905/26/82, dated the 2nd November 1934.

Charge d’affaires, Jedda, No. 5/2/60, dated the 23rd, Jusmad ath Thani 1353 (2nd October 1934.). I inform you that the authorities concerned in the northern frontiers of the Government of H. M. the King have a week ago noticed the presence of two aeroplanes of the British Air Force at Thaniya Tarif, north of and one “Marhala” (a day’s journey) distant from Fajr. They have also seen six of the armed soldiers of the Camel Corps of the Transjordan frontier forces. Your honour is not unaware of the fact that the above mentioned place lies within the frontiers of the territories of the Government of H. M. the King and that the presence of aeroplanes and armed forces therein must be regarded as a transgression and violation of the rights of the territories belonging to His Majesty. I am therefore directed to express strong regret at such aggression and to lodge the protect of the Government of H. M, officially for such manifest aggression against their territories. I await adequate satisfaction for this incident and (hope) to learn of the measures which will be taken to avoid its recurrence. j j : .{Received by Air Mail under No. P.

I enclose copy of a interesting letter from Fowle [Enclo 1 to Serial No. (94)], on the question of the reactions in the Gulf to the outcome of the war between Ibn Saud and the Imam. His conversation with the Sheikh of Koweit appears to have confirmed the impression on this subject which he had himself independently formed and which he mentioned to us during the course of the summer. The point is, of course, of importance, since, as Fowle says, “Ibn Saud’s authority over his subjects, especially over the tribal elements^ depends a good deal on prestige”. 2. Ryan has, of course, by now left, and he will no doubt see the copy of Fowle’s letter, which was sent direct to Calvert, on his return to Jedda. (105) {Received on 23rd December 1934, with Political Secretary's letter No. 49, y dated 6th December 1934.) Letter from the Resident, Aden, to the Colonial Office, No. 91, dated the 4th April 1934. I have the honour to refer to your despatch No. 1, dated 4th January 1933 in which you authorised the pavment to His Highness the Sultan of Shehr and Mukalla of the arrears of his stipend for a period of three years onlv from 1st April 1930 to 31st March 1933. The Sultan has been informed of your decision, but he has not yet drawn the amount which you have sanctioned. 2 In your despatch under reference you anticipated that difficulty miuht be experienced in resisting payment of the whole of the arrears which have accruea in the event of the Sultan invoking his Treaty obligations. This difficulty has now arisen, as the Sultan has addressed a letter to me on the 27th February in which he asks for reconsideration of this qrestion on the eround that he is entitled to the full arrears under the terms of his Treatv of 1882 with the British Government, in which there is no stipula tion that he is bound to draw his stipend annually, or that he will be deprived76 of it if he fails to do so. He further represents that his stipend was allowed to fall into arrears because of its small annual amount, that his predecessor Sultan Ghaleb was permitted to draw arrears accumulated for a large number of years, and that neither his predecessor nor he himself was warned that arrears would in future be forfeited. 3. All the Chiefs of the Aden Protectorate, including His Highness the Sultan of Shehr and Mukalla, have now been told that their stipend must be drawn punctually or not at all, but I consider that there is a good deal of force in the Sultan’s contention that a retrospective insistence of this con dition in contradiction of a comparatively recent precedent and without previous intimation of its adoption is opposed to the spirit, if not to the letter, of his Treaty. The existence of the Aden Protectorate is based on mutual obligation established by treaties between His Majesty’s Government and the local Chiefs, and a scruplous observation of the conditions of these treaties is essential to the maintenance of our relationship with them. I feel very strongly that there should never be any doubt that obligations under the treaties will be fully honoured, and I consider that in a case of some uncertainty, such as the present one, it is better to accept rather than to repudiate a claim for which there appears to be a good though perhaps not a conclusive case. For this reason I venture to recommend a considera tion of the orders conveyed to me in your despatch of the 4th January 1933, and the payment of the arrears of stipend due to the Sultan of Shehr and Mukalla in full from 1st October 1917. 4. I base my request primarily on a point of principle., but I desire to add a plea for generous treatment in this case on account of the consistently loyal and helpful attitude of the Mukalla authorities in all matters in which their co-operation or assistance is desired by the Aden Eesidency. This has been notably evident in connection with landing grounds and other facilities for the Royal Air Force in Mukalla territory and its neighbourhood. Mukalla is the most important place and the pivot of our policy in the eastern part of the Protectorate, but its Sultan nevertheless receives one of the smallest of the stipends paid to Protectorate Chiefs, and he is never given money presents such as are often bestowed upon others in the Pro tectorate. The amount of his stipend—Rs. 60 a month—is, in fact, so low that it can be regarded as little more than a token of the mutual rela tionship between him and His Majesty’s Government; and, as such, I con sider that it ought not to be allowed to lapse, even temporarily, in a case such as the one which I now submit for your reconsideration. Enclosure 1 to Serial No. (105). ! i | ‘ Letter from the Treasury, to the Colonial Office, No. S. -32316, dated the 7th November 1934. , . I have laid before the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury + Mr. Cowell’s letter of the 3rd July (37953/34), and subsequent semi-official correspondence, relative to the payment of arrears of stipend claimed by the Sultan of Shehr and Mukalla. In reply, I am to request you to inform Secretary Sir Philip Cunliffe- Lister that, having regard to the terms of the treaty under which this stipend is paid, My Lords are now prepared to agree to the payment of arrears accrued since the accession of ithe present Sultan in 1922, amounting to approximately £675. They note however that Sir Philip Cuniiffe-Lister is advised that, as the treaty provides for a personal payment to the Sultan or other person in possession of the territory in question, in consideration of his personal fulfilment of the obligations imposed on him by Articles 1 and 3 of the treaty, the obligation of His Majesty’s Government is not to be regarded as extending to arrears which his predecessor had waived or failed to secure, and in these circumstances. They are unable to sanction payment of arrears prior to the present Sultan’s accession.My Lords note that savings are available bn the Colonial and Middle Eastern Services Vote from which this payment can be met, and that 0 ^ e ' third of the amount will be recovered from the Government of India under the usual arrangements. / Enclosure 2 to Serial No. (105). Letter from the Colonial Office, to the Resident at Aden, No. 136, DATED THE 23RD NOVEMBER 1934. I have the honour to refer to your despatch No. 91 of the 4th of April ( Serial No. (105)], regarding the arrears of stipend claimed by the Sultan of Shehr and Mukalla, and to inform you that this matter has been further considered in consultation with the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury. 2. The legal position under the Treaty of 1882 has been examined, and 1 am advised that as the Treaty provides for a personal payment to the Sultan or other person in possession of the territory in question, in consi deration of his personal fulfilment of the obligations imposed on him by Articles 1 and 3 ; the Sultan could reasonably claim arrears of stipend which accrued during his own reign; but not arrears which his predecessor had waived or been unable to secure. 3. In these circumstances the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury aoree that the Sultan should be paid the arrears of stipend which have accrued since his accession in June 1922 amounting to approximately £675, but they are unable to sanction payment of arrears prior to that date. I am accordingly to convey to you my sanction for the issue to the Sultan of the arrears of the stipend from the date of his assumption of Chieftainship in June 1922. 4 . In order to prevent any accumulation of arrears of stipends in future, I consider that all stipends should be paid automatically each year without awaiting applications from the stipendiary chiefs. By this method the strict obligations of Government to the Chiefs will be discharged and the accumulation of arrears will be prevented. Unless you see any objection I have to request that you will arrange for this procedure to be adopted in future.

We have come across rather a curious point in connection with the division of agencies. In a Gazetteer issued by Geo. Philip and Son, Ltd., it is stated that Aden,including the Protectorate of Perim, is officially part of the Bombay Presidency, that the Government is administered jointly by the India Office and the Foreign Office through a Political Resident, and that the principal coinage is the Indian rupee. In appointing agents we have hitherto considered Aden and Perim as a separate territory from the Bombay Presidency, and are anxious to continue doing so, nut if the official status is as above, it will be necessary for us to make a distinction within the agency agreements we have. We should very much appreciate any comments which would show whether they may legitimately be considered quite separately from the agency point of view.

Although I had received no communication from the Saudi authorities in respect of this incident and although a period of three weeks had elapsed since it took place, I judged it advisable to inform them without delay of this unavoid able trespass on their territory. 1 feel, however, that it is unlikely that the delay on the part of the Royal Air Force authorities in the Persian Gulf in reporting tins violation will escape the notice of the Saudi Government. 3.

I understand that the defect was repaired and the aircraft proceeded to Bahrain the same morning.

With reference to my despatch No. 341 (2992/5/49) of the 16th November [Serial No. (1)], with which I transmitted to you a copy of my despatch No. 2991/5/ 49 [Enclosure 2 to Serial No. (1)] of the same date to H. M.

The tone of the Saudi note, it will be observed, is stiff and a definite under standing regarding incidents of this nature is regarded by the Saudi Arab Govern ment as essential. That some hardening in their attitude was to be expected was foreshadowed by Sir Andrew Ryan in his despatch No. 206 of the 3rd July last [endorsement to Serial No. (6) in File No. 7-N/34)] and in an instance of this sort, where a considerable delay supervened before the incident was brought to the notice of H. M.’s Ambassador at Baghdad, is scarcely a matter for surprise. 3. I am at present unable to say when the discussion of this question is likely to commence. Fuad Bey Hamza has not yet returned to this country and though he might possibly arrive tomorrow, the Saudi Ministry for Foreign Affairs, I learn to-day in connection with another matter, are still in ignorance of the date of his arrival. 4.

Letter from His Majesty’s Charge d’affaires, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 358, dated the 4th December 1934. With reference to Sir Andrew Ryan’s despatch No. 219 of the 9th July last, in which he reported the departure of Fuad Bey Hamza from Jedda, I have the* honour to inform you that Fuad Bey returned to this country on the 2nd December. Accompanied by his brother Said Hamza, he travelled from Suez by an Italian ship of the Tirrenian Line and on arrival was met on board by Sheykh Ali Taha, the Deputy Governor of Jedda and Jedda representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affiairs, and by Signor Persico, the Italian Charge d’Affaires. I have reason to believe that several of my colleagues attended at the Quarantine Quay to welcome Fuad Bey on landing, although no formal notification of his arrival had been com municated, as far as I am aware, by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Deputy Minister was also met on landing by a number of local notables. I understand that he attended a lunch given in his honour by his Syrian compatriots and in the ev ning left for Mecca. 2 . Fuad Bey s return, therefore, took place under more cheerful auspices than those which marked his departure last July. I am not yet aware of his immediate movements, whether he will remain in Mecca for the present, or whether he will, as upon his return from abroad last year, go direct to Riyadh to see the King. The latter alternative seems not improbable, as Amir Feysal is also at present with Ibn Saud at Riyadh.

Sts******* . Malalia. 13. Arrived and anchored at 1030 on 22nd October. The Commanding Officer called on the Wazir, Salem Ahmed Alkoati, His Highness the Sultan having sailed for India some ten days previously. The Wazir, who has only held the post for nine months (i.e., subsequent to the last visit of a Red Sea Sloop in January 1934), is dull and unprepossessing in comparison with his predecessor. He returned the visit at 1530 on the same day, and was accorded a salute of 11 guns on his departure. 14. Business in the town appears to be flourishing ; the bazaar is full and active, while the inhabitants present a remarkably cheerful and well-fed appear ance, the latter in marked contrast to that observed in most South Arabian ports. It is understood tha ; the construction of the motor road to the Hadramaut, referred to in previous Reports of Proceedings, has made little, if any, progress in the mountain districts. 15. On the 23rd I visited the English School, by the invitation of the Indian Schoolmaster, Ibrahim Soogan, who for many years had taught in the Danish Mission School in The Crater, Aden. The school, which was established some 6 months ago by the Sultan, is row attended three times weekly by about 60 boys, ranging in age from 8 to 16 years, of whom a third are Indians. After the inspection of the Guard of Boy Scouts, an Address of Welcome was read by the senior student, and was followed by a demonstration of the principal subjects of instruction. Proceedings terminated by the singing, with much zest, of the National Anthem, first in English and then in Arabic. In a short speech I congratulated the Schoolmaster and his pupils on the results achieved in so short a time, and laid emphasis on the great value and universal appeal of the Boy Scouts’ Movement. In the evening the Schoolmaster and nine of the senior Scouts came on board and were shown round the ship. 16. It had been arranged with the Chief C mmissioner that a short visit should be paid to Bal Haf while on passage to Aden (Bir Ali was not included, as the Sheikh is at present in bad odour), but on the receipt of instructions (Admiralty message timed 1416/20) that Their Lordships were to be kept informed of the details of the reception ceremonies proposed for the forthcoming visit of His Majesty the King of Italy to Aden, it became necessary to allow a larger margin of time for consult ing the Chief Commissioner and transmitting the required intelligence. With his concurrence, Bal Haf Was therefore omitted from the programme, and “ Pen zance ” sailed at 0415 on the 24th for Aden direct, arriving at 0700 on the following day. -Aden. 17. The forthcoming visit of H. M. Tae King of Italy was immediately dis cussed with the Chief Commissioner, when it was found that some uncertainty prevailed as to the policy whi h should be adopted for his reception. On the one hand a telegram from the Secretary of State for India (No. 2455—■ the equivalent of A miralty message timed 1416/20) indicated the pleasure of His Britannic Majesty to be that full honours and compliments should be rendered, whether His Majesty was travelling incognito or otherwise, provided that his Standard was flying, while a further message ^No. 2484) stated that such would be the case. On the other hand, the Italian Consul had received information that the Stand aid would not be flown, and that His Majesty desired to land privately* He wa 8 therefore requested to obtain confirmation of this fact, pointing out that it was at variance with the information received from London, and to st te that should the Standard not be flown, no royal honours would be accorded (“ Penzance's message timed 2132/25.) 18. On the following day (26th) the Secretary of State informed the Chief Commissioner (telegram No. 2521) that no notification had been received of any change in the King’s plans. Further passages in the message were taken to indicate that the intimation that the Standard would be flown had originated from His Majesty and had been accompanied by a personal letter of thanks to His Britannic Majesty. This message was followed and reinforced on 27th by a further one (No. 2537), stating that information from His Britannic Majesty’s Embassy at Rome was to the effect that Italian officials stated that it was His Majesty’s invariable practice to fly bis Standard, and that, in their opinion, the Italian Consul had been misin formed. It was conside ed by the Embassy that Italian wishes would be met by the reception of His Majesty with a gun salute, and that, as he wished his visit to be private, he should be spared all imnecessary ceremony ashore, other than the parading of a Guard of Honour. On the same day, however, the Consul obtained a positive statement from the Roval Yacht that the Standard would not be flown. As this was in answer to the enquiries referred to in paragraph 17, it was held to constitute a clear indication that His Majesty did not desire to be received with any ceremony, and the Consul was therefore asked to state that in deference to these wishes honours would not be rendered. The main situation thus appeared to be clear, and was reported in my message timed 1237/27. 19. A minor complication, however, arose from the fact that at a Residency Meeting that evening (27th) the Consul announced that the escorting cruiser “ Gorizia ” was flying the flag of Admiral of Division Conte Luigi Mira glia. In the absence of the Royal Standard it appeared to me evident that his flag should be saluted by “ Penzance ”, although the presence of His Majesty, admittedly in a private capacity, made such a procedure appear somewhat illogical unless what l take to be the strict interpretation of the situation, ws., that in the absence of the Standard, His Majesty was not, from a ceremonial aspect, present in the yacht, was constantly borne in mind. The Consul was therefore asked to ascertain the wishes of the Rear Admiral as regards the marks of respect to be paid to him and I reported the matter in my message timed 0107/28, receiving in reply Admiralty message 1352/28. 20 . On the evening of the 28th I was summoned to a further conference at the Residency at which the Chief Commissioner quoted three further messages receiv ed during that day from the Secretary of State (Nos. 2541, 2542 and 2554). These were to the effect that the earlier reports that the Standard would not be flown has caused considerable surprise in London and that His Britannic Majesty s Embassy at Rome had notified that the Master of Ceremonies, in a personal inter view. had again emphasised that His Majesty invariably flew his Standard and would expect gun salutes, and, if he landed, a Guard of Honour, notwithstand ing that his visit was of a private nature.I &gt; 6 21 . Influenced by these repeated expressions of the opinions held by London and Rome as to His Majesty’s wishes, and taking into account the complication referred to in paragraph 19 (particularly as regards its effect on the laige native population of Aden who, being unable to appreciate the circumstances of an un official visit, would regard the omission of Royal Honours as most unusual), it was decided that full compliments should be paid, it being held that in the un usual circumstances of a Sovereign paying a visit to a foreign military port of a status such as that of Aden, without flying his Standard although under naval escort, an excess of ceremony was to be preferred to a deficiency. In his advance message of welcome which he sent that evening, Sir Bernard Reilly therefore stated his desire to render the usual honours on the arrival of the Yacht, unless the King desired to the contrary, to which His Majesty replied with an expression of thanks. Apart from the fact that it was evidently impossible for His Majesty’s Ship under my command not to fire a Royal Salute when the military forces were render ing this honour, but instead to salute the flag of the Rear Admiral, I myself con curred in the decision recorded above. The rendering of other naval honours, in my opinion, followed as a necessary corollary, and arrangements were therefore made to dress ship, man ship, and cheer. It will be appreciated that these decisions taken only a few hours before the expected arrival of His Majesty could not under the circumstances be submitted to Their Lordships for prior approval. Monday, 29th October. 22. H. M. S. “ Penzance ”, the military signal stations and merchant vessels in port dressed ship overall at 0800. On approaching the Fairway Buoy “ Gorizia ” saluted the Country, which was returned by the Marbut Battery. The Royal Yacht “ Savoia ”, followed by “Gorizia” entered the Inner Harbour at 1330, when a Royal Salute, synchronised by V/S signals, was fired by “ Penzance ” and the shore battery. On the near approach of “ Savoia ”, “ Penzance ” manned ship, rendered military honours and cheered ship. “ Savoia ” proceeded to No. 4 buoy, head west, and was thus in close proxi mity to “ Penzance ” (No. 2 buoy, head east), while “ Gorizia ” proceeded to No. 2 fuelling berth, military honours being paid by “ Penzance ” as she passed. The Royal Standard was not flying, neither was it hoisted at any time through out the visit. As far as could be seen, no marks of respect were rendered by c ' Gorizia ” when passing the Yacht, either on entering harbour or on departure. 23. The Chief Commissioner, flying his Flag and accompanied by Group Captain (?. F. A. Portal, D. S. 0. M. C. (Officer Commanding British Forces), proceeded at once on board “ Savoia ” to offer his respects and welcome to His Majesty. In the evening, Sir Bernard Reilly, the Group Captain, Lieutenant-Colonel, N. M. McLeod (Commanding British Troops) and the Aide de Camp had the honour of dining with His Majesty; these invitations had been issued by the Consul. 24. Before the operation of securing was completed the Officer of the Guard from “ Gorizia ” called on me (having passed “ Penzance’s ” Officer of the Guard between the two ships) and presented a request from Rear Admiral Conte Luigi Miraglia that in view of the short duration of the stay I should refrain from call ing on him. 25. A police boat patrolled round the Yacht during the whole of the visit. Tuesday, 30th October. 26. As on the preceding day, “ Penzance ”, the shore signal stations and merchant shipping dressed ship overall at 0800. His Majesty landed at the Prince of Wales’ Pier at 0700, and was received with a Royal Guard provided by the British troops and Royal Air Force.7 A field battery of the Royal Artillery was temporarily sited on the Post Office Pier, and fired a Royal Salute as His Majesty stepped ashore. “ Penzance mounted a Guard of Honour, but no ceremony was observed in ^ Gorizia . 27. After inspecting the Guard, His Majesty accompanied by his suite and by the Chief Commissioner and certain British officials made a tour of the town by car, visiting first the Tanks in the Crater and then proceeding to the Italian Salt Works where the Italian staff were presented. Here His Majesty displayed his remarkable memory when, on beirg informed of the regiments in which certain members of the staff had fought during the Great War, he recalled in many instances the names of the Commanding Officers. The Settlements Gardens at Sheikh Othman were then inspected, after which the procession returned to the Residency. Here a number of other officers and officials, among them myself, had the honour of being presented to His Majesty, with each of whom he found time to have a short conversation. His Majesty speaks excellent English. After light refreshments His Majesty re-embarked, the Guard of Honour being now provided by the Aden Levies. A Royal Salute was again fired by the field battery. “ Penzance’s ” guard paraded, and on this occasion it appeared that a Guard was also mounted in “ Gorizia ”, although elsewhere the work of the ship proceed ed without apparent interruption. 28. “ Gorizia ” proceeded to sea at 1130, followed by “Savoia” at 1210 . As the Yacht passed “ Penzance ” the same honours were rendered as on her arrival, and as she reached the entrance to the Inner Harbour, Royal Salutes were fired by the ship and Marbut battery. 29. The Chief Commissioner informs me that from his bearing and g *neral demeanour throughout the visit he is confident that His Majesty was genuinely pleased with the arrangements made for his reception ; this opinion was fully confirmed by subsequent reports from the Consul, to whom His Majesty and lead ing members of his entourage had expressed their complete satisfaction. Sir Bernard has since received a telegram from London, expressing His Majesty’s Government’s approval of the arrangements made, and congratulating him on his tactful handling of the situation. ********:*£!!:*:*:* sjs ( 6 ) (Received on 2nd February 1935 y with Political Secretary's letter No. 3, dated the 17th January 1935.) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter dated the 11th January 1935. Letter from His Majesty’s Charge d’Affairs, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 349, dated the 27th November 1934. With reference to my despatch No. 360 of the 12th December 1933 [Serial No. (12) in F. No. 17-N./34], relative to the visit to this country by air of an Egyptian commercial and financial mission headed by Muhammad Talaat Harb Pasha, 1 have the honour to inform you that on the 22nd November a similar mission arrived from Egypt by aeroplane, almost a year since the first visit was made. The mem bers of the mission this year are Midhat Yeghen Pasha, chairman of directors of the Banque Misr ; Muhammad Talaat Harb Pasha, deputy chairman of directors of the Banque Misr and Egyptian Senator; Fuad Bey Sultan and Ismail Bey Jad Barakat, members of the board of directors of Banque Misr; Kemal Bey Aloui, manager of Misr Airwork, S.A.E. ; and Muhammad-al-Masiri Bey, manager of the Egyptian Steam Navigation Company. The party, which is considerably stronger in its composition than that of last year, arrived towards sunset in two aeroplanes, and were officially welcomed on arrival by the Amir of Jedda, who was accompanied by local officials, and notables and members of the Egyptian consulate.8 2 . I understand that the two aeroplanes, a De Havilland Oregon (as last year) and a Tigar Moth, made the journey from Egypt in one day, leaving Cairo at 5 A.M, r an improvement on last year’s performance, when the flight was made in two stages. Short halts were made this year at Tor, Wejh and Yanbu. The pilots are Mr. G. S. Brown (flight-lieutenant R. A. F. Reserve) and Ismail Effendi Sidky. 3 . Talaat Pasha, who called on His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires the day after his arrival, left with his associates for Mecca by car on the 25th November. He is expected to leave here on the 28th November by air for Yanbu, whence he will visit Medina by car, and return to Egypt by air on the 1st December. 4 . I hope to be in a position to report more fully in due course on the objects of this second visit to the Hejaz. Generally, I think, it may be assumed that the mission will interest itself, as last year, in makirg arrangements for the reception of Egyptian pilgrims coming to this country by the Egyptian steamers Zamzam and Nil, and in taking further steps to establish here branches of the Banque Misr. 5 . The mission do not appear to be the guests of the Saudi Government this year, and whilst in Jedda have been accommodated in the new premises taken by the Banque Misr during the past year, which were originally intended, it is believed, for the Soviet Legation. Generally, it may be said that less publicity has been given to this visit than to its counterpart of last year ; I have still to hear of the broadcast distribution of piece-goods, etc., of Egyptian manufacture, whilst this year the aeroplanes have not been activly engaged in treating the Jedda popu lace to joy-rides. 6 . I was informed by my Egyptian colleague, some time before the arrival of the mission, that Talaat Harb Pasha had requested permission of the Saudi authorities to be allowed to fly to Riyadh to meet the King. I understand that the Saudis have been unable to accede to this request. 7 . I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majest 's Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Department of Overseas Trade, and to the Acting High Commissioner for Egypt. Enclosure to Serial No. (6). Mr. Calvert to Sir John Simon,.—(Received December 18.) Letter from His Majesty’s Charge d’affaires, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 360, dated the 4th December 1934. With reference to my despath No. 349 of the 27th November last [Serial No. (6)] relative to the Egyptian commercial and financial mission to this country, I have the honour to report that Talaat Harb Pasha, Midhat Yaghen Pasha and party (with the exception of Kemal Bey Alui, who left the same day for Egypt by Khedivial mail steamer) left for Yanbu by air on the 28th November and after visiting Medina by car resumed their return journey to Egypt on the last December. 2 . Talaat Pasha's visit this year is shorter than was expected and only two whole days were put in at Mecca. By some this is thought to be due to his dis satisfaction at being refused permission to fly to Riyadh to see the King. His donations to schools and hospitals were on a modest scale, according to report, but free distribution as charity of piece-goods and other Egyptian manufactures, which had not taken place when I wrote my despatch under reference, was subsequently undertaken on behalf of the Egyptian mission by the Jedda municipality on the 4th December. 3 . I learn that Talaat Pasha was primarily interested in arranging with the Saudi authorities for further facilities this year for Egyptian pilgrims. The ship- ing agents will continue to be Messrs. Haji Abdullah Ali Reza and Co., according to their own account, and financial arrangements, which are said to include the perception of Saudi pilgrim dues from, the individual pilgrims by Banque Misr and payment to the Saudi Arab Government in a lump sum, will be handled by Banque Misr or separately appointed agents here. Two large motor-launches, to seat 100 passengers each, are to be brought here by Banque Misr in order to facilitate the transport of pilgrims from the outer anchorage in the heavy seas. The present charges for sambuqs are to remain undisturbed, and the local interests involved9 are not to suffer. Indeed, it appears that Talaat Pasha has been at pains to assure local merchants and shippers that his objects are not to deprive them of the bene fits they now enjoy from the pilgrimage, but to ensure greater comfort for Egyptian pilgrims, and increase their numbers, which this, year he estimates at about 8,000. Pilgrims of the wealthier sort are to be accommodated in the new premises, in both Jedda and Mecca, now partly occupied by the offices of Banque Misr. 4 . It is stated with some confidence by Mr. Philby that the Saudi Govern ment have obtained from Talaat Pasha a loan, probably small and probably in the nature of an advance on account of pilgrims’ dues, which will be paid by Egyptian pilgrims coming on Haj. 5 Two small steamers, the Mariut and Manzaleh, flying the Egyptian flag, have called at Jedda during the past few days from Suez and have proceeded to Port Sudan. They have carried small quantities of cargo, and are stated by Messrs. Haji Abdullah Ali Reza and Co., who have been appointed agents by Talaat Pasha, to be testing the possibilities of a more regular service. 6 . The transport of pilgrims by air was not pursued, in view of the quarantine and other difficulties in the way. The Saudi authorities were not very ready to discuss the question of air development with members of the mission, as I nave already reported in my despatch No. 351 of the 30th November The question of a concession for the construction of a railway between Mecca and Jedda is said to have been touched on, but quite tentatively and without further more serious consideration. . 7 . I am sending copies of this despatch to the Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Department of Overseas Trade and to the Acting High Commis sioner at Cairo.

The Committee has received a report that the Imam of Yemen has issued an order imposing severe restrictions on his Jewish subjects who wish to leave for Aden or other places abroad ; and further that the desire of such Jews to emigrate is due to their alleged persecution in the Yemen.

With regard to the reports current here during the summer that Khalid el Qar qam is interested in the Possibility of obtaining the Jedda-Mecca Railway &lt; oncession, to which an allusion is made in the fourth paragraph of my despatch under reference I gather from Mr. Philby that he is unawa e of this report and regards it as unlikely to be true. 3.

With reference to your despatch No. 394(E.-6322/2429/25) of the 2nd Novem ber relative to the interest evinced by the Italian Government in the recent visit to London of Fuad Bey Hamza, I have the honour to inform you that in the course of a conversation on the 8th November my Italian colleague, Signor Persico, made a somewhat vague allusion to our interests on the Arabian shores of the Persian Gulf and asked me whether it was true that a conference was to be held shortlv over there. He continued interrogatively and with an air of ingenuous innocence. those parts are now very important, are they not ” ? As his reference to the subject WaS lat 16r casual 1 was a ^ e to re ply evasively and he did not pursue the 2. Signor Persico is still fairly new to this post and from the few an unimpor tant conversations I have bad with him since his return from Europe gives me the impression of being only superficially acquainted with questions to which he has always spontaneously, referred. For example, he has twice adverted to the ques tion of meeting between Ibn Saud and Amir Abdullah of Trans-Jordan, professing to have seen passing references to this subject in the press of neighbouring countries The second occasion he mentioned this matter was during the conversation of the 8th November, when I felt myself able to reply somewhat more explicitly that there was no immediate prospect of a meeting. 3 1 : ^ hen Signor Persico left Jedda on leave of absence on the 8th July last he travelled, to 1 ort Sudan in the same Khedivial Mail steamer as Fuad Bey Hamza and I believe they continued their journey together by an Italian steamer as far as 1 if s Slnc ® avowed that he had frequent opportunities for conversation with huad Bey, and his present curiosity in regard to Saudi Arab affairs in the 1 ersian Gulf may have its origin m that association during the voyage or on the other hand, may perhaps have received a stimulus from reports of Signor Fracassi’s November 0118 ^ ^ ^° reign 0ffice &gt; whic ^ could have reached him here by the 8th Romt 1 am SendinS &amp; C ° Py ° f tHiS des P atch t0 His Majesty’s Ambassador at ( 10 ) (Received on 23rd February 1935 with Political Secretary's Leiter No. 6. dated 7th February 1935.) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter, dated the 1935 . Letter from His Majesty’s Charge d’affaires, Jedda, to the Foreign Office i\0. 365, DATED THE 9TH DECEMBER 1934. I have the honour to inform you that my Frencli colleague, M. Roger Maigret who, as you are aware, is Charge d’Affaires en of the French consulate here’,12 informed me in the course of conversation yesterday that his Government now proposed to raise their mission in Saudi Arabia to the status of a Legation. Budget ary provision had been made, and he expected the change to date from the 1st January next. He stated, in answer to my enquiry, that the head of the post would hold the rank of Minister, and that he would remain on in that capacity. On my congratulating him, he explained that although he understood privately that his appointment had been contemplated by his Ministry in any case, yet Fuad Bey Hamza had interested himself with the French Government to secure his selection. The elevation of the French representation here, and the appointment of M. Maigret, mav well have been, although the latter did not say so, amongst the questions dis cussed with the French Government by Fuad Bey Hamza during his recent visit to Europe. 2 . M. Maigret, who, as is his wont, has remained virtually invisible during the summer, is again becoming locomotive, as he proposes to leave Jedda within a few days for a three weeks’ visit to the Yemen. Upon his return from Sana, he hopes, before the Haj, to pay a brief visit to Syria to meet the High Commissioner there. 3 . I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty s Chief Commissioner at Aden and His Majesty’s consul-general at Beirut. (H) (Received on 16th February 1935 with Political Secretary's letter No. 6, dated 31st January 1935.) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter, dated the 24th January 1935. Letter from His Majesty’s Charge d’affaires, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 370, dated the 11th December 1934. Mr. Calvert to Sir John Simon .— {Received December 31.) I have the honour to refer to my despatch No. 351 of the 5th Decern bei 1933 [Serial No. (6) in F. No. 17-N./34], in which I ventured to submit a short review of the general financial situation in this country. I a gain propose to attempt, with the modest material available in a country where statistics of any value are unknown, an appreciation of the general financial and economic condition of Saudi Arabia at the present time. 2 . Since the despatch under reference was written, the intervening months have witnessed little real alleviation of the financial difficulties with which Ibn Sand was then findiug himself increasingly confronted. The principal dram on his resources, due to the long-drawn struggle with the Yemen, the necessity of pro viding for an army in the field and at the same time of cementing the loyalty of tribal leaders in Nejd by subsidies and supplies in kind, can scarcely have di minished until the operations came to a successful conclusion and the troops returned to their own country during July and August. Even then demobilisation involved the grant of gratuities in rials and in kind to each individual soldier, a process which began at Taif upon the immediate return of the troops and continued at Riyadh until mid-November. Mr. Philby estimates the cost to Ibn Saud of these gratuities alone to be in the neighbourhood of £100,000 gold. Thus the whole period under review has been one of abnormal military expenditure, in prosecuting the war and, at its conclusion, in paying in hard cash a handsome insurance pre mium against tribal discontent at a lootless victory. 3 . It may not unnaturally be asked where are the resources upon which the King could draw so liberally. Mr. Philby is convinced that the explanation lies in the receipt of a war indemnity from the Imam of the Yemen. I am not alone in considering this view difficult to accept, and incline to the belief that the King has found himself compelled, in order to content his returning soldiery, to make serious inroads upon the Royal Treasury, a reservoir of unknown dimensions. 4 . That the Saudi Exchequer could have proved of much assistance can hardly be expected, even in the resourceful hands of the Minister of finance. Little addi tional taxation, except in the almost negligible form of a stamp duty, was imposed and in spite of certain reports to the contrary, no resort was made, as far as can be ascertained, to the exaction of forced loans.13 rv (g) c 5. The revenue, which in the despatch under reference was represented as exiguous, has probably shown some improvement, but not of a nature to offset expenditure. The pilgrimage of 1934 exceeded 25,000, in comparison with 20,000 of the year before and pilgrim dues to the Government and activity in the bazaars were stimulated in proportion. The prospects for the forthcoming pilgrimage are still conjectural, but it may not be excessive optimism to expect a slight increase again in 1935. The remarks in last year’s report in regard to the general level of poverty of latter-day pilgrims still apply, although the efforts of Talaat Harb Pasha, upon whose activities I have reported elsewhere, are directed towards in ducing Egyptians of the wealthier sort to perform the Haj. 6. Customs receipts are still one of the several urkown factors in Saudi Arabia’s economic equation. One might perhaps hazaid the opinion that there has this year been a slight improvement. The small increase in the pilgrimage and the partial liquidation of old stocks of goods in the hands of local merchants must have exerted a favourable influence. Receipts, however, are mortgaged as has been now the practice for some years by the system of drafts to which a reference was made in the despatch under reference. 7. The Saudi Government’s revenue has been augmented this year, it is stated, by the receipt during the early summer of £20,000 gold from the Standard Oil Company of California, a sum believed to represent the second instalment of the initial loan promised by the company under the terms of their Hasa oil con cession. A further loan, said to be very small, is reported to have been obtained in November from Talaat Harb Pasha, and is thought probably to be secured on Saudi pilgrim dues, which will be paid by Egyptians during the forthcoming Haj. Mr. Philby, at any rate, was made happy by being paid “ £2,000 or £3,000,” half in cash and half in a draft on Messrs. Haji Abdullah Ali Ridha and Co., confidential agents and importers to the Saudi authorities, not in respect, I understand, of out standing debts, but to finance the import of motor vehicles in accordance with his concession. 8 . Indeed, the position of the Saudi Government in regard to both their internal and foreign, obligations is'as unsatisfactory as ever. Certainly no attempt has been made during the year under review to meet the long outstanding debts due to His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India, and Ibn Saud appears unlikely to manifest any great readiness to do so in the near future. 9. The Minister of Finance has continued to pursue a policy of rigid economy in Government expenditure, although the opinion has been heard that money, for day to day requirements of an essential nature, is not so tight as was the case a year ago. Official salaries are still seriously in arrear and for more than the first six months of the Arabic year 1353 (until the end of October) Government servants had received a bare two months’ salary, and that at the “ par ” rate of 10 rials to 110 piastres miri gold (£l gold), whereas the current rate for rials had fluctuated between 24 and 22 rials to the gold pound. 10. Saudi currency during the year has remained relatively steady and did not show any marked tendency to depreciate after the last pilgrimage, as I anticipated in my despatch under reference. The rial rate varied with in the limits indicated above, and at the time of writing is 22, betraying again the customary appreciation which marks the arrival of pilgrims from abroad. 11. The general tone of trade in theHejaz is stated to be somewhat healthier, the manager of the Dutch banking concern here, the Nederlandsche Handel-Maats- chappij, stating that during the past year there had been slightly more movement and much less reluctance on the part of merchants to take up bills. This applied particularly to the past six months. I am indebted to him for the following figures compiled by himself and, he insists, very tentative, of the imports and exports for the Arabic years 1351 and 1352 :— 1351. 1352. £ sterling. £ sterling. Imports 2,028,000 1,657,850 Exports .. . • • • • • . • • • 150,685 Piece-goods and flour, amongst the more important commodities, showed an in crease' in 1352 over 1351, most others falling away in the second year. The number MS89FL&gt; Di 14 of different lieadiixgs of commodities imported was only 108 in 1352 as compared with 149 in 1351, These figures, partial and approximate though they may be and although they relate, except for the last part of 1352, to the years prior to the period covered by this survey, are nevertheless of some interest. 12 . The picture drawn in the foregoing paragraphs may indicate a far from satisfactory condition, but it is not one of wholly unrelieved gloom. Whilst there is still considerable and serious destitution amongst the poorer classes, which the distribution of food and clothing by Ibn Sand and the charity of the well-disposed do little to alleviate, the cost of living is not appreciably higher to the Hejazi. Rents, on the other hand, have fallen considerably in Mecca and Jedda, and, in the latter town, building of new houses, in itself not a symptom of economic depression, is going on on all hands. Rains in the Hejaz have been plentiful everywhere during the autumn, and reports are satisfactory from many parts of Nejd. Ibn Sand therefore is issuing, it is announced, seed to cultivators and a good harvest in due course will do much to repair the ravages of past privations. 13.

Demi-official letter from the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, to the India Office, No. 163-S., dated the 31st January 1935. I was interested to see that in the Kuwait Intelligence Summary No. 1 of 1935, paragraph 6(d) confirmed Philby’s opinion given in paragraph 300 of Jedda Report for December 1934 that Ibn Saud was incurring some unpopularity by wasting his time limiting instead of attending to business. 2 . Paragraph 6 (g) also confirmed the statement in the same paragraph of the Report that the rumours of jealousy between Faisal and Saud were at least ex aggerated. 3. Paragraph 6(h), however, if correct, indicates that there is a serious rift in the Saudian lute between Ibn Saud and his brother, Mohammad, and this is possible as being more or less in the nature of things amongst Arabs. On the Arab coast of the Gulf, for instance, where enmity exists in a Shaikhly family, more often than not it is at its acutest betwen the Ruler and one of his brothers.

Driving to the Palace in the courtyard of which another Guard was parad ed, I was shown into the presence of the Amir, Seyyid Abdullah al Wazir, who received me with much friendliness and every appearance of genuine pleasure. This was the first occasion on which I had met His Excellency, as Penzance had sailed for Malta before he assumed command of the town in early July. His Excellency begged to be excused from returning my call in person, as he was carry ing out a preliminary fast in preparation for the more serious business of Ramadan and feared the effects of the prolonged boat passage to and from the ship under the prevailing weather conditions. These were, indeed such that I readily agreed and suggested that, in the interests of his deputies, the return ceremony should in any case be deferred until the weather moderated. y ^ the ship of 2 sheep, beef, 30 dozen bananas, 30 dozen eggs. 10 bags of coffee, vegetables and fruit was received from the Amir during the after noon, to whom a return present of tinned fruit was sent, accompanied by a suitable letter of thanks.

The improved standard of play among the habitues, a new box of balls and a locally constructed net of striking colour bore witness to the continued popularity of the game, which is such that even the re-surfacing of the court itself is seriously mooted. *********** 13.

The first relates to enlistment in the ranks and contains the conditions and terms of service, whilst the second announces the establishment, as from the 16th January, 1935, of a military school at Mecca, where candidates for commissioned rank are to pursue a three years’ course of training. 2. This evidence of Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman’s determination to strengthen and improve the present standing army of Saudi Arabia is of considerable interest. The development may be the fruit of experience gained during the war with the \ emen, though I am unable to believe that the Saudi regular forces are to be largely increased. The tribes, and notably the Ikhwan wdll afways be Ibn Saud s most effective and least expensive military weapon. Enclosure 1 in No. 1.

Relations between Saudi Arabia and the Yemen, since the recent dispute, have to all appearances pursued an uneventful course and have ceased to occupy the forefront of public attention locally. Nevertheless reports, vague but persistent, have not been wanting that all is still not well in the Yemen. Frontier difficulties are hinted at, and perhaps somewhat exaggerated stories are current of the restiveness of the Seif-ul-Islam Ahmad, said to be under arms still at Sada and chafing under the restrictions imposed by his father the Imam. 2. I have been disposed to attach little importance to these rumours, and it is perhaps unnecessary to treat them seriously. My French colleague, M. Maigret, spoke to me yesterday, however, on this subject, and whilst admitting that his own information was indefinite, expressed the opinion that there undoubtedly did exist trouble it was, at present, difficult to diagnose. He hoped to leave Jedda shortly on a three weeks’ visit to Sana, and expected to be able to arrive at a more accurate appreciation of the situation in the Yemen during that time. 3. The unrest may be of purely internal significance, and may be a natural reaction after the Imam’s ill-success in the late war with Saudi Arabia. The press of both countries have, however, not entirely allayed misgivings recently by protesting with vigour that the two countries are now on the most friendly terms, and denying with emphasis the “ false reports ” put about by interested persons to the contrary. The Umm-al-Qura of the 23rd November quoted an article from the Sana newspaper the Iman in which reports of the concentration of troops on the Saudi-Yemen frontier were categorically denied. Peace and tranquility prevailed ; conditions had returned to normal; and concord reigned between the “ two Moslem sects ” (presumably the Zeidi and Shafi sects of the Yemen). From the Hejazi press, the Iman continued, it was understood that a similarly fortunate situation existed in this country. The Uynm-al-Qura delightedly welcomed the article with lengthy variations on the themes of Arab brotherhood, the Treaty of Taif and the wiles of unscrupulous mischief-makers inspired by hatred and jealousy of the Arabs and of Islam. I do not propose to transmit to you a translation of this article. 4. It may not be out of place here to inform you, in regard to the Saudi-Yemen treaty settlement, of the insistence with which Mr. Philby continues to express his conviction that Ibn Saud did in fact receive a war indemnity from the Imam. He has more than once reverted to the subject. Ibn Saud, Mr. Philby stated quite recently, has for some two or three months been paying daily to his tribal visitors at Riyadh (as I have recorded in Jedda reports for October and November last) large sums in cash and kind, which my informant estimated at MS89FD a) 19 H B f!i rly TK rie « d1 ^ terms r*, h Ibn Saud &gt; but when in 1926 he attempted to visit the licjaz, Ibn Sand nevertheless politely requested him not to InnH TT • ed^iy.ndH.es at Beirut.

In or about 1917 he was appointed Grand Sheriff of Mecca by the Ottoman Government, to supersede King Hussein, who had gone over to the Allies. He was, however, naturally unable to take up his post in the Hejaz which was in revolt against the Turks. Early in 1926 he tried to obtain British support in obtaining the post of Regent or Governor of the Hejaz under King tbn Saud, who had by that time driven King Hussein’s family out of Arabia but His Majestv s Government were unwilling to intervene in a politico-religious question of this kind he appears to have been, and certainly claimed to be, on fairly friendly terms with Ibn Saud although, when he attempted in 1926 to pay a visit to the Hejaz Ibn Saud politely requested him not to do so. We have no knowledge of any subsidy or promise of a subsidy to him from Ibn Saud, apart from the complaint contained in Princess Fatma’s letter. We have referred this point to Sir Andrew Ryan at Jedda, who has some personal knowledge of the family : it need not how- evd affect the question of the reply to be returned to the Princess. Since 1920 he Sherif has lived at Beirut with his English (or Irish) wife (nee Dunn) whom he married at Constantinople. He has several sons, the eldest of whom is married to a daughter of the er-Sultan of Turkey, while another studied at St Andrew’s university. a We have nothing against the Sherif, who, so far as we know, is a respectable person and is genuinely in reduced circumstances. On the other hand, we have no political reason for wishing to assist him, and in fact anv assistance which could be construed as many way coming from a British official source might prove embarras- Mng.

Perera, Crescent Hotel, Aden, who has applied to them for their agency. A copy of their letter is enclosed.2 . As no report regarding this individual is recorded in the Department of Overseas Trade, I am to request that you will be so good as to forward such infor mation regarding his nationality, business activities, commercial and financial reputation, as will enable the Erebus Manufacturing Company, Limited, to decide whether he is likely to prove a suitable representative for the sale of their products. Enclosure to Serial No. (21). Letter from the Erebus Manufacturing Company, Limited, London, to the Department of Overseas Trade, No. J/J/LM, dated the 18th February 1935. Some time ago, you were good enough to give us the name of Mr. J. D. Brown, of Camp, Aden. Mr. Brown acted satisfactorily for us for a time, and then he returned to Eng land, but before his departure, fixed up with Mr. C. Ireland to take over our Agency. Mr. Ireland has now relinquished our Agency, as he says it does not run in with his other lines. We have received a letter from Mr. M. Perera, Crescent Hotel, Aden, asking for our Agency. We shall be glad to have any information you can give us con cerning the suitability of this man to represent us, which information we shall of course treat as confidential.

Letter from the Town Clerk, Guildhall, Hull, to the Colonial Office, No. JB/WHH/PAI, dated the 1st March 1935. Deportation of Coloured Seamen. I have been instructed to take the necessary steps to obtain the certificate of the Stipendiary Magistrate under the Aliens Order, 1920, with respect to certain Arab seamen who have been in receipt of relief, with a view to the men being deported. Some of the Arabs claim that they were born in Aden, and, hence, although they are registered as Aliens, some question may arise in the course of the proceed ings as to whether they are not British Subjects. I am aware, of course, that the onus is entirely upon the alleged Aliens to show that they are British Subjects, but for the purpose of the proceedings I am desirous of having an authoritative statement as to the status of the various parts of the Aden territory. The position, so far as I can gather, would seem to be that the town of Aden itself, together with Perim, form for legal purposes part of British India and are part of the British Dominions, while there is a considerable territory in addition which is merely a British Protectorate. If this is correct a person born either in the town of Aden or Perim is a British Subject, while one born in the Protectorate is an Alien. I shall be glad to be furnished with a statement from the Colonial Office as to the status of the various parts of the territory, and also as to the dates on which the present status became operative as, of course, the aliens with whom I am con cerned will have been born some considerable time ago. Enclosure to Serial No. (22). Letter from the Colonial Office, to the Town Clerk, Guildhall, Hull, No. 78020/35, dated the 13th March 1935. I am directed by Secretary Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister to acknowledge Hie receipt of your letter (JB/WHH/PAI) of the 1st of March regarding the deportation of coloured seamen, and to convey to you the following information in reply to your enquiry as to the status of various parts of Aden.fe; &gt; 22 2 . The peninsula of Aden proper, extending to Khormaksar, was vested in the Crown, as part of India, by the Government of India Act of 1858. In 1868 the island of Sira and the peninsula of Jabal Ihsan, or Little Aden, were acquired by purchase and in 1882 the flat strip of coast was also purchased. All the above territory forms the Aden Settlement and is part of British India. 3. Perim was occupied in 1799, was subsequently abandoned, but was icoccupied in 1857. It is attached to the Aden Settlement for administrative pur poses. The remainder of the territory is a British Protectorate.

Letter from His Majesty’s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office. No. 4-Conf., dated the 7th January 1935. I have the honour to refer to my confidential despatch No. 204 of the 2nd July last [Serial No. (78) in File No. 17-N/34] relative to the activities of Mr. K. S. Twitchell, xepresentalive of the Saudi Arabia Mining Syndicate (Limited), and to Jedda report for December 1934 (on File No. 72-N/34) para graph 304 and preceding reports, where the varying fortunes of Mr. Twitchell engaged over a period of some six months in negotiating with the Saudi Arab Government a concession to exploit minerals in this country, have been periodi- eall\ recorded. The successful conclusion of these negotiations w r as noticed in the report under reference and was announced in the Mecca Umm-al-Qura of the 28th December in a shoit article which described the concession, signed on the 23rd December 1934, as one for the exploitation of the gold and other mineral resources of the count! y, with the exception of oil and other liquids, over a res tricted area. The agieem.en.t, the article stated, would shortly be ratified and thereafter the text would be published. 2 . Pending the publication of the text of the concession, the following parti culars, pait’y disclosed in conversation by Mr. Twitchell himself, and partly receiv ed from other sources, are of interest : (a) The Government are to be assigned 15 per cent, of the shares in any companies to be formed to w ork particular concessions a provision which it is gathered, proved unplat able to Mr. Twitchell, who favoured the assignment of 15 per cent, of the initial nominal capital rather than 15 per cent, of shares actually issued, as and when issued, a point on which he found him self obliged to yield. Mr. Twitchell stated that he successfully resisted the desire of the Saudi Government to participate, to the extent of 15 per cent, of the shares23 m the existing syndicate, a holding for which the Government were even prepared to pay. (b) The Government is to receive 5 per cent, of any gold eventually extrac ted. (c) Customs duty is to be paid at a flat rate of 10 per cent, on all material, etc., impoited. (d) The area finally agreed on under the concession is, roughlv, the whole of the Hejaz and Asir as far south as Birk, with the exception of certain re served areas, notably about the Holy Cities. This general description was gi ven by Mr. Philby, who said that the area first approved by the King extended as far as meridian 44 degrees, thus including a considerable slice of Nejd, but that it was later decided to set the eastern limits much more to the west. Mr. Twitched, who did not allude in any detail to this point, expressed himself generally as quite satis fied with the area actually allotted, (e) The agreement, according to Mr. Twitched, must be ratified by the syndicate, after which it will be published. 3. It is gathered that Mr. Twitched is to be joined by M. Van de Pod, the D itch Moslem who has for some years resided in this country, where formerly he had commercial interests in work connected with the concession, although presum ably in some non-technical capacity. Mr. Twitched left Jedda for Egypt and Syria on the 26th December and is understood to be actively engaged m making arrangements for prospecting, and, if a report from Messrs. Gedatly, Hankey k Co that a large consignment of pit-props has been ordered tnrough them by Mr. I witched is to be believed, for early mining operations as wed. ^ ^ am sending a c opy of this despath to the Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Department of Overseas Trade.

M.’s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 89 (76316112), dated the 24th March 1935. As yon are aware Ibn Saud makes it his'annual pracdce to give a great banquet in Mecca for notable pilgrims of all nations just before the Pilgrimage. 1 find that I sent no separate report on this event last year but I included some account of it in my despatch No. 88 of March 31st, 1934, on the Saudi Yemen situation. This year the occasion merits separate treatment. 2. This year’s pilgrimage has brought to the Hejaz an unusually large number of Moslems of high standing and a good many politicians of less note but of some importance in their own countries. The former have included crr-King Amanullah of Afghanistan ; His Highness the Nawab of Bahawalpur ; the chief Begum of His Exalted Highness the Nizam of Hyderabad, with Sir Nizamat Jung in attendance ; another Begum of the Hyderabad family ; the Glawi from Morocco ; Abdullah Ibn Wazir, the Governor of Hudayda, who was here last year as Yemeni delegate at the peace negotiations ; Nawab Sir Umar Hayat Khan, honorary A.-D.-C. to His Majesty the King ; and a brother of the Sheykh of Dibai. 3. Most of the male personages just mentioned were among the five hundred guests or so, whom the King entertained on the evening of March 12th. As the King had arrived only on March 10th, the arrangements were made hurriedly. Among the absentees were the Nawab of Bahawalpur, who pleaded illness, and Sir Umar Hayat Khan, the reasons! for whose non-appearance I do not know. The Nawab may have been worried about questions of precedence but members of his suite attended the dinner. The King had e^King Amanullah on his right, with Sayyid Hasan A1 Idrisi and, I believe, the Glawi beyond. The second place of honour on his left was given very significantly to Abdullah A1 Wazir. 4. The King's principal speech was reproduced, as usual, in the Umm-al- Qura, probably^ m an edited version. The published version is not worth sub mitting to you in fall but. a few points may be noted. He began with his customary exhortations and insistence on the importance of close adherence to Moslem tenets, especially the doctrine of the Unity. He and his were Beduins, possessing nought except the blessing of God and desiring the co-operation of Arabs and Moslems. The King then spoke of the events of last year and refer red specially to the past enmity between himself and the Idrisi and A1 Wazir, who w’ere now sitting at his table. The w r ar had shown, he said, the dis advantages of discord to both sides. Moslems generally had welcomed the peaceful ending and he invited them all to work together. The most interesting passage in his speech was that in which he scouted the idea that foreign influences had caused the quarrel. Moslems and Arabs were themselves responsible for their differences. In their press utterances they raged rudely against each LS156F.D ~ .other but were polite to occidentals. If they respected themselves, co-operated and followed the right path they would succeed. 5. -E^-King Amanullah delivered a speech which was also reported in the L r mm-al-(*&gt;ura but in a very anodyne form. The published version contains no mention of his two principal points in trying to make which he dropped two bricks. He urged the desirability of general Moslem conferences at pilgrimage time and boggled when his remarks were coldly received. You will remember that I bn Saud convened such a conference in 1926 and has never repeated the embarrassing experiment. Amanullah Khan’s other point was that traffic in slaves was all wrong and should be abolished in Saudi Arabia. The moment was clearly ill-chosen for the expression of this sentiment, so admirable in itself, and means were found to silence the orator. 6 . There were J understand numerous other speeches including one by a speaker whom I have not identified, who applauded the present regime in Afghanistan. The only orators named in the official report, besides the King and Amanullah Khan were Muhammad A1 Ghuneymi A1 Taftazani and a certain Muhammad Sadiq al Mujahid. The latter I take to be the adversary of Ibn Saud on whom His Majesty’s Government have long had their eye but who recently returned to this country under the terms of the recent so-called amnesty. Al Taftazani belongs to a family of some religious consequence in Egvpt, who claim descent from the Prophet. His importance lies in the fact that in the past he has been a violent critic of Ibn Saud, especially, if I remember rightly, but I have not verified this, at the time of the Idrisi revolt in Asir in 1932. He is understood to have praised the King highly in his speech at the dinner. The sincerity of these conversions may be doubted, but the lip-service of such former enemies shows how greatly the events of last year have enhanced Ibn Sand’s credit in outer Moslem and Arab circles. 7. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Government of India, Aden and Cairo. I have the honour to be with the highest respect. (28) MEMORANDUM.

With reference to my despatch No. 4 of the 7th January [Serial No. [24)1, 1 have the honour to state that the text of the agreement between the Saudi Gov ernment and the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate (Limited) was published in the Umm-al-Qura of the 15th February, together with a Royal decree dated the 12th February sanctioning the agreement. It may be assumed that the syndicate had already ratified it. 2. The agreement is a fairly lengthy document, and I consider it unnecessary to trouble you with all the details. I enclose a synopsis showing the principal conditions. In the absence of the annexed map it is difficult to trace the exact boundaries of the assigned area on the south and east, but a very fair idea of them can be formed with the aid of the ordinary maps and the Handbook for Arabia, You will observe that the northern boundary is the de facto frontier between the Hejaz and Transjordan, starting from “ Point E ”, the position of which is defined as in the Hadda Agreement. 3. Mr. Twitchell duly visited Egypt and Syria as foreshadowed in my despatch under reference and travelled as far east as Rutba, whence he went to see the alleged gold mine at Gaara. He then proceeded for a short time to England. lie returned to Jedda on the 17th February and is now making active preparations to start his prospecting campaign at four places, all of which are in the northern part of the assigned area and the most important of which is the “ Got of Gold ”, where he has previously done some preliminary work. He has collected two mining engineers, a British subject named George, who has had much experience in India, and a United States citizen named Ballard, besides a cl rical assistant named Bisshopp. He expects a third mining engineer from Australia. M. van de Poll, who was mentioned in my despatch under reference, has already been busy up Medina way and Mr. Twitchell describes him as having done magnificent work. I gather that the general headquarters of the prospectors will be in the first instance at Yanbu’, where a house has already been rented. Mr. Twitchell is certainly tackling his enterprise with great energy. 4.

As regards paragraph 2 of the despatch under reference, I enclose, for your information, a copy of this office despatch No. C.-641 of the 18th July 1934 to the Director, Department of Immigration, Palestine. It will be seen that the restriction imposed is aimed at preventing an influx of indigent Yemeni Jews into the Adgn Settlement as they constitute a possible menace to public health owing to overcrowding. 3. Before the restriction was imposed I consulted Mr. Selim Menahem Messa, Head of the Jewish Community in Aden, who was in favour of restriction. 4. No restrictions have been imposed on the entry into Aden of Jews of sufficient means, and careful arrangements have been made to ensure that no legitimate traders are hindered in any way. The system whereby the Yemeni Jewish population in Aden is kept in the neighbourhood of 500 is, at present, working sal isfaeiori iy. Enclosure 1 to Serial No. (33).

I have the honour to state that Yemeni Jews numbering about 890 have arrived in Aden, and fi+0 during the past few months are still awaiting emigra tion to Palestine. Mo si of these families are indigent. As the limited accom modation at our disposal has been overcrowded to the danger of the general health of the public, I am unable to permit: further immigration into the Aden LS156FD n ' B29 Settlement. Therefore from loth August 1934 until such time as the present number of Yemeni Jews has been reduced to 300 at Sheikh Othman and Crater all indigent Yemeni Jews will be prevented from entering the settlement. 2 I shall therefore be glad if you will kindly inform the leading Yemen Jews and the Zionist Executive Agency in Palestine of the restriction to be imposed by this Administration so that they may be enabled to use their influence to restrict further immigration until the present numbers are absorbed bv the Immigration Certificates and embarked for Palestine.

Champion, Political Secretary, Aden to Mr. Max Nurock, Chief Secretary's Office, Palestine, No. 0.1189 dated the 23rd of March 1932. AVith reference to your demi-official letter No. I.|552|31 of the 31st January 1932 regarding the national status of Jews in the Yemen, 1 have made a number of independent enquiries from my Agents in that country, and from Jews of A emem stock in Aden, one of whom is a well-known and prosperous merchant of San’a. The following information will serve, not only to answer your specific ques- • lion, but to give you an impression of the social position of the Imam’s Jewish subjects :— (a) .There is no formal Nationality Law in the Yemen, the national status of the inhabitants of which is regulated by custom or by the Imam’s decree. (/&gt;) Jews born or having their permanent resident in the Imam’s terri tories, and not having other nationality, are considered to be his subjects. I presume that foreign nationals residing in the Yemen and their children born in the Yemen do not lose their foreign nationality save by their own act, in the absence of specific Yemeni law in that respect. This question has, as far as I know, never been tested. (c) The Imam appears to be reluctant to allow his Jewish subjects to emigrate. If the prospective emigrant is poor and owns no pro perty he is obliged to provide a surety against his return ; if he owns property he must transfer it to administration by the Imam and can recover it on his return to the country. There is a special department in San’a for the administration of such trust estates. (d) The Jewish subjects of the Imam between the ages of 13 and 60, and male, pay a poll tax annually. The tax is assessed in three grades, of M. T. dollars 4, 2 or 1, in accordance with the financial status of the tax-payer. No other direct tax is levied on Jews. Customs duties are levied irrespective of race or creed. (e) There is a Rabbinical Court in San’a with jurisdiction in disputes between Jews, but such cases may also be heard bv a Moslem Qadhi specially appointed for the purpose. “ Mixed ” cases go to the Shar’ia Court, where however (I am informed) Jewish evidence against a Moslem is not accepted. (/) Jews in the Yemen are permitted to manufacture and consume “ arak ” and wine in Jewish quarters, but are prohibited from selling or distributing such liquor to Moslems. (In this connection cf. Aden Political Intelligence Summary, paragraph 1858.) (g) Jewish children, having no parents or other relations and no means of support, are collected and absorbed into the Moslem Orphanage in San’a where they grow up as Moslems without distinction from their fellow orphans. I do not know the method of their conversion nor at what stage it is effected. And although there was at one time a good deal of talk about it in Jewish circles here, I do not think that _ the system, objectionable as it must be to Jewish susceptibilities, has been accompanied by undue compulsion or deliberate disregard of evidence. (h) Jews in the Yemen are subject to certain traditional disabilities relat ing to the wearing of silken garments (except on holidays in their own quarters) ; the riding of horses, or of mules and asses except pn journeys, and then only sideways ; and to behaviour when pass ing or accompanying Moslems. I am under the general impression that the life of Jews in the Yemen, while it is subject to many disabilities and prohibitions, which, however repugnant to the more enlightened of them and to western ideas, have long been established by tradition and custom, is not unhappy and need not be unprosperous. The present Imam is tolerant to them and lends a ready ear to their complaints. The Crown Prince ” Seif A1 Islam Ahmed, may be less so when he succeeds, but they have friends among the other Princes. Most of the foregoing is irrelevant to your question, and much of it may be old news, but I send it to you for what it is worth.Enclosure 5 to Serial No. (33).

With reference to Sir A. Ryan’s despatch No. 75 of March 11th, 1935, relative to Saudi-Egyptian relations, I have the honour to report that the’Saudi Arab Agent in Cairo (Sheikh Fawzan El Sabek) has recently been included hi the list of persons receiving customs franchise in Egypt'and authorised to obtain supplies of duty free petrol. These concessions, which have been the subject of official correspondence between the Saudi-Arab Agency and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, explain the article in the “ Saut-al-Hejaz ” news paper quoted by Sir A. Ryan, but they do not, of course, connote the full recogih- tion suggested by the Egyptian journalist. 2 . 1 am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s Minister, Jeddah. (35) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter, dated 3rd May 1935. {Received on 25th May 1935, with Political Secretary^ letter No. 19, dated 10th May 1935.) Letter from H. M.’s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 80, dated the 18th March 1935. With reference to my despatch No. 56 of the 24fh February [Serial No. (31) ], relative to the concession recently granted bv the Saudi Government to the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate (Limited), I have the honour to state that the Royal decree sanctioning the concession referred to an agreement and contract'as lia\ ing been signed by the Minister of Finance and the representative of the syndicate. It now appears that these were two separate instruments as, after the agreement summarised in the enclosure to my despatch under reference had been published, the Umm-al-Qura proceeded to publish, in instalments, an even lengthier document described as a contract concluded on the same date as the main agreement. 2 . Although the further document is described as above, it is clear from internal o\ idence that it is a form of mining lease for fiftv-eight years, in respect ot areas to be finally selected for definite mining operations in accordance with article 3 of the main agreement. The procedure contemplated would appear to be that the Government will lease these areas t'o the syndicate on the conditions laid down in the “ contract ”, and that the syndicate will form subsidiary com panies to work the individual properties. As the general conditions are stated in the main agreement, I do not think it necessary to report at length on the “contract ”, the detailed stipulations of which appear to follow normal lines. The following points, however, may be noted {a) The Government are to receive during the period of the lease a rent of £1 per feddan of the leased area plus the excess, if anv, of 5 per cent, of the product of the mine over the rental so fixed. (b) The special arrangement for payment of customs duty on imported supplies, etc., at a flat ratQ of 10 per cent, will operate throughout the period of the lease.32 (c) The Government are not only to receive gratis 15 per cent, of the share capital of the eventual subsidiary companies, fully paid up, but they are to have the right to nominate a director to serve on the board of each company, the total membership of which shall not exceed six persons. 3.

Sil J ce r! lin £ my des P atch ^0. 861|282|9 of April 4th, to the High Commis sioner tor Palestine, a copy of which was enclosed in my printed despatch No. 106 ol the same date to the Foreign Office, I have received from the Deputy Inspector General of the C. I. D., Jerusalem, an English version of a long memo randum in Arabic regarding the alleged machinations of the Jews in Palestine, with a request for information as to its circulation here and its probable effect in Moslem circles. In my reply to the Deputy Inspector General, sent under flying seal via the High Commissioner, I drew his attention to the despatch referred to above and said that the Arabic pamphlet circulated in Mecca appeared to lie a shorter version of that which had come to his notice in Palestine. -Afftm I had written to the Deputy Inspector General I had brought to my notice a large collection of other pamphlets in Arabic, which would appear to have been circulated in Mecca this year. I am unable to forward the texts of these but the following list of titles may be of interest : (1) The Statutes, etc., of the Moslem Congress, published in Jerusalem 19 pages, no date. (2) The decisions of the Congress held in 1931, published in Jerusalem 2/ pages, no date. (3) Proclamation to all our Moslem brethren, published in Jerusalem 1347 (1928), 11 pages. (4) Account by the Association for the protection of “ Al-Masjed Al- Aqsa ” and the Moslem holy places in Jerusalem, published in Jerusalem, 10 pages and 6 illustrations, no date. (5) Regulation of the Arab Exhibition Company, Limited, established in 1934, published in Jerusalem, 18 pages, no date. ^ (6) Principal instructions for the second Arab Exhibition of Jerusalem, published in Jerusalem, 10 pages and a specimen form dated 4lh March 1934.

(9) The Black-Red Atrocities or Civilization by fire and sword, published in Damascus in 1931, 115 pages. 3. Although several of these publications are not new, it is significant that all or most of them appear to have been brought to the Hejaz this year for distribution to pilgrims. In this connexion I would refer to the account given in my despatch No. 114 of April 13th, of my conversation with Fuad Bey Hamza on the exploitation of the pilgrimage for purposes of political propaganda and of r uad Bey’s reaction to my remarks. 4. Further efforts have been made to obtain a copy of the alleged Urdu version of the anti-Jewish pamphlet, which I mentioned in my conversation with cA* 33 Fuad Bey. They have been unsuccessful and I am inclined to accept Fuad Bey’s statement that, if anything was produced in Urdu, it was not printed. 5. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Excellency the Viceroy of India, Foreign and Political Department and to His Excellency the High Com missioner for Palestine at Jerusalem.

In continuation of the letter from this Department (No. 37976/34), of the 9th January [Enclosure 2 to S.

The Resident has ascertained that the King of the Yemen has im posed restrictions on the emigration of Jews from the Yemen to Palestine through Aden and by any other route. 3. The Resident states that the Yemeni Government had previously discouraged emigration to Palestine by the confiscation of property in the Yemen belonging to the emigrants, but no penalties were inflicted on their relatives who remained in the Yemen. When it was realised that the majority of the Yemeni Jews who left for Aden were bound for Palestine the Yemeni authorities decided to prevent the emigration of Jews to any foreign place, and new restrictions were made some months ago to effect this purpose. 4 . If a Jew now wishes to leave the Yemen to do business in Aden or elsewhere he is required to produce a surety for his return witout which he is not allowed to proceed. Certain restrictions have also been imposed on the movements of Jews from place to place in the interior of the Yemen.

P.S .—I also enclose a copy of the reply which we have just received from Jedda to our telegraphic enquiry. Enclosure 1 to S. No. (52). (Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter, dated &amp;th August 1935.) Minute.\ Lord Castlestewart called this morning. Mr. Ward was also present at the interview. After giving me the necessary particulars regarding his Syndicate’s concession, Lord Castlestewart began by explaining that the Saudi Govern ment had asked the Syndicate for a loan of one million silver rivals to be minted by the Syndicate. His views on this point and the enquiries he made in connexion with it are recorded in the attached draft telegram, which I agreed to send, at the Syndicate’s expense. Lord Castlestewart then discussed the general position. The gist of his enquiries was very much as we had expected, his main point being an enquiry whether His Majesty’s Government might not think it worth their while to give some kind of financial assistance to Saudi Arabia, with a view to maintaining the present regime in power, since, if they did not do so, other countries such as Italy might well take the opportunity of getting a finger in the pic and might then, if Ibn Saud’s regime should eventually collapse, find an excuse for political intervention in Arabia, more parti- cularlv as the mining concessions wdiich his Syndicate had obtained were certainly of very considerable value. Lord Castlestewart also wished to know whether there might not be some possibility of securing the appoint ment of a British Financial Adviser, or of getting some arrangement with Saudi Arabia by which the Saudi customs receipts should be assigned as security for a loan. He asked for any general information we could give him. I told Lord Castlestewart that we were on excellent terms with Saudi Arabia and had, generally speaking, a high opinion of King Ibn Sand, who had done a great deal for his country and was much more direct in his methods and satisfactory to deal with than the great majority of rulers in the East. At the same time, the country was organised on an extremely primitive basis and was exceedingly poor. It had no real budget and lived very much from hand to mouth, chiefly on the pilgrimage and on grazing taxes the collection of which was farmed out to local governors. I would not hazard any prophecy as to what might happen on the death of King Ibn Saud, particularly as he had comparatively few reliable officials. But Saudi Arabia was in definite treaty relations with a large number of coun tries and with all her neighbours, a’nd I doubted whether there was any real danger of any European Power attempting adventures there in the circum stances. Like other countries in the Middle East, Saudi Arabia was intensely nationalist and jealous of her independence, and it was most im probable that Ibn Saud would consent in any circumstances whatever to assign any revenues as security for a foreign loan. The assignment of39 revenues for foreign loans was generally regarded in the Middle East as a prelude to foreign intervention and a derogation from national independ ence. This applied also to some extent to the suggestion for a Financial Adviser. It was most unlikely that Ibn Saud would accept a foreign Financial Adviser with any real powers. As to the attitude of His Majesty’s Government, it was their policy to keep on good terms with Saudi Arabia and to do what they could to help Ibn Saud when occasion arose. But I could say quite definitely that the Treasury would never look at any thing like financial assistance. If there was to be any question of financial assistance, it must therefore, be on a purely commercial basis and it was for the private interests concerned to decide whether it was worth their while to run the obviously serious financial risks involved. Nor would it help Ibn Saud to maintain his position if he had to rely on our, or on any other foreign assistance. We had some further conversation on the above lines, and I think Lord Castlestewart realised that we could not commit ourselves in any way or give him any kind of lead. Indeed, I doubt whether he really expected us to do so. Meanwhile, I promised to send off the attached telegram and told Lord Castelstewart that the department would let him hear further (as I hoped myself to be away on leave), as soon as we received Mr. Calvert’s reply.

Ryan’s despatch No. 80 of March 18th : Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate’s concession [S. No. (35)]. Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate state that they have been asked by Saudi Government for loan of one million silver riyals, to be minted by the Syndicate, owing to alleged shortage of silver coinage in Saudi Arabia. Syndicate have no intention of complying with this request, but are contem plating possibility of minting £2,000 worth of silver riyals a month, to be used in paying their employees and meeting their other expenses in Arabia. 2. They have been informed by Mr. Twitchell that, owing to shortage of silver rival exchange has recently risen from 12 to 10 riyals to the pound and may rise further. This presumably refers to pounds sterling and not to pounds gold (cf., Eastern Department’s letter of April 4th to Chancery ** about currency of Saudi claim for assistance in searching for lost aircraft). They are anxious to obtain confirmation of Twitchell’s statement. 3. Please telegraph any information regarding riyal exchange, and any observations on above proposals. Enclosure 3 to S. No. (52).

Your telegram No. 93. That there is a shortage of Silver Coinage would appear likely to sug gest reason for importation mentioned in Jedda report for May, paragraph 27i;c) f&amp;pd&gt; 40 r 145 F. No. (92-N/34). There are believed to have been further importa- tions of Silver rupees since. Twitchell’s associate of Van Der Poll also recently mentioned he had experienced difficulty in obtaining sufficient silver riyals here for Company’s purposes. I had a conversation with Twitchell the night before he left, reported by despatch No. 227, August 6-th, which left by bag yesterday, but he made no reference to the proposal of Saudi Government. He saw Minister of Finance on July 22nd. 2 . Rates show keen appreciation of the riyal; mde Jedda report for June (F. No. 92-N./35), paragraph 192. In terms of Egyptian pounds rate rose after the pilgrimage (when normally it should fall, below the usual figure of 14 to 15) to 11 riyals, then for one day, July 30th(?) to 8^ riyals falling to 10 riyals and 8 piastres, subsequently steadied to 10 riyals. one piastre at the end of July where it still remains. 3. Reasons for shortage are obscure. No reports have been received of export of silver coinage and stories of hoarding (by Banque of Misr inter, alia) for sale at a profit during next pilgrimage are difficult to accept. Rates are likely to rise as usual when pilgrimage season commences in Jedda and do not for other reasons before then.

Letter from His Majesty’s Charge d’affaires, Jedda, to His Excel lency the Hugh Commissioner for Palestine, No. 861/282/9 dated the 4th April 1935. With reference to my despatch No. 819/282/5 of March 29th last, re- garding the remarks about Palestine, which Ibn Saud made during an interview granted to journalists after the recent attempt on his life, I have the honour to inform Your Excellency that my attention has been drawn to the fact that a pamphlet, produced by the Association for the protection of “A1 Masjid-ul-Aqsa” and the Holy Places in Jerusalem and dated the 15th Dhu’l Qa’da, 1353 (February 19th), has been distributed in Mecca during the pilgrimage. I presume that this pamphlet has already been brought to Your Excellency’s notice but it may be useful to indicate the general nature of its contents, if only for purposes of identification. 2. The pamphlet begins, after the usual invocation, with a glorifica tion of the Mosque of Omar and declares that the Arabs of Palestine, who have been appointed by God as guardians of this shrine, feel it their duty to appeal to the Moslems of the whole world and warn them of the danger to the sanctuary and the country from the Jews. The latter, having been promised a national home in Palestine, have openly proclaimed their inten tion of seizing the Mosque of Omar, which they allege is “the Jewish temple’ ’. 3. Then follow various pronouncements by the Jewish leaders and instances of propaganda by newspaper and by picture. The growing menace to the Arabs of the acquisition of land by Jews, the increase of the Jewish population and the steady flow of immigrants from all parts of the world is emphasised. 4. The Moslem counter-eflorts are related, including a large meeting in the Mosque of Omar which resulted in the issue of a “Fatwa” forbidding the sale of land to Jews and enjoining the boycott of all who participate in such sales. This “Fatwa” was confirmed by Ulama in Egypt, Iraq, India, Morocco and other countries. 5. The pamphlet ends with an appeal foi general Moslem co-operation to avert the danger. The Jews all over the world are working for the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine and the Arabs of Palestine are not able to fight them unaided. If all Moslems unite to preserve the mosque and the holy land their object will, with the help of God, be achieved. 6. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. i i • (54) 1 {Received on IJ^th September 1935 with Political Secretary’s letter No. 35, dated 29th August 1635.) (Enclosure in Foreign Office, covering note, dated 12th August 1935.) Letter from the Foreign Office, to Lord Castlestewart, No. P. Z.- 5596/35, dated the 13th August 1935. In Mr. RendeFs absence on leave, I write to inform you that we have now had a reply from our Charge d’Affaires, at Jedda to the telegram which we sent at your request to enquire the present position about the exchange rate of silver riyals.42 2. Mr. Calvert thinks that there must be in fact a shortage of silver coinage and he quotes as evidence of this the importation by the Saudi Government of 400,000 Indian rupees last May, and further importations of silver rupees which have apparently taken place since then. 3. Mr. Calvert reports that there has been keen appreciation of the silver rival recently. As you know, the Saudi Government attempted at one time to maintain an artificial rate of 10 rivals to one gold pound, but the rate steadily depreciated, until at the end of 1933 it was over 24 rivals to the gold pound. The following figures show, however, the appreciation which has taken place this year in the selling rates of exchange for rivals to the gold pound :— Ist April—Riyals 21. 1st May—Riyals 20J. 1st June—Riyals 20. 30th June—Riyals 17, 18. 4. In terms of Egyptian pounds the riyal rate apparently rose after the Pilgrimage to 11, and then for one day to falling subsequently to 40 riyals, 8 piastres, and then steadying to 10 riyals, 1 piastre at the end of July where it still remains. This is the more remarkable as the rate normaily falls after the Pilgrimage below the usual figure of 14-15 riyals to the Eygptian pound. 5. When attention was first drawn to the steady appreciation in the vaule of riyals, observers were uncertain as to the exact cause behind it, but it now looks as though the main influence might in fact be a shortage of silver coinage. Mr. Calvert reports, however, that the reasons for this shortage are obscure. He has not heard any stories of the export of silver coinage and he finds it difficult to believe rumours of hoarding of coinage for sale at a profit during the next pilgrimage. The rates for Saudi cur rency normally rise when the pilgrimage season begins, but do not generally do so for other reasons before then. 6. As Mr. Ren del mentioned in the course of your interview with him on 7th August, we are obliged by our standing instructions to ask you to be so good as to refund the cost of the telegram despatched at your request to Jedda, and of the reply thereto, and our Finance Department will in due course send you the customary official request for repayment.

(Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter, dated 10th October 1935.) Letter from His Majesty’s Charge d’Affa,tres, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 227, dated the 6th August 1935. With reference to Sir Andrew Ryan’s despatch No. 80, of the 18th March [S. No. (35)], concerning the concession granted by the Saudi Arab Government to the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate (Limited), I have the honour to submit a general report on the activities in the Hejaz of the syndicate since the ratification of the concession by King Abdul Aziz on the 12th February last. 2. It will be recollected that the concession allowed the syndicate three months in which to get to work, a yeai for general prospecting and another year for further research in selected areas, after which leases were to be granted to subsidiary companies foimed to work the individual property. Mr. Twitchell seems’at present to be well ahead of this schedule. He set to work, with great energy, immediately after his return to Jedda on the 17th February. The Australian, a Mr. Shanks, mentioned by Sir Andrew Ryan in his despatch No. 56 of the 24th February [S. No. (31)] arrived with a British clerical assistant on the 27th February, and the whole party set out early in March for Yanbu and the Northern Hejaz. 3 After four months prospecting and assay work Mr. Twitchell seems to have decided to concentrate, for the moment, his attentions on the gold workings at Mahd-adh-Dhahab (“Cot of Gold”), and has withdrawn Mr. Shanks from Yanbu- an-Nakhl where he has been working without success ful results. 4 Mahd-adh-Dahab was visited for three weeks in June by Mr. E. D, McDermott, one of the directors of the syndicate On his return to Eng land earlv in July, followed on the 24th July by Mr. Twitchell, who hoped to tiavel from Egypt by air, it was reliably reported that a subsidiary company had been formed to work the area containing this mine.44 5. The Mahd-adh-Dhahab gold mine, which is situated at 24° 15' N., and 41° 10' E. at a height of 3,550 feet above sea level, is said to have been worked by Hanm-ar-Rashid and perhaps even earlier in the times of the Jahilfya. The extensive workings and the large area covered by ruined build ings show that a great number of workmen were employed in those times. Mr. Twitchell is now seeking to prove that the workings were not exhausted of their gold, but were abandoned either through the lack of engineering equipment and the knowledge how to mine deeper, or through the failure of the water-supply or from political reasons. 6. Mr. Twitcheli has been working at this mine himself and says he is very gratified with the results so far obtained in the mining of gold. There are, I believe, also subsidiary metals. He foreshadowed early developments and hoped to start diamond drilling, the machinery for which was on its way. Mr. Twitchell is, however, faced with many pro blems. I am not competent to judge the scheme from a technical mining point of view, but engineering problems may well be small compared with other factors such as the supply of water and communications with Medina and the coast. 7. Mr. Twitchell confessed to me in conversation that the water supply was indeed a problem and said it might be necessary to sink a well. At present water is found in the surrounding districts at Maden (3 kilom.), Jiraisiya (10 kilom.), and Suwaijiya (50 kilom.), while at the mine itself Mr. Twitchell has discovered a shaft containing water, estimated at about 7,000 gallons, which he intends to reserve for use in connexion with the diamond drilling. 8. With his usual energy and with Mr. van de Poll’s local knowledge in support, Mr. Twitcheil has set to work to solve the problem of communi cations. Mahd-adh-Dhahab lies, as the crow flies, some 100 miles from Medina and 240 from Jedda. The original plan was to use Yanbu as a base, being only 200 miles from the mine, but during these four months the road has been found very difficult. Non-Moslems have to leave the beaten track from Yanbu to Medina and circle the forbidden area to the north, making the road distance about 315 miles, and mostly over abomi nable ground of Harat lava, where in the winter the trucks were once or twice held up by rain floods. This combined with the abandonment of the workings at Yanbu-an-Nakhl have induced the syndicate to consider the possibility of a road from Jedda, which will be a little longer than the Yanbu road, and which would give the advantages of quicker external communication through the larger port. They are accordingly now occu pied in prospecting three alternate routes:— (1) Jedda-Asfan-A1 Birka-Mahd-adh-Dhahab. (2) Jedda-Rabigh-Madh-adh-Dhahab. (3) A route between these two. None of these routes is at all practical at the moment; to quote Mr. van de Poll, who made a preliminary prospecting journey through to the mine on the Rabigh route, he only went forward because he knew he could not go back. It remains to be seen which, if any, of these three routes are chosen. 9. Well sinking, road making and the provision of food and medical treatment in the middle of unknown desert can only be a costly affair; it argues a wealth of optimism in the promoters in the possibilities of the undertaking. 10.

An Important Declaration by the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Sa'ud Arabian Kingdom. Ibrahim Shanti, the chief editor of “Al Difa’ ”, newspaper had a conversation with His Excellency Fuad Bey Hamzeh, the Sa udi Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs. He discussed with His Excellency the evolution of world events which might lead to the outbreak of war, the attitude and the future of the Arab countries and the political rapproach- ment between Baghdad, Mecca and Sana a. The chief editor of Al Difa’ ” summarised the conversation as follows His Excellency said that the outbreak of war inevitable, and the pre sent political situation shows that it cannot be long delayed. We should not attach much importance to the political alignments in Europe, which appear strong but change easily. France, the refuge of the White Army and the enemy of Russia and Bolshevism, worked hard until Monsieur Barthou who was killed with the King of Yugoslavia, succeeded in having Russia to whom France extended a hand filled with gold, admitted to the League' of Nations. Italy, who was on good terms with Germany and whose relations with France were strained, has completely changed her policy The same is tiue of Poland, once France’s best ally, now Ger many’s firmest friend. Consider also the understanding between Great Britain and Germany which alarmed France, the former’s ally. These alignments change rapidly. Governments take the interests, not the senti ments of their countries into considesation. We ,the Arabs, will in all our plans follow the dictates of our interests not of our feelings.46 The editor enquired : “As you believe that a war will soon take place is it possible for the Arabs to be sure of their Governments’ readiness to take advantage of the opportunity to bring nearer the day of unity?” His Excellency kept silence for a while, then he said : “1 believe so. We are ready and I think Iraq is also. Another proof that the glorious day is drawing near is the rapyroackment which will soon take place between the Governments of Mecca and Baghdad. Successful efforts were made to that end but the situation in Iraq delayed the project. These efforts will be resumed in such a way as to satisfy Arab desires. The pursuance of parallel policies by the Sa’udi and Iraqi kingdoms means, as you will readily understand, the partial attainment of this aim and it will be a good step towards the realisation of national aspirations. The small emirates which you see on the coasts of Arabia will not stand before the hurricane as their existence is contrary to the law of nature. Our rela tions with Sana’a are friendly and intimate.” The editor ended the article thus :— “His Excellency made these statements with a thoughtful man’s quiet smile. We look forward to that glorious day when the Tigris and the / ,r Euphrates will unite with Zamzam and the historic capitals Mecca, paghdad and Sana’a will be joined under one flag, which will lead the Arabs to the long awaited day, the day of unity; such is the demand of all Arabs and the aim of sixty million persons”. &gt; GIPD —271(C) FAPD—S #—26-2B-*£l~-2&amp;A copy of the undermentioned papers^forwarded to the PoIi tical Age nt, B ahrein, ^ ~l6 Po I lpT aal Meng7Xcweit A for information, in le Foiitical Agent, £uscat, continuation of endorsement from the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, Nodated the 3rd December 1935.

The interest evinced in the Hejas by the Banque Misr, particularly in regard to the promotion and development of Egyptian interests in the annual pilgrimage, have been the subject of report by the Legation from time to^ time. The relations established with the Saudi authorities by Talaat Harb Pasha on his visits to this country in the latter end of both 1933 and 1934, have been maintained, and Sheykh Abdullah Suleyman in spending some time recently in Egypt, on his way to Syria and possibly Turkey, recorded in Jedda Reports for August and September, paragraphs 253 and 286 respectively (F.-92-N./33), is with good reason believed to have been animated by a desire to cultivate those relations still further. 2. That the Minister of Finance has been to some extent successful would appear from the arrival at Jedda on the 1st October by one of the small vessels of the Societe Misr de Navigation Maritime, now plying in the Red Sea, of a consignment of fifty-four barrels of Shell asphalt for the purpose of laying down an experimental stretch of road on the main Jedda- Mecca highway. A Greek engineer and an Egyptian, said to represent Talaat Pasha Harb, arrived by the same ship and several days earlier, by a Khedivial Mail vessel, a mixing machine for use in road construction was also landed here on behalf of the Banque Misr. 3 . The two representatives of the Egyptian concern have, since their arrival, lost no time in getting to work, and operations have already com menced outside the Medina Gate of Jedda. It is credibly stated that a kilometre of asphalted road will be laid down at the expense of Banque Misr, except for the labour which is being supplied by the Saudi authorities. I am confidentially informed by the Manager of Messrs, Gellatly, Hankey &amp; Co. (Sudan) Ltd., that it is estimated that the cost of laying down the whole Mecca-Jedda road under asphalt would be in the neighbourhood of £45,000, or £1,000 a mile. Mr. Courtenay, who as the representative of the Shell Company here is much interested in this project, also informed me that Signor Odello, the soi-divant Italian merchant, made an effort to induce the Greek engineer to use Italian asphalt instead of the Shell product, but without success. 4 . I am sending copies of this despatch to the Department of Overseas Trade, the Government of India and Egypt. ( 60 ) Memorandum No. 173 (2698/153/9), dated the 5th November 1935.

I, together with a number of my foreign colleagues, was present at the Quarantine Quay to greet him on landing. There was a fair company of official and other Saudi per sonages present and a guard of honour from the local garrison was mounted. 2. I had a short conversation with Fuad Bey before he left the Quay, in which he referred to the forthcoming visit of Sir Andrew Ryan to Riyadh. He also confessed that he did not yet feel completely restored to health. 3 . I am sending copies of this despatch to the Government of India, Foreign and Political Department, Bushire and Jerusalem.

To Foreign Office, despatch No. 318 of 6th November 1935, regarding^ A piastre project in aid of local schools. Enclo. to S. No. (61). Letter from H. M.’s Charge d’affaires, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 318,. DATED THE 6TH NOVEMBER 1935. I have the honour to inform you that the Mecca newspaper Saut al Heiaz, published on the 29th October a short notice that the leading merchants of Jedda had petitioned the King to sanction a tax of a half piastre miri, about one penny, on every package imported from abroad into the Hejaz, the proceeds to be in aid of the Falah schools of Jedda and Mecca which include, besides a boys school in each town, the girls school of Jedda. The notice announced that the King’s approval had been granted. 2 . The Falah schools were founded in 1904 by Hajji Muhammad Ali Zainal Ali Ridha (Alireza), at his own expense except for about eighty thousand rupees subscribed in India for the construction of the school building in Jedda. Until 1931 Hajji Muhammad Ali continued to defray all expenses. Both religious and secular teaching is given in these schools, English being on the syllabus. In Mecca, the teaching staff consists of thirty four, and in Jedda, at the boys school of twenty-four. Pupils in Mecca number some eight hundred and in Jedda, boys only, about seven hundred. Since 1931 the schools have been supported by subscriptions from several local firms and by other charity. It will be remembered that an effort was made during the visit of Talaat Pasha Harb in 1934 to interest him in the girl’s school, but with little success. 3. Owing to the lack of good management and control and also to insufficient funds, the condition of the schools has become so bad, it is said, that the local merchants made an effort to raise a special fund, whichamounted to four thousand riyals (about four hundred pounds) a quarter of which was subscribed once more by the family of Ali Ridha. This sum being insufficient the merchants petitioned the King as mentioned above. 4. The tax which will be collected by the shipping agencies and handed over to a special committee of merchants, has already been enforced for some weeks in Jedda and orders are expected to be sent soon to Yanbu* and Rabegh. This method of collection, independent of the Government, is so alien to this country that, in my opinion, it may soon undergo a change. 5.

No. (59)], concerning the activities of the Banque Misr in this country, and more especially their interest in road making, I have the honour to report that the kilometre of asphalt road which it was expected the Banque Misr engineers would lay down as a sample, dwindled in fact to a short stretch of some hundred yards. This was very quickly completed and the Greek engineer left again for Egypt some ten days later. Nothing more having been heard of the Egyptian engineer, it is probable that he also has returned home.2 . The hundred yards of road lies outside the Medina gate of Jedda on ground which, owing to its firmness, one might mistrust as a reliable test for a road which, if and when constructed will have to pass on its way to Mecca over hills, wadi beds and shifting sands. No special prepara tion, as far as could be seen, was given to the foundation, the land merely being levelled and the asphalt laid. As for cost, it is now said that the estimate for laying the whole Mecca-Jedda road is less than the £45,000 quoted in my despatch under reference, but the exact figure is not known. 3. Talaat Pasha Harb is reported to intend visiting the Hejaz after Ramadhan which ends with the end of December, so the roadway project may then be re-examined and a decision taken whether or not to proceed with the construction of the Mecca road. 4.

No. (57)], relative to the activities of the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndi cate (Limited), I have the honour to report that Mr. K. S. Twitchell re turned to Jedda on the 6th October,, after his visit to England, during which he paid a flying visit to New York. He was accompanied by two Englishmen, Messrs. T. P. Larken and D. L. Gibbs &gt; and six Swedes, the latter having engaged, as expert diamond drillers. He informed me shortly after his arrival, that he expects two Americans to join him. within the next few days, and hoped that his machinery would not be long in arriving*. 2. Mr. Twitchell and his party have taken up their quarters in a house in the “Legation quarter” of the town, which he leased just before leaving here last July. He intends to make the premises his head office in this country. 3. He stated that he would be leaving for the “Cot oif Gold’ in about two or three weeks, and expressed his satisfaction at the preliminary work already accomplished. One of their chief difficulties, he added, would be the question of water supply, and he anticipated that he might have to go some distance to obtain adequate supplies. 4. During Mr. Twitch ell’s absence, M. Van de Poll, who has been in general charge, and Mr. Shanks, the Australian, with other men^iers of the personnel, have been active. Mr. Shanks, in particular, has been in charge of road-making operations, along the alignment Jedda-Asfan-Ai Birka-Mahd-Adh Dhahab, to which a reference was made in my despatch under reference at paragraph 8, and in regard to which it is believed con siderable progress has been made. 5 . I am sending copies of this despatch to the Department of Overseas Trade and to Transjordan.52 m i ? Memorandum No. 193 (2883/147/29), dated the 30th November 1935. His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Jedda, present^ liis compliments to H. E. the Viceroy of India (F. and P.), and has the honour £o transmit to him the under-mentioned documents. To Foreign Office, despatch No. 344 of 304h November 1935, regard ing Economic situation in JSaudi Arabia. Enclo. to S. No. (69). Letter from H. M.’s Charge d’affaires, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 344 (2881/147/29), dated the 30th November 1935. In my despatch No. 370 (3200/61/34), of the 11th December, 1934 [S. No. (11)], 1 had the honour to submit a brief review of the general financial and economic situation in Saudi Arabia. I now propose, after an interval of almost twelve months, to attempt a similar appreciation, necessarily as brief and perhaps as fragmentary as in previous years, in view of the absence of reliable statistics and the lack of authoritative sources of information. 2. Whilst during the previous twelve months, Saudi finances were heavily engaged in meeting and satisfying the demands of the Saudi- Yemen war and its settlement, the period under review may be held to have witnessed the liquidation of the immediate legacies of the conflict and a renewal of the activities of the Minister of Finance, now less pre-occupied with the duties of his second office of Deputy Minister of Defence, to find fresh sources of revenue to repair the seriously deplenished financial re sources of the state. 3. Some relief was afforded early in the year by a further increase in the nuityber of foreign pilgrims performing the Hajj in 1935. Not only did this figure increase from 25,291 in 1934 to 33,898 but an exceptional number of distinguished personages and well-to-do pilgrims visited the Hejaz this year, a matter of some point when the general level of wealth amongst incoming pilgrims has fallen so markedly in these lean years. The beneficent effects of the increase brought comfort to all classes in the Flejaz, but complaints were not wanting that the Government had appro priated to themselves the lion’s share of the pilgrimage harvest, and dis tress, even amongst merchants, motor-car proprietors and pilgrim-guides, all of whom might have been expected to have benefitted most by a larger pilgrimage, was only partially alleviated. Certain foreign companies in Jedda, however, had a more satisfactory year,, upon completing their accounts after the Hajj, both Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey &amp; Co. (Sudan) Ltd. and Messrs. Sharqieh, Ltd., being able to record some improvement, the latter having achieved a reasonably good profit albeit, according to Mr. Philby, a “paper” one. * 4. Customs receipts form the other main item of Saudi revenue, and during the twelve months under review, these, although no official figures are available, may be expected to have risen in sympathy with the increase in the numbers of pilgrims. Other sources of revenue are of subordinate importance; concessions have not yet commenced to yield steady revenue for operations by the California Arabian Standard Oil Company for the pro duction of oil in Hasa though promising, have not yet been completely suc cessful, and gold-mining operations by the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndi cate upon which I have reported separately, have not yet reached the pro duction stage, though here also there are believed to be grounds for opti mism. As statistics of any description are, in the absence of official figures «yf gome interest I give for what they are worth estimates, given in theEgyptian newspaper “A1 Muqattam” and reproduced in the “Oriente Moderno'’ of May, 1935, of tlie revenues of the Mejaz for “this year' (presumably a period ending after the 1935 pilgrimage); £300,000 gold—from pilgrimage. £200^000 gold—from Customs receipts. £100.000 gold—from other sources. £600,000 Total. 5. General trading conditions may be said to have shown some impro vement during the period under review. Cineliy owing to the larger pil grimage there have been increased clearances through Customs and a some what better tone in the market. This unfortunately does not mean that conditions can be described as satisfactory, but the tendency is encouraging. Protests were again evoked during the year by the practice of the Gov ernment of importing goods, particularly ride, through one importing firm, Messrs. Haji Abdullah Alireza &amp; Co., to the detriment of others, with the result that some small redistribution of favours was effected to soothe the malcontents. The system adopted by the Saudi Arab Govern ment of settling their local indebtedness by allowing rebates of Customs dues on goods imported was maintained through the year, although in its early months the Government appeared disposed to abandon it. Adverse comment, and perhaps a realisation of the convenience of the system to the authorities themselves, led to a continuance of this practice. From one source it is gathered that the total number of packages to enter through the port of Jedda during the past 12 months was 620,000, of which some 120,000 were for the Saudi Arab Government or foreign diplomatic mis sions, and hence duty free. 6. Exports continued to be negligible (they were estimated m March last, for the previous twelve months at about eight thousand pounds gold), but may be expected during recent days to have received a fillip from the reported purchase cf camels from this country by the Italians for purposes connected with the war in Abyssinia, a subject on which separate reports have been submitted. About one thousand camels are said to have been shipped from Yanbu’, though confirmation is still awaited, and the price paid is generally believed to be in the neighbourhood of £15 gold per camel. 7. The visible adverse balance of trade is therefore heavy and has been estimated locally by a confidential but w r ell-informed source as about £1,261,000 gold for the year 1351 A. H. and £981,000 gold for 1352 A. H. 8. Economy has again been rigidly practised, except perhaps in cel^ tain items of Royal expenditure, and once more at the expense of Govern ment officials, whose salaries, when paid, were invariably in arrear, whilst in the early summer steps were taken to effect an all-round salary reduc tion of twenty-five per cent, two thirds of the now reduced salary to be paid in cash and one-third in kind, the cash payment to be reckoned in gold at a rate highly unfavourable to the official. 9. Apart from the system of Customs drafts, described above, the Saudi Government are believed to have been able to meet current liabilities. One signal instance, either of a recognition of the advantages to be derived from a settlement of debts or of a desire to please, may be recorded when in May, 1935, they repaid the whole of one small debt due to His Majesty’s Government and ten per cent, of a larger one due to His Majesty’s Gov ernment and the Government of India. 10. Little or no additional taxation has been imposed during the past twelve months, except in the case of certain minor matters, such as the imposition of an annual tax of £2 gold on wireless receiving sets, permis sion to import and use which, restricted to certain towns of the Hejaz, was one of the notable concessions to Western influences of the year.54 11. The history of the period under review as regards currency has been more eventful than in past, years. A shortage of silver riyals, probably in some measure due to hoarding, made itself felt during the summer, when rates per £ gold showed the following sharp movements:— April 1st 21. f June 1st 20. ► July 1st 1718. I July 11th 1JJ. July 31st 16-8. August 17-0 September 18^-. A further unusual feature was the importation through Jedda from India by Messrs. Haji Abdullah Alireza, for'the account of the Saudi Arab Gov ernment, between May and November inclusive, of Rupees 1,630,000; and a further consignment of Rupees 400,000 is shortly expected. The reason advanced is that the Rupee is a more convenient coin for use in Nejd than the Maria Theresa dollar, and a more popular one with the tribes than the Saudi riyal. 12. Generally, therefore, it may be said that the tendency to improve ment was maintained throughout the year. Prices of foodstuffs have fluc tuated, in the autumn, under the influences of the uncertainty created ,by the Italo-Abyssinian situation, but the Government took certain steps to restore the position and it is claimed, though with doubtful accuracy, that prices have on the whole returned to normal. Distress is still unfortunately all too prevalent, especially in the city of Medina, but has again been mitigated by charity from a variety of foreign sources. 13.

It is with some trepidation that I dare to address you, but would indeed esteem it a personal favour, if you would kindly give the following, your kind consideration. I desire if possible to secure an appointment in the Near East, either in Arabia or Egypt, preferably Arabia. I have numerous friends in Arabia among the nobles of the various tribes, and take rather a keen interest in the welfare of the Arabian Continent. Doubtless you will appreciate the fact, that I prefer to secure an appointment entirely through my own efforts, and would not dream of ap proaching friends for this purpose. If the Foreign Office can assist me in this matter, either officially or otherwise, believe me I should indeed be grateful. Thanking you in advance for your extreme courtesy, and assuring you dear Sir, that an answer whether in the negative or affirmative will indeed be more than appreciated. Please believe my sincerity, when I state that I am actuated by the belief that my services would be of value where Arab tribes are concerned for between these people and myself, there is a bond of friendship.

I am to inform you in reply that in so far as the Foreign Office are concerned no such appointments are at present available. : 2. Without further information as to your qualifications and experi ence it is difficult to give you any advice in the matter, but I am to explain that applications for appointments in Palestine ,Transjordan and the Aden Protectorate should be made through the Colonial Office; for appointments in the Arab States in the Persian Gulf, to the India Office; and for appoint ments in Iraq or Egypt (which are both independent foreign countries) to the Iraqi or Egyptian Legations in London. Vacancies for appointments in any of these countries, are however, rare, and if any were available special qualifications would certainly be required. Appointments for British subjects are seldom or never available in Saudi Arabia. (7) (Received on 12th January 1936, with Political Secretary’s letter No. 52, dated 26th December 1935.)

J During my visit to Riyadh Fuad asked my advice privately and rather casually on technical question if a Power had (grp. undee.) neutrality between two belligerents it could be breach thereof to conclude treaty, e.g., of friendship or an exchange of notes with one of them. I disclaimed expert knowledge of international law but said I thought such a transaction could not constitute breach of neutrality provided it did not provide assist ance to belligerent. Fuad then disclosed obvious object of his enquiry and said he thought it would probably be best not to conclude treaty with Ethio pian Mission which is awaiting his return here but to exchange notes accord ing Ethiopia same position as a treaty power. I said he had now passed from a technical to a political question and that if he consulted me on latter I should probably share his view.

With reference to my despatch No. 219 (1806/138/12) of the 30th July, relative to the return to this country of Sheykh Abdur Rauf as Sabban under the general amnesty declared by Ibn Saud in January last, I have the honour to report that the Umm-al-Qura of the 22nd November announced the recent arrival at Riyadh from Iraq en route for Mecca of Seyyid Muham mad Tahir ad-Dabbagh. This notorious anti-Saudi intriguer has made his peace with Ibn Saud under the terms of the amnesty to political offenders living abroad, and, according to this newspaper’s account, was shown kind ness and hospitality by the King during his visit to Riyadh. Seyyid Muhammad at his audience with Ibn Saud delivered a speech, a report' of which, it is promised, will appear in the next “Umm-al-Qura”. t ^ am senc ^ n £&gt; co pies of this despatch to Bagdad, Aden and Trans- Enclo to S.

He had arrived m Mecca and was accompanied by Sheykh Ahmad al Muiallid having travelled by way of Riyadh where, according to a subsequent’ para graph, he delivered a speech, in the King’s presence, of a laudatory and supplicatory nature. Sheykh Abdur Rauf as-Sabban’s varied past of anti- baudi intrigue, summarised in Jedda Personalities No. 19, Tvould, there fore, appear to have been forgiven. Sheykh Ahmad al-Mujallid does not seem to have come so prominently to notice, but he also is described as having been pardoned by Ibn Saud. { 2 . A similar, but less explicit, reference to Sheykh Abdur Rauf appear ed m the Saut al Hejaz of the 23rd July, which limited itself to the explanation that he was “a Hejazi subject who had stayed for some years at Bagdad the capital of Iraq, our sister country”. 3.

With reference to my despatch No. 277 of the 8th October, relative to ip activities of the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate (Limited), I have t e honour to inform you that the operations of this concern appear to bemailing steady progress. Mr. Twitchell recently informed me that dia mond-drilling, earned out by six Swedish employees of the syndicate, was now proceeding night and day, and that a depth of some 80 feet had been attained. 2 . Since my despatch under reference the personnel of the syndicate has been further increased by the arrival of two British employees, Messrs. Dunckley and McDermott, the former as manager of the Jedda office and the latter, a son of a director of the syndicate, as a surveyor; of two Ame ricans, one Dutchman, one German and one Greek. Mr. C. L. W. Bindloss, the engineer on the Jedda staff of Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co. (Sudan) (Limited), also has now taken up a similar post under the syn dicate. 3. A large quantity of stores, vehicles and machinery, including the diamond drills, have arrived since my despatch under reference, and a great proportion has been successfully transported to the mine, in spite of diffi culties over one stretch of the road Jedda-Asfan-al-Birka-Mahd-adh- Dhahab, on which work is still proceeding. 4. Work is also going on in the construction of houses, built of local stone, at the mine, whilst at Jedda it is reliably stated that the syndicate have acquired an area of some 300 or 400 yards square, about 1 mile north of the town colse to the shore, where it is proposed to erect houses for the staff, workshops store-rooms and garages, and it is also projected in clue course to construct a pier out to deep water to facilitate the loading and unloading of their materials. 5. According to revised estimates, I should now he disposed to place the mine at roughly 23° 30' N. by 41° E. An unconfirmed statement has reached me that an area of 1 square mile has been granted by the syndicate to a company, perhaps a subsidiary company, formed to prospect and exploit that area. 6 .

No. (9)], I have the honour to state that the Umm-al-Qura of Nov- embei 29th published a speech delivered by Muhammad Tahir ad-Dabbagh before King Abdul Aziz at Riyadh. This speech, which is in the nature of a pious recantation, of past errors, is not worth reproducing. It may, however, be of interest to record that Tahir ad-Dabbagh was presented to me by Fuad Bey Hamza at the race-meeting at Riyadh at which I was pre sent on November 25th and that he was a guest at the dinners given in my honour by the King and the Crown Prince on that and the following even- ing. 2 Fuad Bey was full of mischievous glee when he effected the introduc tion at the races. I told ad-Dabbagh that I was glad to see him back in his own country and hoped he would long remain in it; adding that, if he had come back sooner, he would have saved me a great deal of trouble, lie is an eg^-shaped man of perhaps about 45 with slightly converging eyes7 and makes no impression of strength. His relative Huseyn ad-Dabbagh is probably hotter stuff and I think there is some disappointment that he has not also returned so far to the Saudi fold. 3. When speaking privately to Faud Bey about the return of Tahir and connected matters, I took an opportunity of impressing on him the seriousness of the efforts made by the British authorities concerned in and after 1932 to curb the activities of persons engaged in anti-Saudi conspira cies abroad. 4.

Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter, dated 22nd January 1936. Note on Monsieur Khakimov's 'previous career in Jedda. Kerim Khakimov arrived in Jedda on the 6th August 1924. He is a Tartar from Ufa and a Moslem. He was described by Mr. Consul Bullard as very young for the post (about 31 or 32) but clever and an enthusiastic Communist. He spoke Persian very well, besides Russian, Turkish and Turki and was rapidly learning Arabic and French. After a period of inaction he seems to have indulged in violent anti- British propaganda and lost no opportunity of preaching the mission of the Soviet Union to liberate the East. His activities caused some concern to the authorities in Egypt and the Sudan and His Majesty’s High Com missioner in Cairo suggested that it might be advisable to approach Ibn Sand with a view to the suppression of the Soviet Agency. The Acting British Agent, however, expressed the view that M. Kliakimov’s propa ganda was ineffective, that his drunkenness and general behaviour were such as to warn off all but the most stupid and that it would therefore be inadvisable to act on the High Commissioner’s suggestion. M. Khakimov left Jedda on leave in October 1927. In reporting his departure, Mr. Consul Stonehewer-Bird stated that it was unlikely that he would return. He was unfit to stand the climate and was unable to do anything in moderation. He either drank himself into a nervous break down or was a teetotaller. V/ Owing to the mishandling of a Soviet trade “push” by the Charge d’Affaires, M. Khakimov was recalled to Jedda in February 1928. He was worried and depressed over the lack of success of his mission and was very bitter against His Majesty’s Government. He finally left in October and passed through Jedda again in June 1929, on his way to the Yemen, wdiere he had been appointed Soviet commercial representative. He returned to Russia from the Yemen in January 1932. ( GIPD—6'5(C&gt; F&amp;PD—S 2~U-3-aC—_&gt;0I i » No. F 12-N/36, A copy of the undermentioned papers is forwarded to itical. A^ent.

I have the honour to report with regret the death of Sheikh Ahmed bin Awadth Ba Das, Sheikh of Iraq, which took place at Iraq on the 21st October 1935. 2. I have now received a declaration signed by certain relations and tribal Sheikhs, that Sheikh Ahmed bin Abdulla bin Ahmed bin Awadth Ba Das, grandson of the deceased Sheikh, has been elected as his successor as from 22nd October 1935. 3. I believe this election to have been in order and I have therefore accorded recognition to Sheikh Ahmed bin Abdulla bin Ahmed Awadth Ba Das and autho rised the payment to him of the stipend previously enjoyed by his late grandfather, in accordance with the authority contained in Mr. Amery’s despatch No. 22 of the 30th May 1929. ( 20 ) Memorandum No. 24 (389/411/5) dated the 28th February 1936. His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda presents his compliments to His Excellency the Viceroy of India (Foreign and Political Department), and has the honour to transmit to him a copy of despatch to the Foreign Office, No. 59, dated 28th February 1936, regarding Ibn Saud’s visit to Jedda. Enclosure to Serial No. (20). Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 59 (388/411/5), dated the 28th February 1936. I mentioned in my telegram No. 28 of February 24th Ibn Saud’s intention of visiting Jedda. I have now the honour to report more generally on His Majesty’s recent proceedings.2. The King arrived at Riyadh on his return from Kuwait on or about Feb ruary 9th. He left Riyadh again on February 19th and arrived in Mecca on the 22nd. He was accompanied by the Heir Apparent. He came to Jedda early on the 25th attended by the Amir Baud and some of the other junior princes. 3. His Majesty received most of the members of the diplomatic body in the forenoon of February 25th but departed from his usual custom of giving successive audiences to the various heads of missions on his arrival in Jedda. He had to receive the credentials of no less than three new Ministers later in the day and saved time by receiving the other representatives all together, plus one of the new Ministers, M. Maigret, who was already Charge d’Affaires. In these circumstances the audience was even more formal than usual. The King appeared to be in good health and spirits. 4. I am reporting separately on the presentation of their credentials by the new Ministers of the U. S. S. R., Iran and France. By 5 p.m. they had been to see the King and were qualified to attend a reception of all the foreign representatives by the Heir Apparent in the afternoon. On this occasion the proceedings were equally formal but uniform was not worn except by M. Maigret, who had probably had no time to change. It is noteworthy, as a sign of the enhanced position of the Amir Baud, that he held this reception, not in the King’s Palace, but in another house frequently used for ceremonies. 5. On the morning of February 26th I visited the King to present Mr. Maxwell Darling, whose visit to Arabia in connexion with locust research has been the sub ject of other correspondence. His Majesty discoursed in the liveliest possible manner about locusts. He was greatly imbued with the traditional Islamic theory that these insects originate in the interior of a particular kind of fish, which apparently spews them forth on to an inland or islands, whence they fly over the sea to innocent countries like Arabia. I understand from Mr. Philby that this rests on some tradition of the Prophet, not binding (fortunately for Mr. Philby) as an article of faith, but generally accepted by true believers. The King could therefore not be expected to discard it, but he paid a passing tribute to the value of modern scientific research. 6 . The King made no reference to any questions outstanding between Great Britain and Saudi Arabia. Fuad Bey had suggested that I might like to stay on after Mr. Darling’s audience to talk business. His Majesty, however, made no effort to detain me and I myself was glad to retire, as I had not received your final instructions on the major questions and had decided not to follow up at present my request for an audience to : discuss the question of the Government of India dispensaries. Moreover the Soviet and Iranian Ministers were waiting to be received in private audience. 7. The King returned to Mecca on the afternoon of February 26th. There were no festivities during his stay. I had by way of precaution warned Fuad Bey that, while I could attend a formal audience to pay respects, I should be pre vented by Court mourning from attending anything in the nature of a social functions. 8 . Great precautions have been taken in Mecca for some time past to limit the number of possible undesirables during the pilgrimage. Some of the measures taken have been harsh. They accord with the recent Saudi policy of discouraging destitutes from making the pilgrimage, discouraging also the use of unauthorised routes and diminishing vagrancy, but they are also attributed to the determination of the authorities to guard against any attempt on the King’s life, similar to that of last March. Reports have been set afloat regarding his own nervousness and the arrival of suspicious Yemenis in various places. These may be dismissed as un convincing but the overland pilgrimage from the Yemen is expected to be numerous and I am told that there is much apprehension among the inhabitants of Mecca, who are more gossipy than courageous. 9. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Government of India. ( 21 ) Memorandum No. 25 (391/118/7), dated the 28th February 1936. His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda presents his compliments to H.

With reference to my despatch No. 40 of February 4th [Enclosure to Serial No (13)], I have the honour to state that Monsieur Soltan Ahmed Khan Had presented his credentials as Iranian Minister at the Court to His Majesty King Abdul Aziz on February 25th. 2. I have met M. Rad more than once and have found him pleasant and I should say reasonably intelligent. His diplomatic experience outside Iran seems to have been smaU. He served m the Persian Embassy in Constantinople for a couple of years not long before the Great War but has spent most of his official life at home under various departments of the Iranian Government, including the Ministry of I oreign Affairs, under which he served as “ Karguzar ” in the provinces, and the Ministry of Justice. He had been President of a section of the Court of Cassation tor six or seven years before he was appointed to Cairo about two years ago He speaks French fairly well and appears to have a good knowledge of Arabic besides a knowledge of Turkish which I have not tested. 3. M. Rad has no intention of spending much of his time in this country He told me on February 10th that he might not even leave a secretary here on his return to Egypt but simply close the Legation in Jedda, which serves no useful purpose except to a small extent round about pilgrimage time. 4 . We have not yet met Madame Rad, who came here with her husband. I understand that she is only semi-veiled and is willing to appear in society.

Although this memorandum includes ct.r am information which has already been reported to your Department, it adds a good deal that has come to the knowledge of the Legation since the date of the despatch under reference and gives a useful comprehensive picture of what has become the most important industrial enterprise in the west of Saudi Arabia I therefore enclose a copy of it, 2.

Work on tlie road from Jedda to the Mahd is still in progress, and I under stand that as far as approximately 72 miles from Jedda the road may be described, from the point of view of light motor transport, as good. The central portion of the total distance still presents difficulty, but the syndicate are now equipped with modern road-making machinery. Activity also continues at the Jedda “ ter minal ’ of the road, where the construction ot the compound referred to in para graph 4 of the despatch under reference, on an area now stated to be 300 by 150 yards, is proceeding steadily. 4. I am sending copies of this despatch and enclosure to the Department of Overseas Trade and to His Excellency the High Commissioner for Transjordan. Enclosure. Memorandum respecting the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate (Limited) Mining Concession, dated the 11th January 1936. (a) Areas being worked, or about to be worked (or prospected in the near future). The operations of the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate commenced in March 1935 at the Mahd-adli-Dhahab (position according to latest estimates at 23 degrees 30 minutes north by 41 degrees east) and near Yanbu The latter workings, where Mr. Shanks was engaged, were abandoned in the early summer, but the former have continued and have been developed with considerable prospects of success. Under the terms of the original concession reported to the Foreign Office by Sir Andrew Ryan’s despatch No. 56 of the 24th February 1935 [Serial No. (31) in File No. 1-N./35)], by which areas which it is desired to prospect further should be designated within one year, and areas for exploitation must be fixed and subsidiary exploitation companies formed within two years of the date of the concession, it is becoming a matter of urgency to determine the areas which can be worked profit ably. Mr. Shanks has been away prospecting for the past two months or more (he returned on the 21st December, 1935), but had not had much success. His pros pecting trip is believed to have taken him in an easterly and north-easterly direc tion, well into Nejd, almost but not quite as far as the Jebel Hilit (see below). At the end of 1935 arrangements were stated to be under way for four separate prospecting parties to go out into the concessionary area, the districts to be ex plored being, it is said, Yanbu’ (in spite of previous failure in that neighbourhood). Wejh and two others not at present definitely known. M. Van de Poll left for Wejh about the end of December in this connexion. (b) Facts known as regards handing over the Mahd to an Exploitation Company. The little we know on this subject may be summarised as follows. The first mention, I believe, was by a member of the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate to a member of the Legation early in August, 1935. This was reported to the Foreign Office in our despatch No. 227 of the 6th August, 1935 [Serial No. (57) in File No. 1-N./35]. Towards the end of October, 1935, another member of the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate stated that the syndicate had given “ the new company ” one square mile to survey, a conversation which was reported in our despatch No. 339 of the 26fch November, 1935 [Serial No. (10)], paragraph 5. It is difficult to determine from these brief references whether the Mahd itself is to be turned over to the subsidiary (it seems most probable) , or whether an adja cent area is being made over to it, or both. (c) Facts known or surmised regarding Difficulties with the Saudi Arab Govern ment. Difficulties are believed to have arisen with the Saudi Arab Government over the definition of the boundaries to the original concession. These boundaries are given at paragraph 2 of the enclosure to Sir Andrew Ryan’s despatch to the Foreign Office No. 56 of the 24th February 1935, and were published in the Umm-al-Qura of the 12th February, 1935. In December 1935 a member of the Legation staff had access for a short time to a map in possession of the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate, on which a boundary line was traced. This was MS132FD B13 observed to run as follows : Birk-Raghdan—Barq Samuda (not cn Hunter’s map but about 21 degrees 30 minutes by 41 degrees 30 minutes'—Ashaira—Marran— Iqbah—Point 7 miles east of Malid-adh-Dhahab—Amaq—Hanakiya—Hadiya— 2500 mark of Hunter's map on Transjordan frontier near Itraif, thence along the de facto Hejaz-Transjordan frontier to Aqaba. The difference between this alignment and the published version relates principally to the area in the neigh bourhood of the Mahd. It would appear that the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndi cate are likely to lose, owing to miscalculation of the position of the Mahd and/or Jureysiya, a considerable slice of territory. The extent of this loss is not altogether clear although it probably forms a salient into the concessionary area, but whether of 7 miles depth or a larger area, due to an important inaccuracy in fixing the posi tion of the Mahd, is not apparent. This is, of course, the main difficulty. Related to it, and indeed perhaps part of it, is the difficulty recorded in my minute of the 21st December 1935, where it is described how Mr. Shanks was not permitted by an obstructive Amir of Medina to prospect as far east as the Jebel Hilit, an area, however, I should have thought would under any interpretation be well outside the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndi cate concession. Minor difficulties have been experienced and smoothed away, e.g., over employ ing Nejdi as well as Hejazi labour. (d) New Recruits, with general Idea of Distribution. Staff arrivals and departure have been recorded pretty faithfully in our des patches to the Foreign Office. Since the last one No. 339 of the 26th November 1935 [Serial No. (10)], the following have arrived :— S. C. Bullock—(British), arrived December 21, 1935. J. Walker—(American), arrived December 15, 1935. ? Shaw—(American), arrived ? December 29, 1935. ? Cezanne—(? French), arrived ? December 29, 1935. The total strength of the syndicate’s personnel is now approximately twenty- five Europeans and Americans, the majority of whom are employed at the mine or prospecting, and over 700 labourers, etc., at the Mahd-adh-Dhahab. The com position of the European and American personnel of the syndicate, by nationalities may be of some interest and is, approximately, as follows :— British Swedes American Dutch German Greek ..

Reference to previous correspondence : Jedda printed despatch No. 24 of 28th February 1936 [Enclosure to Serial No. (20)].14 Enclosure to Serial No. (23). Letter from His Majesty’s Minister, Jedda to the Foreign Office, No. 77 (488/411/8), dated the 18th March 1936. With reference to my despatch No. 59 of February 28th [Enclosure to Serial No. (20)] relative to the recent proceedings of Ibn Saud, I have the honour to state that the King would appear to have taken part in the pilgrimage normally, except that unusual police precautions were taken to obviate the possibility of his being attacked in the same way as last year. 2. The King gave his usual dinner to notable pilgrims on February 29th and delivered his usual speech. To judge by the report published in the Umm-al-Qura, the speech presented few features of interest. It abounded in the cust mary commendations of Islam. His Majesty reproached Moslems with saying much and doing little. Jews and Christians, he observed, were in the habit of not acting in accordance with their professions. Moslems should not follow their example. He adjured all Moslems and in particular Arabs to bethink themselves, to return to the right path and to be united. Many of his co-religionists, he went on, held that the reason why Moslems were backward was that they did not follow the ways of civilisation. This was an error, because Islam did not prevent its adherents from adopting anything useful, provided it did not touch their faith. He urged fidelity to religious duties, the most important of which was the performance of the pil grimage. 3. The same issue of the paper quoted elsewhere an utterance of the King at the banquet, which does not appear in the main report of his speech. This referred to the closeness of the relations between the peoples of Nejd and Iraq, which were of old standing. He spoke of the Nejdi origin of many inhabitants of Iraq. Iraq and its people were, he said, dear to him and to all his subjects. Their progress brought pleasure to his heart and he wished them advancement and success. This passage may have some political significance in connexion with the present negotia tions between the two countries, which, as you know, were suspended for the pilgrimage and the ensuing festival. 4. The King was not so absorbed in his religious duties at pilgrimage time as to be indifferent to developments abroad. Fuad Bey Hamza surprised me by ringing me up on the first day of the festival to enquire about a report that the Negus, had, in some way or other, which I did not quite grasp, made a move for peace. When I told him what I knew of the appeal to both combatants by the Committee of Thirteen, he explained that the King was worried by the difficulty of getting trustworthy news of what was happening. It seems odd that the Saudis should be able to take so little advantage of their wireless sets. They seem to listen in principally to Cairo. Several days after my direct conversation with Fuad Bey on March 4th, they were still worried and consulted Mr. Philby, who telephoned to his wife, who had recourse to mine, who was able to supply some particulars about wavelengths and all that. 5. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Government of India and Bagdad. (24) Memorandum No. 27 (454/86/14), dated the 11th March 1936. His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda presents his compliments to H. E. the Viceroy of India (Foreign and Political Department), and has the honour to transmit to him a copy of despatch to the Foreign Office, No. 71, dated the 11th March 1936, regarding the stranding of the s.s. “ Kawsar ” on a reef near Jedda.

Letter from His Majesty’s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 71(452/86/14), dated the 11th March 1936. With reference to Mr. Calvert’s despatch No. 325 of November 12th [Enclosure to Serial No. (67) in File No. 1-N./35] and previous correspondence relative to the activities of Talast Pasha Harb and the Banque Misr group in connexion with this country, it maybe worth while to report that the s.s. “ Kawsar ” of the Misr Naviga tion Company ran ashore on the Irk-Al-Ghorab reef about nineteen miles south west of Jedda early on February 28th. This ship was carrying the last important contingent of pilgrims from Egypt, including Princes Khadija, sister of the ex- Khedive and widow of the late Abbas Helim Pasha. The master of the ship is an Italian, who has, I understand, been in charge of her on previous voyages to Jedda and I have heard no plausible suggestion as to what misled him out of the usual course. 2. The “ Zamzam ”, the other pilgrim ship of the Misr Navigation Company, was in port at the time and went to the assistance of the “ Kawsar ”, whose pilgrims were duly landed in good time for the pilgrimage. The “ Kawsar” herself, however, had been steaming at a rate of some thirteen knots and was very firmly stranded on the reef. Efforts by the “ Zamzam ” to tow her cfi had to be abondoned after three or four days and on the evening of March 9th a salvage contract was signed with the agents of Lambert Brothers, Limited, who had sent a salvage tug from Perim to stand by on the chance of its services being required. The “ Kawsar ” was refloated March 9th or 10th and came into port early on the 10th. 3 . The “Kawsar” would appear to be a very solidly built vessel and has appa rently sustained comparatively little damage. Nevertheless the accident may delay somewhat the arrangements for the return of the numerous Egyptian Pilgrims now in this country. Princess Khadija had already arranged to proceed to Medi na en route for Egypt by air and left Jedda on or abeut March 12th in an aeroplane, which had been sent from Cairo. 4 . It is also worth recording that a start has been made this year with the use of aircraft for the pilgrimage. No general air service from Egypt was organised but, apart from the Princess Khadija’s aeroplane, three other small machines belong ing to Misr Airwork arrived in Jedda from Cairo with a party of pilgrims. I understand that four had started and that the party included two cadets of the Egyptian Royal family but one of the machines, and I believe one of the young princes, got into difficulties at one or more places on the coastal route in the Northern Hejaz and failed to arrive in Jedda. 5 . lam sending copies of this despatch to the Department of Overseas Trade, the Government of India, Cairo and the Senior Naval Officer, Red Sea Sloops, (25) Memorandum No. 31(578/240/7), dated the 28th March 1936.

I am addressing you separately on those which related to the customs tariff and the currency system. 2. One other measure of considerable importance was sandwiched between two notices regarding customs arrangements under a general heading showing that all three had been sanctioned by royal decree. This empowered the Ministry16 of Finance to levy a yearly tax of 5 per cent, the rent on all properties in the Kingdom but not on a rental basis. 1 roperty occupied by the owner is exempted, subject to a provision that the tax must be paid on any portion of the property let to another occupant. Provision is made for the compilation of lists of rented pro- perties and for the imposition of the tax as from the beginning of the lunar year looo. ine tax is payable by the owner of the property. v?' } ^ sendm g copies of this despatch to the Government of India, Foreign and 1 olitical Department and to the Department of Overseas Trade.

Muhammad Sadiq was omitted from the banquet, possibly for some political reason, but he too seems to be favourably re garded in certain high Saudi circles. He did not come so much to the attention of His Majesty’s Government as various other conspirators, when the Saudi Govern ment were raging against them in and about 1932, but he has some importance in this country, as he commanded for a time the forces which defended Jedda for the Hashimites at the time of the Saudi invasion of the Hejaz. 3. I take the oportunity of correcting a misapprehension, under which I have laboured for some time regarding the Directorate of Education and which I may have conveyed to others. I was under the impression that the Saudi Minister in London was still theoretically Director General of Education and that the late working hand of the Department, another Egyptian named Ibrahim Shura, was Director. Fuad Bey tells me that Sheykh Hafiz Wahba vacated the department on his appointment to London but that it was not filled. Ibrahim Shura, the Director of the “ Sand Institute ” in Mecca, was made acting director. He has now reverted to his post at the Saudi Institute on the appointment of Ad-Dabbagh to the substantive post of Director of Education. 1 4. I am sending copies of this despatch to Baghdad, Aden, Trans-Jordan and the Government of India. I have the honour to be with the highest respect. (27) Memorandum No. 33 (595/238/10), dated the 29th March 1936. His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda presents his compliments to H. E the Viceroy of India (Foreign and Political Department), and has the honour to transmit to MS132FD17 him a copy of despatch to the Foreign Office, No. 95-E., dated the 29th March 1936 and enclosure, regarding Currency and Coinage position in the Hejaz.. Enclosure I to Serial No. (27). Letter from His Majesty’s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 95- E.-(594/238/10), dated the 29th March 1936. You are aware that the currency situation in this country has undergone many vicissitudes since Ibn Saud conquered the Hejaz. These have been particularly marked since early in 1931, owing to the brakedown in practical application of the regulations enclosed in Mr. Bird’s despatch No. 12 (196/196/1) of January 20th, 1928 and the further confusion entailed by the suspension of the gold standard in Great Britain in the autumn of that year. The English gold pound has remained throughout the main basis of the Saudi currency system but the market value of the Saudi silver riyal was in and after 1931 far below the official parity of ten riyalst to the gold pound established by the regulations of 1928. 2 . It may be well to recall very briefly the genesis of the system established by the regulations of 1928. The main elements in the pre-war Turkish currency wxre the Turkish gold pound, similar in fineness to, but about *9 per cent, of the weight, of the English sovereign ; and the famous silver coin called the Mejidie which, though it had depreciated somewhat, stood for many years in a fixed relation to gold. The Turkish gold pound was divided theoretically into 100 gold piastres although the gold piastre did not exist as a coin. It ensued from this that the English gold pound was worth 110 gold piastres. The mejidie and its sub divisions, which included a current silver piastre, had various values according to the uses to which it was put but for official purposes it was reckoned at about 102 piastres to the Turkish gold pound and about 112 piastres to the English gold pound. The market rate was lower. I quote these figures from memory but they are sufficiently accurate for my present purpose. 3. The Saudi regulations of 1928 suhstituted for the mejidie and its sub divisions Saudi silver riyals of exctly the same size, weight and silver content and established the legal parity, already mentioned, of ten riyals to the English gold pound, which had more or less superseded the Turkish gold pound. By an adapta tion of the old Turkish rates for gold, they provided that the English gold pound and the riyal respectively should be divided into 110 and 11 thecietical piastres called “ mini ”, which corresponded to the Turkish “ gold piastres ’ and into 220 and 22 current piastres, which came to be known as Saudi. 4. From 1931 to 1934 the Saudi riyal fluctuated greatly, the general tendency being in the direction of depreciation, subject to seasonal variations in the opposite sense. Last year, however, the riyal, while still well below its legal value in terms of gold, showed a tendency to appreciate. There appeared to be a shortage of silver currency and early in the autumn the Saudi Government cast about for means of remedying the situation. They had already begun to import large quantities of Indian rupees, mainly for use in Nejd, where the Saudi riyal had never been popular ^ and had never ousted the Maria Theresa dollar. They also contemplated a new’ issue of silver riyals, a project which has formed the subject of correspondence ending with my Chancery’s letter to the Eastern Department of February 1st last. I may add that after that letter was written, I had reason to suppose that the new riyals were to be similar, except for the Saudi superscription, to the Indian rupee ; that the quantity ordered, including presumably silver sub-divisions, was riyals 1 ,000,000 ; and that the parity of the new riyals would be fixed at Riyals 20 to the gold pound. One informant suggested to me that the existing riyals would be withdrawn and that the new issue would suffice for all requirements, a thing which I find it difficult to believe unless the rupees from India are used to eke out the official currency not only in Nejd but in the Hejaz. 5. Pending the issue of the new riyals, of which I have heard nothing further, the Saudi Ministry of Finance has sprung a fresh surprise on the public by publish ing on March 23rd a notice, which I enclose in translation. Its main effects appear to be to establish a new legal parity of the existing riyal at the rate of 20 to the gold pound for the purpose of transactions with the Government; to abolish the “ miri ” piastre ; to readjust the relation between Saudi piastres and the other elements in the currency by calculating the gold pound at 220 Saudi piastres, the riyal at 11IS pi stres and the nickel piastre at half a Saudi piastre. Paragraph 4 provides that payments to the Government hitherto fixed in miri piastres shall be payable in Siudi piastres to double the number of miri piastres shown in the tariffs, etc. Thus the English gold pound reijiains the basis of currency as before but the existing riyal is officially de-valued to a rate approximating to that to which it had fallen, though with variations, in the market. 6. I prefer to postpone further comment on the new arrangements until I know more of their practical application. They produced some emotion in the markets of Jedda and Mecca for a day or two, but this seems to have died down, on its being discovered that market transactions in riyqls are i not necessarily effected though they may be influenced by the Government arrangements. The first effect in the local money markets was marked fall in the vafiie of the riyal. The perma nent effect is difficult to estimate. It is possible that the who'e thing is a preclude to the issue of the new riyals but I confess my inability to see at present what the modus operandi is likely to be., if this should be the ca e. 7. I am sending copies of this despatch and enclosure to the Department of Overseas Trade, the Government of India and Cairo, Enclosure 2 to Serial No. (27). Translation, Instructions from the Ministry of Finance concerning rates of exchange, enacted with a view to stabilising the Saudi Arab currency. 1. The piastre known as the gold piastre shall be deemed to be out of use and shall be superseded by the Saudi piastre. 2. The Saudi riyal shall be deemed to be equal to eleven Saudi piastres, and the small nickel coins shall be calculated at the rate of two piastres to one Saudi piastre, 3. The English gold pound shall be accepted at the rate of P. 220 Saudi in selling and buying. 4. As certgiu revenues are based on the gold piastre, the amount specified therein shall be doubled when calculated in Saudi piastres. 5. As to the revenues originally based on the Saudi piastre, they shall be re ceived on the same basis, namely, at the rate of P. 220 Saudi to one gold English- pound and P. 11 to one Saudi riyal, and P. 2 of the nickel coins to one piastre. 6. The Ministry of Finance, its branches and the revenue Departments shall accept such revenues in the different kinds of coins officially defined, namely, the English gold pound, the Saudi riyal and the nickel piastres at the rates now decided as they may be offered to them from the people concerned in payment of Govern ment revenues. 7. This decision shall come into force as from the beginning of Muharram 1355 (23rd March 1936). ( 28 ) (Received on 26th April 1936, with Political Secretary's letter No. 15, dated the 9ih April 1936.) Enclosure in Foreign Office coverning letter dated the 6th April 1936. Letter from His Majesty’s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 42 (262/116/31, DATED THE 4TH FEBRUARY 1936. With reference to Mr. Calvert’s despatch No. 275 of 7th October, I have the honour to state that M. Maigrot, the French Charge d’Affaires here, returned to Jedda on 18th January in the French sloop d’Iberville, which called only to land him and a member of his staff and left the same day. M. Maigret left a^ain on 26th January, intending to proceed via Port Sudan and Hudeyda to San’a and to return about 10th February in the d’Iberville, which will call for him at Hudeyda. 2. It is now known that the status of the French Consulate here was raised to that of a Legation by a French law promulgated, I believe, last July and that M. Maigret has been given the rank of Minister Resident. These changes have notyet been officially aitnotincedf to his colleagues in Jedda but I understand that the' new Legation is to be inaugurated with some ceremony on M. Maigret’s return and that the d'Iberville which has on board Hear Rivet, Commanding Officer of the French naval division in the Levant, will stay for the celebration. I believe that Ibn baud intends to come to the Hejaz a few days ear.ier than he need do to attend the Pilgrimage and will visit Jedda to receive the credentials of no less than three Ministers, viz., M. Maigret, the recently arrived Minister of the U. S. S. R. (see my despatch No. 358 of 17th December 1935) and the Iranian IVlinister, whose arrival 1 am reporting in a separate despatch. 3. I have thought these developments worthy of being recorded in a spec'al report but I doubt whether any real political significance attaches either to M* Maigret s visit to San a or to the changes affecting the French representaLon in Jedda. As you are aware M. Maigret plays no important role here. He is a fairly well-informed observer of events but he has not visited France for some years and continues to give the impression of having little pull with the French Government. He has a much greater connexion with Syria and the French authorities there. He has vague leanings towards Islam and is, I think, on the best of terms with King Abdul Aziz and the Saudi Government but even with them he does not apper to carry much weight. I believe that the creation of a Legation and M. Maigret’s promotion are more than anything else the realisation of his own moderate ambitions and would have taken place sooner but for financial consideration in Paris.

With reference to my despatch No. 358 of December 17th, 1935, I have the honour to state that Monsieur Karim Khakimov, the new Soviet Minister here arrived in Jedda on January 21st, accompanied by the Secretary, Monsieur Ali (not Galei) Fattahov, the person referred to in Lord Chilston’s telegram No. 165 of December 21st. 2 . M. Khak'mov presented his letters of credence to King Abdul-Aziz on February 25th. 3. The new Minister, of whom we have seen a little since his arrival, promises to be an agreeable colleague. He speaks French rather imperfectly, English not at all and Arabic and Turkish fairly well. As reference was made in the enclosure in my despatch under reference to his lack of moderation, I ought to say that it now manifests itself in abstention rather than excess, so far as alcohol is concerned.20 4. It may be worth adding that the Vice-Consul M. Chakir Ismailoff, who wag left in charge of the Legation ot the U. S. R. R. in the departure of the late Minister left for San a on February 17th, with the ostensible object of visiting a colleague who is employed in the Russian commercial service there. 5.

Letter from His Majesty’s Minister, Jedda oe the Foreign Office, No. 118 (765/577/15), dated the 25th April 1936. You will remember that at the close of the Saudi Yeman war of 1934 Ibn Saud secured the surrender of Seyyid Hasan Al Idrisi and two other important members of the family Abdul-Wahhab and Abdul-Aziz, the latter of whom died last year. A rumour recently reached me that another member of the Idrisi family described by my informant as “ Seyyid Al-Arab ”, had arrived in Jeddah last February and had been taken to Mecca, where the others are allowed to reside aftei the Italian Legation here had obtained guarantees for his being well-treated 2. 1 was inclined, if there was anything in the story at all, to identify the person m question with Seyyid Mohamad-Al-Arabi, son of Abdul-al, son of the onginal Ahmed-Al-Idnsi, i.e., one of that branch of the family which is associated principally with the Sadan and Egypt. This man’s submission to Ibn Saud would be of some little importance, as he was one of the Asiri delegation who came to Mecca in October 1930 in connexion with the arrangements for the absorption of Asir into the Ibn Sand’s dominions but was afterwards concerned in the revolt of Seyyid Hasan in November-December 1932. It was understood that, after the collapse of the rebellion, he went with a nephew of his to Massawa which might account for the alleged Italian interest in him. ° 3. I took an apportunity to-day of asking Shaykh Yusuf Yasin whether Seyyid Al Arabi had arrived in Mecca. He replied that he had, he thought, been there for a year or so ; any how he had seen him there before he himself left for Riyadh last November. In view of this information, which I have no reason to doubt, it now seems to me probable that my previous informant’s sources were confusing two things, viz., the presence of Al Arabi in Mecca sometime ago and the more recent arrival from Jizan of certain other persons, whom I cannot indentify but who are said to have been landed m Jedda m conditions of some secrecy and conveyed to Mecca. Conflicting rumours have reached me regarding the composition of this party and the reasons for their being sent here. I am not, however, pursuing this matter, as my object has merely been to locate Al-Arabi for the reason given in the preceding paragraph. 4. I am sending copies of this despatch to his Majesty’s High Commissioner for Egypt, Cairo, His Excellency the Governor General of the Sudan, Khartoum, His Majesty s Chief Commissioner at Aden and to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department at New Delhi.

Letter from His Majesty s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 90-E. (575/416/2), dated the 28th March 1936. With reference to my despatch No. 71 of March 11th [Enclosure to Serial No. (24)], I have the honour to submit to your notice a point of some little interest,' which has been raised m connexion with the visit to Jedda of the salvage tu &lt;jr Preserver, which refloated the s. s. “ Kawsar ”. 2. The Preserver entered the port of Jedda on her first arrival here and then proceeded to the Irk-al-Ghorab reef, where the '‘Kawsar” was aground. After effecting the salvage she entered the port a second time. On this second entry the local authorities did not ask for payment of the usual tonnage dues a second time but insisted that, under the regulations in force, the fixed dues of one pound gold for entry and two pounds gold for permission to employ a pilot must be paid aga n. Mr. Griffin, a member of the firm which represents the owners of the Preserver drew ray attention to the difference in the practice followed in regard to the tonnage22 allies and of the fixed dues and asked my views as to whether the fixed dues could fee claimed twice. He mentioned inter alia the fact that the same pilot remained on board the Preserver throughout the proceedings. 3. The most second recent Saudi regulations of which I have knowledge are those enclosed in translation in Mr. Calvert’s despatch No. 292-E. of September 24th, 1934. The tonnage dues, although described by Mr. Griffin as “ quarantine ” clues, would appar to be those prescribed under head 1 of the Appendix to the regulations. The fixed dues are clearly those under heads 6 and 7. It seems to me probable that the reason for not charging tonnage dues twice was that the dues are payable only on arrival from and departure for a foreign port; but that the authorities regard the fixed dues as being payable on any entry into the port from the high seas. 4. I told Mr. Griffin that in my opinion it would be difficult to contest the action of the local authorities in charging the fixed dues twice, especially as any attempt on my part to do so might be held to imply that I regarded the reef as being within -Saudi territorial waters. I promised, however, as he attached importance to the principle, though not to the amount involved, to ascertain your views generally, and with special reference to the question whether immunity from the double payment could be claimed in virtue of any recognised practice in cases where a ship lying in a port Las occasion to leave it temporarily for a point of the high seas in the vicinity. 5. I at first thought of discussing the matter informally with the Saudi Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs before reporting, it. On finding that the distinction made by the authorities could be plausibly explained as in paragraph 3 above, I decided that I might do more harm than good by approaching Faud Bey, I ■shall be grateful for an expression of your views on the whole subject.

M ; Maigret told me to-day that he had practically completed the negotia tions during his last visit to San a. At the last moment, however, the Yemeni mister for Foreign Affairs dropped out of the negotiations for some reason (probably, I think, illness), and the King of the Yemen had appointed another adviser to take his place. This gentleman, wishing to show zeal, took exception to certain phrases, and the negotiations could not be completed. The French Government had now agreed to the amendments desired by the Yemeni Govern ment and there was no further obstacle to the conclusion of the Treaty. . ^ 3 - M - Maigret described the Treaty as being a simple and rather anodyne mstrument, but I gathered that it contains certain commercial provisions.

Bideford, together with an extract from the covering remarks of the Commander-in-Chief, East Indies Station, covering the period 14th to 17th April 1936. (Extract from remarks by the Commander-in-Chief, East Indies Station dated the 28th April 1936.) 2. The Commanding Officer, H. M. S. Bideford, has been instructed to forward this flag to the Naval Officer-in-Charge, Aden, for retention and issue to H. M. Ships visiting Shehr and Mukalla in normal circumstances, since it was made to the design of His Highness the Sultan. ******** His Highness the Sultan Salab Bin Galab Alkaity Sultan of Shehr and Mukalla, came abroad H. M. S. Bideford at 0915, on 14th April 1936. He was accompanied by his son, Prince Sultan Amad Bin Sultan Galab, his Political Minister and Secretary in India, Khan Bahadur Shaik Ali Baakza, J. P., his Personal Secretary, Nawab Ahmed Beg Khan (a relative of His’Highness), his Aide de (-amp, Mosin Bin Syead, an Arabic clerk and five servants. 2. A Guard was paraded when His Highness came abroad and the usual marks of respect were paid. At 0930 H. M. S. Bideford sailed for Mukalla. 3. Two cabins had been allotted to His Highness and his son, and the after end ot the Quarter Deck screened off for the remainder of the party. His Highness and Personal Staff, however, had other ideas as to what thev required, and annexed the after end of the Boat Deck for use bv day, and slept within the enclosure on the Quarter Deck by night. ******* His Highness, his son and the three Personal Staff messed with me, the remainder feeding on the Quarter Deck. 5. The ship anchored off Mukalla at 1705 on 15th April 1936. A great number of native boats came out to welcome His Highness, while the shore was lined with thousands of people. A Guard was paraded when His Highness left the ship and a salute of eleven guns fired. A flag of suitable size has been made on board during the passage to His Highness’s design, and was flown when the boat went ashore. This flag consisted of a green Star and Crescent on a red background. It was noticed, however, that all the flags flown ashore at Mukalla were the usual plain red Mohammedan flag. When he arrived ashore His VHighness received an enthusiastic welcome. A saluting gun ashore tired a slow eleven-gun salute and a great crowd followed his car to the Palace. , , 6 - Before leaving the ship, His Highness had asked if I would dine informally with him that evening and bring as many of my officers as possible. Four officers and myself landed at 1930 and were met by two cars, in which we were driven to the Palace. The streets were lined with people and police were stationed every fifty yards, blowing whistles to clear the streets. Several police detachments turned out and presented arms as we passed. On arriving at the Palace T was surprised to find a Guard of about fifty file and a Band drawn up m charge of an Indian Armv Instructor. Several regiments appeared to be represented. A salute was played and I then inspected the guard, who were extremely smart. In spite ot the fact that the Palace had been unoccupied while ills Highness was away, it was in good order and luxuriously furnished. After dinner, which was served in the European manner, and the usual formalities, my officers and I were driven back to the landing place, the police detachments again ti rnmg out and even the meanest inhabitant standing up and salaaming as we passed. ® -n, 7' r&gt;le Shl P’ s Company were landed in two parties next morning to see round the town at 0630 and 0830. Cars were put at their disposal by His Highness. IJiree officers also landed and were shown round by His Highness’s Doctor. • Bl( Jefo rd sailed for Aden at Noon on 16th April 1936, and arrived at 1630 on 17th April. 1936. tj- u-V vas mfor ™ ed that Ml ikalla has a population of about 30,000 and that His Highness maintains a standing army of 2,000 infantry and also a cavalry regiment. Mukalla has also a large and apparently efficient police force. The natives appear extremely loyal and contented. A Wireless Station has recently rfk ttm 7 n \ th0 w gh v complete ’ 18 a°t yet in commission. The Palace alone is lit b\ Electric Light, but a large plant has been ordered from England and in tlie near future it is hoped to light the entire town by electricity.

M.’s Minioter, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 68 dated the 23rd May 1936. I made comtamnication orally to Yussuf Yasin on Mav 21st. Mv Italian co league had previously notified the Saudi-Arabian Government in writing of the Italian Government’s decision. Yussuf Yasin had again seen him on the receipt ot this communication and re-asserted the views of the Saudi-Arabian Government regarding the effects of their neutrality. As a result of this conversation it had been decided to return no further answer. Yussuf Yasin consulted me as to the correctness of his view that such silence would not commit his Government m any way. I expressed the opinion that if the Saudi-Arabian Government had made their contention clear in conversation after receiving Italian communication, no further reply was necessary. Attitude of the Saudi- Araman Government seemed to me, I said, analogous to that of His Maiestv’s Government subject to the difference that it was based on neutrality whereas (licit ot His Majesh s Government rested on other principles. 2 . I do not of course know exactly what Yussuf Yasin said to my Italian colleague, but I am satisfied that the Saudi-Arabian Government have no intention of committing themselves prematurely to the recognition of Italian annexation.

K 2,02jo6|25 of 21st May [Serial No. (36-A)], enclosing a copy of27 Jedda telegram No. 63 of 13th May and of Mr. Eden’s reply thereto on the subject of Italian relations with Saudi Arabia and the Yemen. 2. Mr. Eden has had under consideration, with reference to Sir Andrew Ryan’s telegram No. 63 (ibid), the possibly increasing danger of Italy embark ing on some new adventure in the Yemen. Although the balance of probability still seems to be against Italy attempting further acts of aggression in this area, the danger of her doing so clearly cannot be altogether excluded and it therefore seems desirable that every effort should be made to obtain a regular and rapid supply of such information as may be available which may have any bearing on the question. 3. I am accordingly to suggest, for the consideration of the Secretary of State for the Colonies that the Resident at Aden might' usefully be instructed to keep a special watch on the situation, and to report by telegraph at frequent intervals whether there are any signs of increasing Italian activity in South West Arabia. 4. Possibly Sir B. Reilly may even consider it desirable that a special officer should be sent to the Yemen to observe and report on any developments in this direction. 5. Copies of this letter are being sent to the India Office, Admiralty, and Air Ministry. (40) (Received on 21st June 1936, with Political Secretary's letter No. 23, dated 4th June 1936.) Enclosure in Colonial Office, covering letter, dated 27th May 1936. Telegram from H. M.’s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 57 dated the 30th April 1936. Yusuf Yasin informed me yesterday confidentially and again under instruc tions of the King, that Italian Government had recently offered to give Saudi Arabian Government six aeroplanes, three for training purposes and three for ci\ il use. The offer had been accepted in accordance with general policy of preserving the appearance of friendly relations with Italy but the King’s fundamental policy of friendship with His Majesty’s Government remained unalterable. I said that your last expression of views regarding transactions with Italy was not fresh in my memory but that I thought general view of His Majestv’s Government in this case would be that while the matter was one for the judgment of the Saudi Arabian Government, the Italian offer should be regarded with caution in view of the possibility of political or other ulterior motives. Yusuf Yasin declared the utmost caution had been used ; the Italian Charo-e d’Affaires had assured him that the sole motive was interest in the development ot aviation in this country to which the Italian Government had collaborated bv training students sent to Italy last year. My Italian colleague had confirmed this in writing at the request of the Saudi-Arabian Government. I expressed doubt whether (grp. omtd.) gave presents on this scale for nothing. XT Having refreshed my memory of correspondence ending with your telegram said 0 ’ ^ t0 ^ ^ USuf Yasin to -day that it necessitated no addition to what I had (41) Memorandum No. 51 (1023|112|1), dated the 2nd June 1936.

Witli reference to my despatch No. 105 of lApril 4th, 1935, relative to the appointment of Sheykh Muhammad Sadiq-al-Mojaddidi as Afghan Minister here, I have the honour to state that in recent months a situation of acute tension has grown up between this gentleman and the Saudi Government. I do not think it necessary to devote a special despatch to the details of their quarrels but, in case they should later have any repercussion on the relations between this country and Afghanistan, I would draw your attention to the account given, as a matter of general interest, in paragraphs 192 to 194 of the Jedda Report for May. 2 . M. Mojaddidi took up his permanent residence here on November 3rd last, after the closing of the Afghan Legation in Cairo, which was reported in Sir Miles Lampson’s despatch to you No. 1282 of November 8th. He had recruited two secretaries, an Afghan and an Egyptian, the first of whom went on leave a short time ago, while the second is leaving Jedda this week without any intention of returning. The Minister himself has spent much of his time in Mecca and Medina. 3. I take the opportunity of correcting a mistake in the Report on heads of missions enclosed in my despatch No. 20 of January 13th. Al-Mojaddidi has a wife and several young children in Jedda, about six, I think, besides several other children elsewhere. 4 ; I am sending copies of this despatch to Cairo, the Government of India and Kabul.

I forward the translation as received, with the exception of the Ethiopian names, the spelling of which I have taken the liberty to change to accord with custom. 2.

Tfie enclosures in Mr. Hope (rill's despatch to the Foreign Office No. 213 of May 18fh 1932, [Serial No. (1) in F. No. 247-NJ32], relative to the constitution of this country included at E. a decree published on July 13th, 1928, providing for the reorganisation of the Legislative Council. From announcements which have appeared in the local press since May 1932, this body would appear to have performed its functions with some industry during successive periods of two- lunar years. It is, however, more interesting* as an organ, which, in a more ordered constitution than the country at present possesses, might develop into a Council of State than as a really effective or authoritative element in the present system of government. I have not therefore troubled your department with any special reports on its activities and I should not do so now but for two features in announcements made recently. 2. The last regular session of the Council, described as the fourth, ended on March 23rd the last day of the Moslem year 1354. It was reconstituted as from March 24th by a decree issued three days earlier and published on March 28th. I have adverted in another connexion to the inclusion in the new Council of Abdur-Rauf As-Sabban, formerly one of the most active conspirators abroad against Ibn Saud. The point to which I now have to draw attention is that the decree prescribed that the new session shall last for one year. This would appear on the face of if to involve a constitutional change from the system of two year sessions. 3. What is more important is that in a speech by the King on the opening of the new session, he said that he had ordered the preparation, during the new session of the Legislative Council, of a regulation providing for an annual meeting of representatives of every district of the Kingdom at pilgrimage time, in order to strength the bonds between the people and the Government. At a later meeting the Council adopted an address to His Majesty, which has been published with a good deal of other matter relating to the Council and its past and future activities. The most interesting document is the portion of the Amir Fey sal's speech, when the address was being considered, in which he dea 1 t with the proposal for an annual national assembly. He explained that the representatives would meet for one month on the occasion of each annual pilgrimage. He justified the shortness of this period by referring to t 1 e inconvenience which would be entailed, if representatives from remote places were required to absent themselves far longer from their homes and to the inability of the Government to bear the strain of heavy expenditure. He added, however, that at the end of the month's session, a permanent body would be set up (a sort of committee of the Assembly apparently) to consider the views etc., expressed by the Assembly. 4. It remains to be seen what, if anything, will come of this project. It recalls the abortive experiment described in correspondence ending with my despatch No. 279 of July 19th, 1931. On that occasion the “National Conference' was composed of representatives of the Hejaz towns only. It was intended to be annual but the urban representatives were somewhat fractious and the Conference was never re-assembled. 5. I may mention in this connexion another speech made by the King at a banquet in Mecca on April 14th. It consisted largely of religious exhortations, but it referred to his desire for greater direct contact with his people, so that he might know their desires and that they should know of his proceedings and intentions. With this object he declared his intention of receiving any one who liked to visit him between 8 and 9 p.m. in the evening and stated that in his absence the Viceroy would receive visitors in his place at Mecca or Taif, as the case might be. If this scheme should come into practical effect, it would be in some sense an extension to the Hejaz of the traditional system in Nejd, where the King receives tribal personages and the like very freely.32 r &gt;- (49) (Received on 4th July 1936, with Political Secretary's letter No. 25, dated 18th June 1936.) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter, dated 16th June 1936. Letter from H. M. ’s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No 137 dated the 8th May 1936. With reference to my telegram No. 57 of April 30th [Serial No. (40)1 and previous correspondence relative to the relations of Italy and Saudi Arabia, I have the honour to state that on May 7th Sheykh Yusuf Yasin informed me that Lbn Sand had consented to receive my Italian colleague at Ashaira, where His Majesty has been living in camp for the last two or three weeks. The King had tried to excuse himself but had agreed to the visit after M. Persico had repeated his request four times, stressing the infrequency of His Majesty’s visits to Jedda and, finally, the danger of an unfavourable impression in Rome, if his wish were not gratified. He had explained that his sole object was to pay his respects. Sheykh Yusuf thought that this was true but promised to inform me, if anything more important came of the visit. 2. I said that I did not think that the action of the King in agreeing to receive the Italian representative would be misunderstood. It is quite ^true that the King has been very little in Jedda during the last year and that M. Persico has had no opportunity of meeting him during that period as he was absent for both the King’s visits on February 25th-26th and from March 26th to April 2nd. It is therefore, not unnatural that he should wish to make sure of seeing His Majesty before the latter proceeds to Nejd. It may be difficult for either to keep off such subjects as the training of Saudi aviators in Italy, the Italian offer of aircraft and perhaps the proceedings of the now discredited Signor Odello or to ignore completely the recent Italian successes in Abyssinia. It is indeed unlikely that my Italian colleague, who has probably acted on instructions from Rome, intends to undertake the somewhat laborious journey to Ashaira merely to say How do you do ? On the other hand I see no present reason to suspect a definite object on either side of major political importance. For one thing Sheykh Yusuf said that he himself would not go to Ashaira for the visit though a subordinate member of the staff of his Ministry would be in attendance. 3. I do not consider Sheykh Yusuf’s information important enough to telegraph, unless any further developments should appear to invest the matter with greater significance. 4.

M.’s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 146, dated 17th May 1936. In my telegram No. 63 of the 13th May (S. No. 36-A), I had the honour to submit a summary of the account given me by Sheikh Yusuf Yasin of the visit of my Italian colleague to Ibn Saud’s camp at Ashaira on the 10th May and of what passed between M. Persico and the King. I do not think it necessary to send you a full record of my conversation with Sheikh Yusuf, but I may supplement my telegram by mentioning three points of some importance which I omitted from it, as follows:— (a) My Italian colleague, according to Sheikh Yusuf, began his statement to the King by thanking him for having observed neutrality in the Italo-Abyssinian war and for not having taken part in sanctions. The King replied that he had adopted his attitude for the sake of friendship with all con- ! cerned. (b) M. Persico stressed the friendly dispositions of his Government towards the Arab nations and their readiness to give any required assurances in this respect. {c) At the end of the private conversation, in which the sheikh en gaged me after he had carried out his instructions to inform me of what had passed at Ashaira, he threw out a question regarding reports that His Majesty’s Government might with draw from the League of Nations and regarding the conse quences of such a step, if it were taken. 2 . I did not comment on (a) or (b) above. As regards (c), I took the general line that I knew of no pronouncement by any responsible person which could lend support to the reports in question; that many people, it was true, thought that the League should be reorganised to make it more useful; but that, whatever happened (and no one could foresee what would happen), it would astonish me greatly, if Great Britain abandoned or des paired of the League. 1 adduced various considerations in support of my opinion, making it clear, of course, that I was only expressing my private views as between two friends, in accordance with Sheikh Yusuf’s request. 3. Mr. Philby, who was at Ashaira during M. Persico’s visit, spent the evening at my house on the 13th May. His account of the audience, based on what he had heard from his friends, and possibly from the King himself, was generally similar to that given me by Sheikh Yusuf, though not so complete and more loosely put together. He was even more outspoken than the sheikh about the perturbation caused in the King’s mind by the outcome of the Italo-Abyssinian war. The reason for the King’s reaction was, he said, his concern for British prestige. I could not get him to say definitely why the maintenance of that prestige should interest the King so greatly, but the implications of his language were clearly these: Reliance on Great Britain was the corner-stone of Ibn Sand’s policy. Great Britain had failed to oppose a successful resistance to Italy in the case of Abyssinia and had, in fact, let that country down. How, then, could the King have confidence in the will or ability of His Majesty’s Government to resist Italian ambitions in the Red Sea? Like Sheikh Yusuf, Mr. Philby spoke particularly of the Yemen, saying that, when referring to the intended negotiations between Italy and the Yemen, my Italian colleague had spoken of a “strengthening” of the relations between the two countries. 4. Mr. Philby is as you are aware, not in the innermost secrets of Ibn Saud, and his language is very apt to be coloured by his personal sentiments. Nevertheless, I think tkat what he told me on the 13th May faithfully represents Ibn Saud’s present outlook. The King watches, as best he can, events in Europe, but he has little true comprehension of them, much less of such concepts as that of collective security or any sort of security upheld 189(8) F&amp;PDby moral force. He has little real interest in Abyssinia, and has seen in the recent conflict not so much a war between Italy and an African Power as a struggle between Italy and Great Britain. He sees in the result a sweeping victory for Italian force in this struggle. Obsessed, as he has been for years, with the fear of Italian ambitions in the Red Sea, he fears that that force may in the future be turned against the Arabian Peninsula. As a Moslem ruler still engaged in consolidating his position in Arabia and jealous of his hardly-won independence, he has no genuine love for Great Britain, a Power which block his way in various directions, e.g., in the east and south of the peninsula, but he has much less to fear from British policy on this side of it than he thinks he has to fear from that of latly. 5 . The only fortunate feature of this is that Ibn Saud probably believes that it was not so much the ability as the will to save Abyssinia that was wanting in the attitude of His Majesty’s Government as conceived by his simple mind. He probably still believes that a breach with them would be fatal to him, and hopes against hope that they would see him through in the event of a breach between him and any other European Power. He dare not go against Great Britain. He dare not offend Italy. “Neutrality” is more than ever his slogan, because, as I have said, he has seen not a war in Africa, but a conflict, not yet ended, between Great Britain and Italy. He does not yet know what its effects in Arabia may be, and it is with reference to this struggle that he clings to the slogan. (52) Enclosure in Colonial Office, covering letter dated 2nd July 1936. Letter from the Colonial Office, to the Foreign Office, No. 78125/36, DATED THE 2ND JULY 1936. I am directed by Mr. Secretary Ormsby Gore to refer to your letter No. E. 2702/56/25 of the 25th May [Enclo. to S. No. (39)], regarding Italian relations with the Yemen, and to transmit to you, to be laid before Mr. Secretary Eden, a copy of a despatch which has been addressed to the Acting Resident at Aden on this subject, dated the 2nd July 1936. 2. As regards paragraph 3 of the despatch to the Acting Resident, I am to explain that it had already been contemplated, quite independently, that Captain Seager, the Frontier Officer, should pay one of his periodical visits to Sanaa in the course of the next few months, and that Sir Bernard Reilly, before he left Aden, had informed the King of the Yemen of the projected visit. Captain Seager should have an excellent opportunity during his visit of observing any signs of increasing Italian activities in the Yemen. 3 . Copies of this letter with the enclosure thereto are being sent to the India Office, Admiralty and Air Ministry. Enclo to S. No. (52). Letter from the Colonial Office, to the Resident at Aden, dated the 2nd July 1936. I have the honour to inform you that His Majesty’s Government have had under consideration the situation created by the Italian military succes ses in Abyssinia and the possibly increasing danger of Italy embarking on some new advanture in the Yemen. 2. Although the balance of probability still seems to be against Italy attempting further acts of aggression in this area, the danger of her doing so clearly cannot be altogether excluded, and it is therefore desirable to ensure the rapid supply of any available informatoin which may have abearing on this question. I shall therefore be obliged if a special and close watch may be kept on the situation in South West Arabia and if any signs of increasing Italian activities in that region may be communicated to me by telegram with as little delay as possible. 3. It has also been suggested that a special officer might be sent to the Yemen to observe and report on any developments of this nature. This suggestion has been discussed with Sir Bernard Reilly and it is understood that Captain Seager is to pay one of his periodical visits to Sanaa as soon as Mr. Ingrams and Captain Hamilton return from leave. You will no doubt consider it desirable that Captain Seager should make this visit before he takes the leave which is due to him and that he should take the opportunity to make a special study of Italian relations with the Yemen.

It will be observed that the effect of this communique is to amend the regulations issued in 1932 in respect of Article 10 only, by the addition of sub-section 2 which provides for penalties in case of con travention of the Article. 2 . Whilst the provisions of sub-section 1 of Article 10 would appear to be unexceptionable, and I am given to understand that the practice of insistence on properly vised passports being presented before the issue of tickets has always been followed by certain shipping agents here, it would appear that the amounts of the fines provided for in the second sub-section are somewhat excessive. By “shipping company” the Saudi Government, it may be supposed, intend to mean “shipping agents 3 .

This arrangement should be communicated to all authorities concerned and published. (2) Any shipping company which may commit contravention of this Article of the instructions concerning going out to the sea, and if it becomes evident that it booked a ticket for a passenger or facilitated his embarkation to the ship belonging to it without a proper passport endorsed by the competent authority, the said company shall be punished for the first time with a fine not less than fifty pounds gold, and not more than one hundred pounds gold, and that the penalty shall be doubled in case of recidivation.' &gt;, (54) Enclosure in Colonial Office covering letter dated 9th July 1936.

In the course of a meeting yesterday Sheykh Yusuf Yasin mentioned that he had received a telegram from Ibn Saud some days before passing on a report by the Amir of Hasa, who in turn had received it from the Amir of Jubail, that about 3 p.m., on the 4th. July the sound of gun-fire (one shot I gathered) had been heard at Jubail though it was not very distinct. Two days later a similar sound was heard about half an hour before sunset, but this time it was very much nearer. , Tbn Saud had instructed him, Sheykh Yusuf said, to enquire whether there was any special reason for the gunfire, as for example were smugglers being pursued. In answer to my query, he said that there was no sugges tion that Saudi territorial waters had been entered. He merely asked whe ther there as a reason for the firing and added that the Amir of Jubail was a new man in the post. I promised that I would make enquiries, and said that from my knowledge of sloops in the Red Sea it might possibly be soipe form of gunnery or firing practice. I should be grateful if you could give me any information on this matter. I am sending copies of this letter to Rendel, Metcalfe and Hickinbo- tham.

Enclo. to S. I^o. (63). Letter from the Resident, Aden, to the Colonial Office, No. 352, dated the 22nd July 1936. I have the honour to refer to Colonial Office Secret despatch of July 2 nd, 1936 [Enclo. to S. No. (52)], regarding the possibly increasing danger ot Italy embarking on some new adventure in the Yemen and connected matter. 2 . I shall endeavour to have a closer watch kept on the situation in South-West Arabia and I shall communicate with you by telegram should I see any signs of increasing Italian activities. I have instructed Captain Seager, the Frontier Officer, to make a special study of this subject when he next visits the Yemen and in this connection I should like to draw you atten tion to certain points which have occurred to me winch are relevant to the subject under reference. 3. Our present information tends to show that any Italian activities in the Yemen, which may have underhand motives, are of a nature designed to avoid detection even to the closest observer as it is well-known that the pre sent ruling monarch would deal harshly and summarily with any foreigners oi foieign oiganisations whose activities were aimed at undermining his authority to the detriment of his State and the future inviolability of his Kingdom. There is reason, therefore, to believe that Italian methods and practices in the 'Yemen, to which His Majesty’s Government might take ex- ception in certain circumstances, are confined to subterrajiean and secret channels which amount in effect to a form of peaceful’ penetration and in filtration brought about, as far as one can judge, bv extensive bribery of the highest officials. There is, of course, an ostentatious&gt;nd superficial side to their activities and this Captain Seager will no doubt report upon in due course. Lie is now drafting a memorandum on Italian activities in the Temen which is based on the somewhat meagre information at present in our possession. This I hope to be able to forward to you shortly together with a military report on Yemeni war resources. &amp; 4. In my opinion the best way to discover secret Italian activities in the Yemen—and these may well take such root as to present a startling fait accompli in a few years’ time or following the present King’s death—is to employ more agents there. This is at present quite impossible on the pre sent monthly grant of Rs. 230 (about £17) at our disposal for Secret Ser vice. These agents would work under the Political Clerk 'in Hodeida Salih Ja’far, who has for many years, proved himself to be worthy of trust!42 5. I therefore strongly recommend that the grant for Secret Service be increased to $1,000 (about £106) a month and that sanction for the increase may be given by telegraph so that the necessary arrangements for keeping the desired special and close watch may be made ,as soon as possible. 6 . The amount of the increase required is necessarily only guess wortr but I am of opinion that half-hearted measures should not be adopted and that it is better to have too much money at one’s disposal for such an import ant purpose than too little. I should, of course, take care that all expendi ture was carefully considered and expended to the best advantage and it might be possible after a few months trial to fix on a sum somewhat less than that now asked for. 7. I enclose, for your perusal, a copy of a secret communication which I received from the Civil Administrator, Kamaran, a few days ago. This is, no doubt, Italian propaganda, but it brings out a point which I have raised in this despatch and shows even how the man in the street is acquaint ed with Italian methods in the Yemen. ^ Enclo. to S.

Seiyid Yahya Afsha a leader of Khoka arrived at Taif from Assab on 10 th instant. He reported to the Amil of Taif that he had been summoned at x\ssab (on the day of the full moon) by the Governor of Assab. Others present were other Nakhodas, Yemeni merchants and labourers. The Governor made the following statement: — “Please inform your Amils (local Governors) that the Italian Gov ernment now exercise sovereignty (sic) over all Yemeni ports from Sheikh Said to Jeizan.” The Italian Governor apparently wanted the news to spread quickly as he asked his listeners to convey the information “abroad” as soon as pos sible. Informant who seems to be genuine adds :— “We all know that it is Italian propaganda and that the statement is only given to frighten the Yemeni Government and to annoy the British Government, but we know that the Italian Gov ernment is bribing all Yemeni officials from high Ministers down to Amils the same way as they did with the local Chiefs ^ in Abyssinia.” Forwarded without comments.

I have the honour to report for your information, the death of ’Abdullah bin Husein, the Sultan of the Fadhli tribe and the election of his son Salih bin ’Abdullah as his successor, by all his relations. This election is to the best of my knowledge and belief in order, and I have therefore accorded recognition to Sultan Salih bin ’Abdullah hip Husein as the Sultan of the Fadhli tribe, and authorised the payment to him of the stipend previously enjoyed by his late father Sultan ’Abdullah bin Husein in accordance with the authority contained in Colonial Office despatch No. 22, dated 30th May, 1929. 889(S) F&amp;PD43 (65) Memorandum No. 84 (1486/236/19), dated the 14th August 1936. His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Jedda, presents his compliments to H. E. the Viceroy of India (F. and P.), Simla, and has the honour to trans mit to him a copy of the despatch to the Foreign Office, No. 246 of 14th August 1936, relating to Saudi Currency. Enclosure to Serial No. (65). Letter from the British Legation, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 246 (1484/236/19), dated the 14th August 1936. With reference to Sir Andrew Ryan’s despatch No. 95-E., of March 29th last, I have the honour to report certain further developments in the currency situation in Saudi Arabia. 2 . 500,000 new riyals arrived early in May and some appeared in cir culation almost immediately. The Government have, however, shown great caution in introducing the new currency and to this caution, accord ing to an official of the Jeddah branch of the Dutch banking concern, the Nederlandache Handels Maatschappij, mav be attributed the present comparative stability of the riyal, both in relation to the gold pound and to the Egyptian paper pound. It is also stated that the Government are resolved to maintain the present rate of 20 riyals to the gold pound, but whether this will be possible when the pilgrim season creates an added demand for local currency may well be conjectured. 3. Up to date only two new half and no new quarter riyal pieces have passed through the hands of the Legation accounting officer, although according to a notice which appeared in the newspaper “Saut-ul-Heiaz' on June 23rd, the old half and quarter pieces ceased to be legal tender on that date but could be exchanged against gold, at standard rate, if present ed at the Ministry ofTTnance within two months. The reason given for this order was the risk of confusion between the old half riyals and the new riyals, as the latter are only a little larger than the former. 4. The authorities seem to have been fairly successful in their attempt to withdraw the old’currency as two large shipments to London have been made recently through Messrs. Collatly, Hankey &amp; Co. (Sudan) Ltd. On July 29th, 250.000 and on August 5tli, 125,000 riyals were despatched bv Khedivial Mail steamer. A certain number of one riyal pieces were, I understand, included in the second shipment. 5 . I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Deoartment of Over sea Trade, Government of India (Foreign and Political Department) and Cairo.

Hodeida. 2nd to 5th June. 4. Soon after our arrival, Mr. Saleh Jaffar, M.B.E., the political clerk, accompanied by the General Officer Commanding, Hodeida; Captain of the Port and one of the Governor’s suite, called on board.5. At 0900 on 3rd June, accompanied by Mr. Burchell, Gunner, I landed, being received by the Captain of the Port; the General Officer Commanding, HodeFda,—now in plain clothes; a member of the Governor’s suite and Mr. Saleh Jaffar. A guard of Jionour with band were drawn up on the quay. After inspection of the Guard I proceeded to call on His Excellency Seiyid Abdullah A1 Wazir, My reception was most cordial, and through out our conversation, the keynote was friendliness towards Britain, and distrust of Italy, the view being freely expressed that it would be the Yemen next. The Wgjzir was most eager to hear news of events in Abyssinia and wished particularly to know if it was true that the British Legation Guard had been withdrawn from Addis Ababa. Apparently there had been a persistent rumour in the Yemen to this effect. He showed a great interest in and knowledge of the general poli tical situation in Europe, and was keen to know in what form the League of Nations—of which the Yemeni have no great opinion—could be made more effective. We parted on terms of cordial friendliness, with the Wazir expressing the desire to visit the ship on the following day should condi tions of weather and ma^il day permit. * # =* * 8 . TTnlortunatdy the Wazir was unable to come himself owing to pres sure of work arising from the fact that it wns mail day. A number of the members of his staff and other high officials were detailed to represent him. This party 'conlisted of Kazir-Ali Al-Amri, Secretary to Governor and brother of the Prime Minister; Salim Bey, the General Officer Command ing, Hoedida; Qahdi Abdullah A1 Hodaid, one of the assistants to the Governor; Muhsin Jalala, Port Officer, at one time barber to the King of the Yemen. * * * * The visit extended over one and a half hours and concluded with many compliments and expressions of friendship on both sides. * # * Mr. Saleh Jaffar was most helpful to me throughout our stay, and gave me every assistance, besides acting as interpreter during my official calls and receptipns. * # # * ( 67 ) Letter from His Majesty’s, Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 225, dated 28th July 1936. I have the honour to refer to Sir Andrew Ryan’s despatch No. 21 of the 13th January last [S. No. (22)], in which he describe the develop ments up to that date in the operations of the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate (Limited), and to submit a further brief report on the subse quent progress of this concern, in order to supplement the brief references to the subject that have been made from time to time in Jedda reports. 2. The four prospecting parties referred to in the enclosure to the despatch under reference left Jedda early in January in various directions. Little was heard of their subsequent progress, except that at the end of that month reports reached the Jedda office of the syndicate that trouble had befallen certain members of the parties. This was probably not more serious than mechanical breakdowns of their motor vehicles, but for a time45 alarmist rumours were rife locally, according to which difficulties had been encountered both at the hands of local tribesmen and of local officials. ■These were either entirely false or grossly exaggerated. Indeed, Mr. I P. Larken returned towards the end of June from Taif after a period of several months of prospecting, during which time he travelled exten sively, mainly in an area south of Taif, and reported that he had met with no interlerence. He had equally met with no success in his quest, and it was understood from him that the syndicate’s operations in the Taif area would now be definitely abandoned. 3. Much more promising results were reported from the Wejh area, where the remains of old gold mines had been discovered at a number of places in and around Umm-al-Qarriyat, some 10 or 12 miles north of Wejh. It appears as though the syndicate propose to go rapidly ahead in this new area, for they have now about a dozen of their European and American staff stationed there. These include the personnel of their own aeroplane, a Bellanca monoplane, which arrived at the end of April and is based on VVejh, whence it has several times made its appearance in Jedda. The pilot, an American, is accompanied by his wife, who acts as wireless operator, and by a mechanic. 4. Work continues at the Mahd-adh-Dhahab, or Cot of Gold. The road, of which mention is made in the despatch under reference, was completed in June and is reported to be a very serviceable affair for most season of the year over most of its length. A useful report on the major part of the road was drawn up by a member of the Legation shortly before the work was completed. Otherwise, the main interest in regard to the Mahd-adh-Dhahab centres round the problem of water. For some time drilling for water has been in progress and has been in the hands of American drillers, using American drilling machines. Progress has been slow and little or no water has been found. More recently, the Jedda manager of the syndicate relates, the London office, becoming impatient at the apparent lack of success, despatched two British drillers to this country, with British drilling machinery. The latter had just arrived when Mr. Dunckley spoke on the subject, but the two drillers had been here a week or two longer and had already considerably improved on the efforts of the Americans. Water, however, is still to seek, and the matter is apparently a serious one, for, in the words of Mr. Dunckley: “No water, no mine.” The syndicate, he added, were prepared to drill to a depth of 2,000 feet, whereas at the moment they have not gone deeper than 100 feet.. 5. I observe from Mr. Rendel’s letter of the 7th May last to Sir Andrew Ryan that a concern named the Mining Trust (Limited) now holds a controlling interest in the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate (Limited), and assume that, since the flotation of the syndicate, the component interests concerned (as given in the enclosure to Foreign Office printed despatch No. 313 of the 14th August, 1934) have changed somewhat. In this connexion, I was recently struck by a statement made by the Jedda manager of the syndicate that the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate was owned by the American Smelting Company, “lock, stock and*barrel.” 6. In Jedda work on the terminal compound has progressed very considerably, but the various premises are not yet at a stage when they can be occupied by the staff. No signs of work on a jetty are apparent, but a landing ground for the syndicate’s aeroplane has been established in the immediate vicinity of the compound. Mr. K. S. Twitchell, the general manager in Saudi Arabia of the syndicate’s operations, left on the 24th June for the United Kingdom, and his place has been taken by another American, Mr. Park. 7. I am sending a copy of this despatch to He Department of Overseas Trade and to Transjordan.46 ( 68 ) Letter from the Foreign Office, to His Majesty’s, Minister, Jedda, No. (E.-2559/271/25), dated the 7th May 1936. Lord Castle Stewart who is Chairman of the Mining Trust Limited and also a director of the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate has asked us to let you know that Mr. G. F. Lay cock, a director of the Mining Trust Limited is leaving this country on 15th May for Jedda. 2. Lord Castle Stewart tells us that Mr. Laycock, is a well-known mining engineer and Vice-President of the Terra Nova Properties Limited which operates the Buchans Mine in Newfoundland; and that the object of his visit to Saudi Arabia is to consult with the Managers of the mining properties in that country of the Mining Trust Limited which holds a controlling interest in the Saudi-Arabian Mining Syndicate. 3. I understand that Mr. Laycock will be arriving in Jedda towards the end of May and he would be grateful for any assistance that you could properly give him. (69) Letter from the Petroleum Department (Mines Department), Dean Stanley Street, Millbank, London, S. W. 1 , to the Colonial Office, No. P. D. -236/16, dated the 18th July, 1936. Reverting to my letter of the 6th May and your reply of the 29th May, No. 78026/36, about the attitude to be adopted to the proposal of Petroleum Concessions Limited to apply for an oil concession in the Yemen, I think you will be interested to see the attached copy of an official letter from the Admiralty to the Foreign Office, which probably you have not seen, regard ing a similar attempt which has been made oy the Company to obtain an oil concession from the Saudi Arabian Government over the Western coastal areas in the Red Sea. You will see that the Admiralty attach importance to preventing Italian interests from entering into competition for this concession. I should explain that at a comparatively late stage in the negotiations the Italian Minister at Jedda intervened to request the Saudi Arabian Govern ment to defer the grant of a concession until Italian interests had had time to come forward. In this connection the Saudi Minister of Finance enquired about the standing of Petroleum Concessions Limited, vis-a-vis H. M. Government, and was informed by H. M. Representative that H. M. Government fully support the Company. We have just heard that the Company have secured the concession. I think the above has a rather important bearing on the question of the line to be adopted in regard to the Company’s project in the Yemen. When the Italians find they have failed in Saudi Arabia it is possible they may try elsewhere in this neighbourhood and I would be glad if you could consider again the possibility of doing something in the Yemen to support the only substantial British interest which is available. In view of the terms of your letter of the 13th May to Reilly he will hardly feel that he ought to go out of his way to help. What I suggest is that Reilly might now be told that we are anxious to see Petroleum Concessions Limited get the concession they are seeking ancT ask him to consider whether anything can be done to assist. I am sending copy of this letter to Rendel. ^ 889(S) F&amp;PD47 ^Letter from the Admiralty to the Foreign Office, No. M.-03230/36, dated the 2nd July, 1936. .With reference to your printed letter No. E.-3797/1283/25 of the 25th June, and subsequent telegraphic correspondence from H. M. Representa tive at Jedda, concerning the Saudi Arabian Red Sea Oil Concession, I am commanded by My Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to acquaint you, for the information of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, that they attach importance to preventing Italian interests from entering into competition for this concession. Copies of this letter have been sent to the India Office, Petroleum Department and Department of Overseas Trade. Letter from the Colonial Office, to the Foreign Office, No. 78026/, 36, dated the 22nd August 1936. I understand that you received a copy of Starling’s letter to me of the 18th July on the subject of the application of Petroleum Concessions Limited for an oil concession in the Yemen. There are obvious difficulties in affording any active support to the company; and before I discuss the matter with Reilly I should be glad to know what line you wouldTlike us to take. Letter from the Foreign Office to the Colonial Office, No. {E.-4590/, 260/91), dated the 28th August 1936. Will you please refer to Starling’s letter No. 236/16 of 18th July, to you and connected correspondence about the attitude to be adopted to the proposal of Petroleum Concessions Limited to apply for an oil concession in the Yemen. 2. We have been recently reconsidering the attitude to be adopted towards Petroleum Concessions Limited in their quest for oil concessions in the Red Sea area in the light of growing evidence of Italian designs and aims in that region. As a result we are wondering whether as regards the Yemen our attitude towards Petroleum Concessions Limited may not perhaps have been hitherto a little too rigid, particularly as when they were seeking a concession in Saudi Arabia we went so far as to assure the Saudi Arabian Government that His Majesty’s Government fully supported them. We cannot of course identify ourselves with any parti cular company to the prejudice of other British or quasi-British concerns or press the Imam to grant a concession to any particular company. Nor can we well take part in the actual negotiations for the concession. Further more, the absence of direct diplomatic representation in the Yemen makes it difficult to extend to the Company the ordinary facilities which we should extend, in a normal country, to a British Company which had our confidence. At the same time there may well be ways and means by which the Resident at Aden could indirectly facilitate the company’s task; and it is clearly in the interests of His Majesty’s Government that Petroleum Concessions Limited which, although an international concern, ss nominally a British Company with an important British element, should obtain any concession which the Government of the Yemen may be willing to grant, rather than that such a concession should go to the Italians. Moreover we are inclined to doubt whether the appointment of Major Holmes as the Company’s mouthpiece in the Yemen should be allowed to affect the attitude of His Majesty’s Government towards the Company’s activities for it must be remembered that he is being given every facility by the Persian Gulf Authorities in his search for concessions in Bahrain and on the Trucial Coast.48 3. In these circumstances we fully concur in the terms of Starling’s letter referred to above and hope that the Colonial Office may find it possible to inform Sir B. Reilly that His Majesty’s Government would like to see Petroleum Concessions Limited get the concession in preference to any Italian concern and that within the limitations described above he should therefore facilitate the company’s task in any way he properly can. It could of course be pointed out to Sir B. Reilly that it would not be proper for him to take any direct part in the negotiations or to urge the grant of a concession to the Company. 4 . Since this letter was drafted I have received your letter No. 78026/ 36 of 22nd August to Rendel (who is on leave) asking for our views on this subject, which I think are clearly set forth above. 5. I am sending a copy of this letter to Starling. Letter from Petroleum Concessions Limited, City-Gate House,' Pinabury Square, London, E. C.-2, to the Under Secretary of State for the Colonies, Colonial Office, Whitehall, S. W.-l, No. P. C.-41/92, DATED THE 3RD SEPTEMBER 1936. In continuation of our letter of March 23rd, 1936, upon which your letter No. 78026/36, dated April 23rd, furnished certain comments, we have now to report that, as suggested in our letter, Major Holmes has addressed His Majesty the Imam, offering his services in the direction of exploring the oil resources of the Yemen, and asking for an audience. He received a reply from the Imam about a month ago, a translation of which is passed to you herewith. Major Holmes has, owing to preoccupations in the Persian Gulf, not been able to visit Aden as he had hoped. His letter to the Imam was, however, communicated through the Chief Commissioner. The Company has not, at the moment, developed any further plans for approaching the Government of the Yemen, but should it do so we will communicate them to you in due course. Translation cf a letter from the Imam of the Yemen to Major Holmes, DATED THE 2ND DAY OF RaBI AL THANI, 1355. In the name of Allah, the Compassionate, the Merciful; to his Honour, the respected Major Holmes. We have been glad to receive your letter dated the 29th May, 1936, which was submitted to us through the respected Government of Aden, and we thank you for your sincerity and love shown towards the Arab people, and, in particular, we are greatly pleased by the success of your under- * » taking in a country which is a brother of our Kingdom, according to what we have learnt from the details given in your letter; and be sure that I share in the gratitude of my brothers, the principality and people of Bahrain, for your services there. As regards your wish to visit our f k Kingdom and initiate scientific enquiries there also, we hasten to tell you that this desire increases our gratitude towards you; but, as no doubt you became aware on your former visit, the particular internal conditions of our country are not favourable to investigations in a general way, though they would secure the pursuance of your scientific enquiries in certain suitable areas. We take this opportunity of expressing our appreciation of your efforts., With all respects, (Imam’s Seal)-49 Letter from the Colonial Office to the General Secretary, Petro leum Concessions, Limited, No. 78026/36, dated 25th September 1936. I am directed by Mr. Secretary Ormsby Gore to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. P. C.-41/92, of the 3rd September from which he notes that, as a result of the reply received from the King of the Yemen, it is not proposed for the present to address the King further on the subject of an oil concession. (70) Letter from the British Legation, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 252, dated the 24th August 1936. With reference to Sir Andrew Ryan’s, despatch No. 57 of the 28th February last, in which he reported the presentation by Monsieur Maigret of his letters of credence as Minister Resident to King Abdul Aziz, I have the honour to inform you that on the 14th August my French colleague presented fresh letters of credence to the Amir Feysal, in his capacity as Viceroy of the Hejaz, this time as Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary. 2. The event was briefly recorded in the “Umm-al-Qura” of the 21st August, but no details as to whether Monsieur Maigret delivered a speech, were given. 3. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s High Com missioner for Egypt, Cairo, and to His Majesty’s Chief Commissioner, Aden.

Letter from the British Legation, Gulhek, to the Foreign Office, No. 410 (604/4/36), dated the 27th August 1936. With reference to Mr. Bateman’s despatch No. 417, of the August, I have the honour to inform you that the visit of feeyed Muhammed Zubara, Minister of Court of the Yemen, has been given considerable prominence in the Persian press. 2. In an interview published in the “Journal de Teheran of the 21st August, Seyed Muhammed Zubara, after suitably flattering reference to the progress of Iran and to the personality of the bhah and tne Valiahad, by both of whom he has received, went on to refer to the histori cal friendship between Iran and the Yemen, He said that he hoped tha this friendship would shortly be further strengthened by the visits ot Yemeni Princes, possibly of sons of the Imam, and that he thought rt 1 1 e y that Yemen student would soon be sent to study at the University of Tehran. He added that this extension of relations^ between the Yemen and Iran necessitated the creation of a Yemeni Diplomatic Mission i Tehran and the appointment of an Iranian representative to banaa. 3 Whether Seyed Muhammed Zubara’s statements are of any impor - ance remains to be seen. In any case, Monsieur Motamedy now Head of the Near Eastern Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, recently informed a member of my staff that the present vtsit was of - Pohtmal importance, and this is borne out by the fact that, thou S Affairs given to the distinguished visitor by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Monsieur Motamedy, who was on holiday within easy reach of Tehran cHd not bother to return to the capital to attend it. Monsieur Motamedy thought that Seved Muhammed Zubara’s visit was lareelv ^ b e expl^ned by the fact that he was a Shiah, and he has in fact now left Tehran to make a pilgrimage to Meshed. s50 1 . ^ 4. According to the “Journal de Teheran”, Seyed Muhammad Zubara will return to his country by way of Iraq, Syria and Egypt. 5. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Baghdad No. 65, and to the Resident at Aden, No. 604/4/36.

It now transpires that Salih Hasan is not a British protected person and he should not be regarded as such. 3. The enclosures are returned herewith. Extract of a letter dated 4th March, 1936, from the Saqladi Sheikh i of Sahib to the Political Secretary, Aden. In reply to your letter No. 576, dated 25th January, wherein you informed us that the Colonial Office at London informed you that an Arab whose name and description (shewn therein) has submitted an application for a certificate of nationality and identity, the name is Saleh Hasan, we inform you, oh friend, that we have enquired about the said person but could not find any trace about him at Shaib. The place and date of birth is Qariat A1 Husein. May we point out to you that A1 Husein is known to you as one of the towns of the Amir hence we cannot interfere in this matter and it is for the Amir to institute enquiries for his sons and country. The photograph is sent herewith. .Greetings. Letter from the Political Secretary, Aden Residency, to the Amir of Dhala, No. 5553, dated the 28th July, 1936. Oh friend, we refer you to your letter dated 16th December 1935, in which you informed us that Salih Hasan was not one of your subjects but that he belonged to the outskirts of ‘Mureis’, which is in the Yemen. 2. From a further communication received from the Colonial Office, London, we noticed that the applicant—Salih Hasan was in possession of a certificate of nationality and identity issued to him by the India Office, London on the 9th May, 1928, on our recommendation m which his place and date of birth is given as “Qariat El Husein”, Dhala, December 1895. •In this connection we invite attention to your letter dated 23rd January,1928, a copy of which is enclosed, in which you informed us that the appli cant was one of your subjects who lived in El Husein village in Dhala and requested us to grant him a passport. 3. In the circumstances we shall be obliged if you will be good enough to cause further enquiries to be made and let us know whether Salih Hasan is the same- man referred to in your letter dated 23rd January, 1928, and is one of your subjects. We enclose his old certificate and a new photograph for purposes of identification, and request that they may be returned with your reply as early as possible. Greetings. Letter from the Amir of Dhala, to the Political Secretary, dated 1st August 1936. We have received your letter No. 5553, dated 28th July, 1936, regard ing Salih Hasan who alleges to be one of our subjects, and in reply we inform you, oh friend, that he has sent us a letter in the year of 1346 (1927) from the sea and therein he mentioned that he is one of our subjects and so we believed his statement and made no enquiries. When your last letter was received we made enquiries and we could not find any trace of his people, section or sub-section. He does not belong to Qariat A1 Husein and there is no truth in his statement. We cannot write you lies. In his previous letter he gave us false information but it has now been ascertained after enquiry that he is not one of our subjects. Greetings.. (75) Foreign Office, Memo. No. (E.-6028/1283/25), dated the 23rd Septem ber 1936. Saudi-Arabian Red Sea Oil concession. Major Longrigg, of Petroleum Concessions Limited (the I. P. C.) called on me yesterday morning for a general talk about his recent negotia tions with the Saudi Government. Beyond giving me a good deal of the local background— e.g., the friendly reception he had received at Taif, the agreeableness of the climate of Taif, the general manner in which the negotiations were conducted, some sidelights on the personalities con cerned, and rather a gruesome account of M. Biraud’s last illness—Major Longrigg did not tell me much that we did not already know. 2. He produced the attached sketch map of the concession, but agreed that it did not go much further than the text, since in the north and south the concession is bounded by the northern* and southern frontiers of Saudi Arabia, while inland it is bounded generally by a line running 100 miles from the coast; but the precise method of interpreting that definition or drawing the line has been left over for subsequent discussion if and when oil is found in the neighbourhood of the boundary. The sketch map throws no light on this point. 3. Major Longrigg, said that the Company intended to do its best to develop the concession, since the payments to the Saudi Government were steeply graded, and it would not pay the Company merely to put the concession into cold storage. He agreed that oil experts were often un reliable and mistaken, but he thought that there was a distinct probability of oil being found, particularly in the southern area. The Saudis had apparently been anxious that the Company should take on the Wadi Sirhan as well, but the Company had come to the conclusion that the prospects of oil were too remote in that area to justify them in extending the concession to include it. Up to Mudawara.53 4. Major Longrigg impressed me more favourably than I had expected. It seems also that he speaks Arabic fluently and carried on his negotiations exclusively in that language. He said however that he thought that his Company had been enormously helped in their negotia tions by the efforts and intrigues of the Italians, of which Ibn Saud was profoundly suspicious, so that, as the Italian intrigues increased, he had become the more ready to let the concession go to a British concern. 5. Major Longrigg then turned to the question of the Yemen, on which 1 am dictating a separate note. (76) Telegram from His Majesty’s. Minister, Jedda, No. 114, dated the 8th October 1936.

His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda presents his compliments to Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, Simla, and has the honour to transmit to him a copy of telegram to the Political Resident, Bushire, No. 30 of 8th October 1936 [same as Serial No. (76)] relating to the movements of Ibn Saud. [Same as S. No. (77)], (80) Letter from the British Embassy. Rome, to the Foreign Office, No. 211/2/36, dated the 16th September 1936. Your letter of the 7th September (E.-5523/2617/91), on the subject of Italian designs on the Yemen. You have no doubt by now seen our despatch No. 950 (203/1/36) of the 29th August [S. No. (81)] on this subject. There is really not a great deal which we can add to the information contained in that despatch. At various times since the conclusion of the Italo-Yemenite Treaty in 1926, there have been rumours that Italy was casting an acquisitive eye on the Yemen, but at the same time and up till last year, the Italian authorities showed a desire to allay these suspicions as far as possible. We ought not, however, to forget the speech which Signor Mussolini made to.the Quinquennial Fascist Assembly in 1934. In this speech, to which we drew your special attention in our despatch No. 950, and which formed the subject of the Embassy’s despatch No. 245 (189/2/34) of the 19th March, 1934, he said that “Italy’s historical objectives have twx) names: Asia and Africa. South and east are the cardinal points which should stimulate the interest and determination of Italians. Northwards there is little or nothing to be done; nor is there more to be done westwards, neither in Europe nor beyond the ocean. These objectives of ours have their justification in geography and in history. Of all the great western Powers of Europe the nearest to Africa and to Asia is Italy. A few hours by sea, fewer still by air, suffice to join Italy to Africa and Asia. Let no one misunderstand the scope of this secular task which I assign to this and future Italian generations. It is not a matter of territorial con quests, and let this be understood by all near and far alike, but of a natural expansion which should lead to collaboration between Italy and the peoples of Africa, between Italy and the nations of the Near and Middle East.” As an assurance of peaceful intentions Signor Mussolini’s declaration has of course proved valueless in the event, but it is perhaps of some interest as an open indication, if one were needed, of Italian aspirations in the Near and Middle East. There can be no real doubt that Italy desires to increase her influence in that part of the world and there is every reason to suppose that she would be glad enough to establish a footing on the Arabian coast of the Red Sea if a favourable opportunity offered. All this, however, does not mean that Signor Mussolini has already prepared plans for an early advance against the Yemen. On the contrary we believe that while there are no doubt not a few Italians—and some of them perhaps in high places—who are casting covetous glances at the Arabian shores of the Red Sea, no serious authority contemplates any F&amp;PD55 iorward action in that area for the moment. Italy has trouble enough on her hands, particularly in the economic and financial spheres, and of course Abyssinia has still to be digested; indeed, the greater part of that country has not yet even been swallowed. Italy’s foreign policy is essentially opportunist and I therefore hesi tate to venture any prophecy as to future trends. 'My own personal view is that Italy will quietly but determinedly make a drive during the next few years at undermining our influence in the Arab and Moslem world; so we must be prepared for intrigue of every sort. But I doubt whether they will “strike” just yet. They are more likely to concentrate on prepar ing the ground, perhaps in the hope that they may eventually be able to get what they want without having to “strike” at all. ( 81 ) Letter from the British Embassy, Rome, to the Foreign Office, No. 950, dated the 29th August 1936. I have the honour to inform you that, according to a recent Stefani communique, the Treaty of Friendship and Commerce between Italy and the Yemen dated the 2nd September, 1926, the text of which was enclosed in Mr. (now Sir Charles) Wingfield’s despatch from this Embassy, No. 846 of the 4th October, 1926, has been extended until November 1937 by an exchange of notes between the two Governments. I shall not fail to supply you with the text of these notes as soon as they are published in the Official [Gazette. 2. The extension of this treaty has been the occasion of considerable comment in the press here. An article in the Popolo di Roma recalls that the important points established by the treaty were the declaration by the Government of the Yemen of their willingness to import technical material from Italy and to admit Italian experts into the country to assist in its economic development, and the declaration by the Italian Government of their willingness to grant facilities in this sense. When the treaty was concluded (continues the writer of the article) a number of Arab journals expressed the fear that Italy was planning to turn the Yemen into a zone of exclusive Italian influence and that the provisions of the treaty were not compatible with the full independence of that country. The ten years which have lapsed since the treaty was signed have been sufficient to explode this myth. Not only does the agreement not impinge in any way on the liberty of action of the Yemen Government, who are not obliged by it to accept Italian materials or experts against their wishes and whose liberty to purchase in whatever market they wish is expressly reserved, but Italy’s policy since the signature has given rise to no suspicions that she has ^ any other designs in the country than those compatible with true friend- ' ship. 3. In an article in the Messaggero it is stated that the prolongation of the treaty corresponds with the plans of the Italian Government for the development and maintenance of peaceful relations' with the countries on the eastern coast of the Red Sea, where there exists a long tradition of commercial exchange and affinity of custom and religion with Ethiopia. Italy is determined, says the writer of this article, through relations of “bon-voisinage” maintained with these States, to contribute by all the means in her power to their progress and civilisation. She has no designs on their independence or their autonomy. This policy “is an aspect of the Italian Empire which will assume more and more importance as time goes on and which fits in perfectly with the programme of relations between Italy and the Orient* on which the Duce insisted in two memorable speeches.” The speeches to which reference is here made appear to be those which he pronounced at the opening of the Congress of Asiatic Students in December 1933, a summary of which was enclosed in Sir EricC6 Drummond’s despatch No. 990 of the 22nd December of that year, and his discourse before the second Quinquennial Fascist Assembly (a translation of this speech was enclosed by his Excellency in his despatch No. 245 of the 19th March, 1934). I venture to draw your particular attention to the portions of this speech in which Signor Mussolini touches on the role that Italy was designed by history and geography to play in Asia and Africa. Kecent events give his words a peculiar significance. 4. Thus it will be seen that the renewal of the treaty between Italy and the Yemen has been made the occasion for a number of inspired articles illustrating the role of patron and friend which Italy aspires to play and which she believes she has already begun to play in the Near East. Colla boration with the Arab races, as the Giornale d’Italia observes, is to be developed to the mutual advantage of both parties. The conquest of Ethiopia, it is said, has been a great step in this direction, for opposite the Arab littoral now lies, not the amorphous dynasty of Abyssinia, but the Italian Empire with its harbours and roadsteads open to the exchange both of goods and of ideas. Nevertheless Italy does not, it is maintained, cherish designs on the liberty of the Arab States. On the contrary, their independence and their friendship are cardinal points in her policy. 5. These comments are doubtless designed to impress foreign (and in particular Arabian) as much as Italian opinion with the value of friend ship with the newly-founded Italian Empire and with the innocuousness of Itaian policy so far as the eastern shores of the Red Sea are concerned. Time alone can show the extent to which these professions will be trans lated into practice. 6 . I have sent a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s representative at Jedda. Copy. (E.-5052/4552/25). ' ” ; * i Enclosure in Foreign Office. Covering letter dated 16th October 1936. Lord Castle Stewart called upon me by appointment on August 5th bringing with him Mr. K. S. Twitchell the American who is managino- the affairs of the Saudi-Arabian Mining Syndicate Limited. I had under” stood that Mr. Twitchell had certain definite information which he wanted an opportunity of giving us but when the interview started it appeared that he was simply prepared to answer any question which I liked to ask him about general conditions in Saudi-Arabia. We had a certain amount of desultory conversation about the progress which the Mining Syndicate was making but, beyond the fact that the Syndicate found all the Saudi- Arabian authorities well disposed, with the possible exception of Yusuf Tasin, and that, apart from a regrettable tendency on the part of the local population to put boulders in the paths of motor cars, thev had no particular difficulties, nothing much emerged. The Syndicate are apparently well satisfied with their progress and hope the mining will prove vahiable It soon became apparent that what Lord Castle Stewart and Mr. I witched really wanted to talk about was Italian influence &gt;*n Saudi-Arabia. They were both rather disturbed by the efforts which the Italian Minister was making to impress the Saudi Government and by. the possible consequences of the recent gift of aeroplanes, from the Italian Government to the Saudi .Government. Mr. Twitchell volunteered the opmmn that the Saudis were deeply suspicious of the Italians and were not likely to lacihtate the task of Italian penetration but he evidently thought that in practice it might be difficult to resist such penetration In his view the Lmted States and Great Britain were the only countries whom ie ^audis were likely to trust. The United States though quite intersted57 in the operation of American companies in Saudi-Arabia were not likely to take any active steps and he for his part would like to see His Maiesty’s Government increasing their own influence in Saudi-Arabia. Both he and Lord C astle Stewart agreed that it probably would not do to give any appearance of running after the Saudis and they disclaimed any suggestion that His Majesty’s Government should enter into competition with the Italians and the French in presenting aeroplanes to the Saudis. What they were really afraid of I think was that the Italians might at some future stage try to get hold of the landing grounds which the Saudi- Arabian Mining Syndicate is making for its own use within its concession area. They suggested that it would be well worth while for His Majesty’s Government to consider whether the Saudis could not be attracted to this country more by an offer of facilities for training air pilots in the United Kingdom. I said that I thought there might be difficulties about this as His Majesty’s Government’s own hands were pretty full at present with air force expansion. However, I said that we would certainly consider whether anything on the lines suggested w T as feasible. Lord Castle Stewart said that the company had met with a certain amount of difficulty from the health point of view. A number of their employees had suffered from undefined illnesses and one or two had died. The company were therefore taking steps to engage the services of an expert from the London School of Tropical Medicine to make a special study which would last for some months. They would propose to present the results of this study to the Saudi Government and it occurred to Lord Castle Stewart that one way of extending our influence would be in the field of medicine in Saudi Arabia. He seemed to have some idea of estab lishing a permanent medical adviser to the company who would also give the benefit of his advice to the Saudi authorities. I said that the idea of communicating to the Saudi Government the results of any expert investi gation which the company might undertake seemed to me a useful one. As to the establishment of any permanent medical advisers I advised Lord Castle Stewart to keep in the closest touch with His Majesty’s Legation at Jedda in view of the difficulties which the Saudis seemed in clined to place in the way of foreign practitioners at the moment. I advised him to look very closely into the regulations which had recently been issued in regard to medical practitioners and foreign dispensaries and to make quite sure of keeping within the law of such regulations. (Signed) J. C. STERNDALE BENNETT. The 10th August 1936. f Letter from the British Legation, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 267, dated 12th September 1936. ^ I have the honour to refer to your printed despatch No. 215 of the 20 th August transmitting the record of Mr. Sterndale-Bennett’s interview with Lord Castle Stewart and Mr. K. S. Twitchell of the 5th August, and in accordance with your instructinons to furnish my observations on the various questions touched on during the conversation. 2 . It is interesting to observe that the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate's London officials were apparently well-satisfied with the pro gress made so far in this country and that they had hitherto encountered no serious difficulties. The claim that the prospects at Wejh are en couraging is made here with some confidence, but as regards the Mahd- ad-l)hahab I have for some time derived the impression from certain members of the Syndicate’s personnel that the future of these workings depends entirely on whether an adequate water supply can be assured. That the London Board regard the question as one of great importance would appear from the fa^ that since I reported on this subject in my despatch No. 225 of the 28th July last [S. No. (67)], they have sent out.at this somewhat unpleasant season of the year ? two water specialists of different qualifications, one a Swedish geo-physicist (at a salary of £300 a month) and the other a British waterdiviner. The latter has now left Mahd. This, if true (for it is as yet unconfirmed), might well dissipate dreams of an Eldorado in that particular area. opinion that the Saudis were deeply suspicious of the Italians is of con siderable interest. For my own part, I am impressed by the volume and unanimity of reports current in Jedda that the Italian Legation here is au mieux with the Saudi authorities, as I have reported in my despatch No. 259 of the 5th September, but I am unable to dismiss from my mind the impression created by Sheykh Yusuf Yasin, only two months ago, vdien he spoke to me, with a sincerity 1 found difficult to question, of his Government’s resolve not to grant the oil concession for the Farsan Islands to the Italians 1 The Saudi Government at that time resisted the pressure that was brought to bear on them here by the Italian Minister, a resistance which might well have caused them some embarrassment as they had not long before accepted at the hands of the Italians, the gift of three aeroplanes. Perhaps the fact that, as far as I am aware, the remaining three aeroplanes have not yet arrived, may be attributed to Italian dis appointment over the oil concession. I therefore am inclined to share Mr. Twitchell’s opinion. I would certainly agree with the view that it would be impolitic to enter into any competition with the Italians for the favours of King Abdul Aziz, either in the supply of aeroplanes gratis or in the training of Saudi pilots. 4. It is somewhat difficult to express an opinion on the fears of the Syndicate that Italians might at some future stage attempt to get hold of their landing-grounds. These, I understand, are now fairly numerous and have been established at Jedda, Mahd-ad-Dhahab, Wejh, Yanbu, Dhiba and Taif, by special arrangement with the Saudi Government from whom they are leased. It does not appear that at Jedda, at least, there is any such menace, for the Saudi authorities, with, it, is believed, Italian advice, are now engaged in laying out a large landing ground north-east of Jedda, in the vicinity of the Government’s Kandara villa, which, reports say, is also to be brought into use for the pilots and other personnel. If it is true, as reported in Jedda Report for June, paragraph 207, that the establishment of a chain of landing-grounds across Saudi Arabia is in contemplation (and in this connection it will be recollected that last year Ibn Saud was reported to be considering a postal service by air across his kingdom, upon the return of his pilots from Italy), this would not seem to threaten the Syndicate’s landing grounds in such centres as Wejh, Yanbu and Dhiba. Their ground at Taif, moreover, is distinct from that of the Government at that place. 5 . The foreign personnel of the Syndicate have had an unfortunate record of ill-health since the commencement of operations. I am reporting , . , * i xt* nn a j-'U ~ 1 Ann t'U 3. As regard Italian influence in Saudi Arabia, Mr. Twitchell’s59 6 . I rally agree with the suggestion to present the results of any such investigation to the Saudi Government, although I fear that the present Director-General of Public Health would regard himself as too conversant with the conditions in this country to pay much attention to outside advice. I also agree with Mr. Sterndale-Bennett’s cautionary suggestion that the Syndicate should look very closely into Saudi regulations before committing themselves to maintaining a permanent medical staff here. 'But I feel that the idea is to be recommended, both from the Syndicate’s own point of view, and for the more general reasons mentioned by Lord Castle Steward and ,Mr. Twitchell. The Italians, again, are reported to have in view the establishment of ai^ up-to-date dispensary here and the Italian Legation doctor, who is now away in laly, is credited with the intention of bringing staff and material back to Jedda with him. Here, however, there would be less of the element of competition as between a commercial company and a Legation, than there would be in the case of the gift of aeroplanes. Moreover, there would be less opposition, I believe, on the part of the Saudi authorities to a non-Government dispensary or medical institution of the sort than to those conducted in this country under the auspices of foreign governments. There would, too, be no question of their operations extending to Mecca. I should, therefore, on the whole be favourably disposed towards a proposal of this nature, viz., the establish ment of a permanent medical staff here, more particularly ae Jedda is badly off in its resources for medical treatment at present, and may be even more so before long, with Petroleum Concessions Ltd. bringing a new influx of Euroeans to this country. (83) Letter from the British Legation, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 260, dated 7th September 1936. With reference to my despatch No. 200 of the 7th July last, relative to the claim of the Imperial Bank of Iran against the al-Fadhl firm, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a translation of an announce ment which appeared in the Mecca “Umm-al-Qura” of the 4th September, on this subject. It will be observed that it corresponds closely to what was foreshadowed by Sheykh Yusuf Yasin in conversation with me in June last. I am taking steps to inform the Imperial Bank of Iran of the publica tion of this notice by the earliest mail. 2 . f am sending a copy of this despatch and its enclosure to His Majesty’s Trade Commissioner, Bombay. TRANSLATION. Extract from the “Umm-al-Qura”, No. 613 of 4th September 1936. Announcement. In view of the fact that the guardianship of Sheykh Abdulla Mohammad-al-Fadhl over the minors of the late Saleh-al-Fadhl and over one third of his estate has been proved, and, as the said guardian has claimed that the properties under sequestration at Jedda known as “Muntazah” and “Huseynieh” were not the property of the firm of Ibrahim-al-Fadhl who is under seizure but of the minors who have no connection with the firm of al Fadhl, the Government have handed over the said properties to the said guardian. He who has any claim or right thereof should approach the Sharia Court at Jedda with a view to proving his claim in course of one year to begin from the date of the first announce ment published in “Umm-al-Qura”. Any claim after the expiry of the said year shall be refused and not attended to. This is published for the information of all concerned.• » 60 (84) Letter from the British Legation, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 259, dated 5th September 1936. I have the honour to report that, during the past few days, the Italian Legation, through its cavasses, has been engaged in distributing broadcast through the town of Jeddai copies of two Arabic newspapers, the Barid Barqah, published at Benghazi, and Al adl of Tripoli. That the distribution has been lavish would appear from the fact that my Indian vice-consul obtained six copies of each without any apparent difficulty. Apart from a totally incorrect report of 7,000 British casualties on the North-West Frontier of India (a report also broadcast recently from the Italian wireless station at Bari, causing some concern for a time amongst Indians resident here), the contents of these newspapers do not appear to be open to serious objection, their principal features being items of news of the progress of the Italian subjugation of Ethiopia; the reproduc tion of an article from the Egyptian Kowab-ash-Sharq on Italian Islamic policy, and referring in particular to the announcement by the Italian authorities that the Arabic language would be used in the courts of law at Harrar; and a number of photographs of Islamic institutions in Italian North Africa. 2. The dissemination in this way of Italian news, of a propagandist nature, is further proof of the interest now manifested by that country in Arabian affa?irs, an interest which my Italian colleague was said to have stressed, in referring to the friendly dispositions of his Government towards Arab nations, during his audience with Ibn Saud on the 10th May last, reported by Sir Andrew Ryan in his confidential despatch No. 146 of the 17th May. 3. Brief reference was made in Jedda report for August (paragraphs 263 and 286) Jo the unusual crop of rumours to which the visit of Amir Feisal to Jedda on the 14th August gave rise. In all of these the Italians figured prominently, and in a favourable light. Three more aeroplanes were to arrive here, it was said, during the Amir’s visit; they were to be brought by an Italian man-of-war; and a high Italian personage was to accompany them presumably to hand over to the Saudi Arab Government, though some reports went so far as to state that he was to supersede Signor Persico (who has remained here this summer) as Italian Minister. These rumours, of course, died a natural death, but the impression in Jedda is, I think, general that the Italians are, for the present at least, on the most cordial terms with the Saudi authorities. Incidentally, the original Italian offer of aeroplanes was of six machines, of which' three only, so far as is known, have been delivered. Three more, therefore, may be said to be overdue, and rumour is again busy, at the time of writing, prophesying their imminent arrival. 4. I am sending copies of this despatch to Cairo, Addis Ababa and Aden. (85) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter No. E.6857/1418/93, dated November 11th, 1936. Letter from the British Embassy. Bagdad, to the Foreign Office. No. 518, dated 21st October 1936. With reference to my despatch No. 115 of February 29th last, I have the honour to inform you that a further party of five Yamani students arrived in Bagdad a few days ago to enter the Royal Medical College. Thus the total number of Yamani students in Iraq is now brought up°to thirty. ^61 , | The students came under the charge of Qadhi Abdullah-Al-Sarhi and fcaiyid Yahiya A1 Nahan, who, according to popular rumours, have been charged with the task of arranging with the Iraqi Govt, for the establishment of a Yamani Consulate in Bagdad. Nuri Pasha tells me however, that these gentlemen have not been given any official duties other than the care of the students under their charge. i recen t talk with the Oriental Secretary, the Sa’udi Charge re betra y ed a marked suspicion of the frequent visits of semi official 1 amani visitors to Iraq and evidently feared that the Iraqi Gov ernment, by encouraging such visits, were trespassing in what he regarded as the exclusive sphere of influence of King Abdul Aziz A1 Sa’ud. ° 4. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda and to the Political Resident at Aden. ( 86 ) Telegram from the British Legation, Jedda, to the Foreign Office No. 120, dated 8th November 1936. My telegram No. 118 of October 25th, supplemented by despatch sent by bag October 28th. A three-engined Italian aeroplane arrived from Rome, November 4th apparently as present to Saudi Arabian Government. I understand that it is an out-of-date Caproni and that two more are to follow bringing total to six originally promised. ° 2. I cannot believe that Yusif Yasin’s proposal was sincere. (87) Letter from the British Legation, Jedda, to the Foreign Office No. 295, dated 27th October 1936. In my telegram No. 118, dated October 25th, I reported that Sheykh ’Vnsuf lasm had inquired privately whether His Majesty’s Government would be prepared to receive and to assist missions of young Saudis whom the Saudi Government wished to be trained in aviation. I now transmit a translation of his personal letter and a copy of my reply. 2. The history of aviation in Saudi Arabia is well known to you. My predecessor reported on the subject in detail in his despatch No. 176 dated June 8th. The present position, so far as my information goes is this. Of the six Italian aeroplanes (make unknown) which it was believed were being presented to the Saudi Government by the Italian Government only three have arrived, and of these only one has been seen in the air at one time for some weeks past and two are stated to have received some slight damage. I have no information as -to the use to which the machine presented by the French Government is being put. The old British machines (Wapitis) have not been used at all since the Italian aeroplanes arrived. The young Saudis who were sent to Italy for training seem to have returned nominally qualified to act as pilots, but little is known about their performance as Saudi “eagles”. So faa* as my information goes no Saudis have been trained as air mechanics, and this essential part of the functions of aviation is discharged by foreigners, viz. three White Russian refugees, and two Italians, wffio with an Italian' pilot- instructor, were sent with the Italian aeroplanes. 3. I was at first inclined to see objections to taking action on a private letter from Sheykh Yusuf Yasin. but I now see an advantage in this course since if the request cannot be encouraged by His Majesty’s Government, as I imagine it cannot, it can be rejected more easily than if it had been put forward officially.4. I have thought of many reasons as having perhaps prompted •Sheykh Yusuf’s letter, though I hesitate to give greater weight to one rather than to another. Sheykh Yusuf is inclined to embark on little schemes of his own in the hope, probably, of making some small coup and winning credit thereby. Then the Italian experiment has come to the end of the first stage and it may be that the Italians are either reluctant to continue because of the poor quality of the students, or will not go on with it unless they receive some proof of Saudi friendship which Ibn Baud is reluctant to supply. (In this connection I may mention that the “Saut-ul-Hejaz” of October 20th, published for the first time pieces of Italian propaganda taken from one of the Arabic newspapers distributed in Jedda by the Italian Legation). Or it may be that the relative success attained by the Iraq Air Force under British tuition has attracted Saudi attention: indeed, the commandant of the Saudi forces at Jedda recently praised the Iraq Air Force very highly in conversation with a member of the staff of the Legation . Or perhaps Sheykh Yusuf is courting a refusal so that we may be stopped from criticising Italian penetration in Saudi military affairs, 5. Whatever the motives behind the request, I do not suppose that it will appeal to His Majesty’s Government. It is unlikely that Saudi Arabia could produce five, still less ten to fifteen, young men every year who would make competent air pilots. It is possible that a few young men of good Nejdi origin could be found who, if they were put through a long, complete course, would make creditable pilots, but I much doubt whether Saudi Arabia will be able for many years to come to provide men for a considerable air force, particularly the mechamics and other skilled artisans who would be required. I fear that the Saudi authorities are inclined to regard an airforce as chiefly a matter of pilots, aoid aeroplanes as being rather like gramophones whose handles anyone can be taught to turn. 6 . I notice that in the conversation wdiich the Air Officer Commanding, Middle East had with Fuad Bey Hamza on the 23rd April (reported in a despatch to the Air Ministry of which a copy was sent to Jedda in Foreign Office despatch No. 130, dated the 14th May), he suggested that the Saudi Government should send some young men to England or Egypt to be trained as mechanics. If any Saudis are to be trained for aviation under the auspices of His Majesty’s Government, I suggest that it would be better that the training should take place in Egypt or Iraq, if this is possible, both because it would be cheaper for the Saudis and in particular because the students could not object if required to reach standards attained by other Moslems. But I doubt whether any arrangement that could be concluded would be satisfactory. The Saudis would expect His Majesty’s Government not only to teach their young men for nothing but probably to keep them too, and if they agreed to pay for them the pay ments would always be in arrears and this Legation would have to dun the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Nor is it likely that the students when trained would do great credit to His Majesty’s Government and any gratitude which we might w T in bv agreeing to assist m the training of Saudi airmen would be dissipated if the returning “eagles” failed—even if entirely through lack of skilled machanics—to give satisfaction to Ibn Baud. 7 Since this despatch was drafted I have received a copy of the desoatch No. 1072, addressed to the Foreign Office by His Majesty’s Chargd d’Affaires at Rome on September 30th ; in which it is reported that accoi^ing to the “Vie dell’Aria” arrangements have been made to send fifty more students to Italy from the Hejaz for training in aviation. This inclines me towards the last hypothesis set forth in paragraph 4 above. Ibn Saud may be committed, however unwillingly, to the arrangement by which Saudi airmen are to be trained in Italy and may wish to protect himself against possible criticism on our part,by making a proposal which, if accepted at all, could only be accepted on such financial terms as he 889(S) F&amp;PD03 could reasonably say were too onerous for his slender budget. But if I knew my suspicion to be well founded I should still hesitate to recommend a sc erne which in the long ru^i would not I fear give satisfaction to either party. G 8.1 am sending copies of this despatch and its enclosures to the 1Je J? ar * ment of Overseas Trade, Rome, Cairo, Bagdad, Jerusalem, Bushire Letter from Sheykh Yusuf Yasin, Saud-i-Arab Kingdom, to Sir H. W. Bullard, British Legation, Jedda, dated 18 th October 1936 . I am glad to write to you this letter directly after I have had the honour of seeing His Majesty my Lord the King at Hail on my return from Jedda. I am also glad to convey to you an expression of His . s pleasure for hearing of the friendly conversations between us in the affairs we discussed and which I submitted to His Majesty. I am sorry my stay in Jedda was short and was not prolonged to _ enable me to speak to you of matters which we hoped may help for the ^ promotion of the co-operation and collaboration between this country and your friendly country. After my arrival my Government have begun to contemplate sending missions for education to be trained in aviation abroad, so I found it better to write to you this private letter asking for your assistance in approaching the British Government with a view to finding out whether they would agree to accept training such missions in their schools. The Mission which will be sent shall not exceed ten to fifteen persons a year and it will be annually year after year. I therefore shall be glad if you will be good enough to enquire about the necessarv terms and the help which the students may expect to get from the British Government in their training and the yearly expenses for each person. The purpose of such missions is to learn civil,and military aviation. I shall be grateful to Your Excellency if you would be good enough to furnish me with this information in the earliest possible convenience. Letter prom Sir R. W. Bullard, British Legation, Jedda, to Sheykh Yusuf Yasin. T hasten to reply to your letter of 2nd Sha’bai (October 18th) which reached me yesterday and to express my thanks for the kind message from His Majesty the King which had the honour to receive by that means. I am reporting to His Majesty’s Government by telegraph your private suggestion about the training of Saudi students in aviation in England, and will communicate their reply to you as soon as it is received. I hope that there is no need to assure you with what sympathy His Majesty’s Government must regard the desire of the Saudi Arab Government ^to secure technical training for their young men so that they may take part m the development and defence of their country. Nevertheless I feel that I ought to remind you that at the present moment His Majesty’s Govern ment are engaged in the reorganisation and wide extension of the British Air Force, and that according to my personal information, this task occupies the time and energies of the aviation authorities fully that they might find it difficult to provide for Saudi students the facilities which the training of pilots and aircraftmen requires. This training is a long and expensive business and I know that my Government would not wish to undertake it unless they felt that they could secure results that would do credit to both parties. In this letter, however, I am speaking privately just as you were in your letter. Hope to be able to write to you more definitely on the subject very soon.Letter from the Foreign Office, to the Air Ministry, No. E.-7173/, 90/25, dated 1st December 1936. With reference to Foreign Office letter No. E.-6711/90/25 of 28th October enclosing, for the observations of the Air Council, a copy of tele gram No. 118 of October 25th from His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda regarding the desire of the Saudi Arabian Government to send a certain number of Saudi subjects to this country for training in civil and military aviation, I am directed by Mr. Secretary Eden to transmit to you the accompanying copy of a despatch which he has now received from Sir Header Bullard on this subject.- 2. Mr. Eden appreciate the arguments advanced by Sir Reader Bullard againstySheikh Yusuf Yasin’s proposal, but he considers that the vase for giving it sympathetic consideration is nevertheless a strong one. it may well be that the ordinary rather backward Arab from Saudi Arabia is unlikely to make a first class pilot. But the Iraqis have been able to produce a reasonably efficient air force under British guidance in a com paratively short space of time, and both Arabs and Egyptians have shown reasonable capacity to become good motor mechanics. In these circum stances the possibility of training Saudi Arabs to become adequate air pilots and mechanics should in Mr. Eden’s opinion not be ruled out except after full consideration. 3. Moreover, if His Majesty’s Government stand aside in this question and refuse to give the Saudi Arabian Government any assistance in res ponse to the present proposal a clear field will be left for other countries, who are prepared to incur considerable expenditure with a view to estab lishing their position and prestige in the Arabian Peninsula. Were His Majesty’s Govt, to adopt a policy which might be regarded as driving the Saudi Arabs into the hands of the Italians, for example, Italy might eventually obtain a privileged position in air matters in Arabia and thereby secure facilities for the establishment of an air route under Italian control from the Red Sea to the Persian Gulf or from Egypt through Arabia to the Yemen. The Italians are extremely anxious to establish air bases on the Arabian coast of the Red Sea and in Arabia itself, and anything tending to make aviation in Arabia more exclusively dependent on Italy than it already is would go far to facilitate this object. Mr. Eden hopes that full weight will be given to this consideration. 4. Mr. Eden is aware that the Saudi Arabian Government do not dispose of sufficient funds to be able to pay large sums for the training of their pilots, and that cases have occurred in the past where great diffi culty has been experienced in collecting money due from the Saudi Arabian Government to His Majesty’s Government. But the repent grant by the Saudi Government of oil and mining concessions in Saudi Arabia has fur nished them with somewhat greater resources than they disposed of in the past, and, if they are indeed anxious to develop their aviation, they may be prepared to ear mark part of the resources now available for this particular purpose. In any case it is for consideration whether the political and air issues involved may not be of sufficient importance to justify a contribution by His Majesty’s Government for the purpose of facilitating compliance with the present Saudi Arabian proposals. 5. In Mr. Eden’s opinion, if the training of Saudi Arabian pilots in this country should on grounds of expense or for any other reason prove impossible, the suggestion mentioned in paragraph 6 of Sir Reader Bullard’s despatch, that Saudi pilots might be trained under British suspices in Egypt or Iraq, is worthy of full examination. 6. I am to request that Mr. Eden may be furnished with the views of the Air Council on the whole question at an early date. 7. Copies of this letter are being sent to the Treasury and India Office.Enclosures in Foreign Office covering letter dated December 9, 1931, No. E.-7172/5404/91. Letter from the British Legation, Jedda to the Foreign Office, No. 289, dated the 25th October 1936. I am now able to inform you that Mr. Philby, on whose movements I reported in my despatch No. 271, dated 22nd September, has reached Najran on the return journey and is expected to arrive in Jedda in about three weeks from now. 2. I have studied very carefully the despatch from Aden to the Colonial Office No.^92 Secret, dated 30th September, of which the Acting Resident has se'nt me a copy. Having known Mr. Philby for many years I should not be surprised if his comments on the question of the frontier between Saudi Arabia and the Aden Protectorate had been such as to give good ground for the reports enclosed in the abovementioned despatch, since in articles which he has written for magazines and newspapers he has openly urged that His Majesty’s Government should confine to the narrowest pos sible lunits their claims on behalf of the various rulers round the coasts of Arabia. I share the opinion that Colonel Lake appears to hold, that Mr. Philby was speaking as a private person. Sir Andrew Ryan received more than one proof that Mr. Philby was not in the inner councils of Ibn Saud, and it may be that Mr. Philby does not know that Ibn Baud’s extreme claims on the southern frontier, as put forward during the recent discus sions, do not include “all the tribes between Najran and the Hadhramaut”, still less any tribes or areas within the Hadhramaut. I cannot believe that Ibn Baud, while in the middle of negotiations on this point, would even desire still less authorise Mr. Philby to make the wild statements that are now attributed to him. If the Qatar affair is mentioned as an argument on the other side, I would point out that Ibn Saud from the beginning advanced claims in respect of Qatar such as he has never put forward during the discussions about the south-western frontier. Had I had the opportu nity I should have spoken of Mr. Philby’s activities to some representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but the nearest, of any importance, is at Hail. I do not wish to deal with the case in writing, if it can be avoid ed, as that would enhance Mr. Philby’s importance, to his great satisfac tion, and would be more apt than in conversation to give the Saudi Arab Government the impression that we believed him to be acting under their instructions or at least with their connivance. I have usually found Arabs quick to diagnose Mr. Philby as obstinately wrong-headed, and if I see Fuad Hamza or Yusuf Yasin it should be easy to refer to his wild state ments in the Hadhramaut as obviously irresponsible though nevertheless liable to create a regrettable impression on people under British protection and to mar the good relations between Saudi Arabia and His Majesty’s Government, and to elicit a repudiation. I have no doubt that Mr. Philby will express his views freely when I see him on his reurn, and what he says may serve as a guide to action. It is unfortunate that his return journey is taking so long, and that the responsible Saudi officials are scattered over the Near East, but I think that to delay is better than to take up the question in writing before I l\ave seen either Mr. Philby or some Saudi official with whom the matter can be discussed in a friendlv manner. In coming to this conclusion I have not overlooked the fact that Mr. Philby must have travelled with a considerable escort presumably provided by the Saudi authorities, and that his talk of establishing a motor road gives his journey something of an official character. 3 . If you wish a written protest to be made in any case you will doubt less give me instructions by telegraph. And anyhow, if I remain cut off from personal contact with the Saudi Foreign Affairs officials for a consi^ derable time longer, I may be forced to take up the matter in writing unless general considerations seem to be strongly against that course.V 66 1 4. While this despatch was being drafted, Mr. Calvert had a conversa tion, recorded in a minute of which a copy is attached, with the engineer, Mr. Fearns, who assembles in Jedda the Ford cars imported by Mr. Philby’s company, Sharqieh Ltd. The statements made by Mr. Fearns, who is an honest, straightforward man, tend to show that the main object of Mr. Philby’s journey was archaeological research, though as Mr. Calvert points out, this does not explain Mr. Philby’s activities further south. Mr. Philby would he capable of using any occasion to engage in log-rolling on behalf of the ruler to whom he has paid many rather sycophantic tributes in his writings on Saudi Arabia. 5. I am sending a copy of this despatch and its enclosure to Aden. Minute. M inister. I called on Mr. Fearns last night. He informed me that Mr. Philby was still in Najran (he appeared to think it a place rather than a province, and could give no clearer indication of Mr. Philby’s exact whereabouts)! From this I gathered that he had heard again from Mr. Philby and that the later had halted for the time being. Mr. Fearns went on to say that he thought Mr. Philby’s stay in Najran (and possibly the whole trip through to the Hadhramaut) was not unconnected with the search for ancient re mains. It appears that during the Saudi-Yemen war, Amir Saud, who was operating in Najran, discovered certian vestiges of early settlements. He later sent a party of men to Najran to excavate and these discovered the hpad of a Hom in bronze, complete with one fore-paw. This was sent to Mr. Philby and Mr. Fearns himself packed it up and sent it to London. Mr. learns expressed the opinion that it was a good piece of work, and it was certainly an excellent piece of casting. It was this discovery, according to Mr. Fearns, that whetted Mr Philby’s appetite for a trip south. The above may have some element of truth, but of course does not ex plain satisfactorily Mr. Philby’s activities further south. Dated 25th October 1936. . ^ (89) (E.7344/2617/91). Ibn Saud and Italian Ambitions in Arabia. Ihe Saudi Minister came to see me this evening and brought a verv long confidential despatch in Arabic which he had just received from King Ibn Saud. M. Zada gave me the substance of the despatch as follows But he seemed to find unusual difficulty in translating it and in making the points in it clear. 2 As His Majesty’s Government would have observed, Ibn Saud had recently been consulting them more and more frequently on questions of f ? r A lgn P 0l i 1C} \ T. hls was because (1) he considered that the true interests of Arabia lay m friendship with Great Britain, (2) because he wanted to a P° ic y as possible with that of His Majesty’s Government and (3) because he wished to do nothing which might cause His Maiestv’s Government embarrassment. But he appreciated that the questions which he asked them from time to time might also be embarrassing to them and he wished to know first of all whether His Majesty’s Government welcomed this attitude on his part, or would prefer that he did not consult them so often. j despatch went on in this strain for some time, and then explain ed that Ibn Saud was, very uneasy about the situation in various parts of Arabia, and in particular in the Yemen and in Iraq. Much propaganda was being carried on against His Majesty’s Government, who were being 880(S) f&amp;pd - &amp;67 represented as the enemies of the Arabs, who were being incited to adopt a hostile attitude towards them in consequence. This propaganda had been carried on by the agents of four Powers in particular, viz., Italy, the Soviet Union, Germany and Turkey. 4. On my cross-questioning the Minister as to precisely what all this meant, it turned out that what it all boiled down to was that Ibn Saud was very uneasy about Italian propaganda in Arabia in general and about Italian intentions in the Yemen in particular. Ibn Saud explained that Italian agents were being particularly active in the Yemen, where they were, by bribes and propaganda, undermining the influence of the Imam. This might lead to the fall of the Imam, or in any case to the development of an extremely dangerous situation if the Imam should for any reason dis appear. Ibn Saud was anxious, if possible, to come to some understanding with His Majesty’s Government about the situation. 5. I waited until the whole of this document had been explained before replying. I then began by repeating, what I had often said before, that His Majesty’s Government fully appreciated and reciprocated Ibn Saud’s friendly feelings towards them, and appreciated in particular the way in which he wished to avoid any conflict of policy with them and from time to time consulted them on political questions with this object in view. There was certainly no reason why Ibn Saud should not continue to keep in touch with His Majesty’s Government on questions of policy, and His Majesty’s Government would always be glad to answer any questions he might ask them, whenever it was possible for them to do so. 6 . As regards anti-British propaganda, the four countries which Ibn Saud had named as being responsible for it were in rather different cate gories. I was surprised to hear the Turks mentioned, as our relations with Turkey had recently been particularly friendly. At this the Minister explained that Ibn Saud was no doubt thinking of the past. I said that if this was so, it was no good raking it up, but that I found it rather difficult to believe that the Turks were really carrying on any anti-British propa ganda now. As regards Germany, she was of course keenly trying to deve lop and expand her commerce in the Middle East; while Soviet Russia was, by the nature of things, bound to carry on propaganda everywhere in favour of her political ideas; but it would be useful to know whether Ibn Saud had any special cases in mind. Iji reply to this, the Minister admitted that the only propaganda about which Ibn Sand was seriously worried was that of Italy. He did not seem inclined to follow up any of the other sugges tions, which may have been mere window-dressing. 7. I said that it was of course well-known that Italy had been carrying on a great deal of active propaganda all through the Middle East. We were well aware that this had often been violently anti-British— e.g., the broadcasts from Bari, etc., which were well known. Moreover it was clear that a good deal of Italian money had at one time or another been spent in such propaganda activities. In so far as they might be carried on in Saudi Arabia itself, only King Ibn Saud himself could deal with them. As regards such activities elsewhere, it would be useful to know whether Ibn Saud could give us any further details, and whether he had any definite suggestions to make. 8 . The Minister replied that Ibn Saud had no definite proposals, but merely wished to bring the facts to our attention, particularly with regard to Italian intrigues in the Yemen. As regards Italian intrigues in Saudi Arabia, he would be very grateful for any information we could give him. I said that this might be difficult, since one might know that propoganda was going on and money being spent, when it was nevertheless not possible to quote chapter and yerse. With regard to Ibn Saud’s suggestion that we should reach some understanding with Ibn Saud with regard to possible Italian activities in the Yemen, I explained that the position was that His Majesty’s Government desired to see Saudi Arabia strong and independent, and to see the independence of the Yemen equally maintained. This prin- ciple underlay the Anglo-Italian Understanding of 1927, the substance ofwhich had already been communciated to Ibn Sand, by which Great Britain and Italy recognised their mutual interest in seeing the independence of the Arab kingdoms maintained, and mutually renounced any intention of establishing themselves on the Arabian coast of the Red Sea. Italy was thus bound by an understanding with His Majesty’s Government not to establish herself in the Yemen, and she would hardly be likely to violate that understanding unless as part of some major dispute, which would turn not on local Arabian but on major European political issues. What ever one might thing of the value of Italian promises—regarding which one might well be sceptical—there could clearly be no question of His Majesty's Government reaching an understanding with Ibn Sand which would be based on the assumption that a friendly European Power was about to vio late and undertaking which it had assumed towards this country. 9 . The Minister, after some conversation in Arabic with M. Zada, replied that Ibn Saud did not mean an understanding of this kind, but that be merely wished His Majesty’s Government to know that they could rely on him to support them in the event of Italy attempting any adventure in the Yemen in violation of her undertakings. I said that I would record what the Minister had said and submit it for consideration, but l made it clear that, while we fully appreciated Ibn Baud’s attitude towards us and the dangers of the situation in the Yemen, we could not proceed on any assumption that Italy would disregard the Rome Understanding. 10. The Minister then reverted to the question of Italian propaganda in Iraq, but admitted that King Ibn Saud had nothing to go on and was merely puzzled and disturbed by what had recently happened in £hat country. 11 . The upshot of a long and somewhat confusing conversation~seemed to be that Ibn Saud wished for some kind of assurance that we did not regard him as a nuisance; wished to warn us of Italian activities in the Yemen and of the danger threatening from that quarter, which would be greater to him even than to us; and seemed to hope to obtain from us some kind of undertaking to join with him in resisting any Italian attack on the Yemen, a suggestion which the Minister abandoned as soon as I indicated some of the obvious objections to it. (Signed) G. W. RENDER, 23rd November, 1936. ! r 1 (90) Letter from the Colonel Office to the Foreign Office, No 79086/36, dated 7th December 1936. With further reference to your letter (E. 1133/205/25) of the 7th of May on the subject of the Hejaz Railway, I now enclose a copy of a despatch dated 12th May 1936 from the High Commissioner containing his observations on the conclusions reached by the Haifa conference, considera tion of which in the Colonial Office has had to be postponed on account of many more urgent preoccupations. With regard to the crucial question of the method of financing the reconstruction of the line from Ma’an to Medina, the High Commissioner points out that the Palestine, Syria and Trans-Jordan sections are all running at a loss, and there is tiierefore no money out of which those sec tions of the line could finance the repair of the Saudi section. There are, of course, resasons for regarding the line as a single unit, but in the absence of any profit from the sections of the line in Trans-Jordan, Syria and Palestine, there is little likelihood of getting any contribution from any of those territories. There are no funds belonging to the Railway out of which contributions could be made, and the only way, therefore, in which a contribution could be obtained would be if the Governments concerned69 would piovide some money out of general revenues. Since there is a consi derable loss on the Palestine and Trans-Jordan sections, those Govern ments could reasonably say that they have already done their share in res pect of the Railway by keeping the line open in their own territories and incurring a loss in so doing. There seems to be little likelihood of either Palestine, Syria or Trans-Jordan contributing anything towards the scheme, save that Trans-Jordan might undertake some responsibility in respect of the small section in its own territory, if the whole scheme were adopted. It seems to be equally unlikely that the Saudi Government will find the money at the present time. There appears to be no chance that the line will be a paying proposition, and one can hardly see the Saudi Gov ernment, which is notoriously short of money, providing £150,000 on which they would get no return. The unattractive commercial possibilities in turn seem to make it most unlikely that any private syndicate would undertake the work. It therefore appears that the only possible way of raising the money is that His Majesty’s Government should provide it. They certainly could not justifiably provide it on the grounds of the scheme’s commercial attrac- ^ tions, but it is conceivable that it might be possible to justify the expendi ture on political grounds. The Railway was destroyed during the Great War and it might be argued that, having regard to the history of its destruction and to its general interest to the Moslem world, and as a gesture to the Moslem world, His Majesty’s Government should undertake to repair it. Such a gesture might have considerable advantages at the present time. It would show the Arabs that we are very much interested in their welfare and it might be a means of counteracting the spread of Italian influence in that area. It may finally be worth consideration, whether the Railway could be regarded as of possible strategic value to His Majesty’s Government. In the event of a war with Italy, if Saudi Arabia threw in their lot with us, it might conceivably be a link in an alternative route to the Suez Canal. Do you think in the circumstances that there is a case on general political grounds for His Majesty’s Government undertaking to pay the cost of re pairing the Railway? If you think that there is a case, the next step would presumably be to bring the Treasury into consultation on the matter. If, on the other hand, you consider that there is no case, it is probably a waste of time to pursue the matter further as it seems extremely unlikely that any other source will assist to a sufficient extent to enable the money to be raised. The Railway has remained derelict for the last fifteen years without causing any great disturbance in the Moslem world and presumably it can remain derelict for a further period without any un toward results. As time goes on, the need for the Railway will probably become steadily less, since pilgrims will tend to go to Mecca more and more by motor routes. ^ Copies of this letter and the enclosure are being sent to the War Office, Air Ministry, India Office, and Treasury. Letter from the High Commissioner for Palestine to the Colonial Office, No. T. C./69/35, dated 12th May 1936. 1 have the honour to refer to your Confidential despatch of the lOtfi d anuary, 1936, regarding the conference held at Haifa in October, 1935, on the subject of the reconditioning of the Hejaz Railway. 2 Of the conclusions reached by the conference on the five points which formed the agenda, I have no comment to make on Nos. 1, 2, 4, and 5, save to endorse the recommendations of the conference. 3. As regards the third point, namely the manner in which the expenses necessary for the reconditioning of the line are to be met, I would observe that I am unable to endorse the recommendation of the Saudi re presentative, Fuad Bey Hamza, that the reconditioning of the damagedsections should be effected at the expense of the line as a whole. Apart from the political aspect arising out of the question of the ownership of the sections of the railway in different territories, there is the practical consideration that both the Palestine—Trans-Jordan section and the sec tion in Syria have no surplus funds whatsoever, while heavy expenditure for renewals will soon become necessary. The Gene ral Manager, Palestine Railways, informs me that if 7,000 pilgrims, each paying £P.12 for ia return ticket, were carried annually by the railway the costs of the restored line might just be covered and provision made for some maintenance, but there would be no margin for renewals. I think, however, that the estimate of 7,000 pilgrims put forward by the Saudi delegates is much exaggerated, for only relatively few pilgrims, from Syria, Iraq, Palestine and Trans-Jordan, with a few in transit from India, pass by this route. Consequently I can not suppose that His Majesty’s Government, or indeed any other source, would be willing to provide a sum of nearly £P. 200,000 for the repair of a line which could be expected to earn so inadequate a return. And if restoration of the railway has any value commercially it is almost exclu sively as a means to develop the northern Hejaz and to revive Medina, and to that extent any financial liability should rest entirely on the Saudi Government. 4 . I need hardly say that I should be very glad if an agreed means could be found for the provision of the required capital. Apart from the incidental benefits which might be expected to accrue to Palestine and Trans-Jordan, as explained in my despatch Confidential B of the 14th June, 1934, I think that an agreement leading to the restoration of the line would favourably affect the political relations between His Majesty’s Govern ment and King Ibn Saud. But His Majesty’s Government are better able than I to judge what weight should be given to this consideration. (91) Letter from the Colonial Office, to the Resident at Aden, dated 7th December 1936. I have the honour to refer to Lieutenant-Colonel Lake’s despatch Iso. 426 of the 2nd of September on the subject of the ownership by foreigners of immovable property in the Yemen, and to inform you that I have been in consultation with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs on the matter. 2. Under the Treaty of Sana’a, on which the treaty relations of His Maiestv’s Government with the Government of the Yemen are based, Hia Alaiestv’s Government have recognised the complete and absolute indepen dence of the King of the Yemen, who consequently is free to enact any internal legislation he may wish. There is nothing in that Treaty to pre vent him from imposing restrictive legislation on British subjects in the matter of their ownership of real property in his country, provided all foreigners are treated in the same way. . 3 1 am unaware of the legal position of foreigners in the Yemen in the matter of the ownership of such property prior to the notification from the Kintr of the Yemen to the Governor of Hodeida enclosed m the despatch under reference. I am advised, however, that it would be contrary to international law that British subjects and protected persons should suffer neruniarv loss by reason of the application of a law compelling them to Cnose of real properties which they have acquired with the permission o t with the toleration of the Government at that time exercising authority 4 In this case, therefore, I am of the opinion that British subjects and British protected persons ought not to be compelled to sell their immovable B if such nronertv has been lawfully acquired, but in any case if sales are enforced the arrangements made with regard to them should such as wouW enable the owners to obtain thq proper value of their 830iS) F&amp;FD71 property. A postponement of the operation of the Order or at any rate a provision that there should be a reasonable period for its operation, so as to avoid the simultaneous forced sale of a number of properties might be one way of attaining this end. I would refer you in this connection to Foreign Office despatch No. 153 of the 2ffth of May, 1935, to His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda, a copy of which was sent to you in Colonial Office confidential despatch of the 26th of June, 1935, on the subject of the Saudi regulations covering the ownership by foreigners of real property in the Hejaz. 5. With regard to the suggestion in paragraph 4 of Lieutenant-Colonel Lake’s despatch of a hint of reciprocal measures in Aden, I am advised that a hint of this nature would in effect be an empty threat, as His Majesty’s Government would be precluded from implementing it by virtue of paragraph 5 of the Treaty of Sana’a, which accords the principle of most-favoured-nation treatment to subjects of the Yemen. 6. I observe from the Political Intelligence Summaries that the opera tion of the decree is for the present being withheld, but you will no doubt be glad to have the foregoing comments for your future guidance. (92) Letter from the British Embassy, Bagdad, to the Foreign Office, No. 89, dated the 17th February 1936. With reference to my despatch No. 66 of February 6th, on the subject of the negotiations now being carried on in Bagdad for the conclusion of a treaty of alliance between Iraq and Saudi Arabia, I have the honour to inform you that I learn from Mr. Edmonds, the Adviser to the Ministry of the Interior, that within the last few days Shaikh Yusuf Yasin has raised with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs the three following questions :— (1) The delimitation of the Iraqi-Saudi Arabia frontier. (2) The abolition of the neutral zone at Tawal. (3) The conclusion of a new extradition agreement between the two countries &lt; 2. None of these questions appears to involve any important British interest except possibly that of the delimitation of the frontier. I under stand from Mr. Edmonds that it is possible that the Iraqi and Saudi Governments will agree, that if inaccuracies are discovered in the geogra phical coordinates given to any wells, hills or other places mentioned in the frontier described in the first protocol of Uqair, the delimitation com mission which the Saudi Government have suggested should be appointed, shall be guided in their work by the actual places rather than by the co ordinates assigned to them. A notable example is the Jabal Anaza. On the War Office map of 1/1,000,000, dated 1917-18, this, as you know, is shown on the intersection of latitude 32 north with longitude 39 east, whereas the latest surveys place it about 15 miles to the north-east of ds point. t . 3. If therefore, the frontier between Iraq and Saudi Arabia is made end at * the Jabal Anaza and not at the intersection of the lines latitude and longitude mentioned above, some adjustment oi e frontier between Transjordan and Saudi Arabia laid down in the adda agreement will presumably become necessary. This latter line is “scribed as starting “from the point of intersection of meridian 39 L idi narallel 32” N’’ and, unless it is altered, a considerable gap will be It between the end of tee Iraqi and tee beginning of tee Transjordan on tier lines. , , . , 4. Other misatkes, which, as you are aware, have latterly been aetected i the 1/1 000 000 map, such as the position given to Judaidat alArar id Mukur, would, Mr. Edmonds tells me, give rise to little trouble, asthe bedouin tribes of this part of the country have naturally observed as the frontier the place named in the Uquair agreement and have no under standing of the inaccuracies of the map on which it was originally worked out ? 5. The Saudi proposal regarding the Neutral Zone is that it should be abolished by establishing a frontier line drawn straight from the junction of the Wadi al Aujah with the Batin, to Bir Ausab. This proposal is being examined by the Iraqi Government, hue as at present the only im portant feature of this territory is the watering places used by the bedouin tribes of Nejd and Iraq, it does not appear that His Majesty’s Govern ment need be concerned as to the manner in which it is dealt with by the two limitrophe governments. 6 . As regards extradition, Mr. Edmonds tells me that he understands that the Saudi Arab Government are asking for an agreement considerably w T ider in scope than that signed at Mecca in April 1931. 7. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda and to His Majesty’s Consul-General at Beirut. Letter from the Foreign Office, to H. M.’s Ambassador, Bagdad, No. E. 981/52/25, dated the 11th March 1936. \ou may like to have a private word of explanation about our attitude towards the question of the frontier between Saudi Arabia and Iraq, as developed in your official despatch No. 89 (17/25/36) of the 17th February. 2 . I should explain in the first place that we have long been familiar with the discrepancy between the true position of the summit of the Jebel Anaiza as now surveyed on the ground and the geographical description of it— i.e., the approximate intersection of latitude 32 North with longitude 39 East— given in the Protocol of Uqair—a geographical description which is repro duced by itself in the Hadda Agreement. In our view there is no doubt what ever that the true summit of the Jebel Anaiza as now surveyed must be regard ed as the terminal point of the frontier, since the geographical co-ordinates are quoted in the protocol of Uqair merely as a supplementary or explanatory, and not as a substantive, definition. Indeed they are only mentioned as giving the approximate position. 3 . The point is of considerable importance to us in connexion with the sector of the Transj ordan-Saudi frontier laid down in the Hadda Agree ment. The negotiators of that Agreement plotted the frontier on the 1918 edition of the one in a million War Office international map, and, as so plotted and shown on that map, the frontier is a more or less reasonable one. It now turns out however that the physical features are in fact wrongly shown on that map in relation to the geographical coordinates, with°the result that if the frontier were plotted on the ground or on a revised map purely in the light of the geographical coordinates quoted in the Hadda Agreement for purposes of definition, a new and most un satisfactory frontier in relation to the physical features would result. We are satisfied here that the Hadda frontier should follow as closely as possible the line drawn on the 1918 map in relation to the physical features as shown on that map, and that the geographical coordinates quoted in the Hadda Agreement should therefore be disregarded where they do not correspond to that line. Our strongest legal argument in support of this view, however, is The fact that the North-Eastern terminal of the Transjordan-Saudi frontier must correspond with the North-Western terminal of the Iraqis Saudi frontier, and therefore, in view of the phraseology of the Protocol of IJqair which defines the latter terminal, that it must lie at the true summit of the Jebel Anaiza and not at the purely geographical point men tioned in the Hadda Agreement. Once this point is established the rest of the frontier will follow.73 4. All this of course is rather outside your immediate sphere, but I thought it might be useful to you to know that the establishment of the North Western terminal of the Saudi-Iraqi frontier at the true summit of the Jebel Anaiza and not at the geographical point mentioned as a supplementary definition in the Protocol of Uqair will be very definitely to our advantage, and very helpful to us in our negotiations with the Saudi Government about the Transjordan frontier. 5. As regards the neutral zone, the matter seems to be entirely one for the Saudis and Iraqis to settle between themselves, but our experience here, generally speaking, has been that neutral zones are an unmitigated nuisance, and that if they could be got rid of the situation is likely to be considerably simplified. They have in particular given us a great deal of trouble in connexion with recent negotiations for oil concessions in Arabia. 6 . As regards extradition I was under the impression that the settle ment arrived at in Mecca in April, 1931, had been found to offer a very satisfactory solution of existing difficulties. I am not sure whether we are called upon to advise further in regard to it, but the Treaty Depart ment generally have rather strong views on extradition questions, and if you are in any doubt therefore you may like to send us a separate despatch on the point. Letter from the British Embassy, Baghdad, to the Foreign Office, No. 17/27/36, dated the 20th February 1936. With reference to my despatch No. 89 of February 17th, about the Iraqi Government’s negotiations with Saudi Araoia, I enclose a copy of a note prepared by Edmonds for his minister on tne Iraqi—Saudi Arabia boundary and the neutral zone. In his covering letter Edmonds writes that he thinks that the Saudi proposals for the bisection of the neutral zone and the demarcation of the frontiers are not likely to be pressed, but that importance is attached by the Saudi delegation to the Dahamshah dispute and to the amendment of the extradition agreement. Both of these are hardy annuals carefully cul tivated by Ibn Saud. They are, however, solely the concern of the Iraqi and Saudi Governments and I need not bother you with details. I learn from Yassin Pasha that the revival of these stale and antiquated differences has rather overcast the dawn of a new Arabian brotherhood which some optimists saw on the horizon and, in consequence, the treaty of alliance is being extensively redrafted. I gather that Yassin has done some plain speaking to Yusuf Yasin and has told him franklv that Saudi Arabia clearly cannot help Iraq effectively in any circumstances until she becomes more civilised and that, on the other hand, he must not imagine that Iraq will allow herself to be drawn willy- ^ niily into any complications m which King Abdul Aziz may become involved with states either members or non-members of the League. Yusuf Yasin apparently asked wfiat Iraq would do if Saudi Arabia were to go to war with Great Britain; Yassin just told him not to be silly. SAUDI IRAQ NEGOTIATIONS : NOTE NO. 4. The Boundary. ) 1 . Shaikh Yusuf A1 Yasin has proposed : {a) that the Neutral Zone shall be divided between the two States; (b) that the boundary shall be demarcated. 2. The relevant article in the Treaty of Muhammara reads as follows :— According to Article 1 (a) the Muntafiq, Dhafir and Amarat tribes belong to Iraq, similarly the Shammar Nejd belong to Nejd. The wells and lands used from 014 times by the Iraq tribesshall belong to Iraq and the wells and lands used from o]d time by the Shammar Nejd shall belong to Nejd. In order to determine the location of these lands and wells and to fix a boundary line in accordance with this principle, a committee shall be formed consisting of two persons and presided over bv a British official selected by the High Commissioner; the committee will meet in Baghdad to fix the final boundaries, and both parties will accept these boundaries without any objec tion. 3 . The “Committee” provided for duly met at Uqair and fixed the final boundaries. The description is embodied in Uqair protocol No. 1. The characteristic feature of this description is that the boundary line is made to run in a series of straight lines between points named on the map, which are for the most part groups of wells. 4 . With regard to proposal {a) my observations are as follows :— The neutral zone is a lozenge shaped area containing a large number of wells known as Tiw’al adh Dhafir, i.e., the deep wells of the Dhafir. In fact the Dhafir claim them all, even A1 Uqubba, the well at the southern obtuse angle. The lozenge is not perfect and a straight line joining the eastern and western acute angles would leave the greater area and the majority of the wells on the Saudi side, indeed most of the wells are situated in the southern obtuse angle. The proposal is definitely unfavourable to Iraq, would complicate the watering problems of the Dhafir and. in my opinion, should be rejected. It would however be desirable to define by agreement the method of adminis tration of the neutral zone. 5 . The advisability or otherwise of demarcating the boundary was considered in 1927; at that time the verdict was that a demarcation would be unfavourable to Iraq for the following reasons:— (a) The traditional southern boundary of the Amarat, viz., the watershed dividing the Wadis draining northwards (known as the Widyan) from the wadis draining to the Wadi Sirhan lay considerably to the south of the line defined in the Uqair Protocol (e.g., the source of the Wadi Arar is in fact 100 miles south-west of Judaidat al Arar), and the watershed was at that time being observed as a status quo line; (b) The frontier from Qasr Uthaimin to the terminal point at Jabal Anaz was described in the Protocol as a straight line; but the description included mention of certain other points which appeared in the map then used (War Office I. M. 1917-18) to be situated on the straight line but, in the light of more recent information, were known to be really situated all to the north of the straight line between the terminal points. The boundary line would therefore follow not a single straight line but a series of straight lines running well to the north of it, i.e., even more unfavourable to Iraq. 5 . It appears to me that these objections have today lost their force since :— (a) The Saudi agents are now aware of the places named in the Protocol and are working up to them; there is thus no status quo as distinct from the legal boundary; and (b) Objection {b) was always theoretical rather than practical, since both the tribes and the agents of the two Governments know the places named by their situation on the ground, and not in terms of geographical co-ordinates.f 75 6 . Since the two Governments are anxious to remove all outstanding causes of friction, I incline to think that there would be certain advantages in demarcating the boundary. Theoretically Saudiya may stand to gain for the reasons given in para. 4; in practice Iraq would perhaps gain more, since Saudi zakat collectors would thereby be restrained from crossing into Iraqi territory as in the past, whereas there is no temptation for Iraqi Government agents to violate the boundary. 7. If it is agreed to demarcate the boundary, then it will be necessary to settle in advance one question of principle arising out of the defective drafting of the Uqair Protocol, the settlement of which would-be beyond the competence of a Demarcation Commission. 8 . The question is exemplified by the dispute regarding Judaidat A1 Arar. This is one of the points mentioned as lying on the line between Qasr Uthaimin and Jabal Anaz. The Saudi Government claims that Judaidat A1 Arar, as a point on the line, belongs equally to both states. The Iraqi Government claims that the ownership of wells mentioned in the Protocol as points on the line must be determined in the light of Article 1 (b) of the Treaty of Muhammara (quoted in para. 2 above). (My personal view is that the Saudi contention is correct, but the weight of administra tive and legal opinion in Iraq is against my view). It will therefore be necessary to refer this question (which covers all wells and tanks named in the description) to arbitration under the Protocol on Arbitration of 7th April, 1931. 9. The importance of the dispute referred to in the preceding para graph would be minimized if an agreement could be concluded whereby the flocks of one party should be exempt from taxation by the other Party 'provided their stay in the territory of the other Party did not exceed two months. It would however first be necessarv to settle the dispute regarding the allegiance of contested tribes (see note No. 2). Telegram from Sir A. Clark Kerr (Bagdad), No. 34-Saving, dated the 2'3rd November, 1936. While at Riyadh, Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs exchange ratifi cations of the Treaty of Alliance signed at Baghdad last April and concluded a new establishment convention (text of which follows by bag). He also continue discussion of points (1) and (2) mentioned in first paragraph of my despatch No. 89 of February 17th. Little progress seems to have been made with (2) but some advance towards settlement of (1) was made on the lines of paragraphs 8 and 9 of enclosure to my letter No. 17/27/36 of February 20th to Rendel. Addressed to Foreign Office, No. 34-Saving, copy to Jedda by bag. (93) Telegram from the British Legation, Jedda, dated the 3rd December 1936 My despatch No. 298, October 25th. As soon as Fuad returned I asked for explanation of Philby’s entry into Aden protectorate \vith;out permission with armed Saudi escort. Today he called to give reply from Ibn Saud. I first informed him of complaints from the Imam about Philby’s entry into Yemen. (Aden despatch 544, November 7th). Reply. Begins : 2 . Philby undertook to fix position of various points in Najran area and for this purpose was given customary guides (I interpolated “and armed escort” and Fuad did not repudiate amendment). Saudi Arabian Govern ment did not know Philby was going further south and first learned that ^ ^ad done so when they received from the Imam a protest against hisentry into the Yemen. Philby had no authorisation from Saudi Arabian Government express or implied to go outside borders of Saudi Arabia. Ends. 3. On a map which is a duplicate one given Fuad for frontier dis cussions I showed Fuad that Shabwa was far south of Ibn Saud’s territory even if his extreme claims were conceded. Fuad did not deny Shabwa was in Aden protectorate. 4. Reply did not contain apology but I concluded that is because it would not fit in with rejection of all responsibility on (sic) Philby. 5. I gather that on his return Philby would be called upon by Ibn Saud to explain his conduct. You may wish me to inform Minister for Foreign Affairs that while the extraordinary occurrence is now understood His Majesty’s Government trust person whose irresponsible conduct might have caused serious incident harmful to the good relations between the two govern ments, will be suitably dealt with. Addressed to Foreign Office, No. 122, repeated to Aden No. 8. Telegram from the Foreign Office, to Sir R. Bullard, British Lega tion, Jedda, No. 135, dated the 5th December, 1936. Your telegram No. 122 [of December 3rd; Mr. Philby’s activities in Aden Protectorate and the Yemen]. I approve your action, and proposal contained in final paragraph. For reasons given in your despatch No. 289 [of October 25th] (Serial No. 88), in which I concur, I do not wish to labour matter, but you should consider whether to include in any further communication written or oral to Saudi authorities protest against fact that Mr. Philby was accompanied on his incursion into Aden Protectorate by armed Saudi forces which might well have led Protectorate tribes to assume that he w T as travelling on a Saudi mission. Object would be to show Saudi Government that His Majesty’s Government are maintaining their position regarding Protectorate frontier and do not acquiesce in any Saudi encroachment in this area. But what you have said may be sufficient, and I am content to leave decision to you. please report in due course any explanations which Mr. Philby may furnish.

I shall bo glad to know of the future movements of yourself and Sa’udi party in the Aden Protectorate, I wish to remind you that Shabwa and the Hadhramaut are in the Aden Protectorate which is not administered by His Majesty’s Government but whose^ 1 interests are governed by His Majesty’s Government. It is therefore advisable for intending travellers to obtain the permission of this Residency before visiting places in the interior. This is all the more important when the traveller is accompanied by a party from a Foreign Government. It has been reported that you wish to visit Markha on your return journey. Please let me know if this is correct so that ample warning may be given to the upper ’ Aulaqi Sultan in whose tribe Markha lies should your visit be considered politically advisable. I will make imme diate arrangements to have the spare parts for your car and films shipped as soon as possible. Enclosure 5 to S. No. (1).

I have the honour to refer to your unnumbered telegram of September 1st, 1936 and to enclose, for your information, a copy of a telegram No. C- 1447 of September 7th which I have sent to Mr. Philby. I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires, Jedda.Enclosure 7 to S. No. (1). Telegram from Acting Resident, Aden, to Mr. Philby, Mukalla, No. C/1447, dated 7th September 1936. I have been instructed by His Majesty’s Government to request you to withdraw your Sa’udi armed party from the Aden Protectorate as soon as possible and to inform you that it would have been preferable for you to have informed British authorities of your intention to visit protectorate before your visit took place. Reference your signal of 2nd September. I appreciate that necessity took you into the Hadhramaut but as far as I am aware necessity did not take you and your Sa’udi armed party to Shabwa which is definitely within the Aden Protectorate. Further the Ahl Karab who roam the vicinity of Shabwa and whose Chief lives there are nominally vassals of the Upper Aulaqi Sultan (Handbook of Arabia). The recognised Northern boundary of the Aden Protectorate from near Dhala North eastwards is indicated by a N. E. line and is as you state undemarcated and to a great extent unexplored and the political status of territory South of this line which includes Shabwa is not a matter for discussion as it is de facto under the protection of His Ma jesty’s Government. The Bal Harith tribe N. E. of Beihan A1 Qasab are under the Sharif of Beihan who is a treaty Chief, and I must request you with your Sa’udi armed party not to enter Beihan territory including that of the Bal Harith unless traverse across a portion of the latter is necessary for topographical reasons, and should you desire to visit Beihan yourself unaccompanied by armed Sa’udis to inform me before you leave Mukalla. Your spare parts should leave Aden tomorrow. Enclosure 8 to S. No. (1). Cypher telegram from the Resident, Aden, to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, No. 71, dated 9th September 1936. (Repeated to Jedda.) Following reference Philby from reliable Hadhramaut sources. Philby told Hadhramaut notables of Ibn Saud’s intention of constructing motor road from Mecca to Hadhramaut. 300 men with Philby distributed bet ween Reidatasseiar and Alabr constructing houses. As far as is known both of these places are well within Hadhramaut (please refer to Reilly’s tele gram of the 19th March). If these reports true Philby’s assurance to me contained in telegram that his journey had no official character appears to be inaccurate. I sent telegram to Philby yesterday on lines of your un numbered telegram of 1st September. Enclosure 9 to S. No. (1). Letter from the Acting Resident, Aden, to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, No. 492, dated 30th September 1936. I have the honour to refer you to the correspondence ending with my Secret despatch No. 432 of 9th September, 1936 in connection with the re cent activities of Mr. Philby in the Aden Protectorate. 2. I returned yesterday from a visit by air to Mukalla and the Hadhramaut valley. 3. In the course of my visit I was able to make enquiries on the spot as to the extent of Mr. Philby’s Sa’udi propaganda though enquiries were scarcely necessary as both the Qu’aiti authorities at Mukalla and Shibam, and the Kathiri Sultan and influential Seiyid family of A1 Kaf in the Eastern part of the Hadhramaut valley were only too ready to open the subject without en couragement and to talk about what they considered as Mr. Philby’s unwar rantable interference.4 4 . I found that Mr. Philby had spared no pains to proclaim the merits of Sa’udi Government at every opportunity and to assert how well the people of the Hadhramaut would fare were they to come under the rule of Ibn Sa’ud. Mr. Philby declared the country between the Western boundary of the Hadh ramaut and N.ajran to be a ‘‘No man’s Land ” which would soon be taken over by Ibn Sa’ud. This includes Shabwa and A1 ’Abr, of which Shabwa (which is actually more to the South than shewn on existing maps) is well inside the Protectorate both tribally and geographically, while A1 ’Abr (which is on the main route from Najran to the Hadhramaut) is also well within the violet line and is in the territory of the Ahl Sei’ar (Sir Bernard Reilly’s Secret telegram No. 20 of 19th March 1936 and Mr. Ingram’s report—Chapters I and XIX). I have no reason to doubt the truth of the statements made to me which were given by responsible and reliable persons. 5. Mr. Philby also spread abroad that Ibn Sa’ud “ intended to make a road for motor traffic from Mecca to the Hadhramaut ”, as already reported. I have not the opportunity in this despatch to comment on the advantages of such a road being constructed. But were such a scheme to be considered it would be a matter for His Majesty’s Government to discuss with the Sa’udi Government, and for Mr. Philby to proclaim that Ibn Sa’ud “ intends ” ^ to make the road, as if the country immediately to the West of the Hadhra maut was Sa’udi territory and not part of the Aden Protectorate, is gross impertinence. 6 . I do not think that much attention was paid to Mr. Philby’s Sa’udi propaganda by those who really count in the Hadhramaut and Qu’aiti terri tory and possibly the visit of the Air Officer Commanding and myself with five aircraft immediately after Mr. Philby’s visit counteracted to a certain extent its effects. But there is always a faction in most communities who are anti-Government and an easy prey for foreign intriguers and the Hadhramaut is no exception, added to which there is an Irshadi element which has for some years been trying to overthrow the influence of the Seiyids of the Hadhramaut and to spread the tenets of the Wahabi faith. I, there fore, take a serious view of the diffusion of any determined Sa’udi propaganda in the Hadhramaut such as that in which Mr. Philby has recently been engaged. 7 . I am not in a position to give an opinion as to whether Mr. Philby’s recent activities had the support of Ibn Sa’ud. Mr. Hope Gill, who has known both for some years, thinks not. Possibly Mr. Philby’s apparent desire to cover the whole'of Arabia in the course of his travels and to try to be the first European to cross an unexplored route or to visit a town of historical interest (in this case—Shabwa) may have furnished the real reason for his recent journey, and that, being such an ardent admirer of Ibn Sa’ud, he could not resist the temptation to proclaim aloud the virtues of his hero, but, in view of the conversations now being conducted by His Majesty’s Government with the Sa’udi Government over the boundaries of Sa’udi Arabia, and of Ibn Saud’s tendency to claim more than His Majesty’s Government is willing to cede it is quite likely that Mr. Philby’s intrigue may have had the unofficial, if not the official, support of the King, and that it was financed by the latter {vide last paragraph of Royal Air Force report enclosed). In any case, as Mr. Philby is the protege of Ibn Sa ud, I assume that His Majesty’s Government will take up this matter with the Sa’udi Govern- -■rnent and address a strong protest. 8. Presumably Mr. Philby still calls himself an Englishman and I under stand that he is in receipt of a pension from the Government of India. It is all the more to be deplored, therefore, that he should deliberately work against the interests of Great Britain. 9 I enclose copies of two recent reports—one from the Intelligence branch of Air Headquarters (which is probably rather exaggerated as re gards the paragraphs 4 and 5) and the other from His Highness the Sultan of Shihr and Mukalla.Enclosure 10 to S. No. (1). El Haj Abdulla Philby : activities in the Hadhramaut. It is reported by Sheikh Omer Baobeid, a well-known merchant in Aden, who arrived from his country (Shibam) last week, that El Haj Abdulla Philby stayed many days at Shibam and told the people there that the object of his visit was to open a motor road from Nejran to the Hadhramaut and to encourage the trade in Ford cars, as he is a Ford Agent in Hejaz. He praised highly Ibn Saud, Abdul Aziz, and advised the Aqils and Sheikhs to proceed to Hejaz and to conclude a treaty with Abdul Aziz, as the latter is willing to accept this and will do his best to please them in everything. In the Hadhramaut most of the people were astonished to hear this and replied that their country was under British protection. He told them it was wrong to say that, as the Hadhramaut is an independent country and they had a lot to gain by concluding a treaty with Ibn Saud. He also said that from Nejran to the border of the Hadhramaut all the tribes agreed to be under Saudi protection. He tried to convince the Hadhramaut people of the generosity of Ibn Saud and advised them to take this chance and to accompany him back to Hejaz. He spoke ill of the British Government’s policy and indicted the British for their cruelty towards the Arabs of Palestine. He used his radio daily whilst there and allowed anyone who wished to hear it. His radio apparatus is said to be of a very costly type and can work from one battery for a thou sand hours. It is said that last year some of the Aqils of the Hadhramaut visited Ibn Saud and returned to their country praising the Sultan’s generosity. Three of the head Sheikhs of the well-known Hadhramaut tribe of Saar, accompanied Philby to Hejaz to visit the Saudi Sultan. Philby had with him three Ford cars (two lorries and a four-seater). He came to the Hadhramaut with the small car and one lorry; the second lorry was kept at Shubwa. He was very modest and generous and the Hadhramaut people liked him very much. Enclosure 11 to S. No. (1). Letter from His Highness the Sultan of Shihr and Mukalla, to the Acting Resident. After our arrival at Mukalla we interviewed Sheikh ’Abdullah Philby on several occasions. We gathered from his conversations with us that he highly praises the Sa’udi Government in a way which signifies a spirit of propaganda in their favour. It was clear from information received from the persons with whom he had interviews both at Mukalla and Hadhramaut, that he had spread pro paganda in favour of the Sa’udi Government. He also told many persons that the Sa’udi Government are prepared to render assistance to the Hadh ramaut if the people ask for it. He also explained that the tribesmen living beyond A1 ’Abr have all entered into an agreement with the Sa’udi Govern ment and that no one will dare to interfere with any traveller while on his way from A1 ’Abr to Mecca. While this does not coincide with the true facts (because Sheikh Philby himself was not able to pass through the borders of the tribesmen living beyond A1 ’Abr except by means of an escort from them) yet propaganda of this nature creates anxiety in the minds of the people, and this necessitates the taking of precautionary measures. Similarly the opening of a road for motor traffic between the Hadhra* maut and Najran in the manner prescribed by Sheikh ’Abdullah Philby calls for precautionary measures also on account of the results which might be brought about by the opening of such a route. Apart from the fact that no 65 (C) ExAffaireDept6 one of the Hadhramis would be able to travel by this road except by experiencing great difficulties and incurring heavy expenses, the Hadhramaut itself would not gain anything by the opening of this road. We therefore wish by means of the assistance of His Majesty’s Government to take such precautionary measures as may ensure the safety of the borders. We assure you that there exists no relationship between our Government and the Sa’udi Government other than the Islamic-Arab ties. While we have regard for this tie we do not in any way wish them to do anything which would disturb our minds. We welcome the visit of any mission from them at any time they like to visit the Hadhramaut on condition that they obtain permis sion from His Majesty’s Government at Aden and ourselves. The visits of armed missions to the Hadhramaut without previous information or per mission are not appreciated. We should like to bring to your notice that the Irshadiyan Community in the Hadhramaut and Java may have some connection with the Sa’udi Government. There are in this community many of the Ahl Kathir. Per haps even the Irshadiyan Community might have had a hand in the arrival of Sheikh Abdullah Philby to the Hadhramaut for at the very time in which Sheikh Abdullah Philby came to the Hadhramaut, there appeared from the Kathiri Irshaid Community a notification both on the coast and in the in terior of the Hadhramaut containing a clear call to the people to join the Flag of the Sa’udi Government. You will find herewith a copy of the notifica tion attached to this letter for your perusal. The issue of such a notification necessitates the watching of the activities of the Kathiri Community at Java. We request you kindly to think carefully over this matter. We shall watch those around us in our part. Enclosure 12 to S. No. (1). Letter from the Acting Resident, Aden, to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, No. 521, dated 21st October 1936. I have the honour to refer to my secret despatch No. 492, dated 30th September 1936, and to enclose for your information a copy of a letter dated 9th October 1936 from the Upper ’Aulaqi Sultan regarding the recent acti vities of Mr. Philby in the Aden Protectorate. 2. The Wadi Hammam and the district of Markha are situated in the ter ritory of the Upper ’Aulaqi Sultan; (reference my telegram No. 62 of 24th August), and it will be noted that Mr. Philby is reported to have arrived in Wadi Hammam on 30th September. My telegram to Mr. Philby requesting him to withdraw his party from the Aden Protectorate was dated 7th September and Mr. Philby replied on 10th September in a telegram which led one to believe that he was leaving Mukalla on that day for Shabwa to act accordingly. It is therefore apparent - that, if these reports are true (and I have no reason to doubt them), Mr. Philby deliberately disregarded the request to leave the Protectorate and act ually penetrated further in. 3. I am replying to the Upper ’Aulaqi Sultan that the Sa’udi party entered the Hadhramaut and other parts of the Protectorate without per mission, that the Sa’udi Government has not been given authority over the interior of the Hadhramaut and that there is no intention of giving them permission to enter ’Aulaqi territory. I shall add that His Majesty’s Govern ment is well aware of the loyalty to them of the Sultan and his people and shall express a hope that friendly relations between His Majesty’s Government and himself and successors will always be maintained. I am also taking advantage of his letter, after consultation with the Air Officer Commanding, o suggest and recommend the construction of a Landing ground near Shabwa. t4. As His Highness the Sultan of Lahej has informed me that it is the general opinion in the Protectorate that Mr. Philby and his party had the per mission of His Majesty’s Government and this Pesidency, X am having a paragraph published in the Aden Protectorate Gazette denying this. I am forwarding a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s Minister, Jedda. Enclosure 13 to S. No. (1). Letter from the Upper Aulaqi Stilt an, to the Political Secretary, dated 9th October 1936. We write this to inform you, oh friend, that a European with Sa’udi soldiers arrived at Shabwa some time back. We thought that they were mere travellers but they prolonged their stay at Shabwa. On 14th Rajab (30th September 1936) they arrived at Wadi Hammam with the intention of entering Markha but they were not allowed to do so by the Nasiyi tribe and therefore they returned to Shabwa which is situated on the trade route through which our merchandise passes to Hadhramaut. We are afraid that our subjects and caravans proceeding to Hadhramaut may be harmed. We request Government kindly to inform us whether the Sa’adi Govern ment have been given any authority over the Hadhrami interior. As far as we ’ Aulaqi s are concerned, we do not wish them to enter our country at all because we are already in treaty relations with the British Government and do not wish to enter into any engagement with any other Foreign Govern ments we are maintaining our friendly relations with the British Government. We request the British Government to reply to us on this subject as soon as possible. Enclosure 14 to S. No. (1). Letter from the Acting Resident, Aden, to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, No. 538, dated 28th October 1936. I have the honour to refer to Colonel Lake’s telegram No. 86, dated 23rd October 1936, and to enclose, for your information, copies of letters dated 8th and 14th October 1936 from Seiyd Ahmed bin ’Alawi A1 Jifri and Seiyid Nasir bin Muhshin respectively regarding the recent activities of Mr. Philby in the Aden Protectorate. 2. Seiyid Ahmed bin ’Alawi A1 Jifri is a member of an important family of Mansabs (Religious overseers) in the Upper ’Aulaqi country, where he is an influence for law and order, and Seiyid Nasir is one of the Chiefs of Mar kka. 3. Place references will be found in San’a map, North D. 38. 4. A notice has been inserted in the issue of the Protectorate Gazette for October that no permission of any sort was accorded to Mr. Philby for his journey into the Protectorate and that His Majesty’s Government lends no countenance whatever to the statements he is reported to have made there. Enclosure 15 to S. No. (1). Letter from Seiyid Ahmed bin Alawi Al Jifri, to the Second Political Officer, Aden, dated 8th October 1936. News reached us, oh friend, about the arrival of Mr. ’Abdullah Philby with his companions at Shabwa on the 8th Rajab (24th September 1936) and on the night of the 11th instant (27 September 1936), they were the guests of the Hammam tribe. They wanted to go to Markha but they were not allowed to do so by the Nasiyin tribe. One of the motor cars which arrived went to the lower part of the Khalifi country to a place called As-Sod to hunt8 gazelles and they killed one. They also went to the lower part of Jedan belonging to the Ahl Dhabab. It may not be hidden from your honour that the people of that part of the country were disturbed and frightened on account of this Saudian raid against the Protectorate with the consent of the British Government. But if they (British Government) are backing us, we do not care either for the Sa’udi or Imam. A letter prior to this has been sent to you and we hope it has reached you. Every tribesman is afraid of Sa’udi incursions and the subjects only want those who will look into the maintenance of peace whether they be the British Government or any Isla mic Government. Enclosure 16 to S. No. (1). Letter from Seiyid Nasir bin Muhshin of Markka one of the Aqils of Markka nominally under the Upper Aulaqi Sultan, to the Political Secretary, Aden, dated 14th October 1936. We inform you, oh friend, that two lorries arrived as far as the borders of Markha. They asked us for permission to enter our country and to have an interview with us. We declined to grant their requests. They say that they belong to Najd and have come on behalf of Bin Sa’ud. Enclosure 17 to S. No. (1). Letter from the Acting Besident, Aden, to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, No. 544, dated 4th November 1936. „ I have the honour to submit a copy of a letter received from the Kine of the Yemen on the subject of Mr. Philby’s recent journey to the Hadhramaut in the course of which it now appears that he travelled without leave through Yemeni territory. ® 2. Captain Seager, who has now returned to Aden from his visit to San’a reports that the King has been both offended and alarmed by Mr Philbv’s passage through his country. It is well known that the King has the strongest objection to the entry of any foreigners into any part of the Yemen without his previous knowledge and permission, and this Residency is always careful to respect his wishes in this respect. Mr. Philby’s arrival within Yemeni borders without authority having been obtained or even sought is therefore both an affront to the Yemeni Government and an embarrassment to the Aden Residency, through which the visists of British subjects to the Yemen are usually arranged. His inconsiderate and discourteous action has become a more serious offence through the fact that he was accompanied by an armed party and that he appears to have indulged in propaganda unfriendly to lemem interests. Ihese circumstances suggest a challenge on his part to \emem Sovereignty over the districts mentioned in the King’s letter to me. 3. The districts in question are A1 Jof and Marlb. These have been m Temem occupation since 1926 and 1927 respectively. They lie to the south ol the Saudi-Yemeni frontier established by the Treaty of Taif in 1934 and are well to the north of the boundary of the Aden Protectorate. There appears therefore to be no valid reason to question the Yemeni claim to them winch has been enforced in fact for several years, and it is prejudicial to good Anglo-lemeni relations that this claim should appear to be disputed ky f British subject, and especially by one who was formerly in the service ol the British Government and who is still regarded by many Arabs as occn Pymg a quasi-representative position in Saudi Arabia. 4. Lieut-Col on el Lake has represented to you in his despatch of 30th September the unfortunate effect of Mr. Philby’s incursion into Shabwa and the Hadhramaut and of his disregard of the line which has for manv years been accepted by His Majesty’s Government as being the northern boundary of the Aden Protectorate in that area; and I hope that it will be possible for His Majesty s Government to indicate in some unmistakable manner m respect of both the Yemen and the Aden Protectorate that they wholly condemn Mr. Philby’s mischievous adventure. yEnclosure 18 to S. No. (1). In the name of God, the Compassionate, the merciful. 2nd Shaaban, 1355, (October 21st 1936). From His Majesty the Imam Yahya bin Muhammad Hamid-ud-Bin, to His Excellency Sir Bernard Reilly, K.C.M.G., C.I.E., O.B.E., Resident, etc. We extend to your Excellency our respects. We beg to call your kind attention to an incident which we regret to report to Your Excellency and which has happened during your absence from Aden on leave. This incident has caused all kinds of doubt and un easiness in all parts of the country and a great deal of surprise and amaze ment due to our ignorance of its reason. Mr. Philby, wl o has chosen to reside in the Hejaz for some years, claimed in the month of July last to be the representative of Great Britain and thus earned for himself the immunities and privileges accorded to Political Re presentation. He brought a group of armed men and, with them, crossed the Yemini Boundary in ears near Najran and came down to the Hadhramaut where he told them (the Hadhramis) different stories. He claimed that he would construct a motorcar road between the Hejaz and the Hadhramaut and that he would erect in some places stations and buildings. We have heard from certain people that Mr. Philby encouraged our people to take aggressive measures against the Yemeni Government and its territories. He entered Marib and Jof and said different things. Mr. Philby is a British sub ject and is still under British protection. His entrance into our country with armed men without permission violates international regulations as does his wandering about within our country and the making of declarations against our Government. His strange conduct has excited our people and W e are sure that Great Britain never permits or encourages any such unwarranted behaviour. We therefore earnestly beg Your Excellency to request your Govern ment, who is aware of every single thing that happens, to inquire carefully into the matter and to be good enough to inform us of the real reason for this strange incident. We also request the British Government to inflict a suitable punishment on Mr. Philby and to assure the non-repetition of such an incident in the future. In conclusion we extend our respect and wishes for your good health. Enclosure 19 to S. No. (1).

My telegram No. 64, dated the 30th August, Philby with two Saudi servants is at present in Mukalla which he reached via Terim and Shihr while his main party is in Shabwa. Apparently one of his cars broke down near Shibam and he has now telegraphed to Aden for spares which will be forwarded to him. I have asked him to inform me of his future movements.

You should also inform 65(C) ExAffairsDept.him that in any event it would have been preferable for him to have informed British authorities of his intention to visit Protectorate before visit took place. Enclosure 21 to S. No. (1). Letter from Secretary of State, Colonial Office, to Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office, No. 78150/36, dated 19th November 1936. I am directed by Mr. Secretary Ormsby Gore to refer to the letter from this Department of the 7th November enclosing copies of correspondence relating to the activities of Mr. Philby in the Aden Protectorate and to transmit to you, for the information of Mr. Secretary Eden, a copy of a further despatch and enclosure from the Resident at Aden. 2. Mr. Ormsby Gore is of opinion that the reports contained in this and previous despatches, copies of which have been transmitted from time to time to the Foreign Office, are sufficient indication that Mr. Philby did not confine his activities in the Aden Protectorate to those of an ordinary travel ler, but that in the course of his visit he persistently spread political propa ganda in favour of the Saudi Government. Mr. Ormsby Gore further con siders that the circumstances justify a strong protest being made to the Saudi Government, and I am accordingly to request that, if Mr. Eden sees no ob jection His Majesty’s Representative at Jedda be instructed to make repre sentations on the following lines :— (1) His Majesty’s Government consider that it was in any circumstances impolitic and discourteous on the part of Mr. Philby to enter the Aden Pro tectorate accompanied by Saudi personnel without first informing the Re sident at Aden and seeking permission, and that in the present case, in which the Saudi party which accompanied him was armed, his action was quite unwarrantable. In spite of the Acting Resident’s request that he should withdraw his party, he deliberately attempted to penetrate further into the Protectorate. (2) It is apparent that Mr. Philby, in the course of his journeys in the Protectorate sought to convince the people of the advantages which would accrue to them if they were to come under the rule of the Saudi Government, and even suggested that the Saudi Government would be prepared to render assistance to them if it were asked for. He generally gave the impression that parts of the Protectorate were a “ No Man’s Land ” which would one day be absorbed into the Saudi Kingdom. In his statements concerning the designs of the Wahabi King to construct a motor road from Mecca to the Hadhramaut, he appears to have ignored the fact that before any such work were undertaken it would first be necessary to consult the British Govern ment, since a large part of the territory through which the road would pass is under the protection of His Majesty. (3) It is clear that Mr. Philby’s visits to certain of the local Sheikhs were unsolicited and that his activities in their territories were regarded by them as being an unwarrantable interference in their local affairs. More over, the statements which he made appear to have given rise to a feeling of apprehension amongst certain of the local Sheikhs that some arrangement for the control of this area might have been reached, unknown to them, bet ween His Maiesty’s Government and the Saudi Government. It appears that this feeling was shared by the King of the Yemen. In view of the en tirely false impression created by Mr. Philby it was found necessary to insert a notice in the issue of the Protectorate Gazette for October to the effect that no permission of any sort was accorded to Mr. Philby for his journey into the Protectorate and that His Majesty’s Government lent no countenance whatever to the statements he was reported to have made there. (4) His Majesty’s Government feel that the attitude adopted by Mr. Philby and the statements made by him during his visit to the Protectorate are not in accord with the friendly relations existing between His Majesty’s Government and the Saudi Government.11 ( 2 ) {Received on 23rd January 1937 with Political Secretary's letter No. 1, dated 7 th January 1937).

With reference to your telegram No. 93 of the 17th September, enquiring whether any light can be thrown from Jedda upon the activities of Mr. Philby in the Hadhramaut, I have the honour to report that no information of any kind has come to the notice of the Legation, from local sources, save that since the receipt of your telegram under reference enquiries made from Mr. Philby’s firm of Sharqieh Ltd. have elicited the fact that they have recently received a letter from Mokalla in which Mr. Philby stated his intention of returning to the Hejaz via Najran. I consider it unlikely that the clerk in charge of Sharqieh Ltd. knows anything more than the bare facts of his employer’s ^ movements. 2. It will be observed from paragraph 196 of Jedda Report for May last, that Mr. Philby was reticent about his plans, before departure on this journey but that Sir Andrew Ryan derived the impression that the undertaking was one of Mr. Philby’s periodical journeys of exploration. 3.

Ihis is claimed as proof of the friendly disposition of the fascist State towards Arab countries generally, with whom Italy desires to promote economic relations based on respect for their institutions and for a mobility. I he article alludes to the circulation in the press in some Arab countries of reports that Italy intended to attack the Yemen, and de clares it superfluous to publish further denials of such reports (which it attri- butes to unspecified foreign sources), in view of the Duce’s pronouncement that Italy will now confine her activities to the peaceful development of Ethiopia. r 3.

This consists of a finely worked gold and enamel collar and it is bes towed only on the Heads of States. 2 . Dr. Naji Beg also informed me that he had been entrusted by King Ghazi with the task of conveying to the Amir Sa’ud an invitation to pay an official visit to Iraq. This invitation had been accepted and arrangements w^ere being made for His Royal Highness to come to Iraq next April when he was on his way to Great Britain to attend the Coronation of His Majesty the King. 3 .

Personal letter from British Legation Jedda, to His Royal Highness the Amir Feysal, Mecca, No. 2102/316/55, dated 6th December 1936. I have the honour to address Your Royal Highness upon a matter which I treated orally with His Excellency Fuad Bey Hamsa and should have preferred to continue to treat orally, only His Excellency has left Jedda and may not be back for some time. The question is the journey of Mr. Philby into the Aden Protectorate with an armed Saudi force without notice having been given to the Protectorate authorities beforehand. I duly reported to my Government the assurance of the Saudi Arab Government that they did not know Mr. Philby intended to go south of Naj- ran, and that he had no authorisation from them, whether express or implied, to proceed with the armed force outside the borders of Saudi Arabia. His13 Tpr-' - * Majesty’s Government were very glad to receive this assurance, which con firms the supposition which they had already formed on the subject, and they now understand the extraordinary occurrence. I am however to point out that the arrival of Mr. Philby in the Aden Protectorate with an armed Saudi force might have caused an incident or on the other hand might have led the tribes in those parts to suppose that Mr. Philby had come on a mission from the Saudi Arab Government, either of which results would have been harmful to the good relations which have subsisted for so long between the two governments. In conclusion I am to inform Your Royal Highness that His Majesty’s Government trust that suitable action will be taken in regard to the person whose irresponsible conduct might have led to so regrettable a consequence.

Reply from Minister for Foreign Affairs to my personal letter of December 8 th [S.

My statement concluded thus. [gp. undec. we might be in] Najran, though, Philby as an explorer would be use ful to Saudi Government and he was acting in a manner as their employee (Fuad nodded assent), and in any case to steal away without their know ledge with an escort granted for that prupose and to use it to enter Aden protectorate was a nasty trick and we expected Saudi Government to tell him so. I think matter can be left there. 2. Copies of correspondence and despatch follow by bag. Addressed to Foreign Office telegram No. 129, repeated to Aden telegram No. 12.

I have the honour to report that, after the exchange of notes on the 3rd October, Sheikh Yusuf Yasin asked whether he could see me about ceitain other questions, and it was arranged that he should call at the Legation on thu 5th October. He had already asked whether I wished to continue the dis. cussion of the Koweit and frontier questions or would prefer to await tho return of Fuad Bey Hamza, which was expected to occur very soon, and I told him that the Saudi counter-draft of article 1 of the proposed Koweit 55(C) ExAffairsDept14 regulations against smuggling was being considered by His Majesty’s Govern ment, and that, as to the other matters, it would perhaps be well for me to wait until Fuad Bey’s return, since I was new to the post, and needed as much time as possible to make myself fully acquainted with the relevant files. Sheikh Yusuf had made no objection to this, and had concluded that all ques tions of major interest were therefore in abeyance, and that on the 5th October he would discuss minor questions at issue, such as the blacklisting of certain pilgrim guides. He, however, embarked upon a long statement on foreign affairs, which, he said, he had been charged to make by His Majesty King Abdul Aziz. He spoke very carefully, hesitating from time to time, as though to recall Ibn Baud’s exact words. The statement, however, was so clearly, in its more important parts, only a repetition of many statement^ made to the Legation during the Ethiopian dispute, that it has been possible to cut down to a page or so the summary which I attach to the present despatch. 2. In reply, I said that Sheikh Yusuf must not expect a detailed answer. I was new to the post, and I had not been warned what he proposed to talk about. (I might have reminded him that when he asked for a meeting I had enquired whether he wished to speak of anything of great importance, so that I might be prepared, and that he had waved this aside.) As to Palestine, I was happy to say that, when I was received by Mr. Eden after my appoint ment, he authorised me to convey to His Majesty King Abdul Aziz his personal thanks for the help offered in connexion with the Palestine dispute. On all other points except one my remarks were purely conventional. The exception was Italy, though even on this point I confined myself to genera lities. I said that it was clearly impossible for me to go beyond statements made to the Saudi Government by Sir Andrew Byan, acting on instructions from His Majesty’s Government. For myself, I would suggest that the Saudi Government should take a long view and not think only of the Ethiopian question, which had been complicated by the fact that the whole world was trying to find a solution by hitherto untried methods. The Saudi attitude towards the Italian offer of money and arms was presumably prompted by a desire to maintain their independence, an aim which must have the fullest sympathy of His Majesty’s Government. His Majesty would do well to look again at the Rome understanding of 1927. It was not usual to give such assurances as the Saudi Arab Government had wished to receive. What would happen would depend on world affairs, on a host of circumstances. The King had at least one solid fact to go upon—the long experience of His Majes ty’s Government to which Sheikh Yusuf had referred with appreciation. I stated that what Sheikh Yusuf had said would be reported to the Foreign Office, and I concluded with suitable thanks for the assurances of friendship, and with similar assurances on our own part. 3. Since the meeting which I have described, I have read with great attention all the papers relating to the attempt made by Ibn Saud a few months ago to obtain from His Majesty’s Government assurances that they w ould assist him if he should be threatened by the Italians. It is difficult to see what Ibn Saud expects to gain by raising this point again, when it has been dealt with so fully and so many times by my predecessor, acting on instructions from His Majesty’s Government. But I did not gather that Ibn Saud was really expecting a more favourable reply, but only that he was stat ing his position. Perhaps he felt that it was the proper thing to do, on the appointment of a new British Minister, to give a summary of his foreign policy as it affects His Majesty’s Government. And then the oriental always attaches importance to individuals, and hopes that B will get him better terms than were offered by B’s predecessor, A. 4 . I imagine that you will wish me to express my thanks for the assurances of friendship, and perhaps your particular pleasure, at Ibn Sand’s remember ing occasions before the war when the support of His Majesty’s Government v^as of assistance to him, and to say, with regard to the references made by Sheikh Yusuf Yasin to Italy, that Sir Andrew Ryan went into this question so fully and explained so clearly the attitude of His Majesty’s Government that I am unable to add anything to what he said. I await your instructions.15 Enclosure to letter No. 283, dated 2nd November 1936. Brief Summary of a Statement made by Sheikh Yusuf Yasin to His Majesty's Minister on October 5, 1936. FRIENDSHIP with His Majesty’s Government had long been the basis of Ibn Sand’s foreign policy. He had been in relations with them since the early days of his career and was grateful for their support. In particular, he was grateful for the help they gave him at a moment when the Turks were about to attack him. They asked the Turks to give them a few months’ notice before the beginning of hostilities, so that British subjects and their property might be removed from Nejd, and, in the interval, he was able to come to terms with the Turks. Ibn Saud now saw danger in three quarters : near, farther off, and remote, viz., Italy, Turkey and Germany. (N.B.—Germany was not mentioned again.) The Italians had been the last to recognise Saudi Arabia, and their conduct in regard to Asir and the Yemen had been very suspicious, but at the time of the Ethiopian dispute there had been a complete revolu tion in their policy towards Saudi-Arabia. Italy had recently wished to give Ibn Saud arms and munitions to the value of perhaps £1 million. He had not wanted to accept, but, to avoid giving offence, he had accepted a few aeroplanes. He had informed Sir Andrew Ryan, and had asked whether His Majesty’s Government could give him assurances. He regretted that they had not been able to do more than refer him to the Rome understanding of 1927. The Turks were ancient enemies of the Arabs, and resented the rise to Independence and importance of people whom they regarded as savages. It was fear of the Turks that had impelled him to initiate the^negotiations that had ended with the treaty with Iraq. (Here Sheikh Yusuf Yasin made a brief but very cordial reference to Iraq.) Difficulties with Transjordan arose from time to time (Sheikh Yusuf hinted that these were due to the incurable levity of character of the Amir Abdullah) but Ibn Saud did not want trouble there. He had always been conciliatory, and he trusted that with the help of His Majesty’s Government such difficulties as arose would always be settled satisfactorily. As to Syria, Ibn Saud had made a point of keeping on good terms with the French. In regard to Palestine, Ibn Saud had no other aim than to see peace re-estab lished between two parties, both of whom were his friends. The statement ended with conventional but strong assurances of friend ship. * (9) (Received on 30th January 1937 with Political Secretary's letter No. 2, dated 14th, January 1937.) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter No. E.-8002-7186-25, dated 5th January 1937. Letter from British Legation, Jedda, to the Right Hon’ble Anthony Eden, No. 315, dated 7th December 1936. Colonel Etherton and Lt.-Col. Micklem, about whom I had the honour to receive your instructions conveyed in Foreign Office telegram No. 129, dated 19th November, left yesterday for the Sudan, whence they proposed to return to London by air. They have not secured the mining concession which was the object of their journey. From other sources I gather that the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate Ltd. succeeded in preventing the grant of the concession to Selection Trust Ltd., though it does not appear that the Syndicate have obtained it for themselves. Lt. Col. Mick lem speaks of the last Saudi offer as being still open, but professes to be dis illusioned as to the value of the concession and to hope that his Board will not close with the offer. One of his objections is that the area concerned16 begins over two hundred miles from the Red Sea Coast and that transport difficulties would therefore be very great. The area is apparently the one which lies just beyond the Syndicate’s eastern boundary and which is coveted by the Syndicate as a valuable supplement to the concession they already hold. 2 . The negotiators seem to have found the Saudi authorities lukewarm, presumably because of the other bidders. There was no official of standing within reach, and they had to negotiate through the Director of Public Works in Jedda, Najib Salha, who only a few years ago was a clerk in the employ of Messrs. Gellatly Hankey here. Towards the end of their stay, however, they at least had the satisfaction of a long interview with Fuad Bey, who had by then returned from abroad and from his subsequent visit to Mecca. 3. As your telegram did not reach me until the afternoon of November 20th and Colonel Etherton was due the next day, I assumed that he was arriv ing by aeroplane in any case and that what was required was merely a noti fication to the local authorities. The notification was given, but Colonel Etherton had been trying in Cairo to get permission from the Saudi Govern ment for the aeroplane to land in Jedda, and failing to get permission he and his companion flew to Port Sudan and crossed by steamer, arriving at Jedda several days later than if they had travelled from Egypt by sea. Colonel Etherton also failed, in spite of an appeal he made to Fuad Bey, to get per mission for the aeroplane to come to Jedda to fetch him and Col. Micklem and, they crossed to the Sudan and proceeded by air from there. I knew of their difficulty in this matter, but believing that if a company which was a possible source of income to Ibn Saud could not by its own efforts obtain permission for an aeroplane to land here, support from the Legation would almost certainly be ineffective and that in any case, since the Saudi authorities are not likely to make this privilege general, intervention on this occasion might be a cause of embarrassment if similar applications should be received in future. The question however calls for examination, and I am studying 4. A copy of this despatch is being sent to the Department of Overseas Trade. ( 10 ) {Received on 8th February 1937 with Political Secretary's letter No. 3, dated 21st January 1937.) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter, dated 12th January 1937. Letter from British Legation, Jedda, to the Right Hon’ble Anthony Eden, No. 314, dated 6th December 1936. With reference to Sir Andrew Ryan’s despatch No. 156 (1447/132/14) dated 26th May 1933, regarding the distribution of wireless stations in Saudi Arabia, and to subsequent despatches on the same subject ending with Mr. Calvert’s No. 210 (1734/157/9), dated 22nd July 1933, I have the honour to inform you that according to a report published in the “ Saut al Hejaz ” on November 17th, two new wireless stations which are entirely unaffected by atmospherics have been erected at Riyadh and Abha. The report adds that the Saudi Government are endeavouring to obtain a number of other sets of this type for erection in various places. 2. The only other information on this point that J have been able to obtain has been furnished by representative of the firm of Sharqieh Ltd. who state that Messrs. Marconi did not supply these new sets. They also gave a piece of information which was new to the Legation, viz., that a German interested in wireless installation visited Jedda last spring and is believed to have disposed of at least one set here—a set mainly designed for reception but able to transmit up to short distances useful for local purposes.3. From the 1933 despatch quoted above it will be seen that whereas Abha had only an old Telefunken set, there was at Riyadh a new Marconi station of six kilowatts. 4. Copies of this despatch are being sent to the Department of Overseas Trade, Baghdad, Bushire and Jerusalem. (ii) (Received on 8th February 1937 with Political Secretary's letter No. 3, dated 21st January 1937.) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter, dated 18th January 1937. Letter from the Residency, Cairo, to the Right Hon’ble Anthony Eden, No. 1385, dated 18th December 1936. Since my despatch No. 1383 of December 17th was written, I have re ceived your despatch No. 1155 (E 7344/2617/91) enclosing a record of a con versation between the Saudi Minister in London and Mr. Rendel on November 23rd. 2 . I have read this report with especial interest seeing that it very much bears out the train of ideas elaborated in my despatch under reference. The information in King Ibn Saud’s possession clearly confirms what we have heard from other independent sources, namely an intensification of Italian intrigue in the Yemen. 3. I have never disguised the extreme gravity with which I view the situa tion that is apparently now developing. At great pains we have been elabo rating with Egypt arrangements for the safeguarding of the Suez Canal as an essential link in our Imperial Communications. I trust I am in error in fearing that those communications risk being blocked by Italy at the other (southern) end of the Red Sea. 4. Viewed from that angle, the present overture of King Ibn Saud through his Minister as recorded in Mr. Renders note strikes me as being of the highest potential importance : and I most earnestly trust that it be not lightly turned down or ignored. Ibn Saud, who is a particularly powerful character and the dominant factor in Arab politics to-day, is doubtless acting mainly through motives of self-interest: so indeed are we. But it seems to me clear from what the Saudi Minister said that Ibn Saud fears that the Italians, having gained the domination—if not indeed the annexation—of the Yemen will next turn their attention to the neighbouring Hedjaz and other contiguous Saudi territory. Clearly it is one thing to have the Imam as a neighbour : it is quite another to have the Italians. 5. I have long felt convinced that we are approaching the parting of the ways with Italy, who, having annexed Abyssinia was certain sooner or later—and probably sooner than later—to try and do the same thing across the Red Sea in the Yemen. I am more convinced than ever that that is her aim and ambition. If I am correct—and I believe I am—there seems to me only two alternatives : (a) some arrangement with Italy that will de finitely check her expansion at the Southern end of the Red Sea and prevent this threat to our interests ; (b) a trial of strength with Great Britain to ensure that such expansion does not take place. 6 . I am well aware of the present conversations between London and Rome with a view to a “ detente ” in our relations. And I trust I may nof be considered out of order or an alarmist if, nonetheless, I formally record my doubt whether any understanding with Italy in her present mood of cocksureness is going to achieve what we want, or put an end to the growing threat to the safety of our communications at the Southern end of the Red Sea, coupled with the safety of Perim and our possession of Aden. 7. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda&gt; to the Chief Commissioner and Resident and Commander-in-Chief, Aden, and to the Governor-General of the Sudan. 45(C ExAffairaDept18 ( 12 ) (Received on 8th February 1937 with Political Secretary's letter No. 3, dated 21st January, 1937.)

Although the now famous Maffey Report found there was little to fear from an occupation of Abyssinia by Italy, the view of Europeans, Arabs and Somalis in the Red Sea area appears to be that the conflict between Italy and Great Britain i? all but certain to break out within the next few years. They only differ on the subject of time : when it will become impossi ble for Great Britain to acquiesce further in their lines of communications to Egypt and the Eastern Mediterranean and their territories in Africa and Arabia being threatened by the Black Army of Italy. In 1935 Italy pre pared for a war against the Abyssinians, they say ; in 1939 or 1940 she will prepare for a war against British territories, possibly when Britain is already engaged in the Far East or in Europe. 18. Points of interest which arose in conversations may be summarised as follows :— (a) Although the King of the Yemen is anti-Italian, he is old. His Prime Minister is strongly pro-Italian and the King’s son is being educated at Asmara by the Italians. (b) A great deal of pro-Italian propaganda is going on in the Yemen and considerable sums of money are being spent by the Italians in this territory. (c) Tw r o Battalions of Yemen troops have been formed as part of the Italian Army of Abyssinia. (d) A number of Somali Battalions are also being formed. Recruits are being paid 300 lira a month. It is reported that this pay is attracting even British Somali seamen: out of 45 told recently to report only 2 came forward. (e) Imports into Abyssinia are being confined to Italian products and manufactures. British goods are being refused entry. The economic position of Italy and her Colonies makes such action necessary. (f) The Italian troops are discontented and the majority are to be repatriated. The future Italian Army in Abyssinia is to con sist of 40,000 Italian and 160,000 black troops. With this Army it is not thought that Italy will find it difficult to sub jugate the country. Their ‘ frightfulness ’ against the black population is likely, as in Libya, to have the desired effect. (g) Great Britain has ‘ lost face ’ greatly in the whole native area of North East Africa and Arabia. The people are not interested in -what is said, but in what happens, and Italy has seized Abyssinia despite the opposition of Great Britain. 19. The view appears to be held generally that Great Britain is only too prone to believe the unfriendly actions and statements of a foreign power to be bluff. That the policy of Italy in the Red Sea is definitely aimed at damaging the strategic position of Great Britain. That in a war with Italy is19 it would be a struggle for lines of communication, and that should the de fences of Aden, and the forces stationed there during the recent emergency represent the strength we considered adequate to safeguard our lines of com munication, then there was a great surprise in store tor us. The present state of the defences of Aden—* * * * *—virtually invite attack. The six 3-inch H. A. guns would have been little if any deterrent, and the air forces, owing to their lack of speed and endurance, could only have been used for night bombing of the nearest objectives. * * * * (13) (Received on 20th February 1937 with Political Secretary's letter No. 5, dated 4th February 1937.)

I had the honour to receive your views on Mr. Philby’s entry into the Aden Protectorate, in your telegram No. 135, dated December 5th. I should have preferred to dispose of the matter by another conversation with Fuad Bey, but by then he had left for Riyadh for a stay which might extend to seve ral weeks, and I therefore wrote to the Amir Feysal the letter [S. No. (6)] of which a copy was sent to you under No. 319 on December 8th. The reply of December 21st, which was forwarded in translation under No. 329 of De cember 22nd, was not satisfactory. The Saudi authorities continued to de fend themselves, which was not necessary, as their disclaimer had been accept ed. On the other hand they put forward what was obviously a defence supplied by Mr. Philby, including the irrelevance about the vagueness of the frontier and the impertinence about his readiness to show his British passport had there been any frontier authorities to show it to. And they assumed, as the King of the Yemen assumed when complaining of a similar incursion by Mr. Philby into the Yemen (this was reported to the Colonial Office in Aden despatch No. 544, dated November 7th) that as a British subject Mr. Philby ought to be punished by His Majesty’s Government if he had com mitted any offence against the laws and regulations of the Aden Protectorate. I was about to reply to this letter when Fuad Bey returned to Jedda and I was able to speak to him again on the subject. 2. I told Fuad Bey that I assumed he had had a hand in the Saudi reply since he had been at Riyadh during the time when my letter was awaiting an answer. The reply ignored an essential point which I had brought out clearly in my first talk with him on the subject, viz., the unannounced arrival at Shabwa with the Saudi “ escort It was true that when one of his cars broke down Mr. Philby had had to go into the Hadhramaut for spares : the Aden authorities admitted that; but this admission did not cover Shabwa, which no necessity compelled him to visit without informing the authorities beforehand of his desire to do so. Here Fuad asked with what appeared to be real surprise whether Shabwa was not in the Hadhramant. I suspect that what had happened was this. When Fuad was called upon to concoct a defence to my letter he got out his copy of the map on which I had shown him Shabwa (Geographical Section of the General Staff No. 3891, 1930, with corrections to 1935), and also the apologia which Mr. Philby must have sent to Ibn Saud. From the lettering on the map Shabwa might be in the Hadh ramaut, and Mr. Philby will doubtless have reported that the Aden authorities found it not unreasonable that he should have entered the Hadhramaut for spares and supplies : hence the whole incident had been condoned by Aden. I disposed of this by saying that Shabwa, though a long way inside the Aden Protectorate, is not in the Hadhramaut and that it was not a need for stores, and spares that drove Mr. Philby to visit Shabwa, which was obviously his goal from the beginning. Here I reminded Fuad Bey of the incursion into the Yemen, but he replied that possibly the Imam only imagined that the places visited by Mr. Philby formed part of Jof and Marib. 1 did not pur sue this side issue.20 3. Throughout the conversation I tried to do two things : to distinguish clearly between the innocence of the Saudi Government and the responsibility of Mr. Philby, and to speak of Mr. Philby’s action with what seems to me the proper mixture of seriousness and ridicule. I told Fuad Bey that Mr. Philby was an old colleague and acquaintance of mine. Everyone knew that he enjoyed being obstinate and tiresome, particularly when His Majesty’s Government were concerned—a quality of which there was clear evidence in the Saudi reply to my letter, as in the nonsense about his readiness to show his British passport (Fuad Bey laughed at this and did not deny that the ar gument was Philby’s). It was not a question of our punishing him for an offence but of our making it clear to the Saudi Government that his action might have brought them under the suspicion of committing a serious diplo matic impropriety. He had obtained an armed “ escort ” from the Saudi authorities for the purpose of topographical work in Najran. The results of this work would be interesting to him as an explorer, but they would also be of great use to the Saudi Government, and Mr. Philby was in a way acting as their employee. (Fuad Bey did not object to this statement, but on the contrary nodded assent.) In any case, I went on, the “ escort ” was provided for this specific purpose, but Mr. Philby, carefully concealing his intention both from the Saudi Government and from the British autho rities, used it for a quite different purpose, viz., to enter the Aden Protectorate two hundred miles away. In fact, Mr. Philby had played a nasty trick upon the Saudi authorities and we expected them to make this quite clear to him. 4. Fuad Bey took no exception to anything in my statement, which I said I mu^tt follow up with a letter ( a copy of this letter is enclosed) to make the point about Shabwa quite clear. He did not say that any action would be taken, but Ibn Saud will not be pleased at the dust which Mr. Philby has raised at this moment, when he is on his best behaviour towards His Majesty’s Government. If he had an inkling beforehand of what was in Mr. Philby’s mind he cannot have reaslied what it would involve. On the other hand as an oriental he cannot feel called upon to be very harsh with a man who is a British subject and in receipt of a pension from British sources and whom, in his opinion, we could punish ourselves if we wished. More over he cannot fail to be flattered if Mr. Philby tells him, as he doubtless will, that Ibn Baud’s name and “ escort ” were sufficient to ensure safe entry into a town which it is difficult to enter from the direction of the territory of which the British claim that it forms part. But Ibn Saud has now no doubt about our attitude in regard to the Aden boundary, and he will not lightly let Philby loose with an escort again. I felt that the best line to take was that Mr. Philby had abused the confidence placed in him by Ibn Saud. This argument might even appeal to (VTr. Philby himself, who seems to have a sense of loyalty towards Ibn Saud such as he does not feel towards His Majesty’s Government; but that would involve an admission that he was in the wrong, and Mr. Philby is never in the wrong. 5. I will not fail to carry out your instructions to report any explanation which Mr. Philby may give. I foresee that he will dramatise himself as a Prometheus, bringing the fire of archaeological knowledge from Shabwa with His Majesty’s Government in the part of Zeus, and H. M. Minister as the vulture with no other business in life but to peck at Mr. Philby’s long- suffering liver, already deeply pitted from similar heroic experiences in India and Iraq and Trans-Jordan. 6 . Copies of this despatch and enclosure are being sent to H. M Chief Commissioner at Aden. 6 Enclosure 1 to S. No. (13). Personal letter from the British Legation, Jedda, to His Royal Highness the Amir Feysal, Mecca, No. 2211/316/62, dated 29th December 1936. Since I had the honour to receive Your Royal Highness’s personal letter about Mr. Philby’s journey, No. 2/9/6, dated 21st December, I have hadthe opportunity to see His Excellency Fuad Bey and to speak of the matter again. It is true that when one of Mr. Philby’s cars broke down the Aden autho rities did not object to his going into the Hadhramaut to obtain spares, but no such need drove Mr. Philby to visit Shabwa, which is incontestably in the Aden Protectorate though not in the Hadhramaut and it was in parti cular on the question of Shabwa that I based the earlier conversation which I had with His Excellency Fuad Bey. No suspicion can attach to the Govern ment of H. M. King Abdul Aziz in this matter in view of the assurances which they have given, but Your Royal Highness will permit me to say that it is for His Majesty’s Government to judge how the arrival of Mr. Philby with an armed Saudi force (or escort) might be viewed by persons living in the Aden Protectorate. But I do not wish to prolong this question any further, and I conclude by stressing the comment which I made to His Excellency Fuad Bey on December 26th as to the great impropriety committed by Mr. Philby in procuring an armed force (or escort) from the Saudi Government for topo graphical work in Najran and using it, without their knowledge, for a quite different and an illegitimate purpose, viz., to enter the territory of the Aden Protectorate, (14) {Received on 20th February 1937 with Political Secretary's letter No. 5, dated iih February 1937.) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter, dated 27th January 1937. Letter from Foreign Office, London, to Sir Miles Lampson, Cairo, No. 81, dated 25th January 1937. I have read with interest Your Excellency’s Secret despatch No. 1385 (820/4/36) of the 18th December [S. No. (11)], regarding the question of Italian activities in the Yemen. I am fully alive to the most disquieting features of the situation discussed in your despatch and the question of the policy of His Majesty’s Government in this matter is forming the subject of consi deration in the Middle East Official Sub-Committee of the Committee of Im perial Defence. 2. In the meantime, while I do not wish to minimise the dangers of the position, there are certain considerations which suggest that the Italian Gov ernment may not be so firmly determined on a policy of intensive penetration in the Yemen as has sometimes been suggested. I shall welcome an early expression of your views on the following considerations. 3. In the first place, as you are aware, the Italian Government have vir tually undertaken in the Rome understanding with His Majesty’s Govern ment of 1927 not to establish themselves at any point on the Arabian coast of the Red Sea. I realise that it would be unwise to place too much reliance on such an undertaking on the part of the Italian Government but it should be noted that it is accompanied by a corresponding virtual undertaking on the part of His Majesty’s Government that they also will not establish them selves on any point of the Arabian coast of the Red Sea; and that the Italian Government have in the past shown that they attach great importance to this undertaking to which they have frequently appealed. The view has more than once been expressed that one of the many motives inspiring Italian policy to-day is a fear that His Majesty’s Government may themselves be aim ing at some extension of their territorial or political influence in Arabia. Such a fear is unfounded, but to the Italian mind it may appear to possess some reality, and it cannot, therefore, be entirely excluded in considering Ita lian policy in this area. The Italians no doubt realise that if they were to violate the Rome understanding of 1927 they would thereby free His Majesty’s Government from any obligation under that understanding. They would thus enable His Majesty’s Government to occupy any area they desired in the Yemen bb(C) Ex Affairs Dept22 such as, for example, Sheikh Said or the hinterland in the neighbourhood of the Aden Protectorate frontier near Taiz (where indeed British control might be welcomed). Moreover, they would justify His Majesty’s Govern ment ih entering into closer and more intimate relations with King Ibn Saud. 4. No doubt Italian local authorities in Africa and officers of the Italian Army, Navy and Air Force—looking at this question from the purely military, naval or air point of view—are anxious to secure for themselves a position of predominant influence in the Yemen. But in view of the considerations urged above it is questionable whether the Italian Government in Rome, who are fully aware of the magnitude of their task in Abyssinia and of the risks involved in any new adventure in Arabia, are as eager as the Italian fighting services to pursue a definitely aggressive policy on the Arabian coast of the Red Sea. 5. The above considerations are not conclusive, but they deserve to b e taken into account in any appreciation of the situation. In addition to you r observations on them, I desire to learn your views on the whole question of Italian activities in Arabia in the light of such bearing as, in your opinion? the conclusion of the Anglo-Egyptian alliance has upon it. 6 . I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s Ambassador in Rome and to His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda. (15) {Received on 13th February 1937 with Political Secretary's letter No. 4, dated 28th January 1937.) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter dated 21st January 1937. Personal letter from Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mecca, dated 21st December 1936. With reference to Your Excellency’s personal letter No. 2102/316/55 of December 8th, 1936, I have the honour to inform you that I am glad to learn that the British Government were pleased with the assurance given by the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs regarding the (nature of the) de parture from Najran by Mr. Philby. The information given to you by the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs explains the attitude of the Govern ment of H. M. the King on this question. It has been a cause of regret to the Government of H. M. the King that the matter should have left any consequences (literally. “ tails ”) and that an importance which it does not in fact possess should be attributed to it. Your Excellency may be assured that, in remote,, deserts it is very difficult to distinguish the actual frontiers if they are not fixed and known, just as it is difficult to comply with the special arrangements concerning the crossing of the frontiers particularly when there are no special ^ officials for such purpose. Moreover, as the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs has already explained to you, the Government of H. M. the King had no knowledge of the intention of Mr. Philby to go to the Hadhramaut. It was therefore impossible for the necessary application to be made for per mission for him to go there. I have moreover learnt that when Mr. Philby was asked by the responsible authorities in the Hadhramaut why he had gone there in such manner he replied that he held a British passport and that he was prepared to produce it to the frontier officials had there been any. I have also learnt that Mr. Philby has explained to the responsible authorities in the Hadhramaut the reasons for his going there and that he was not entrusted with any mission by the Government of H. M. the King and that he only went into the Hadhramaut because he had to get his cars repaired and to obtain some articles which he needed. It appears that they were satisfied with his explanations and afforded him the required assistance. Had it not been so, it would have been their concern, and within their power to take the measures they thought proper against him.23 In any case I think the importance attached to the journey of Mr. Philby and the impression it caused or might have caused have been much exaggera ted especially if we take into consideration the fact that his journey was not made by order of the Government nor with their permission. As to the armed persons said to have accompanied Mr. Philby, they were merely such guides, guards and servants as escort every one who travels in the desert to protect and assist the traveller and to supply him with his requirements. Consequently I hope that the explanation which I have given will serve to remove suspicion (literally “ what has come into the minds ”) and to assure of the good intentions of the Government of H. M. the King. ( 16 ) {Received on 13th March 1937 with Political Secretary's letter No. 8, dated 25th February 1937.) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter, dated 22nd February 1937.

His Majesty the King of Iraq, of the one part, and His Majesty the King of Saudi Arabia, of the other part; being desirous of consohdating the brother ly relations obtaining between their two Arab Kingdoms, and of defining the treatment to be enjoyed by nationals of the two high contracting parties in regard to residence, possession of movable and immovable property, judicial matters, taxation and imposts ; and, in fulfilhient of the purpose aimed at by article 12 of the Treaty of Arab Brotherhood and Alliance signed at Baghdad on the 10th day of Muharram-al-Haram, 1355, a.h., corresponding to the 2nd day of April, 1936, a.d. Have agreed to conclude a Residence and Passport Agreement, and have appointed as their plenipotentiaries :— His Majesty the King of Iraq : His Excellency Saiyid Naji-al-Asil, Minister for Foreign Affairs; His Majesty the King of Saudi Arabia : His Royal Highness Amir Feisal, Minister for Foreign Affairs; Who, having exchanged their powers, found in good order, have agreed as follows :— Article 1. The subjects of either of the two high contracting parties shall enjoy in the territory of the other party treatment not less favourable than that enjoyed b y nationals of the most favoured States in regard to entry and residence, acquisition and possession of movable and immovable property, taxation, imposts and like matters, and all judicial matters, provided that neither party24 ehall have the right, under the present article, to claim for his nationals from the other party more favourable treatment than that accorded by him to the nationals of such other party. Article 2.

Letter from Minister, Jedda, to Foreign Office, No. 327, dated 11th January 1937. Jedda, December 21,1936. The operations of the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate (Limited) in this country have, it is believed, progressed steadily since the last reports on the subject were rendered by Mr. Calvert in his despatches No. 225 and No. 267 of the 28th July and the 12th September respectively. Little has been heard j -v of the developments in the operations at Wejh, and as regards the progress at the Maod-ad-Dhahab, information has not so far indicated that any suc cessful outcome to their operations is yet in sight. It is understood, however, that a water supply, inadequate for all the purposes of the mine, but never theless in a useful quantity, has been discovered, but it would appear that the syndicate are still sanguine of the ultimate success of their operations from their activity in completing their “ terminal ” headquarters at Jedda, which are expected to be ready for occupation by the end of Feburary next, and in * pushing forward the work on the projected jetty, to which a reference was made in paragraph 371 of Jedda report for November last. 2. Mr. Twitchell has, during the past few weeks, been otherwise engaged than in directing the present operations of the syndicate, for, according to a reliable report, he has recently visited Riyadh, accompanied by one of his principal geologists, Mr. Larken, and by Mr. C. L. W. Bindloss, the engineer in charge of the syndicate’s transport organisation. At Riyadh Mr. Twitchell, who is expected to return to Jedda shortly, is stated to have been negotiatingan extension of the area of the Saudi-Arabian Mining Syndicate’s present concession. It may be presumed that the new area is that for which Colonel Etherton and Colonel Micklem unsuccessfully sought a mining concession last month (see my despatch No. 315 of the 7th December), an area in which may lie the legendary Najadeh gold mine, of which mention has been made in pre vious reports, and the promising Jebel Hilit district, which lies just outside the limits of the present concessionary area of the syndicate. My informant said that, as part of the price of a new concession, Mr. Twitched was prepared to offer to build a first-class motor road from Riyadh to the Hejaz for which undertaking the syndicate already have the necessary road making machinery in the country. 3. It is now possible to confirm that the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate made a loan, of an unknown amount, to the Saudi Arab Government during the summer of 1936, as reported in Jedda despatch No. 268 of the 12th Sep tember last. A member of the syndicate’s staff recently stated that the Saudi Arab Government were finding it difficult to fulfil the condition to liquidate this loan in monthly payments. 4. Copies of this despatch are being sent to the Department of Overseas Trade and Transjordan. ( 18 ) {Received on 6th March 1937 with Political Secretary's letter No. 7, dated 18th February 1937.)

Letter from Foreign Office, London, to Under Secretary of State Colonial Office, No. E. 7835/2617/91, dated 15 th February 1937. ’ With reference to Conclusion (e) of the 48th meeting of the Middle East (Official) Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence, held on the 14th December 1936, by which the Colonial Office and the Foreign Office are invited to pursue the question of British Consular representation in the Yemen, I am directed by Viscount Halifax to state that, as the result of a careful examination of this proposal in the Foreign Office, a number of serious objections have become apparent. 2 . In the first place, were the King of the Yemen to admit British Consular representation he would not be able to refuse the same treatment to the Italian Government. It seems more than probable that the result would be a race in which each Government would strive to outstrip the other in the size and influence of its Consular establishments, and that His Majesty’s Government would either have to meet the expense involved in maintaining a more im posing establishment than the Italian Government or stand by and see the Italian Government acquire precisely that position which it is desired to pre vent them from acquiring. ^ 3. But in any case the recent refusal of the Imam as reported by His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad in his despatch No. 616 of the 31st December last (a copy of which was sent to you in the Foreign Office letter E-362 / 34/93 of the 4th February), to consent to the establishment of an Iraqi Diplomatic Mission either at Hodeida or Sanaa suggests that it is most unlikely that he would agree to the establishment in his country of British Consular offices Even if he were to give his consent, it would probably be long before a Consul’ on whose doings a fierce light would from the start be directed, could live down the suspicion with which he would be regarded and evolve an alternative system of intelligence and reporting of equal efficiency to that by means of which the Residency at Aden at present obtains information regardino- events in the Yemen. ° A ° 4. In the second place the establishment of Consular representation in the \ emen presents difficulties from an administrative point of view, since the climate and living conditions are such that special conditions of service 55(C) ExAffairaDept.26 I would be necessary, while the fact that frequent changes of officers would be inevitable wouldbe liekly to detract from the satisfactory performance of the difficult duties which the officers would have to carry out if the post were to have any value at all. 5. In view of the foregoing considerations Lord Halifax considers that it would, in present circumstances, be preferable not to pursue the suggestion further and would be glad to learn whether Mr. Ormsby Gore is in agreement with this view. 6 . Copies of this letter are being sent to the Admiralty, War Office, Air Ministry, India Office and Treasury. (19) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter dated 27th February 1937. Letter froiu Foreign Office, London, to the Right Hon’ble Sir Ft?™ Drummond, Rome, No. 182, dated 24th February 1937. The Counsellor of the Italian Embassy called here on the 3rd Februarv m order to discuss Anglo-Italian relations in the Red Sea area He said that the Italian Government had been rendered uneasy at the recent journeys of Captain Seager (the British frontier officer on the Aden-Yemeni frontier) from Aden to Sana a and of Mr. Philby to the Hadhramaut. Signor Crolla seemed rather confused about these journeys and at times spoke of Mr Philbv’s 3 M Ur S t( V th , e CO A St of r the Persian Gulf where ’ as was explained to him. r. 1 hilby had not been for many years. But it appeared that the reference to these journeys was merely intended to introduce the subject, and that the real object of his visit was to say that Italy relied entirely on and held firmly to the Borne understanding of 1927, and to express the hope that His Majesty’s Government themselves were prepared to continue equally to base themselves on that instrument. , T . 2 : 8i « nor Crolia ; vas in reply that it must be self-evident that His Majesty s Government could have no ambitions in the Arabian peninsula and and no wish to increase their responsibilities by adopting any kind of forward po icy beyond the areas already under their sovereignty or protection Their policy, as the Italian Government must know, was the maintenance of the uKilUS QUO* 3. As regards the journeys to which Signor Crolla had particularly alluded Captam Seager was, as the Italian Government were aware, the Brdish fron tier officer on the Aden-\emem frontier. His Majesty’s Government had no representatives m the Yemen, but the fact that they lid a common frontier' with that country naturally led to the necessity for discussing various frontier questions of common interest. In the circumstances it seemed entire^ natural that Captain Seager should go to Sana’a from time to time the ordinary course of his work as a frontier officer, in order to keep in ’contact with the Y emem officials. As regards Mr. Philby, it was no doubt univer sally believed abroad that he was a British agent, but it must be sufficiently obvious that such activities as his recent incursion into the Aden Protectorate were hardly those of a British agent. Signor Crolla was then given a brief account of Mr. Philby’s career, and told that the Italian Government should not be misled by the ridiculous reports to which Mr. Philby’s adventures inevitably gave rise. He eventually said that the Italian Government were under no misapprehension on this point and did not take Mr. Philby seriously conversation^^ am ’ h ° Wever ’ wh - v he had referre d to him at the outset of the ... tf ® ig . n °&lt; r £ r ° 1Ia Was thcn toW that &gt; while it seemed fairly clear that His Majesty s Government could have no conceivable object in attempting to extend their responsibilities in Arabia, the position was not so simpffi “f regards Italy. Italy made no secret of having embarked on a forward policy and whatever the attitude of the authorities in Borne might be it couM not be denied that there had been a great deal of loose talk in local Italian military27 and naval circles about the obvious strategic advantages which Italy might obtain if she secured a foothold in the Yemen. It was no doubt unnecessary to attach excessive importance to such remarks, but this kind of talk had unquestionably created a great deal of uneasiness in certain quarters. 5. Signor Crolla said that any such uneasiness was entirely unjustified. Italy had her hands more than full in Abyssinia, and the last thing she wanted was an Arabian adventure. In any case, her policy was to adhere firmly to the undertakings of the Rome understanding of 1927, and he wished to give a formal and categorical assurance to this effect. The Italian Government for their part had, he repeated, certainly felt some uneasiness at Captain Seager’s journey. There had been reports to the effect that he had discussed with the Imam the possible cession or lease of certain points on the Red Sea Coast. These rumours, though' they were unconfirmed, had given rise to much sus picion as to the attitude of His Majesty’s Government. Signor Crolla was told that these stories were entirely ridiculous. It was just as much to the interest of His Majesty’s Government as to that of Italy to adhere strictly to the undertakings contained in the Rome understanding. The last thing which His Majesty’s Government could have contemplated was to have attempted, in violation of those undertakings, to obtain any cession or lease of bhis sort from the Imam, even if there had been any prospect of the Imam considering such suggestions. In any case. Signor Crolla could regard what was being said to him as a formal assurance that nothing of the sort had ever been contemplated, and that such action would be entirely contrary to the basic principles of the policy of His Majesty’s Government in Arabia, which were the strict maintenance of the independence and integrity of the two Arabian States, that is to say of Saudi Arabia and the Yemen. Signor Crolla, after expressing appreciation of this assurance, said that he felt that the detente in Anglo-Italian relations ought to be extended to the middle East as well, and that he w r ould like to see the Rome understanding of 1927 developed. He was given no encouragement to pursue this line, but he went on to explain that the Italian Government attached importance to the observance of the provisions in the Rome understanding for Anglo-Italian consultation. 6 .

Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter dated 14th April 1937. Letter from Minister, Jedda, to Foreign Office, No. 27, dated 22nd March 1937. Jedda, February 28, 1937. In accordance with the instructions conveyed in the last paragraph of your telegram No. 135, dated the 5th December, regarding Mr. Philby’s expedition into the Aden Protectorate, I had the honour to send you, in my telegram No. 9 of the 22nd February, an outline of Mr. Philby’s attitude. I now transmit a full summary of statements which he made to me in the course of a conversation on the 18th February. The collapse of his motor transport and, later, heavy floods delayed his return so long that he had only a few hours in Jedda before leaving for Mecca for the pilgrimage, but during that short time he called at the Legation and he talked freely about his journey. 2. As I anticipated, Mr. Philby was in his most heroic prometheus mood. Indeed, he was even more difficult than I had expected, for to his desire to bring the light of science to mankind is now added a quite ferocious intention to expose the alleged duplicity of His Majesty’s Government towards the Arabs of the peninsula. He asserts that the second part of this programme w T as added only under the provocation which he considers he received from the Aden authorities. I did not enter upon a discussion of the pledges given or alleged to have been given in respect of Arab independence. I had never studied the McMahon correspondence closely from the point of view of the Arabian peninsula, and, in any case, it would be unwise to treat Mr. Philby as the protagonist of the Arab claims. Moreover, I had in hand the less ne bulous argument that Shabwa lay outside the extreme limits ever claimed by the Saudi Government. Mr. Philby’s attitude towards that fact is shown in paragraph 6 of the enclosed record. He professes to demand independence for the Arabs in the Arabian peninsula without regard to the Saudi demands, of which he, however, claimed to be fully aware. He informed me that he had on his maps the two proposed frontiers in the south, the British and the Saudi. In that case, he was aware before he set out for Shabwa that it lay heyond the limits claimed by the Saudi Government. 3. Mr. Philby is unable to see that he treated Ibn Saud badly in obtain ing an escort for topographical work and exploration in Saudi Arabia and using it, unknown to his patron, to enter territory outside Saudi Arabia. As to the Aden authorities, he regards their claim to Shabwa as a trespass on territory which was abandoned by His Majesty’s Government in favour of Arab independence in the McMahon correspondence. In that corres pondence His Majesty’s Government agreed to recognise “ the independence of the Arab countries ” within the limits laid down by the Sherif Hussein, which included the whole of the Arabian peninsula except Aden and, possibly, the Arab States On the Persian Gulf, but they added the proviso: “ without prejudice to the existing treaties with Arab Chiefs.” Probably Mr. Philby would say that His Majesty’s Government had no treaty then and have none now with the Arab Chief of Shabwa, and regard that as the last word on a subject of great practical and legal complexity. I assume that the observations of the Chief Commissioner of Aden on Mr. Philby’s claims will be recorded in due course. At first sight it seems to me that there is just enough truth in Mr. Philby’s contention to afford a moral shelter behind which he can indulge his personal tastes and feelings and interests to the full. 4. Mr. Philby’s claim that from the political point of view his expedition was on all fours with that of Mr. Bertram Thomas is unfounded. It is true that Mr. Thomas was at the time in the employ of the Sultan of Muscat, but he had no official escort, and the Sultan had never given reason to anyone29 [bio © to suppose that he wished to increase his territory. Moreover, the whole of Mr. Thomas’s route lay to the east of the blue line which at the time of the McMahon correspondence represented the legal western boundary of the ter ritories of those Arab Chiefs on the Persian Gulf with whom His Majesty’s Government had treaties. Mr. Philby would probably say that the Turks had no authority to agree to the blue line, which took no account of their defeat at » the hands of Ibn Saud, but he does not know that Ibn Saud has recently ad mitted that His Majesty’s Government saved him from being crushed by the Turks. This admission was made in the message transmitted through Sheikh Yusuf Yasin which I reported in my despatch No. 283, dated the 11th October. But in any case, Mr. Philby could not be expected to forgo an opportunity ' to use Mr. Thomas as a stick with which to beat His Majesty’s Government. 5 . The statements recorded in paragraph 5 of the enclosure left little doubt in my mind that Mr. Philby did enter the territory of the King of the Yemen, and since he cannot accuse the King of encroaching on Arab territory, he win' have to find another excuse for the encroachment which the King rightly resented. But he will probably think the purity of his intentions sufficient excuse. ^ 6. Mr. Philby does not seem to have entered the band of territory lying between the proposed British and Saudi lines, but he may have gathered some information about it. In recent discussions with Fuad Bey I have claimed it for Aden and Oman on the ground that the four wells in it which are shown on our maps, viz., Sanau and Thamut in the Hadhramaut hinterland and Shisur and Tadhau in the hinterland of Oman, are not on Fuad Bey’s list of Murra wells, have never been claimed by the Saudi Government by name, and, ac cording to the information in Thomas’s Arabia Felix, lie to the south of the Rub-al-Khali and in the steppe country which rises from the rim of the desert to the crests of the coastal range and are frequented almost exclusively by tribes to whom Ibn Saud lays no claim. It is unlikely that Mr. Philby has collected any better information on this point than Bertram Thomas, « who passed through the territory in question and halted at Shisur, but he may make it more difficult for Ibn Saud to renounce his claim by representing the tribes thereabouts as entirely beyond the control of the authorities in the coastal States, but ready and willing to submit to Ibn Saud. Ibn Saud is so much more a statesman than Mr. Philby that I am hopeful that nothing Mr. Philby can say will influence him in this matter, the more so as, having repudiated responsibility for the expedition, he can hardly quote the results to his own advantage. I am more anxious lest the appearance of the promised attack on His Majesty’s Government in Mr. Philby’s next book should drag the question of the smaller Arab States in the Arabian peninsula into the vortex of controversy about the McMahon correspondence. 7 . I do not propose to engage in a dispute on pan-Arab politics with Mr. Philby, nor to continue the discussion about his visit to Shabwa. The views of His Majesty’s Government have been conveyed to the Saudi Govern ment, and Mr. Philby has also been informed of those views, and the matter had better, I suggest, be left there. 8 . I am sending copies of this despatch and its enclosure to Aden, Cairo Jerusalem, Bagdad and Bushire. Enclosure to letter No. 27, dated the 22nd March 1937. Summary of Statements made by Mr. Philby about his Expedition to Shabwa and beyond, in the course of a Conversation which he had with His Majesty's Minister on February 18, 1937. It was quite true that Ibn Saud had nothing to do with the expedition beyond instructing all local officials to assist him. Mr. Philby had defrayed all the expenses himself (and they had turned out to be much heavier than he had expected), though he had financed himself by drawing on Saudi trea suries, where they existed, and refunding the advances through his firm 55(C) ExAffairsDept.30 m Jedda. The object of the journey was purely scientific, and he had, in fact, collected a great mass of information which he hoped would be of use to science, and had established the position of over a hundred points. Through out the expedition the only connexion he had had with Ibn Saud was that, as a matter of courtesy, whenever he was within reach of a Saudi telegraph station he sent a telegram to the King reporting the date of arrival and the probable date of departure. 2. To show that the journey had originally no concern with politics, he could state that he had written all he had intended to say about the Hadhra- maut before he started back from Shibam, i.e., before the breakdown of one of his cars compelled him to go to Mukalla to try to get a new back-axle. The chapter was colourless, in spite of the fact that he had “ seen a lot of things ” about which he might have written. But after the reception he received when he applied to the Resident at Aden for assistance he had changed his mind. Having been attacked, he proposed to defend himself, and he would add chapters to his forthcoming book which would tell the world the facts about the Aden Protectorate. He was prepared to give His Majesty’s Minister all these facts, but he also proposed to give them to the Saudi Gov ernment. 3. The criticism directed against his visit to Shabwa was entirely un justified. His journey was on all fours with that of Bertram Thomas across the Rub-al-Khali. He was quite right in claiming that, apart from the Hadhramaut, his journey lay in unexplored, undemarcated territory. To claim Shabwa and those parts for the Aden Protectorate was fantastic, for no protection was afforded. Nor could the Aden authorities claim the virtue of leaving the people thereabouts to manage their own affairs, for they bombed them. The Aden attitude towards Shabwa was exactly like that of the Italians towards WaJwal at the beginning of the Italo-Ethiopian dispute, and British policy was no more honest than that of Italy had been. The British were trying to expand at the expense of the Arabs. 4. His policy remained what it had always been, viz., to try to obtain for the Arabs what they were promised early in the Great War. He had chal lenged His Majesty’s Government to publish the promises made then (the McMahon correspondence), but with their habitual cowardice they had re fused. There were plenty of copies in Arabic to be had, but the English correspondence ought to be published. He would tell His Majesty’s Minister a “ secret he used to possess copies of the correspondence in English, given to him by T. E. Lawrence, but they were stolen from him by a clerk of his in Jedda. 5. He was interested to hear (for the first time) that the King of the Yemen had protested to Ibn Sand, alleging that the expedition had entered Yemen territory at Jauf and Marib. He wondered how the King had heard about it. In point of fact, he had not gone to Marib, but had taken photo graphs and bearings from a height from which it was visible. (Mr. Philby evaded, or at least did not answer, the question whether the height in question was in Yemen territory.) 6 . No, it was not quite correct to say that he was asking for more for Ibn Saud than Ibn Saud was asking for himself, though it was near the truth. What he wanted was the establishment of the promised Arab independence in the Arab Peninsula and the elimination of any foreign rule which conflicted with the promises. Mr. Philby claimed to know all about the British and Saudi proposals for the southern frontier of Saudi Arabia and to have the two lines marked on maps in his possession. When His Majesty’s Minister said that in that case he must have known that Shabwa lay well to the south of the proposed Saudi line, he said that the position of Shabwa on the map was a long way out, but he did not deny that Shabwa was even farther to the south than the map shows, and therefore at a greater distance from the extreme limits claimed by Ibn Saud than appeared from the map.31 ( 22 ) Letter from the British Embassy, Cairo, to the Right Hon’ble Anthony Eden, No. 420, dated the 2nd April 1937. I have read with much interest the record, contained in your desnatch No 1S2 (E. 784/27/91) of February 24th [S. No. (19)] to Rome, JfTdrSon at the foreign Office with the Counsellor of the Italian Embassy on Feb ruary 3rd regarding Anglo-Italian relations in the Red Sea area. 2 . I note that according to paragraph 5 of that despatch Signor Crolla was informed that the basic principle of the policy of His Majesty’s Govern- 1 j. ai 1 ^ was strict maintenance of the independence and integrity or Saudi Arabia and the Yemen. I have assumed that what was intended was the maintenance of the independence and integrity of these states as against a European power and that the statement made to Signor Crolla was m fact nothing more than a confirmation of Clause 3 of the Rome Under standing of 1927. I raise the point merely for the purpose of elucidation since the sentence in question is capable of the meaning that His Majesty’s Government are prepared to maintain the independence and integrity of the two Arab states in question as against each other—an attitude which would involve a departure from the principle underlying Clause 3 of the Rome Understanding. Jedda' ^ am Senc ^ n ^ a C0 Py espatch to His Majesty’s Minister at Enclosure 1 to S. No. (22). Letter from Foreign Office, London, to Sir Miles Lampson, Cario No. 444, dated the 22nd April 1937. I have received Your Excellency’s despatch No. 420 (486/1/37) of 2nd April [S. No. (22)] in regard to a discussion at the Foreign Office with the Counsellor of the Italian Embassy on 3rd February regarding Anglo-Italian relations in the Red Sea area. 2. The assumption in paragraph 2 of your despatch is correct. It was not my intention to imply that His Majesty’s Government are prepared to maintain the independence and integrity of the two Arab States in question as against each other. 3. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s Representatives at Jedda and Rome. (23) {Received on 22nd May 1937 with Political Secretary's letter No. 18, dated 6th May ’1937.) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter dated 26th April 1937. Letter from Minister, Jedda, to Foreign Office, No. 38-E., dated 5th April 1937. Jedda, March 11, 1937. I have the honour to submit a few remarks on the financial situation of I bn Saud and its effect upon policy. 2. In the recent monthly reports sent in from this post reference has been made to the determined efforts displayed by the Saudi authorities to collect money otherwise than by taxation, not only from their own subjects but also from pilgrims. The Aviation Society has pubhshed regularly in the press during the last few weeks and appeal to pilgrims urging them to subscribe for the defence of their fatherland, the Holy Land of the Hejaz Then there is the Piastre Scheme, whose main object seems to be the encourage ment of local industries. The committee in charge of this project have32 gone so far as to publish in the Saut-al-Hejaz newspaper an appeal to Moslems written in ill-spelt English, and to advertise small boxes of dates for pilgrims to take home as “ A Present from Medina Other objects for which subs criptions are invited are the sacred well of Zamzam, the Waziriya water scheme for Jedda, the First Aid Society, the Charitable Society, the Asylum for Orphans and the Aged, and so on. The pilgrim guides are required to press these schemes upon the attention of their pilgrims, and for the Aviation Society the guides are under moral compulsion to buy books of 1 riyal tickets proportioned to the number and supposed wealth of their pilgrims, and are left to pass them on to the pilgrims if they can, or to bear the loss themselves. Pilgrims have been subjected to pressure on behalf of these various schemes, but no complaints have been received from British pilgrims. It is accepted that a pilgrim should distribute what he can in charity while he is in the Hejaz, and if there were no societies appealing for his money, it might go to individual beneficiaries or be extorted under various pretexts by the guides. 3. It is easy to deride the thirst for money which underlies these appeals, and the latest Jedda report contrasts the requests for charity with Ibn Saud’s alleged expenditure of over £600 for walnuts and pistachio nuts for his last hunting trip. But it is impossible not to feel some sympathy for him. His personal expenditure is doubtless wasteful in some ways, and it seems hard on a poor country to have to support a royal family, which includes twenty- five princes and a corresponding number of princesses and queens, but there is no reason to think that any economy that would be compatible with the King’s position and oriental methods of accountancy would make a great difference to the budget. 4. The word “ budget ” is only used by convention, for it is porbable that the Saudi budget exists largely in the head of the able Nejdi, who is Ibn Saud’s Minister of Finance. Income is irregular and incalculable, and expenditure spasmodic. If the King wants money suddenly for some purpose the Minister of Finance must produce it somehow, and there are demands from the Amirs Saud and Faisal also to be met, and the simplest way to meet essential expen diture is to leave for some future time the payment for services rendered or goods supplied. All Saudi officials, except those who are in position to look after themselves, are permanently in arrears with their pay for periods ex tending at times to half a year. Many foreign chauffeurs, employed for the State cars, have been glad to recover, before leaving, a third or a quarter of arrears of pay extending back sometimes for two or three years. The Soviet Legation are still trying, apparently with no hope of success, to recover payment for oil products to the value of about £30,000, which they supplied to the Saudi Government in 1930. A Polish firm supplied a considerable quantity of arms to the Saudi Government m 1930, and it is believed that the efforts they made to recover the second half of the price were not successful. The difficulties which have beset our attempt to recover the cost of arms supplied by the Government of India at the time of the Nejd rebellion in 1929, are only too well known to His Majesty’s Government. Although con siderable sums have been collected from pilgrims during the last two months, there are the usual signs of financial stringency. The Legation even had to appeal to the good offices of the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs for payment of the balance due to the Eastern Telegraph Company (Limited) for the period ending the 31st January ; the Saudi Government paid £1,000 and left over £2,000 outstanding. 5. The main difficulty is that in spite of his policy of economic develop ment Ibn Saud is still dependent almost entirely, either directly or indirectly, on the pilgrimage as a source of revenue. It is nearly a year now since there seemed to be ground for hope that oil would shortly be discovered in Hasa in commercial quantities, but this hope has not been fulfilled, though it is true that it has not been abandoned. The Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate have discovered a gold mine, or rediscovered an old one, with gold in what would ordinarily be paying quantities, but the water which would make it possible to work the mine on an economic basis has not yet been found. The Petroleum Development (Western Arabia), (Limited), which has begun to prospect for oil along the coastal belt of the Red Sea has no good news toreport. It is true that the prospectors have not been at work long, and it must also be remembered that an American company found oil at Bahrein where the Shell Company had given up the search, but the reports from the com pany’s experienced geologists, who seem to have covered most of the ground, nave left the Jedda manager very gloomy. Two other possible sources of wealth can be foreseen at present: that oil will be found in the Rub’-al- Khali, and that somewhere in such parts of Arabia as are not included in the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate’s concession gold or some other valuable mineral will be found in quantities and in conditions that will repay the work ing. There can be little in the commercial schemes which are discussed in the Mecca press from time to time. It is not by selling to pilgrims small boxes of Medina dates that the Saudi budget will be made to meet at the back, nor by curing rather less badly the few skins the country has to export. Several grandiose schemes, which in succession raised Saudi hopes, have come to nothing. The chief of these were the Jedda-Mecca Railway, the Saudi State Bank, which the ex-Khedive was supposed to be prepared to establish, and the loan of half a million or so which the Saudi Government hoped they could raise in England on rather vague security. 6 . For the present, then, the Saudi Government are living on the pil grimage revenues supplemented by windfalls, such as advances in respect of the various concessions, the purchase by the Italian Government of an unknown number of camels at absurdly high prices, and consignments of arms, petrol, &amp;c., for which they have never paid. Thus, windfalls apart, Saudi Arabia is dependent upon a source of revenue on which not even the Hejaz alone had to live before the war, for there seems to be no doubt that the Ottoman Government put into the Hejaz, in the way of subsidies and in over head expenses, more than they ever got out of it. The country being depen dent upon the pilgrimage, the size of the pilgrimage is of the first importance. The fluctuations of this manifestation of religious enthusiasm are well known to you. The total of overseas pilgrims this year was about 50,000. In 1927 it rose to 132,000, and in 1933 it fell to 21,000. The number of pilgrims falls in times of economic stress, but it is also affected by national policy and social changes, as in Soviet Russia, Turkey and Persia. No Soviet citizens, and very few Turkish now come on the pilgrimage, and the number of Per sians is diminishing. Statements made recently in the course of conversa tion by members of the Persian and Afghan Legations in Jedda suggest that their Governments regard the pilgrimage as a useless drain upon the national resources. On the other hand, it seems likely that the increasing feeling of Arab solidarity will help to maintain, if not to increase, the number of pilgrims from Egypt, Syria and Palestine and perhaps Iraq, while in Moslem countries under European rule not only will the authorities be careful not to take any action which might be interpreted as interference with the pilgri mage, but nationalist feeling will probably tend to encourage the pilgrimage by using religious to supplement political feeling. But it seems unlikely that the average number of pilgrims will increase to such a point as to enable Ibn Saud to reduce the oppressive pilgrim dues, which he would doubtless be glad to do not only because he would be exposed to less criticism, but for religious reasons too. 7. I have redrawn above the familiar picture of Ibn Saud searching year after year for normal sources of revenue, and thrown back time after time on the most invidious, viz., levy of toll upon Moslems making the pilgrimage to the shrine of Allah. It would not be surprising if this disposed him to class his country with the “ have-nots ”. And it happens that with the exception of the Yemen, which he refrained from annexing in 1935, partly out of consi deration for pan-Arab feeling, but partly no doubt for fear of Italy, he sees around him on the Arabian Peninsula more than one territory which he could absorb but for His Majesty’s Government, and whose absorption would be to his economic advantage. This does not apply to the south, for whatever political attraction the Hadhramaut may have for him, it contains no obvious form of material wealth. But on the Persian Gulf the situation is different. There is one small sheikh in possession of the fine natural harbour of Koweit and a pearl fishery, and in far too favourable a position for smuggling into Saudi territory. Another sheikh so small that Ibn Saud always refers to him by a 65(C) ExAfFairsDept34 familiar nickname, not only claims the whole of the Qatar Peninsula, including a hill that Ibn Saud particularly wants for himself, but has granted an oil concession like an independent sovereign. Running down the coast are various insignificant people whose only purpose in life seems to be to bar Ibn Saud from the sea, from any oil that may be discovered there, and from any pickings that might be got out of Imperial Airways. Finally, there is Bahrein, which used to belong to Ibn Sand’s ancestors but now stands more or less on its own feet, and which, moreover, has an oil well gushing away as if in mockery of the miserable seepings in the wells which have been bored in Hasa. And in all these territories His Majesty’s Government have “ interests ” which prevent their being absorbed, as much to their own as to the general advantage, in Saudi Arabia. Such is the picture which Ibn Saud may be expected to paint to himself. 8 . In these circumstances it is reasonable to suppose that although Ibn Saud seems to have decided that on the whole His Majesty’s Government are to be preferred to the Italians as freinds, the recognition of our interests in Arabia puts a great strain upon a monarch who is not only ambitious but probably insolvent too. It might be argued that the poorer Ibn Saud is the less likely he is to engage in a policy of adventure, but my own opinion is that on the whole a more generous view is justified, viz., that anything that in creases his legitimate revenue is to be welcomed by His Majesty’s Govern ment, and any expenditure that might embarrass his finances is to be depre cated. To increase his revenue is not in our power, for without giving pil grims money, as the Italians have done this year for propaganda purposes, we can hardly do more to facilitate the accomplishment of the pilgrimage by British pilgrims than is done already. We can, however, apply the second principle to any scheme which comes up for consideration. In my despatch No. 20, dated the 10th February, I applied this principle to the suggestion that His Majesty’s Government might perhaps help in the reconstruction of the Saudi portion of the Hejaz Railway, and opposed it chiefly on the ground that the railway would be a fianancial liability to Ibn Saud and not an asset. If it could be shown that the railway would not be a burden on Saudi finances, the proposal would, I think, deserve reconsideration. The principle enters into the consideration of other questions affecting the relations of His Ma jesty’s Government with Saudi Arabia, but it is unnecessary to go into details here. (34) {Received on 22nd May 1937 with Political Secretary's letter No. 18, dated 6th May 1937.) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter, dated 29th April 1937. Letter from Minister, Jedda,'to Foreign Office, No. 40, dated the 12th April 1937. Jedda, March 23, 1937. Mr. Rendel’s tour in the Near and Middle East brought him to Jedda ^ on the 17th March, a few days after Ibn Saud’s first appearance in Jedda since my arrival at this post last September, and when I presented Mr. Rendel to him I had myself only seen him once, a few days before, and that only for a short call such as was paid by all the foreign representatives in Jedda. It was to be expected that Ibn Saud would wish to use this opportunity to speak of various matters affecting the relations between His Majesty’s Government ^nd Saudi Arabia and after we had had two meetings on current questions with Sheikh Yusuf Yasin and Sheikh Hafiz Wahba we were invited to call on His Majesty for a conversation on matters of mutual interest. This re sulted in three meetings lasting some two hours or more each, and a fourth which might have lasted as long had not Mr. Rendel been obliged to leave to catch his steamer for Egypt. 2 . Fuad Bey had left Jedda unexpectedly a few days before Mr. Rendel’s arrival. The alleged reason for his departure at a moment when the presence of the Deputy Foreign Minister might have been regarded as essential was the health of his little boy, about whom he professed to be exceedingly anxious, but information from other quarters does not bear out the plea that the childwas seriously ill, and it may be that his jealousy of Sheikh Hafiz Wahba, the Saudi Minister in London, who would naturally be present at any interviews accorded to Mr. Rendel, made him glad to leave, and that the King, who per haps does not trust him fully, was glad to let him take a holiday. During one of our conversations the King mentioned with emphasis as the three men he trusted Sheikh Hafiz Wahba, Sheikh Yusuf Yasin and his son Faisal, the Minister for Foreign Affairs. The Amir joined the group on two occasions, the other two were present throughout. From statements made during the conversations, I am forced to conclude that I have been misled by Fuad Bey on one or two points, and for this reason, and also because of the general pro- Italian reputation which he has acquired, it is impossible to believe that conversations such as we had could have been as full and as frank had Fuad Bey been present. 3. The lavish hospitality which Ibn Saud always displays to guests threatened to assume an alarmingly public character in Jedda. We were embarrassed to discover that not only were dinners to Mr. Rendel to be given by the King and the Amir Faisal—festivities which might be taken as a rea sonable return for hospitality enjoyed by the Amirs Saud and Faisal in Eng land—but a dinner was to be given by Sheikh Abdullah Sulaiman, the Minister of Finance. At our request the third dinner was cancelled, but it was re placed by a tea-party, which was attended by the King. The personal character of the party was, however, emphasised by the presence of Mrs. Rendel. The King made a very rare exception to his rule not to receive European ladies, and had her placed in the seat of honour on his right. 4. Not only did we endeavour to avoid some of the external signs of an official visit, but Mr. Rendel was careful to explain, both at the beginning of his visit to Jedda and also just before his departure, that his journey was personal and private. It was undertaken, he explained, in resjjonse to the generous invitation of His Highness the Amir Saud. Nevertheless, he had taken the opportunity to study carefully on the spot various matters affect ing Anglo-Saudi relations, in particular the Qatar boundary, and he would be glad if he could assist in arriving at a settlement of this or of any other outstanding question. 5. At my urgent request Mr. Rendel took the leading part whenever there was a question of explaining the point of view of His Majesty’s Govern ment on matters of importance. This was not only reasonable in that he was merely going again over ground covered on many occasions with the Saudi representative in London, but there was the even more cogent reason that Ibn Saud would certainly expect to hear the views of an official of the Foreign Office who, to his knowledge, had dealt with Saudi affairs for many years. I venture to believe that Mr. Rendel’s visit and the conversations to which it gave rise have been of the greatest value, and will have helped to launch my personal relations with His Majesty under the happiest auspices. Cer tainly nothing could have been more cordial, friendly and familiar than the King’s words and manner, which never changed, however delicate the point under discussion, and it was interesting to learn from my new Italian col league, with our interviews fresh in my mind, that he had found the King extremely guarded, and concluded that he was an extremely clever fellow* who would never commit himself. 6 . I am fully conscious of the danger that excessive cordiality at the beginning of an acquaintance may lead to disappointment later on. As I informed the Foreign Office in personal letters soon after my arrival, I found that the King regarded me, on the strength of quite normal official letters written by me to King Hussein in 1923-25 and discovered in the Shereefian archives after the fall of Jedda, as a partisan of Ibn Saud’s, and I regretted this assumption, since the oriental builds far too much upon personalities and the King might expect to gain impossible favours from His Majesty’s Government through my efforts and might afterwards be more dissatisfied at failure than if he had never entertained any hope of success. Similarly there is the danger that he may build too much upon Mr. Rendel’s visit, and may hope to influence His Majesty’s Government in matters where it is not possible for them to make concessions or grant favours. But it is sufficient36 to keep this danger in mind. On the whole I am sure that the cordial conver sions have been of very great value. 7. The subjects discussed during Mr. Rondel’s visit were these: — (1) With Sheikh Yusuf Yasin and Sheikh Hafiz Wahba : — (а) Qatar frontier. (б) Transjordan frontier. (c) Koweit blockade. (2) With the King, Sheikh Yusuf Yasin and Sheikh Hafiz Wahba being present :— (a) The general relations of Saudi Arabia with His Majesty’s Gov ernment (this includes the Qatar frontier and relations with the Persian Gulf rulers in general). {b) Relations of Saudi Arabia with Italy. (c) The Yemen (with the Italians in the background). (d) Iraq (with the Turks in the background). (e) An appeal for assistance from His Majesty’s Government (not ^ dealt with in detail except to^some extent in regard to aviation). (/) Palestine. These questions, which frequently overlapped each other in the course of the conversations, will be dealt with in detail by telegram or despatch. 8 . Copies of this despatch are being sent to Cairo, Jerusalem, Bagdad, Bushire and Aden. (25) {Received cm 22nd May 1937 with Political Secretary's letter No, 18, dated 6th May 1937.) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter, dated 30th April 1937. Letter from Minister, Jedda, to Foreign Office, No. 41, dated the 12th April 1937, Jedda, March 23, 1937. In my despatch No. 40, dated the 23rd March, I reported that during Mr. Rendel’s short stay in Jedda, from the 17th to 22nd March, we had several interviews with His Majesty King Abdul Aziz. I now have the honour to enclose a summary of these conversations. The conversations themselves and unavoidable hospitality occupied most of the time during the last two and half days, so that there was not time to make a complete record before Mr. Rendel’s departure. 2. It might have been more satisfactory to divide the record up into ^ portions according to the various subjects discussed, and to send each portion separately with a covering despatch, but there is not time to do this before the bag goes, and in any case the subjects overlap a good deal. Where com ment seems to be called for I hope to send it by the following bag, and the question of Palestine, at any rate, requires a telegram. 3. In two or three places I have inserted material which may appear to be remote from present-day politics, e.g., references to Ibn Saud’s relations with the Sherif (later King) Hussein and to his dealings with British officials in the Persian Gulf before the war. I think these references are relevant as showing that the mind of the King is always roving back to the times when, as he thinks, he deserved well of His Majesty’s Government and reflecting that he has got precious little out of it. I am not saying, at the moment, that any bitterness that Ibn Saud feels on this score is justified but only that it exists. 4 . I have been more than six months at this post, but it was not until now that I could come into contact with the man who directs foreign affairs, as he directs everything else in Saudi Arabia. The peculiar position in which foreign representatives are placed in this country is familiar to you, but itmay be of use to illustrate it from my short experience. T arrived at Jedda in the middle of last September, and presented credentials to and dined with the Amir Feisal, a purely nominal Minister for Foreign Affairs, who at once re treated to the hills of Taif. The Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, Fuad Bey, was on leave, and did not return until towards the end of November, and for two months I saw no none connected with foreign affairs except the King s secretary, Yusuf Yasin, who came to Jedda at the end of September to arrange for the exchange of notes about the Treaty of Jedda and connected matters, communicated a long statement from the King about foreign affairs, and retired to the other side of Arabia. Between the return of Fuad Bey towards the end of November and his hurried and surprising departure on leave a few days before Mr. Rendel was due to arrive, I have had occasional interviews—sometimes at tiresomely long intervals—with Fuad Bey, whom there is reason to think that the King does not entirely trust, and who I think has misled me on one or two occasions. 5. I may mention that during the course of the conversations reported in the enclosure the King twice said that he hoped I would pay him a visit at Riyadh. For many reasons such a visit is not to be undertaken lightly, but it may be useful to have the invitation in hand if matters of importance have to be dealt with and no satisfaction can be obtained here during the long interval between two successive annual visits of the King to Jedda, the only place in Saudi Arabia where a foreign representative is allowed to reside. 6 . I am sending copies of this despatch and enclosure to Cairo, Jeru salem, Bagdad, Bushire and Aden. Enclosure to letter No. 41, dated the 12th April 1937. Record of conversations in the course of interviews granted by His Majesty King Abdul Aziz to Sir Reader Bullard and Mr. Rendel on March 20, 21 and 22, 1937. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin and Sheikh Hafiz Wahba were present throughout, and the Amir Feisal appeared on two occasions. Sheikh Hafiz Wahba and Sir Reader Bullard interpreted. First IntervieWy March 20. The King began by laying down the pirnciples which governed his life : (1) his religion, (2) his determination to keep his name above reproach, and (3) devotion to his religion and to the interests of his subjects. He was a self-made man, having started with nothing in the world, and provided that he stuck to his principles he was prepared to go back to nothing. Times were changing, the pristine honesty of the world was declining, but he would never pursue a crooked path. He believed in consulting everyone, but no one could lead him by the nose. He would always speak to His Majesty’s Government frankly and sincerely. All sorts of stories were afloat about his subservience to the Italians, but he could assure His Majesty’s Government that they were nonsense. Mr. Rendel said how much the King’s frankness was appreciated by members of the Government in Great Britain, and Sir Reader Bullard said that he was sure that the King was never suspected by His Majesty’s Government of subservience to Italy, and that His Majesty’s Government knew that his policy was directed to what was their object as well as his, viz., the maintenance of the independence of Saudi Arabia. 2 . Ibn Saud said that he was a Moslem first of all, but he believed that of all the European Powers the one with whom it was to the advantage of the Arabs everywhere to be on good terms was Great Britain. After some talk on these lines Sir Reader Bullard took the opportunity to convey the thanks of His Majesty’s Government for the advice which the King had given to the Mufti of Jerusalem when the mufti appealed for his help recently (Foreign Office telegram No. 12 of the 1st March). The King expressed pleasure at this mark of appreciation of his efforts and repeated what he had said to the mufti (he had advised him to co-operate with the British in maintaining order and to await the result of the Royal Commission), and he said that he had 55(C) ExAffairsDeptalso warned the mufti not to let himself be made an instrument for Italian intrigues. He went on to say that he wanted the whole “ bundle ” of Arab states to be on good terms with His Majesty’s Government. He was not thinking of Palestine for the moment; that question was being considered, and he trusted that a solution would be found that would be satisfactory to His Majesty’s Government, to the people of Palestine, and to the Arabs in general. No, he was thinking of danger which threatened the Arab world in two places, the Yemen, and Iraq. 3. First the Yemen. The Yemen was in a ferment. The whole country was against the heir apparent. Ahmad, while the Imam said “ yes ” to every one, but did nothing. When three of the sons of the Imam came on the pil grimage recently, Sayyid Husain spoke to the King about the situation in the Yemen and asked for his advice. If there was a revolt in the Yemen, what w'ould be the attitude of (1) Ibn Saud, and (2) the Italians ? According to Sayyid Husain—and Ibn Saud knew it to be true—the whole population without exception hated Ahmad and the Foreign Minister, Raghib, a Turk who is in Italian pay. They had asked for the removal of Raghib, but he was protected by Ahmad. They had sent the Imam a written protest (here the King gave us a copy), but without effect. If they were free they would revolt and sweep away both Raghib and Ahmad, and the Imam too if he opposed this popular movement. 4. To this enquiry from Sayyid Husain, Ibn Saud said he had replied that, as for himself, he proposed to observe a policy of complete neutrality and non-intervention in Yemen affairs. He had withdrawn once when he might have occupied the Yemen, and he did not propose to reverse that policy. If there should be trouble in the Yemen, the most he could do would be to consult other Arab countries if asked by both sides to try to make peace, and to see what could be done to give effect to the request. As to Great Britain and Italy, Ibn Saud had told Husain about the Rome understanding of 1927, and had said that both the British and the Italians had assured him that it was their firm desire that the independence of the Yemen should be maintained. In conclusion, Ibn Saud declared vehemently that there must be an outbreak in the Yemen—perhaps before the death of the Imam. In that event, what would the Italians do and what would be the attitude of His Majesty’s Government ? 5. Mr. Rendel replied that His Majesty’s Government fully appreciated the dangers of the situation in the Yemen. There was no doubt that the Italians had been, and still are, intriguing actively in that country and would be very ready to fish in the waters they had helped to trouble. But while the internal situation was perhaps more dangerous than it had been, he was inclined, for the following reasons and speaking purely personally, to doubt whether the Italian danger was now quite as acute as it had been a year ago. In the Rome understanding of 1927 His Majesty’s Government had made it quite clear, and the Italians had formally recognised, that His Majesty’s Government regarded it as “ a vital imperial interest that no European Power should establish itself on the Arabian shore of the Red Sea. ” (At this point Sir Reader Bullard gave King Ibn Saud, for convenience of reference, a copy of an Arabic translation of the relevent text, which had already been com municated to His Majesty by Sir Andrew Rayan.) There was, of course, no reason to trust any Italian promises as such, but it was obvious that, in view of the terms of the Rome understanding, any attempt by Italy to estab lish herself in the Yemen would be a direct challenge to His Majesty’s Gov ernment. No doubt Italian hot heads, possibly Italian local officials, cherish ed designs on the Yemen. But Italian policy would be directed from Rome, and present indicatons suggested that for European reasons, and in view of British rearmament, Italy was not now anxious to embark on any conflict with His Majesty’s Government, but was rather seeking to establish better relations. Even if this view should prove mistaken, he did not think King Ibn Saud need be seriously disturbed by Italian activities in the Yemen. Saudi and British interests were closely parallel, and it was difficult to see how any development which threatened Saudi independence could fail equally to threaten British interests, so that the probability was that, in any such event, Ibn Saud would, in any case, find Great Britain at his side. At a later39 interview the opportunity was taken to mention that the Italians themselves seemed anxious to keep the Rome understanding alive, and apparently feared a forward policy on the part of His Majesty’s Government (see Foreign Office despatch to Jedda, No. 182 of the 24th February). 6. Mr. Rendel added that he understood (from Sheikh Hafiz Wahba) that His Majesty wished to know the attitude of His Majesty’s Government . towards his suggestion for an exchange of information about the Yemen, &amp;c. Mr. Rendel saw no reason why this should not be possible. His Majesty’s Government would be glad to pass on to Ibn Saud any information of interest which they could properly communicate to him, though in doing this they would, of course, be assuming that Ibn Saud was satisfied that there would be no risk of leakage at the Saudi end. 7. Ibn Saud then turned to Iraq. He had good information, for people wrote to him from all parts of the Arab world and he had seen many Iraqi pilgrims, and the reports all tallied with each other. Everyone was suspicious of the new Iraqi Government and regarded it as not Arab. There had beert* much to be said against Yasin-al-Hashimi, who had even gone so far as to ask Sheikh Yusuf Yasin to tell Ibn Saud to beware of the British Govern ment, but at least his policy was an Arab policy. To the policy of the present Iraqi Government there were two objections : it was communistic, and it was under Turkish influence. The Turks had begun by trying to get possession of the Sanjak of Alexandretta, and their next aim would be to ac quire Mosul. 8. Mr. Rendel said that the title of Communist was sometimes misapplied to any one who favoured economic social reform. He understood that such reforms were long overdue in Iraq, where there was much extreme poverty, and it was possible that Hikmet Suleiman’s legislation was necessary, and was not imposed in any spirit of communism. It might be well, therefore, to reserve judgment on this point until the Amir Saud and Sheikh Hafiz Wahba should have seen the situation for themselves during their impending visit to Bagdad. (Here Ibn Saud said that Hikmet Suleiman did not care a rap for the poor or for anyone.) As to Turkish influence, Mr. Rendel believed that, while the maker of the military coup Bakr Sidqi, and some of his military associates, might be described as pro-Turkish, Hikmet Suleiman showed signs of wanting to shake himself free of military influence, and the longer he could maintain his Government, the more hope there was that he would become less dependent on the army’s support. As to the attitude of the Turkish Government, a year ago Mr. Rendel would have scouted the sug gestion that Turkey might embark on a policy of adventure. In this opinion he had been seriously shaken by Turkey’s Alexandretta policy, but the Turks had not “ got away with it ” over Alexandretta, and they had, he thought, felt themselves much isolated at Geneva and had retreated fro m the extreme position they had taken up. The fact that the Turks had received so marked a check over Alexandretta ought, he felt, to make them much less likely to put forward any other similar claims in future. Second Interview, March 21. 9. Ibn Saud said that he wanted to make some remarks under four heads :— - ! (1) His relations with His Majesty’s Government. T , (2) The Arabs in General. (3) Palestine. (4) The future. The interview went on for over two hours, but never got beyond the first head. Ibn Saud went over the whole course of his relations with His Majesty’s Government from the moment when he first entered into communication with them through the Political Agent at Bahrein, and suggested that their common interests demanded that the Turks should not be allowed to establish them selves strongly in the Arabian Peninsula, and received an assurance that His Majesty’s Government would not allow the Turks to approach him either by sea or through Koweit. He recited his dealings with Sir Percy Cox during40 the war, recalled the loyalty with which he had offered to help the Sherif Hussein against the Turks, and spoke of the “ guarantees ” which he had received from Sir Percy Cox. Nothing whatever had come of these “ guarantees,” though he had been promised “ all sorts of things. ” He had assisted the Arab policy of His Majesty’s Government by communicating to them the written and oral offers which he received from the Turks as an inducement to him to join them against Hussein—offers which he refused, alleging that he could not move against the British because they were his neighbours on the Gulf, and saying that, in any case, he could not join the Turks when they were slaughtering Arabs. At first he even told His Majesty’s Government that he would accept Hussein as King of the Arabs, but later he was obliged to withdraw this offer. He told Hussein that the resources in money and arms which were supplied by the British were being wasted through being dealt out to the various sheikhs according to the number of followers they said they had, and asked that, if be sent his son and some men to help, they should only be given arms for themselves and food to eat, and Hussein had replied that Ibn Saud must be either mad or drunk. Ibn Saud thereupon informed the British Government that he must lay down two con ditions : that he would not recognise Hussein as King of the Arabs, though he did not object to his being King of the Hejaz, and that when the war was over His Majesty’s Government should allow him to settle his own scores with Hussein. He had always listened to the advice of His Majesty’s Government, even to his own hurt. On more than one occasion he had fallen out with his chief supporters, the Ikhwan, for that reason, e.g., when he retook Turaba which the Sherifians had unjustly occupied, and His Majesty’s Government asked him not to go any further ; when he refrained at the request cf His Majesty’s Government from taking Aqaba, where the ex-King Hussein was staying, and Maan ; and when he listened to the mediation of the British agent at Jedda and ensured the peaceful occupation of the city to the disappoint ment of some of his followers. For all this loyal support, and after all the promises made to him, what had he got ? Nothing whatever. On the contrary ! 10. He would put his complaints under three heads {a) His Majesty’s Government had not given him the help he needed. (b) Their boundary policy was always squeezing him in. (c) By their Gulf policy they tried to make him dependent commercially on Koweit and Bahrein. Whereas a friend in need of help looked to a more powerful friend to assist him, he had had no help from His Majesty’s Government. Look what His Majesty^ Government had done for Egypt and Iraq ! Those countries might be richer than Saudi Arabia, but Saudi Arabia could, in his opinion, be more useful than either to His Majesty’s Government. 11. After expressing great interest in the valuable historical survey which the King had given, but pointing out that what we had to adopt as a basis was the facts of to-day, Mr. Rend el suggested that one difficulty was that, whereas countries like Egypt and Iraq, which contained rich natural resources, could be developed by commercial enterprises which would earn their own profits, Saudi Arabia did not at present appear to be economically in that category. If, however, Ibn Saud had any particular kind of help in mind and would specify what it was, he could be sure that the suggestion would be considered very carefully. Ibn Saud said that there were all sorts of help that he might mention, but he would speak first of aviation, to which he attached great importance. He had sent to His Majesty’s Minister through “ that man ” (pointing to Sheikh Yusuf Yasin) a suggestion about the training of Saudis in aviation in Great Britain. As to the Italians, he swore as a Moslem and an Arab that when the Italian aeroplanes arrived, he wished that Allah would destroy the machines and the men in them. Mr. Rendel reminded the King that the failure of other countries to follow our example in reducing armaments had compelled us to rearm, and that the expansion of the British air force was employing to the full all our resources for the manufacture of aeroplanes and the training of men as pilots and mechanics, and that, while41 this should tend to deter other nations from disturbing the peace of the world and should therefore be of advantage to His Majesty, it made it more difficult than it would otherwise have been to give His Majesty direct assistance in matters of aviation. Nevertheless, if His Majesty would make specific suggestions, they would be examined most carefully and sympathetically. 12. The subject was again referred to at a later meeting the same day. Mr. Rendel repeated his warning about the peculiar difficulties created by the pre-occupation of His Majesty’s Government with their scheme of rearmament, and spoke of the necessity for co-ordination of skilled men with suitable machines if time and money spent on training and equipment were not to be wasted, and of the possibility that Saudi Arabia, having a very small urban popidation among which to find men with a suitable preliminary training in mechanical work, &amp;c., might find it more difficult than, e.gr., Egypt, to pro duce suitable candidates for aviation work. Sir Reader Bullard suggested that, whereas it might suit the Italians to undertake the training of any number of Saudis because of the political effect it might be expected to have. His Majesty’s Government would be reluctant to embark on any scheme that would not have a reasonable chance of success. He also asked the King what ^ His Majesty thought would be the effect upon the Italians of any close rela tionship between His Majesty’s Government and Saudi Arabia in matters of aviation. Was there any reason to think that this might encourage them to seek to extend their influence elsewhere, e.g., in the Yemen ? It was true that the Italians had themse’ves wished to identify themselves closely with Saudi Arabia in aviation affairs, but how far was that merely a phase of the war with Ethiopia and their hostility to His Majesty’s Government on that point ? The King said that the Italians still wished to be allowed to develop Saudi aviation, and implied that he didn’t care what they thought. He added bitterly that the pilots trained in Italy were no good. At one point in the conversation the King said that if Iraq shook itself free of Turkish influence he would not mind having some Iraqis to help in aviation later on. 13. It was arranged that Sheikh Yusuf Yasin should prepare for His Majesty’s Minister a note of the Saudi requirements in aviation matters. This note, Ibn Saud was assured, would receive the most careful attention. Third Interview, March 21. 14. The King said that he wanted to speak about his future in relation to His Majesty’s Government. He began with a long and rather pointless account of the negotiations for the Saudi-Iraq Treaty of Friendship and Alliance. In so far as it has a point it was intended to show the Iraqis as rather slippery customers. At Riyadh, said the King, Naji-al-Asil suggested to Ibn Saud that Iraq should deal with His Majesty’s Government in the matter of Palestine on behalf of Ibn Saud, and that Ibn Saud should deal with the Imam about his adhesion to the Saudi-Iraq Treaty. Ibn Saud had expressed surprise at this request, and had said that both States must ^ act together in both matters. He spoke of what appeared to be a similar attempt to side-track him in the matter of securing the adhesion of the Imam to the treaty. He then spoke of the surprise he had felt at the Iraqis wanting to insert in the treaty a reference to the League of Nations, of which Saudi Arabia was not a member, and added that the Imam would never consent to sign anything in which there was a reference to the League. Mr. Rendel explained that members of the League could not assume any obligation which might be incompatible with their existing obligations under the Convenant, and that they were therefore bound to make a reservation to that effect in any treaty involving military assistance, &amp;c. Moreover, Iraq was also bound by the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of Alliance, which, as His Majesty’s Government had pointed out to the Iraqi Government, involved a similar reservation on the part of Iraq. Mr. Rendel said that, of course, such a reservation would not affect a party not a member of the League, and that consequently neither Saudi Arabia nor the Yemen would be affected by such a reservation on the part of Iraq. 15. The King then said that he had often been asked whether th^ States of the Persian Gulf could not adhere to the Saudi-L 65.Cl ExAffahsDept42 had fended off such enquiries, alleging the unimportance of such States, but he would be glad to know the opinion of His Majesty’s Government. Mr. Rendel reminded His Majesty of the position of His Majesty’s Government in the Gulf. They had had relations with the Arab rulers there in some cases for as long as a century and a half, having been compelled to take action in regard to gun-running, piracy, the slave trade, &amp;c. As a result, as had been made clear at the time of the Treaty of Jedda, the foreign affairs of Koweit, Bahrein, Qatar and the Trucial Sheikhdoms were in the hands of His Majesty’s Government, who exercised sovereignty over them in those affairs and there fore could not allow them to enter into treaty relations with any foreign State. Ibn Saud seemed to accept this statement without demur. 16. This subject led to the question of the frontiers. Mr. Rendel repeated the arguments which he used with Sheikh Yusuf Yasin on the 19th March, saying that His Majesty’s Government had made great concessions in this respect, whereas His Majesty was holding firmly to his original demand. In the northern part of the eastern frontier there remained nothing between the parties but the Jabal Naksh and Khor-el-Odeid, with perhaps an adjustment in the Sufuk (Safaq) region that might go some way towards meeting the ) King’s wishes. Could not His Majesty make some concession here ? It would make an excellent impression on the Foreign Office if he could. Ibn Saud repeated his familiar statement that the whole of the coast belonged to his ancestors and that the present rulers would not deny it. Koweit, for instance ; all the tribes living in Koweit were really Saudi tribes. It was true that he had recognised the treaties between the coastal rulers and His Majesty’s Government in the Hadda Agreement, ( 1 ) but on the question of the boundaries there was a limit beyond which he could not go. The boundary of Qatar was w^ell known to be Araik, which was in the nufud. 17. The maps which wnre at hand were examined, but Araik was not marked on them. Sir Reader Bullard said that he had seen a map on wffiich, unless his memory was at fault, Araik was shown to the south of Jabal Naksh. In that case there w^ould no longer be any disagreement on that point. 18. As to Khor-el-Odied, Ibn Saud said that, in claiming it for Saud Arabia, he w^as thinking of the interests of His Majesty’s Government as much as of his own, for no one but himself could keep order there. When crimes were committed there it was to him that the people applied for redress. 19. The King seemed very anxious to pass on to another subject. It appeared at first that he w r as wanting to evade the boundary question, but when the other subject came to be broached it was found to be a question of capital importance. What, the King asked, would happen to him in the case of war ? Suppose war began in Europe, or in the Yemen or anywhere ? Could not His Majesty’s Government make some treaty or some other lesser undertaking with him ? It could be secret if they wished. 20. Mr. Rendel said that any such undertaking, and more especially any kind of secret guarantee, was precluded by the British constitutional •’j system, which w^ould in any case make its eventual fulfilment uncertain. Sir ' R. Bullard added that His Majesty’s Government were obliged, as members of the League of Nations, to register all treaties with the League. Mr. Rendel then went on to say, as he had said the previous day, that he could hardly imagine any occasion on which a, threat to Saudi Arabia would not be a threat to His Majesty’s Government, and added that this community of interests was a stronger bond than many a treaty. We had given too many promises in the past, under pressure of war in particular, and could not give one in this case. Sir Reader Bullard reminded the King once more of the terms of the Rome Agreement of 1927. His Majesty’s Government had recorded in writing that they regarded it as a “ vital imperial interest that no European Power should establish itself on the Arabian shore of the Red Sea”. The King seemed to derive comfort from this conversation. Fourth Interview, March 22. 21. The King said that in this the last conversation before Mr. Rendel’s departure he wished to speak about Palestine. The Arabs were now really 0) Tliis reference should be to Article 6 of the Treaty of Jedda.43 alarmed by the Zionist policy. They feared that a Jewish Government would be established in Palestine and would include Transjordan in its scope, and they were even beginning to fear that there might be designs on Medina itself, the burial-place of the Prophet Mahomed. Some of these fears might be exaggerated, and due to irresponsible talk by individual Jews, but there was also genuine ground for apprehension, and he himself was very anxious about the question. Great Britain was powerful and could crush the Arab opposi tion, but he feared that there might be dangerous repercussions in other Moslem countries in which His Majesty’s Government had special interests, e.g., Egypt, Iraq and India. There were many enemies watching for an opportunity to injure Great Britain. The chief of these was, of course, Italy. The attempt that Italy was making to win recognition as the friend of Moslems in general and of the Arabs in particular was well known. The Italians had used the pilgrimage for propaganda purposes, and had done their best to induce him to speak in praise of their pro-Moslem policy. He had resisted this attempt, and he had no belief whatever in Italian professions, for he knew what had happened in Tripoli and in Abyssinia, but there w^as a real 0 ^ danger from the Italians, nevertheless, if the troubles in Palestine should ^ flare up again. Nor were the Turks inactive. They had many agents in Palestine, who never failed to rub it into the Arabs that the result of their revolt against the Turks was subordination to the Jew T s. The Zionist policy, as it was being carried out at present, was contrary to British interests, and that was one reason why he was against it. As a Moslem and an Arab he naturally sympathised with the Arabs of Palestine. He had suppressed these personal feelings hitherto out of friendship for His Majesty’s Govern ment, and he could always suppress his feelings if policy required it. But the Zionist policy was not even in the interests of Great Britain. Moreover, His Majesty’s Government must realise that he stood alone, and that he had to think of his position in a Moslem world where he was the butt of much criticism, and where many of his co-religionists would not even admit that he was a Moslem. He felt that he had come to the end of what he could do in the matter of Palestime. 22 . His Majesty was assured that his views would be communicated to His Majesty’s Government without delay. 23. Ibn Saud said that he had one last question. Suppose that there was trouble in the Yemen and the Italians asked him about it, as they might very well do ; what should he say ? Should he reply to this effect:— He did not propose to interfere in the internal affairs of the Yemen, and the Rome understanding of 1927, the relevant part of which had been communicated to him by the Italians as well as by the British, seemed to require them both to adopt a similar attitude of non-inter vention. Mr. Rend el said that this reply seemed to meet the circumstances exactly. * ( 26 ) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter dated 30th April 1937. Letter from Minister, Jedda, to Foreign Office , No. 44, dated the 12th April 1937. Jedda, March 25, 1937, In the summary of conversations with IbTh Saud which I had the honour to submit as an enclosure to my despatch No. 41, dated the 23rd March, the question of the Yemen was referred to in paragraphs 3, 4, 5 and 23. I now transmit a summary of the document which the King handed to me when we were dealing with this subject. The document is a multigraphed copy of a typewritten original in Arabic, in the form of an open letter to the Imam. I understood from Ibn Saud that the letter had been distributed widely in the Yemen. It urges the Imam to designate his son Husain as his successor,44 instead of Ahmad, and to begin now to train Husain for the task of govern ment. There is a pan-Arab touch in the request that two Moslems from Syria, Egypt or Iraq should sit on the Council of Notables whose formation is recommended. In so far as foreign interference is referred to, it appears that the British are placed on the same level as the Italians. 2 . Ibn Saud spoke with great earnestness about the certainty that trouble must break out in the Yemen on the Imam’s death, if not before. The open letter assures the Imam that a revolt will break out before his honourable coffin has reached the cemetery. The open letter might be a piece of pro paganda for Husain with nothing behind it, for all I could tell, for I have little direct knowledge about the Yemen, but Ibn Saud was doubtless telling the truth when he claimed to be very well informed. He referred to the Wazir family as being with the rest of the Yemen against Ahmad. It will be remembered that Muhammad-al-Wazir came on the pilgrimage this year. He shared to some extent in the honours paid to the three sons of the Imam by Ibn Saud. 3. I am sending copies of this despatch and enclosure to Cairo and Aden. Enclosure to letter No. 44, dated 12th April 1937. Summary of the Contents of an Open Letter addressed to the Imam Yahya and signed “ The Loyal Tongue of the Nation ”. The Imam’s rule has been partly good and partly bad, but his piety has caused, and still causes, his people to overlook the bad things and to be loyal to him and to his house. However, times are changing and men with them, so he would be well advised to listen to franlky uttered counsels. He wishes his son Ahmad to succeed him. Such a succession would be disastrous, for Ahmad is incapable of governing ; in such an event the people would be dissatisfied, and, on the death of the Imam Yahya, they would rise in armed revolt. The agreements entered into with England and Italy, with a view to strengthening Ahmad’s position, would prove valueless. The writer then advises the Imam as follows :— (1) To consult the Amirs, Ministers and officials as to the man they consider a suitable successor to the Imamate. It does not follow, of course, that they will speak their minds freely. (2) To proclaim A1 Husain as bis successor and initiate him, in the Imam’s lifetime, into the work of government with the assist ance of a council of notables. Among the members of such a council should be two Moslem leaders or upright men from Syria, Egypt or Iraq. This would be welcome to the people who consider A1 Husain an honest and pious man, and would mean the frustration of foreign designs. (3) To persuade Ahmad to surrender his rights for the common weal and recompense him by giving him the Amirate of Hejah, with the revenues thereof, on condition that he takes his orders from the capital, (4) To promote unity among his sons and send some of them to Egypt to be educated at Al Azhar or some other institution, under the supervision of tutors appointed by him and by the Egyptian Government. Haste is urged in putting these suggestions into execution, and the Imam is told that his adherence to the Saudi-Iraq Treaty will strengthen the Yemen ; thus there is no need to fear foreigners. The importance of his recognising Al Husain during his lifetime is stressed once again, as is the importance of Al Husain’s travelling in Egypt, Syria and Iraq in order that he may see how foreign countries are ruled.Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter, dated 10th May 1937. Letter from Minister, Jedda, to Foreign Office, No. 46, dated the 19th April 1937. Jedda, March 27, 1937. To complete the record of the conversations with Ibn Sand which was sent to you as the enclosure to my despatch No. 41 dated the 23rd March, I have the honour to transmit translations of two documents :— {1) A letter from Sheikh Yusuf Yasin in reply to a letter which I had written to him in the sense of paragraph 17 of the record. I had said that a map in our possession showed Araik as between Qasr-as-Salwa and Jabal Naksh, and had asked whether His Majesty’s definition did not leave Jabal Naksh to Qatar, but Sheikh Yusuf Yasin’s letter does not admit my contention, and implies that there is another Araik (Uraiq) between Jabal Dukhan and Jabal Naksh. (2) A note in which Ibn Saud amplifies statements made by him, in the course of the conversations, about his position in regard to the Arab rulers on the Persian Gulf. 2. The questions referred to in these enclosures will be dealt with separately. 3, Copies of this despatch and enclosures are being sent to Cario, Jeru salem, Bagdad, Bushire and Aden. Enclosure 1 to letter No. 46, dated the 19th April 1937. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin to Sir E. Bullard. (Translation.) Dear Sir Reader Bullard, Jedda, March 23, 1937. The moment I received your Excellency’s letter of the 23rd march, 1937, I hastened to put right the point which your Excellency raised. In the inter view I had in haste with your Excellency at your house just before noon on Tuesday, the 10th Muharram (22nd March, 1937), I explained to you that I did not believe that His Majesty the King, in his conversation to which you referred, meant A1 Ureyq but Dukhan. There was a slip of the tongue. After I left your Excellency I enquired of His Majesty concerning the actual fact, and His Majesty stated that he did not intend that place, which is south of Naksh, but the one which is south of Dukhan, which makes Naksh within the Saudi * Arab Kingdom. During the conversation His Majesty did not think of giving up the claim concerning the frontiers put forward by the Go vernment of His Majesty. His Majesty’s statement was accidental and did not concern the details of the case. The question was not one of discussing the exact position of the frontiers, and I therefore think the question still stands where it did. Enclosure 2. Note by Ibn Saud amplifying his Statements abend his Position in regard to the Arab Eulers on the Persian Gulf. (Translation.) I have spoken clearly about the historical stages in the relations between me and the British Government, all of which have been courteous and consis. tently amicable on my part, and sometimes on the part of the British. But 55(C) ExAffairsUept46 what filled me with misgiving, much annoyed me and affected my honour are the two following points :— (1) The question of the frontiers of Qatar, Oman and other principa lities of the Gulf. (2) The question of trade and marine transport. As regards the first point, these territories themselves, as you are aware, were under the suzerainty of my ancestors, and until the time of my grand father, Faisal, paid an annual tax for the preservation of the relationship of vassal to overlord. But in view of our desire for the continuation of our friendship with the British Government and the said Amirs to whom we are bound by old ties, we have recognised their positions in the Persian Gulf and their principalities, and have respected the treaties between them and the British Government. But it never entered my head that this could be a resaon for taking away a part of our territories and annexing it to those territories at a time when every one admits that the peace which those places enjoy is due to God and to us. It is not reasonable that such pressure should be due to suspicion of us or to doubt as to our intentions or our friendship, or to the accusation that we covet a territory which is ours. For the covetous man does not covet a mountain or an inlet ; he covets rather a densely populated country. What we care for is the protection of our honour and the defence of the rights of our subjects and tribes. As to the question of trade, I know that ships call at, and carry goods and all kinds of merchandise to, ports on the Persian Gulf which are less important than mine, and I who count myself the oldest friend of Britain and the greatest of the Arabs am placed at the mercy of Koweit or Bahrain ; and whenever the question is raised, it is said that it is one for the shipping companies. I did not believe that friends could treat each other in such a cruel manner. Praise be to God who granted me and my country more power than that of Koweit, Bahrain and Abu Dhabi, &amp;c. Why should ships call at those places and mine suffer deprivation in that no ships call there ? I hope you will, as you have stated, consider the situation as it is and a veil will be drawn over the past if its mistakes can thus be corrected. Other wise you may inform me of the real reasons. I have summarised in this letter what I have told you at length in my conversation. March 23, 1937. m Telegram from Sir R. Bullard, Jedda, No. 48, dated the 29th April 1937.

In continuation of my despatch No. 327 of December 21st last, I have the honour to inform you that the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate (Ltd.) have not as yet been successful in discovering a supply of water adequate for the purposes of the Madh-adh-Dhahab mine. However, they appear to be con fident of ultimate success for they have been accelerating the work on the Jedda “ terminal ”, and also on the jetty which now projects some distance47 into the sea. Moreover a member of the Syndicate’s staff stated in conver sation that Mr. John Park, who holds a watching brief for the operating com pany, has a staff engaged on full pay in the United States of America ready to take over. According to another informant, however, the Sydicate cannot hope to produce gold for some three years yet. No public transactions in shares of the Syndicate have been heard of, but Mr. Twitchell says that he has sold some shares “ at a good profit ”. 2. In March a prospector went off to explore the area towards the Transjordan frontier in the vicinity of the Hejaz Railway. He stated before leaving that he would in any case probably find coal, which would suit the company very well. His hopes, however, appear to have been over modest as at the end of April the Legation were credibly informed that the workings of an old mine, rich in ore, had been discovered at Araiq, north of Teima, where a nugget was found yielding seven ounces of gold. 3.

Render, Esqr., Foriegn Office, London, No. E. 3956/ 872/91, dated the 19th July 1937. Agnlo-Italian Relations in the Middle East. Signor Crolla, the Counsellor of the Italian Embassy, called on me this morning and said that he had been instructed by the Italian Government to raise the question of our policy in Arabia as it might affect Italy. As I knew, and as he had told me on February 3rd last, the Italian Government attached the greatest importance to the maintenance of the Rome Understanding of 1927. [S. No. (169) in F. 427 (ll)-N/26.] But since the date of that Understanding there had been many developments. Italy, owing to her conquest of Aby ssinia, occupied a more important position in the Red Sea area, and her interest were more deeply engaged and more widely extended there than they had been before. All that occurred in Arabia was thus of importance to her, and she had become, so to speak, much more “ sensitive ” in this area than in past. The Italian Government had therefore been disturbed by certain recent developments which suggested that His Majesty s Government might be adopting a more forward policy. 2. Signor Crolla began by alluding to the recent arrival at Jedda of two British aircraft, apparently to bring documents to Sir R. Bullard, and to Sir R. Bullard’s immediately subsequent departure for Riyadh to interview Ibn Saud. He had a long complicated story about reports current in Jedda as to the objects of this visit, which had made the Italian Government very un easy. Apparently realising that this was hardly a sufficient ground for the uneasiness which he had been instructed to express to R 16 * h® went on ~ alleging, however, that he did so entirely on his own initiative—that he had read in the “ Daily Herald ” about a month ago that we were extending our authority and influence north of the Hadhramaut, apparently with a view to establishing ourselves in the hinterland behind the \emen. His explanations were confused and confusing, but he seemed anxious to suggest that His Majesty’s Government were now adopting a much more forward policy in Arabia, and that Italy, in view of her increased interest in East Africa, could not remain unaffected or indifferent. 3. I began by telling Signor Crolla that it seemed to me increasingly difficult to deal with these constant unjustified suspicions on the part of the Italian Government, in view of the background of hostility and supicion which was being created by the perpetual attacks launched against every thing-we did by the Italian press. Hardly a day passed when I did not read in my telegrams of some new and utterly unjustified misrepresentation of our policy and motives in Italian newspapers. This was not my immediate concern, but it made it much more difficult to clear up local questions such as Ancrlo-Italian relations in Arabia and the Middle East, when one knew that whatever we said or did would be distorted and used against us in Rome. It made one despair of ever getting anything properly straightened out. 4. As regards Arabia, I could tell him at once categorically that we held firmly to the Rome Understanding of 1927 [F. 427 (11) N/26] and that we at tached oreat importance to its integral maintenance. It was clearly laid down in that Understanding that it was a mutual and important interest both of Italy and of Great Britain that no European Power should establish49 itself on the Arabian coast of the Red Sea. We had meticulously observed our own part of this Understanding, even to the extent of holding aloof in cases where we might have obtained a dominant position for ourselves in matters connected with Saudi Arabia. I hoped that the Italian Government would be equally scrupulous in keeping to their part of the Understanding, but I felt bound to say that the words and actions of certain Italians had done much to lend colour to the doubts which were felt in certain quarters here as to the ultimate intentions of Italy in regard to the Yemen. Our own policy was, however, perfectly clear and simple. We desired to see the independent Arab States remain independent and strong. We had no desire whatever to extend our influence beyond those limited spheres in Arabia in which we were legally entitled to exercise it, and any rumours to the contrary were merely malicious inventions. 5. As regards the particular cases to which Signor Crolla had alluded* I could tell him quite frankly what had been the object of Sir R. Bullard’s journey. As Signor Crolla knew, we were faced with an extremely difficult problem in Palestine resulting from our conflicting obligations. The Royal Commission had now produced a Report and recomendations, which might ^ well arouse strong feelings on both sides. We had felt it essential to ensure 4? that the Commission’s Report and recommendations should be clearly under stood by the leading personalities in the Arab world, and that there should be no risk of unnecessary misunderstanding owing to incomplete or inaccurate information. We had therefore decided to send Sir R. Bullard to Riyadh to explain the Report and recommendations of the Commission and the con clusions of His Majesty’s Government thereon frankly and accurately to King Ibn Saud the day before those documents were published in this country. This had involved Sir R. Bullard reaching Riyadh with the Report and con clusions of His Majesty’s Government not later than July 6th, and, seeing that the Report had not been in our hands until the evening of June 22nd, it had not been physically possible to arrange this without sending the necessary documents to him by air. I had myself been responsible for the proposal to send the two aircraft to Jedda, and had only hit upon this way of sending the papers to Sir R. Bullard after I had found that all the other methods of com munication would have been too slow. It was quite possible that Sir R. Bullard might take the opportunity of his visit to Riyadh to discuss any other outstanding matters with the King, but the object of his journey was perfect ly simple and straightforward, and it was absurd to read deep ulterior politi cal motives into it, or to represent it as implying any change of policy on our part. 6. As regards what Signor Crolla had said about our adopting a forward policy in the hinterland of the Hadhramaut and extending our authority round to the back of the Yemen, this was equally off the rails. There had been no question whatever of our extending our authority in this area. The boundaries of the Aden Protectorate dated from before the war, and from the days of the Anglo-Turkish Conventions about Aden of 1905 and 1914. This ^ applied also to the Arab States under British protection on the Arab coast R of the Persian Gulf, to which Signor Crolla had made an allusion. The legal boundaries of our sphere of influence both in the case of the Aden Protectorate and in that of our Arab protected States on the Persian Gulf were laid down in the two Anglo-Turkish Conventions of July 29th, 1913 [S. E. Dec. 1903, Nos. 1-245] and March 9th, 1914 [S. E. June 1914, Nos. Ti ll 5], and the relevant article was Article 3 of the latter Convention, which laid down the so-called blue and violet Unes. This Convention had been pub lished in Volume XI of Aitchison’s Treaties (1933 Edition, Volume XI, page 42). The legal position was still governed by it, and as regards the north-west frontier of the Aden Protectorate, the frontier had been confirmed by the Anglo-Yemeni Treaty of 1934 (Gmd 4630), Article 3 of which provided for the maintenance of the existing frontier. There had never been any question whatever of our extending our influence beyond this line, and the last thing we should contemplate doing was to penetrate beyond it and adopt a forward territorial policy in spheres in respect of which we had no legal claim. As regards the Aden Protectorate, which legally extended up to the “ violet line ” to the north-west, and up to a line running inland from Ras Dharbat50 AH on the east where it marched with the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman, our treaties with the various chiefs and leaders in the northern and eastern areas corresponded exactly to our treaties with the various chiefs and leaders in the south-western district. There was no difference between one part of the Aden Protectorate and another except that we had not in the past exercised any active control over the northern and eastern areas because there was no immediate reason to do so and they were difficult to get at. But now that the hinterland of Nejran etc., was being opened up and the influence of neighbouring Arab States was making itself felt, it was obviously necessary that we should ourselves establish our own authority within our own legal area. This did not imply any change of policy or any new departure. It was merely an internal measure within a sphere for which we were inter nationally legally responsible. 7. Signor Crolla asked whether we were not negotiating with Ibn Saud over the northern sphere. He alluded to reports of my having carried on negotiations myself with the King on this subject when I visited Arabia last March. I replied that there was no particular secret about the fact that discussions had been going on with King Ibn Saud for some time about a possible revision of the blue line frontier. Although this was the legal frontier, it had been fixed at a time when the country was Httle known, and there were now indications that some of the tribes who wandered to the east of the blue line did in fact come under Ibn Saud’s authority. The area was one of little importance and consisted almost wholly of uninhabited desert. We were therefore not inclined to insist too strongly on the legal line, and conversations had been proceeding in a desultory way with a view to some new Hue being agreed on. They were for the time being more or less in abeyance, and, as far as we ourselves were concerned, the area which was of most im portance to us was the coastal belt. But, however this might be, the fact remained that legally the whole area to the east and south-east of the blue and violet lines fell within our sphere of influence, and was internationally under our protection, with the exception of the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman, which was an independent State. Our actions in this area therefore could not possibly be regarded as involving any new policy or any departure from the spirit of the Rome Agreement. 8. I told Signor Crolla that I had given him this full and frank expla nation, as I wished to clear up any risk of misunderstanding and to try to convince him that our policy had not changed, and that we still held firmly to the principle of the Rome Understanding that no European Power should establish itself in independent Arabian territory. But I felt bound to add that the Rome Understanding really seemed hardly applicable to this area, since that Understading specifically referred to the Red Sea and to the Arabian Red Sea coast. The areas under our protection to the south-east and east of the violet and blue lines, which had nothing whatever to do with the Red Sea, therefore hardly seemed to come into the picture. 9. Signor Crolla replied that the Italian Government felt that the Rome Understanding of 1927 ought not to be applied in too narrow or local a spirit. In their view, it was important that there should be a clear understanding about British and Italian interests to cover the whole of Arabia and the Middle East. I asked Signor CroUa whether he meant by this—as he had at one moment seemed to imply—that the Italian Government wanted the Rome Understanding extended or amplified. I was unable to get a definite reply from him to this question, but he continued to say that it ought to be interpreted in the widest possible spirit. 10. Signor Crolla was not easy to follow, as he wrapped his ideas up in complicated language with a mass of allusions and implications, from which he showed great agility in retreating whenever I tried to hold him down on any particular point. My first impression was that he was trying to re present that we had violated the Rome Understanding and that Italy might therefore regard herself as free to adopt a forward policy. He did indeed at one moment hint at something of the kind. When he realised, however, how strong our case was for saying that we had scrupuloulsy observed theRome Understanding ourselves, he rather changed his ground and began, somewhat petulantly, to insist on how unjustified our suspicions were of Italian designs on the Yemen ; he had assured me over and over again, and particularly on February 3rd, in the most categorical terms that Italy had no intention whatever of adopting a forward policy in the Yemen or of violat ing the Rome Understanding. It seemed to him that, if it was a question of unjustified suspicions, our suspicions of Italy were more unjustified and seemed harder to allay than the suspicions which the Italians had entertained against us. I did not pursue this subject further, beyond making it clear that the Italians themselves had done much to shake our own confidence in them. The interview was, however, entirely friendly. 11. At more than one stage in the discussion I made it quite clear that His Majesty’s Government still attached very serious importance indeed to the principle enshrined in the Rome Understanding that no European Power should establish itself on the Arabian coast of the Red Sea. But in the absence of a final decision of the question whether some public state ment should be made on this point— a question which is still under const* deration—I avoided making any new statement about it which could commit us further than we are committed already.

I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your confidential despatch of the 24th May 1937 regarding the succession to the Sultan Sate of Mukalla, and to state that I shall discuss the matter with His Highness Sultan Salih' on his return to Aden, in the manner that you indicate. I do not yet know the date of his arrival, but I understand that it will be during the month of July. 2 . In the meantime Sultan Muhammad bin ’ Umar, son of the late Sultan ’ Umar and claimant under the Will of Sultan Awadh to the Sultanate of Mukalla, has arrived and is remaining here temporarily to press his case. He has not yet stated it fully but I have no doubt that he will base it not only on the Will of Sultan Awadh but also on the Agreement made between his father, the late Sultan L mar, and the present Sultan at Hyderabad in India on 24th June 1922, to which he has already referred in a recent letter to me. Copies of this agreement and of the Will of Sultan Awadh were sent to your predecessor as accompaniments to Major-General Scott’s despatch No. 67, dated the 16th May 1923. For convenience I propose to send you fresh copies of both the documents. 3. It will be seen that the Agreement of 1922, to which the present Sultan appended his signature, is of a very categorical nature, and it will be interest ing to see how His Highness proposes to justify his intention to dishonour it. It will be observed that although General Scott recommended on page 4 of his despatch of l(3th May 1923 that the Agreement should be recognised Q53 by His Majesty’s Government, no recognition was accorded : in the Duke of Devonshire’s reply in his despatch of 21st August 1923 he limited himself to approving the Resident’s proposal to recognise Sultan ’ Umar as successor to the late Sultan Ghalib and to continue to him the salute of 11 guns. No reference to the agreement was made in this communication. 4 . As I have previously indicated the hands of His Majesty’s Govern ment appear to me to be perfectly free in this matter, except in so far as they may consider it politically expedient to press any particular course of action. I shall therefore await Sultan Salih’s explanation of his proposals and of his reasons for them, as directed by you. 5. In the meantime I do not propose to enter into a discussion with Sultan Muhammad bin ’ Umar as to the rights and wrongs of this dispute, but to limit myself to taking note of any points that he may wish to put forward.

No. (29)], I have the honour to inform you that the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate, Ltd. now appear to have overcome the difficulties of supply ing water to the Madh-adh-Dhahab mine. It has been reported that an adequate supply of water has been discovered some forty miles from the mine, whither it is proposed to conduct it by pipeline : as the levels are not such that the water can descend to the mine by gravity, a good deal of pump ing will have to be done. This report would seem to be confirmed by the departure for England, towards the end of May, of Mr. J. F. Park, who re presents the interests of a prospective operating company. It was also announced in the London press that the formation of an operating company was foreshadowed at a meeting of the Mining Trust on the 18th May. 2. Meanwhile, prospecting parties continue their activities. Some old workings were discovered near Madain Salih, some thirty miles north of A1 Ula on the Hejaz railway. It is not clear if these workings are the same as those mentioned in paragraph two of Sir Reader Bullard’s despatch under reference. In any case, the Syndicate appear to be pessimistic as to the prospects of obtaining gold in commercial quantities in that area and the local press reports that the prospectors have “ finished their operations at Madain Salih ”. The Umm Qariyat mine near Wejh has now been finally abandoned ; but another mine has been located at Maraikib, near Yanbu\ which is stated to give promise of being a rich one.3.

Monsieur Pomeyrol worked for us last season in Saudi Arabia, and enjoys the confidence of the Company from all points of view. We therefore ask you to give us your necessary agreement to his employment in this capacity on the Trucial Coast. Monsieur Pomeyrol was born in 1904, studied and obtained his diploma from the Ecole Normale des Combustibles of Strasbourg, has done his military service, and has had experience in the Field in Chile, Syria and France. It is hoped that you will find no difficulty in according us the permission asked. The Company has not upon its strength, and is not in contact with, any geologist of equal capacity, of British nationality, who would be avail able for the work. Copies sent to Bushire and Bahrain.

Note by Sir R. Bullard respecting King Ibn Saud and the Italians. When I was at Riyadh Ibn Saud seemed to be more concerned than ever about the Italians. He referred to M. Mussolini slightingly as the “ Sw T ord of Islam,” but spoke wdth apprehension about his disposition to interfere in the affairs of other countries—now Abyssinia, now Spain or the Red Sea. He said that according to news from the Yemen the Italians were showdng great activity in the Red Sea and had recently landed men on Hanish Island and its neighbour. I reminded the King of what Mr. Rendel had said to him about the Italians and the Red Sea during his visit to Jedda, but he was only half reassured. I promised to keep him informed of any Italian move in the Red Sea of which we might become aware. The King said that only two or three nights before, the Italian wireless had again referred to the close interest taken by M. Mussolini in Moslem affairs. He quoted with amusement the neat rebuke administered to M. Mussolini by the Agha Khan when M. Mussolini claimed to be the protector of Islam, but said that in his opinion the Italian propaganda was dangerous. He heard about a year ago that the Grand Mufti of Palestine had accepted Italian help and immediately asked the Mufti whether the story was true.. The Mufti said that it was baseless, and that he would tell Ibn Saud the facts when he came on the pilgrimage. When he came to Mecca the Mufti assured Ibn Saud that he was not°even in touch with the Italians ; certain people who claimed them selves to be in touch with Italian circles had asked him why he did not accept Italian help, but he had refused to have anything to do with the Italians. As for himself, Ibn Saud did not even want to buy rifles from the Italians.55 . .u- l-nce a* which the Italian rifles were offered had now been reduced to 10#, go d, but he had said that as the rifles he already had were of other makes he did not wish to buy Italian rifles as that would be confusing for his army (huad told m e on another occasion that the excuse was not strictly true, as they already had in fact a small number of Italian rifles.) Ibn Saud said that if he took anything from the Italians they would want something in J’w'h- m ° r ‘ e ' % ehcit his 0 P ini °ns I played devil’s advocate. I said that His Majesty s Government were offering a stock of arms at a low price ; '^f 0 ^ H hey A '’m 6 so “ et &gt;nng in exchange ? No, said Ibn Saud ; the interests of Saudi Arabia and Great Britain were identical. And would not the Italians allege that their interests were identical with his? Ibn Saud in- ti ^'li * h i’u dnin t care what the Italians said. When all was said, the wt Br * tlsh ''•erethe best people. They were better than Italians, better than the Turks—better than the Arabs. He would even have preferred, from a purely Saudi point of view, that His Majesty’s Government should retain the mandate over Iraq. With the British as his neighbours he felt safe As an Arab and a Moslem he must sympathise with the adi ance towards Arab independence, but the independence of Iraq had created a situation which he viewed with grave anxiety. And now the British were going to give up their responsibility for Transjordan ! (42) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter No. P.

It was understood from the beginning that the em ployees of foreign missions in Jedda would not be interfered with in this respect, but a messenger attached to the California Arabian Standard Oil Company has been fined for a breach of the regulation. It is understood that a considerable sum in fines has been collected in Mecca, but that on at e j? st £ ne 0( -‘ cas ion the authorities were disappointed by a Javanese who after be]n g kept m prison and under observation for several days, was still without the rudiments of a beard and had to be discharged unpunished. ,i 3 * Most 1 J ava nese, in fact, sometimes through natural inability, but often fiom choice, do not wear beards, and the Netherlands Charge d’Affaires vho is himself a Javanese, recently visited Mecca to investigate this question* Ke was assured by the authorities that if any foreigners had been punished M^Wirltni T 1 ' r f gU ^io? J was thr °ngh a misunderstanding, and that if • Widjojoatmojo heard of the application of the regulation to a Nether- rectlLri lbj TE-^ ° n 7 t0 inform the authorities to have the mistake c titled. Jins decision is more generous than the regulation itself, which certainly applied to all Moslems, though as it has never been put in writing that cannotTbe proved. I may say that no case has been heard of where any litish subject has been called upon to comply with the regulation. 4. The regulation on beards is not new, but is merely the re-enactment °L a . measure which has been allowed to fall into disuse. The renewal of official hostility to shaving is said to be due to Ibn Baud’s annoyance at the oisern ery of a Saudi youth movement and to his determination^ to teach its adherents not to be modernising toads. I learn from a good source that there is at least one fact behind the story of the youth movement viz the the y ai i di i Gove ™ me nt that one of the Hejazi students’in Egypt \as in touch with Salama Musa with a view to the ventilation of Hejazi 456 grievances. It is said that the young man was recalled to Mecca, discovered most conveniently writing an incriminating letter, and put in prison. 5 . The second measure is a prohibition published by the Ministry of Finance forbidding the importation and sale of what were assumed at first to be statuettes, but turn out to be all representations in three dimensions of any living creature, from a bust of Mustafa Kemal to a Teddy bear. It appears that the measure was prompted by the discovery that some of the children in Mecca had dolls to play with, toy rabbits, and the like. It is true that it is unlawful, according to a well-known Moslem authority, for any Moslem to have an image in his house ; but, according to the same authority, Mahomet cursed all painters of men or animals, yet photography is allowed in the Hejaz. Ibn Saud allows himself to be photographed, and this year a cinema film of the pilgrimage was taken and afterwards shown in Egypt, which could hardly have been taken without the King’s consent. But per haps there is some distinction in the Wahabi tenets between figures in the round and in the flat, which enables the latter to be classed as harmless, or perhaps photographs can be attributed to light and therefore to Allah. 6 . There is yet another measure which I hear is to be applied during the forthcoming pilgrim season, though it has not been announced in public. All women pilgrims are to wear complete wrappings such as the Hejaz women ^ wear. Of late years some women pilgrims have been wearing the pre-war Turkish dress (black) of cape, close-fitting hood, and thinnish veil, but this is no longer to be considered adequate. It is not known what action will be taken against recalcitrants, still more against any women who are rash enough to follow the example of those Egyptian ladies who, I am assured, some times appeared unveiled even in the courtyard of the Mecca mosque this last season. 7 . Copies of this despatch are being sent to Cairo, Bagdad and Jerusalem. (43) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter No. P. Z.-5506/37, dated the 20 th August 1937.

All information of importance contained in these reports is in any case reported separately and earlier, by despatch and copies of any such despatches are sent to the departments interested. There would accord- ingly seem to Lord Halifax to be little advantage in continuing the distribu tion of this information a second time in the form of a monthly report which is compiled by His Majesty’s Legation primarily for their own record, in a form which is not always entirely convenient for wider distribution.3. It is, however, not proposed that the local distribution to adjoining posts from Jedda of roneo-ed copies of the reports should be discontinued. 4.

Z. 5795/37, dated the 1st September 1937. Received on 26th September 1937 with Political Secretary's letter No. 36, dated the 9th September 1937. Letter from British Legation, Jedda, to India Office, London, No. 133 (.1137/249/8), dated the 3rd August 1937. As I have already had the honour to report in my telegram No. 69 of August 1st, the Amir Saud, accompanied by his brother the Amir Muhammad, Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, and his suite, returned to Jedda on the 1st August. 2. On the previous evening a printed notice was received by me at a late hour, setting forth the programme of reception ; the ship was due to arrive about 8 a.m. His Royal Highness would be received at the Customs quay, where the diplomatic corps would be looked after by a certain Jamil Davud, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and so forth. I am informed by some of my colleagues that this was the first occasion on which such a printed notice has been circulated ; but I was evidently fortunate in receiving it the previous evening, as most of the “ corps diplomatique ” did not receive it till the morning of the reception. 3. Mr. Gault and I arrived at the Customs building at 8 a. m. and found a large airy shed, elaborately carpeted and provided with chairs. A broad central passage between two blocks of chairs led up to the seat of honour behind which were about thirty other seats. The Chief of Customs greeted us, and Jamil Davud informed me of my serial number in the diplomatic order of precedence. The diplomatic corps were given seats on one side of the central passage, the other side being reserved for great personages such as the Guardian of the Keys of the Kaaba, the Director of Education, the Censor of Morals, and many other persons of note, almost all of whom’ had come to Jedda the previous day. 4. The Amir Feisal arrived soon after 8 a.m. and greeted the diplomatic corps, the introductions being made by Jamil Davud. The Amir sat first in the chair of honour, the chairs behind him being allotted to about thirty members of the Royal family ; I was told that most, but not all, of them were the offspring of King Abdul Aziz. The weather was sultry, and though the customs shed has been well designed to catch any sea breeze which may be blowing, the diplomatic corps, as well as some of the Arabs, seemed glad to repose in their comfortable chairs and wait for the arrival of the Heir Appa rent. Four aeroplanes circled round at intervals. The crowd included many picturesque types of Arab ; merchants with their old-fashioned Hejazi hats, young students, fierce soldiers with rifles and full bandoliers, and grave muj- tahids from the Holy places all rubbed shoulders, making a many-coloured throng. 5. At about 9-15 a.m. the Amir Saud and his companions arrived at the quay and were escorted to the shed. The Amir Feisal and the other royal personages having greeted the two Amirs very affectionately, all the other Arabs thronged around to salute them, with kisses on the''face, or on the hand, or with hand-clasps, according to rank. The Amir Saud behaved with great dignity and charm, and appeared to me to be in excellent health and spirits. 6 . The Diplomatic corps were presented by the Amir Feisal and Jamil Davud. The Amir Saud shook hands with each. He then took his seat on the chair of honour which the Amir Feisal had vacated, and various addresses of felicitation were read or recited to him. The first was an address of wel come, which contained a reference to the accident which had taken place in Scotland ; the speaker’s congratulations on the Prince’s happy escape evoked a burst of applause. The court poet then came forward and recited a lengthy ode with much vigour and with flashing eyes. 1 was disappointed to observe that he did not adhere to ancient tradition and recite his poem from memory • he quite openly had his poem written on a paper in his hand, and referred toit before every line. The perspiration poured off his nose and out of his beard as h.3 worked himself into paroxyms of loyalty, but the drops did not obliterate the writing and he let the audience have 'the full benefit of every word. The heat was not the only thing he had to contend with ; aeroplanes swooping down over the shed with a deafening roar, just missing the roof, drowned his voice ; bursts of clapping in the middle of elegant lines spoiled the effect of the final vowel; but he was deteimined to let us have it all, and repeated, sometimes three times, those parts of the poem which he thought had not been properly heard. After him a little boy, with a squeaky voice, repeated, from memory this time, a long poem of welcome from the school boys of Jedda ; and then an older boy gave us another eloquent address of welcome, ending by a series of what might be called antiphonal responses from his comrades in the assembly. An aged poet from Medina also read a poem, full of eloquence but without so much of the fire which had distinguish ed the previous speakers. 7. The ceremony was now drawing to its close. The Amir Saud address ed a few words to the Diplomatic corps, thanking them for their attendance, and I believe that the dean of the Diplomatic corps, Monsieur Hakimoff, the Soviet Minister, replied shortly in suitable terms. The Amir then rose and shook hands with all the members of the Diplomatic Corps in their order of precedence ; and I was able to offer him congratulations in Arabic. He, in reply, said what an excellent time he had passed in the United Kingdom and asked me again to thank all who had been so kind to him. We were then able to depart, and to take off the collars and ties which are so seldom worn here, and which aggravate the unpleasantness of living in a moist heat which has not gone much below 90 degrees Fahrenheit for several days and nights. 8 . As we drove back through arches decorated with green and white Mr. Gault told me that he had heard from a member of the French Legation that a demonstration against the Palestine Report had been staged for just after the ceremony of greeting. Nothing of the sort happened, however. 9. I was much impressed by the dignified appearance and bearing of the Amir Saud. It also appeared that everyone was very pleased to see him back ; old inhabitants of Jedda say that all these ceremonies are engineered and ordered by the government ; but it really did appear that the people who attended the reception were genuinely glad to see the Heir Apparent return. Much dancing and jollity has been arranged in the streets of Jedda during the past few days ; perhaps Arabs are used to dancing round fires in a moist heat of 90 degrees ; but it seemed to me that everyone was really quite pleas ed. 10. At 3 p.m. that afternoon I was received by Sheikh Yusuf Yasin at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. I found him attired only in a large white towel; he did not explain this costume until the end of our interview when he said he was going to Mecca to perform a ‘ towaf ’ or circumambulation. He was very agreeable, and repeated how pleased the Princes had been at their staj 7 in England. I understand that all the returning party left Jedda for Mecca on the evening of the day they arrived.

Letter from India Office, to Governor, Aden, No. P. Z. 5686/37, dated the 12th August 1937. I have the honour to refer to Colonel Lake’s secret despatch No. 392 of the 19th August 1936, and also to your secret despatch of the 26th May 1937, on the subject of the internal situation in the Yemen, in which 3 r ou ask for instructions as to the attitude to be adopted by local British representa tives if they are approached by contending parties within the State.63 2 . Italian activities in the Middle East generally have been, and are, engaging the very close and earnest attention of His Majesty’s Government, but for the present you may regard the following as the policy which should, in my opinion, be adopted by His Majesty’s Government in the event of internal disturbance in the \emen following on the death of the King. 3. British policy requires that neither the Yemen nor any part of it should fall under the control of any European Power. There is no question of giving encouragement to opponents of the recognised heir ; and in the event of the death of the King, His Majesty’s Government should recognise 8 eif el Islam Ahmed as soon as it appears that he is accepted as Imam, but should remain neutral and retain freedom of action if his misrule leads to civil war. In that case His Majesty’s Government should reach an under standing with the de facto ruler of the Yemeni provinces adjoining the Aden Protectorate and of Hodeidah, and should endeavour to counteract other foreign influences in these districts.

So far as the Ad miralty are concerned, no strategical interests of any importance are in volved in the Gulf of Aqaba, and My Lords see no reason for a Mandated enclave in the area. 2. With regard to the question of establishing a satisfactory anchorage of the section of coast lying between the existing town of Aqaba and the Egyptian frontier, I am to inform you that the head of the Gulf of Aqaba is subject to occasional very strong south-south-westerly winds which raise a heavy sea, and that there is no protected port at Aqaba, which is an open roadstead. 3. There is, however, anchorage water at the north-w r est side of the head of the Gulf, and it would be possible to build a breakwater for protection from southerly winds and to make a port there between Aqaba and the Egyptian Frontier which could form a port of outlet to the Red Sea for the Arab and Jewish States in the event of Aqaba being ceded to Ibn Saud. A copy of Chart No. 3595, showing the anchorage and breakwater proposed, is attached. Copies of this letter, without enclosure, have been sent to the War Office, Air Ministry, Treasury, Colonial Office, India Office, and the Secretary of the Middle East Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence. 69(C) ExAffairsDept.65 (55) Enclosure in Colonial Office covering letter No. P.

Letter from Governor’s Office, Aden, to Secretary of State for Colonies, London, dated the 18th August 1937. \\ ith reference to my secret despatch of May 28th last regarding Italian acti\ ities in the \ emen and connected matter, I have the honour to transmit herewith a copy of a memorandum which has been prepared by Captain B. W. Seager, the Frontier Officer, who returned to Aden from San’a on August 6 th last after a month’s stay in the Yemen. Enclosure to S. No. (55). Memorandum by Captain B. W. Seager, the Frontier Officer, dated the 20th July 1937. During my stay in San’a this month I find that I have not collected very much fresh data to amplify my reports submitted towards the end of 1936. The following represents the results of my observations and the information imparted to me by the various personalities I have met in this town and on my way to and from the Yemen. 2 . General.—The question of the succession to the Imamate still interests all classes. The Crown Prince’s stock is rising and I begin to have very little doubt that he wiil succeed his father in the first instance. Apart from theWazirs, he seems to fear the rivalry of his brother Ali most of all. The latter is still in prison and will remain there if the Crown Prince has his way though he w'ould prefer to see him dead. It is reliably reported that an attempt was actually made to poison him recently. Doctor Petrie was called in to attend him and told me that he had treated him for dysentery in the first instance but that he reacted too early to this treatment which led him to believe that his internal disorders were not due to disease but probably to poison. He is kept shackled and in chains and although permission was sought to get these removed while he was ill, the King would not hear of it. I have met Ali twice in the past. He is a pleasant young man and popular with all. He is said to have a following who would risk a lot to get him out of prison but 1 fancy he will be lucky to emerge alive unless the Crown Prince has his wings clipped. 3. The Crown Prince has mended his ways slightly but his natural indo~ lence coupled with his extreme harshness and cruelty still make him an un popular figure.^ He is greatly feared and this may stand him in good stead after his father s death as the electoral body will probably prefer to nominate him rather than incur his wrath. 4. I believe he thinks he is cutting a fine figure in the public eye and there is no doubt that he tries to stir himself into greater activity ; but in mentality he combines the graces of an impulsive blundering with the vindictiveness and unreasonable cruelty of an oriental despot of the good old days. Decently, for instance, he imprisoned a soldier for desertion and ordered that he was to die of starvation. At the end of his tether this un fortunate wretch managed to shoot himself with a rifle belonging to one of the sentries. In any other country in the world the Crowm Prince would have been torn limb from limb years ago, but here in San’a we live in the year 1200. 5. I was unfortunately unable to see him on my present visit as he was suffering with stomachic pains probably due to over indulgence.6 . The King is fit enough but looks tired : he has aged a lot since I saw him in October last. He is in full possession of his faculties and still attends to the minutest affairs of State. It would be useful to cite an example of this. During my audience on July 17th last we were interrupted by the entrance of the Prime Minister who sought authority to order an official car from the State garage for the King’s 13th son. This authority was granted and he was told to address a note in this sense to the Director of Motor Trans port. The King suspended our audience while he watched Qadhi Abdullah draft the note : when it was completed he was shown the draft which he slightly amended, initialled, and, as is usual in this country, throw on to the floor for action. 7. The Wazir family are still an element to be considered in the matter of the succession but as the Crown Prince increases his influence and makes his position felt in the Zeidi highlands—and there is no doubt that he is doing so—so much must the Wazir star wane. Seyyid Ah ibn El Wazir, the Go vernor of Taiz district has not been in the Zeidi highlands for 14 years and is naturally out of touch with the highlander whose memory is always a short one. Seyyid Abdullah ibn El Wazir, Governor of Hodeidah, in his turn spends most of his time in the Tihama and also lacks contact with the Zeidi element who prefer faces and deeds, however unwelcome, to memories and past exploits. Seyyid Muhammad ibn El Wazir, Governor of Dhamar, is a fine looking Governor but little political importance can be attached to him. I believe the Wazirs fancy that they have much more influence with the Shafei tribes than they actually do in fact. The Governor of Taiz, for instance, once told me that he was perfectly well assured of his Shafeis’ loyalty but I begin to doubt it now. In any event when the present King dies I do not doubt that the Yemeni Shafei tribes on the Taiz border will be restive and give us trouble whether or not the present Governor of Taiz directs their movements into deliberate aggression against our tribesmen. 8 . Italian Activities in the Yemen .—I have no fresh information to re port regarding Italian activities in this country. Doctor E. Dubbiosi, the organising head of Italian activities in this country, returned from leave only three days ago. During his absence, Doctor Ferri, who left the country about a month ago, and Doctor Cicconi, an alleged high jumper of interna tional repute some years ago, who was in private practice at Trinidad two years ago, acted for him. In this interim period they appear to have been content to act merely as paymasters to their agents in this country. It is unfortunate that I must leave San’a shortly as Doctor Dubbiosi has doubtless arrived with fresh instructions and it would have been interesting to observe whether any new form of renewed activities were envisaged. 9. Doctor Cicconi, who speaks English quite well, told Petrie that he anticipates trouble with Dubbiosi as the latter is a reserved taciturn creature strictly opposed to any form of social activity ; and Cicconi is a man about town who likes his innocent little parties and recreations. 10. The Italian colony in the Yemen now numbers eleven souls. They are :— (а) Doctor E. Dubbiosi . (б) Doctor Cicconi . (c) Signor Kiccuci and wife (d) Signor dementi and wife • (e) Signor Chapressi , . (/) Signor Fausto . » ((?) Signor Nevio Gione , • (h) Signor Murucci . . . Chief Italian doctor in the Yemen. Italian Surgeon San’a. . Clerk to Doctor Dubbiosi and undoubtedly his right hand man in political work. On Petrie’s authority I have it that he has nothing to do with the medical work. He lives in one of the most secluded parts in San’a in a house which would be an ideal centre for the visits ot agents. He is a native of Florence where his family own vineyards. In age he is about 50, speaks Arabic and indifferent French : has worked for years in Mogadiscio. . Messrs. Lazzerinis’ agent in San’a. His wife who is a Swiss speaks perfect English and has spent six years in the United Kingdom. . Senior Italian engineer in The Yemeni Govern ment workshops in San’a. . Second Italian engineer in The Yemeni Gov ernment workshops in San’a. . Italian doctor in Taiz : recently replaced Doctor Pultroni. . Italian doctor in Hodeida.11 . During my three weeks’ stay in the Yemen I heard no one hint at or mention the Italian bogey ; and my contacts were comprehensive in the capital and on my way to and fro. I could explain the present atmosphere in this connection more clearly by saying that if an official unaware of the political situation in the Red Sea was to have visited San’a instead of myself and had been charged to report on the general political situation after a three weeks study, he would surely have heard nothing from officials, notables, merchants or tribesmen about the Italians, let alone their intentions unless he had asked them pointed questions. This has surprised me considerably and I have to confess that it is difficult to account for it. I could venture a theory that as the “ Italian menace ” to this country has not materialised following a two year period when such a contingency was the topic of the day, the Yemenis, with typical oriental casualness and inherent natural desire to let unpleasant things slide when these do not rear up and goggle at them, have subconsciously relegated the “ menace ” to the background. If something tangible under this head does take shape it will be the front page again, but why, in their way of thinking, should good time be wasted by kicking against the pricks when these pricks do not appear to prick. As I constantly emphasise the unexpected nature of things in this peculiar country I do not dare to push my theory any further. In any event it fits in with the present atmosphere : and I venture to say as much as this with reserve. As it will be seen further on I have not yet had the opportunity of speaking to the Governor of Taiz who might raise the question of the Italians and their activities in this country. If he does so I will report separately in due course. 12. Though it is irrelevant here it is worthy of record to state that the Yemeni intelligentsia appear to be very interested in the Spanish war which they follow closely. They all fear that circumstances may arise there which will start a general war. 13. Personalities. —(a) Seif El Islam Hussein .—I have heard no talk in this country of this son’s chances for the Imamate although he cannot be ruled out as a candidate. The King considers him to be his most learned and pious son and I understand that this pillar of purity does all he can to foster his father’s belief. The Crown Prince does not seem to have his knife into him, at present anyhow, and this in itself indicates that he considers him no rival: an intrigue to get him into trouble on his return from London or an attempt to poison him would be a healthy sign and show that his stock was rising. Hussein would be acceptable to the Wazirs and this should be borne in mind. He saw quite a lot of them on his way to Europe via Hodeida and Taiz. and, as he cannot help intriguing, it would not be a far-fetched guess to assume that the future was discussed in detail. In the course of a conversation I had with Raghib a few days ago I sought to sound him about Hussein’s stay in London. He was vague and said that the King himself had only heard three times from him by telegraph. He assured me categorically that no instructions had been given him or tele graphed to him regarding the making of representations in London in any matter or matters other than that of the Palestinians. This is interesting. It is true that the King has his own peculiar little ways of usurping his Foreign Minister’s functions without consulting him but I should be much surprised if he had instructed his son to make any representations in a foreign capital without Raghib’s knowledge. I must aver that on receipt of a recent Foreign Office despatch concerning Hussein’s talks at the Foreign Office I was sur prised to note that he had touched on the question of British representation in the Yemen. I assumed at once that he had acted on his own initiative, and, if Raghib is to be believed, my assumption was correct. In the matter of the selection of the Yemeni Coronation Mission, Raghib told me that in the first instance he had been commanded to head the Corona- nation Mission and he had accepted with alacrity. Later the King decided that a son of his should head the Mission and that Raghib should proceed as second delegate. When Raghib heard that the son was to be Seif El Islam Hussein he managed, with the greatest difficulty, to back out on the grounds of ill health. Such a deadlock was reached apparently that the King told Raghib that if he did not proceed he would send no Mission; but as the Aden68 Government had already been informed in writing that a Mission would pro ceed, Hussein was eventually instructed to leave without the Foreign Minis- tor. Ihe lattei told me that he had suffered at Hussein’s hands in the past in the matter of his arrogance and autocratic behaviour. X could not help remaiking that I had only met this princeling in 1937 and that I could agree that he was arrogant and autocratic. At my audience with the King on July 17th last he asked me after his boy Hussein ”. I replied that when I last saw him he appeared to be in rude health. It appears that he has informed his father that he is suffering from anaemia and that he is consulting specialists in London. (b) Qadhi Abdullah El Amri. —The Prime Minister is as powerful as evei and is still the King s most trusted adviser. He is much disturbed about the succession and constantly prays for the King’s long life. In this he is sincere as his own future is very uncertain after King Yahya’s death. . In his reference to the Crown Prince he is careful not to criticise him but prays that Allah may guide him and equip him for rulership which implies that at present he is n o fit person to rule ; this is the general view and I share it. The Prime Minister is quite certain in his own mind that the Crown l Prince will succeed in the first instance and makes no secret about it. Qadhi Abdullah s relations with Raghib have worsened—if that were possible and though outwardly they are the best of friends their one desire is to oust the other. Qadhi Abdullah is more charitable than Raghib and merely refers to him as a tiresome old man. (c) Qadhi Muhammad Raghib Bey. —During my stay here this month I have noticed that Raghib, like the King, has aged considerably since October 1936. He finds it more difficult to grasp matters of detail and sometimes has to repeat words to himself before they sink in. He is, I think, over 70 years of age and his thirteen years in this capital without change have worn him clow n. At the moment he and the Prime Minister are engaged in under ground warfare to silch an extent that Raghib is obsessed with it. The vast amount of intrigue in this town and the sinister interpretations attributed to the most innocent acts sometimes lead me to wonder whether I have stumbled on a \ ast^ mental institution. It surpasses the bounds of all normal human understanding. As part of my time here is spent listening patiently to stories about the sinister machinations of this person and that? I have to hear a donkey bray or a dog bark before I am brought back to a sense of reality. Raghib suffers from this form of hysteria to a marked extent. I am quite convinced that he w^ould do anything and sacrifice every- thmg to get out of this country at the earliest opportunity. His relations with all lemenis are most unhappy but the King will not let him go even if he spurns him and treats him abominably at times. In spite of this, how ever, I belie\ e that he is secretly flattered by the King’s refusal to release him and I do not doubt that this alone makes life endurable to him. (d) Seyyid Abdullah ibn El Wazir.—Thz Governor of Hodeida still seems to carry his anti-Christian bias to an extreme. He has recently much embarrassed our political clerk in Hodeida and told him quite openly that he would be as difficult and as uncompromising as he could with any person * who served th e Christians. Mn Salih Jafar deserves commendation for his tact and self-possession as his patience has been sorely tried. Seyyid Abdullah for all his outward show of dignity and grandeur is a chicken-hearted poseur. I am quite sure that, like his cousin in Taiz, he is piqued at the Aden Govern ment s apparent disregard of the importance of the Wazirs while he knows that we want no quarrel with the Yemeni Government and its officials. In the circumstances he feels that he is safe enough to vent his spleen on and deri\ e malicious pleasure in baiting Mr. Salih Jafar wdio is wise enough to remain unruffled. ^ It is clear that he is acting deliberately and for a set pur pose and his anti-Christian pose serves the object in view. Like his cousin in Taiz, but in a different manner, I think he strives to make it emerge that W azirs can be a nuisance if they are not placated. Seyyid Abdullah met his cousin, the Governor of Taiz, in April last Jhese two had not met for fifteen years or more and it is not difficult to guess that they discussed future Wazm policy in all its aspects. Before this meet ing it was reported that their relations had not been of the most cordial and 1 suppose that this has now been remedied. 69(C) ExAffainiDepft69 I am inclined to recommend that however mischievous the Waziris can be it would be politic to continue to keep them at a distance particularly as there is now little doubt that the Crown Prince will succeed his father. His reign may be a short one and a disastrous one but he may find time to twist the tails of the Wazirs before he lays down the reins of office or is bumped off the throne. If he cannot do so and if the Wazirs prove too strong for him there will be time enough to reconsider our policy in regard to them. I have not yet been able to determine what attaches the Wazirs have with the Italians but I believe that they would come on bended knee to the Aden Government before they approached the Italians seriously. However this country is a peculiar one and it is dangerous to anticipate events. I have heard little or nothing on my present visit regarding Seyyid Abdullah’s bid for the Imamate. His relations with the Crown Prince are as bad as ever and I do not think that there is any chance of improvement. The Crown Prince is well aware of the Wazir’s aspirations and his watch on them is relentless as it is menacing. (e) Seyyid Ali ihn el Wazir. —The Governor of Taiz requested me to return via Taiz on my way back to Aden as he wanted to speak to me con fidentially. This I promised to do. (As the overland route was flooded I could not return via Taiz.) 14. The Army. —It is reliably reported that the King is endeavouring to introduce a system of conscription in this country. His idea is to institute a period of four months with the colours and that on the expiry of this period the trained reservists will be released but not before fresh batches arrive in San’a to replace them. So far the experiment has not proved successful as only about 1,600 tribesmen have been enrolled. I understand the tribes are suspicious and fear that once their tribesmen have been enrolled they will not be released. The powerful Hashid tribe has so far stood out against any form of conscription and the King is negotiat ing with them now. 15. For the training of the conscripts the King has engaged the services of Hassan Tahsin Pasha who claims to have been G. O. C. of the Hejazi troops in Jedda during the Saudi-Hejazi war. The Pasha called on me during my present visit. He claims to have been a divisional commander in the Turkish Army during the war and says he is 58 years of age. He is either older than he claims to be or was not a divisional commander during the Great War. In any event he is full of enthusiasm about his task and states that he has excellent material in the Zeidi tribesmen for whom the conscription system has been introduced. I did not like to damp his ardour but I fear he has a heart breaking task. (56) Enclosure in Colonial Office letter No. P. Z. 6555/37, dated the 4th October 1937. Received on 23rd October 1937 with Political Secretary's letter No. 40, dated the 7th October 1937. Letter from Governor, Aden, to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for the Colonies, Downing Street, S. W. 1, dated the 7th September 1937. I have the honour to transmit herewith, for your information, a record of Mr. Salih Jafar, British Political Clerk Hodeida’s conversations with certain Yemeni officials on his return journey to Hodeida from Aden via Taiz, Haiss and Zabid on August 6th to 9th.70 Enclosure to S. No. (56). Record of Mr. Salih Jafar’s conversations with certain Yemeni OFFICIALS ON HIS RETURN JOURNEY TO HODElDA FROM ADEN (AUGUST 6th—9th). On his return journey to Hodeida Mr. Salih Jafar visited Seyyid Ali ibn El Wazir, Governor-General of the Taiz district. Seyyid Ali told Mr. Salih Jafar that an Italian Mission, headed by the Governor of Asmara, was expected to proceed to the Yemen in September in order to open pourparlers for the renewal of the Italo-Yemeni treaty. Syyid Ali remarked that the Mission was expected to ask for concessions in the Yemen. 2. At Haiss in the Yemeni Tihama Mr. Salih Jafar had talks with Sheikh Ali Muhammad Noman (a non-Zeidi) the Amil (Governor) of Haiss. Sheikh Ali told Mr. Salih Jafar that Seyyid Ali ibn El Wazir (the Governor General of the Taiz district) was a bitter enemy of the Noman family. He added that a complaint had been lodged by the family of the late Ali Pasha of Udain against Seyyid Ali for the misappropriation of about two-thirds of their property valued at about 100,000 dollars ; and that a letter from Seyyid Ali to his San’a agent had been intercepted and was now in the hands of Sheikh Abdul Wahab Noman (the uncle of the Haiss Amil) in which the true facts of the Ali Pasha case were revealed. The intercepted letter also contained statements derogatory to the Yemeni Government. Sheikh Ali said that this letter was to be handed to Seif El Islam Ahmed, the Crown Prince, in San’a. Mr. Salih Jafar was further informed that Seif El Islam Ahmed had recently required the personal attendance in San’a of Seyyid Ali to answer the charges brought against him by the Ali Pasha family but that the King had not allowed the issue of the summons. This had much upset the Crown Prince. According to Sheikh Ali Muhammad Noman, the Governor General of Taiz is disliked by the Shafei tribesmen in the Taiz district. 3. Mr. Salih Jafar arrived at Zabid in the Yemeni Tihama on the even ing of August 8th and stayed the night as the guest of Sheikh Ali ibn Hamud of Kaukaban the Amil (Governor) of Zabid who is one of the many claimants to the Imamate. He informed Mr. Salih Jafar that when he had left San’a he had been given a document (apparently that reported in paragraph 6479 of the Aden Political Intelligence Summary) and was asked not only to sign it but also to obtain the signatures of the leading personalities in the Zeidi highlands and in the Tihama in which the signatories signified their willing ness to the proclamation of Seif El Islam Ahmed as Crown Prince and as King after the death of King Yahya. Seyyid Ali said that he had succeeded in collecting the signatures of all the parties concerned (? including that of the Wazirs). 4. Seyyid Ali remarked that if after the death of King Yahya, Seif El Islam Ahmed failed as a ruler and the Yemen decided to have a King (and thus abolished the Imamate) Seyyid Ali ibn El Wazir (Governor General of the Taiz district) would, in his opinion, have the majority of the people be hind him ; but that in the event of the continuance of the Imamate, Seyyid Abdullah ibn El Wazir (cousin of Seyyid Ali ibn El Wazir) the Governor of Hodeida or another personality (meaning himself) might well be elected. 5. Seyyid Ali concluded his conversation by saying that he hoped that the British Government would stop foreign interference in the Yemen and help to maintain its independence. (57) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter No. P. Z. 6822/37, dated the 16th October 1937. Enclosure in Air Mail letter No. 42, dated the 20th October 1937, from Secre tary, Political and Secret Department, India Office. Letter from British Legation, Jedda, to India Office, London, No. 149 (1353/384/340), dated the 13th September 1937. In continuation of my telegram No. 77 of September 13th I have the honour to forward to you herewith a copy of the original Arabic text and a71 translation of the note-verbale which His Royal Highness the Amir Faisal sent to me on September 12th under cover of a personal note asking me to communicate it to you as soon as possible. 2 . I have done my best with the rather obscurely-worded text. The two parts of the translation about which I have the greatest doubt are the part dealing with the delay in Sheikh Kamil el Qassab’s arrival and depar ture, and the last sentence. The former is not of great importance. As for the latter, I suspect that there is a misprint and what the King really meant was that the promoters of the conference contented themselves with' making as few arrangements as possible, in deference to His Majesty’s disapproval of the whole idea of the conference. 3. The general meaning is I think clear. Ibn Sand is anxious to show His Majesty’s Government that he continues to do nothing contrary to their policy, and that in pursuance of that aim he is not afraid to stand up to Iraqi and Syrian extremists. 4. I am sending copies of this despatch with enclosures to His Majesty’s Representatives at Cairo (No. 1354/384/340), Bagdad, (No. 1356/384/340) and the Officer Administering the Government of Palestine at Jerusalem (No. 1355/384/340). Enclosure to S. No. (57). Enclosure to Jedda despatch No. 149 (1353/384/340) of I3th September 1937. Note Verbale. H. M. the King has read Mr. Eden’s reply to the royal message which I communicated to you on the 19th Jumad-ath-Thani 1356 (August 26th 1937), and I have to say that H. M. the King wishes to make it clear to the British Government that Sheikh Kamil el Qassab left here convinced that there would be no need to convene a general Arab conference as he had pre viously intended : but owing to a delay which resulted in his not arriving in Syria at the time which he had originally fixed for his return, persons who were desirous of holding the conference had without delay issued invitations for the 8th day of September : and that persons from Iraq who shared their interest in the conference had already agreed to convene the conference. The conveners of the conference have therefore apologised to us saying that though they approved of our idea, and wished to comply with our desire, the arrangements which were made had already progressed so far that it would have been impolitic to change them entirely. They were therefore content to make as few arrangements as possible. (58) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter No. P. Z. 6601/37, dated the 6th October 1937. Received on 30th October 1937 with Political Secretary's letter No. 41, dated the 14th October 1937. (Notes by G. W. Rendel, dated the 29th September 1937.) Signor Crolla, the Counsellor of the Italian Embassy, raised this question With me again on September 27th. He said that he had at first thought of sending in a formal note on the subject, but that the Italian Government did not wish a formal written communication to be made at this stage in advance of the proposed Rome Conversations. He had, however, been authorised to explain their views in a preliminary and informal way, and he suggested that perhaps the best plan would be for him to do this orally and for us to have an agreed record of the conversation. 2 . I replied that this seemed to me open to any objections. An agreed record would be an even more formal and committing document than a written note and would need very carefully working out. I added that while I should be very glad to hear anything he had to say I doubted whether there was really much advanatge in discussing the matter further until we knewI IT 72 father more about what was likely to happen over the proposed general con versations in Rome. If these conversations took place, it might be conve nient, just before they started, to have a talk about the present question ; but if they were for any reason delayed, I doubted whether much would be gained by a preliminary discussion at this end of this particular question in isolation. 3. Signor Crolla then said that he thought perhaps the best thing to do would be to show me the draft of an informal communication which he had prepared, stating the Italian point of view. This was a kind of aide memoire, in Italian only, which he said he could not leave with me but which he would like me to read. 4. I went through this document with him. Its main thesis was that the Rome Understanding of 1927 applied not only to the Red Sea area but to Southern Arabia as a whole. It represented that it was an essential prin ciple of the Rome Understanding that the status quo existing at the time of its signature should not be modified except by agreement and in consulta tion with the Italian Government. The Italian Government at that time had known nothing of our claims over what we now called the northern and eastern areas of the Aden Protectorate, i.e. the Hadramaut, Shehr, Mokalla, etc., and they could only regard our new “ forward ” policy in this area— which in their view had the effect of adding some 40,000 square miles to the Aden Protectorate—as an annexation of territory in violation of the Rome Understanding. This contention was supported in the draft by a number of extremely flimsy arguments, several of which I was able to controvert immediately, though Signor Crolla naturally professed not to be convinced. The draft aide memoire was accompanied by a draft annex giving specific instances of our alleged forward policy. 5. I told Signor Crolla that it was obvious from the text of the Rome Understanding itself that that Understanding was not intended to refer to any of the areas in Arabia which were under our protection. Had it been intended to deal with this part of Arabia those areas would, of course, have been mentioned. But there was no mention even of the Aden Protectorate in the agreement, although the existence of the Protectorate and our interest in it was of course well known and generally accepted at the time. I presum ed that the Italian Government were not trying to challenge our position at Aden, although the argument developed in Signor Crolla’s draft could be read as an attempt to do so. 6. Signor Crolla admitted that the Rome Understanding could not be regarded as in any way interfering with our rights in the Aden Protectorate, but he repeated that the Protectorate, as then understood by the Italian Government, was a much smaller area than what we now claimed, and again urged, in support of this contention, that it had always been so shown on ail published maps etc. Seeing an atlas on my table, he suggested that we should look it up in proof of his contention. The atlas was Stieler’s Hand- atlas, 1921 edition, and contained an excellent map of Arabia, on which, to Signor Crolla’s discomfiture, practically the whole of the southern coast of Arabia turned out to be marked red, as a British possession. (This was a piece of luck, for I fear that Signor Crolla is on stronger ground on this parti cular point even than he thinks, since there are many old official publica tions—including, I believe, India Office and Colonial Office lists—describing the Protectorate as a very much smaller area than what we now claim.) Signor Crolla again emphasised that what the Italians complained of was not our established rights in the Aden Protectorate but what he described as our attempt to extend the boundaries of the Protectorate for something like 500 miles to the east and for a great distance into the hinterland. I explained to Signor Crolla that there had been no. change whatever in the political situation. Our sphere, as I had explained to him before, was bounded by the Anglo-Turkish boundaries of 1914. There had never been the slightest question of our extending our influence beyond that sphere, which had been our sphere since long before the War. But within it we had always claimed special rights. Our position in the south eastern corner of the Aden Protectorate rested on a number of ancient treaties with the local chiefs. Identical treaties existed with the chiefs in the area now being brought under closer administrative control. Whatever arbitrary distinc tion unofficial maps might have shown between the south western and the wmmsmmmmamnmmm73 north eastern areas of the Protectorate, the fact remained that legally there had been no difference between these areas. The fact that we had always regarded the whole area as falling within our sphere was obvious from the fact that it was we who had negotiated the boundary with the Turks. There would have been no point in our negotiating with the Turks about this unless we had had some claim over the territory on our side of the line. 8 . As regards the Rome Understanding of 1927, I was convinced that its negotiators had never intended to deal with anything but the Red Sea area. This seemed to me clear from the text, where the words “ Southern Arabia ” were obviously only loosely used to cover the hinterland of Asir. The Rome Understanding did not in any way imply that we claimed no rights in Arabia. We had always claimed to exercise a form of protectorate over a number of Arabian states, especially on the Trucial coast and at Bahrein and Koweit. Our rights over the Hadramaut, as part of the Aden Protec torate, were of precisely the same character. 9. Finally, Signor Crolla said that he had been instructed to suggest that 6 ‘ owing to the difference of opinion between the British and Italian Gov ernments ” as to the interpretation of the Rome Understanding on this point, H. M. G. should suspend all the various measures now being taken, such as the despatch of a Resident to Mokalla, and the raising of local levies in the Hadramaut, pending the clarification of the issue. 10 . I replied to this that I would note what he had said but that I did not see how we could possibly accede to this request, since we regarded the measures in question as a purely internal matter affecting the administration of territory under British protection, and not affected by the Rome Under standing in any way. The territorial status quo in Arabia was not affected. 11 . Eventually, it was agreed that Signor Crolla should write me a private letter embodying, with some slight modifications, the text of the draft aide memoire he had shown me. He showed some reluctance to do this, but I thought it best to ask him to put what he had said in writing as we may as well know the worst, and it may be useful to have the Italian arguments in their own words, in order that w r e may begin considering the best way of answering them. 12. I think we can only await Signor Crolla’s letter, but it looks as though the Italians w r ere working up a somewhat tiresome case about this, and as though we might have a good deal of trouble with them before we have done. (59) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter dated the 7th October 1937. Received on 30th October 1937 with Political Secretary's letter No. 41, dated, the 14th October 1937. Notes by G. W. Rendel, dated the 27th September 1937. Copy No. E. 5648/306/91. Signor Crolla, the Counsellor of the Italian Embassy, told me this after noon that he had been instructed to ascertain whether we were yet in a posi tion to reply to the representations he had made to Mr. Baggallay in August about the title of the British Civil Administrator in Kamaran. He repeated that the Italian Government had been disturbed to see that the “ regente ” of the quarantine station was now described as Civil Administrator. This seemed to imply a degree of authority—and indeed a claim to sovereignty— incompatible with the provision laid down in the Rome Understanding that “no European Power should establish itself on Kamaran”, and the Italian Government hoped that we would take steps to have this title al tered. 2. I told Signor Crolla that I thought the Italian Government were under a misapprehension. While we had been extremely scrupulous in loyally observing our undertaking not to claim any kind of sovereignty in Kamaran, we had, as he knew, always carried on the necessary minimum of administra tion in the island. Since we were responsible for the quarantine station74 as the great majority of pilgrims were British subjects, it was obviously necessary to make sure that the rest of the island was reasonably well manag ed, and this involved a certain degree of administration, policeing, etc. But we exercised these functions in precisely the same provisional way as we managed the quarantine station, and there was absolutely no question of their involving any sort of claim to sovereignty. Indeed, I had good reason to know that we had carefully refrained on many occasions from taking action— e.g. embarking on any development of the island—which might have looked as though we were trying to peg out a claim or dig ourselves in. 3. As regards the title of Civil Administrator, this title had been used ever since we had been in the island, and certainly long before the time of the Rome Conversations. I confirmed, through Mr. Grey of the Library, that as long ago as May, 1926, the British official responsible for the administra tion of the island was officially known as the Civil Administrator. 4. The point I emphasised to Signor Crolla was that there had been no change at all since the time of the Rome Conversations, and that nothing whatever had been done to alter the status of the island. ^ 5. Signor Crolla seemed slightly shaken by this explanation, which he promised to report to his Government.

With reference to my Secret despatch of the 26th May 1937, on the subject of the extension of Italian influence on the Red Sea Littoral and in Aden Pro tectorate territory, I have the honour to inform you that about three weeks ago persistent rumours were in circulation that an Italian warship had sent ashore agents in the Subeihi country, to the west of Aden, and that these agents had distributed arms and money to certain inhabitants of that district. It was not possible to obtain any definite or circumstantial reports regarding these inci dents, but in view of the persistence of the rumours, it seemed desirable that investigations should be conducted as to their accuracy. 2. On the 18th of June therefore I sent the Second Political Officer, Captain the Honourable R. A. B. Hamilton, to the Subeihi country, and between that date ^ and June the 25th, he visited five different centres in the area concerned while a dhow acting under his orders visited Perim and Sheikh Sa’id. 3. As a result of his investigation, Captain Hamilton has come to the con clusion that within the last two months the Italians have turned their attention to the deep anchorage that lies to the west of Ras al Ara on the coast between Aden and Perim. He further thinks that they have established some sort of communi cation with the shore ; there were repeated references by the local Arabs to “ a white-painted steamer ” which had approached the land, and to a vessel described as a submarine that had been seen on several occasions near the shore. 4. It seems possible that the Italians may have explored, in submarines, the Ras-al-Ara anchorage ; and it is averred that during the last two months Italian submarines have frequently been seen between Ras-al-Ara and Bir Saqeiya. Finally, it is reported that Italian agents have visited Saqeiya and another village in the vicinity and have lectured the people on the weakness of Britain and the strength of Italy. 5. You will, no doubt, appreciate the extreme difficulty of establishing the truth or falsehood of such reports ; for naturally, as soon as it is known that investigations to that end are being made, it is hard to find anyone who will admit to any knowledge which might connect him with the subversive activities of a foreign power. But, while I am satisfied that no “ gun-running ”, or distri bution of money on a large scale has recently taken place within the Protecto rate, I am nevertheless forced to the conclusion that Italian agents have, of late, been active in the Subeihi country. 6 . This attempt to introduce Italian influence into the Arabian mainland adjacent to Sheikh Said would be in keeping with the suspected Italian design of securing control of both coasts of the southern Red Sea, and of thereby ^ gaining command of the Straits of Bab-el-Mandab, in the furtherance of which project Italy is believed recently to have fortified Dumeira and Rsheita on the African shore opposite Perim. 7. At this stage I desire merely to acquaint you with the situation as it has presented itself to me, and to state that I am considering what steps should be taken locally to counteract these activities. At present, I am examining the possibility of adopting two complementary measures ; the establishment in the Subeihi country of posts from which reliable information could be collected and rcp0I ii fi ( ii I HVm tlie °l His tlle Sultan of Lahej to take a more active interest in a thorough surveillance of the Subeihi country. 8 . I propose shortly to submit to you a further report with my recom mendations for dealing with the situation. Enclosure 1 to Serial No. (65). Demi-official letter from B. R. Reilly, Esq., Governor, Aden, to H. R. Cowell, Esq., C.M.G., Colonial Office, London, No. C.-768, dated the 30th June 1937. I enclose, for your information, copies of a letter addressed to me by H. E. the Naval Commander-in-Chief, East indies Station, and of my reply. LS109EAD121 Enclosure 2 to Serial No. (65). Letter from British Naval Commander-in-Chief, East Indies Station, g'[o H. M- Naval Office, Colombo, to Governor, Aden, No. E.I.-3464, dated the 5th June 1937. I have the honour to refer to the recent messages exchanged between Your Excellency and myself on the subject of a possible visit to Fasht Island by H. M. S. “ Norfolk ” or H. M. S. “ Weston ” to investigate a reported landing of Italians. I wish to take this opportunity of assuring Your Excellency that neither my message to yourself (times 2302 of 26th May) nor to H. M. S. “ Norfolk ” were intended in any way to deprive you of the use of that ship should you have personally considered it desirable. I was under the impression, however, that this suggestion emanated from the Commanding Officer of H. M. S. “ Norfolk ”, as I was not of the same opinion as the latter, firstly as to the safety of a ship of that size in badly chartered waters, and secondly with regard to the effect on other countries, of the visit of an 8-inch Gun Cruiser to waters which would naturally be thought out of the ordinary and be apt to arouse curiosity and cause comment. On the other hand, the visit of a Sloop to such waters would be a- normal occurrence and likely to pass unnoticed. The landing of Italians on various Islands in the Red Sea has been con stantly reported, and with one exception only these reports have proved entirely false. I do understand, however, that some Italians have been prospecting for oil in the Sarafan and other Islands, and I have even heard it rumoured that they have asked permission to prospect in Kamaran Island and its vicinity. I am not, however, so seriously concerned about the above information, as I am of the fact that Italians have engaged a large number of Yemeni subjects during the last year for service in Eritrea as labourers, or possibly even, accord ing to some reports, as soldiers. Apparently the Italians send these labourers back to Hodeida periodically,, with ample sums of money, and engage others in their place. It is surely unreasonable to engage labourers for such short periods, if effiicient labour is what the Italians require ; on the other hand, if their inten tion is to influence the natives of the Yemen for other purposes, this is precisely the action needed. In any case the Italians appear to find plenty of money to pay them. The Political aspect of this matter is hardly within my province, but should my premise be correct, and the process of educational propaganda continue. I feel that under certain conditions an Italian Yemen would be easy to bring about. I have no doubt that in that case the balance might be rectified by the oppo sition of Saudi Arabia. Your excellent Political Officers, with judicious agents, could doubtless ascertain the nature of the teachings given in Eritrea to these Yemeni labourers, with their reactions thereto, and I feel sure that such information would be of considerable value. These are matters which it is quite impossible for a Sloop, or its officers, to deal with and which I consider to be of prior importance to the possible occupa tion by the Italians of an Island from which they might be evicted. The Red Sea Sloops have orders to keep in close touch with you, and T hope you will not hesitate to make such use of them as you may consider desirable with a view to elucidating the state of affairs. They are free to make out their own cruise programmes which are subject only to the concurrence of the Admi ralty and myself, and in peace time I see no reason why they should not be used as you may require. I attach for your information a copy of a Naval Appreciation of the Red Sea situation which I recently forwarded to the Admiralty. In view of its most secret nature perhaps Your Excellency may consider it desirable to destroy it after perusal.122 I much regret that I have so far not had the opportunity of meeting Your Excellency as you were home on leave during all the time I was at Aden. I am looking forward however to hearing your views on the matters discussed in this letter. P. S .—The latest Naval Intelligence, just received, indicates that during the period 1st September 1936 to 6th May 1937, approximately 3,525 Yemeni subjects went to Eritrea on enlistment by the Italians as labourers, and that of these approximately 1,168 returned to the Yemen bringing back with them a total sum estimated at about 1,690,962 lire. Enclosure 3 to Serial No. (65). Letter from Governor, Aden, to His Excellency the Naval Commander-in- Ohief, East Indies Station, Colombo, No. C.-689, dated the ]9th June 1937. • I have the honour to refer to Your Excellency’s secret and personal letter No. E.I.-3464 [Enclosure 2 to Serial No. (65)], dated 5th June 1937, and to thank you for the assistance that you offer in the use of Red Sea Sloops in dealing with the developments of the situation in southern Red Sea and in the neighbourhood of Aden. There is no doubt that the Italians are endeavouring to forward their interests in the Yemen by every means available short of direct and open inter vention. Their propaganda work in the Yemen, and especially in the coastal Tihama, is increasingly active, and the frequent rumours of their occupation of islands in the Red Sea are a sign of the general apprehension that prevails. The engagement of Yemenis as labourers and sometimes as soldiers, to which you refer, is one of the methods that they adopt to increase their influence. Unfortunately it is not within our power to stop it. The recruitment of Arabs from southern Arabia for Italian Colonial Force is a practice of long standing which commenced before the Great War and has continued at intervals since that time. It has been increased since the autumn of 1935 owing firstly to the Abyssinian war and more recently to the need for labour for carrying out the extensive works, of development that Italy is undertaking at Massawa, Assab and other places in her East African possessions. The Italians offer good wages which appeal to the inhabitants of poor countries such as the Yemen and also the Aden Protectorate. Arabs coming back from Italian employment frequently bring stories of ill-treatment, but they are generally prepared to undergo this for the sake of their financial gain. Incidentally a good deal of the money that they bring with them is smuggled, as the Italian authorities have forbidden the export of lire. 2. I do not think that the short periods for vdiich the labourers work are altogether the result of Italian design. It is customary for such labourers to Avork for a comparatively short time and to return to their families with the money earned, and in this respect the Italians allow them to follow their incli nations. The Yemen is an independent State, and it is not possible for us to prevent this labour recruitment, nor would it in any way add to British popu larity in southern Arabia if we were to debar its people from taking advantage of an opportunity of making money. It is this desire to make money that is the dominating motive with these people and although the Italians no doubt wish to extend their influence through them, the reports that they bring are by no means always favourable. 3- We have recenly had reports of t he appearance of vessels, suspected of being Italian, off the coast immediately to the east of Perim and within the limits of the Aden Protectorate. It is thought that these ships may have been sending munitions into the southern Yemen by this route. I have sent a Political Officer to Hie district to make further enquiries and H. M. S. “ Londonderry ” intends to watch this coast when she is in the neighbourhood. 4. I realise that some of the stories that reach us may be exaggerated or untrue, but I nevertheless feel that there is increasing evidence of Italian designs to obtaining control of both coasts of the southern Red Sea and to establish themselves in the Yemen. I have recently sent a despatch, dated 26th May 1937, to the Colonial Office regarding the internal situation in the Yemen, and I attach a copy of it for Your Excellency’s information.123 5. I thank you for the copy that you have sent of the Naval appreciation of the Reel Sea situation which I have read with great interest, and which I am destroying after perusal. 6. I regret that I was absent from Aden when Your Excellency was here ^ut I hope that there may be another opportunity of meeting you. ( 66 ) Demi-official letter from Major W. R. Hay, to H. A. F. Rumbold, Esq., Txdia Office, London, No. D.-4441-N.|37, dated the 10th November 1937. I am desired to inform you that information has been received that during recent discussions between Maulvi Hussain Ahmed Madni and M. Kifait Ullah of Delhi, the former asked Kifait Ullah to send a message to King Ibn-i-Saud asking him to demand from Britain the immediate return of Aqaba. Agitation in India in support of the demand is to be started as soon as the demand is made. It is understood that Maulvi Ozer Gul of Roorkee Cantonment will carry the message to Mecca where he will be helped by Maulvi Ahmed Hassan who is now in Mecca. Maulvi Ahmed Hassan is Hussain Ahmed Madni’s brother. His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires, Jedda, has been informed.

Speaking of Palestine today Ibn Sand spoke with anxiety of his own situation. He had always considered the maintenance of position of His Majesty s Government as essential to his own and Zionism had brought them into great peril. He spoke of Italy with his usual fear and distrust.

But he evidently cannot believe His Majesty’s Government will carry partition through. He referred seriously to rumours that they were already considering alternative schemes including one where His Majesty’s Govermnent would stop [grp. undec.] and hand Palestine over to Iraq who would then throw Palestine open to unrestricted immigration by the Jews. I described this as fantastic and said that partition scheme remained the policy of His Majesty’s Government though no one could say that recommendations of the Commission to be appointed in this connexion would be. 3. Ibn Saud evidently has a minor anxiety lest His Majesty’s Government should adopt some alternative scheme without consulting him. In fact he said that he trusted His Majesty’s Government would always' communicate to him as early as possible any important information about their Palestine policy. I reminded him that they had always repaid his frankness and said I was confident they would continue to do so.

The death of Sir Gilbert Clayton in 1929 was a great loss to England. The breaking of the “Treaty of Friendship” of 1929, between England and the new King of Mecca has created a very grave issue in the East, and Ibn Saud considers it will lead to a Holy War, which, should it develop, will have a great reaction on the British Colonial Empire.

On the 12th October, last, the heads of the Arab community, met under the presidency of, El Amir Suleiman Karamalli, in the Mosque of the late, Munhiem Ahmet Pascha Karamalli. At this meeting there were also pre sent all the Muftis of Tripolitania, who sent a petition to the Governor General of Libya, with the request that it be forwarded to the Duce. The contents of this petition were as follows: — “We Mussulmans of Tripolitania, and the whole of Libya, are ready to join our brothers in Palestine, for better or for worst, and placing our trust in God, we hope they may obtain their full rights, and wishes. ° We feel that our brothers in Palestine, are suffering owing to the pro posed partitioning of the land of our forefathers. We Mussalmans of Libya submit to you, Duce, a strong protest against England, who has stood in the way of the Arabs, sucked our blood, and taken our money. Is all this not enough? No! she has also taken the Holyland, dividing it into portions amongst our enemies the Jews; consequently we are very hurt. During the Great War it was agreed that we were to be given help and freedom, but now it is the contrary, so much so, that now England has turn ed against us. Beloved Duce, we want your help, such as you have promised us in your speeches many times. Now you know our opposition to ignorant England we leave everything in your hands, so that Italy may give us a helping hand and we are always ready to take your orders as before. England versus the rights of the Mussulmans. The British Government returned to Palestine, and sent out all the Mussalmans! England wishes to act against the word of God! If the Mussalmans leave Palestine, the British Government should hand over England, because centuries ago it was part of the Roman Empire, and also8 Spain to the Mussalmans. It was the Arabs and not the Jews who helped England to take Neapolis. Who was it who destroyed the Railway lines during the Great War? it was not the Jews, but the Arabs! We sent away the Turks from Palestine, with the intention that we should be allowed to stay there. We have helped England also in the taking of Aleppo, and we Mussulmans are upset because England has given the best part of the country to the Jews, leaving the other to the Arabs.

I have the honour to report the following information, which is intended to complete that contained in my despatch No. 102 of the 24th May last. I must emphasise, however, that the indirect enquiries which I have caused to be made have been quite unofficial, so that the resulting information, though I believe it to be correct, must be regard ed with reserve. 2. Nothing has been heard of any six-monthly report on the lines of article 14, nor of any supplementary observations of the Inspector of Slave Affairs (who, it wil be remembered, is the Director-General of Police at Mecca). It is not laid down, however, that such reports should be pub lished. ^ 3. Certain licences ha\e been issued to slave-brokers in accordance with article 12.

After examination of text in private and long discussion Ibn Saud said he was inclined to optimism. But this is obviously based on his belief that in the long run His Majesty’s Government cannot decide partition to be either just or practicable. Moreover the optimism is tempered by his fear that atmosphere in Palestine is unfavourable to the work of proposed com- nnssKm. The publication of despatch would help but would not be enough Many Palestinians were m exile or in prison and outrages were reported dady Suggestion by Fuad that a general amnesty might be granted imme diately he ruled out as not practical politics. Perhaps the severity of the sentences of military courts might be diminished for a beginning and some- hmg m the nature of an amnesty might be worked up to if guarantees and co-operation were assured. I believe he is already considering what he can do to help to create a better atmosphere. , J: I 1 ® ? aud . a ga in s P° ke with the greatest solemnity of peril of position ot His Majesty s Government and consequently of his own. The fire in Palestine was small but the wind of intrigue was blowing the flame straight at the living tree. Not only was he anxious on political grounds but the Palestine business was infinitely distressing to him personally For four months he had been unable to listen to broadcasts from Jerusalem because they were so pamful to him. He had decided to listen on January 3rd to the first Arabic broadcast from London and filled his tent with Arabs for the occasion. When the news was announced that an Arab had been execut ed H I Il Pa A eSt i ne h f v , f K t aS ‘^ugh the rope was round his own neck and he and the Arabs with him could not refrain from tears. At this His Maiestv was deeply moved and tears in the sincerity of which I at least belfeve came into his eyes. He readily admitted that the British did not punish Arabs for 188(S) ExAfifair.-Pep' 1 1 n10 their political opinions but asked whether the crimes for which they were hanging and imprisoning Arabs would have been committed if it had not been for the policy of His Majesty’s Government. I know a reply of a kind to this question but none that will convince Ibn Saud or any other Arab. 4. Despatch by bag today.

Bullard, to Mr. Eden.—(Received December 29), (No. 177), dated the 29th December 1937. Jedda, December 7, 1937. It appears that certain Arabic newspapers in Egypt published a tale, which has been reproduced in the Syrian and Iraqi press, alleging that Ibn Saud, out of deference to the feelings of Great Britain, had refused to allow a general Arab congress to be held in Mecca, and that if he persisted in this refusal a congress would probably be held in some other Arab country. I have the honour to inform you that the TJmm-al-Qura of the 3rd December denies this report in an article, which is to the following effect: — 2 . This report is entirely without foundation. No application for such a congress was ever made by any person or body of persons. It would not be unreasonable to say that such an application was made and rejected (though, in fact, nothing of the kind happened), but it is fantastic to sug gest that the application could be rejected out of deference to the wishes of the British. The rumour must have been intended to discourage and divide the Arabs at the very moment when they feel the need for concord and unity. Its author must know that the Government of His Majesty is not a negligible force and that the person of His Majesty is the cen tre of the circle of Arab countries and the symbol of Arab aims, and L1R5T conse^~ quently the dissemination of false news about Flis Majesty must profit the enemies of the Arabs and of Islam. Every keen Arab and Moslem should know the truth, that the King is not moved by caprice or covetousness; he is the man of the Arabs, conscious of his racial and religious duty and devoting himself and his possessions to the promotion of the truth and the faith. He does not like self-advertisement or propaganda. He never embarks upon any matter affecting the interests of Arabs or Moslem interests unless he is sure that he will not have to draw back unsuccessful. He has experience of the world and knows the harm of futile demonstrations. The Govern ment and the people of Saudi Arabia naturally attach the greatest import ance to the Palestine question, not from any personal ambition but because it is an Arab and a Moslem question. It is fitting that an Arab Shara' Moslem Government and a country where the divine inspiration was reveal ed and Islam originated should take anxious thought for all matters affect ing the Arabs and the Moslems in all the territories which they inhabit. On the other hand it is fitting that the country which contains the two Holy Sanctuaries and is based on piety and divine worship alone should be left to itself in such matters and safeguarded from suspicion, so that the will of God alone may be done. 3 .

Memorandum contains much that His Majesty’s Government have heard before about Anglo-Arab interests, peril of foreign intrigues, suspi cion of Arabs about Jewish ambitions and so on. Ibn Saud is, he says, much distressed about what he calls policy of severity and was about to send His Majesty’s Government a communication on that subject when despatch of December 23rd brought a ray of hope. He is prepared to do his best to induce Palestinians to put their case before new commission but feels unable to do this until His Majesty’s Government have done something to improve the atmosphere, since he advised the people of Palestine once and they were disappointed, and moreover their fears have been justified by hopes and1 I » I I I 12 ambitions published by Jews. He does not presume to advise His Majesty’s Government but suggests their consideration as preliminary steps:— (i) Stoppage of Jewish immigration until final solution is adopted or at least for two years. (ii) Prohibition of sale of land for same period. (iii) Preliminary steps towards restoration of normal conditions by diminishing severity of military courts, permitting return of exiles and deportees, pardoning persons imprisoned politically or administratively, and inviting all to co-operate with the new commission. 3. I send this without comment since His Majesty’s Government have all information required for estimate of its value. Similarly they know what I do not know, viz : whether we need help or can struggle out of Palestine marsh unaided.

Legation have received from reliable informant Arab pamphlet about “Atrocities of British colonisation in martyred Palestine’’.

Pamphlet which will be sent Jerusalem by first opportunity has article on “Martyr’’ Farhan, photograph of torn Koran alleged to have been damaged in attack on Moslem house by British police led by Jewish officer, and so on. Ibn Saud discourages distribution of political propaganda but private distribution cannot be prevented and you will realise t hat snnp^- sion of such material as this which has a sub-stratum of truth and deals with a subject on which Moslem feeling runs high is difficult and [2 grs. omit.] sought.

Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter, dated the 2nd February 1938. (E.-196/196/25.] Letter from Sir R. Bullard, to Mr. Eden.—(Received January 11, 1938), (No. 181), dated Jedda, December, 18, 1937. I have had the honour to report to you by telegram on various ques tions raised in an interview which I had with Ibn Sand on the 15th Decem ber, during a visit of forty-eight hours which he paid to Jedda. I now give a summary of the whole of the conversation. 2. His Majesty began, quite unexpectedly, with Iraq. He was wor ried at the instability and what might be called lack of continuity there. The Cabinet was divided and resignations were threatened, and some of the tribes were still hostile. I talked of the difficulties which naturally beset a country in the first stages of self-government, and said that in any case I should be surprised to hear that Saudi Arabia had any ground of complaint against the Iraq Government. Ibn Sand said that that was true. Even in the time of Hikmet Sulaiman (though he seemed relieved that that regime had come to an end) he could not say that the attitude of the Iraq Govern ment had been anything but correct towards himeslf and Saudi Arabia, but he felt that he never knew what would happen there next. For instance, there were people there who were bringing forward schemes for Palestine, not, from love of Palestine or of the Arabs, nor from friendship towards His Majesty’s Government, but from personal ambition. I concluded that he was referring to the project of Nuri Pasha’s, which is mentioned in Bagdad telegram No. 261 of the 13th Decemebr, and which formed the subject of Mr. Kelly’s despatch, of which a copy was sent to me under cover of your despatch No. 369, dated the 30th September, 1937, and this impression was confirmed when the King mentioned a scheme which Nuri Pasha had explained to Sheikh Hafiz Wahba in Egypt some time ago; but, as will be seen later, Ibn Saud had also heard of another palestine scheme affecting Iraq. I sent a telegram to the Foreign Office on this point, No. 97, dated the 16th December. 3. The King then spoke of the Italians, of whom he seemned to be no less suspicious than he was when he talked to Mr. Rendel and myself in March. They were always interfering, now in one country, now in another. Look at the Yemen! After the publication of the Italo-Yemeni Treaty not long ago, he wrote to the Imam and asked whether there was anythin^ behind what was published. The Imam assured him that there was nothing and he believed the Imam, who was a clever, wide-awake man; but he would not answer for the Imam’s sons, nor for the Yemeni officials. 4. The next subject was arms. Ibn Saud said that, as His Majesty's Government knew, he had tried to treat the Italian offer of arms in such a way as not to place himself under an obligation by acceptance and yet not to offend the Italians. The offer of Italian rifles he had eventually refused, 118 f ExAfiairsDepton the ground that his forces were equipped with Mausers, and that to in troduce some weapons of a new type would complicate the rearmament ques tion. The Italians then said that they would get him any kind of rifles he liked, e.q., Mausers from Austria or Germany. The King then pleaded poverty, but the Italians said that that need not worry him, they would arrange easy terms. Keeping to his delaying tactics, the King said that if they would provide samples he would study the matter; and there the matter rested for the moment. Had he done right? What would His Majesty’s Government say? I repeated more or less what Sheikh Hafiz Wahba had already heard at the Foreign Office. His Majesty’s Government had pro vided all the arms which their own urgent needs enabled them to spare. If it had been within their power they would gladly have supplied more, but it was not. Ibn Baud was the sole judge of his own requirements in the matter of arms. It would evidently be better if he could have recourse to neutral supplies rather than to a Government like the Italian, which presumably, as His Majesty had himself said, was not offering cheap arms out of pure love for Saudi Arabia, but if in the end he could not escape the Italian offer, he would at least be acting with his eyes open. Ibn Saud said that he would continue to delay as far as he could, but there usually came a time in such cases where a decision could no longer be postponed. However, he would see what he could do. 5. I mention here that, according to a statement which Fuad Hamza had made to me the day before, the Italians wanted to sell Italian guns and anti-aircraft guns, in fact, any war material Ibn Saud might want as well as Mauser rifles. 6. Passing then to aviation, Ibn Saud said that he much wanted to get rid of the Italians. He realised that to replace them by British or French might create an awkward situation, but replacement by Moslems would not be open to the same objection. Could His Majesty’s Government suggest some suitable man from Egypt or Iraq for this purpose? I asked whether what His Majesty wanted was a trained air-force man to take charge of Saudi aviation, and after some talk His Majesty explained that he would like a sort of chief of staff to advise on all arms, and that, failing that, he would be glad to have an expert to take charge of aviation. I promised to report this desire to His Majesty’s Government at once, and I have done so in my telegram No. 99, dated the 16th December. From the tenor of the conversation, I assume that Ibn Saud would apply to the Government con cerned for the loan of a suitable expert if he could first have tha nrhruiu uf II ir Majesty’s Government as to the character and capacity of some possible candidates. I could see objections to the proposal, and felt sceptical as to the advantage, other than the elimination of the Italians, which Ibn Saud might expect to obtain if it were carried out; but we have had to blow cold upon so many Saudi aviation schemes that I did not want to be discouraging about this one at the outset, the more so as there is nothing to prevent the King’s applying to Egypt or Iraq without consulting us, in which case some quite unsuitable person might be sent here. 7. No reference was made by Ibn Saud to the alleged offer of a Soviet air mission (your despatch No. 413, dated the 1st November). This did not surprise me, for when I had mentioned the subject to Sheikh Yusuf Yasin the day before, he had expressed ignorance and surprise, and after making enquiry had told me that no such offer had been made and that Sheikh Hafiz must have misunderstood something much vaguer as to which he would get the papers from Mecca. I have no more information on this point at pre sent, but it seems clear that there is no question of the acceptance of a Soviet air mission by Ibn Saud. 8. The King then talked at length about Palestine. The views he expressed were summarised in my telegram No. 98, dated the 16th Decem ber. He was not violent, or even reproachful, but very anxious about his own position as being dependent on that of His Majesty’s Government. He said more than once, as he has said before, that while he objected to thepartition scheme as an Arab and a Moslem, he objected to it also because lie felt it would be ruinous to His Majesty’s Government and therefore dangerous to himself. At one point he said he would rather that the British mandate should last for another century. I employed the familiar argu ments in favour of partition, especially the one which has always appealed to me personally (provided that frontier less unfavourable to Arabs than those suggested in the report of the Royal Commission could be found), that a limitation by territory would be more stable and more likely to be final than a limitation by population, but the King said that, on the contrary, he believed that the creation of a separate Jewish State would be a perpetual irritant and source of danger. But, indeed, he seemed unable to believe that partition would ever be effected. 9. The King asked whether I had seen the reply which he had caused to be given to the accusation that out of deference to the feelings of His Majesty’s Government he had refused to allow an Arab conference to be held in Mecca. I said that I had seen it in the Umm-al-Qura (see my des patch No. 177, dated the 7th December), and that it seemed, if I might say so, to have been drafted with His Majesty’s usual wisdom. Ibn Saud said that in spite of the denial there was something in the report. It had been suggested that there should be a secret conference about Palestine in Mecca, but he had refused to allow it, alleging that Mecca was a place for religious worship, not for political conferences. That was, in fact, one of his reasons, but. of course, he had others; he never embarked upon any policy until he was sure it was reasonable, and he did not wish to embarrass His Majesty’s Government. And besides, if the holding of a conference had been the course to pursue, he would have proposed it himself and not fol lowed the suggestions of others. 10. Here the King revealed again a secondary anxiety, viz., that His Majesty’s Government would come to some arrangement about Palestine with someone else in the Arab world, or come to some fresh decision without his knowledge, and thus damage his prestige irretrievably. There was, he said, a story going about to which many were giving credence, that His Majesty’s Government proposed to declare a cessation of Jewish immigra tion into Palestine and to hand the country over to the Iraq Government, who would then, as part of the bargain, open Palestine to unrestricted im migration by Jews. He said that he had always been frank with His Majesty’s Government, and he hoped they would always be frank with him. T described the scheme he had mentioned as fantastic in itself and incredible for two other reasons. In the first place partition was still the declared policy of His Majesty’s Government, though, of course, no one could foresee what the recommendations of the forthcoming commission would be, and in the second, His Majesty’s Government appreciated the complete frankness and sincerity with which His Majesty had always acted in the matter of Palestine, and I was sure they would never take any serious deci sion on the subject without giving him the earliest possible notice. 11. Ibn Saud said he wished that some policy could be found which would not place His Majesty’s Government in opposition to the Arabs. The one question of Palestine apart, the interests of His Majesty’s Govern ment and the Arabs were identical, but the Arabs found themselves facing the Jews, whom they could easily deal with as Jews alone, and behind the Jews they found the British, and conflict was inevitable. The Arabs knew well and execrated the treatment of the Arabs in Libya by the Italians both before and after the war, and no one could have believed a year ago to what extent Mussolini would induce the Arabs to look upon him as their cham pion. His success was entirely due to the British policy in Palestine. 12. At the time of the interview I had not received the instructions con veyed in your telegram No. 110, dated the 15th December, which arrived after Ibn Saud had left Jedda, but, as will be seen from what I have said, I anticipated your assurance that there was nothing fresh to say, and that, if there was, he would be told as soon as possible. I also anticipated your16 message about the necessity for mutual comprehension of each other's diffi culties by the two Governments. I asked His Majesty whether he had not found, as he rose from being ruler of Riyadh to his present high position, that at every stage the points of contact with the world increased and poli tical questions became more complicated, and when the King said that this was so, I asked whether he could not believe that the affairs of Great Britain, coming as she did into touch with many countries which did not concern Saudi Arabia seriously and having possessions all over the world, were even more complicated than His Majesty’s. Ibn Saud pondered a moment as though the matter had not struck him in that light before and said that he agreed, and I hope that the argument helped to convince him of the truth of my assurance, that it was not from failure to give careful attention to his proposals that His Majesty’s Government had not been able to decide upon a policy more satisfactory from his point of view. 13. The matters other than politics which were touched upon at the interview are dealt with in my despatch No. 182, dated the 18th December. Throughout the interview Ibn Saud showed the friendliness and desire to co-operate with His Majesty’s Government which were shown during the talks in March last when Mr. Rendel was here. 14.

There is to be set up a religious committee in Jedda with authority to examine such persons and any documents which they may produce in support of their claims, and to issue a decree, where the conversion is adjudged to be genuine, which will authorise the convert to proceed to the Holy Cities. 2. As you are aware, there have been several cases during the last few years where persons claiming to have been converted to Islam have been detained in Jedda for considerable periods while their claims were being examined, and at least one case, that of Mrs. Sterling, an American lady (Jedda Report for February 1936 paragraph 76) permission to proceed to Mecca was eventually refused. Article 4 of the law reserves to the Saudi Arabian Government “the absolute right to refuse permission to enter the two sanctuaries to any person suspected of political, military or other [ulteiior] aims”, and even were this provision wanting, no religious com mittee would issue a decree involving authorisation to enter Mecca without17 instructions from the King. Suspicion is chiefly directed against those persons who profess Islam in order to be able to visit a forbidden city, either out of love of novelty or from a desire to secure notoriety, and this suspicion will now have been strengthened by the appearance of a book enti tled “Triumphant Pilgrimage” and the discussion which it has aroused. This book, which is written by Owen Rutter, purports to give an account of the visit to Mecca of a British subject born in the United Kingdom who appears under the name of “Chale”. The real name of this man is McBryan, and his appearance in Jedda and his admission to Mecca at the last moment were chronicled in the Jedda Reports in 1936 (January para graph 36, February paragraph 76). From reviews which have appeared and from information obtained from Sarawak, where Mr. McBryan was formerly employed and whence he set out on his pilgrimage, it is evident that much of the story as related by him through Owen Rutter is untrue and that his religious professions, albeit supported by circumcision with a flint, are open to suspicion. 3. It is unlikely that the new law will make any practical change in regard to recent converts. They will still be regarded with suspicion and will have to satisfy the King before being allowed to enter either Mecca or Medina. But the fact that they will not be allowed to perform the pilgrimage as a matter of course is now laid down by law, so that recent converts may be aware before they set out upon the journey to the Hejaz of the conditions which they will have to fulfil. 4. Copies of this despatch are being sent to India and Singapore. Enclosure to Jedda, despatch No. 17 (217/271/3) of 30th January 1938, Extract from the Mecca “Umm-ul-Qura”, No. 685 of January 21st, 1938.

( 16 ) Memo, from the India Office, London, No. P. Z.-1155/1938, dated the 20th February 1938. Forwarded with the compliments of the Secretary, Political Depart ment, India Office. A copy has been sent to the Foreign Secretary, Government of India. [E.-662/662/25.]! Letter from Sir R. Bullard, to Mr. Eden.—(Received February 4), (No. 5), DATED JEDDA, JANUARY 17, 1938. I have the honour to transmit herewith a translation of a regulation published by the Saudi Government regarding compensation to workmen in “technical industrial concerns.”- The regulation is dated the 9th Sep tember, 1937, but it was not published until the 3rd December, though it was communicated to the firms concerned a few days before that date. 2. It is understood that the regulation has been drafted by Najib Salha (Personalities, No. 112) and that he has drawn his material from the com pensation laws of several other countries. The badness of the drafting, which is remarkable even for Saudi laws, is probably the compiler’s own.’ To mention only one instance: An employee who was paid 39^ Saudi riyals a month would escape the definitions in sections 4 and 5, and thus his employer would not be liable in respect of any accident that happened to him in the course of his work. Some of the other points where the drafting is defective are indicated in square brackets. 3. Judged by the standards of this country, the rates of compensation are extraordinarily high, e.q., £450 gold for permanent total disablement of a skilled workman. It is quite right that wealthy foreign companies should pay adequate compensation in such cases, and I am far from sug gesting that the rates, regarded absolutely, are too high; but they are enor mously greater than anything the Saudi Government would pay. More over, it is not certain that the victim or his next-of-kin would receive the full amount paid by the company. This doubt is founded upon the know ledge that the companies to whom this regulation applies are required by the terms of concessions to pay in gold for certain personnel who do not, in fact, receive salary at those rates. For instance, the Petroleum Develop ment (Western Arabia) (Limited) have to pay to the Saudi Government £500 gold per annum in respect of the supervision of their concession by Najib Salha, and £20 gold per mensem for an “inspector” of very low status who is supposed to watch the drilling on the Farsan Islands. It is to be hoped that the analogy I have drawn is not sound and that the full compensation will go to the victim or his next-of-kin, but a little scepticism is permissible. 4. The provision most open to objection is contained in article 20, which makes the regulation retrospective. It was partly on this account, though also on account of the high rates of compensation, that the Jedda manager of the Petroleum Development (Western Arabia) (Limited) proposed to his19 principals that the regulation should be resisted; they, however, instructed him to take no action. The California Arabian Standard Oil Company, it is believed, have asked their principals for instructions. It is inevitable that in the end all companies concerned will accept the regulation without protest. It is inevitable that this poverty-striken country should try to make money out of the few foreign concessions in various ways, and it will not pay any of the companies to enter into controversy unless larger sums are at stake than are involved in the application of this regulation. 5. I am sending a copy of this despatch and enclosure to the Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in the Department of Overseas Trade (No. O. T. 3, 102/215/2). (17) Memorandum from the India Office, London, No. P. Z.-1458/1938, DATED THE 5TH MARCH 1938. Forwarded with the compliments of the Secretary, Political Depart ment, India Office. F A copy has been sent to the Foreign Secretary, Government of India. Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter, dated the 2nd March 1938. Letter from H. M.’s Minister, Jedda, No. 9, (134/399/7), dated the 19th January 1938. In my telegram No. 23, dated January 17th I had the honour to report a conversation which I had with Ibn Saud after a dinner which he gave on January 15th on the occasion of the visit of Lord Belhaven. As personal relations have considerable weight with Ibn Saud, as with Arabs in general, 1 thmK it may be useful to give you an account of this meeting between the King and Lord Belhaven, who is an old acquaintance of his. T 3 i ^ early . P art t ^ ie G reat War Lord Belhaven was emploved as a Political Officer in Iraq and as Political Agent at Kuwait and later he was sent on a mission to Ibn Saud. His mission did not last long, as he was superseded by Mr. Philby but he conceived a great liking and admiration for Ibn Saud, and when the \mirs Saud and Muhammad came to Great Britain for the Coronation he enter tamed them for some days. The Amir Saud suggested that Lord Belhaven should visit Saudi Arabia, and being in Aden on his way back from India Lord Belhaven telegraphed to say that if His Majesty would care to see him he could be in Jedda about January 13th. The King seemed verv Mad to have the message, and said that he would come down to Shumaisf some ten miles below Mecca on the Mecca-Jedda road, for a meeting. He pro posed to accommodate Lord Belhaven m a palace near Jedda, Imt did not insist when I asked to have the pleasure of entertaining Lord Belhaven who was a colleague of mine in Iraq. Lord Belhaven spent a week with me in Jedda, and on the appointed day we went to Shumaisi to meet His Majesty. 3. On arrival at Shumaisi we were shown to the Kind’s tent Lord Belhaven is sixty-six years of age and walks slowly and with difficulty, and20 it added to Ibn Sand’s obvious pleasure at the meeting that a man older than himself and far less active should pay a visit to Jedda m order to see him for an hour—had acted, in fact, as an Arab would do when passing near a friend’s tent. He sat for about half an hour in informal talk he conversation is not worth recording in detail but it may be mentioned that the King was highly amused when Lord Belhaven, referring to the improve ments in public security and in other respects, said that the King would perhaps one day restore the great dam at Ma’reb—forgetting that Ma re j is in the Yemen. When Lord Belhaven said that the English were like the Arabs in being lovers of freedom Ibn Baud hastened to explain that the ruler did what he thought right but was under the orders of Allah like anv other Arab. I suggested that the ruler governed according to a religious constitution, and Ibn Baud accepted the phrase as accurate. In the course of this talk the King invited me to stay with him in camp next winter, it there should be normal rain to make the desert worth visiting. 4. After the King had performed the sunset prayers we reassembled for dinner, which was set out on a long table in another tent. The Amir Faisal was banished to the other end of the table with Shaikh Yusuf Yasin and two or three othei officials. At the end where the King sat were only Lord al-Kurdi, who admits that his anti-British policy is not that of his master. As a concession to us there were European dishes, but in accordance with the King’s custom all the dishes were on the table at once. One of the important items in the King’s diet was milk, which an armed slave at his elbow held constantly ready in a hideous green and white enamel mug much chipped with long service. 5. Most of the time during dinner the talk was about old times, and especially the time when Lord Belhaven visited Riyadh in lbl7. Most of the men Lord Belhaven asked about are dead; “but” said the King, waving towards a massed crowd of retainers, “their sons are probably there &gt; He then spoke of the heavy casualties in some of his battles with Ibn Rashid r and said that he embarked upon one battle with one hundred and fifty men and came off with one camel—his own, and various wounds, one of which left a finger distorted and useless. He said that of the men who helped him to take Riyadh—his first success—only three remained, and he repeated their names and the names of their fathers. 6. The dinner did not take very long, and after dinner we sat only for a few minutes, drinking coffee and talking. The King wanted to talk to me (about Palestine) and to hurry to Mecca; Lord Belhaven therefore said goodbye and withdrew. The King said goodbye to him very kindly, and spoke of him after he had gone with great appreciation and affection, as a man “with a sincere heart”. I am sure that he was touched by the visit and the unaffected friendliness of Lord Belhaven’s manner and conversa tion and I believe that the visit was in the narrow sense “useful” to His Majesty’s Government. 7. I could not help contrasting this meeting with the various functions at which I had seen Ibn Baud when Mr. Philby was present. The King talks in a familiar fashion to Mr. Philby and makes genial fun of him, but there is nothing in his manner towards Mr. Philby of that real friend liness and respect which he showed to Lord Belhaven. The fact is, I think, that Ibn Baud is telling the truth when he says that he likes the English (he would I fear include even a Representative Peer for Scotland in this definition), and that the more English they are the better he likes them. It is no recommendation to him to have become a Moslem, to imitate the Arabs by saying “God prolong your lifef” before every remark addressed to the King, or to be wearing sandals when all the other “courtiers” present are in socks and slippers and the King himself is wearing socks with “Pure wool Made in England” on the soles. 121 ( ( 18 ) (Received on the 12th March 1938, with Political Secretary’s letter No. 8, dated the 24th February 1938.) P. Z -1109/38. Enclosure in Foreign Office covering note, dated IGth February 1938 No. E.-767/196/25. Letter from H. M.’s Minister, Jedda, No. 8 (124/551/6), dated the 17th January 1938. I have the honour to transmit herewith a translation of a circular which I have received from the Ministry of foreign Affairs, asking the foreign missions not to communicate with any Saudi department except the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. This is presumably the circular about which I tele graphed to you in my telegram No. 12, dated January 10th. It does not howevei indicate that the object of the circular is the elimination of foreign propaganda by foreign missions, and I therefore despatched my telegram No 19, dated January 13th. luad Bey talked at some length about this circular in a conversation which I had' with him a few days ago, and I understood from what he said that the Saudi Government would refer openly to the distribution of political literature as inconsonant with the character of the Holy Land of Islam, but I was perhaps mistaken. The form of the circular is highly discreet, but I do not see why, when taken with the measures to which Fuad Bey referred in talking to me, it should not have considerable success in limiting Italian propaganda. As I men tioned in my report on the interview with Ibn Saud on January 4th (my des patch No. 1 of January 5th) the King said that he suppressed propaganda newspapers, etc., whenever they were discovered, and Fuad Bey informed me that the authorities had detected and put a stop to the practice by which t e employees of the Italian Legation gave propaganda newspapers to the baudi postmen to distribute on their rounds. It appears that the Kino- was particularly incensed by the impudent piece of propaganda to which refer ence is made in Mr. Trott’s despatch No. 159 of October 11th, 1937 where a man formerly employed in a minor post in the Jedda Customs, who was a leged to ha\e spoken in Eritrea in favour of the Fascist regime, was re presented by the Italians as being Director-General of Customs in Saudi Arabia.. 2. However discreet the wording of the circular I am confident that a serious attempt will be made to prevent the Italian Legation from spread ing propaganda in this country. Measures are to be taken, Fuad Bev assures me, to prevent the use of the posts and the telephone for propaganda purposes, and orders are to be given to Saudi officials not to mix with mem- bers of foreign missions except on official occasions. Thus the interpreter oi the Italian Legation, Muhammad Ali Darfer, who it is believed is to be posted to Mecca, will be discouraged from visiting any officials except those of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or to hand propaganda to them, though it still remains to be seen whether the authorities will find means to pre vent the distribution of propaganda newspapers in the street or to restrain Monsieur Darfer from visiting private persons in Mecca in’ order to spread propaganda for his Government. 3. It is to be hoped that the provisions of the circular will be applied exclusively to what Fuad Bey declares to be their real object and will not be used to hamper our pilgrimage work. It will be remembered that this Legation had noticed a tendency on the part of the Saudi authorities to compel the Indian Vice-Consul to apply for assistance to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs instead of the local authorities concerned—a procedure which would have greatly reduced his usefulness. The recently appointed Indian V ice-Consul has not noticed any such tendency, and indeed he receiv ed a warm welcome and promises of help from the Minister of Finance- 188(S) ExAffairsDept.22 who is in charge of the pilgrimage. I am therefore hopeful that any diffi culties which the Legation experienced in this respect during the last season or two were personal to the late Vice-Consul and vanished with his depar ture, and at present I do not fear that under cover of the present regulation the difficulties will begin again.. 4 I am sending copies of this despatch and enclosure to His Majesty’s Ambassadors at Cairo (No. 125/551/6), and Bagdad (No. 127/551/6), and to His Excellency the High Commissioner for Palestine and Trans-Jordan (No. 126/551/6). Enclosure to Jedda despatch No. 8 (124/551/6) of January 17th, 1938. No. 101/18/4. Translation. Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mecca, 9th HhuT Qaa’da 1356. 10th January, 1938. Circular. I have the honour to explain to Their Excellencies the Ministers Pleni potentiaries and the Charges d’Affaires, that the Government of His Majesty the King, being desirous of facilitating the work of the Legations at Jedda had previously adopted a number of measures in order to enable them to maintain touch with this Ministry, and to carry out the formalities which the said Legations may require from it. It has been observed that on some occasions, official formalities are carried out between certain Legations and other offices instead of with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs direct, and since the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is the official channel of communi cation between the Legations and the Government of His Majesty the King, I beg that this rule may be observed, and any action contrary to it avoided. In order to increase facilities of communications between the Legations • and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Government of His Majesty think it fitting that Shaikh Ibrahim ibn Muammar, the Qaimmaqam of Jedda, shall be entrusted, in addition to his original duties, with the function of receiving the urgent statements or messages which the Legations may desire to communicate speedily to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and also that Shaikh Ali Taha, the assistant of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs shall remain attached to him in connection with the work of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This new arrangement will complete the arrangements previously made for the presence of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, or of his Deputy, in Jedda, and for meeting the [foreign] representatives there, and I trust that the result of the same will assist all of us in strengthening the relations and the bonds of friendship which happily exist between us.

Cypher telegram from Sir R. Bullard (Jedda), No. 19, dated the 13th January 1938. Important. My telegram No. 12. Circular received from Ministry of Foreign Affairs asks foreign missions to communicate only with the Ministry adding that it has been observed that on some occasions formalities take place between certain Lega tions and other offices. This is presumably the one to which Fuad referred. I understood him to say that the reasons for the circular would appear in it but I may have been mistaken. [Gp. undec.] discreet approach seems preferable, and in any case I have no doubt Saudi authorities are serious in their intention to restrict Italian propaganda. Amongst measures men tioned by Fuad were prevention of use of posts and telephones for propa ganda and orders to Saudi officials not to mix with members of foreign missions except on official occasions. ( 20 ) (Received on the 2nd April 1938, with Political Secretary' s letter No. 11, dated the 17th March 1938.) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter dated the 15th March 1938. [E.-1099/10/31.] Letter from Sir R. Bullard, to Mr. Eden.—(Received February 28), (No. 21, Confidential), dated Jedda, February 2, 1938. As you are aware, it is extremely difficult to find out what people are thinking in this country. Contact with the local inhabitants, which has always been rare, has ceased altogether since the promulgation of the orders designed to circumscribe Italian propaganda on which I reported in my despatch No. 8, dated the 17th January, 1938, and in any case discipline is too strictly maintained by the King for Saudi subjects to speak freely to members of foreign Legations on lines which he might not approve. For these reasons I think it worth while to transmit to you the attached extract from a conversation which I had recently with M. Naidyonoff, the “White’’ Russian pilot employed by the Saudi Government. 2. The conversation arose out of a projected flight of three Saudi planes to Wejh, which has been the subject of discussion for several weeks. One is to be piloted by the Italian, Major Ciccu, a second by M. Naidyonoff, and the third by a Saudi, and the rest of the Saudi pilots are to be carried as passengers. The party would stay some ten days in Wejh, I gather, before returning. The start has been postponed several times for lack of one thing or another, and it has now been put off again because Major Ciccu is ill. When speaking to me about this flight on the 1st February, M. Naidyonoff said that he was thinking of giving up his post here because he did not want to be involved in hostilities. A few days before he had spoken of this possibility and had said that, whatever happened, he him self, as an officer who served in the Denikin army, would never take part in hostilities against the British. On both occasions I deprecated any talk about hostilities involving Saudi Arabia and, indeed, all talk about the imminence of war, but last night M. Naidyonoff seemed greatly disturbed. As will be seen from the enclosed note, his feelings are based on nothing more solid than the attitude of the commandant of the Jedda forces, Said- al-Kurdi, who admits that his anti-British policy is not that of is master, Ibn Saud. But it is interesting to hear of the influence which the views of an unpopular man have here, because, they are anti-British and pan- Arab, and thus coincide with those of the younger Saudis, and to learn24 of the belief that, if a serious revolt broke out in Transjordan, it would attract the spontaneous participation of the Saudi tribes on the border, and when once the movement had begun Ibn Saud would have to allow it to con tinue or perhaps even to take part in it. 3. There is no doubt that at present Ibn Saud does not want anything of the sort to happen. If he had not been really attached to the view which he has professed on several occasions during the last eighteen months, viz., that his interests and those of His Majesty’s Government are identical, he would hardly have acted as he has done in regard to Palestine. The import ant question is how far he will continue to adhere to that view if there is no radical change in the Palestine policy of His Majesty’s Government. 1 have recently recorded my opinion that he continues to support His Majesty’s Government as far as he can because he cannot believe that in the long run they will carry out a policy grossly unjust (from his point of view) to the Arabs, and that his strong professions of friendship must not be regarded as a blank cheque. He has recently pointed out that his help in bringing about a restoration of order in Palestine so that the Royal Com mission could carry out its work, and later in inducing the Palestine Arabs to give evidence, resulted in disappointment for the Arabs, and has said that while he is ready to assist in bringing about an atmosphere in which the technical commission can begin its labours he cannot this time take the initiative. In fact, he assisted His Majesty’s Government and the Arabs got nothing out of it (again from their point of view, and his), and whereas last time he gave his assistance because of his general belief in the “justice” of His Majesty’s Government, he cannot afford to do that again. Of course, it may be that His Majesty’s Government have no further need of his good offices. I am not assuming that they are necessary to His Majesty’s Gov ernment, but am merely using the history of Ibn Baud’s attitude on the point to show that his position seems to have become more difficult ru o aS seems . ^ V ident, the Palestine question has gradually forced Ibn baud i^to a position where he cannot be as helpful as he would like to be to His Majesty’s Government, can it be guaranteed that, if the situation does not soon turn more to the advantage of the Arabs, he will not be obliged to tecome I es s and less friendly ? I would not give any such guarantee, fnd I thinlc it would be a mistake to trade too far upon his wish to maintain the ^riendhest relations with His Majesty’s Government. What will con stitute in Arab eyes a favourable turn is a difficult problem, but I fear that no scheme which does not call a final halt to Jewish expansion in Palestine in some way or other will have a chance of acceptance by the Arabs. I must admit that I myself favoured partition as a solution even before the Roval Commission began its work, as placing a limit on Jewish expansion in 'the most definite way Whether the suggested scheme of partition would have aroused less hostility among the Arabs if the reservations made in the despatch of the 23rd December, 1937, had appeared in the Statement of 1 diicy in July is an academic question, but of the strength of the hostility now there is no doubt. The mam difficulty is perhaps the complete dm belief which Arab spokesmen profess to have in the ability of His Maiesty’s Government to keep the Jews within any limits which may be fixed Ibn Saud does not go so far as to say that His Majesty’s Government are under the thumb of the Jew, but he has expressed a vehement surprise at what he considers the unnatural and, indeed, irreligious combination of the Jews with His Majesty s Government And the religious factor has great in- fluence with him, both because of his personal convictions and of his vulne rabihty to criticism, both at home and abroad, on this score 5. These remarks have grown out of what may well seem the foolish vapourings of a pan-Arab visionary of no influence. I do not share th^ view that the flight of six Saudi aeroplanes along the border would suffice to cause a revolt m Transjordan, but the suggestion that a revolt in Tran, Jordan might attract Saud, tribes and eventually win the acquiescence if not the support of Ibn Saud, is not necessarily to be scouted forever because we can scout it for the moment. ■ ause6.

Enclosure. Extract from a Note on a Conversation with M. Naidyonojf. The pilot, Ciccu, is ignored by the Saudi pilots, who do not even say. good-morning to him (? on orders from the King). When Naidyonoff asks them why this rudeness they indicate that they don’t want any Italians. But one form of insult is no longer inflicted on Ciccu : he used to have to walk to the aerodrome, but Abdullah Sulaiman (Minister of Finance and Director of Defence) has now supplied him with a car. The only person who is friendly to Ciccu is Said-al-Kurdi, who is learning Italian from him, because, he says, it is bound to be useful in the next, war, whichever side Saudi Arabia is on. Said-al-Kurdi is the only person who has a glimmering of understand ing of aviation, its uses, needs, limitations, etc. Abdullah Sulaiman is hopeless, but Kurdi listens, and also learns from experience. Kurdi is always telling Naidyonoff that if only the Saudi aeroplanes could fl} along the Transjordan frontier, so that the tribes there could see that the Saudis had an air force, there would be an immediate rising in Transjordan, which would spread to Palestine, and the Saudi tribes would take part. Naidyonoff asked Kurdi whether this was Ibn Saud’s policy. Kurdi said no, but if the movement started he would not stop it, but would have to back it up. Kurdi is very unpopular, but he is a single-minded fanatic on this subject and the young people listen to him. There is a tremendous amount of propaganda of this kind going on, designed to show that times are very difficult for His Majesty’s Government and that the opportunity should not be lost. Naidyonoff said that we ought to watch “night and day” in Trans jordan. ( 21 ) (Received on the 9th April 1938, with Political Secretary's letter No. 12, dated the 2Mh March 1938.) Copy.

If specimens are satisfactory orders may be passed. The message was accompanied by an assurance from the King that no material advantage would ever affect his friendship for His Majesty’s Government.

The Saudi Arabian Government were rather disturbed at the news about negotiations with Italy and I thought it well to convey assurance to them at once. They have replied in a note which will follow by bag. The chief point is an enquiry whether the Rome understanding of 1927 will be discussed and if so, whether His Majesty’s Government will persist in respecting it. I have reminded Fuad of recent assurances on this point and of the importance which the Italian Government also seem to attach to it and have said that I cannot imagine conversations having any result if successful but to confirm and even strengthen guarantee which the under standing affords to Saudi Arabia. The assurance just given should be- sufficient as Fuad realises but to allay Ibn Baud’s nervousness you may like to make a specific statement on the point he raises.

The Amir Khalid was the son of the King’s brother Muhammad. He was reputed to be a determined enemy of his cousin the Amir Saud, the heir apparent who took him with him wherever he went—even on the recent visit to Bahrain—and kept a close watch on him. There will be those who will try to find something sinister in the story of the accident, and the omission of the cause of death from the official announcement may do something to strengthen this suspicion. I may mention in this connec tion that when the Amir Saud was with the Athlone party on the shooting expedition at Rumhiya, Mr. Gault noticed that when the Amir said his prayers with his followers and the other Arabs in the camp, an armed man who did not take part in the prayers stood behind him the whole time. 3 When the news appeared in the Mecca press I telegraphed my condo lences to the Amir Faisal, as Minister for Foreign Affairs, but I did not think the matter suitable for the British Broadcasting Corporation Arabic broadcast and therefore did not send the news for inclusion in the new&amp; bulletin. (24) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter dated the 5th May 1938. Letter from H. M.’s Minister, Jedda, No. 68 (765/270/2), dated the 11th April 1938. I have the honour to report the publication in the “Umm-al-Qura” of April 1st of a “Regulation concerning the wholesale and retail trade in medicines, drugs, medical preparations and herbs”. The regulation, which27 must have been copied straight from the statute-book of some highly orga nised state, is far too elaborate to be applied properly in this country, and I should hardly have thought it worth reporting but for one article which reads as follows :—• Article 21. The sale of proprietary medical preparations imported from abroad is prohibited, unless previous permission for the sale has been obtained, and the Public Health Department shall not authorise the sale without first taking specimens and ascertaining the composition, the effective medical substances which they contain, and the method of use. 2. Such British proprietary medical articles as to be found in this country must have a very small sale, but as even that small sale may be held up,if only for a time, by the promulgation of this regulation, I have thought the matter worth reporting. 3. A copv of this despatch is being sent to the Department of Overseas Trade [No. 11. (766/270/2]. (25) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter, dated the 12th May 1938. [E.-1701/196/25.]! Letter from Sir R. Bullard, to Viscount Halifax.—(Received March 28), (No. 46), dated Jedda, March 11, 1938. I have the honour to inform you that Ibn Saud summoned me to a final audience to-day before his departure for Mecca and thence to Nejd for his annual holiday. I was thus able to convey in person to the King, as well as by letter to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, the congratulations on the discovery of oil in Hasa which you sent in your telegram No. 37, dated the 9th March. The King was much pleased at this mark of sympathy and expressed his appreciation and thanks. I have since received a letter in the same sense, written on the King’s behalf, from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. 2. What with the visit of Her Royal Highness Princess Alice and Lord Athlone, every detail of whose journey he follows personally with the great est interest, and the discovery of oil, the King was in an excellent humour. He talked a good deal about European politics, going to pieces over names like Czechoslovakia, but showing a shrewd knowledge of the situation, but he did not refer to the projected negotiations between His Majesty’s Gov ernment and the Government of Italy, as I had thought he might do. 3. Much of the talk was about the Yemen. The Imam, said the King, was always worrying about something. He made a lot out of Philby s journey, and the other day he said that the British were working up to Nejran and asked what the King was going to do about it. This seemed to amuse the King, who always seems to find the Imam slightly ridiculous. He proceeded to criticise the Yemenis as thoroughly factious and savage and untrustworthy, and related various incidents in support of this thesis. He then talked about the Hadhramaut in the sense of the communication from Fuad Bey which I have reported in my despatch No. 39, dated the 8th March. I hope to have time before the bag closes to give the gist of the King’s remarks as a postscript to that despatch. 4. The King repeated the kind invitation which he gave me on the occasion of Lord Belhaven’s visit (my despatch No. 9, dated the 19th Jan uary) to spend some time with him in the desert next spring, if the rains should be good. As he pressed for a reply, I could only say that, if His Majesty did not mind my being no great sportsman, I should be very glad to come. It seemed to me that I might do more good in camp with the King for a week or so, than sitting at a desk in Jedda, and I trust that you will approve my general acceptance of the invitation.28 ( 26 ) D.

It was entitled “The Future of Arabia” and dated the 18th September 1931. I made an addition to it dated the 23rd February '1933 in regard to Kuwait. 3. I entirely agree with you that so long as Ibn Saud lives there is rot much likelihood of a serious revolt, but as he gets older he may not be able to carry on his “one man show” with the vigour he displays at present, and the Arabs have a grim proverb : “When the camel stumbles {i.e., gets past its work) out comes the knife. ^ I am sending a copy of this letter to Metcalfe and Peel.

It is now possible to complete the story of the death of the Amir Khalid, nephew to Ibn Sand, which I had the honour to report to you in my despatch No. 64 (715/391/8), dated April 4th. The details given in the Kuwait Intelligence Summary for March 16th to 31st bear out the information obtained from Shaikh Hafiz Wehba, who was in Nejd at the time. A violent check to the car which he was driving at high speed flung the Amir against the wind-screen with such force that he died of his injuries a few days later, but he lived long enough to be seen alive by an American Mission ary doctor who had been sent for from Kuwait. 2. The Hejazi malcontent whose complaints I reported in my despatch No 78 (875/287/14), dated April 24th declared that the death of the Amir Khalid was not due to an accident, but had been planned long beforehand. The death of the chief rival to the Heir Apparent might well appear to hostile Arab eyes too fortunate to be accidental, and the fact that the cause of death was not mentioned in the reports in the Mecca press could be quoted as addi tional evidence. I do not think that any unprejudiced person here would accept the theory of a planned murder, but with persons so closely protect ed by armed guards as Ibn Saud or the Amir Saud, a hasty gesture of anger by a known enemy might possibly be misinterpreted by an armed slave and provoke a fatal shot or dagger-thrust. However, there is no question of this m the present case.. I ( 28 ) Foreign Office, E.-2829/150/91. Reference demi-official letter P. Z.-2887/38, May 3rd. With Mr. Baxter’s compliments. J. P.

Fuad Hamza seemed to take particular care not to say how many there were, and I have never heard an exact figure from any other source, though “eight to twelve” has been mentioned. There is an Italian here who arrived with the guns and is possibly an artillery instructor. Fuad said, it will be remembered (Jedda telegram No. 54 of March 5th), that the con signment would be accompanied by Italians to expalin the use of the arms. This Italian is said to be very assiduous in his attentions to the Command ant, and he does not appear in the European community, though Trott met him once at the Iraqi Legation. Confidential.

No. (26)], dated May 25th which has led me to look up your “Future of Arabia” of September 18th, 1931. It has always been supposed, I think, that the Saudi regime was very much a one-man show and that anything might happen if Ibn Saud died, so that when I wrote my despatch No. 78 of April 25th I felt that I was expounding the obvious. But the despatch arose out of the complaints of the Hejazi I quoted, and moreover I had been thinking about the possible effect on Saudi Arabia of a steady revenue from31 i *► 4 . oil which might enable the ruler to pension all Nejd out of oil money and to leave the pilgrims to the Hejazis. I dealt with the point in a later des patch No. 83-E. (908/284/3) of April 30th last. What matters however, it seems to me, is what is to be done (1) now, in view of the Palestine tangle, and (2) if we become involved in a world conflict while Ibn Saud is still alive. I wish I could feel certain that no such conflict will come upon us within the next ten years, which is not an un reasonable period to give Ibn Saud: he may live and reign effectually for even longer. I am sending a copy of this letter, and of yours, to Baxter. (31) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter, dated the 20th August 1938. [E.-4187/196/25.] Letter from Sir R. Bullard, to Viscount Halifax.—(Received July 15), (No. 132), dated Jedda, June 28, 1938. I have the honour to enclose herewith a translation of an interesting announcement from the Umm-al-Qura, reporting that at a conference held in Riyadh in May it was agreed that a Higher Council of State should be set up and that the military system of the country should be reorganised on a more regular basis. 2. Why the new council is to be called the Higher Council of State is not made clear. There is at present a Legislative Assembly, and a stand ing committee of the Council of Ministers. The Legislative council seems to deal only with administrative, never with political questions. The other body apparently serves by standing, for, according to Fuad Bey, who is a member of it. it does nothing else. The High Council of State is apparently to be consulted on political matters, since it is to consider “public affairs touching the State and its preservation.’’ While Ibn Saud makes his own decisions, he is quite right in claiming, as he has done on occasion, that he first listens to advice, and he listens to it openly in a manner which the European Dictators would consider ruinous to their reputations. It is, I think, legitimate to suppose that the council will be a safety-valve for its members, who can give their opinions on Palestine and the Arab world and European politics, and for the King a formal means by which he can make his opinions and decisions on questions of high policy known to the people. 3. In view of the forecast made in paragraph 3 of my despatch No. 103-E., dated the 22nd May, it is interesting to see that a standing army trained on more or less modern lines is to be created with the aid of oil revenues—for that is evidently the “economic resources’’ Ibn Saud has in mind. We have never been told what reply Ibn Saud returned to the Iraq proposal for the introduction of some measure of unification in the training and equipment of the two armies, but it is probable that that proposal will be taken into account when the tens of thousands of Arabs are assembled, clad in unaccustomed trousers, in their barracks. It may be some little time before the collection of oil royalties allows of a serious beginning with this plan, and it is therefore early to speculate whether the proposed force will be more efficient than tribal levies, and, if so, whether it will conduce to the stability of the Saudi regime by providing the ruler for the time being with a sure protection against any attempt to overthrow him. 4. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s Ambassadors at Cairo and Bagdad, and to His Excellency the High Commissioner for Palestine at Jerusalem^Copy. (E.-4187/196/25.) Riyadh Conference for the year 1357. Establishment of a Higher Council of State, and a new Military Organisation in Nejd, (from the Umm-al- Qura of the 2Mh June, 1938). Our readers are aware that His Majesty the King is accustomed to call a general meeting every year at the time when crowds of people come to see him at Riyadh. Sometimes reports of this annual conference have been published, sometimes not. This year the conference was held about the middle of Rabi’-al-Awwal (about mid-May). It was attended by the amirs of the royal family, the ulama, important officials and thinking men. His Majesty the King, who presided over the conference, reviewed the home and foreign situation, and explained to all present the need for caution and watchfulness, and for the adoption of such preparations as are commanded by the Quran. His Majesty also set forth the necessity to consider two matters for the maintenance of the state internally and externally. The first is the establishment of a Higher Council of State, to be con stituted in accordance with a special law, to consider public affairs touch ing the state and its preservation. The second is the examination of the Military organisation and the re placement of the present system by a new one whereby the forces in Nejd may become more useful and effectual. This can only be effected by giving troops a scientific training in special barracks so that there may (always) be under training some tens of thousands of men (ready) to move at the order of their commander-in-chief in any direction, supported by the reserve forces in the country. His Majesty stated that he had only been prevented from putting this proposal into effect earlier by the shortage in the state revenue, and that, believing that this financial crisis would now be resolved by the revenue to be expected from economic resources in this country, he thought it necessary to hurry on with the business. His Majesty’s statements were received by all with delight and joy, and his proposals were unanimously supported and approved. His Majesty therefore issued orders for the necessary preparations to be made to put the two schemes into effect. We pray that Allah may bestow on this country and other Arab coun tries what may strengthen Islam and Moslems in general and the Arabs in particular, and that he may preserve His Majesty and keep him as a treasure to Islam and to the Arabs.
