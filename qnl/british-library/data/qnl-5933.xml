Dated (Drafted and encyphered on 9th November and signalledon) Your telegram No.801 arrived after my conversation with Minister last night. all the old ground, the loss to Iraq revenues, the costly preventive service etc. ending up, but rather weakly I thought, on the 'By Jingo' note. To all this I made little or no coiment. had found this had been said at intervals in the last year or so, notably by Yassin Pasha, but no evidence had been produced to substantiate what T ould by now be a flood of arms. If there were you would take a most serious view of it. 4. His Excellency said he would telegraph to Baghdad from Riyadh to ask if any evidence could be produced. 5. The Minister at this point showed that he thought there was no control over arms in the Gulf and appeared surprised that steamers could not land arms without pemissior 6 . That he said now troubled him only was the Mutasarrif’s report that the Shaikh had recently gathered his people and told them that his restriction on arms export to Iraq last Spring was now cancelled and encouraged them to 10th November 19 36 . 1. . First and in general His Excellency went over 2 . He then while admitting a great decrease in smuggling mentioned the increase in gun running. 3. I pointed out that having looked at my papers I- 2 - 7# ais ^cellency said he heard in Baghdad that there was likelihood of an agreement between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait and perhaps a similar agreement might be made between ^raq and Kuwait. I replied non-committally. 8 * : ' e that he hoped on his return to Kuwait to discuss whole matter again. Minister list night. C ° Vel,S P ° intS Clentiorl ^ Foreign ?lliE mornin g however he said that after a discussion with the ohaikh he was convinced the Mutasarrif's report and other reports about arms smuggling were entirely erroneous and as soon as he reached Hiyadh he would telegraph to Ba-hdad to say so and that the Ruler had said he was quite willing to re-emphasize by public notice his forbiddance of arms export which was most satisfactory and would make the Cabinet happy. 10 . The Minister who left today is due in Kuwait about the 19th November but dare not owing to home politics, ;ait '*or the Hon’ble the Hesident due on the 24th. 11 • 1 am l Q ^t with the impression that all he requires is something accomplished here to go back with to Baghdad and if he has something to show then the recent wilder accus ations which policy may have dictated but facts do not support may be abandoned and relations improved. 12.

Uoreovar sniggling such as exists will be nuch reduces, as soon as legitimate tr?:de with Hejd is reopened and then the atmosphere should be unaffected by reports of smuggling during the exchanges of letters; for by letters through the The Hon’ble Lt.-Colonel T.C.iTowle,0.13.3. , Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, HUUHIH 2 .through the ordinary chaiiiiel and interviews, unsuccessful conferences X think: any arrangement of the ttlnd should be made* departmental tactics I feel that to make an iraq-iCu ait agreement copend upon a successful issue to the naudi iirab—Kuwait agreenexit may stimulc te the ^’orei Office, encouraged by the ^rabasscdor,Baghdad as thi$' wouIq be, to greater efforts on behalf of the latter agreement. It is too X think only dien the haudi Arab side is regulated that the shaikh woula feel himself, having given his people an opening for legitimate trade in that direction, able to agree to a regulation of traffic with Iraq, and not with Iraq now, but the greater natural trade, if no blockade, being with ±.ejci. rather then awkward, and here almost proverbially 5. further if only as a matter of vice versa or simultaneously, most smuggling being as it now seems to be known to the Iraq10 /- • Iraq Torei^pi iiinister than an a^roemant with i^audi Arabia is in the air (I gave him only the vaguest of tiiiswers but he me evidently fairly sure of the facts and may discover more in Riyadh) it would seem useless to deny anc a pity to avoid the opportunity of placing it before us as an objective - ana an objective asiced for by the Iraq foreign Minister - should the Lhaikh agree. if you took up the idos you would I think perhaps be instructing ne officially to approach the shaikh to ask if he agrees in principle to the conception of a similar agreement to the .,audi one, to be dealt with after the eignature of the c-audi . greumont. * *Vith regard to the naudi Arab-^u'. 7 eit trade agreoraant, 1 venture to suggest, particularly now that an Iraq agreement is mooted, that it would be a good thing if the ‘•‘oroign Office could hasten with it to e conclusion.4 - i i 10. iiOiae little persuasion and appeal ni^ht overcome the Kind’s objections to para 1 of the draft as it stood - particularly as the agreement is only to be for a quite limited period - on trial.

His majesty’s ambassador has telegraphed as follows to Foreign uf^ice, No.289(r) begins: (Text of I.0.Tel.3338 of even date):- In a recent talk Prime Minister assured me of the desire of Iraqi Government to settle questions concerning Kuwait. He showed special interest in ’Smuggling* and invited me to put forward proposals ,(£those for) control of smugglii^ from ^uwait to Saudi Arabia might offer basis for agreement between Kuwait end Iraq. Is there any objection to my giving general outline of draft regulations enclosed with (Political) Agent, Kuwait’s despatch of May 14th to Political Resident in the Persian Gulf end asking his views? Mnds. Political Resident in the Persian ^ulf and Kuwait only. This sounds encouraging anc subject to your observations, tT is majesty’s Government are prepared to authorise Ambassador to act accordingly. I suggest you confirm from Shaikh on November 24th that he sees no objection. 2. Possible danger seems to be that Iraq Gove mm nt were informed thax similar proposals were unaer discussion with Saudi Government they might be taupted to concert with latter thus complicating and delaying both sets of2 sets of negotiations. But summary proposals can presumably be put to Iraq Government as part of comprehensive settlement of xbuwai t-uraq frontier difficulties (See Foreign Office telegram to Baghdad of November 19th, No.26B and your telegram November 6th, No.791) without necessarily mentioning parallel negotiations Saudi Government.

The Minister looked tired and was in quieter mood than when he left for Riyadh, nevertheless he started in very airy fashion to talk about our arran 'inf' forthwith 'a gentlemen’s agreement'. &gt;Ve could decide now and confirm later in ^a^dadl /ould the Shaikh now not take active steps to stop smuggling? 2. I dropped him drown as gently es I could into the basement of reality from this rare altitude. '6* 1 said 1 could only speak privately. 4. The Minister said that Yusif Yassin he d implied that the Saudi xvrab Trade nlookade was coning to an end and that agreement would be reached, which I thought a hopeful sign worth noting. Unfortunately he also implied in a vague sort of way that Yusif Yassin ht d spoken of u simultaneous agreement Iraq- Saudi ..rabia-jvuwait, and rrientioned a moment later that Yusif Yassin had said Saudi Arabia could develop a port 'near the new Oil Field (of which he did not know the name). This is ,1 assume, has Tanoura. Naji al ^si 1 seemed to think that it was almost a ready made port and have n entirely erron«30 &lt;a idea of it. I did not gp into that story with him except to' say that has Tanoura had been talked of for long. He asked If a simultaneous Iraq-Saudi Arab agreement could not be made. I was non-corjai ttal but permitted myself to say that simultaneous agreements were, I believed, always mechanically difficult to bring off. 5. I reminded him that most of the smugglers were Iraqis (as is borne out by Iraqi Government reports) andt 2 and hinted that he might care to go into the possibilities of catching them on the Euphrates before they ever started out • 6* The iinister said that he wanted to have something satisfactory to tell his colleagues in the Cabinet when ha arrived in Baghdad. He could say he thou^it that the arms position was entirely satisfactory and that in so far as other smuggling was concerned frontier vigilance should continue.

His Majesty’s Government appreciate difficulty apprehended by Shaikh in putting into force any agreement with Iraq Government before agreement with Saudi Arabian Government is working but it a is not suggested he should do this or give a pledge of the kind referred to you in your telegram. On the other hand there does not seem to be any valid reason against starting discussions with a view to reaching agreement making ready to put into force when time comes and it seems desirable to do since Iraq Government have actually asked for proposals mainly and appear at present moment to be favourably disposed towards settlement if therefore you see no objection you should urge Bbaikh to agree to discussions being started. -Hetaxandum-Telegram H.

NAQIB hoped that Shaikh would entertain the Foreign Minister when opportunity could be taken to discuss Kuwaiti Iraqi affairs. If Shaikh did not wish to entertain the Foreign Minister he (NAQIB) would put him up in his house in Kuwait. 2. Shaikh is answering that he will be pleased to entertain Foreign Minister as his private guest but that he cannot on any account discuss Kuwait Iraqi affairs. 3.

The Shaikh told me that he had replied that he had turned no one out of Kuwait, those who had left had left of their own free will. In actual fact three men were expelled after trial; of the others some were in Basra at the time of the trouble, and some fled surreptitiously. 4, His Excellency seemed most cheerful, and had his leg pulled at lunch about wearing European dress.
