The Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Sir, I have the honour to refer to my telegram No. 28 dated the 28th March and to enclose in original together wiiL one spare copy letter addressed 'by Mr. I. Morris, Commanding the Hedjaz Air Force, to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. 2. The letter explains itself and I have only to say that I received a visit from Messrs. Hamilton and Lowe, pilots, and Mr. Gribble, a mechanic, in the above force, the same morningt They had many complaints to make regarding their conditions, and asked me to help them. They said that although Bin Saud had personally assured then that they had only to mention their requirements to have them satisfied, they got no reply to their letters, and that nothing was done. They also said that the question of a water supply was most urgent as at present they were obliged to drink from a sulphur spring in which the local inhabitants washed them- -selves, their clothes and their donkeys. They added that the present aerodrome was not safe, and that a pilot taking off with a full load of bombs would almost certainly smash his- plane* 3. Since the Chief pilot's letter was received in a confidential cover I treated it as such. I told them that I had no locus standi in the matter, and that if the Chief Pilot felt the need of materiel urgently, I would, subject to your approval, wire his requirements to the British y fmam ' !» British Agent at Jeddeli for tr nsmission to the releyant Department of the Hedjaz GoYernment. I p I so said that I woul^C ask that their contracts might be sent them as early as possible. I received one from Air Head uarters Iraq^ a short while ago, and you will perhaps be good enough to make some enquiries regarding the others. The question of an artesian well has, I believe, been taken up, but it is doubt ful if such a well will be successful at Darin as similar b/orings at Qatif had failed. 4. I then sent for Hassan Qusaibi, the only member of the firm present in Bahrain^He had intended to hol^ up the letter to the Amir, ( as you will see the letter was lit sent in triplicate, with a copy to Qusaibis and the Foreign Office ) and to try an arrange a f sulh f between the parties. It appeared to me best that early orders should be passed on the Chief Pilot's letter, since a reconciliation appeared out of the question, and I advised him to wire the main points of the letter to the Emir. I had formed the opinion some time ago that Mr. Hamilton was an undesirable character and I am sure that his retention will lead to trouble. 5. It was sufficiently unpleasant discussing such amatter with Qusaibi, but I have little hope that a clear and early decision will be given, and further un pleasantness may be expected, particularly when Mr. Hamilton learns as he eventually must, of the Chief Pilot's pro posals . The ^hief Pilot, who is a hard and keen worker, is faced with a superhuman task, fie has little hold over his Officers, and seldom receives replies to the letters he writes to his chiefs, who moreover probably do not understan what is required of ihem. They are expected to train up an Air Force on an aerodrome they consider unsafe, and have the prospect of spending the hot weather in huts with a sulphurous water supply. 6. I have no doubt that the less this Agency intervenes in their affairs the better, and their contracts, I believe preclude their approaching their Chiefs except throughthrough the proper channels# In the circjunstancesi I should be glad if you would inform me what action I should take, should the Chief Pilot request me to forward a request to his chief through the British Minister at Jeaciah, and to what extent I may assist the members of this force* I haye the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient seryant, Political Agent, Bahrain. i - t1 Telegram.

PRIVATE and GON?IDBNTIAX« KEJAZ AIR FORCE, DARIN* 4th May, 1,950i Captain C, G. Prior, His Britannic Majepty's Political Agent, Bahrain, Dear Captain Prior, Before leaving England, I w aB advised by the Foreign Office that, in the evfiut of ary trouble arising that pre sented raore than ordinary difficulty, I w^s to consult you as to the best way of overcoming it. As you know, I had occasion to suspend LT S* Hamilton frow duty on the ?,6tR March on account of his disgraceful behaviour, and requested you to take steps to ensure his non-return to Darin; you accordingly prevented his return and he is still in Bahrain. I should esteem it s favour if you would inform me, unofficially, when this individual is likely to leave Bahrain, and, incidentally, the Hejaz Air Force; I am anxious to know for several reasons, the chief one being that among our mechan ics here are several of the 'barrack-room lawyer' type, who have been cherishing for some time a grievance against the Hejaz Govern ment, and the smouldering fires of thei^vprivate grumbles were fanned into active flame by Hamilton, who sa w an excellent opportunity to turn this spirit of dissension to his own personal gain^ Thanks to your prompt action, this was, to a large extent, checked by the author being detained in Bahrain, but I have reason to believe that he is still corresponding with members of this unit and keeping the spirit of unrest alive. I am regretfully forced to believe that he is aided and a.betted in this by mother pilot, Lowe, who is also very dissatisfied with the conditions in general, yet who does little to alleviate the discomforts natural to such an enterprise as ours other than to offer destructive criticism. He informed me that several of the DBechanics had no intention of serving more than their first year, but, moreover, talked largely to 'writing to the press and doing their utmost to prevent any other Britishers coming out to such a show*, I may add that I had previously investigated all their complaints and taken every possible step to obtain redress and I am convinced that, given time,, the Hejaz Government wm do all they can to place matters on a more satisfactory footing. The agitators have an idea, instilled in the first place by Hamilton, that, at the end of their first year*s.service, they can clear out and claim two years* pay and a free passage home on the plea of - breach of contract, on the assumption that they did not receive pay until March 31st - three months in arrears, overlooking the fact, how ever, that our Agents, Messrs, Gosaibi, took steps to ensure that *e were not left destitute by paying all bills for food and offering advt ..oes of pay (in one case, accepted) until our rates of pay were received from Jiddah.Also, they complain that we were se«t to Darin instead of to Jiddah; this, I think, is covered by Ciause (Cl of enclosed copy of contract, which I am sending for your perusal as all contracts are based on this, the only difference being in mechanies* pay and duties, 1 The fact remains that there is a spi rit of grave discontent that w^g fostered and nourished in the first instance by Hamilton, whom, I discovered, even exhorted them to strike work if their 'demands' were not met.I am not certain whether the pay for April, which I informed Messrs.

Prior, I .A., Political Agent, Bahrain. The Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to refer to my telegram No. 942 dated 7th June 1930 and to forward the following report. 2. Mr. North called upon me yesterday and gave me a copy of the letter to the Amir Faisal of which I enclose a copy. 1 have asked him not to forward it until I receive telegraphic instructions, from you, so that if you consider any alteration advisable it will be possible to have it made* 3. You will see that the pilot Lowe who has just returned from Bahrain to Darin, having been in hospital here with malignant malaria, has taken up Mr. Hamilton's work of creating trouble among the mechanics, fie is an un pleasant young man with no manners, and from what i have se^ I of him I have no doubt that all that has been written about him is true. 4. Since writing the enclosed letter the Chief Pilot Morris has been ill, and Mr. North tells me that he had decided that it would be best to part with the mechanics gribble and Cairns as well since they refuse to carry out any orders given them and openly defied the Chief Mechanic Mr. Cleal, ( who Corroborated thi^,)but owing to his being unwellunwellhe tos not able to amend the letter so as to inclde thorn. 5. The whole trouble arose in the first place 'by the Chief Pilot having no disciplinary powers orer the force under his command. Even with carefully selected and reliable men this ^ould place him in a very difficult position, but will persons like Hamilton and Lowetrouble was bound to occur. It occurred to myself, Mr Belgrare anu Captain Parke, on seeing Mr. Hajnilton for the first time that he was an undesirable character, and I hear from the Officers of the Royal Air Force that he was unsatisfactory whilst in that Service, It is astounding that he should ever have been selected and I would be glad to hear that it had been brought home to the person responsible how *uc^ much avoidable trouble and embarrassment he has caused to all of us. 6. I saw something of Mr. Lowe during his stay here. He is a shifty young fellow who drinks more than is good for him, and he never ceased abusing the Hedjaz Covernment and the fusaibis while at Bahrain. I could not discover that he had any valid Grievance. It is true that they are housed in huts, but in summer all the Shaikhs in Bahrain move into them, and they are considereu much cooler than houses. It is true that the water supply is slightly brackish, but it almost invariably is on this coast and it is no worse than that drufck daily by all members of the American Mission here. The grievance that pay was in arrears has been disposed of, and unless he is detemined to undergo no hardship whatever, I cannot see what serious grievance he can have, and at the beginning of such an enterprisesome difficulties must be expected. Since Mr. Lowe personally told me that he intended to resign Vresign at the conclusion of his first year, I think resigna tion should be anticipated and that he should oe discharged without more ado# If he remains on in the rorce, I understan that Mr. Nortli, who is of a much better tjp», will resign a and Chief PilotMorris will be left isolated. ?• As regards the mechanics Cairns and Gribble, I think that some communication from the Chief Pilot to his superiors is required before any move can be made, and thougi both men are of a troublesome type, I tkink thai if Mr- Lowe is promptly dealt with it may not be necessary to discharge them at once. They instead leayiDg the Force at the end of the year in any case . 8. The Chief Pilojc also sent me a message to the effect that he thought it would have a very good effect if I were to go to Darin and speak to the malcontents. I am not at all sure that it would, and apart from annoying the Hedjaz Government to whom the usaibis would promptly report my mission, I do not see what I could achieve tuere . Unless I am authorised by you to give them a warning of some kind I should have no locus standi, and as they would certainly bring forward a series of counter complaints against the Hedjaz Grovernment and the Chief Pilot, which I coula do notn ing to set right, no useful purpose would be served. I requ request that I may be given telegraphic orders on this point. 9. I venture to submit the opinion that the bes thing that can be done is to disband the ]?orce as earlj as possible. The Hedjaz Government were encouraged to have British planes and pilots so as to exclude foreigners who might be inimical to our interests, but nothing coula be more damaging to our prestige than these disputes between the personnel of this Force. I fear that with the type oi person supplied and the conditions they have to live under such disputes are likely to increase rather than diminish. 7 /I r The machines are purely military planes, and are of little Talue for for the civilian aviation that is now apparently to be required of this Force, and if they were flown back to Shaiba and their spares returned, the way would be clear for the Kedjaz Government to obtain more suitable machines, and ourselves to be free of a aenace that may at any mpment create a very serious incident. The fact that the hedjaz Government are not replac ing Mr. Hamilton may be an indication that they are contem plating reconstituting the Force with a cheaper staff. 10. Unless early action is taken to stiffen up the discipline of the Hedjaz Air Force, a regrettable incident may occur at any minute. The following incident which has been reported to me by Mr. North whose veracity I have no reason to doubt will show what I mean. Early on the morning on which Mr. Haiailton concluded the drinking bout which led to his discharge, a party including Mr. Lowe, and the mechanics Gairn and Gribble held ( pantomime ) parade, and lowering the Hedjaz flag which had already been foisted, they proceeded to rehoist it with mock ceremonial. 11. To sum up. I recommend that Mr. Lowe's discharjj# should be expedited as far as possible, and also should the Chief Pilot apply for it, that Messrs. Cairn and Gribble should be similarly dealt with. That the Chief Pilot should be armed with ade quate power for preserving discipline. 12. I request that I may be informed whether I should go to Darin and if so what attitude I shoulG adopt there, and finally I request that I may be informed by tele gram as to whether Mr. North should deliver this letter to Qusaibis to be forwarded to the iUnir Faisal. Mr. North will remain at Bahrain till some reply is received regarding Mr. Lowe. , ^ _ I have the honour to be, 3&amp;,' servant lour most Obedient \ Afir I Reference *».

Your Rojal Highne^ss, I have the honour to bring the following facts to jour notice and respectfully request that you will take the action that I haye recommended. If you will refer to my letter No. HAF/25/3/0 dated the 26th March 1930, you will fibd details of a disgrace ful occurrence in which two pilots, Mr. L.S. Hamilton and Mr. C.L. Lowe, were implicated. As a result of this letter, Mr. Hamilton v/as dismissedfrom the Hejaz Air Force, but Mr. Lowe, who was equally inyolYed, was permitted to return to Darin, as it was considerea that his inexperience of tne East, and my unwillingness to ruin his career for what I thought at the time to be more Mr. Hamilton's fault than his, was a suffici ent reason for not taking more drastic steps; moreorer, I imagined that Mr. Hamiltons's dismissal would act as a power ful warning to him and a deterrent, but I was disagreeably surprised to finf that his attitude was one of direct in subordination and that he obriously considered that he h&amp;d been treated in an unfair manner. It has been my intention, since I accepted the post of Chief Pilot to the Hejaz Air Force, to combine strict Royal ty to the Hejaz Government with the endeavour to maintain British prestige in the Hejaz and Nejd. This should not be difficult with the right type of Englishmen to support my efforts, but I regret that it has tocome an impossibility under the present conditions. Unless one is prepared to accept certain hardships as a matter of course, and, above all, to treat the Arab in a manner that is likely to promote good- good feeling between the two races, it is better that such an indiridual is removed from a service where he can do no good, but is likely to ix cause an incalculable amount of harm. Such a man, I regret to say is Mr. Lowe, who, apart from making no effort to learn or respect Arab customs, persists in regarding the Arabs as an inferior race unworthy of his consideration. Such an attitude is impossible and can only lead to grave trouble sooner ot later; he forgets entirely that he is employed by the Hejaz Government and that his first duty is to his employ ers. Moreover, he is actively engaged in fostering discontent among the mechanics, who during his recent absence, have been quietly and happily, but, since his return, have become dis satisfied and unruly. He has constantly disregarded my orders, is completely unreliable and untrustworthy and I do not consi der he posseses that degree of efficiency required to mark him as likely to ever become a successful pilot in this service He does not appear to be temperamentally suited to life in the East and I doubt if he is physically fitted for the work that this Force may be called upon to carry out. His behaviour to Arab gentleman who have shown us kindness and assistance has been rude and boorish and his attitude to me and Mr. North has been that of open hostility. As Mr. North has signified his intention of placing his resignation in my hands if strong action is not immediately taken, I beg to request that Mr. Lowe be at once suspended from duty and removed from Darin. I con sider that his behaviour merits his dismissal from this service and trust Your Royal Highness will again support me in order that the efficiency of this Force may be maintained. As we are doing but little flying at present, I consider that Mr. North and I can carry on until a substitute for Mr. Lowe is sent from England; the marking of the Katif- Jiddah Air Route, details of which scheme have been sutaitted to you, will employ us for some time, after which we can con centrate of re-forming this fBorce and making it fit to carry out the work it may be called upon to perform. In conclusion I wish to assure Your Royal Highne^men^and mj genuine desire to make this Air Force the success it deserves to be - and end that I consider can only be attain ed when it is ridded of the influence that are working against the Government and hampering me at every step 1M1 I take# I have the honout to be f Your Royal Highness f s most humble obedient servant, 9 (sd ) I.M.Morris, Chief Pilot, fiejaz Air Force.

I did best to present alternative ae handsome offer to accept or reject which depended entirely upon King's ideas about flying over etc. Fuad seemed surprised to learn how elaborate were the necessary arrangements for the transport, of one British pilot but thought that King might agree. He asked what kind of machines would compose the squadron. May I be informed of type and capacity ? Point (4) . I was embarrassed by the obvious conflict between pressing for early departure and insisting on emergency landing grounds. Both are delicate matters, as I have tried to avoid the appearance of dictating instructions and I wish to leave the question of emergency landing grounds to mature on lines of which you are aware. Fuad thought progress had been maae with one ground at Jinna Island. Fuad left on 5th August to rejoin His Majesty, whom he will consult.
