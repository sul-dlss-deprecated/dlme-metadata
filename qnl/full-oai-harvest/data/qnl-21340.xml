An estimate is provided for the amount of coin required and it notes that the HC Cruizer
                           Vestalhas been dispatched to Bushire to acquire funds.William Bruce's title in the address of the letter is written as 'Resident at Bussora'. However, it is likely that this is a mistake and that it should read 'Resident at Bushire', as this is how he is typically addressed.Enclosed is a copy of a letter from William Newnham, Secretary to the Government, Bombay to Gideon Colquhoun, in charge of the Residency at Bussora, dated 2 November 1814. The letter instructs Mr Colquhoun to make arrangements with the Resident at Bushire for drawing funds from that treasury.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024052054.0x000006#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
