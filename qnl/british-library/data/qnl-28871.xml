My dear Donaldson, No doubt you saw a copy of Felly’s letter to the Shaikh of Qatar dated 23rd Decemb er^ 1947, No. C/1227, in which he described the boundary line -which H.M.G. had laid down as between Bahrain and Qatar. Mr. Felly communicated this to our Manager at Bahrain who sent it to us, whom it greatly surprised. lie telegraphed to Bahrain on 10th February to the effect that - If now permitted, we comment that we have no objection to principle of Median line based on general configuration of coast lines of the two territories but regret violation of this principle in order to give Hawar Islands and Dibal and Jiradeh shoals to Bahrain to which they do not geographically belong. If it be considered too late to reconsider Hawar allocation there seems all the more reason to allot the two shoals to Qatar.” Since the despatch of that telegram our Geological Department has further studied the question in the light of the interpretation of a number of aerial photographs and our Chief Geologist comments as follows 'From these studies it seems more obvious than before that these shoal areas are a part of the Qatar peninsula. The photographs show depositional reefs which conform to the outline of the north west part of Qatar. These reefs trend from north-south on the west side of Fasht al Dibal to east-west in the northern part of the shoal, then turning to a south east direction on the eastern side of the shoal. In Jiradeh these depositional lines are more or less concentric in shape. In both instances the interpretation of the aerial photographs is that possible geologic structure exists here. This is of course subject to verification by geophysical mebhods, but the possibility of structure is indicated. The position of both these shoals lying to the east of the deep channel between Mahuraq and Qatar strongly indicates further that they are a part of the Qatar structure and probably lie / east- -if-. © ^ 19th March, -J- channel to the west. Thus both from geographic and geologic evidence it appears that the shoals in question are closely related to Qatar and are separated from Mahuraq and Bahrain to the west. On these grounds we consider they should rightfully be allocated to Qatar. The evidence that geologic structure does exist here warrants that a strong effort on our part should be made to have the allocation of the shoals reconsidered.” We appreciate that we are not the Government,and your representatives in the Gulf must, of course, feel that they have good reason for anything they do; but it does seem to us here that a strong case exists for the reconsideration of the boundary line: indeed that both geography and geology cry aloud for such reconsideration. A glance at the map must show the extent to which Bapco was favoured by the allotment of the Hawar Group to its zone: the further allotment to it of the two shoals now under reference is a further blow.

C/1926, dated 23rd December, 1947, deal ing ' 1th the sea which lies between Bahrain and^Qatar, \ 2. we wish to point out that since the time that our ancestors conquered Bahrain from their town of Zubara until the present day the seas lying between, our Eastern coast and the western coast of the Qatar peninsular have been under our control and we have held domination over ■ the islands, shoals and reefs which exist in these waters. Our people own fishing rights, which have never been dis puted, in the waters inside this area. 3. During the lengthy negotiations between our Govern ment and the two oil companies, Bahrain Petroleum Company and Petroleum Concessions Limited who were competing for an oil concession in the seas belonging to Bahrain, in 1938 and 1939, many discussions took place and maps and plans were made showing the sea area which was the subject of the negotiations. These negotiations were carried out through ’s Political Agent who was either present during the meetings or who was provided with a detailed note about all matters which were discussed. The sea area which we were then prepared to lease to the companies between the coasts of Bahrain and Qatar was from and Including the island of Jinan, the most southern island of the Kawar Group, to a point approximately 10 miles north east of Fasht al Dibal. It was at no time suggested by H.B.M. *3 Political Agent that we had no rights over any part of the sea area lying between Bahrain and this line. If our ownership of this area was in doubt why were these negotiations approved by H.a.P.'s poli tical Agent*’ 4. In para 4 of your letter you state that our sovereign rights in Dibal and Jaradeh shoals, which are above spring tide low water level, are recognised. These two shoals are in fact the terminus of one long continuous shoal which begins off ditra Island and reaches Dibal and Jaradeh. There Is no deep water channel crossing this shoal and the highest points , of tills shoal, at Dibal and Jaradah. cannot be separated from the main shoal. We contend that all the sea lying between our coasts up to and including Dibal and Jaradah should be included in the sea over which we have sovereign rights. 3. We are unable to understand why our island of Jinan, which, owing to the rich fishing grounds around it, is an island of value, has been excluded from the Hawar group. Jinan is used as a base by our fishermen who are accustomed, with our permission, to erect huts on the island in the fishing season. Jinan has been recognised as one of tfye islands of the Hawar group and was specifically referred to by us in our letter to *s political Agent, vl g 3 L&gt;JSZ d) of tpr i-j— 1.936 . from our'Adviser to »s Political Agent.

Dear Mr. Harrison, Concerning the proposed boundary line running north-east to south-west, as shewn on the Map you handed to me on the 18th December last, I am to say that my Company is unable to agree to it. My Company regrets having to take up any attitude which may be regarded as at variance with that of H.M.Government, and trusts that the following exposition of the situation as a whole will convince H.M.Government and the Government of Bahrain that its attitude is not only fully justified but that its true interests and claims have not been fully considered. For a proper appreciation of the Bahrain situation it is, of course, to be borne in mind that territorially we are dealing with an Archipelago in a Gulf within the Persian Gulf, the inhabitants of which (the Bahreinis) have carved out an existence as Islanders would do, within and with out the waters of both Gulfs, A careful study of this proposal, in the light of my Com pany^ knowledge of the locality likely to be affected by it, convinces my Company that any such proposal must be one of expediency, but why that should be so and why the area for long regarded by the Company and, indeed, by the Sheikh of Bahrain, as the minimum extent of the Sheikhdom of Bahrain and known indexed‘..'THJ/' ... -2' to your Office as that within the rt Belgrave Line** should be so iSW are questions to which the Coiupany can find no answer* *&amp;lso, Isay should some of these Islands, Islets, Shoals and Shallows which have been made ^ use of by these Islanders, the Subjects of the Sheikhs of Bahrain, and re garded as coming within the Bahrain Archipelago, be treated as enclaves or quasi-enclaves, i.e. as territories wholly or partially surrounded by foreign dominions? This appears to be the case of the Hawar Group of Isles etc. and of Dibal and laradeh to the north of that Group: by no system of reasoning can the Company reconcile the proposal of H.M. Government with the rights and interests both of this Sheikhdom/(which the Company has so sincerely at heart and which it has done so much to protect and improve) and which the Company is so desirous of furthering, and of the Company itself. In fact, the proposed boundary line would hem in the Archipelago from the waters of the Persian Gulf to an extent contrary to established Custom and necessity. Furthermore, by proposing to divide the Sitrah Channel by a line run ning from the open sea to the North Sitrah Light is to do at least four things adversely affecting the interests of this Company, namely:- (1) To hand to a neighbouring Sheikh a right over and under a channel peculiar to the Bahrein Island itself and therefore to the Company and to which that Sheikh could otherwise have no possible claim; (2) To introduce the possibility of serious interference with the Company’s exclusive rights in regard to the production, refining etc. of petroleum and its products within the Sheikhdom of Bahrein; (3) To create a cause for provocation to the Bahrein Islanders which would lead to disturbances inimical to the interests of the Company; and4 (4) To pave the way for rights in third parties granted by a Sheikh either hostile or oblivious to theiInterests of the Sheikh of Bahrain and therefore those claimed by the Company, which must hinder or prevent the Company's operations and bring it into direct conflict with third parties: the Company could not possibly be asked to be put into such a position so directly at variance with the general terms of the Concessions it holds from the Sheikh of Bahrain. This british Company is desirous of reaping the rewards of its pioneer effort in the Bahrain ^chipelago, an effort which has not only opened up a wide horizon of tremendous importance in and to the petroleum world (and in which this Company naturally and fairly stakes its claim) but one also of the greatest importance to the United Kingdom and the Grovernmant of Bahrain. When put to the Company, it was understood that the proposed line was of a political character only, having nothing to do with subsoil rights etc. and accordingly the Company did not recognise that it was par ticularly concerned and was inclined to stand aside because of its policy of steering clear of all politics. However, as the line is now known to be territorial in character and therefore directly affecting the vital interests of the Company, it is very much concerned and views with appre hension a sectional boundary.which (apart from anything else) seems to have been drawn without regard to the petroleum potentialities of the adjoining islets, shoals, shallows and waters generally, particularly those within the 'Belgrave Line* 1 , a boundary hitherto regarded as a feasible minimum line of demarcation of the extent of the Sheikhdom of Bahrain. In this connection my Company believes, although it has not by any means concluded_4_ 1MT n 9. f \y h-sti ' % 1 r/'S., its exploratory work to the eastward and southward of Bahrain, that such a line as has been suggested by H.M.Government might well adversely affect the best interests of the Company and of the Sheikhdom of Bahrain to a very grave extent. Here may I respectfully venture a suggestion;- Why should not H.M.Government take my Company into its confidence by seeking its views and expert advice on the petroleum resources of these surrounding waters and the best method of dealing with them? I say this for the reason that not only has this British Company the best interests of Bahrain at heart but its knowledge of the petroleum resources and possibilities of the surrounding territory is indubitably unequalled although, as yet, incom plete. Besides, might I not pray in aid of my Company’s Case, the addi tional supporting facts (1) Th© Company rescued Bahrain and its many inhabitants from poverty, by venturing in on an operation which no one of the other Companies to whom the original Concession was offered, would seriously consider. In his Mministrative Report dated December 1937, for the years 1926 - 1937, Mr. C. Dalrymple Belgrave (financial 4dviser to the Bahrain Government), says, on page 47 f, If oil had not been discovered rt in Bahrain the Country would now be on the verge of bank rupt ey.” (2) The Company’s productions at Bahrain have been of inestimable value to the War Effort of Great Britain and her .allies, and will be of even greater value to Great Britain in the future. In this latter connection this Company is striving to enlarge the Sterling Area for the production of petroleum crude, to relieve itself of the dollar purchases of crude it is now forced to make. (3) The Company has proved to be worthy of and receives the con fidence of the Bahrain Government, the local Authorities and H.M. Government. ■&lt;\-5- (4) The Company has discovered and serviced the de„ep water channel for navigation into Sitrah, which proved to he of great service not only to the Coijrpany and through it to the Sheikhdom of Bahrain, but'to'H.1!^ Government. (5) Directly and indirectly the Company’s operations provide a great deal of work for local and british labour. (6) In many ways the Company has assisted materially in developing a happy, well-regulated community, with Hospitals, Schools and other modern Social services. (7) The Company has produced a large revenue for the International radio station on Bahrain of Cable and Wireless Ltd. (8) The Company’s financial investment in Bahrain stands at a very high figure which is to be greatly increased in the future by (among other things) the enlargement in size and usefulness of the Refinery which is already extensively used in refining the produce of its own fields and the fields of Saudi Arabia. (9) The Company’s operations wholly within well defined petroliferous areas would obviate the many troubles which are bound to arise where two competing Oil Com panies are developing the same field, a position likely to be aggravated where the base of operations might have to be the same, a base already covered by this Company’s Concession, Bases other than within the Bahrain 4rchipelago are unlikely to be available for efficient and otherwise 11-ordered field and administrative operations in the southern section of the Persian Gulf excepting on the Mainland of Saudi ^Arabia. Lastly, seeing that 1 have been actively engaged in and about the affairs of this Company since its inception, and particularly so wd.th the negotiation of the transfer of the original Concession of 1920 to this Company and of the subsequent Lease of ’’the ^Additional -Area” when practically the whole of the Sheikhdom or Bahrain was entrusted to this Company, so far as petroleum is concerned, I humbly venture the opinionX! - 6 * ; Atit P * S tf** ■ &amp;3P,' that the course outlined above is essentially in the best inter ests of H.M.Government and of the Bahrain Government, I am, F.A.K.Harrison Esq., Commonwealth Relations Office, Downing Street, Whitehall, S.W.l.

I learn that the Company has temporarily withdrawn the Drillers in deference to the objection taken by Mr.Felly. I should explain that the Company was structure drilling in furtherance of its exploratory programme because I had advised that it would be in order so to do. My view was and still is that this is quite outside any general question of boundaries defining the dominions of the Sheikh of Bahrain. You will, no doubt, remember that, following considerable dis cussion and opposition, H.M.Government declared in July 1959 that the Hawar Islands belonged to the Sheikh of Bahrain, This is, I respectfully submit, recorded in the suggestion for the eastern boundary of the Sheikh of Bahrain dominions put forward by H.M.Government to those concerned, including this Company, in December last, so that, in fact, those Islands come within the-2- category of the Islands of tne Bahrain Archipelago in the dominion of the Sheikh of Bahrain, and therefore indubitably tathm the terms of this Comp stay’s Concession. Taking, therefore, the fact that this Company is, by the terms of its Concession held from the Sheikh of Bahrain, bound to proceed with the exploration for oil within the Sheikh’s dominions in accordance with good oilfield practice, it will, 1 think, be admitted that my view on this structure drilling on the Hawar is a correct one to take, and that it is not unreasonable for this Company to ask that its drilling operations on Great Sand Island should be proceeded with. My Company, therefore, asks that it be permitted to con tinue its drilling operations within the Hawar Islands.

Reference paragraph 3 of my Express Letter No.l46-S dated fcxi sucAivS the 16t h J^nuaryje gar ding the division of the sea bed between Bahrain and Qatar. The following are my comments on the Shaikh of Bahrain’s letters Reference paragraph 3 in which it is contended that during the discussions regarding an oil concession for the n additional area” in 1938-39 the political authorities tacitly accepted the red line . shown on the map vide enclosures forwarded under Residency Express Letter No.C-331 dated 7th Ma y 1938, as the Bahrain boundary, this point is dealt with in paragraphs 26, 28(e) and 29(e) of Galloway’s f.Expres s Letter Nq .CZ 14 50 dated the, 31st December 1_946 which formed an enclosure to my letterNo7X26^B~mt^cr^HF~1.8th January 194? and has been accepted there and in paragraph 7 of my letter as one of the arguments for allotting Dibal and Jaradeh to Bahrain. At the time of the negotiations for the “additional area” P.C.L. were inform* ”As your Company understands, there is a possibility that the Shaikh of Qatar might wish to advance claims to certain of the islands, reefs or shaals, and if he should do so such claims would have to be considered by His Majesty's Government with a view to reaching a decision. It should also be clearly understood that any decision subsequently taken with regard to the sovereignty or ownership of any of the islands, reefs or shoals included in the proposed concession areas will only hold good to the'extent that His Majesty's Government are in a position to take and enforce a decision, i.e. as between one protected State and another, and cannot be held to preclude His Majesty’s Government from admitting the sovereignty of any foreign power which may hereafter put forward a claim to the islands, reefs, or shoals if His Majesty's Government in their sole discretion think it expedient to admit that claim.” A proposal was made that a warning on similar lines should be given to the Bahrain Government vide paragraph 3 of India Office telegram No.869 dated 4th May, 1938. . Fowle objected to any suggest ion being made that the claims of a foreign power might be admitted and proposed that a communication should be made to the Shaikh of Bahrain that claims by foreign powers or other Shaikhs to parts of the concessional areas must be considered and decided by His Majesty^ Government on their merits and asked for His Majesty’s Government’s instructions as soon as possible vide paragraph 8 of his Express -Lette r No.C.331 dated 7th May, 1938. Unfortunately so far as my records show no Instructions were received from His Majesty’s Govern ment and no cogimunication was made to the Shaikh. His Majesty’s p.°S' Government's attitude however at the time was clea;r and logical and as no agreement was ever reached between the Bahrain Government and P.C.L. covering the area in the map already referred to and subsequent ly confirmed by a Political Agreement between the Company and His Majesty’s Government. I think we are justified in holding that the mere fact that negotiations were allowed to take place covering the area claimed by the Shaikh of Bahrain did not finally commit His Majesty's Government to a recognition of that claim. The limits of the ’’additional area” are nowhere defined in the concession subse quently granted for it to the Bahrain Petroleum Company 2. With reference to paragraph 4 of the Shaikh’s letter in which it is claimed that Dibal and Jaradeh are the terminus of one long continuous shoal and that the whole of the shoal should there fore be allotted to Bahrain the fact is that Dibal and Jaradeh are intermediate points situated on a salient from a shoal that stretches- o . the whole way from near Sitra Island to Qatar c.f. paragraph 8 of letter No.l26-S of the 18th January ? 1 94Z and the argument used by v a yShaikh might be used for allotting the shoals to Qatar rather than to ' Bahraim. 3. Reference paragraph 5 of the Shaikh's letter regarding Janan Island, if the contention in paragraph 3 of the Shaikh's letter which has been discussed in paragraph 1 above is accepted then Janan n automatically fall to Bahrain. Apart from this the reasons for allotting Janan to Qatar have been fully discussed in paragraph 3 of my letter No.l26-S and in paragraph 14of Galloway's letter No.C/1450 which formed an enclosure to it. It is true that the Bahrain Govern ment included Janan in lists of the Hawar Islands which they submitted in 1936 and 1938 in connection with the negotiations for the additional areas and their omission of it in the list which they submitted in 1938 with specific reference to the dispute over the ownership of the Hawar Islands was perhaps accidental. No mention of the island was made in the correspondence with His Majesty's Government on the owner ship question and the Shaikh was merely informed that His Majesty's Government had decided that the Hawar Islands belonged to the State of Bahrain and not to the State of Qatar. In the Adviser's letter to which a reference is made in the letter communicating His Majesty's Government's decision the islands are described as 'consisting of one large island two or three small islands and a number of. rocky islets' vide enclosures forwarded with Residency Express Letter No.423-S dated 29th April 1939 A At the time the Bahrain Government almost certainly regarded the decision as covering Janan Island but the point was not specifically considered by this Residency or the Political Agency. Our case for allotting it to Qatar must rest on the fact that it wa^hot specifically included in the Hawar group when the decision was made and that we do not consider it to be a part of the group as it is separated from all the other islands by a deep water channel. 4. I do not propose to suggest in more detail the lines on which a reply should be made to the Shaikh until the official reactions of the Bahrain Petroleum Company and the other parties to the case have been received.

From this I infer that Hay is under the impression that both BAPGC and P.D.(Qatar) Ltd. have concessionary rights outside territorial waters as far as the Median Line between Bahrein and Qatar. You will however recollect that Foreign Office and our legal advisers agree as to BAPGO holding such rights, but have expressed doubt whether P.D.

In view of the ambiguity regarding the interpretation of the last contract, I suggest that it may be desirable to explain the position to Hay. I am sending a copy of this letter to Pyrnan. Yours sincerely. Commonwealth Relations Office, Downing Street, London, S.W.I.Extract from page 3 of letter No.26-3 dated 5th January, 1948 from Sir R. Hay to Mr. Donaldson, Is^b yy 10. A decision has been reached regarding the division of the sea bed between Bahrein and Qatar largely with a view to detemining where the Oil Companies sholding concessions in these two Sheikhdoms may be permitted to operate. The boundary line follows a median course between Bahrein Island and the '.atar peninsula but the Hawar Islands excluding Janan and the Oibal and Jaradeh Shoals which lie to the east of the line have been assigned to Bahrein. The decision was announced to the parties concerned on the 24 th December and their reactions are awaited.Please see the paper at Ext. 92/48 and the letters from the Admiralty and the Ministry of Fuel &amp; Power below. The Foreign Office also agree with these views and I suggest a draft letter to Sir R. Hay. 26 . 1 . 2 j- 8 .HRAIT LSTTER Ext. 183/48 Lieutenant-Colonel Sir R. Hay.

No, 1 ?-3 of 3^d January forwarding a copy of a note of a discussion with Russell Brown about the division of the sea-bed between Bahrein and Qatar. 2. We have' noted the sentence 'He feared that although it was definitely stated that the sea-bed only was delimited^and that navigation rights were not affected^ in the course of years the line prescribed might be taken also to delimit the /Zl^. waters and that the Qatar authorities would/object to the Company 1 s ships passing on their side of the buoy.' It cannot be too strongly impressed on those concerned that neither the sovereignty over 'Aos. j the waters abovelnor the rights of free navigation wjtL©s*e uioJkio /are in any way affected. Recognised navigational channels would therefore remain free to shipping proceeding to and from both Bahrein and Qatar on the basis of complete equality.3» As regards Russell Brov/n’s suggestion that it would have been preferable if the dividing line had been taken direct to the Behrein ixght you will no doubt have appreciated that tnis would involve the acquisition by Bahrein of an additional area of sea-bed. I think we should stand firm upon our original decision unless very strong reasons can be shown for departing from it m any respect. If we once start making alterations here and there tne process will be endless.

I would confirm the remarks which were made by Monsell-Davis and myself when we met and point out that, as regards Russell Brown’s proposal that the boundary line should be taken direct to Bahrein Light Vessel, I would remark that thereby Bahrein would acquire an additional area of sea bed. There would be no objection to this if Qatar were compensated in some way, as for example by alloting Qatar the Dibal and Jaradeh shoals. However, you will recollect that these shoals were allotted to Bahrein because 'as far as is possible to assent a claim to sovereignty by allocation of cairns etc., such steps have been taken by the Bahrein Government and not be Qatar'. . With regard to navigation rights, there appears to be some confusion, since ownership of the sea bed does not in ary way carry the right to interfere with shipping. Since both Bahrein and Qatar are under British protection I think that the Bahrein Petroleum Company may be assured that recognised navigational channels in this area remain free to shipping proceeding to and from both Bahrein and Qatar on a basis of complete equality.

Attested for Secretary to the Political Resident, in the Persian Gulf.Vi Translation of letter dased the 12th Rabi IX, 1367 (21.2.’48), from His Excellency the Ruler of Qatar, to the political Agent, Bahrain, After c omp 1 iments, It pleases me to refer to Your Excellency's es teemed -1 efcers Io s. C/1287 and 0/160 da ted the 23rd December, 1947, and the 4th February* 1948, respectively, regarding the delimitation of the sea bed -which Your- Excellency referred to as being shown on the map forwarded with Your Excellency's letter of the 23rd December, 1947.

However, I like to invite your Excellency’s attention to the correspondence exchanged some ten years ago on the subject of Huv;ar (Island) and the clear reprosentaticjem T made regarding its position ir my letter submitted to His Excellency the’political Agent, Bahrain, at the time, in which I expounded ray points of view in regard to this Island which is a part of Qatar and in which I expressed my protest against the behaviours of Bahrain Government. But H.M*'s Goverrimert acted as they wished, and I had nothing but to submit, reserving ir the meantime to myself my own rights. The map you were kind enough to send me shows clearly that Deebil shoal and Huvar Islands are within the territory of Qatar. Huwar is directly attached to the coast of Qatar with a piece of shallow water dis connecting. which recedes at ebb tide, thus establish ing access for pedestrians. If this is its natural position and geographical aspect, how can it be separated from its motherland Qatar and made the domain of o-her than its ruler? Xefc as I have mentioned to Your Excel lency I carrot but exercise patience, being content with what Your Excellency said that this decision is liable to alteration at any time ir case more exact geographical data are forthcoming. 1 This strengthens in me the hope that H.M.'s Government will reconsider the matter once again and award a more correct decision based on geographical data etc. NS.

He suggested that it would have been preferable if the line had been taken direct to the Bahrain Li b ht Vessel. He geared that although it was definitely stated that the sea bed only was delimited, and that navigation rights were not affected, in the course of years the line prescribed might be taken also to delimit the waters and that the Qatar authorities would then object to the Company's ships passing on their side of the buoy. I gathered from him that a similar question is likely to arise when the northern boundary of the Bahrain sea bed is delimited as Aramco are most anxious to retain exclusive rights over their main navigation channel in this area. Hr. Bussell Brown stated that he was giving me his personal views only and that he did not known whether his head office would have any other objections to raise. He added that from the general point of view he thought it was a mistake to allot the Bibal an&lt;f Jaradeh shoals to Bahrain and that it would have simplified matters if nothing had been allotted to Bahrain east of the boundary line in this area. ltd/- b.R.

WITH THE GOIvIPLIlviENTS OP MR. W.D. MONSELL DAVIS \ Petroleum Division^ Ministry of Fuel and Power, 7, Millbank, S.L.1.Dear Pjrsan, I write with reference to Harris on 1 s letter (Bart. 2718/^7) of the 4th Dece her enclosirig a draft reply to Hay’s telegrams itQBm 1241 and 1246. In paragraph 2 of telegram Ho. 1241 the Political Ilesident proposed, in mking the announcement, w© sixould say that in the demarcated areas H.M.G, are willii^g to permit the respective oil coapanies to operate. He is inclined to recounend that no mention should be made of the question of sovereignty specifically, except in respect of Hawar Island and Dibal and Jara- dab. shoals, ZWAQ -Use . ,\ \Q {. „; C) In the draft reply Harrison proposes to agree that the eas -imication should in the first instance be limited to stating that the line demarcates areas in which H. .&amp;• are willing to per lit the two oil coGpanies to*operate. Moreover, he states that.later we shall no doubt have to amplify this. In this connection I would remark that it would be a unique precedent to permit an oil company to start operations in an area where the sovereignty of the sub-soil petroleum rights is undefined. It would seem to me to be in the interests of both rulers and companies that this qiiestion should be settled before exploration is begun and in articular before any exploration drilling is undertaken which might lead to the discovery /of L.F.L. Pyman, Esq., Foreign Office, Downing Street, London, S»W.1«( 2 ) of oil in ccsaiercial quantities. If the question of the sovereignty is left unsettled and if under these circumstances oil should be discovered, it is possible to envisage complications ¥/hich might arise resulting from rital del is to the subsea petroleum rights. It T-ould seem to me that the rulers concerned would not appear to t bound by ai^r definition of the areas of operations which hi.* been proinised for the two- oil canpanies coaicerned. I would therefore suggest that the original announcement should include, provisions for the sovereignty to cover the sea bed in the areas demarcated. * r ' I a sending a copy of this letter to Harrison at the Ocmionwealth delations and Dodds at the Admiralty. v ■ « * *. • ’ 3*X ')■ ■ Tours sincerely.

Although the minutes do not specifically say so, we think that they imply that we ought uo notify -khe State Be tj art me nt of any solution of this problem on which we decide shortly before informing the Rulers concerned of our decision. ^ 2 . fhe question has now been considered in the light of the reports and recommendations of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. The attached diagram, of which we end os two copies, illustrates both the problem and our solution to it, B. Before explaining our solution of the problem we should explain that sovereignty over the Hawar Islands (which «re inhabited) has, in the past, been in dispute between Bahrein and ^atar, and that in 1939 His Ma t jesty , s Government yfter carefully weighing the rival claims, announced a decision in favour of Bahrein in view of this State’s historical claims and despite the geographical propinquitv of the group to Tatar♦ The actual extent of the group (i.e. the number of islets, reefs, etc., which it includes) have not hitherto been accurately defined. North of the Hawar Islands you will see two shoals named Rasht ai Dibal and Katat al Jaradeh. Bibal consists of a coral reef which is com, letely submerged at high water except for a cairn and a wall built bv the Bahrein Government a few years ago. Jaradeh is a sand bank, a small portion of which remains above high water at high tide. The shoals are thus, apparently, not capable of habitation and so far as it is possible to assert a claim to sovereignty by erection of cairns etc., such steps have been taken by the Bahrein Government but not by Tatar. No pronouncement regarding sovereignty has yet been made by His Majesty’s Government. Ror your own information we* should perhaps include a reference here to the two oil companies interested in this question. On the Bahrein side there is the Bahrein Petroleum Gompany; a company under the same American ownership as the Arabian American Oil Company in baudi Arabia, but actually registered as a British company in Canada* on the Tatar side we have Petroleum Development (uatar) Ltd., a subsidiary of the Irak Petroleum Company of which 23 . 75 m of the shares are held by the Near East Development Corporation (representing a group of United btates oil companies;. The Bahrein Petroleum Company have already been granted permission to drill for oil on the main Hawar * Island, and have applied for permission to drill on one of the outlying sand banks of the Hawar group and two points to the oouth Bast of the Bibal and Jaradeh shoals. It appears that the latter two points will probably fall to Qatar under our proposed award.

In cases such as this it is considered that the Median bine should not be diverted, but that the islands should be &amp; iven their sh&amp;x*e of territorial waters on the usual principles. These territorial waters are delimited on the attached map by the broken line a B 0 i) b f G li I J £ b, This line v.-ould however leave a narrow tongue of uatar waters formed by points I u X, and for obvious reasons of practical convenience it is ^proposed, provided the parties concerned a u ree, to smooth this - out by altering the line M I b to U f 4, thus exchanging area f I G for the e^ual area 0 J 4 . The final dividing the line between Bahrein and v atax j waters would therefore run from wahrein biglat Vessel via b a B j B u y G u p m. 6. Again, north of the haw ar Islaixis and on the .atar side of the Median wine are the two shoals Bibal and Jaraueh, whose status we have explained in paragraph 3 above. It is considered that since the Bhailch of Bahrein has taken steps usually regarded ae sufficient for an assertion of sovereignty (in this case the erection of cairns) these shoals must be allotted to him. however, as the shoals are not capable of continuous human habitation, being wholly or partly submerged at hi^h water, *»e consider that they can claim no territorial waters. we think, therefore, that Bahrein sovereignty over them should extend only to the areas which arc above the Spring- Tide low v-ater level. -o have already mentioned th-t we ho not consider that the existence of such shoals justifies the diversion of the Median Lino. 7. The Political Mesideat will shortly cowaau Icate tils decision to the Rulers concerned -s soon ae the atate oepartuient have been notified. he will allow a ehert period for the r&amp;i$l:4g of oh Sections, fester which the dec is ion will becowiC final.

Their conclusions are embodied in the attached diagram,,, of which copies are enclosed herewith, icie principles which have,been followed in drawing this diagram are as follows:- i a /' Tne Median I^ine is based .generally on the main configuration of the coastlines. This is in accordance with the doctrine of the Truman Declaration that .in cases where the Continental Shelf extends from the shores of one State to those of another State, or is shared between adjacent States, tne boundary shall be determined ’’in accordance with equitable principles'• « Minor reefs and shelves on the sea—bed ° f A should not affect the drawing/the Median tine. tsLo^fs (k) gioal and Jaradeh Skolvrrs . Since the Sheikh of Bahrein ^ Suffice y has oaxen^^pe steps usually regarded as Hoccgsary for an 0, $ A v. assertion of sovereignty, it is considered that these Sholvoc must be allowed to him. It is not considered, however, that itu-y should nave territorial waters and Bahrein*sovereignty over them will tnus extend only to the areas which are above tne £prin^ /icie low-water level. t copy of a minute by assistant Legal Adviser, Foreign Office, showing the legal grounds on which this view is based is attached .3 . il.k.ir. 0.0 not consider that there would be justification for devia oing the Meaian $ine to include Dibal and Jaradeh on the 'Bahrein side. liawar Islands . The line delimiting this group oft islands is drawn on the principle of giving the group their share of territorial waters on the usual principles. This is easier tt|' justify, !justify than your own proposal that the line should follow the low-water level on the eastern side. i^j l he points on the line as amended should be defined as follows:- Position True Nautical Bearing Miles Prom No .9 Bu Sa' ada I e N. point of Rabadh I.

There would be an advantage on practical grounds in smoothing this out, and it is suggested ^ that this might be effected by altering the line H I J to H PQ, thus exchanging an equal area P I 0 for 0 J Q, provided that the parties concerned agree. „ 3* In any pronouncement or agreement it will be desirable that the assigned positions of (a) the North Sitra Light Buoy and (b) the Bahrein Light Vessel should be further defined by bearing and distance as follows:- (a) 06 I 2 true 15.20 Nautical Miles, and (k) 0 4og° true 2o.05 Nautical Miles from the Political Agent's flagstaff Latitude 26 14*1^ N, Longitude 50 u (approximately), as the positions ot x 1oating marks are subject to frequent alteration.

As regards possible modifications to the line round the IBsrar Islands, we prefer the solution set out in paragraph 2a of Dodds 1 letter. So far as Dibal and Jaradeh are concerned, we stand by our opinion that they cannot be considered, to have territorial waters. It will be appreciated that there are many rights and incidents attached to territorial waters irrespective of the right to exploit the sea-bed beneath them. With regard to the query which Dodds raises, we have not in fact maintained that habitability is a criterion of sovereignty. In fact, in my letter to you of the 28th July, we agreed that the Sheikh of Bahrein should be recognised to have sovereignty over Dibal and Jaradeh. what we did say was that a rock or shoal not capable of human use and. habitation in its present state should not be regarded as having territorial waters. As regards paragraph 4 of your letter of the 28th August, we agree that we should not be justified in deviating the median line in order to include Dibal and Jaradeh on the Bahrein side. If the department^concerned are prepared to agree on the above point we suggest' that you should now. send send the necessary information to the Political Resident.

I hope that one of these alternatives will be considered suitable# 3# So far as the waters around Dibal and Jaradah are concerned, we feel that it is a pity that they cannot have their own territorial waters in view of Monsell Davis* s remarks about the likelihood of oil there. This is a point on which we must accept the views of the Foreign Office but on the face of it, it would seem -that if it is possible to claim and maintain sovereignty over the sea-bed, it ought to be possible to claim it and maintain it over island - whether covered at high tide or not. If habitability is the criterion of sovereignty it is difficult to see how sovereignty can be effectively claimed over the sea-bed; this is precisely what President Truman*s proclamation purports to do. 4» I an sending copies of this letter to Monsell Davis and Garran, Yours sincerely.

There is one point of which I am a little doubtful, and that is the accuracy of the map used by the Admiralty, This appears to be based on the Political Resident's drawings and is probably not entirely accurate. However, I think it is good enough to put to the Rulers provided a reservation about its accuracy is made. Sir R. Hay suggested that the waters should be surveyed by the Challenger, but the Admiralty say that this cannot be done at present. In his letter of the 10th June, Sir R. Hay suggested that an air survey might be made. I doubt whether it is really worthwhile H.K.G. going to this trouble themselves, but Z beli-ev» P.C.L. have been making an air survey of the region and may very likely produce their photographs if they think our map is not accurate and does not do them justice. 27 . 8 . 47 .Ext .1770/47 I.P.

We therefore accept the proposition set out in paragraph 2(a) of Dodds’ letter No. M 884/47 of the 19th May. We regard the proposition in paragraph 2 (b) of the Admiralty letter, however, as somewhat too rigid and it seems to us that the practical inconvenience of having narrow tongues of Qatar waters between the Hawar Islands and Bahrein makes the Admiralty proposals in this respect inequitable. We are' accordingly still of the opinion that the better^solution is to deviate the median line in such a way that no such tongues exist. Possibly Qat#r^ could be compensated elsewhere along the boundary for this small loss, fhe Hawar enclave is after all very close to the median line and the main Hawar Island is of considerable size. In general we feel that it is unwise at this stage to lay down hard and / fast S.P. Donaldson, Esq., G.M.G., India Office.mmm fast rules for determining such boundaries, and far better to insist on the salutory latitude of the word n equitable” in President Truman’s doctrine* However, we would not wish to insist on this solution if everyone else is satisfied with the Admiralty proposals. Turning to the question of Dibal and Jaradeh, we agree that since the Sheikh of Bahrein has taken the steps usually regarded as necessary for an assertion of sovereignty they must be alloted to him. ¥/e do not consider that they should have territorial waters, and Bahrein’s sovereignty over them will extend only to the areas which are above the spring tide low-water level, I enclose extract from a minute by our Assistant Legal Adviser, showing the legal grounds upon which we base this view* Supposing this view to be generally accepted, we are left with the problem of the waters between Dibal and Jaradeh and Bahrein. If these areas are small and the proposed strip of Qatar water between them and Bahrein is comparatively wide, we should not wish to oppose the Admiralty suggestion in respect of them. It would perhaps be wise to reserve final judgement on this point and also of the question of Hawar waters, including the problem of the division of the waters between Hawar and the Qatar mainland, until we have seen a map with the boundary line marked on it. We therefore feel that the next step would be for the Admiralty to produce a map with the proposed boundary /lineline marked on it. We therefore feel that the next step would be for the Admiralty to produce a ^ map with the proposed boundary line marked on it. and for a meeting then to be held to reach a final decision. There remains the question how the decision which we finally reach is to be put to the parties concerned. We note that the Political Residents proposed announcement makes no mention of President Truman’s continental shelf doctrine, ihis is probably wise but I think that we shall have to be prepared to quote this doctrine in support of our decision if the State Department, or the Bahrein Petroleum Company complain about our decision. It looks as if points S and P at which the Bahrein Petroleum Company wish to drill will be alotted to Qatar. An American protest is therefore by no means unlikely. As regards Sir Rupert Hay’s suggestion that this announcement might be made in he first place in tentative form and six months allowed for the raising of objections, we are prepared to be guided by his advice. I return your maps with thanks.-Gop-y (E 1462/716/91) J ir~ J 1 HI In connection with the Hague Codification Conference 1930 very many divergent opinions were expressed on the question of what may constitute an island and have territorial waters* Article 5 of the Draft Convention drawn up by M. Schucking, Rapporteur of the Committee of Experts for the Progressive Codification of International Law, implies that any part of the sea bed not continuously submerged is an island and has territorial waters. In our reply to the Questionnaire issued by the Preparatory Committee of the Conference, expressed the view that M An island is a piece of territory surrounded by water and in normal circumstances permanently above high water* It does not include a piece of territory not capable of effective occupation and use. H.M.G. considers that there is no ground for claiming that a belt of territorial waters exists round rocks and banks not constituting islands as defined above, and would view with favour an international agreement to this effect in order that there may be no doubt as to the status of the waters round such rocks and banks and round artificial structures raised upon them* n Other members of the British Commonwealth of Rations expressed views substantially similar to that of Great Britain, but the majority of the other states in their replies to the questionnaire were inclined to the opinion that any naturally formed part of the earth’s surface projecting above the level of the sea at low tide should be considered an island and have territorial waters. On the Replies, the Preparatory Committee made the following observations: ’•Two main conceptions appear in the above replies. According to one, an island must be above water at high tide. According to the other, it is sufficient for it to be above water at low tide. A compromise may be contemplated. It will consist in allowing an island (i.e., an isolated island) to have its own territorial waters only if it is above water at high tide, but in taking islands which are above low-water mark into account when determining the base line for the territorial waters of another island or the mainland, if such islands be within those waters .* 1 The Committee also drew up the foliov/ing 'Basis for discussion' for the Conference: 'In order that an Island may have its own territorial waters, it is necessary that it should be permanently above the level of high tide. In order that an island lying within the territorial waters of another island or of the mainland may be taken into account in determining the belt of such territorial waters, it is sufficient for the island to be above water at low tide.' In his memorandum of 21 June, 1937, (printed paper N.3151/29/30) on the Conference, Mr. Pitzmaurice draws the /followingfollowing general conclusions from the discussions on this question: '(a) That an island proper and having its own territorial waters, must be permanently uncovered at high tide and be capable of use and occupation. It need not, perhaps, be entirely natural, provided it is not a mere floating work and rests on the sea-bed. (b) On the other hand, near the mainland, i.e., within the territorial belt, and for the purpose of establishing a base-line along the mainland, an 'island** may consist of a mere rock or bank if uncovered at low water .’ 1 It would I think be consistent with our practice in the past and with the views which we have expressed on the international law on the matter and with the conclusions to which, judging from Mr. Pitzmaurice*s analysis, the discussions of the Conference were leading^ to consider a shoal of rock outside the territorial belt as an island having territorial waters only if it is (a) uncovered at high tide and (b) capable of use and occupation, meaning that it must be at least capable of human use and habitation in its present state. There is no contrary pronouncement on the legal position by any authority which we ought to follow, and I am, therefore, of the opinion that these tests should be applied by us in the case of Dibal and Jaradah. We are informed thatt- (a) Dibal consists of a coral reef which is completely submerged at high water except for a cairn built by the Bahrein Government and a small square of wall built to protect the head of an artesian well, sunk by the oil company which holds the oil concession over Bahrein. The wall is damaged and out of action. (b) Jaradah is a sand bank of which an area of about twenty yards by ten yards is permanently above water. It also has a cairn erected by the Bahrein Government and an artesian well, the history of which is not stated. The base of the cairn and the well which is sealed are both below high water level. My conclusion, therefore, is that Dibal and Jaradah could not on the evidence be said to be capable of human use and habitation in their present state and they should not be considered to be islands having territorial waters.. By the courtesy of P.C.L. on the 18th June I was flo'Mi over most of the Qatar peninsula. I was shown Hamlah where a temporary port is to be constructed and flew south to somewhere in the vicinity of Jebel Haksh which I could not identify from the air. I was also shown the site of the proposed port at Umm Said on the eastern shoie of the peninsula. In this area there are a number of high sand dunes and the Company’s terminal is to be at the most northerly point where tne sand dunes come down to the sea shore. This point is about a mile south of the southern base of the promontory marked Jezirat Mishi- riyat on the Western Sheet of the Persian Gulf cnart and a long way north of the boundary claimed by Ibn Saud . The most southerly point where the Company are operating at present is on the west coast of the peninsula about 25 miles north of Jebel ITaksh. Next year they hope to carry out survey operations right up to the southern frontier. The Company are not operating at all at present in the Jebel Nakiyan. 3d.

Ext 1223/47* 6 JU „ 1947 , * urnfo You will have seen Dodd5s letter ^of the 19th May giving the Admiralty vievys about the division of the waters between Bahtin and Qatar. 2. The Admiralty view differs fromthe conclusions tentatively arrived at at the meeting in Beckett's / room on 31st March in that it does not favour the deviation of the n^Lddle line between, the two 39l£ Q lines to include enclave groups of isletf The effect of this on the Bahrain/Qatar problem is that the Dibal and Jaradeh Shoals (with or without territorial waters) will be left as Bahrain enclaves on the Qatar sicfe of the main dividing line and that there will be a small amount of sea bed belonging to Qatar left on the west side of these shoals. In the south, however, the line suggested by the Admiralty to define the limits of Hawar territorial waters will be partly contiguous with the main dividing line between Bahrain and Qatar. As regards the delimitation of the Hawar . . . .. ... ... r , f , n f. , . \ group itself, the Admiralty line, as I understand it, is drawn on the principle of giving the Hawar group their full share of territorial waters on usual principles, whereas the Political Resident's line on the eastern side of the group followed the line of law water level. 3. Generally speaking it appears to us that the Admiralty5suggested delimitation is the easiest way to justify to the Oil Companies and Rulers concerned ^ since if the principles on which it is based are once accepted there is little room for argument how the line should be drawn. There is, however, one question/which needs further consideration from the legal point of view, namely, whether reefs which may/wmamam . may be partly or heavily submerged at high tide, such as Dibal and Jar^jleh should have territorial waters. This is clearly a point of some importance with reference to the general continental shelf question, and the present decision may form a precedent. On the face of it it appears rather absurd that a state which, by the erection of a cairn ^establishes the claim to a rock in the sea, should thereby acquire jurisdiction over the sea bed within radius of three nautical miles. Is it possible under international law to apply the condition that in order to have territorial waterman island must be capable of continuous habitation. 4. Once we are all agreed how the lines should be drawn the next question will be how the decision is to be put before the auihoriti-eo concerned. In paragraph 12 of his letter of the 18th January, the Local Resident made the following recomaendation:- 'I would suggest therefore that an announcement should be made that pending a proper survey of the waters concerned, i f* if’Ifo In-tUi* 0 w i 0 ?] the line described/as the boundary so far as the sea bed is concerned between Bahrain and Qatar and that to the east of this line recognise^ the sovereignty of Bahrain over the Hawar Island^ (excluding Jacadeh) and the Dibal and Jarjideh shelves down the spring-'tide low water level only. In the case of the Hawar islands^the sea-bed between them inside a line drawn round the out^nost islands at low water level will also be recognised as belonging to Bahrain and the same principle will apply to the sea-bed between the Dibal and Jar^deh elves. ” / The Local Resident add^i that the announcement might in the first place be made in tentative . i form six months allowed for the raising of objections. So far as the\^Iawar islands ^^oonoemed, ^ the Admiralty view is accepted,^ the^fonaula proposed by the Political Resident will need alt edition. The descript ion given in paragraph i \ 4 of Dodd$# let ter of 19th'May might perhaps be used \ if the ft, fb+Mu+l'itvUvfc Admiralty are satisfied thal\the chart on which the im^asm&amp;^were b&amp;sed/'''N, based is accurate. We shall be glad to have t£e observations of the Admiralty on this poialC If existing charts cannot be guaranteed and it is impossible for the Challengers to undertake to ^drvey in the near future, it is difficult to see how we can produce an authoritative map for the guidance of the parties concerned. An alternative to, giving a verbal description of the dividing lines in the first place would be to produce a map with the lines marked. This would perhaps be a preferable procedure if the Admiralty could undertake to produce copies of the required maps. “''N, /&gt; ft) &gt;TELEPHONE! HOLBORN 8434. The Bahrein Petroleum Cc— 1 Cliffords Inn, London, E.C.4. ■o 2nd June 1947.. ' Dear Mr. Harrison, I have this morning received a cable from the General Manager of this Company at Bahrein, to the effect that he had on the 1st June been verbally infomed by the Political Resident that H.M.Government had approved the Comp'any’s request, (a) to locate drilling holes at any convenient place within 440 yards seaward of the high tide mark on the Kawar Island, providing such location is not at any one of the many small islands or sandbanks adja cent to the main Hawar Island, and (b^ that this 440 yd. limit will not in any manner influence the location of the authoritatively defined boundary of 'Hawar” which is being considered by H.M.Government. The General Manager adds that he expects to resume operations in the course of a few days on re ceipt of the letter from the Political Agent. Thank you for dealing with this matter. I gather from the cable I cite that the Company had not commenced operations on Hawar Island itself close to high tide mark, or if they had done so, they had ceased immediately upon receipt of my letter to them of 21st May pointing out that it was not in order for them to proceed until the matter had been dealt with by H.M.Govern ment in London. May I add that I have to-day received a letter from mt.H.B. Hichols, Vice President of the Company, to the effect that they had learned with some concern of the proposed operations at Haw r ar prior to the receipt cf formal approval from London, and they had cabled on the 27th May to Mr.Russell Brown pointing out that he was not authorised to drill elsewhere than points G, H. and I above high tide mark and that he 'should suspend' operations until and unless formal specific written approval was received.

Ext^^sion 808. fclC.7£T My dear Harrison, I regret the delay in replying to’your'Te“t't' 0 i ri No. Ext. 26l/47 of the 15th February concerning the division of the waters between Bahrein and Qatar. I am sure however you will realise that this is a novel and complicated subject. 2. The Board considers that the answers to the questions in paragraph 12 of your letter are as follows:~ (a) The median line should be based on the main configuration of the coastlines since we are dealing here with the logical extension of the continent and minor reefs and shelves on the sea bed’ have no bearing on the main principle. (to) This principle is not affected toy the existence of enclave groups of unimportant islets since it is still a question of finding a median line between the main coastlines and the fact that the power owning the land on the opposite side has established a valid claim to an islet near the other coast is not relevant. (c) Each group of small islets should have its own territorial waters assessed on the usual principles. A group of islets clearly cannot have a continental shelf of its own, but equally the power owning the islet must have jurisdication over the maritime belt surrounding them. (d) The question of the drying patches off the south east coast of Bahrein is really a matter for you and the Foreign Office. If sovereignty is not claimed over these - and in view of the median line proposed on the drawings which you sent us it would appear that it is not - they must be discounted. Otherwise it is only necessary to say that if sovereignty is effectively claimed over such banks they should be treated as in (c) above. 5. In any agreement on this subject we feel that the assigned positions of (a) the North Bitra Light Buoy and (b) the Bahrein Light Vessel should be further defined by bearing and distance, (a) 06l-g-° true 15.20 nautical miles, and (b) 0464 ° true 28.05 nautical miles from the Political Agent's Flagstaff, Latitude 26° 14 '.1 N, longitude 50° 55'.2 E (approx), as the positions of floating marks are subject to frequent alteration. The other points on the green pecked line should be similarly defined as K 104° true 9.53 nautical miles and M 180° true 18.03 nautical miles, from the triangulation Station No. 102 on Has al Barr. v ■' yg:'. /4 . .....

With regard to paragraph 13 of your letter, H.M.S. u GIiALLEl'GBR ,, already has a full programme of important strategics-navigational surveys which will take several years to carry out. To survey adequately the area discussed in this letter would take the best part of a season and the Board feel that 'CHALLENGER' should not he diverted for this purpose, which is after all as yet somewhat academic and could not compare with the work on which the ship is already engaged. - 7 .

The Company will endeavour to drill as close in shore as the draft of the drilling barge will permit. It is understood that the 440 yard limit requested will not in any manner influence the location of the authoritively defined boundary of Hawar which I understand His Majesty's Government now have under consideration.' The Political Agent considers, and I agree, that the quarter mile limit with the attached proviso is acceptable and, if His Majesty's Government see no objection, I should be grateful for confirmation by telegram that I may inform the Company accordingly. 3.

Bahrain Petroleum Company have been informed of substance of telegram copy of which was received with your endorsement quoted. They now request 'reconsider ation of the proviso that all (structure) drilling shall be above high tide mark on Hawar Island', and suggest 'some latitude in this connection be permitted while observing the intent of the proviso in principle'. 3. Reason given for this request is that drilling will be done by equipment mounted on a. barge floated on to beach at high tide. After completion of one structure hole it is refloated and moved to another location. BAPCO explain that saving in equipment and personnel can be made by using this method, but structure holes will be slightly below high water mark. 4. It would seem to me to meet case if I were authorised to inform BAPCO that their drilling should be as near high water mark as possible, and, of course, in no case below low water mark. 5. BAPCO also ask me to enquire from the Adviser to the Bahrain Government as to whether there is any res triction on the number and location of the structure holes which they may drill in the areas permitted by us. Presume there is no such restriction and I may write to the Adviser accordingly. = POLITICAL = Copied. G.A.M./ :gkam (o. t, r sECSEt. EXT - &lt;r . -*“'n Telegram S.

As regards (a), we see no objection to the course proposed m your second paragraph with which, I note, the Foreign Office are in agreement. We agree that it would be desirable at this stage to include the reservations about not drilling beyond high water mark of the main island or at point M J' in the BAPGO programme. ; ? 3 „ As regards (b), we, from our point of viewy would welcome any arrangement which gives P.C. L. the opportunity of accumulating information about the oil prospects of the Qatar Peninsula - by aerial surveys or otherwise - and any examination they are able to make of areas in the vicinity of the Qatar mainland may, of course, be helpful to their future programme of developnent. In equity, we also feel that we should normally give P.C.L. the benelit of the doubt in this connection, since, as you say, BAPCO have, in fact, scouted around a good deal, whereas P.C.L., through circumstances beyond their control, have, as yet, been unable to examine more than a limited section of the Qatar Peninsula and its environs. Subject to the Foreign Office views we would, /therefore.- 2 - I therefore, favour allowing P.C#L. to include these two ^^als in their aerial survey. I am sending a copy of this letter to Gault.

We might however at the same time make it clear that they should not extend these drillings beyond high water mark on the island and explain that we make this proviso and do not wish them to drill at point W J* because the precise extent of the Hawar Islands, apart from the main island, is under consideration by H.M.G* at the moment with a view to their being authoritatively defined, 3* I gather from Gault that the Foreign Office are in agreement with this course and should be glad to know whether /you &amp;• L« citock, Ssq*, Ministry of Fuel &amp; Power Mill bank.you would now be prepared to concur so far as the Ministry - , of Fuel and power consider the*&amp;selves to be concerned in wik/f is primarily a political question* 4* I also enclose a copy of a telegram from the Political Resident asking whether there is any No. 279 dated 4th March ) objection to PCL now being allowed to carry out a topographical air survey of the Dibal and Jaradeh shoals.

The ’plane is now in Qatar and P.C.L. wish to start work immediately. 3. The programme of operations can be divided roughly into three main categories: (a) Air-survey of the Qatar main-land as far south as the red-line, vide enclosure to Residency Express Letter No.1017-C dated the 16th November, 1946. * - — ^ ... (b) Qatar territorial waters,- and (c) the area bounded on the west by the red-line marked on chart Asia, Persian Gulf, vid© my Express Letter No.c/1450 &lt;2t&gt;/ of the 31st December,, 1946. ~ 4. So as not to delay work and cause unnecessary expense to P.C.L. as regards (a) I stated that I had no objection to the starting of the work. As regards (fc) I stated that I had no objection to the work being carried out over Qatar territorial waters to the east of the peninsula. As regards (c) I stated that I was unable to give permission myself, and that I would refer the matter and endeavour to give a reply within a few days to avoid closing down the survey. 5. (c) can be sub-divided in four sub-heads. * (i) Hawar. (ii) The Hawar Group as enumerated, vide my '’xpress hotter f[o r f/.i4^n ^^ ’ tiie 31st December. 194Q. (ili) Deebal and Jaradeh features.

It is not feasible to permit both companies to operate because they are rivals in this region ana particularly so at Jarmbiyeh. k possibility of the exchange of information exists, but I neither recommend it nor think it practicable. I, therefore, suggest that P.C.L. should be requested to postpone the air-survey. ^ / ftr'VW* frlci (iii) As regards Deebal and Jaradeh the ownership of these features is also sub judlce though there is a possibility that Bahrain * s claim will not be substantiated. It further differs in that BAPCO have already carried out certain operations on the features. None of this inclines me to the view that P.C.L. should now be allowed to operate which would be in competition with BAPCO. My opinion is that until a decision has been reached by His Majesty’s Government the features (as delimited in my &amp;(*( E xpress Letter MQ.C/1450) should be considered closed to operations wHetEer aerial or surface. (iv) With the exception of areas covered by (i), (ii) and (ill) I see no objection to the proposed air- survey. 6. I should be grateful for very early instructions. ArfB-BTKD . Sd./- A.C.

I enclose a copy of a letter received from petroleum Concessions Limited. 2. to My comments are (x) that there is no objection the shaikh of Qatar being informed of (b), (c) and (d). (y) As regards (e) it seems to me that this information should not b© conveyed yet to the Shaikh since it is dependent on (a). (z) As regards (a) my estimation of the situation in that area ofthe frontier is that the Saudi Arabian Government consider that Kikyan al Katar belongs to uat&amp;r and that south of that point is Saudi Arabian territory. This means that they claim the Khor Odaid and a few miles of the coast to the north. His Majesty’s Government, however, maintain that the north shore of the Khor Odaid is the north-western extremity of Abu Dhabi territory and that northwards is Qatar territory. 3* Al Arrif is said to be situated some 16 miles north of the Khor Odaid and raay, therefore, lie in disputed territory? it certainly must be close to it. The site is of the greatest importance to Petroleum Concessions Limited, and before I can give a definite opinion whether or not it is in disputed territory, I must know its exact situation. I, therefore, request that H.M.S. 'Challenger** may be asked telegraphically to inform me of the map co-ordinates urgently. In the meanwhile I should be grateful for con- firmation that (b), (c), and (d) may be conveyed to the * Shaikh of Qatar. ATTESTED. Sd*/- A.C.

NS.\ i ■* Copy of letter No. QSA.2/4668 dated the 30th ^ember, 1946, from Messrs, petroleum Concessions Limited, i^fSilrain, to the political Agent, Bahrain, Many thanks for your D.O* December, 1946. No.C/1409 dated the 20th of 1* Since writing our QSA.2/4698, we have had a telegram from London informing us that the undermentioned propositions have been approved in principle, and survey work on these propositions will commence shortly with a view to subsequent construction, if found practicable. We are authorised to inform the Ruler of Qatar to this effect: (a) A Terminal Dock at Si Arrif on the south-east coast. (b) At Wekreh a launch jetty, some half a mile long, and a house are planned for the use of pilots. (c) On the west, some twenty-two miles south of Zekrit in the vicinity of Al Hamlab, a boat harbour is envisaged, at which two 125 feet barges can be discharged and small craft sheltered. (d) At Uram Bab, three kilometres inland from this boat harbour, the main permanent camp. (e) The construction of a road from the west coast at Umm Bab across the peninsula to the east coast as directly as possible to Jebel Vekreh. It is further proposed that this road should be crossed by another from Dohah to the south passing near the jebel Tahar, thence to the projected terminal site in the vicinity of El Arrif (the road across the peninsula would probably follow the pipeline route as closely as possible). 2. We assume that there is no objection to the company informing the Ruler of propositions (b) (c) (d) and (e). 3. As regards (a), we note that you wish to learn the map co-ordinates of the El Arrif site from H.M.3. 'Challenger' before confirming that the site is in Qatar territory. Unless this information can be furnished in the near future and as a Company marine party recently visited the area and more activity is planned apart from the appearance of H.M.S. 'Challenger' on the scene, we feel that our communication to the Ruler should not be delayed, and there is no harm in assuming El Arrif is in Qatar territory for the purpose of this communication to him. 4. Will you please return the draft forwarded with our No.4598 as we shall be changing it to cover the above propositions including (a) if you agree. NS.mxmmsmm r \ % ’ \ 13. U. 'V? 1 EXT.261/47« C.A.

We have now received a letter from the Political Resident containing the recommendations of the Political Agent at Bahrein and toe- comments of' tlio Polities-l Rejii'dtiit on them. This letter is too long to copy in its entirety and I am accordingly summarising the geographical recommendations and am enclosing copies of the two maps we have received from the Political Resident. 3. The problem of division may be divided into three questions^ as it relates to (a) The Mftwar Group of islands (b) The seabed generally and (c) The Dibal and Jaradah shoals 4. In correspondence ending with*Government of India letter No. F.220-N/39 of the 1st July 1939 it was decided that 'liAwar and the small, barren and uninhabited islands and rock islets' were to be awarded to Bahrein. No decision was made at the time, however, as to the extent of the jurisdiction of p Bahrein over the waters surrounding the H/war Archipelago-or as to which islands were to be considered as being within the J&amp;war Group. 5. -^'idonee as to the number of^i^ands actually in the Hawar Group oompl ion ting. ’’'The Political Agent considers that the lists submitted by the /Bahreinmmmmmmmmgmm M;,/ p '0 ♦ 4 r- Bahrein Government in 1938 in connection with the arbitration referred to should he taken as final. These include Hflpar itself and 16 other islands and islets as follows:- • ., . . . ? % I. South Sawa’d. • 2 - 4* A]fWfe.kara - three islands each with a beacon. 5# B’-^adad Rocks (four rocks) 6 - 9. Bufl a'ada Islands (four small islands) 10. a ](fctahzawa. II. North Sawa/’d 12 - 13 . A1 tfajiat (two islands) 14• Ajaira ^15 * idbadh 16. A1 Mataradh 6. The Political Agent considers that the island of*Janan south of HAwar should be definitely excluded frcm the group &amp; for the following reasons;- (a) It is separated from the main group of islands by a deep water channel. (b) It flanks Zakerit Bay where Petroleum Concessions Limited have their landing place. oh • (c) It is not included in the list of islands referred to above and (d) It is ^bparently connectec/jvi^h the^Ras Awainat ■ila. ^ 1. 7. After careful investigations on the subject the Political Agent decided that all the islands mentioned in paragraph.5 above should be considered as being part of the IlA’aar Group, Cairns have been built on many of them by the Bahrein Government and all of these, with the possible exception of Ajaira definitely depend from HAwar. In no case would any useful purpose be served in separating them mi main island* UtjUj X ^ To arrive at an equitable i 0 ii.&gt;arting lr;.r* ^ fa ‘fl a fa* ^ ^ and Qatar the Political Agent has nat^cted the idea as ^ territorial waters as gerjA^tnlly understood as encroaching ^*&lt;5 Q / to■ ■■■■■■■■■ CXl't . to an un^ustiftable extent on Qata^rights. reoamends instead-th^-t a delimitjjHg line should ^i.n^ the -whole group which woul^^hus form enclave igt In leTI 1 itT5rpV-^gm.s appears necessary because the group is partially within Qataftterritorial waters and entirel^on the Qataffside of the median line between /fcPcrfflJ and Qj.4!aft(soe ^'arrgp/Tuph 10 bcluw). /fftie 1 Ine should UlCbt /fc ae in accordance' wa^th territorial waters //u uthF r s a.'n the should on the J^ast be }'ieiA*p+' do if. i del arbitrarily •b^-'fyiTO-full juirtlco to . t /U&lt;un*- UZ i ■HR ———lia mu—I i sww. (as follows: - Starting at a point three miles north of the northern tip of Hflwar it should be drawn roughly South-South- East to the low water line on the^iastem side of i ~ • Ajaira, thence J|puth to the point on the uSastem low water line of Sawad Shamaliyah (North Sav/ad) and on to the Jtastem low water line of Sawad Janubt.yah (South Sawad)/ thence the line should run to the median point of the gap in the '’causeway” of innumerable small rocks stretching from Bu Sadad to Qatafc. The Political Agent reports that apart from this gap of about 50 yards roughly midway between Bu Sadad and Qatar? it is possible to step from rock to rock and pass across dry shod. Thence to the 'Pirates' Channel' (a channel of deep water leading from the causeway through a shallow lagoon south of the causeway to deeper water beyond, said to have been tul-H: by a pirate chief, and easily recognisable) and so to the .Eastern low water line of the 'Ta.il” of IiAwar. From there it should follow.the low water line as far as the 'fiump” whence it should be continued out to sea in a westerly direction for three miles and so along the coast line at a diot-gtyioo^/of three miles to join the starting point. The Political Agent adds that the Western coast of /H«war-dAfwar shown In th© map is inaccurate. 10. o.he next problem is to lix a^/median line between Bahrein and Qata&amp;. The Political Agent has suggested a line (shown in red on Map 2) which' the Political Hesident has rejected as being too complicated and giving too much to Bahrein in the North and too much to Qatartin the South, The Political Resident has aeroly, suggested as the most equitable the following line; starting from the point where a line drawn due South from the tip of Has al Barr intersects the 25° 30 * / line of latitude to a point midway between the tip of Ras al Barr and Naqaiyah ' on the Qataflmainland, thence in a straight line to , , ^ OOOV t_ i^WT the Nortn Sitra and thence to the Bahrein line' so offiolal. Since the suggest^ demarication line for the liAwar G-roup passes near to this line that group \ (UtuA /(jL ( excluding Jan^jfrnaght we ii/be linked to the line as a salient. The Political Resident's line is marked on the map in blue but It may be noted that the point he has marked as midway between Ras al Barr and Naqaiyali is actually over two miles nearer Naqaiyah. The correct line according to his description is shown in green dots. 11. Finally the limits of the Dibal and Jaradah Shoals must be decided. It. may be stated to 'begin with that the ownership of these shoals is in some doubt but that ohe evidence available points to their belonging to Bahrein. In that event they will have to be a^^erKflave [ C/\ t/9^ oS-Brinhrffi)! Trirriteiy in Qata/iwaters.

The Hon'ble Lieutenant Colonel W. R. Hay, C.S.I., C.I.E., Political Resident, Persian Gulf. His Majesty*s Secretary of State for India, India Office, LONDON. (raj* Sir, j I have the honour to forward herewith a copy of the Political Agent, Bahrain*s express letter No. C/1450, dated the 31st December, 1946, containing his recommendations regarding the division of the sea-bed between Bahrain and Qatar as desired in paragraph 4 of your express letter No. Ext. 4952/46, dated the 3rd August, 1946. 2* I will deal with the Political Agent* s recommen dations separately as they relate to : - ( 4 ) the Hawar group of islands 5 (b) the Dibal and Jaradah reefs 5 and (c) the sea-bed generally. 3. The Hawar group of islands is dealt with in paragraphs 8 to 19 of the Political Agent*s letter. After visiting the islands and examining the situation on the spot with the greatest care, he has recommended that the whole group, with the exception of Janan, should be regarded as belonging to Bahrain. Janan has been excluded because it (a) is separated from the main group of islands by a deep water channel, (b) flanks the Zakerit bay where Petroleum Concessions Limited have their landing place, and (c) is not included • •»•page 2 not included in the list of islands submitted by the Bahrain Government in 1938 when the question of the ownership of the Hawar group was being decided* I consider these arguments, especially (a) and (c) valid although I must call attention to the point that Janan was definitely included in the area for which Petroleum Concessions Limited were negotiating with the Bahrain Government in 1938 - 39* I accordingly recommend that the Political Agent's proposals regarding the distri bution of the islands be accepted and that the Bahrain Petroleum Company be given permission to drill at points G, H, I &amp; J, vide the enclosure to Political Agent, Bahrain's express letter No. C/528, dated the 3rd May , 1946, copy of which was forwarded to you under my express letter No. C/220, date d the 4th June, 1946* 4. The Political Agent's recommendations regarding the delimiting line for the Hawar group are somewhat complicated, but I agree with his conclusion which is to the effect that the boundary should run around the outer edge of the group as closely as possible touching the low water level of the outermost islands on the eastern side within Qatar territorial waters, but that elsewhere it should follow the recognised three-mile limit of territorial waters. 5. The Dibal and Jaradah shoals are dealt with in paragraphs 22 to 31 of the Political Agent's letter. I , would note first that after consulting the Political Agent I suggest the spelling 'Dibal' for what is described as 'Jabal' in your express letter. This accords with the local Arab pronunciation and spelling, and is also the spelling used by Lorimer. 6 . As some of the facts regarding these shoals reported by the Political Agent in his letter are not quite clear I asked him to pay them a further visit which he did. As reported ....page 3. 'ftv As reported by iiiiu to me verbally* the facts are as follows* On both shoals there is a cairn and an artesian well bored by the Bahrain Petroleum Company on behalf of the Bahrain Government through a contractor* Dibal consists of a coral reef which is completely submerged at high water except for the cairn built by the Bahrain Government* the base of which is submerged and a small square of wall built to protect the head of the well which is damaged and out of action. There is no rock above high water level as stated by Mr. Belgrave vide paragraph 26 of the Political Agents letter. Jarada h is a sand-bank and when the Political Agent visited at a neap high tide* he found an area of about thirty yards by ten yards above the water level. This was dry and bore the tracks of birds and appeared not to have been recently sub merged. The Political Agent reports that he has always seen some land exposed whenever he has passed the shoal. The base of the cairn and the artesian well which is sealed are both below high water level* 7 . With regard to the ownership of these two places 1 reluctantly agree with the Political Agent that if it is possible for any body to establish a claim over shoals of the kind described* they must be regarded as belonging to Bahrain. They have been treated by the Bahrain Government as their property and beacons have been erected and wells bored without any kind of protest by the Shaikh of Qatar. In fact, as the Political Agent points out, the Shaikh of Qatar is a late arrival on the scene. He only consolidated his position on the mainland as recently as 1937 and has not taken steps to establish his position over neighbouring islands and shoals. Halul, for instance* which would seem naturally to fall to Qatar* we recognise as belonging to Abu Dhabi vide 'D' of India Office paper N o. dated the2 7th August* 1928 . Further His Majesty* s Government and its officers ....page 4. its officers have acquiesced in these shoals being described as Bahrain property in the negotiations with Petroleum Conces sions Limited in 1938-39 vide Article I of the various draft agreements and the maps attached to them. My view is there fore that the two shoals should be assigned to Bahrain which has done all it can to establish its sovereignty over the places in the now outmoded style of empire-building without any kind of protest from Qatar. If, however, expert legal opinion is to the contrary, so much the better. 8 . I find myself, however, unable to agree with the Political Agent in his proposals regarding the delimiting line for the ownership of these shoals vide paragraph 24 of his letter and particularly with his argument that the three- fathom curve should be chosen because it includes the points where the Bahrain Petroleum Company wants to drill. This is entirely begging the point. It seems absurd to regard a shoal which is itself part of a shelf as having its own shelf, and it is in any case hardly possible in the present instance to select the three-fathom line as the limit of the shoals* shelf as according to the charts they are linked up at this depth with both the Qatar peninsula and the Bahrain Islands. I consider therefore that if these shoals are to be regarded as the property of Bahrain they should be delimited by their low water levels or that at the most they should be regarded as having a radius of territorial waters up to the three-mile limit*. In either case points E &amp; F where the Bahrain Petroleum Company wish to drill will be excluded from Bahrain limits. 9. 1 am also .... *It would appear from § 190(a), Oppenheim Volume I, that Dlbal, none of which is above high water level can have no territorial waters. Such waters ought perhaps to be assigned to Jaradah on the assumption that a part of it is above high water level. ^ 311 ^ s l an&lt; ** Until however this assumption is verified by a survey no drilling should be allowed below the low water level.9 I am also unable to support the Political Agents page 5 proposals regarding the division of the sea-bed vide paragraphs 20 - 22 of his letter, as these, in my opinion, give Bahrain less than its share in the south and more in the north, I consider that the division should be made wherever possible by a strictly median line more or less as shown in the enclosure of Harrisons demi official letter No, E xt,6946/46, dated the 23rd October, 1946, to Gage. This line should start roughly from the point where a line drawn due South from the tip of Ras al Barr intersects the 26° 30* line of latitude run from there to a point midway between the tip of Ras al Barr and the shore of the Qatar peninsula at Naqaiyah and thence in a straight line to the North Sitra buoy and from there to the Bahrain light vessel. The Hawar islands (excluding Janan) should be linked up to this line as a salient and the Dibal and Jaradah shoals should be shown as enclaves of Bahrain property on the Qatar side of the line I would note that the line proposed by me, and 10 even that proposed by the Political Agent takes away from t Bahrain Government much of the sea-bed that was shown as be ging to them in draft agreements drawn up during the nego tiations between them and the Petroleum Concessions Limited 1938 and 1939. I cannot however find that we ever committ ourselves to recognising the limits defined in the draft ag ment as belonging to Bahrain. In the agreement for the un allotted area finally concluded with the Bahrain Petroleum Company, the area is described as 'All lands, islands, shoa reefs, waters and submerged lands over which the Shaikh now dominion or which may, after the date of this Deed, come un the dominion of the Shaikh or his Successors during the per of fifty-five years from the date of this Deed, or any exte of such period, are in this Deed called the •Shaikh 1 s prese and future dominions ,,, and no attempt is made to define its limits. The general principle I consider should be follow is to divide •. • •page 6. ^ PX J30t ' t* 1 / is to divide the sea-bed by a median line cf. the last'^ sentence of paragraph 3 of my predecessors teleg r am No, 366, dated the 7th June, 1940, but to make exceptions to this rule where Bahrain has definitely established her sovereignty over islands or shoals on the Qatar side of the line. Bahrain*s share of the sea-bed in the vicinity of these islands should however be reduced to a minimum. 11. It remains to be considered whether either of the Oil Companies or the Shaikhs concerned should be consulted before a decision is reached. I see no prospect of obtaining the agreement of the Shaikhs, relations between whom are already strained over the question of Zubarah. The Shaikh of Bahrain would never accept a decision which ignores his claim to that place and clearly recognises its inclusion in the Shaikhdom of Qatar while the Shaikh of Qatar would never acquiesce in the allotment of the Hawar islands and the Dibal and Jaradah shoals to Bahrain. In view of the knov/n attitude of the Shaikhs I consider it unfair to consult the Companies neither of which could be expected to prejudice its position by con curring in a proposal which it knows to be unpalatable to the Shaikh upon whom it is dependent for its concession. Inciden tally Petroleum Concessions Limited has not yet obtained a concession for the Qatar shoals and islands. 12 . I would suggest therefore that an announcement should be made that pending a proper survey of the waters concerned His Majesty*s Government regards the line described in paragraph 9 as the boundary so far as the sea-bed is con cerned between Bahrain and Qatar and that to the east of this line it recognises the sovereignty of Bahrain over the Hawar islands (excluding Janan) and the Dibal and Jaradah shoals down to the spring-tide low water level only. In the case of the Hawar islands, the sea-bed between them inside a line drawn round the outermost islands at low water level will also be recognised as • • • •will apply to the sea-bed between the Dibal and Jaradah shoals IS. It is for consideration whether this announcement should be made in an absolute form from the beginning or whether an opportunity should be given to the parties concerned to raise objections to it. I am inclined to favour the latter alternative. It is unlikely that either of the Shaikhs will be able to produce any fresh facts but it is possible that one or other of the Companies may have practical objections to raise which ought to be seriously considered. I would there fore propose that the announcement in the first place should be made in a tentative form and that six months should be allowed for the raising of objections. 14. If my proposals are accepted it will mean that the Bahrain Petroleum Company can be allowed to drill at points H, I, G &amp; J in the map forwarded with my express letter No. C/220, dated the 4th June, 1946, but that they cannot be per mitted to drill at points E &amp; F. i 15. The waters concerned are for the most part not included in those to be surveyed by H.M.S. Challenger vide India Office express letter No. Ext.6416/46, dated the 24 th Sept ember, 1946 , and I would suggest that they should be added to her programme and surveyed as soon as possible. When this survey has been completed charts should be prepared showing the median line between Bahrain and Qatar, either on the rough basis proposed or accurately plotted with reference to the conformation of the land on either side, and the limits of Bahrain ownership in the Hawar island group and the Dibal and Jaradah shoals. Copies of the charts should be supplied to the parties concerned. 16. As mentioned incidentally in paragraph 11 abovte the decision proposed will have some bearing on the Shaikh of Bahrain* s claim to ....page 8 Bahrain^ claim to Zubarah vide my letter No, C/767 , dated''— &gt; („ 121 Lip the 26th August ? 1946« This question is under constant discussion with the Shaikh and I am considering the terms of a communication which I propose to ask the Political Agent to make to him regarding it. I would only note here that the phrase 'They expelled the A1 Khalifah from the Zubarah area' under (z) in paragraph 30 of the Political Agent*s letter would be more accurately expressed as 'They eliminated A1 Khalifah influence from the Zubarah area'. 17* In conclusion I should like to express my appreciation of the trouble Colonel Galloway has taken over this case. He has spent several days in visiting the islands and shoals concerned and the facts he has collected and the views he has expressed are of great value. 18. I forward two copies of each of the two maps received with the Political Agent, Bahrain*s express letter. I have marked in blue in map II the boundary I have proposed in paragraph 9.

This accounts for the question of ownership of point 1 j». r t is situated near Hawar, but is it in the *group*? , 1 shall, therefore, in so far as this area is concerned, base my recommendations on the hypotiiesis that Hawar and ’’Its islands” have been awarded to Bahrain, and that i am to suggest a delimiting line for Hawar, the actual islands and shoals in its vicinity and a delimiting line for them. |CP lie * 5 * ^ regards the continental shelf (cf. your para. . Ul f arbitrarily fixed for the shelf principle is not applicable to the area under consideration and neither, does the modification of the principle to the 10 fathom line, and certainly not the 20 fathom line. The shelf principle when it can be of assistance at all, will then, have to be further modified to suit local conditions. 6 ; ^ ^ recommendations for the course the dividing line should follow are contained in the subsequent paragraphs. The line does not in its whole length conform with the line marked on chart Asia, Persian Gulf, (subsequently referred to as chart A.P.Q.), and for any divergence, and indeed for the whole suggested line, I have given my reasons. ZA k- Th as tar tingpoIn t raarkad on chart A.P.G. appears to be the northern termination point of the nlyadh Lino, andIs not th® most southerly point of the Duh&amp;t as oalwa. I^agree that this point is suitable, and from it the line should run in a general northerly direction dividing the ruhnfc into two equal parts until the line joins the line dividing the daudi Arabian Qatar and Bahrain sea-bed* This will be outside territorial waters* 3. as regards the Hawar *group 1 and the delimiting line In that area: the actual Islands, as I have stated in paragraph 3 above, were not individually considered at the time Hawar was allotted to Bahrain, vide Agency letter . j/266-1 *a/ 29 dated the 32nd April. 1939* but were assumed to foru a group 'and so went to Bahrain together &gt;/d th Hawar island* The Bahrain Government have submitted, at least three conflicting statements of the composition of the * group 1 • in August, 1937, it was stated that there were nine islands in the 'Hawar archipelago, in 1938 their list included Hawar and 16 islands or groups of islets, and in 1946 the list comprised Hawar and 17. 9. .rhe I93B list was submitted in connection with the Hawar arbitration, and x propose to take that as their con sidered claim, particularly as no explanations have ever been given for changes, the names of Island or group of islets and the numbers of the beacons are as follows:- 1. South S&amp;wad (yawad - Black) 2. hi Wakara (1) (Hawk’s stand.) •3. -do- (2) 4. -do- (3) 5. Bu Sedad rocks, four rocks. 6 . Bu Saada islands - four small islands* 7. 8 . ’ 9* « 10 . AX H&amp;hs&amp;oura. 11 * north SawadU 12. Al Hajiat (the female Hajis) - two Islands 13* 14. Ajaira. (the widow) 15* Babadh* 16* Al Ka* turadh (the intervener). 10* The Oil Companies* conception of Hawar and its ♦group* differs in the documents I have been able to trace* For instance, in the draft of the proposed Hawar Lease of 1939 Hawar is said to comprise 14 islands, they are not named, but it also includes the territorial waters to the west of Hawar Island. In the draft leases of 1938 and 1939 map co-ordinates are used but they do not help for they show the area in general only. 11* The Shaikh of Qatar told me that there were 19 Islands In the group, but I can find nothing in writing to that effect, borixaer did not know of a »group*, and only mentions in the area individually* it will be seen how vague the conception of the group is, and also how it lias increased in size with the growing importance of the area. 12. Despite vagueness about the detailed composition /of•3- of the group, the two oil Companies clearly have the general impression that they were bargaining for e&amp;war and all islands and shoals in the vicinity, and that must amount to their maximum expectations, fhey also knew that the definition of the area to be leased had not been officially accepted, and if the delimitation of the ’group’ now excludes some shoals and islands they will have to put a good face on it* 13. Before a delimiting line can be drawn the com position of the ’group* must be decided, and Janan lends itself to separate treatment and is a convenient starting point. The line on chart A.F.G. is drawn covering the island of Janan, which lies just south of H&amp;war, ax which flanks the entrance to the Duh&amp;t Az Zagreet in which lies the P.C.L. landing place, gagreet,Phe Island was Included in the Additional Area on the plans annexed to the draft leases. rh@ deep water channel lies between Hawar and Janan, and as Haw&amp;r belongs to Bahrain if Janan is to be considered as an island of the ’group* then the entrance to the Duhat Az Za.grmet would be controlled by aixrain and the Bahrain Petroleum company. That state of affairs .would be most undesirable, for example a rig might be erected and block the channel. 14. Janan is shown on charts and plans as a pimple of an island, but, in fact, at low tide it shows a long low reef rising above the sea. It is dry at ail tides at its western end, and dries out a long way towards the mainland. It has not been surveyed, but to the layman it appears to be part of the Has Awainat All feature, and completely separate from ffawar. The island is barren, but is used by Bahrain fishermen, and I dare say by Qataris on occasions, it has neither water nor habitation, and beyond the erection of a cairn by the Bahrain Government I know of no justification for their claim to ownership, the erection of a calm should, in my opinion, be given but little consideration since It was not included An the Bahrain Government’s 1938 list.' Further the eastern half of the Island lies within yat&amp;r territorial waters and south of the deep water channel which runs close to Janan and not Hawar. For these reasons, I am of the opinion that it is not and should not be considered to be a member of the ’group’ and should be awarded to Qatar and included in their side of the dividing line. 13. To assign to the Hawar ’group* the various islands as enumerated in paragraph 9 above, they mist be reviewed individually or in sub-groups.. (a) Bet ’x* be a sub-group comprised of the two outlying islands, ms. 15 and 16, situated to the north and north-west of Hawar. They are separated from each other by only a few feet of water at low tide, and there is only a very narrow channel cutting tne scarcely submerged isthmus between Habadh (Mo.15) and Hawar. They form a protecting reef to Hawar and without them there ‘ would be no anchorage against the strong north-west winds. Beyond tills and Bahrain’s appropriation of them by means of building cairns, I do not find that there is any /connec tion~4~ connection betweexi thorn and Bahrain. Nevertheless, they are quite clearly a part of the -lawar structure, and should toe considered to form part of the ’group*. (to) No. 14, Ajeira t is an escarpment sittiated • some 2 miles to the north of If a war and is the counter* part of j&amp;n&amp;n in the south* it commands the entrance to the H&amp;vmr anchorage. There is deep water bo tween it and Fa,war and also between it and Qatar, but it does not lie in the territorial waters of the latter. It appears to be the northern limit of the . : ,owacI r*®f of which jagged rocks appear at certain tides. There is no evidence that I know of, other than the building of a cairn by Bahrain, to give an indication of owner* ship and x m in some doubt if it really beongs to the group. Nevertheless 1 know of no good purpose to be served in separating it, arid I think it should be included. (c) Nos. 10, 12 and 13 can be considered sub-group *y» composed of small barren islands, islets and roomy protuberances situated off the eastern shore of iiawar. They lie tucked within the natural barrier formed by sub-group *z*. see (d) below, and such is their position that without Hawar'they can scarcely be said to have any significance at all. Without doubt they must be considered part of the * group 1 . (d) Bub-group * z' is comprised of the mawads, the akara, the Bu ha*&amp;€ia and Bu dadad. At one time, Hawar Island was probably part of Qatar and has been separated by the flow of the tide In the course of the ages leaving sub-group * z * in the channel between the two. The natural barrier they form and their connection with awar are not so obvious from the map, but on the spot this is most striking. Baw&amp;d ahamaliyah (No.11) is a broad pancake of an island protruding some 6 feet above high tide, and is separated from Hawar by a narrow sea channel approximately 2 fathoms in depth. It is, however,.about 3 miles from vatar. This channel shelves to less than a fathom at its 'south end and stays approxi mately at that depth as far south as the irawar-janan channel. (There are deeper patches of course). The nuk&amp;ra arc but mushroom-capped cliffs protruding fro© this shallow sea-bed in the gap toetween the two Sawads* b&amp;w&amp;d j&amp;nubiy&amp;h is another pancake island sloping gradually into the sea at its southern end, then to the south, after a stretch of very shallow sea, the Bu badad rises from the flats. (e) Bu sadad, as the name in Arabic suggests, could fairly be described as a causeway. The sea here is vary shallow, and is dotted with innumerable rocks in such profusion as almost to out-number the cormorants, and to permit of stepping from one to another and arriving dry footed on Qatar. There is, however, a gap of shallow sea of some 50 yards in breadth about the middle of this causeway. j*(f) i r n® m -la’sicia lie to the wast of the causeway across a arjall expanse of sea and are the connecting •'&gt; feature between the * causeway * and Sawad Janublyali, thus completing the r«ef. south of tlae causeway ia a lagoon of even depth of roughly a fathom, except that from the causeway running southwards Is a channel said to have . been cut by some pirate chief years ago to enable him to escape from the lagoon when almost surrounded by foes. The lagoon is bounded on the south by the tail of Hawar. There is a narrow channel between the tip of the tail and oatar 9 but the Idea that at certain tides a sand bank is visible above the water and joins Hewar and Qatar appears to Me to be unlikely? particularly whan the smallness of the rise and fall of the tide is renembered. This sub-group lies almost wholly within Qatar territorial waters, but to the north of the causeway Is separated by an expanse of eea. At the causeway It is almost joined to Qatar and again Bawar is almost joined to . f: atar at the southern end. there is, nevertheless, If we consider the gap at the causeway, a distinct strait between the two which separates the sub-group from Qatar, to the non-expert the islands and Islets to the west of the strait appear to foe part of the Bawar feature, and I personally think that they appertain to Hawar. 16* It Is now necessary to select an equitable method of arriving at the delimiting line for Hawar and the * group*, and the possible methods which occur arej- (a) The continental shelf or modified continental shelf principle! (b) By territorial water limits! (c) By an arbitrary line! (d) By the low tide level; («) By the high tide level. ^y^vvv t yp*vr fr \P^ tor* P &gt; ytr 4 17. .Of these methods (a) can be eliminated since, although the ’group* belongs to Bahrain, It is situated on the Qatar shelf ami mm® part of it even within Qatar territorial waters# For the latter reason the 'group* cannot have territorial waters of its own In the full meaning of the word, (b) could foe applied arbitrarily to lawar itself on its western coast, but not to the islands of the group nor Hawar itself in the east, because owing to the proximity of Qatar this would entail'unjusti fiable encroachment on atar rights. Between (d) and (e) there is little difference to the layman since the rise and fail of the tide is only 3 or 4 feet* But the difference to an Oil Company Is considerable, due to the fact that shoals and sand-banks submerged at high tide show above the surface of the sea at low tide and often extend many miles into the i-ea? these are of significance to them. Because the sea-bed and shoal area has not been surveyed and in order to give to mil the islands of the ’group* their proper fore-shore and share of shoals a combination of methods is necessary. Consequently, ay recommendation6 - is that (c) - necessary to IlnK up the islands because it is scarcely practicable to ring each Island and islet ~ should be used in conjunction with (b) and (d). It will be seen that (e) cannot be applied, for to do so would exclude the above desiderata. 18. Prom paragraph 15 it will be seen that I an of the opinion that the islands form a ,?roup and j recommend that a delimiting line arrived at by methods (fc) f (e) and (d) should ring that group. It would then become a Bahrain enclave situated to the oast of the Qatar-Bahrain sea- dividing-line. My reasons for deciding on an enclave are that the group Is situated partly in atar terri torial wat-: is nearer the shores of Qatar than the median line Arc leef f vide paragraph 20 below. fha sea between the west of the * group* and Arc Heef may contain shoals and. shallows outside the ‘group* enclave which.may De of value, and I see no reason why because Mawar group is in close proximity to atar, Qatar should be deprived of these shoals. This would happen if the line as suggested on chart A.P.G. were followed. 19. rh© line then, starting from 3 miles north of the northern tip of u&amp;war should be drawn southwards to the iow water line of Ajeira on. the east, and thence south to the point on the eastern low water line of bawud bhumaliyah, and on to sawad Janubiyah. Thence to the median line of the ’causeway’, down to pirate’s channel, and to the eastern low tide'line of the tail of Kawar. From there it should follow the low water line of the tail (since Hawar is now in ^a.tar territorial waters), and at the rump be continued for three miles in a westerly direction out to-sea. From there it should follow the coast line at the territorial water limit and so northwards to join ails, the starting point. I have actually traced a line on an enlargement of which copies are enclosed, but X should like to point out that the enlargements are misleading in that they are not at all exact. 20. Turning from the Hawar group the median line between .a,tar and Bahrain should be established. .his must obviously start from the intersection of the taudi Arabian-Bahrain- .•atar sea limits, and this point readily suggests itself to be the southerly extremity of Arc Beef which forms an arc round the southern end of Bahrain island. It is a well defined reef, marked on charts and extends from Aellaq through Ghasaar hock, round the south end of Bahrain Island and on in a northerly direction until it terminates in deep water at a point approximately ! 26.55 F. 50.50. This point may be called BBS. Arc reef, is part of the Bahrain structure, but it lies outside their territorial waters., On it are situated many islands used by Bahrain fishermen, and as it happens to coincide approximately with the median line between ,*atar and Bahrain and is a natural barrier, its contour should be followed (leaving the feature to Bahrain) as the delimiting line. /21. At point1. 21. At point ttie sea deepens and the shoal structure alters, it gives no further guide so the line must either be drawn to Pasht Adham (BAPCO 109) or continued arbitrarily in a northerly aL ection. The Pasht Adham is a well known mariners* mark with a small peak dry at all tides and it definitely belongs to Bahrain. It is, however, not centrally situated and to adopt it would add a further complication* I suggest therefore, that from B3S the line should be drawn in a northerly direction approximately dividing the area into two equal parts as far as point *f*, vide chart BB 486 a copy of which was enclosed with my Express Letter dateE Una '-?3rd of 1946. 22. From t F 1 the line should follow the 3 fatnom curve round Jar ad eh arid Deeb&amp;l on the ©astern side as far as BaPCO mark 10? on the north shore of Deebal. Prom tilere it should be drawn in a north-westerly direction to the North ultra Buoy* » 23. . ehis means that the pashts Jaradeh and deebal are included in the Bahrain area, arid my reasons for consider ing the fashts Bahrain, territory have already been conveyed to you in my Express Letter referred to earlier. In order to present a composite picture it has been repeated in this letter with modifications to conform with the views expressed in India Office Express Letter Mo*Rxt.4952/46 dated the 2nd foil lUx-ib/ of Au gust, 1046 ,. and also to correct certain statements I ' which after further examination of the papers and the area itself became necessary. Before considering the claims to ownership it would be appropriate to explain my reason for selecting the 3 fathom curve as the delimiting line of the Jaradeh and Deebal feature. 24. The deepest fathom curve of the fasht is til® 6 fathom curve which is not within the modified continental shelf principle of 10 fathoms, cf. paragraph 8 of the Foreign Office Memorandum referred to earlier. The principle cannot be further modified to follow the 6 fathom curve because then Bahrain, ^atar and the Fasht would be on one and the same shelf, to follow that curve, therefore, would be reductio ad absurdum . Hie territorial water line - leaving a s id© any'con sid era tion as to whether an uninhabited shoal or sand-bank does h&amp;v© territorial waters - cannot be used since the extent of the shoal in which Oil Companies are interested lie beyond these limits. A fathom curve lias, therefore, to be used and as the 3 fathom curve readily suggests Itself as being natural and equitable and also because it includes points , F’ and «!•, see map BB 486, I have selected it as the delimiting line. 25. Unlike the Rawer group where the ownership was known and where it was only necessary to delimit its extent, in the case of Jaradeh and Deebal both ownership and limits are unknown. They have to be decided and j, therefor©, asked both the shaikhs of Bahrain and Qatar if they claimed ownership over the shoal, and if so to give me their reasons. 26. Bahrain*s claims arej- /'♦ In the yearf, In the year 1936 the Bahrain Government built beacons on the Fasht-al-Beebal. one of the beacons was built on the rock at the north end of the fasht which is above water. His late Highness Shaikh Hamad and the pre sent Ruler have always regarded this fasht as being owned by Bahrain, The anchorage there is used exclusively by Bahrain boatmen and fishermen and the fasht is one of those which are considered to belong to Bahrain*'. and secondly, what is described as a chief claim, ^the chief claim that Bahrain has to the shoals and islands lying between Bahrain and. Qatar is based upon the fact that at one time Qatar belonged to the ihaikhs of Bahrain who subsequently became possessed of Bahrain and, - therefore, acquired the shoals and islands lying between the two shores. At a later date the grandfather of the present Jhaikh of Qatar became the Ruler of Qatar but did not at any time assert his authority over the Islands between Qatar ana Bahrain ? . the above two statements are made by the Adviser and the following extract is what might be termed the official claim contained in the Adviser's letter Mo*2223-9A of the 20th October, 1946s !, Fashts Beebel and Jar ad eh lie within the area which was subject to negotiations between the Bahrain Government and petroleum Concessions L&amp;d., and Bahrain petroleum company Limited in the year 1938 whan both these companies were , competing for an oil concession over the addi tional area, not included in the area granted by the original concession. During all these negotiations the Political Agent, Bahrain, was present, also His Highness Chaikh culman, myself and usually cfaaikh Abdulla bin Isa. The petroleum Concessions Limited produced a map, an enlargement of one made by the Land Department, on which the Company marked in red ink th© area over which they sought a concession, it is possible that you have a copy of this map in your files, but in case this is not so i mm forwarding my own copy, which please return. During all the talks on the subject no question was ever raised which would throw any doubt on Bahrain's ownership to this group of shoals and islands and when eventually the con cession was granted to the Bahrain petroleum company Limited, the boundaries of the concession area, lying between Bahrain and Qatar included the two fashts in question. Therefore, at a later date, the Bahrain Petroleum company Ltd., was permitted to drill an artesian well in the island at Jaradeh which was for the benefit of Bahrain boats in that locality. M27. the sha 1946s- atar * s claims to the fashIs are s la ted kh of Qatar*a letter to me of the 13th in ,Tiixy tf ■'four Excellenc/ knows that the name with which Bahrain is known at present is not its original nane f but Bahrain is a general name for the western Arab territories bordering the western coasts of the Gulf, this (Bahrain) is only (A * wal) and (a * wal) is an island in Bahrain, and it 1$ understood that this island has no dependencies, coasts, and islands* if we look into the question from the point of view of equality, Qatar is to be entrusted with 1 eebal and Jaradeh Pashts which are situated between Qatar and Bahrain, and they are nearer to qat&amp;r. You see that jatar has been treated unjustly in her clear right in the question of Hawar islands which I m still tenacious as claiming as belonging to me, then how much more so the othersr*. 28. The Bahrain claims to ownership can be summarised (a) the building of cairns in 1936,• (b) plain asseveration of ownership, (c) the exclusive use of the fashts by Bahrain f isherraen, (d) that the : haikhs of Bahrain were once haikhs of qatar as well and when they lost -a tar they retained the ownership of the fashts lying between. Qatar and Bahrain, and (a) negotiations for the 'additional area' covered territory inclusive of the two fashts in question, and in consequence of which the Bahrain petroleum ;ompany were permitted to drill an artesian well in Jaradeh. 29. uy comments are (a), the building of a cairn on a shoal is not conclusive proof of ownership, but is evidence of a Government*s desire to establish rights. I see, however, from paragraph 4 of India office Express Getter Go*-1593/46 ted Uio Bod aueu:.; u, 1946 . that J am to discount as far as possible the recent assertions of the Bahrain Government to ownership through the building of cairns. But X cannot disregard certain arguments which, fcagefclmjaani together with past and modern history, may amount to ownership for at least a number of years. These arguments are;- (a) In the case of Arab! and Farsi the political Kesident advocated the making of an'outward and visible sign of ownership', vide enclosures to India Office Complimentary Blip H o.P.Z.7023/1937 ^ dated the-16 th^^ ie mber. 1937 . The building of a cairn amounts' to' si''-m the same thing, and I taink his advice should be admissible to Bahrain if the Bahrain aovernment wlah to make use of it* /(b)4 ( QMX 1m » 10 ~ (b) Asseverations without corroborative evidence do not constitute proof, but in this case the/ should be given consideration when the difficulty of providing tangible proof is so great, in actual fact, I believe that the fashts are regarded locally as belonging to Bahrain. The Foreign Office Legal Adviser 'has reminded us that in these days, In order to keep islands which you claim, small and uninhabited though they be, it is necessary to display sovereignty fairly frequently, and to be able to produce arrangements for their administration, even if they are only paper arrangements. merely to put up a flag once is not enough', vide paragraph 7 of enclosure to India Office •:O mp 1 ime j i cary . 1 ip *«o. p .h. 263/1933 dated th e ^7tn JanuaryBahrain government erected a cairn, numbered it records. and registered the shoal in their land The Oil Ccmpany which holds the oil concession over Bahrain sunk, through a contractor, an artesian well on Deebal, and there is also a well on Jaradeh, though j do not know its history - the Deebal well has since been sealed. It is now for the lawyers to say whether the above amounts to ownership. (c) possibly Bahrain lime-*carrying boats use them more frequently than those of Qatar, and certainly Bahrain fishermen do visit the fashts. (d) pelgrave's statement is most difficult to follow. My comment is that the sheikhs of Bahrain were never Shaikhs of Qatar though the shaikh of Bahrain asserts that they did maintain an. 'aislr' for a short time on the eastern shores of the peninsula some 75 years ago. The Shaikhs of Hafdrain never actually war® Shaikhs of th* whole of the Qatar peninsula, and r have not been able to confirm this assertion of the Shaikh of Bahrain. (e) This is begging the question for It states what it is required to prove, neverthe!ess no objection was raised at the time of the sinking of the well on Deebal which might have been expected were Qatar at that time a rival claimant to the shoal. The inclusion of the shoals in the Additional Area was not commented on at the time of the negotia tions between the rival companies, though there was always the reservation that the area was subject to alteration in the light of sovereign and other claims should these ever aria®. %t might now b® unreasonable to say that the shoal belongs to tar, for if it is excluded from the Additional Area it would go to petroleum concessions Limited - the loser at the time of the original’bidding. The shoal has, when all is said and done, been considered to be within the Leased Area of the winner - SAPCO - for some ten years. A change now would, I imagine, entail financial compensa tion to BAPCO. (f) I see that the question of ownership was raised in esidency telegram Wo.338 dated, the 7th of June, /1940.. «**«*»-u- 1940* ’ ich regard to the fashts being unknown until 1929, Lorimer mentions that in 1878 **&amp; fleet of three Bahrain craft despatched by the Shaikh to patrol towards the fasht-al~!;• eebal proceeded instead to Has Mahan 1 *. This shows that the shoal has been immaxto known to Bahrain for over SO years, purely It must have been known to mariners for a thousand years past* As regards Qatar's claim my comments are;- (x) that hanrain being an island owns no fashts Is untrue* (y) It is true that the fashts. are nearer to ;;atar and also, a point not stated by the dh&amp;ikh of ,atar, that they are on the Qatar side of the deep water channel between Bahrain and Qatar, but in this region where the territorial water limits cannot apply in the accepted. British sense the points do not carry weight. The shaikh of t &gt;&amp;tar did not claim the shoal, cf. P.Z*1227/40 dated th e 12 th, of la rch * 1940..* Indeed 'Ehe , a tar s ta tement does not lay great stress on ownership, but suggests that the fashts be allocated to ,&amp; tar to satisfy the demands of justice, not because Qatar actually owns them. (s) It should be remembered that the Al Than! rose from being tribal headmen until with the assistance of the funks they eventually established themselves as the chief power on the eastern shores of the t atar peninsula, particularly at Bide and loha. By the time of the departure of the Turks and the maxing of the Treaty of 1916 they were recognised as oheikhs of _,atar. They continued to extend their influence and on the western shores they encountered the Al Khalifa and the tribes and inhabitants who still paid allegiance to that family. They expelled the Al Khalifa from the dubarah area on the west coast of the peninsula in 1937. /ashts and partially submerged shoals some wa f the western shores did not enter into their scheme of things - that is excluding ilawar and its adjacent islands to wfiich they still lay claim. 31. 'y view then, based on the claims submitted and taking into account local opinion, is that the fashts Keebal and jaradeh should be considered as Bahrain terri tory, but see paragraph 29 (b) above. 32. fhe ownership of the shoal and Us delimiting line having been discussed the-yatar-Bahraln dividing line must be continued, cf. paragraph 22. x think It is desirable from the shipping and the-Admiralty aspects that the deep .water channel should be in the kjosix i ain Area and under control of authorities at Bahrain* It would be correct therefore to draw the line from the horth Sitra Light Buoy to the Bahrain l ight vmsel (a convenient fixed point) and onwards in the same north-easterly direction until it terminates at the Persian Gulf Median Line. 33. ith reference to the acceptance of ny proposed line by the shaikhs, the Shaikh of Bahrain would agr ree Jw* ‘ i /to the....to the Deeb-ui proposal and to that of Hawar except that he might protost that Janan should be included in the Bahrain area* The Shaikh of ^at&amp;r util object to the Hawar decision since he has not accepted the original award, and also to the proposal to award the DeebaJ-Jaradeh shoal to Bahrain* 1 think he would acquiesce if the shoal were declared no man 1 s land, and in His i ajesty* s (fovernment 1 s gift, but only provided it were gifted to atar as some compensation for the loss of dawar* Sd. m. t* GALLOV.Af* Political Bgent, Bahrain.m D.C.

We snail be drafting a note of the tentative con clusions reached and will send you a cop 5 &gt; after agreeing it with the Americans, W object in writing to you now is to ask whether you would let us know how the working out of a medium line between Bahrein (and BAPCu) and Qatar (and P.C.L.) now stands. IQy impression/ is that the Political Agent has been asked to make his recommendation on this question for consideration in London, but that his report has not yet come in. I gather that the Foreign Office were not aware of this arrangement and it may be that this is due to its having been made ver bally with Galloway when he was on leave in the U.K. But I arn afraid 1 have not been able to make a thorough check of our papers owing to the pressure of our talks with the’Americans, which will continue to the end of this week.

If the information asked for is of the kind available to British and American oil interests in regard to companies jointly or severally owned by them and is also ordinarily available to their respective Governments I see no objection to its being supplied. i must say however that 1 think the action on the part of the American Consul, Dhahran, in wilting to the office of a company situated in the Bahrain Agency is an infringement of our position at Bahrain, even though it can be argued that he nas not gone outside the sphere of his legitimate functions as they were indicated m Cleary's letter ho.

Packer, Esq., Manager, Qatar &amp; Trucial Coast Operations, Petro leum Development Limited, Manama, Bahrain. You will recall that some time ago j spoke with you in regard to my instruction from the Department of state and from ^the U.S. Petroleum Attache at Cairo, requiring me to submit Reports in regard to petroleum resources, developments in petro leum production and marketing, and petroleum forecasts in this -consular district. Because of the great interest of many branches of the United States Government in this subject, I am instructed to make these reports as detailed and as exhaustive as possible, consisting in: 1. An initial report .on i»x&amp;xtaEK±JEg outstanding current petroleum problems. 2. Special reports on important developments at the time they arise. 3. Regular monthly reports on development of current problems, general items, and pertinent statistics. 4. Annual reports (or termination report on departure of the reporting officer) analyzing the problems of the preceding year (or period) and discussing probable future trends and developments. I mentioned to you at that time that since petroleum Development, Ltd., a 23.75$ share of which is owned by American interests, is now about to begin drilling and active development of its Qatar field; and since it is also planning further active surveys in the Trucial Coast and possibly other regions where it holds concession, I wished to submit direct to you the outline questionnaire transmitted to me by the petroleum Attache at Cairo, giving the types of information desired by the United States Government. You stated that you would transmit this questionnaire to your London headquarters, requesting instructions as to your reply to me. The questionnaire is enclosed, in duplicate, and I shall be grateful if you will forward it as rapidly as possible; since I am informed that your drilling string is arriving and may begin operations at an early date. With regard to the security of information contained in reports from this Consulate on petroleum matters, I am instructed to mark as confidential all items which are to be reserved for the exclusive perusal of principal officers of the Department and other branches of my Government. Consequently, any information which you provide to this office which is to be kept confidential had best be appropriately marked by you in order that I may follow your Company's wishes in this matter.14* Exploratory Activities (ContM) s Geophysical Eield Parties, location U 15.

The Sultan still hopes however that when the Imam,dies the tribes of the interior will ask him to rule over them. In reply to a question of mine he stated that he could almost certainly secure election as Imam but that he did not wish this as it would mean the continuance of on elective Imamate. He wishes to abolish the Imamato altogether and incorporate Oman in Muscat State. 5 # On the subject of oil explorertion I spoke to him on the lines proposed in paragraphs 5 and 6 of my Express Letter No.C/525 dated the 24th July 1946 emphasising the point made in your express letter under reply. He promised to think the whole matter over and let the Political Agent have his reply. He did however say that he would have no objection to the P.C.L. negotiating direct with the tribes at Ibri provided ground exploration only was intended and his position under the agreement was safeguarded and that he had already agreed to the Y/adi Howasinah being visited. He pointed out that Ibri was directly under the Imam's control - it is actually the headquarters of one of his Walls - and expressed some doubt whether the tribesmen who had invited Lermitte to visit their country (vide paragraph 3 of my express letter No.C/525 of 24th July) did so with the Imam's concurrence.

He felt that the Company should compensate him. He suggested a monthly payment of Rs.6000/-.

QATAR CONCESSION - INCREASES IN SALARIES OF SHAIKH'S REPRESENTATIVES In May 1946. the Ruler of Qatar drew attention to the fact that during the war salaries in general had been increased and the increased rates were still being paid. In these circumstances he felt it only equtable that the Company should increase the salaries of his two representatives. 2. The matter was referred to the Managing Director, London* who has authorised an Increase in the combined salaries from Rs. 1250/- to Rs. 2000/- per mensem. The offer was made to the Ruler and accepted. Incidents ily Saleh al Mana is one representative, but the identity of the second has never been officially disclosed. There is every reason to believe, however, that Shaikh Haraed draws this second salary.

They are now starting up operations there and want particularly to know their position as regards the waters between Qatar and the Hawar Islands (which, though lying off the Qatar Coast^were awarded to Bahrain by H.M.G. in 1939)* There seems t ’ ' J ttle doubt that oil exists under the sea between Bahrain and Qatar, W'ho drilling has so far been done there. The Bahrain Petroleum Company have had better opportunities to investigate the possibilities than P.C.L. and there are indications that they have substantial hopes of the oil prospects there. It is no doubt with reference to the terms of BAPCO’s Concession Areajthat the Bahrain Government have of recent years been erecting oi^^S^on various reefs and islets outside Territorial Waters with a view to claiming them for Bh£rain (it is doubtful however whether we can accept such a procedure as a valid method of adding territory to Bahrain). » li/U/} What I think we should aim at is to draw on the map a dividing line roughly midway between Bahrain and Qatar, thus demarcating once and for all the areas in which the prospective Oil Companies may operate. (I have drawn in a suggestion for such a line in red on the map indicating at the same time the extent of Bahrain and Qatar Territorial Waters). Once we start admitting claims of one or the other State to this (Ui 7 ^ or that reef or patch of sand outside Territorial Waters, we shall get l involved in endless disputes. It seems best that such a line should be drawn as soon as possible^ before the Oil Companies have had time to start drilling near the disputed areas. Meanwhile we should not let BAPCO drill near the doubtful area, not even on the Hawar Islands, if we can help it, though these Islands fall clearly within the Additional Area of BAPCO's Concession. H.M.G. must insist on having the last word in deciding just how this line should run. The line might be regarded f either as a working guide to the area in which H.M.G. are willing to permit the respective Oil Companies to operate, each Ruler automatically acquiring sovereignty over the particular spot where his own Concessionary Oil Company engages in operations, or as dividing the sea bed both within and without Territorial Waters between Bahrain and Qatar, and allotting to each Ruler sovereignty over his respective portion. In the latter/ case the application of the principles of President Truman’s Proclamation regarding the Continental Shelf is involved. (Papers have been recently submitted). The first step seems to be however to see whether the Political Agent can produce a recommendation for such a line.

With regard to paragraph 2 of your Express letter under reference, H.M.G. agree that the moratorium may now be terminated and that the Bahrein Petroleum Company may be allowed to undertake operations in the X area (jarim and Portuguese Fort area) on the assumption that Points B, C and D are all undisputably in Bahrein territory. They also agree that the Company should not, for the present at least, be allowed to under take operations in the Y and. J areas. (Jaradeh and Jabal group and Scwad Janubiya respectively). As regards the Z area (Hawar Islands) there can be no doubt that points H, I and G on the map lie within the Additional Area, but the exact extent of the Hawar Islands (i.e. the off-lying Islets and their territorial waters) never seems to have been accurately defined. If the Bahrain Petroleum Company are allowed to commence operations at points H, I and G on their map before the position has been cleared up, difficulties may arise owing to the Company wishing to extend, the scope of their operations from the main Island itself into the sea. It would therefore seem preferable that operations by the Company on the Hawar Islands should be deferred until the position has been further defined. If you see no objection, please inform them accordingly. 4. With reference to paragraph 6 of your Express letter, you will see from the enclosed correspondence that P.C.L. have themselves recently raised the question of the division of the waters between Bahrein and Qatar. It would seem desirable, if practicable, to lay down at a fairly early date some dividing line on the map to be regarded by both Companies and by the Rulers of Bahrain and Qatar as binding, not only in the area between the Hawar Islands and Qatar but also extending north from the Hawar Islands area to say, latitude 26° 30^ North. H.M.G. must reserve to themselves the ultimate right to decide the exact location of such a line, but the agreement of the interested parties is. desirable, and it would be easier to obtain this now when the oil development of these waters has not yet begun than at a later stage. /SuchSuch a line could be regarded either as simply demarcating the areas in which H.L.G. are willing to permit the respective Oil Companies to operate,.or as dividing the sea bed, including the portion outside territorial waters, between Bahrain and Qatar, and allotting to each Ruler virtual sovereignty over his respective portion without prejudice to existing navigation rights. In the latter case the application of the principles of President Truman’s Proclamation regarding the Continental Shelf is involved; you will be aware that this matter is at present under.consideration by H.h.G. Whatever the outcome, the first step must in any case be to obtain the recommendations of the Political Agent as to the most equitable dividing line. The Political Agent should perhaps base his recommendation primarily on the configuration of the main Bahrein Island, the Hawar Islands and the Qatar peninsula, with their respective territorial waters, and should so far as possible discount the recent assertions by the Bahrein Government of claims to reefs and rocks by the erection of cairns. He should, in fact, attempt to arrive at as simple and equitable a division of the sea-bed as possible. 5. If you see no objection, I should be glad if you would give instructions accordingly. F.

Dear Harrisor^, I j 4 p | Thanks for your 2nd Ju ly with enclosures on the subject of the Bahrein Petroleum Company’s proposals to resume operations in the Bahrein Additional Area, including the Hawar Islands and certain other areas adjacent to the Qatar coast. ^ So far as we are aware the territorial extent of the Bahrein Additional Area has not been delineated and there is no formal fecord on a map to show what was covered by the expansion of the BAPCO concession which took place in October 1939. Furthermore, so far as we know, the precise area covered by 'the Hawar Islands', .which H.K.G. decided in October 1939 belonged to the State of Bahrein rather than to Qatar, has also not been defined on a map. If the foregoing is correct, we suggest that we might go rather further than is at present suggested in requiring BAPCO to hold off develop ment pending settlement of the ^Bahreirv^Qatar boundaries. We should see no objection to BAPCO being allowed to develop their operations at points A, B, C, and D on the map enclosed with your letter, i.e. those lying northwards from the main Bahrein Island. We also agree that they should not, for the present, be allowed to develop at points E and P on their map (jaradeh and Jabal Croup). In the case of the Hawar Islands Neighbourhood, we should.certainly be averse to / letting BAPCO go to work at point J (Sowad Janubiya) until a territorial position is defined. This consideration we feel also really applies to the Hawar Islands themselves. Point H, for instance, on BAPCO’s map lying at the southern /end■Mm l,. ivtfl Ov^^f’ ^ ^ ^JU* J&amp; ii^rX ^ ^ . end of the main Hawar Island, appears to be within abo/ three miles of the coast of Qatar and the. territorial ws^ers of the island must overlap those of the Qatar mainlaind* We should, therefore, prefer to see BAPCO's operations deferred on Hawar until a 'frontier' has been defined between their concession on the island and that of P.C.L. in Qatar, including, presumably, its territorial waters, whatever they may be, , 3 On the face- of it, it would appear that a frontier ring should be put round the Hawar Islands,when these are appropriately defined, and that a frontier line should then be drawn due north from the Hawar Islands which would leave Jabal and Jaradeh ( points E &amp; P on the BAPC 6 map) in Qatar territory. There has, however, as you know, been talk in company circles of a possible quid pro quo arrange ment whereby 3APC0 would be prepared to give up the Hawar Islands (in which we understand P,G,L* are fairly interested) in exchange for some eastward extension of the territorial waters of Bahrein Island, If this kind of consideration is to be taken into account, however, it would mean re opening the 1939 decision on the Hawar Islands which I gather you are not prepared to do, .* &amp; . It is perhaps relevant to this problem of dividing thb enclosed waters between Bahrein and Qater to mention the Red Line Agreement, Y/ithout.going into detail this has the effect that the Iraq Petroleum Company and its P.C,L, subsidiaries would have to obtain the sanction of its component groups before it could v/ork an oil concession outside the Red Line area which, for this purpose, may be defined as the mainland and territorial waters of the Arabian Peninsula, excluding Kuweit.

My dear Donaldson, You will remember a visit which Wheatley and myself paid to you on 17th June, We spoke, among other things, about the water which passes between Hawar Island (allotted to Bapco) and the mainland of Qatar, which is ours. Our fear was that Qatar, and therefore ourselves, might not receive its due share of the territorial waters between the two zones. It so happens that our Bahrain manager has written a letter on this very point. I attach a copy of it. Our hope is that the Qatar/Haw&amp;r water question may be favourably settled before Bapco start drilling. We should associate ourselves with the hope Mr. Packer expresses in para. 4 of his letter. In more general terms, the following is our position and aspirations in the matter of the Bahrain-Hawar-Qatar seas In I938/3S there was a desire on the part of P.C.L., and also of Bapco, to obtain a concessionary grant from the Shaikh of Bahrain for the ’’unallotted areas' of the Bahrain ^haikhdom - i.e. areas not allotted to Bapco in 1934. The actual islands, reefs and waters included in such unallotted areas were somewhat indefinite; nor were the proper limits of the Shaikh of Bahrain and the Shaikh of Qatar properly established, although the assignment of Hawar islands to Bahrain, under India Office instructioas^-nxl&amp;ared up what had been a disputed point.2 - P.C.L. made a number of offers to the Shaikh of Bahrain for the unallotted areas, accompanying these with various alternative maps. In the end, however, P.C.L, offers were not accepted and the unallotted area was given to Bapco, P.C.L. remain ignorant of the limits of this supplementary Eapco concession, although realising that it includes the Hawar Island or Islands. P.C.L. claim, however, that their own Qatar Concession, granted with full India Office approval some years before the Bapco supplementary concession, cannot be invalidated by the latter. Therefore, whatever waters, reefs and islands were properly to be considered as Qatar possessions in May, 1935, are still held by P.C.L. Moreover, it seems to require scrutiny to ensure that no areas have been included in the supplementary area granted to Bapco in 1939 which ought more properly to have been considered as Qatar possessions and therefore omitted from the Bapco line. In cases where islands or reefs properly belong respectively to the two Shaikhs, presumably the boundary line should run half way between the two. I have communicated the above to Stock who, a day or two ago, consulted us on the matter. Yours sincerely E.P.

CONFIDENTIAL No. QSA.2/4333 ■ 1 9 *1 4 Dear Mr. Skliros, 46 ; I have heard from a reliable source that BAPCO have applied to His Majesty*s Government for the lifting of the restriction on drilling in the additional area of Bahrain, which includes Hawar and the waters, reefs, islets, etc. You may remember that this restriction was imposed during the war as a result, it is believed, of representations made by us here to the Political Agent pointing out that a notification by BAPCO of their intention to drill on Hawar was inappropriate in that drilling operations on the adjoining mainland of Qatar had been suspended, and the Ruler of Qatar would have strong justification for complaint against such a situation. 3* This commencement of drilling may very conceivably raise the question of the ownership of the waters and reefs etc., between the Qatar Peninsula and Bahrain outside their respective territorial waters. 4. Presumably the Political Agent will ensure that Qatar is given an opportunity of putting forward her claims. 5. * As explained in previous reports the Bahrain Government have, it is believe^ staked their claims wherever sufficient rock protrudes above high water mark to support a cemented cairn.

To - . political Resident, Persian Gulf, (Camp) Bahrain. No.c/528. Dated the 23rd of May, 1946. I enclose a copy of a letter from the chief Local Representative of the Bahrain petroleum Company together with a photographic map showing the Additional Area. 2. My comments are:- (1) The moratorium was agreed upon at the request * of the company, and as now war conditions do not prevail I presume His Majesty^ Government will have no objection to its termination as soon as BAPCO inform me that they are in a position to resume operations. (2) The locations. These can conveniently be divided into four groups: (x) the Jarim and Portuguese Fore group, (y) Jaradeh and Jabal group, (z) Hawar, and (j) Sowad Janubiya. (i) As regards (x). This Is not in dispute and is definitely situated in the Additional Area. Drilling Kc - , t „ j:jr, was once undertaken on Fasht Jarim - vide Residency telegram , 3 /eNo.180 dated the 16th October, 1941. A rig at the portu- *' guese Fort would be unsightly but is, I think, unobjection- , v 3o J able under the terms of the lease, and does not come within : the scope of Article 10 of the Further Deed of Modification. I suggest I reply to the Bahrain petroleum company that there is no objection to further operations in this group on the expiry of the moratorium. (ii) As regards (y). It appears that the ownership of the ifasht* has not been finally decided and Residency’s views appear to rest with Sir Geoffrey ^ / /; Prior’s despatch No.c/466 dated the 26th October, 1941, in ^ the last paragraph of which ha said that he thought the dividing line should run mid-way between the two main „ j , s islands up to the latitude of Hawar. It will be seen from this Agency letter No.C/599-1.a/29 dated the 20th July, 1940, that BAPCO have actually drilled on Jabal, but it appears for water and not for oil, and that they employed a contractor rather than undertaking operations themselves. I It will be seen that potable water was found which cannot I but be of interest to petroleum concessions Limited. I can | trace no record of BAPCO’s having been permitted to drill on area (y) and until a final decision regarding ownership is reached I think that BAPCO should not be allowed to commence operations. The value of the ’fasht’ to p.c.L. would be of interest but not necessarily bearing on rights of ownership. (iii) As regards (z). The propriety of the decision regarding the ownership of Hawar was raised by Sir Geoffrey prior and the Government of India’s view was that the year 1941 was inopportune for attempting to re-adjudicate ivo'w Ui-W-v - vide enclosure to Government of India, External Affairs *^'Ai - XK ' ^ Department letter No. D.5262-N/41 dated the 19th of November, 1941. Later correspondence rests with your endorsement ^ No.783-8 dated the 13th of October, 1944, and I do not know , , . ; what answer was conveyed to Mr. Wheatley. I presume that .. the question of ownership is not to be re-raised, in which /case.........- 2 - h'o .'race in k'fl' }&gt;eal'. \ case BAPCO should be at liberty to drill on the expiry of the moratorium, (iv) As regards (j). correspondence rests with Residency Memorandum No.C/469 dated the 26th of . October, 1941, in which it was stated that Sowad Janu- biya lies within a debatable area and drilling should not be undertaken there. Since that time circumstances have not changed and I suggest that I am authorised to iniorm the Bahrain petroleum Company that pending a decision of the limit of the Additional Area in that region they should not coramence operations. 3* I suggest that I should proceed to examine the rights of both Bahrain and Qatar to areas (y) and (j) and make recommendations.

The company anticipate that in the near future they will have the necessary personnel and equipment and be in a position to resume the exploration work within the Additional Area which was interrupted by the war. in view of the conditions under which this work was interrupted, a formal moratorium in respect of the company's obligations under Article 5 of the Deed of Further Modification dated 19th June, 1940, was granted for the period from 1st December, 1942, until such time as normal Company operations can be resumed. I will inform you immediately the Company are in a position to resume this work. Plans for this work are now being formulated and to expedite this preliminary work the Company will appreciate your requesting Government approval of the locations for future structure drilling opera tions, shown on the attached map and lettered^alpha betically from A to j. Locations B, C &amp; D, are not yet firm but they indicate the area in which the final choice will be made. These locations will be drilled from masonry piers in shallow water and will be no hazard to shippins Locations E &amp; F are situated In deeper water and will be drilled from steel pile structures which will be removed on completion of the work. Two of the locations on Hawar Island, Locations G &amp; H, have been approved before but approval for the location on Soward Janubiya (Location J) was deferred pending settlement of political negotiations under-way at that time (See le-tter No.c/1019-10/14 dated 30th October, 1941, from H.B.M.'s political Agent), This location is of importance in solving any structural anomaly which may be present in that area and we are particularly anxious t6 drill the structure hole as Indicated.Office of the Political Resident, Persian Gulf, 1 Camp, Bahrain, xvo.

Recoveries will only be mace in years when oil royalties exceed three lacs. Our managing Director adds that his agreement is subject to there being no objection from the folitical Agent.' (a) with regard to the loan itself the terms 3. seem generous. (b) With regard to the political aspect, the point occurs to me whether we should permit the Bhaikh of Qatar to make whatever use he likes of the loan, or advise him that a certain sum should be'utilized for btate improvements in education, medical facilities etc. Something will, I think, soon have to be done in 4. connection with such, faciltiies, but i am of the opinion that now, for one reasoiR because of the postponement in drilling necessitated py the war, we need make no reference to the Bhaikh ano. may inform P.C.L. that there is no political objection to the loan. 5 .

Your Excellency will remember that in the Political Agent’s letter No. C/924 of 1942 of 28th June 1942 you were informed that 'as a result of the war His Majesty's Government have found it necessary to direct the Oil Company to suspend its operations in your territory.' The conditions of the suspension were the subject of an agreement between Your Excellency and the Political Agent dated 28th Dul Qadah 1362 (26th November 1943) . - L he reason neighbouring Companies were permitted to continue their work was that at the outbreak of war they already were producing petrol and kerosene ready for use for war purposes. Your Excellency will understand that the Com.any having spent very large sums of money in Qatar so far without any return for t is expenditure, is just as anxious as Your Excellency to produce oil and thus get money. The Company could not resume operations without the agreement of the Government. 3» Two days ago we received a letter from our Managing Director, London, instructing us to inform Your Excellency that the Company has been authorised to reopen Qatar operations. The first stage, commencing early in 1946, will be the preparation of the Dukhan Camp for the drilling programme. Mr Dickson and our Assistant Manager, Haifa, have already visited Dukhan to ascertain what is2 . necess-ry. #e will give your Excellency at least two month's notice of the re-opening of the Camp. The actual drilling, it is hoped, will commence towards the end of 1946. The extent of the drilling programme depends cn the supply of drilling machinery, other necessary equipment and qualified ■ personnel. Our Managing Director realises the importance -i.oup Excellency attaches to the early development of the Qatar oil field and has promised to keep us all informed if ■ the situation improves and the work can he expedited or expanded. to the question of an ddvance of money X\ -• T * 'v..a “ .y “ Li5 ■ ML the arrangement made at my last visit to Your Excellency was that we should wait for the arrival of the Managing Director or his personal representative and put the matter to him verbally. We discussed the reasons for this procedure. Unfortunately the long promised visit has not materialised although expected as soon as the hot weather is over. If Your Excellency wishes to change the plan and ’ would like a letter to be written this can be done immediately. Your Excellency will understand that the Company is expected to keep the Political Agent informed on all matters affecting tne terms of our oil concessions and applications for advances in respect of oil royalties would come under this category, vve shall await comirmation from Your Excellency before writing any letters.

Of particular importance in the file is the issue of the division of the sea bed for drilling operations between PCL's concession, and that of the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited (BAPCO) in Bahrain.The file contains discussion of the issue by the India Office, the Foreign Office, the Ministry of Fuel and Power, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and the Political Agent, Bahrain.The papers cover: the resumption of drilling operations in Qatar after their suspension during the Second World War; payment of royalties; the Hawar Islands; the granting of permission to use wireless sets; the response of British officials to a United States Government request to PCL for information on petroleum resources in Qatar and the Trucial Coast, October-November 1946; aerial surveys of the Bahrain-Qatar Unallotted Area; the application of US President Harry S Truman's continental shelf doctrine to the issue (e.g. folios 141, 110); maps of the area; Admiralty comments on the need for all parties to be aware that the sea bed only was concerned, and that the waters above, and free navigation, were in no way affected (folio 46); correspondence from the oil companies involved; and the reactions of local rulers to the negotiations.The file also contains five maps.The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year.
