It also contains an incomplete copy (on folios 2-7) of the
                           Kuwait Air Navigation Regulation, 1949and a copy (on folio 8) of a notice, dated 22 May 1936, for the introduction of the superseded 1936 regulation.The file is mostly made up of telegrams, and the odd letter, between the Kuwait Political Agent (Herbert George Jakins), the Persian Gulf Political Resident (William Rupert Hay), and the Foreign Office. The creation date range covers the main run of this correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Kuwait Air Navigation Regulation</topic></subject><subject><topic>Judicial appointments</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000159#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
