In 1935, with funds almost exhausted, the correspondence discusses whether the allowance should be continued in order to continue to provide relief to five destitute British Indian women. Also discussed is the possibility of the women being repatriated to India.The file features the following correspondents: His Majesty's Consul, Damascus (Gilbert MacKereth); the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India; officials of the Foreign Office and India Office.In addition to correspondence the file includes a statement of disbursements for the period of 1926-1934.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence (folio 1).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Consul</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Poor relief</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Foreign Secretary</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Consulate, Damascus</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Syria</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x0002a7#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
