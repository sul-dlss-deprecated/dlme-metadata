In order that the Residency Agent should not be handicapped,I have sent you what stationery we can spare (list enclosed) for onward transmission to Sharjah. 3. If obtainable locally, would you please buy the following by debit to this Residency and send them to Sharj ah*- I should be grateful if you would supply if available, or by purchase. the necessity for the strictest economy in stationery, espe cially in the use of paper? For office copies, I am sending him draft forms (S-5) as no other paper can now be spared for this purpose. The reverse side may be used. He should also be asked to open up envelopes carefully with a view to their being used again by pasting a slip over the portion bearing an address. 6. The balance of his indent will be ‘reviewed on receipt of our stationery. 7. Would you please instruct the Residency Agent to send in an annual indent through you, giving the actual quantity used during the two preceding years, as I am not certain whether the present indent is for the current year or not. 8. I suggest for your consideration whether it would not facilitate matters if you supplied tiie Residency Agent from your stock? If you concur, I will take the matter up with the Controller of Stationery with a view to your allotment being increased. Typewriting paper Blotting paper Pins Sealing wax.

The Industries and Civil Supplies Department desires that with effect from 1945-46 Government Departments and offices should not buy imported paper In any appreciable cuantlties the o en market. All substantial requirements should be specially provisioned for by Government as x In the case of Indigenous paper. Local purchase of Imported paper upto the limit of Rs. 100/- a yenr will be permissible. ♦ 2. It is possible that the Home Department etc. and offices attached and subordinate to them have been accustomed to make large direct purchase of certain special varieties of Imported paper from the market. This cuts across the policy being introduced by the Industries and Civil Supplies Department• 3. To avoid difficulty in future procurement it Is necessary n^w to provision for such paper* The Central Stationery Of fice has been able to prepare an estimate of the g aper requirements of imported paper of the various Civil apartments and Offices on the basis of past cmsuMption and supplies. This estimate cannot cov r quantities hitherto purchased direct, i.e., not through the Central Stationery Office. An estimate of such direct purchases if any, during the next financial year by the Home Department etc. and t heir attached and subord inat e off ices may kindly be compiled and furnished to this office by the 23rd December 1M4. in the attached form to eftable us to make suitable provision for the same in the total Imported paper requirements for 1945-46. 4. If no reply is received by the 2Srd Decrmber1944 it will be presumed that no direct purchases of imported paper are made by the Home Department etc. and offices attached and subordinate to them and that no additional provision is necessary on thit account.

Our Stationery indent'including; all types of papers e.g. Foolcap ruled, typewriting paper, duplicating. , paper, carbon papers, stencil papers etc.' are indented annually , ; and supplied by» the Central Stationery Office, Calcutta. In case our•supply of papers runs short we take some papers Qn loan from bushire( vide p.115 in File ho. 15/l) So there is hardly any occasion for us to purchase regularly every year any kind of paper from tne open market. Our requirements'must hatve been .included py the Central- Stationery office ,Calcutta in their estimate, as stated in the Controller 1 s memo', (please see gpara 3 thereof). May inform Foreign, New Delhi, that kfeg except the papers indented . through the Central Stationery Office,' Calcutta, this Agency does not make any.regular purchase of imported papers direct from the x* . open market.
