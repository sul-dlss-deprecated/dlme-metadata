New Delhi Kay 11-* An Indo-Iranian Association has been formed in Delhi for the purpose of furthering.cultural relations between India and Iran. The association also intends to promote the interchange of students and teachers; create better understanding and knowledge between the two countries by exhibitions,, filmshows and lectures; t6 arrange for the interchange of visits in tin field of sports and athletics.anc coordinate facilities for tru, exchange* of books and manuscripts, etc. (Bureau)%© One result of the Persian Cultural Mission’s tour in March-April, 1944, was a desire to broaden and strengthen India’s contacts with Persia, particularly in the sphere of cultural relations. In furtherance of this aim, the Grovernment of India have . granted in all 17 scholarships to Persian students - 6 at the Aitchison College, Lahore; 4 at the Agricultural College, Lyallpur; 2 at the Indian Forest College, Dehra Dun; and 5 at the Delhi Polytechnic, 3 in Engineering and 2 in Textiles. The scholarships at the Aitchison College have not yet been accepted, owing to difficulties attaching, to boys of school-going age leaving Persia to attend the College. Ihe remaining 11 scholar ships have however been accepted and all but one of the students — a candidate for the Delhi Polytechnic who is expected later — have arrived in India. It is hoped that it will eventually prove possible to make reciprocal arrangements for Indian students to study in Persia. CHS/BLV ”230 — 11.7.46”^4 A PRE SS COMMUNIQUE 1 / 7^^ A stimulating suggestion mare by His Excellency .Agha ^ Hikrnat, Leader of the Iranian Cultural Mission which toured India last spring,, was the constitution of two Standing Committees, one in Tehran and the other in Delhi, to give effect to ideas which were put forward by the Mission and to consider further proposals for drawing closer the cultural ties between Iran and India and generally to bring two great traditions into even greater harmony. An Indo-Iranian Cultural Society has already been set .up in Tehran and a body designated the*Indo-Ifanian ^tending Committee has now been formed in Delhi with the FonVble Sir Jogendra Singh, Member in Charge of the Education, Health and Lands Department, as Chairman and eleven other members among vAiom are Agha Ali Motamedy, Consul-General for Iran in India, the Right Hon'ble Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru, Dr. Panna La'll, Professor Kadi Hassan of the Aligarh University, Dr. Zakir Hussain, Principal of the Jamia Millia Islamia, and Professor I.H. Qureshi of the Delhi University, as well as officials concerned with Indo-Iranian affairs. The inaugural meeting of the Delhi Committee took place in New Delhi on the 22nd January 1945. After the President and the Consul-General’for Iran had welcomed the members various proposals were considered for promoting closer cultural relations between Ir^n and India, and a Sub-Committee was appointed to study proposals for the formation of an Indo-Iranian Cultural Society, v/hich was envisaged as a learned body with a wide membe rship designed to foster academic activities as well as sherries for the exchange of students and professors between the two countries as well as to encourage the study of modern Persian in Indian universities. The following schemes, already undertaken or under consideration, were reported: the offer of scholarships to Iranian students in Indian technical and other educational BLS/SRV •..institutions' ■ . institutions: propospJs for mutual assistance in archaeology } and co-operation between libraries - and the very special need to establish in India schools of learning in modern Persian to supplement the study of the classical language. .The Committee notbd with satisfaction the inauguration of an Indo-Iranian Cultural Society in Calcutta, and the many evidences to be found in Bombay, Delhi, Hyderabad and other centres of the genuine *nd- spontaneous enthusiasm in India for the traditions of Persian culture and civilisation. The Committee’s efforts will be devoted to the stimulation and co-ordination of all these activities, to the end that modern Ir°n and modern India, conscious of their great common heritage in the past, may enrich the future through an exchange of ideas and aspirations.

OU' J ^ j ^ I Jj » \ 4745 Wherever we went we were given a warm welcome and were assured of the fullest sympathies of the authorities of the Universities and other institutions for our schemes for the exchange of students and professors between the Indian Universities and our own University of Tehran and for developing a new relationship by such means as correspondence and the exchange of literature, art-exhibits, etc. “ Just at a time when the world is passing through the horrors of war and the very foundation of organised society, of culture and civilization, seems to be shaking, it may seem a little incongruous to talk of culture and cultural missions. But as the old Persian saying goes : “ Blessed are those that look ahead.” With the help of God the final victory will undoubtedly be ours, and a new world of peace and security will be built on the ruins of the war. Both India and Iran as the inheritors of the two most ancient civilizations and cultures will have an important part to play in the post war world. Both of them have much to learn from each other.

We have fcjeen, so to say, eye-witnesses to the excel- lerrt morale of our Indian cousins. It was in the course of our tour that we received the news that Japan had ventured to cross the Burma frontier into Assam, yet every where that we went we found a sense of confidence under-lying all civil and military activities.” Continuing, the Leader of the Mission said : “ Ours is the first Cultural Mission that has come to India and will, we hope, be the prelude to many such contacts. We are sincerely grateful to the Government of India for making it possible for us to study the educational and cultural conditions of this country at first hand. We are also grateful for this to our own Government who under the inspiring leadership of His Majesty the Shah is playing its full part in contributing to the final victory of the United Nations of which Iran too is a proud member. Brief as our stay in this country has been we have learnt many things and made many contacts which we hope will prove of the highest value in furthering the object of our Mission, namely that the two great and ancient nations of the East—India and Iran—which have sprung from a common stock, and have a common cultural heritage, should renew and revitalize their centuries-old ties and, as in the past, make yet another lasting contribution to civili zation and humanity after the war. ^ ^@ 1 — *r. ^ ?. ^ wL? ^ g 1 ^ ^ j ^ j [S 'iI ^ (Jj b «.}!y£iGi oVUI j J* b C- I t Ijj I # !«AjI ^ -9 &gt; Gv! *^ Ij I Ij ^ ^ ^■*.**' 1a 1 Ij *x.y4Mj j j ^ ^j ^ l!

Her sons always had wide knowledge of the sciences, philosophy, mathematics and astronomy. Their relics of the Ahcemenid days, which have not been ravaged by time, portray their skill in architecture. The Sassanid dynasty, which followed the Achaemenid, is recognised as a period of learning and culture which shed rays not only on Persia but also on the world. Darmstetter, the distinguished Orientalist, speaks of this period thus : “ The Sassanid era has a historic importance not only applicable to Persia itself. Its significance pertains to the general history of the entire human race. At no period of history has the influence of morals and ideals been so great in East and West as at that period. Persia, as the pivot of the whole ancient world, was considered the focal centre of this movement.”39 time of Akbar the Great up to the close of the Moghal period in India the rights and claims of the neighbouring states were carefully guarded by both the peoples , and it was during that age that these relations spread even to the Southern part of India. It was in that period too that a large member of scholars and poets came to India from Iran. \\ Idle they regaled us with the fruits of their learning and wisdom, they also brought to this land Iranian civili zation and culture, the traces of which can be seen in our fine arts and literature, and even in our dress and food. Many of the Indian languages absorbed the phraseology of the Persian language to such an extent that Persian has become an inseparable part of them. I his is particularly true of the Hindustani language known as “ Urdu , the rise and development of which can in so many ways be traced to Persian. Permit us, Sirs, to state that we have devoted ourselves to our best capacity to the study and service of Persian language and literature. We have not only honoured in a behtting manner the poets and literary men that visited India, but we have ourselves acquired the language of Persia, and have produced poets and scholars who have received recognition even in Iran. As Persian was the language of the court and the government offices during the Muslim period, with the passage of time it acquired so much importance that not only did the Muslims of this country use it in their literary works, but the non- Muslims also employed it for diverse purposes. In fact the non-Muslims have had a consi derable share in the Persian literature produced in India. If on the one hand we can point out among the Indian writers such persons as Rabi'a Qusdariyya, Abul-Faraj Runi, Masud Sa‘d Salman, Abu Abdullah Ruzbih Nukti, Amir Khusraw, Hasan Dihlawi, Azad Bilgrami, Thabit Allahabadi, Abdur-Rashid Thattawi, Khan-i-Arzu, Abdul-Wasey Hansawi, and Ghalib Dihlawi; and also Iqbal Lahawri (who made Persian the vehicle of his thought) ; on the other hand such savants and lexicographers as Anand Ram Mukhlis, Siyalkoti Mai Warusta, Tek Chand Bahar, Chandrabhan Brahman and Madho Ram also deserve special and honourable mention. After the Moghal Empire Persian continued, side by side with English, to be the language of the various departments of the Government. But after that the Hindustani language gradually took its place. Though Persian lost its lofty position, yet owing to its innate beauty and sweetness it still allures the people—the Muslims more than others—to engage in its study. This is why Persian is still included in the courses of study for high schools, colleges and universities, and the number of its students is still considerable. In conclusion we express our hearty sense of gratification at your visit, and we fervently trust that through your noble efforts and influence the cultural bonds between India and Iran will be strengthened ! The time for a wish has arrived ; let us, therefore, be brief: May the world accord to your wishes ! May you enjoy eternal bliss ! We Are Respectfully yours Members of the Allahabad University Oriental Society {Arabic and Persian). 22nd Rabi I, 1363. 17th March, 1944.- - -» - — 38 AN ADDRESS The Honoured Members of the Iranian Delegation From ^ The Members of the Oriental Society (Arabic and Persian), ^ Allahabad University. Sirs, We the members of the Oriental Society of the Allahabad University, have gathered here with feelings of extreme pride and pleasure. We offer our sincere and respectful wel come to you, and feel elated with feelings of our good fortune at having been honoured by having this occasion of meeting you. O envoys of Iran, you have brought lustre to our assembly here , And have endowed our dwelling with the brilliance of the sunrise ! Sirs, This city of Allahabad, which is now enjoying the honour of welcoming you, is one of the most ancient and holy cities of India. The confluence here of the three streams, Ganges Tamna and Saraswati, has made it the meeting place of all Indians ; and this has been so since most ancient times. This place has invariably been the centre of the religion and learning of India. It is a happy coincidence that almost the very place where we are assembled at this moment had an important college and library in the time of Buddha the prophet of India and it was a centre of light and learning. Then, during the Muslim period, this city continued to have a great political and literary importance, as is evidenced by the Port of Akbar which stands to this day at the confluence of the Ganges and the Jamna to revive memories of those glorious days, and by the buildings of the Khusrow Bagh, as also by the numerous circles of the learned and the sufis, the traces of most of which are still to be found. \\ e are thankful that even at the present age those heavy traditions are carried on. Apart from being the Capital of the Government of the United Provinces, this city of Allahabad possesses one o the most renowned universities of the country, hor a period that now exceeds half a century it has been rendering remarkable service by disseminating knowledge of arts and sciences, and not only this Province, but the whole of India benefits by its services. Many products of this University have made a mark, and their fame has spread far and wide. Some of these honourable names are those of Pandit Moti Lai Nehru, Sir Shah Mohammad Sulaiman, and Sir Ganganath Jha, who accomplished great tasks before leaving this world, and I andit Madan Mohan Malviya, Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru and Sir Iqbal Ahmad, who are still with us Now, that for about a quarter of a century this University has been of a residental type, it has acquired even greater importance, and with a larger number of departments of studies in law, commerce, arts and sciences the University is acquiring even greater brilliance under the fostering care of its head, Dr. Amaranatha Jha, May the evil eye be averted from it . Sirs, The contacts between Iran and India date from the time our Aryan ancestors emigrated from Aryavaij to this land. That is why there is so much similarity between the languages and manners of the two peoples. After the appearance of Islam, particularly during the Ghaznawid times, our mutual relations received a fresh impetus, so that the two countries came still nearer to each other. During the Khilji and Tughluq period a number of the literati and nobles came down to India. Thereafter too, during the times of the . afawids and the Moghals this friendship was strengthened. Humayun resorted to Iran, and it was with the help of the King of Iran that he could regain his throne in India. Then from theI he Mission at Khnsro’s Tomb, Allahabad. To-day, thanks to the goodwill and initiative of the Government of India and the icady response of the Iranian Government, we have travelled to this country with the object of renewing and re-establishing our old ties. We see that the barriers to our unity and brotherhood can easily be removed. One of these is the comparatively long distance, the territorial separation of one country from the other. Yet if our forefathers could maintain ties in the days of difficult travelling surely in these days of easy travel we can do likewise, he other barrier is the question of accent and dialect. The learned men of India are still ascinated by the words of Sa’di, Hafiz, Maulvi and other writers and poets of Iran. This ove for poetry was manifested nowhere better than last night at the residence of our esteemed nend, Sir fej Bahadur Sapru, who has great love for and appreciation of Persian literature. hue the works of our poets and writers are taught in schools, the lack of practice in con versational Persian and geographical factors have made fluent conversation difficult. But this too can be removed through closer association. It is to the learned men of our two countries that we look for the strengthening of the ties leading once again to the mutual benefit of the centres of learning in India and in Iran. In conclusion I thank the Members of the Oriental Society of Allahabad University w o uive fascinated us with their kind and sweet words. May these ties of friendship between us be so strengthened as to resist the onslaughts of time and circumstances ! May the edifice of our friendship stand firm and erect as the mighty Alburz and the Himalayas ! 3736 As we know, the Aryans of India spread their creed and the names of their Gods to the Near East by way of Iran; Mithraism or Sun worship went as far as Rome. Even more convincing is the testimony of the Bughaz Keui inscription in Turkey containing the names of the many common Iranian and Indian Gods. The legends of Avesta and the religious books of ancient India, the most well-known of which is the Righveda, contain many common names of kings and heroes some of whom were held in great esteem by both the peoples and even deified. Of these we can name Jamshid of Iran which is the Yama of Imtfa, Faridun, Tahmoores and others. In our more recent historical books, such as the “ Shahnamah ” of Firdausi, the “ Tarikh Saalabi ”, and ” Garshaspnamah ” of Asadi, ” Tarikh Tabari ”, ‘‘Muruj-az- Zahab”, of Masoodi,etc., there are numerous accounts of the travels of Iranian Kings to India and the exchange of gifts and of rare articles as also of men of letters and science. The Ashkanian (Parthian) kings of Iran through the remnants of the Bactrian Kingdom facilitated the diffusion of Buddhism in Eastern Iran. During the time of the Sassanian Dynasty these close relations were maintained. Indeed in the reign of Shahpur I (3rd century A.D.) many scientific books of India were rendered into Pahlavi and were incorporated in the Avesta which thus became a veritable encyclopaedia of religious and scientific knowledge. The account of Behramgor and Shangal (4th Century A.D.) King of India, the former’s incognito travels in India and his marriage with the daughter of Shangal, the migration of twelve thousand Indian artists and musicians to Iran, who were known as ' Lillians ”, Nausherwan’s discourses with the learned men of India are also described in the Shahnamah. Burzuyah’s journey to India to bring the Sanskrit books, particularly” Keilila Damna ” which the Vice-Chancellor has so eloquently described, as well as the introduction into Iran from India of the game of Chess as a test of intelligence, the secret of which was discovered by Buzorg Mehr, the legendary philosopher and Minister, and his sending the game of dice ” nard ” to India—all go to show the relations existing between the two countries in the realm of science and knowledge. The Sassanian Kingdom was for a long time a strong barrier protecting the North- Western frontiers of India ; following the decline of its power in Afghanistan and Turkistan, the Huns invaded India and ransacked the country as far as Bengal. These close contacts between Iran and India did not cease during the Islamic era. Indeed the two peoples enthusiastically maintained them. The people of India easily accepted the customs and the language of Iran and during the reign of the “ Ghaznavids ”, Khalaj, Toklogh-Shah and other Muslim Dynasties, Persian words found ready acceptance in India. This clearly indicates that the aptitude was there before the Ghaznavid without which this ready acceptance would have been most unlikely. Thereafter a generation of poets, such as Maswood-Saad Salman and others wrote their verses in both languages. The most comprehensive book on Indian knowledge known as ” Ma-lil-Hind ” was written by the great Iranian Abu-Reihan Al-Biruni. The relations between Iran and India during the 'Safavi ” Dynasty are too well known to need mention ; indeed at this time the two countries were considered as one. Unfortunately for a time the histories of both countries fell into neglect and oblivion and, as it were, the two brothers got separated from each other.% .iUfjJi J cJua l j ^ ^ 1 j ! 4JI ^ ^ ^ j ^ ^ **—**^5^ j ^ J « J^J Lw ^ 4 V » (^^*1 _J ol$^*J I ^ (J^^j ^ ^ * ‘3 J ^ Speech delivered by Mr. Hekmat in Allahabad University March 17th, 1944. Mr. Vice-Chancellor and Gentlemen, First of all I should like to thank the Vice-Chancellor and the Members of the Oriental Society of the Allahabad University for organising this function. As Doctor Siddiqi pointed out our two peoples have enjoyed close relations since pre-historic days. After the migration of the great Aryan race from its place of origin and its division into two branches, one great branch of our ancestors chose India for its home. It is only natural that the ties of culture and the bonds of common origin were stronger in the early days than the mere geographical contiguity of to-day. It was also equally natural that the closest cultural and linguistic affinity should have existed between Iran and India. 35ALIGARH UNIVERSITY Aligarh University is the only Muslim University in India and a centre of Islamic culture. This great institution was founded in 1875. At that time Indian Muslims were trying to preserve their culture from Westernisation ; very few had studied English or taken up modern studies. In consequence their position in the country was deteriorating, for English was essential for Government service and the professions and they could only take subordinate places. But they found a leader in Sir Saiyid Ahmed Khan, who wanted his co-religionists ta^become modernised in their outlook while retaining their basic Islamic religion. He nQised that his aims could not be achieved through the Governmental educational institutions which were necessarily neutral in religion. He therefore founded a separate College, the Anglo-Muhammedan College at Aligarh. He believed that two things were necessary for his purpose : religious education and residential life. Religious teachers were appointed and all students had to take religious training. The residential system he regarded as important partly because it made possible the promotion of a truly Islamic way of life, and partly because through it more modern ways of living could be introduced without undermining religion. The residential system was modelled on that of English schools and colleges ; in fact the first three Principals were Englishmen brought out from England to build up the institution on English lines. There were common meals and a common social life. English games were encouraged, particularly cricket. The Debating Union became famous. A high standard of living was adopted, with Western methods of entertaining an eating. Western dress was not adopted, but the typical Indian Muslim dress evolved at Aligarh : the Turkish fez, the close-fitting coat or sherwani, the English shoe. Aligarh is now a fine institution with splendid buildings and playing fields. It became a University in 1920. From its gates there has poured out a stream of well-educated Muslims, able to take their place in modern life, but at the same time firmly grounded in their religion. 34 mIran and India are two countries that can rightly be pioud of theii great heiitage through both ancient and modern times, and throughout these long ages the noble sons of these noble lands cheerfully bore every difficulty and ceaselessly strove hard in the cause of knowledge. To-day we are going to revive those old traditions of our woithy ancestors. The time has come that just as the forces of evil and mischief are abusing the wonderfully improved means of transport and communication, scholars and students who lepresent the forces of peace and salvation should take the fullest advantage of these facilities toi the benefit of mankind, and the great scholars who are to-day treading the path of knowledge in Delhi, Aligarh, Lahore, Bombay, Lucknow, etc., should co-operate with their colleagues who engaged in the same task at Shiraz, Isfahan, Tehran, labriz and Meshed and they should all join forces to tear to pieces the shrouds of ignorance and folly, so that if the historians once and archaeologists of Iran discover anything new in their researches they should at once communicate the same to the historians and archaeologists in India and similarly if the chemists, physicians and biologists working in their laboratories or in the plains and jungles of India make a new discovery, they should inform their colleagues in Iran about it, so that by means of their close co-operation the health and happiness of the peoples of the two lands may be ensured. Similarly the books, newspapers, and magazines published in the two countries should be made to pass quickly amongst the readers in both countries leading thereby to ceaseless progress in the fields of agriculture and industry to the mutual benefit of both peoples. The time has come when distinctions of race and religion and differences of language need no more act as barriers amongst mankind ; when, in contradistinction to the foolish notions of Fascism and Nazism, based on the alleged superiority of race, all nations of the world should share on the same level the benefits of freedom and fraternity. If in the past, the nations of the orient have remained aloof from one another as a result of bigotry and there have been some differences in their old cultures, it is now time that with the help of better knowledge and culture, their differences should be removed and the wounds of misunderstanding thoroughly healed. In short, Iranians and Indians should both work together, brother-like, for the peace and salvation of mankind. This is the ideal with which we have come on this Mission and in the name of this true unity which can come about only with the spread of knowledge and culture, I pray to God for the safety and success of all those who have assembled here with that great object in mind. »'Q~)V.v? &lt; tj 1 , j j &lt;_)-*?li (J^-J j ^ - 1 ^ jt!

My Worthy Host, Ladies and Gentlemen, We are deeply indebted for all the kindness with which this function has been organised in honour of this Mission : it prompts me to express our hearty thanks once again for the warm reception that the Government of India has afforded us. As a matter of fact this kindness is not intended for only the few individuals who are now visiting your land but it really signifies the great love and deep affection that you cherish for Knowledge and Science, Literature and Culture. 30After studying medicine for three years, he went to Paris, where he stayed for two 7 years. Later he devoted himself to a study of ancient Persia. He was for some time in Bombay for research studies. Professor Uaoud was deputed by the Persian Government as a teacher to Shantiniketan. He is now a Professor of Avista language and Culture and takes the doctorate classes ; he is also a Professor of Ancient Law in the Faculty of Law. Professor Daoud, who is a member of the Persian Academy, is the author of several works including : Comments on the Ancient Avista in nine volumes ; Pourandokht (poetical works) ; Iranshah (a history of the migration of the Parsis into India) ; Khorramshah (an article on ancient Persian culture); Saoshiant (regarding the appearance of the Prophet of the Zardushtis) and Lessons in Persian Conversation for Indian Schoolboys. Professor Daoud is 56 years of age. s 2927 Professor Rashid Yasemi who comes from Kirmanshah is 47 years old and is a Member of the Academy of Iran. He has been a number of times to Europe, Egypt and Syria and is now Professor of History in the University of Tehran. He is also one of the leading modern poets and is the author of a Uewan. Among his works are :— 1. A History of the Sasanids. 2. A History of Iran. 3. A History of the Kurds. 4. Translation of Browne’s Literary History of Persia. 5. Research on the works of such renowned poets as :— Farzi-i-Seistani, Masood-i-Saad-i-Salman, Ibn-i-Yameen, Salman-i-Sawji.HIS EXCELLENCY ’ALI ASGHAR HEKMAT LEADER OF THE PERSIAN CULTURAL MISSION His Excellency ’Ali Asghar Hekmat, Leader of the Persian Cultural Mission, is a member of the Persian National Assembly and has been Minister of State, Minister of Education, Minister of Industry and Occupation, Minister of Justice and Minister of Health. As Minister of Education he rendered outstanding service to his country. Many of the splendid schools and college buildings, as well as the Tehran Museum and the 25 training colleges for teachers, owe their existence to him. His Excellency ’Ali Asghar was educated in Persian and Arabic at Shiraz and Tehran and obtained his degree of Master of Arts from Paris. He is at present a University Professor in the Faculty of Science and Culture and is also a member of the Persian Academy. His works include a Persian translation of Shakespeare, comments on the poetical works of Jami, and research on Nizami’s Laila Majnun. He is 51 years of age. 19mutual treaty of agreement and are associated in a noble cause. Let us wish and fervently pray that the hour of peace may not be delayed too long, and Iran, the age-old bridge between the east and the west, will be left stronger, more prosperous, free from want and fear of aggression. The newly laid double alignment of the railway system linking /ffiv. much enlarged ports of Bandar Aahpur on the Persian Gulf with Bandar Shah on the Caspian Sea and the network of motorable roads driven in all directions throughout the country, now used for transporting supplies and material for the successful operation of the war, will remain as a present and a token of goodwill and mark of appreciation from the United Nations. Materially strengthened by these improved com munications, Iran will in peace-time be destined to play a great and glorious part, developing her commerce, trade and economic prosperity, rehabilitating her administration and safeguarding her national security and also providing once again a link to bring her neighbour ing countries into the comradeship of her traditional culture.” Before bringing this to a close, I have great pleasure in quoting the observations made by Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru on the occasion of the Mission’s visit to Allahabad. Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru is one of India’s most outstanding men and a scholar who has been particularly interested in the study of the language and literature of Iran. j j' j j^ jLf'ji j j I j I «0f j c_5U».

The kinship is clearly established between Iran in the centre, England in the west and India in the east, not only by identity of ethnological characteristics, but also by a remarkable affinity in the language expressing the ^3 J L—c ^ (^3 j I ^ ^.1 0;^ jl j 5jU U Ij! ^ vUJ 1^.^) I ^ iI # l—-&lt;) **■**'J 2 ^ ^ l ^ l kX} ^ ^ Ui* ‘A'V* L5^ ^ « *A—I j ^ 3 ^1 &lt;c 5 ^ Brachycephalic Members of the Mis sion at the Osmania Medical College, Hyderabad. iCo i ^ (ildj -Cj&gt;. j %7 -yA ngs and grounds of the Aligarh Muslim University. and has taken a remarkable share in the development of civilization and culture. Some European scholars may not agree, but I hold that even the Greeks have not that continuity of civilization of thousands of years which the people of Iran enjoy. “ Arya, the fatherland of the Aryans, lay in Persia. From this centre of population Arts, Crafts and Languages have spread out in all directions. From here the Perso-Aryans migrated north west across the Ural Mountains in their journey through Europe to England. Eastwards the Indo-Aryans crossed the Hindu-Kush range and occupied northern India. We find the same racial and physical characteristics in the inhabi tants of these countries, with certain modifications due to climatic conditions : fair skin, regular features, prominent nose, large eyes which are not slanting, O-i J b J ^ &lt;3 iS' 5 O; b-i J V— — •i ob b-' ^ b ^ b jj I jl ojb -tjbi . -j G a.5^ -tjb I j ,^•,.,1 l_J ^ l-&amp;.a y JL. «ubl lj j ^&gt;^1 obo- ^jbjl j»ji 3W?'

The Mission toured India partly by plane but mainly by a special railway saloon placed at their disposal by the Government of India. In the various towns and cities they were the guests of the Governors of the British Indian Provinces and Indian Princes. They carry away with them and will always retain the most happy memories of their tour, studies, and observations in India. I, in my turn, feel it my duty to express on behalf of my Government, my heartfelt thanks and gratitude for the kind invitation of the Government of India and the cordial and warm reception extended everywhere to the Mission by all concerned. It is a matter of great rejoicing that the Government of India, as a tribute to the culture of Iran which held such a prominent position in world civilization and of which everlasting traces remain in both the Orient and the West, initiated the renewal and the re-establishment of cultural relations between the lands of India and Iran. There is little doubt that this step will very largely contribute to the consolidation of the bonds of friendship and fraternity between the two nations—nations that have, in the past, so generously and liberally contributed to each other’s culture and civilization. It is, in fact, a solid founda tion for the prosperity of the peoples of Iran and India and for the better understanding of the one by the other. Talking of Iranian Culture and its influence upon world civilization, I deem it to be of great interest to quote below a few passages of Sir Hassan Suhrawardy’s lecture on the subject delivered by him in London. Sir Hassan Suhrawardy, whom I have the honour to know personally, is one of India’s most distinguished statesmen and held the eminent office of Adviser to the Secretary of State for India in London for a number of years. He is also renowned for his academic achievements. “ Examination of all available data, fabulous, traditional and historical, confirms the claim that Iran, so long known in England as Persia, occupies a unique position in the history of mankind J J y* I J ^ J I G.

Yet it was regretted that, owing to war time strain on transport and accommo dation, no more than three members could be invited. The Mission were to visit the important educational centres and seats of learning in India, in a period of one month, during which time they would be the guests of the Government of India. The invitation was also conveyed to the Iranian Government through His Britannic Majesty’s Embassy in Tehran.

On March 8th, 1944 the Mission, flying from Karachi, arrived in Delhi and resided at Viceregal Lodge. During their three days’ stay in the Indian Metropolis, the members of the Mission were the guests of His Excellency Field Marshal Lord Waved, the Viceroy and Governor General of India. Later, over a period of three weeks, the Iranian Cultural Mission visited the Universities and educational centres and organizations in Lahore, Aligarh, Benares, Allahabad, Bombay, Hyderabad (Deccan), Bangalore and Madras. On April 2nd the Mission, on the comple tion of their tour, returned to Bombay whence, after a brief stay, they returned to Iran by boat.

This invitation, no doubt, is to serve as a prelude to further cultural associations, namely, the sending out of a Mission consisting of University Professors, the acceptance of the students of the one country by the other, etc., leading to the strengthening of the cultural ties between the two lands.

The cultural connections between Iran and India are very ancient, far more ancient even than the con nections between India and China. In the dawn of history Indians and Iranians were branches of one great family. In historic times also there have been close connections; for some centuries Persian was the court language of India, and Persian influence stamped itself deep on Indian literature, art and music. These contacts were largely lost when Persian ceased to be the language of the courts and of polite society in India and English took its place. India is now developing her international contacts, particularly with those countries with whom in the past she had cultural relations. She has already welcomed a number of Chinese Missions in recent years; now she is entertaining an Iranian Cultural Mission. Its members are three eminent men of letters and members of the Persian Academy. The leader, His Excellency Aga Ali Asgar Hikmat, is an educationist and experienced administrator. Pro fessor Ebrahim Poure Daoud is Professor of Ancient Law in Teheran University. He has visited India before, having been deputed by the Persian Govern ment as a teacher to Santiniketan. Professor Rashid Yasemi is a leading poet and historian. The Mission is visiting India’s leading cities and educational centres, and is everywhere receiving a warm welcome. Already practical suggestions are emerging from this visit for means of strengthening the cultural bonds between India and Iran. It has been suggested that students should be exchanged between Persian and Indian Universities. The leader of the Mission has pointed out the similarity between Indian and Iranian agricultural problems, and pro poses that Persian agricultural graduates should be sent to India to study at the famous Pusa Institute of Agriculture.

The 'l%riff Board has examined the claims of a large numfer of industries, but it has hot invariably recommended protection. It bears the interests of the consume^ in mind as well as those of industry. In some case| it has recommended high protection, as in the case ^f the steel industry; in the case of the chemical industry it proposed that grant of protection shc&amp;ld be ma'de conditions on the re organisation of'fthe industry on more efficient lines. (As this was not%lone, the protection was withdrawn after two years.)% Industries such as paper, matches, sugar have flourished under protection. The most striking case is tlit of sugar. Although India grows large quantities Ijf sugar cane, the manufacturing industry had not^been able to compete with the well-organised Javifilndustry; but in 1932 an import duty was put on sug|ir, and within two years factory output increased fo%fold, and by 1937 India was threatened with over jlroduction of sugar. Governmental policies have on the whole been against State ownership, and management of industrial enterprises, but have taSpn the shape of encouraging private enterprise. Th&amp;re are however some ex ceptions—for instance railways, which are mainly owned by the State, and ntenaged partly by the State and partly by Companies %&gt; whom the State leases the railways. The Govermi^nt of India also owns and manages its own ordnanc\factories. Effects of the present war. The present war has affected India’s industries greatly. The immediate effect o| war on policy has been to remove the financial br;me on State aid to industry; under war finance bold Ichemes are being carried out which would have beenlimpossible under the cautious finance of peace. «ig schemes of technical training have been launc^d. Industrial research is being promoted by Govermnent and has already yielded valuable aid to Int^ui industry. Lease-lend material sent to India ii»ludes vital machinery and machine tools. All thiA combined with increased demand for India’s industrl|l products for war purposes, has brought about a valt increase in Indian industrial output War conditions have led, as elsewhertX to the extension of State control in every department of economic life.

A 2 P- j ( / IRANIAN MISSION FIRST IMPRESSIONS OF TOUR IN *Z INDIA ^ NEW DELHI, Saturday.—Aga Ali Asghar Hikmat and other members of the Iranian Cultural Mission met Press re presentatives here JCriday, when the leader gave his first impressions of the country and explained something of the object of their visit. All Asghar Hikmat, who was once Minister of Education and is now a University Pro fessor in the Faculty of Science and Culture, Persia, said: 'What interests me is education. And the first impres sion one gets of the country is its development, especially in scientific research, and in education generally. Yesterday we visited the Delhi University and had a good impression of its organization. It is still ir the begin ning of its career and has a great future. This morning we visited the Agricultural Institute and found it very Interesting. . It is one of the institu tions of which we want Iran to take the fullest advantage, because in many ways, in climate and in flora and fauna, both the countries are similar; and we hope to send agricultural graduates from Teheran to this Institute here and complete their education, especially in plant and animal pests, which are similar in both countries and can, therefore, be controlled by similar methods. “We have been impressed with the great kindness and hospitality shown to us, and we acknowledge it with gratitude.” Asked about the general impression prevailing among the common people of Iran about the Indian people, his Ex cellency said that Persians remembered the age-old cultural contacts and racial J affinities, but exact knowledge of present- day India or Indian affairs was by no j means common. The Persian people’s | concepetion of India might be likened: to the conception formed by a number i of farmers who went to see an elephant for the first time and came away each with his own impression of the animal. One likened it to a pillar, another to a long tube and so on, each correct so far as the particular limb of it was concern ed but incorrect as a general picture of the animal. India was so vast in area and population that a complete picture of it was not easy to form. 'The aim of our mission,” said his Excellency, “is to establish and enlarge cultural relations' between the two countries, and the success of our mission will result in giving to the people of Iran a better definition of India and the Indian people. Among the great Indian personalities of modern times Poet Tagore was best known in Persia. This was helped by two factors. Firstly, Tagore’s works had been translated into English and Tagore himself was a great writer in that language, which, under present conditions, was the only j medium of exchange of ideas between the intellectuals of the two countries. Tagore’s works had, therefore, been translated into Persian and were read Secondly, Tagore had paid a visit to Iran before his death and was thus a living influence with those who met him. Asked about Poet Iqbal, it was pointed out by one or two members of the Mission that he was well known but not many of his books circulated in Iran. INDIANS IN IRAN Speaking of Indians at present in Iran, the leader of the Mission said they were mostly, business men. 'We have not got enough Indians of ifie intellectual class,” said his Exceiyaffcy. He agreed that an increase in ecpfltomic relations between the two 0 #hntries would lead to a strengthening of cul tural relations.—A.P.I. —•r* ^ia±ia, icciiiucai courses and search facilities.

Delhi University:- We ,v are'deeply Indebted for all the kindness with which this function has been organised in honour of this. Mission and prompts me to express our hearty thanks, onae .again for all the warm receptions that the Iridiari Government have afforded us. As a matter of fact this hospitality is not intended for only the few individuals who are now visiting your land but it..really signifies the great love and' deep affection .that you cherish-for knowledge and Science, Literature and Culture, because, the greatest honour that has been done to us consists in the fact that we are the vanguards of the Caravan of Knowledge and Culture-, which it is our fervent hope. • • • willMr H/f) - 4 - BENEFIT OF BOTH PEOPLES Similarly the books, newspapers, and magazines published in the two countries should be made to pass quickly amongst the readers in both countries leading thereoy # • to ceaseless progress in the fields of agriculture and ^ ^ industry to the mutualr benefit of Doth peoples* The oime has come when the distinctions of race and religion and diffe rences of language need no more act as carriers amongst mankind — and as against these foolish notions based on superiority of race like Fascism and Nazism all nations of the world should share on the same level the benefits of freedom and fraternity* If in the past, the nations of the orient have remained , aloof from one another as a result of bigotry and there have been some differences in their old cultures, it is now time ■ , . that with the help of better knowledge• and culture^ -.their differences should be removed and the wounds of misunderstanding thoroughly beared. In one of the historical places of beautiful Delhi, there is a board declaring the taking away of the Peacock throne by one of the Iranian Kings* I am indeed sorry and wonder why : this invader took away tne Peacock throne, which after all was no more than a piece of metal and some stones, rather than the glorious throne of knowledge and learning* The gold and the silver of the thrones will not last for ever whereas - . the pearls and diamonds of culture will go on shining through out the ages. Should it not be then that the eager youth of the world; instead of taking up arms and engaging in bloodshed, must hold up the torch of Science and in a spirit of goodwill and fraternity, carry the treasures of Culture to their lands* In short Iranians and Indians should both work together brotherslike, for the peace and salvation of mankind* This is the ideal with which we h ve come out on this Mission and in the name of this true unity which can come about only with the spread of knowledge and culture, I pray to. God for the safety and ^success of all those who have assembled here with that great object in their mind, . u .

Extract from Telegram No. 143 SiWING- from Tehran to Foreign Office, dated the 5th October 1943* /•v (s) Oultural Activities. The British Council could extend their activities by opening institutes in Shiraz, Hamadan, Meshed, Tabriz and Abadan. Each would require a staff of three peoglks i.e, fifteen in all. The Tehran Institute could usefully employ another five. It would be invaluable having professors appointed by them to Tehran University, where six could be placed. One professor for the Kerej Agricultural College, twelve teachers of English in other institutions, ten in secondary schools, physical training instructors, games coaches and scoutmasters appointed and financed by the British Council enormously increase the scope of British cultural propaganda. After the war, given a stable Government in Persia, the financial liability of the British Council in this respect could probably be reduced to about two-thirds of the cost, the Persian Government bearing the rest.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000065_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/3540</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000065</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/3540</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 28/127(1) ‘Persia.
