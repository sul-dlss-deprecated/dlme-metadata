I am very much obliged to you for allowing me to read the papers on Consular Jurisdiction, which I have read with great interest, and now return. I have only been able to read them rapidly through, as I do not like to retain them longer, as you may require them. If, however, you can spare me copies again, I should much like to have them to go carefully through when I have more time. I had not seen the joint report of Sir A. Kemball and Sir P. Francis, and, indeed, I had no idea such a report had been framed. I should have much liked to have had an opportunity of offering some remarks on a few of the points immediately affecting the Persian Gulf portion of the discussion. The proposed plan of establishing a local Judge of Appeal at Bushire seems to me rather inappropriate to the existing circumstances. Unless litigation, under greater facilities, increased enormously, and appeals were encouraged, I do not see that there would be a week's work in a year for such a functionary. The influence and local consideration of the Resident, in a great degree, are derived from his position as the one authority on the spot to whom all appeals in all matters lie. I think it is very desirable the Resident should continue to exercise, under Government, undivided control in all matters over his Assistants and Agents. Many of the cases coming forward for adjustment in the Gulf have to be decided more by local usage and tradition than by any regular system of law. Many, too, involve political considerations. The purely political duties are not sufficiently onerous and important to demand or to 'admit of the Resident being relieved of the other duties and responsibilities altogether without impairing his influence and usefulness. In fact, I do not consider there is room for both a Resident and a separate Court of Appeal at Bushire. One of them would be de trop. The case is different from that of an Ambassador or Minister at a foreign Court, where the diplomatic functions are paramount and pressing. Such an establishment at Bushire would also undoubtedly be unpalatable to the Legation, and the increase of jealousy resulting would be a serious evil and obstacle. Erom my point of view, which, of course, is restricted, what we want in the Gulf, in the first instance, is Consular commissions or warrants of some similar purport. As now constituted, for instance, the Resident might have honorary rank of Consul-General; First and Second Assistants, Consuls ; Uncovenanted Assistant, Vice-Consuls; and the Native Agents, perhaps, might be Consular Agents. In my view, local appeal should lie to the Resident from his subordinates, and the final appeal in cases where British Indians only are concerned be to Bombay; but when Persians were mixed up, to Teheran. I notice that in the joint report, and elsewhere. Sir P. Francis and Sir A. Kemball refer to the object of the proposed Order in Council as being to legalize the judicial acts of the British political and consular officers. It seems to me that the question of legality is as between the officers of Government and our own subjects only. I suppose, in absence of or pending further measures, the issue of Consular commissions would meet this part of the question, and it does not appear that it would be necessary to consult or communicate with the Persian Government before issuing such commissions. The Persian officials, I do not believe, understand any ditVerence in the matter, and look on us all in the Gulf as Consuls. I have been frequently addressed as Consul by the Governors, and the usual Persian term ' balyooz,' for Resident, equally applies to Consuls and Consul-Generals. But if, for any reason. Consular commissions were, under existing circumstances, inconvenient to issue, probably another form of warrant might be devised. The main point to bear in mind with reference to this portion of the subject is, that, granting our Government has the right to delegate jurisdiction over its own subjects, in point of fact no such jurisdiction has ever been formally delegated to the Resident and his subordinates. For cases concerning ships and ship-masters,I think the authority of the Crown is requisite, to obviate the chances of challenge. You are aware, I dare say, that there is a Dutch Consul at Bushire whose jurisdiction is recognized by the Persians, and also a Turkish Consular Agent, ditto. I wish to attract your notice to the remarks in paras. 24 and 25 of the joint Report, on the subject of Bassidore, and Angaum, or Henjam. We-have been accustomed to consider Bassidore as British territory, and to deal with it in all respects as such. No interference has been tolerated, either Persian or Arab. How ever originally obtained, I always looked on the place as now our possession by the prescriptive title acquired by long undisputed occupation. I sincerely hope that our Government will uphold their right, and stick to it. Henjam is on quite a different footing. We have there no claim to possession, any more than at Gwadur or Jask. Mr. Beilly in his Memorandum of 6th May mentions the subject of registered lists. I think he has very wisely cautioned against giving the Persian authorities that handle. The less engagement about such lists the better. We found at Bushire it was necessary to refuse to supply such lists to the officials. These are but hasty and crude remarks. I have just put down, without the slightest reserve, what occurred to me to remark, as I believe you wished. If you can spare any of the papers for me to retain for a longer time, or per manently, I shall be much obliged for them. Believe me, Yours very truly, E. C.
