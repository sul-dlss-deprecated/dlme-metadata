The Ibis has been made separately (solid cast) and is shown recumbent, a tang descending from the upper joint of the legs. The Ibis is inserted into the top of the shrine. It came with the shrine before both were cleaned, and it is the correct size for the shrine. The top of the shrine, however, has holes for 2 tangs ans Ibis has but one. An extension of the base before both the ibis and the shrine bears six holes for insertion of other figures. \r\n\r\nCondition: Wooden core of the base has been dried out and cracked. The entire base has been stripped by treatment and is much cracked all round. The surface is very pitted. The Ibis is the same all over the surface, it is also very dirty and scratched, Fractures appear right leg.
