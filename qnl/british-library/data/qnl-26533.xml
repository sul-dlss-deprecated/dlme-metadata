It would be highly inconvenient, b we would do it. I have another sugg tion provided the area is satisfactory, a^id I think it would be, from a technical p/int of view. There is no question aboutf the summer time, when the swans are Away in the Swannery to the west. l/ that time, no injury can possibly be dcpe. It is a perfectly reasonable site /or this range during the summer. The a/xiety is in the winter months, when /hey are on this narrow triangle of water where the weed grows most extensiv/ly. What I would suggest is that, as/the swans move, so we should move, aryl that when the swans come on to their/winter feed ing-ground we should mover the target a distance of about two mil^ to the west, which would be rather n/ar to the site which was previously co found unsuitable for summer range. If technical point of vie the Air Force, I wo/ld undertake that it should be done. In that way I think we could do the maximum possible to ensure that, whetUer the swans are in their summer or /heir winter quarters, they shall incur t/e least possible risk. I am afraid I/have spoken at rather great length, biy I felt that your Lord- ships had a replly genuine anxiety in this matter—as/[ had.

GREAT HANISH ISLANDS. Lord LLOYD asked whether the Great Hanish Islands in the Red Sea are in the occupation of Great Britain. If not, in whose occupation are these islands, and how long have they been so occu pied. The UNDER-SECRETARY of STATE for FOREIGN AFFAIRS (Earl Stan hope) : The status of the Great Hanish group of islands remains indeterminate under Article 16 of the Treaty of Lausanne, the first paragraph of which reads:165 Great Banish Islands 166 [LORDS] . “ Turkey hereby renounces all rights and title whatsoever over or respecting t!he v terri tories situated outside the frontiers laid down in the present Treaty and the islands other than those over which her sovereignty is recognised by the said Treaty, the future of these territories and islands being settled or to be settled by the parties con cerned,” A small Italian armed post was estab lished on each of the two principal islands of the Great Hanish group in December, 1929, in order to protect Earl Stanhope. natives of Eritrea fishing ip. those waters. In 1931 the Italian Government, in response to a request from His Majesty’s Government, gave a satisfactory assur ance that the establishment of Italian posts in these islands did not involve or 'constitute any claim to s ^ereignty over the islands themselves House adjourned at twenty-five minutes before se’fcm o’clock.Department.

By what stretch of imagination the HANISH Group can properly be considered to lie within Italian jurisdiction and against whom protection is required are points upon which comment is superfluous.

HIS Majesty's representative at Rome presents his compliments to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and has the honour to transmit herewith copy of a note from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, Rome, dated the 16th November, 1931, respecting the Italian occupation of Great Hanish and Jebel Zukur Islands. Rome, November 18, 1931. Enclosure in Xo. 1. ?. aSMbo Note verbale. (Translation.) THE Royal Ministry for Foreign Affairs have the honour to acknowledge receipt of the pro-rnemoria of the 5th October, in which His Britannic Majesty's Embassy desired to obtain an assurance that the Royal Government were in agreement with the British Government in considering that the islands Great Hanish and Jebel Zukur came within the scope of paragraph 5 of the conclusions of the Rome conversations of 1927 ; and that, in particular, the establishment of Italian posts in those islands did not involve or constitute any claim to sovereignty over the islands themselves. The Royal Ministry for Foreign Affairs have no difficulty in assuring His Britannic Majesty’s Embassy that, in confirmation of what was previously stated in the pro-memoria of the ilth April, 1930, the question of sovereignty in the Hanish group of islands remams m abeyance, notwithstanding the establishment there of Italian posts for the protection of Italian private interests, an establishment which dates from December 1929. The international juridical status of the Hanish group of islands is thus considered by the Royal Italian Government to be in the same category as that of the islands Farsan and Cameran, mentioned in the conclusions of the Rome conversations of 1927, or of the- Islands of Abu Ail ( which incidentally form part of tne Hanish group), Zebair and Jebel Tair, the status of which formed the subject of consideration by the British and Italian Governments in 1928, during for the Convention regarding Lighthouses in the Red Sea, to the J effect that as regards those islands also the question of sovereignty was to remain in abeyance. The Royal Ministry for Foreign Affairs have, moreover, no difficulty in assuring His Britannic Majesty's Embassy that the Hanish group of islands, as. in fact, all the Red Sea islands mentioned above, come within the scope of paragraph 5 of the conclusions of the conversations of Rome, both as regards economic and commercial freedom in the Red Sea Islands for the citizens and subjects of the two countries, and as regards the character and extent of the protection which those citizens and subjects may legitimately expect from their respective Governments. ^ • / EdQSzUM Ministry for Foreign Affairs, Rome, November 16, 1931 Year X [300 aa—1]Notes.

WITH reference to your despatch No. 1150 of the 25th September last, [ have the honour to report that an early opportunity was taken to broach the question of the Italian occupation of Great Hanish and Jebel Zukur islands with the head of the African Department of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. 2. Signor Guarnaschelli said that, of course, he must consult the Colonial Office before expressing any opinion officially, but, speaking personally, he fully agreed that the establishment of these posts could not involve any claim to Italian sovereignty over these islands, since this was a question which both sides had agreed to leave in suspense for the present. In order that there should be no misunderstanding, an aide-memoire, of which I have the honour to enclose a copy, was left with Signor Guarnaschelli. He read it without further comment, merely remarking that he hoped to be in a position shortly to address a written reply to the Embassy which would be satisfactory to His Majesty’s Government. This exchange of memoranda might be useful in later years as affording further evidence, if this were needed, of the desire of both parties to leave the question of sovereignty in abeyance. I have, &amp;c. J. MURRAY. Enclosure in No. 1. A ide-memoire. IN reply to an enquiry by the Resident of Aden, the Italian consul at Aden stated that the Government of Eritrea had granted a fishing concession to an Italian firm, and at the request of the latter had established small armed posts on the islands of Great Hanish and Jebel Zukur for the particular purpose of protecting the personnel and vessels of the concessionnaire. His Majesty's Government consider that these two islands come within the scope of paragraph 5 of the conclusions of the Rome conversations of 1927, which reads as follows : — “ That there should be economic and commercial freedom on the Arabian coast and the islands of the Red Sea for citizens and subjects of the two countries and that the protection which such citizens and subjects may legitimately expect from their respective Governments should not assume a political character or complexion.” His Majesty's Embassy have been asked to obtain an assurance that the Italian Government concur and that, in particular, the establishment of Italian posts is not to be regarded as involving or constituting any claim to Italian sovereignty over these islands.

A similar letter is being sent to the Foreign Office. I am, etc., (Sgd.) H. Cowell. THE SECRETARY, ADMIRALTY.SECRET. No. S.15.3. „ THE RHSIHENCY, Aden, 24th June, 1931. My Lord, I have the honour to enclose for Your Lordship’s information the copy of a Secret letter dated the 30th May 1931 from the Commander-in-Command, H.M.S. 'DAHLIA M , of the Red Sea Patrol, reporting the presence of Italian armed posts on GREAT HAITI SH, and JEBEL ZUKUR Islands, in the RED SEA. 2. By the Resident’s instructions, immediately on receipt of the above report, an informal enquiry was made from the Italian Consul in ALEH, who professed to have no knowledge of the matter, and offered to obtain information by telegram from the Governor of ERITREA. 3. On the 20th June the Italian Consul called on the Protectorate Secretary and stated that from a telegram that he had received from ASMARA, and from the Official Gazette of the Government of ERITREA dated the 3rd March 1931, he had learned that the Government of ERITREA had granted a concession for ’big fishing’ in the territorial waters of that Colony, from EDI), southwards to RAS DUMEIRA, to an Italian firm of ASAB, MESSRS. DITTA S. CABNATA &amp; CO. This concession was transferred on the 28th January 1931 by decree in the said Official Gazette to DITTA S, CAITITATA. 4. The Italian Consul stated that at the request of the concessionnaire, the Government of ERITREA had recently His Majesty’s Secretary of State for the Colonies, London.recently established small armed posts on the two islands referred to, for the particular purpose of protecting the personnel and vessels of the concession- naire. 5. I have no reason to suppose that the establishment of these two posts is for any direct pumose other than that explained by the Italian Consul. At the same time I would venture to question whether the right of the concessionnaire to fish in the territorial waters of ERITREA would legitimate his claim for protection by the Government of ERITREA at GREAT HA in SH and JEBEL ZUKUR Islands, that lie approximately 30-40 miles from the Eritrean Coast. I would also suggest that the form in which this protection is given, e.g. hy the establishment of resident armed posts on these islands, is one which may well be expected to assume a political character or complexion. In this connection I refer to Article 5 of the 'Rome Conversations” of 1927. 6. I have sent a copy of this despatch to Lieutenant-Colonel Reilly who is now in England on leave in order that he may have the opportunity, if necessary, of discussing this matter with Your Lordship. I have, etc., ( Sgd. ) H.M. Wightwick Acting Resident etc.at Aden. 30th May, 1931. Sir, I have the honour to report that when on patrol in the vicinity of the Banish Islands on May 27th, small military posts, manned by Italian Native Soldiers, were discovered on the islands of Jebel Zukur and Great Banish. 2. During the forenoon of the 27th., I stopped a dhow, flying the Italian colours, for interrogation, and was informed that she was taking seven Askar is from Jebel Zukur back to As sab. The men were only too pleased to tell me where to find their post. 3. I proceeded to the vicinity in the ship and anchored, sending in my 1’irst Lieutenant in a boat to ascertain particulars, under the guise of offering them any assistance, supplies of water etc. , that they might require. The post on Jebel Zuicur was manned by three men only, but at one time had consisted of 20 men, tnen being reduced to 10, andnow to 3. Seven men had just left the post in the dhow already mentioned. 4. The post consisted of a large wooden hut, with about eight matting huts built in the back grouna. Each man had a rifle and 60 rounds of ammunition, and were allowed to have their wives with them. t They stated that they were provisioned from Assab by dhow every ten days, and were relieved every four months. They thought the post had been in existence for some years, but were indefinite of this point, and I am convinced that it has been established less than one yeax .The men volunteered the statement that another post was established on Great Hani sh Island. 5. After recovering my boat, I proceeded to that Island, and found the post at its southern end, manned by two men only. A similar hut and matting barracks had been erected and the men stated that they suffered much from sicicness which accounted for two men only being there. Theywere each supplied with 100 rounds of ammunition. These men were glad to receive a supply of fresh water as the dhow with their supplies was some days overdue. 6. The Italian flag was not being flown. At Jebel Zukur, the soldiers stated that one flag was supnlied between the two posts. At Great Hanish, the men said it had been sent back to Assab for repair as it had been w torn by the wind'. They pointed to a large board to which they nailed it when available. 7. At both posts, the men stated that they had instructions to report the arrival of all ships and dhows and their nationality. 8. I have thought it my duty to report the facts to the Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean Fleet by W/T, but deferred doing so until I had ascertained that these facts were not already well knownto you. A paraphrase A of my message to the Commander-in-Jhief, is attached hereto. 9. It appeared to me that the positions for these posts had been selected with some care to render them inconspicuous, and had it not been for tne chance encounter with the dhow, they might well have passed for fishermen’s huts, when seen from seaward. 10 .10. I ani convinced that these posts have been established only within the last twelve months. I had considerable dealings with the Commissioner at As sab a year ago, concerning the recovery from the sea of the late Major Hayes, who was found on Jebel Zukur, and I am sure that had a post been established on the island at that time he must have mentioned it. I have, etc. , ( Sgd. ) R.A. Jackson C omman der-in-Command. The political Resident, Aden.PARAPHRASE . Small posts manned by Italian Native Troops were discovered on Jebel Zukur and Great Hanish Island when on patrol on May 27th. These posts have been in existence for some months and are provisioned and manned from Assad. I delayed making this report until after arriving at Aden and seeing Political Resident, lest the existence of these posts was already known to him. This was his first knowledge of them, and he has interviewed Italian Consul, who was also without information on the subject. The Consul has promised to make immediate enquiries by telegraph and to inform Resident of reply. I will forward another renort on receipt of information from Resident.mmCONFIDENTIAL rv Lj 1 P. z.

I am accordingly to suggest that the proposed representations to the Italian Government should be made with reference to Article 5 of the 'Rome Conversations' of 1927 rather than Article 16 of the Treaty of Lausanne. The former would appear to provide for leaving the sovereignty of these islands unsettled indefinitely, whereas the latter suggests the settlement of their sovereignty by agreement. Italy would apparently welcome an attempt settle the sovereignty of this group (see her note of April 11 of which a copy was sent to the Admiralty under Foreign Office ... reference No*E*2083/G.Secret) and seems disposed to think that 1he 1927 conversations afford a basis for such a course. It would not appear difficult to dispose of this suggestion, however, If at a later stage she showed any strong inclination to retreat from the 1927 declaration. Article 16 of the Treaty of Lausanne could then be adduced as a legal basis for denying any claim to sovereignty except by agreement. The Under Secretary of State, FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.I.The point of importance at the moment appears to he to prevent the building up of a position which, if the fate of the islands was eventually discussed under Article 16 of the Lausanne Treaty, would lead to their being allotted to Italy. This, it would seem, can only be done by reference to the 1927 conversations, the agreement being extended, if possible, to bring these islands within the scope of Article 4 (see paragraph 9 of report of Conference at Foreigi Office). 4.- A copy of this letter has been sent to the Colonial Office.

(S 3601/3053/91) Record of a meeting held in Mr.Rendel's room at the Foreign Office on the 6th July to consider certain questions connected with Red Sea islands. Present: Mr.G.W.Rendel, Foreign Office, in the Chair; Mr.W.H.Hancock and Captain Miles, R.N., Admiralty; Mr•G.L.M.Clauson, Colonial Office; Group Captain R.E.C.Peirse, Air Ministry; Mr.J.G.Laithwaite, India Office; Mr.G.Shannon, Dominions Office; Mr.J.Murray,C.M.G., (Counsellor Designate to His Majesty T s Embassy, Rome); Mr,C.W.Baxter and Mr.C.F.A.Warner, Foreign Office. Part One - Italian Activities in the Hanish Islands and in Jebel Zukur. I'.IR.EjjI7D.0L explained that the various questions for discussion all turned on the attitude of the Italian Government and that an opportunity had therefore been taken to secure the presence of Mr .Murray who was leaving lor Rome the following day to take up his post as Counsellor of His Majesty’s Embassy. 2, The first question to be considered concerned the recent discovery by one of His Majesty’s sloops in the Red Sea that small posts of Italian troops had been established on the islands of Great Hanish and Jebel Zukur. Mr.RendelMr.Rendel recalled that last year the Italian construction of a lighthouse on South-West Haycock Island, to the south-west of the Banish group, had led His Majesty’s Government to ask the Italian Government for a declaration that they did not claim sovereignty over that island. The Italian Government had replied that they considered South-West Haycock Island to be a part not of the Hanish group but of the Mohabbacah Archipelago, and that they had always held that South-West Haycock Island together with all the other islands of that archipelago formed part of the territory of Eritrea. The Italian Government, further, while making u a special reserve regarding Italian ’'sovereignty over South-West Haycock”, stated that they had ”no difficulty in consenting to the question being 'considered on the same lines as that of the sovereignty 1 of all the islands of the Hanish group, in accordance 'with the spirit of the conversations of Rome of 1927'. Research at the Foreign Office had then disclosed that an earlier claim to sovereignty over South-West Haycock Island made by the Italian Government had been tacitly admitted by Her Majesty’s Government in 1892 and that therefore it was impossible no?; to contest the Italian claim. 3. It looked now as though the Italians might be taking the first steps towards the establishment of a claim to sovereignty over Great Hanish and Jebel Zukur. The Resident at Aden, to whom the discovery of the Italian troops on these islands had been reported by the Senior Naval Officer Red Sea Sloops, had thereupon made enquiries of the Italian Consul at Aden; the latter, however, was ignorant of the facts and had referred to his Government. ItIt was possible that the Italian Government might take the line that the Italian position in Great Hanish and Jebel Zukur was analogous to the British position in Kamaran, and that they might maintain that the Italian posts being maintained for the protection of Italian subjects from Eritrea engaged by an Italian Tinned Fish Company in those islands just as the British administration in Kamaran was due to the fact that the majority of pilgrims passing through Kamaran were British. This might be an honest statement of the Italian view of their position in these islands; but on the other hand, one could not overlook the possibility that the establishment of troops on these two islands was the thin edge of a wedge designed eventually to result in an Italian claim to sovereignty over all the islands of the Hanish group. In these circumstances, he thought the first step should be to ascertain the views of the Service Departments on the strategic importance of the islands in question. 4. Captain MILBS said that the Admiralty attached considerable strategic importance to the islands, since anyone having complete control of them and able to mount guns on them, would be in a position to control the traffic of the Red Sea. It appeared that in any case the islands might form a valuable observation post, reporting station, and possibly advance base - particularly if they could be supplied with condensers. 5. A discussion followed on the question whether it could be confidently asserted that the Hanish Islands had formed part of the Ottoman llmpire, were covered by the Treaty7. Treaty of Lausanne, and were in a completely different category from South-West Haycock. It was pointed out that the deepest channel in that region of the Red Sea ran between Haycock and the Hanish Islands, and that the group as a whole at first sight certainly appeared to be nearer to the Arabian than to the African coast. A Foreign Office memorandum of 1880 on the question of jurisdiction over the Islands in the Red Sea set the Hanish group down among the islands on the Arabian coast of the Red Sea and concluded that they were undeh the sovereignty and within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Sultan of Turkey; whereas. Haycock was allotted to the list of islands near the centre of the Red Sea, the jurisdiction over which was considered in the memorandum to be doubtful. 6. Mr.REHDEL said that a case might also be based on the concession granted by the Ottoman Government to the Ottoman Lighthouse Company for the erection of a lighthouse on the island of Abu Ail, which clearly belongs to the same group as Jebel Zukur. This concession could hardly have been granted unless the islands had admittedly formed part of the Ottoman dominions. The conclusion was reached that a strong case existed for contending that Great Hanish and Jebel Zukur fell within the scope of Article 16 of the Treaty of Lausanne, under which the future of the islands renounced by Turkey is left to be settled n by the parties concerned”. Legally therefore the Italians could not openly annex Hanish and Jebel Zukur without the prior consent of the other Powers concerned - but they might peg out a fairly strong claim, and meanwhile secure effective control.7# Mr »RSNDSL then referred to the probability of the Italians drawing an analogy between their position in Great Hanish and Jebel Zukur and that of His Majesty’s Government in Kamaran. He pointed out that under Article 4 of the conclusions of the Rome conversations of 1927, our position in Kamaran was weak and circumscribed, since it had been agreed that it was in the interests of both parties to the conversations that no European Power should establish itself in Kamaran. This Article of the conclusions of the Rome conversations did not cover Great Hanish and Jebel Zukur, to which only Article 5 could be held to apply. The terms of Article 5 were as follows ’’That there should be economic and commercial 'freedom on the Arabian coast and the islands of the ’’Red Sea for citizens and subjects of the two countries 'and that the protection which such citizens and subjects 'may legitimately expect from their respective governments 'should not assume a political character or complexion.' 8. Obviously, the conclusions of the Rome conversations restricted what His Majesty’s Government could do in Kamaran far more than what the Italians were entitled to do on Great Hanish and Jebel Zukur. 9. A suggestion was then considered that the best way of tying the Italians’ hands in regard to these latter islands might be (a) to ask the Italian Government for a declaration that they made no claim to sovereignty over the islands; and (b) thereafter to develop the analogy between Jebel Zukur and Hanish on the one hand and Kamaran on the other, and endeavour to secure Italian consent to bringing Jebel Zukur and Great Hanish within the scope of Article 4 of the conclusions of the Rome conversations on the same basis as Kamaran, i.e. to get them to accept a declarationdeclaration that it ?ms in the interests of Great Britain and Italy not only that no European Power should establish itself in Kamaran etc. (article 4), but equally that no European Power should establish itself in Banish and Jebel Zukur. 10. Mr.LAITHWAITE remarked that Great Banish and Jebel Zukur had been occupied by British troops in 1915 but had been abandoned after six months as almost uninhabitable. 11 • Mr.MURRAY enquired whether in these circumstances there was really much to fear from an Italian occupation of the islands. It hardly seemed possible that the Italians would undertake the enormous amount of work and expense necessary to make the islands inhabitable for white troops, and to mount guns on them of the necessary calibre. Was it really necessary to take up the question with the Italian Government at all? 12. The ADMIRALTY REPRESENTATIVES said that they feared not so much an active occupation of the island by the Italians and their conversion into an armed base, as the gradual building up of a position, which, if the fate of the islands was eventually discussed under Article 16 of the Treaty of Lausanne, would lead to their being allotted to Italy. 13. Group Captain Peirse, in reply to a question, said that the Islands appeared to have no strategic importance as an air base owing to their proximity to the Eritrean coast. Be agreed, however, with the Admiralty representative that, if developed by the Italians, these Islands would become a menace in the Red Sea. 14. &amp; discussion ensued on the various possible means of/of preventing the gradual establishment of an Italian claim to sovereignty over the islands. Beside the proposal mentioned v above to endeavour to bring Great Hanish and Jebel Zukur within the scope of Article 4 of the conclusions of the Home conversations on the same basis as Kamaran, the possibility was considered of proposing a joint Anglo-Italian or international occupation both of Kamaran and of Hanish and Jebel Zukur which would ensure the neutralisation of both. This would afford an effective means of, so to speak, sterilizing the Italian occupation of Hanish and Jebel Zukur - but at the cost of sacrificing our own position in % Kamaran. Both the Admiralty and Air Ministry Representatives agreed that our interest in Kamaran was too great to make this worth while. 15. The meeting was faced with the difficulty of estimating the possible Italian re-actions to the various courses proposed. In particular, it was pointed out that there was a danger of stimu lating Italian interest in Great Hanish and Jebel Zukur, if too much anxiety regarding the Italian posts on these islands was displayed by His Majesty 1 s Government. 16. Eventually it was agreed that it would be best to await a report from the Resident at Aden on his further discussion of the matter with the Italian Consul, before deciding on a definite course of action. The general conclusion was reached, however, that it would be dangerous, having regard to the views of the Service Departments as to the possible strategic value of the islands, tacitly to accept the gradual establishment of an Italian claim to sovereignty over them. It was agreed that it would almost certainly be necessary to obtain a formal statement from that Italians that they did not claim sovereignty over the islands and recognised them as being covered by Article 16 of the Treaty of Lausanne. It was also agreed that His Majesty f s Sloops in the Red Sea should in future visit the islands about twice a year and report on Italian activities there. FOREIGN OFFICE.

S*W.l. 24th July, 1930. ^ &gt;• With reference to India Office letter No. P.2849/30 of the 28th May, I am directed by Mr. Secretary Henderson to transmit to you the accompanying copy of a memorandum regarding the claim of the Italian Government to sovereignty over South- West Haycock: Island, advanced in paragraph 4 of the aide- mdmoire from the Italian Ministry for Foreign Affairs, a translation of which was enclosed in the letter from this department No. E 2083/64/91 of the 5th May. 2. It will be seen from paragraphs 13 and 14 of this memorandum that a note from His Majesty's Ambassador at Home to the Italian Government, dated the 3rd February, 1892, contained a statement to the effect that the jurisdiction over certain islands off the Eritrean coast, including South-West Haycock Island, 'appeared to belong to Italy'. Thereafter His Majesty's Government seem to-have tacitly accepted the claim of the Italian Government to jurisdiction over this island (South-West Haycock Island) made in February, 1892, and their claim to sovereignty made in June of the same year. 3. These claims do not appear to be based on strong grounds. They seem to be founded exclusively on the agreement of the 9th December, 1888 between the Italian Government and the Sultan Mohamed Anfari of Aussa, which only applied to the coast between Amfida and Has Dumeira. Moreover, the right of the Sultan to cede to the Italian Government islands which apparently belonged to Turkey (or possibly to Egypt, as a grantee from Turkey) is not clear. 4.

MDiA a.4 Mr. Henderson is advised, however, that, in view of the correspondence exchanged between His Majesty's Government and the Italian Government, in 1892, referred to in paragraph 2 above, - the existence of which has presumably not been overlooked by the Italian Government - His Majesty's Government could not well contest, on these or other grounds, the validity of the claim to sovereignty over South-West Haycock Island, advanced in the aide-mdmoire from the Italian Ministry for Foreign Affairs of the 11th April last, 5, The somewhat obscure offer made in the final passage of that aide-mdmoire appears to Mr. Henderson to amount merely to a declaration that the Italian Government are prepared to discuss with His Majesty's Government, in the spirit of the Home conversations of 1927, (a) the question of the sovereignty of the Hanish islands, and (b) any questions concerning South- West Haycock Island other than the question of its sovereignty. Subject to the views of the other departments of His Majesty's Government concerned, Mr. Henderson is not disposed to think that any useful purpose would be served by accepting that offer at the present time. 6 .

Subsequent to 1880, however, the territorial position and Jurisdiction along the Egyptian coast of the ied Sea became modified, as a result of Italian action long that orti n of the coast which now con stitutes the Italian colony of Lritrea, including the portion off which the Mohabbakah Islands are situated* 5* By notets exchanged between the Italian ambassador in London and Lord Salisbury, dated li&amp;y 24/11, 1887, it was agreed that the Italian authorities should eyercise surveillance over the African coast of the Ked Sea from Massowah as far north as Has Xasar* 6 . This agreement was ^ade in consequence of the Confidential Derations which Italy was prooosing to tafce against 5 5 h 7 . N O • 6 7 • abyssiniu, and it appears to have been intended at the time that the arrangement was to have a temporary and not a territorial character. i.s a natter of f ct, how ever, the Italian right of surreillance drifted into what was tantamount to territorial rights along the littoral. Lord Cromer (then sir Baring) pointed Confidential out in 1890: • ♦ • 'I a/n not re ared to deny that we 5952. ho.136 'have, as a matter of fact, both tacitly and by im plication, allow d the Italians to acquire what is 'almost tantamount to territorial rights along the 'lied Sea Littoral, and t! at it is now too late to'fall back ur.on the terms of the Agreement of ilay, '1887* We have never raised any objection to the 'exercise of acte of sovereipnty by the Italians along ’the coast between Massowah and Aas Kasar, and they 'might not unreasonably refer t&gt; the representations 'made by Her Majesty’s Ambassador at Home in October, '18B7, on the subject of the establishment of a 'custom house at Tuklai as an implied recognition of 'their osition*' 7, Further, on December 9th, 1888, an arreement was signed between the Italian government and the Sultan .^nfari of .ussa, by article 3 of which 'the 'Sultan Mohammed j.nfari recopnisee all the Dankale 'coast from Amfila up to Has Du/rieira as Italian 'possessions*' 8 * In considering, therefore, the question of jurisdiction and sovereignty over the Mohabbakah drour and other islands off the Danafcil coast, it seems necessary to take into account ( 1 ) that by the nglo-Itulian apreenent of May, 1887, Has K&amp;sar be came the southern limit of the Kgy^tian sphere of influence and (2) that by the Italian agreement of December 9th, 1888, with the Aussa, the Italians elai ad ossesaion of all the coast between ijnfila and Has Dumeira* .ulso the Italian law of January 1st, 1890, established the Italian colony of Kritrea, the coast line of which stretches from Has JC&amp;sar in the north to Has Dumeiru in the south# 9 , The question of jurisdiction over the group of islands off ^ssab Bay (Danakil coast) in which South-'estSouth-West Haycock lies arose In connexion with the lighting of a new route through the Hod iiea as an ^ alternative to the route which was to be lighted under » concession for that * urr?ose granted by the Turkish government to 11* Michel and I * Collae in 1881. For years no gregrese was made in the construction of the lights under the 1881 concession. Her Majesty’s iovernzaent themselves, for various reasons, held aloof from recognising the concession or even discussing its tariff, as an alternative to the Confidential .ichel-Colles scheme of lights, the Board of trade 5337.No.19. suggested in 1886 the possibility of lighting a new rout© which 'lies to the westward of the HaFjish 'Islands and leads through waters lately under the 'jurisdiction of y t, out rob bly Bubject to the 'sovereignty of Turkey, towards as sab Bay, now 'occupied by Italy.'• 10. In 1890, this alternative route again came under consideration. The islands where it was suggested Confidential that lights should be constructed were North- ast 6093.No.45. uoin, South-test Hocks, one of the Haycocks, and Harbi, and the Board of Trade raised the point whether they were under Italian jurisdiction. Sir £• Hertslet’s view was that the right of sovoreirnty ov.,r all the islands in ^ question was Turkish, and that the Khedive had no right of sovereignty ov^r any portion of the territory on the mainland or over the islands adjacent thereto which hud ! been placed under his jurisdiction. This view, and the Confidential fact that the Italluns had not assumed the protectorate 6093.NO.46. of that cart of the cocst, was oommu^iestcd to the Board of Trade, ftith regard to the rower who should construct&lt;eyptl*n jurion; &lt;»nu th t ty th« ngreeuent of Deamaber 9 th, the Sultan of Aujis^ recognised all the Wiknii coaai from Arafil*» to *&gt;» Itooria ae Italian ,) 0 ‘«esBloin». The pro oeed new oitoo were opposite this co»»t end, with the e/ception of South- est jocks, wtiioh appeared don'ttful, naed to he within Italian juriBalctiori.

Whilst therefore it cannot be affirmed, as laid down in the Aide-Memoire under reply, that South-West Haycock Ielan is belongs to the Hanish group, and whilst the Royal Government must make a soecial reserve regarding Italian sovereignty over this island, the Royal ministry of Foreign Affairs have no diffic ulty in consenting to the question bein=r considered on the same lines as that of the sovereignty of all the islands of the Han I ah group.* in accordance with the spirit of the conversations of Rome of 1927.KQ DISTHIBUTIQa .

A somewhat similar question has now arisen on which His Majesty* s Government are confident that the Royal Italian Government will be able to afford them like satis faction. Having regard to the practice initiated in February 1927 and thereafter maintained to the satisfaction of both parties, whereby the two Governments keep in close touch with each other on all matters affecting the Red bea and Southern Arabia, Hia Majesty* s Government desire to state that rumours have reached London regarding an alleged intention on the part of the Royal Italian Government to erect a lighthouse on South-West Haycock Island which lies to the south-west of Great Banish in the Banish group of Islands* 3. Hia Majesty’s Government will be glad to learn whether there is any truth in these rumours and, in the event of their being well founded, to receive an assurance that the Royal Italian Government regard gmth-West Haycock and the rest of the Hanish group of Islands as covered bythe term a of paragraph 5 of the Con olu alon e reached by Signor ftaaparini and Signor (Xiariglla with His majesty’s Ambassador and the late sir Gilbert Clayton on February 7th, 1927. In particular they would be grateful for an assurance that. In the event of the erection of a lighthouse, this Is not to be regarded as involving or constituting a claim to sovereignty over the island* 4. The Royal Italian Government will realise that the action of Hla majesty 1 s Government in seeking this assurance is similar to that which the Royal Italian Government took themselves in 1928 in regard to the status of the islands on which the ex-Turkish lighthouses are situated - one of which vAbu Ail) is one of the group of islands now in question.Copy * British ^basay, rtomo* March 27th 1930.

Reference may also be made to the informal correspondence in the separate file attached,- 2- An inter-Departmental meeting took place on the 24th January at the Colonial Office to consider the line of action to be taken. It was attended by Foreign Office, Air Ministry, Admiralty, and representatives of this Office. The question was discussed exhaustively in all its bearings. The conclusions reached by the meeting were - (a) that the terms of the Rome conversations left both parties to those conversations economic and commercial freedom, etc., in the group of islands in question. It would be difficult, therefore, to object to the establishment of an Italian lighthouse on South-west Haycoca, and equally difficult to object to the establishment of a fishery station on Great Hanish. On the other hand, His Majesty's Government would be entirely within their rights in establishing^ should they so desire, a commercial post of some sort on Hanish to enable them to keep in touch with developments at the fishery station; (b) that the essential thing was to secure that the sovereignty or these islands was not prejudiced. The Defence Departments intimated that, could an assurance to this effect be secured from tire Italian Government, they would be quite content to leave matters at that. -s -*40r- 3818a/ (c) The question of arranging for the provision of further more definite evidence from the Southern Red Se|a was considered. After discussion it was decided that the rumours reported by the Senior Naval Officer to be current in Red Sea shipping circles afforded a sufficient basis for representations. 3. It was agreed that the Foreiga Office should prepare a draft despatch to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Rome, which should be circulated for concurrence. The draft is enclosed in Lord Monteagle’s demi-official letter of the 30th January, below. It t will be seen that the Foreigi Office are anxious to learn in the course of to-day whether we concur, with a view to despatching the instructions to the Ambassador in Monday's bag. The draft speaks for itself. It is not perhaps very categorical in its terns, but it should serve the purpose of drawing the Italians. There is reason to believe that they are not very easy as to their position m the matter and it is to be hoped that they will give us the required assurance about sovereigity, and will not, e.g., endeavoujr to raise the question whether South-west Haycock cannot b^ regarded as properly dependent from Eritrea, and as falling outside the category of islands the status of which remains to be determined under Article 16 of the Treaty of Lausanne. I submit that I may be authorised to inform the Foreiga Office that we concur in the draft. Copies can at a later stage be sent to the Government of India. ^ ft ''■y' (t “»»'&gt;• J , ^ 7 - , 7 ^ U- ^ b fa &amp; Ufafa X -xyZ/*- Ttw-v&lt; / ^ U C byifaJ-/'N g «« Sir h* drftimm# No • mm Copy Admiralty C*0.

With reference to Admiralty letter U.02929 of 30th October, 1 am commanded by My Lords Commissioners o the Admiralty to acquaint you that i’hey haTe further considered the questions arising from the Italian activities In the Island*of the Jebel Zukar and Hanlsh group, as a result of further Information as to the nature of these activities and in the light of a semi official discussion with your department which was held at the Admiralty on 6th Ifovember, 1929. 2. It appears from the reports that have been received that the Italians are actually taking steps to erect a lighthouse on the douth West Haycock, which lies at the southern end of this group of islands, and also that they are con temp la id ng the establishment of a Fishery station on Great Hanlsh. 3. fhe agreement which was reached in February, 1927, with the Italians, as to British and Italian interests in the fced 3ea did not specially mention this group he Under Secretary of ^tate, Foreign Office, 1gronp of Islanas amongst those on whleh Great Britain jjid Italy agreed that they did not wish any itoropean Power to establish Itself* 4* The Clause of the Agreement which should be regarded as applying to this group of islands is therefore Clause 5, whichz^ade as follows:- 5* That there should be economic and commercial freedom on the Arabian Coast and the islands of the hed lea for oitlsens and subjects of the two countries, and that the protection which such citizens and subjects may legitimately expect from their respective Governments should not assume a political character or complexion* 5. If this view is correct, it would appear to be impossible to raise any objection to the establish ment of a Fishery station on Hanlsh by the Italians* 6* The erection of a lighthouse is, however, a different matter, since it may be regarded as implying some definite claim to sovereignty* It tea for this reason that in the draft agreement relating to the ex-Turkish li* hthouses in the Red Sea it has definitely been provided that the cp estion of sovereignty shall not in any way be prejudiced* 7. The fact, that wa have only learnt of the proposed erection of this lighthouse through secret sources and not through the ordi nary channels of communicationcomiiiuiiication of aaTigational loforiaa'fcioiit raises a suapicion that th® Itallaxis theaasivea do in fact regard this enterprise as something in the nature of an occupation and wish to present us with a fait accompli• 8. It appears in fact possible that the Italians, after erecting the lighthouse, may claim that the island is Italian soil and was not covered by the agreement of February, 1927. Such a case might not be without foundation. fhe island of 3oath Vest Haycock is only some 20 miles from the Italian Coast; although the islands appear naturally to form one group and are regarded by us as having originally belonged to 'Turkey, My Lords h&amp;Te not been able to find any conclusive evidence in that direction. Uost atlases show the whole group as part of Arabia, and they aro so ahovn in certain Sar Office maps dated 1906 and 1907, but the 'Index Geographicus' (dated 1864), shors it as part of Abyssinia, and therefore now of Italian ^ritrea. fhe War Office will be asked the authority for their fflSp 3. 9. iiy iords therefore flesire to 8Qgg,at that H.LS. .......-4- s H.k* AubAasador at Horn should inform the Italian Government that raraoura have reached the British Government es to the intended erection of a light- house on South Seat Kaycock by the Italians, and that the British Government would therefore be glad to be assure' 5 that the Italian Government regarded this and the other islands of the Hanish group as corning under Clause 5 of the Agreement of February, 1927, This would be similar to the action taken by the Italians in the case of the ex-furklsh light houses (Foreign Office letter A.5018/73/91 of 14/12/P8. 10. 1 am to add that the erection of a light house on Jouth l est Haycock would be most useful for the navigation of the Ked ^ea. ^’ho British Government therefore could r£ise no objection to the establishment of such a lighthouse by the Ittlians if the Italians dealt red that the Lighthouse was being erected solely in the interests of navigation and vlth no political intent. 11.

These Islands are barren and appear devoid of any possibility of commercial development consequently the use of such a pretext can only lead to a certain suspicion. Occupation for commercial purposes would only be one step to occupation for political and naval purposes, which would be a grave embarrassment to our shipping in those waters and on the Imperial highway to the East. In the event of certain wars, the Italians established on these Islands could render assistance to, or could connive in the operations of, enemy submarines. 3. My Lords are aware of the political issues connected with this group of Islands, i.e. that they RY OP STATE, come From the Admiralty point of view it would be there COLONIAL OFFICE, S.W.l.come under Article XVI of the Treaty of Lausanne, and that as regards Italy and ourselves our actions are governed hy the confidential record of conversations of February, 1927, (Rome), when we agreed that there should be economical and commercial freedom on the Arabian coast and the Islands of the Red Sea for citizens and subjects of Italy and this country. lily Lords, however, hope that it will oe possible to take suitable and timely action to present the Italians from establishing themselves on the Islands. 4.

I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office, S.W.l.: - ^ J Note by Ur. Rumbold 'on the H*nish Islands. The Honish Islands are Jebel Zukur, Great Hanish &gt; and Little Heuiish. They are situated in the middle of the lower Red Sea. Great Hanish Island is absolutely m tne middle of the Red Sea, but the other two islands are clearly closer to the Yemen than to Gritrea. The islands appear to be barren and to have no regular inhabitants. They are visited by fishermen from both shores of the Red Sea. Before the war they were Turkish and were occupied on 8th June, 1915, by Indian troops, because it ms feared that they might be occupied by the Italians. One company was maintained on the islands as a garrison unoil 30th August, 1915, when it was withdrawn, largely because the islands were unhealthy and there was difficulty in provisioning them. Arrangements were made for the continuous flying of the Union Jack on the islands after evacuation. Under Article 16 of the Treaty of Lausanne, Turkey renounced sovereignty over the territories and islands situated outside the frontiers laid down in the Treaty, the future of these islands and territories to be settled 'by the parties” concerned. Nothing further has transpired about the future of the Hanish Islands. The three lighthouse islands of Abu Ail, Jebel Teir and Jebel Zubeir are in an analogous position. From 1914 to 1928 the lighthouses were administered by the Men authorities, but an agreement was negotiated last winter by which a Frencn lighthouse coispany, which had certain pre-war claims over the lighthouses, was entrusted with their administration, dues being collected from shipping usin^, tne lighos. At the instance of the Italian Government can article was inserted m the Convention to the effect thatn2 ) 'Nothing in this Convention shall be regarded as constituting a settlement of the future of these islands or territories referred to in Article 16 of the Treaty of Lausanne, or as prejudicing the conclusion of any such settlement in the future.' This, the Italians presumed, 'will in the future be the object of examination on the part of the British and Italian Governments - the parties most interested in the question of the territorial ownership of the three islands.'

My dear Ambassador, I have the honour to transmit to Your Excellency the enclosed memorandum, containing the reply of the Royal Italian Governnent to His Britannic Majesty f s Government, relative to the convention for settling the method of controlling certain lighthouses in the Red Sea. I am sure that you will observe with satisfaction that the Italian point of view corresponds almost exactly with that expressed by His Britannic Majesty’s Government on this question; and I seize the occasion to renew to you, ray dear Ambassador the expression of my highest consideration. (Signed) GRAEDI•i -x. Translation \')T MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS. No.260745/238. PRO MEMORIA. \ i The Royal Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in acknowledging the receipt of His Britannic Majesty’s Embassy Pro-Memoria No.437/ll/28 of the 1st instant, relative to the Red Sea lighthouses, have the honour to thank the British Government for the information furnished in connection with the negotiations with the French Compaiy of lighthouses of the ex-Ottoman Empire, undertaken with a view to settling the question of the administration of the lighthouses in the Red Sea, in a manner satisfactoiy to the States interested in Maritime traffic in that sea. 2. The Royal Government are happy to take notice of the statements in regard to the question of sovereignty over the islands of the Red Sea on which the lighthouses are situated: a question which the proposed convention with the French Company in no way prejudices and which therefore remains reserved and will in the future be the object of examination on the part of the British and Italian Governments, the parties most interested in the question of the territorial ownership of the three islands. The Royal Government fully approve, therefore, the heading of Article 15 which it has been proposed should be added to the Convention itself. 3. The Royal Government are grateful to the British Goverment for being- prepared to meet their wishes as regards the Lighthouse of Mocha, by accepting the proposed modifications of the preamble (paragraph 5 ) and the proposed additionto Article 10 of the Convention.4* The Royal Government wish however to inform His Britannic Majesty* s Embassy that they would find no difficulty, if in course of time it might be considered desirable, in approaching the Imam of Yemen, with a view to persuading him to settle the management of the lighthouse of Mocha direct with the French Compary. 5. As a result of the detailed information vtfii ch His Britannic Majesty * s Government were good enough to furnish, with reference particularly to the difficulties which might be met if it were desired to obtain from the French Company more favourable conditions as regards the annual amount to be paid, the Royal Government, (whilst supporting the view of their technical experts, based on the estimate of the expenses incurred in this connection as regards the cost to the Italian State of maintaining the lighthouses of the Italian colonies in the Red Sea, that the sum fixed might be reduced) do not intend to offer further objections, and declare themselves prepared to accept the proposal that a sum of £ 11,000 sterling for the first year of the provisional regime should be paid to the Company by the interested States. 6 . The Royal Government agree with the British Government as regards the delay and the difficulties which would be met if the negotiations with the Company of Ottoman lighthouses were undertaken directly by the interested Governments, and that it would therefore be advisable for the President of the Board of Trade, in view of the fact that the British Empire is the ^tate possessing the largest volume of shipping in the maritime traffic of the Red sea, to represent all the interested states and be delegated to negotiate with the Company in connection with the lighthouse duties and the eventual modifications to be made in the Convention#7. The Royal Government consider, however, that - after the first year of the provisional regime - it would be useful (and they trust that His Britannic Majesty 1 s Government agree with them on this point), if, during the negotiating between the President of the Board of Trade and the Company, the interested Governments could be kept informed, through the good offices of the Foreign Office, of such negotiations, so that they might offer any suitable suggestions and express such wishes and proposals as most correspond to the particular aims of their own navigation. / 8 . The Royal Government are, therefore, happy to inform His Britannic Majesty 1 s Government that they are ready to sign the Convention, modified in accordance with the proposals made by the Embassy in their pro-memoria of Hovember 1 st, to which they have the honour to reply, and they await therefore a further communication ffom His Britannic Majesty 1 s Government.

(437/6/28). August 28th, 1928. My Lord, I called yesterday afternoon at his request on Signor Guariglia, the Director-General of Political and Commercial Affairs for Europe and the Levant at the Palazzo Chigi , who told me that he desired to make to me a friendly, verbal communications with regard to the Red Sea lighthouses, instead of replying in the form of an official written note to that which His Majesty’s Embassy had addressed to the Italian Government in compliance with tie instructions contained in Sir Austen Chamberlain’s despatch No.739 (E. 2925/73/91) of June 12th last. The observations which the Italian Government desired to make with regard to the proposed Convention were, he begged me to note, conceived in the friendliest spirit; but frankness made for durable friendships, and the Italian Government consequently did not hesitate to let us know what were their first impressions of this Convention, which they were nevertheless prepared to examine in the most friendly manner. 2. To begin with he wished to draw ray attention to the fact that, despite the great interest taken by the Italian Government in everything to do with the Red Sea, this Convention had been drafted as the result of discussions a deux between the British and French Governments, whilst the Italian Government was only asked afterwards to accede to it together with a number of other Governments. I pointed out that, as the British Government was actually providing for the lighting of the islands and they desired to hand these duties over to a French Company, it was only natural that these negotiations, which even them had been difficult, should in the first place be conducted between France and Great Britain; out he said that Italy too would have been willing to discuss the handing over of the duties in question to this French Company. The Rt.Hon.Lord Cushendun, Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. 33. But the chief matter with regard to which he desired to speak to me was concerning the sovereignty over the islands in question# What were the views of His Majesty's (tovemrnent with regard to their future status? Great Britain and Italy had establish- _ed a practice of exchanging views with regard to matter affecting whe Red Sea region and the Italian Government would like an exchange of views with regard to this po±i. Were we of opinion, for instance, that the sovereignty should be attributed to the territorial sovereign of the neighbouring coast; or did we merely wish to reserve the question of sovereignty? In the latter case they would like this put on record, so that there could be no misunderstanding as ta the situation when the islands were being used by the agents of a French Company, 4. Signor Guariglia went on to point out that in the preamble to the draft Convention it was stated:- (1) That the Ottoman Light House Company had constructed and maintained certain lights, including one at Mocha; (2) that Turkey had renounced all her rights and titles over the islands in question and over the territory of Mocha, the future of the islands and of the territory of Mocha remaining a matter for settlement by the parties concerned; (3) that no agreement on this subject had been come to among the parties concerned; and (4) that it was desirable to facilitate navigation by suitable lighting in the neighbourhood of Mocha, how Italy was in a differ ent position to the other Powers in this matter. The Imam of the Yemen considered Mocha to be part of his dominions, and he had been recognised by Italy. It was therefore impossible for the Italian Government to be a party to a treaty referring to Mocha in the manner described above unless the Imam of the Yemen was also invited to be a party. Would it not be possibly to eliminate all reference to Mocha? ’/ith regard to Article 3 of the Agreement between the Board of Trade and the Administration Generale des Phares de 1 'ex-Empire Ottoman, Signor Guariglia said that the Italian technical expertswho had looked into the matter considered the payment of £ 11,000 a year somewhat excessive. They calculated that a maximum payment of £6,600 a year ought to suffice and still leave the Company a profit of 40/£, i.e. 40^ on any capital employed in this part of the Cc pany’s activities. 6 . The last point mentioned to me by Signor Guariglia was that the Italian Government considered that the interested Powers should participate in fixing the amount of the dues to be collected under the arrangement to be come to after the first year. This, he explained, meant that the Italian Government wished the Board of i'rade to be replaced for the purpose of the negotiations contemplated in Article 6 of the Convention by representatives of the Powers inters sted. 7. In conclusion Signor Guariglia assured me that the Italian Government did not want to make any unnecessary difficulties; and he expressed the hope that if we could see our way to meet their wishes with regard to the points mentioned above, which had revealed themselves as the result of a preliminary study of the Convention, they would find themselves able to accept it. I have etc. ( Sgd) CHARLES WHT GFIELDCompany’ s claim, but were the only Power in a position to exercise any pressure on the Company. It was, moreover, impossible to reach any agreement with the Company until a draft convention for the future maintenance of the lighthouses had been prepared. Had further parties been introduced into the negotiations at this stage, however, the negotiations, which were more than once on the verge of breaking down, would necessarily have been renderednore compli cated, and it is probable that the necessary agreement with the Company would have been much delayed. 3 . I understand from Mr.Wingfield’s despatch No.644 that the question to which the Italian Government attach most importance is that of the ultimate sovereignty over the islands. It appears to His Majesty’s Government that this question is already covered by Recitals 3 and 4 in the Preamble, and by Article 13 in the bo&lt;V of the draft Convention. These provisions were intended to make it clear that there was no intention to attribute the sovereignty over the islands to the territorial sovereign of the neighbouring coast, and that the intention of the signatories was that the question of sovereignty should be reserved. 4. As the Italian Government will readily understand, there are obvious objections to the introduction of any change into the text of the Convention at the present stage. The text, which has only been arrived at after protracted and difficult negotiations, had been communicated to all the Governments concerned, and, if any modification^, even of a minor character, is now introduced as the result of a request from one Power, apart from the serious and costly delay which may be involved, other Powers may be encouraged to put forward corresponding requests which may prove difficult to deal with and which might even lead to a re-opening of the entire nego- tiations. 5. Notwithstanding these objections, however, His Majesty’s Government would be prepared, if the Italian Government press their point, to consider t’^.e introduction of certain minor modifications in the Convention to meet the Italian views. They would further be prepared to suggest the introduction of modifications in the£900 Convention in to the question of Mocha, since they recognise that, Mocha being in fact under the rule of the Imam of the Yemen, with whom Italy is in treaty relations, there is some force in the Italian contention that it would be difficult for Italy to become a party to a Convention which specifically refers to the status of Mocha as being still indeterminate* As you will see from the board of Trade letter enclosed herein, there are objections to the complete omission of any reference to Mocha in the Preamble of the Convention but there seems no reason why the Italian Governments objections should not be overcome by the introduction of suitable modifications in the relevant portions of the text. 6 . I accordingly enclose herein the text of three draft modifica tions, the introduction of which into the Convention His Majesty's Government would be prepared to propose to the other Powers concerned, if the Italian Government so desire. These draft modifications should, in my opinion, completely meet the points raised by Signor Guariglia in regard to the question of the sovereignty of the islands, the status of Mocha and the position of the Imam, and I shall be glad if you will endeavour to obtain the agreement of the Italian Government to them as soon as possible. 7. As regards the remaining two points raised by Signor Guariglia regarding the provisions of the Convention, His Majesty's Government regret that they cannot see their way to meeting the Italian point of view. In regard to the first of these points, i.e. the yearly amount to be paid to the French Company during the provisional regime, Your Excellency should explain that this figure, which has always been regarded as reasonable, was fixed on the basis of the average annual expenditure actually incurred by His Majesty's Treasury on the maintenance of the three island lighthouses during the five years immediately preceding 1927, plus an allowance of twelve and a half per cent for profit, and a sum of nine hundred pounds a year representing a fair share of the expenditure incurred by the French Company in respect of their head office expenses in Paris and Constantinople. The Italian Government give no indication of the date on which their experts base their figure of six thousand six hundred pounds a year, but it is possible that they mayZo3) may not have made adequate allowance for the expense of the monthly reliefs, which require the service of a steamer with sea-going qualities* Moreover they may not have taken into account the pay for the lighthouse keepers, which must be sufficient to induce them to ''Remain employed in exceptionally incongenial surroundings on terms which do not include a right to pension. Lastly, I am informed that for climatic and other reasons frequent leave of absence for the keepers is necessary, and that free passages for steamer from Aden to Europe have had to be allotted to them after twelve months’ duty, thus involving the employment of a. larger staff than would be necessary for similar lighthouses in a temperate climate. In any £ 11 , 000 .case the figure of eleven thousand pounds has only been agreed upon with the Company after much difficult and arduous negotiation, and it is clear that any attempt to reduce it at this stage would only result in a complete breakdown of the negotiations. 8 . The final suggestion put forward by Signor Guariglia,which is dealt with in paragraph 6 of Mr. Wingfield’s despatch ITo.644 appears to His Majesty’s Government to be open to equally serious objection. Negotiations between a single body and the Company for the establishment of a provisional regime have already proved a matter of extreme difficulty. It is clear that it would be altogether impossible to carry on negotiations with the Company for the establishment of a permanent regime with the slightest hope of success, if they were to be conducted with the Company, as suggested by the Italian Government, by the representatives of at least seven Powers. The Chief reason which led to the selection of the President of the Board of Trade to be representative of the interested lowers is that given in Article 6 of the Convention, viz. that he will set as a representative of the Power which now possesses the largest volume of merchant shipping trafficking in the Rea Sea. The practical objections to any alteration of this provision are. however, so overwhelming, that His Majesty’s Government find it difficult to believe that the Italian Government will persist in their objectionsobjections on this point when the facts are fully before then* I shall therefore be glad if Your Excellency will explain the position to them, both on this point and on that dealt with in the preceding paragraph in the sense indicated above, and express the earnest hope that they will withdraw their objectiond. I am, etc. (Sgd) MONTEAGLE•Copy. (3 4796/73/91) .12333/28. jSRCjUITILS BIRINS DSPAHTiaSUT, z 3 BGxiRD OF TRiiDS, 20, Great Smith Street, Westminster, S.W. 1. 2nd October, 1928. Sir, With reference to your letter of the 22nd September (No. E 4375/73/91) relative to the pro-posed Convention for the maintenance of certain lighthouses in the Red Sea, I am directed by the Board of Trade to state, for the information of Lord Cushendun, that they desire to offer the following observations on the views expressed by the Italian Ministry for Foreign Affairs, and on the proposals for meeting them which are outlined in your letter. On the first point raised by Monsieur Guanglia regarding the action of His Majesty’s Government in coming to a prior agreement with the French Government and with the Ligjithouse Company without inviting the Italian Government to take part in the negotiations, the Board agree that the reply given by Mr. Wingfield deals adequately with the matter, and they concur in the proposal of the Acting Secretary of State to take no further action on this point beyond approving Mr. Wingfield’s representations. On the second point, which relates to sovereignty over tine three Red Sea islands mentioned in the Convention, I am to state that, while the Board hesitate to express any definite opinion on this question, #iich is primarily one for the Foreign Office to consider, they are disposed to agree that, althougji the recitals 3 and 4 of the Preamble to the Convention, and article 13 in the body of the Convention, seem sufficiently clear, it mijit be desirable The Under Secretary of State, to/ Foreigi Office, s.W. ito endeavour to dispose of this point by the insertion of a sentence at the end of article 13 making the matter clear beyond any possible doubt. It is observed that Mr. V/ingfield was informed that this was the chief point of objection of the Italian Govemment. As regards the references to Mocha in recitals 3 and 4 of Hie Preamble, it appears to the Board that any proposal to omit these references entirely may meet with opposition from the French Government, seeing that the references follow a recital of facts relating to the concession of the Lighthouse Company who attached great importance to the terms of this recital, moreover the omission of the reference to Mocha in recital 4 might be particularly objectionable to the Company as indicating to their minds that their operations in the Red Sea under Part II of the Convention would be strictly confined to the management of the three island lighthouses. There is the further point that a light near Mocha is very desirable and should be included in the terms of the Convention. In order to avoid the re-opening of questions vhich were settled with the French Govemment and the Company only after much difficulty, it seems preferable to adopt the course suggested in paragraph 7 of your letter, viz., to re-craft trie relevant provisions so as to avoid any implication that the ownership of the territory of Mocha is still open to settlement. is regards trie possible intervention of the Imam of the Yemen in connection with any arrangement for including in the permanent system a scheme of lighting in the nei^abourhood of Mocha, the Acting Secretary of State is aware that it was proposed to meet the requirements of navigation in that nei^ibourhood by the placing of a limited buoy in a position about five miles from the coast of the Yemen/Yemen. The Board have reason to think that such an arrangement would be acceptable to the British shipping interests as an alternative to trie relighting of Locna lighthouse. This arran 0 ement was in contemplation when the drafting of the fourth recital in the Preamble to tne Convention was finally settled, hence the decision to insert in that recital the words 'and to facilitate navigation by suitable lighting in neighbourhood of Mocha'. It was then anticipated that the placing of a buoy in such a position under international arrangements would avoid any difficulty with the Imam. As regards the two remaining points dealt with in Mr, Wingfield’s despatch the Board share the views of tne Acting Secretary of State as to the impossibility of making any alteration to meet the views of the Italian Government, and they concur in the instructions proposed to be given to Mr. Wingfield on these points.

It documents concerns held by the British Government that the Italian Government is in the process of attempting to establish some kind of informal control over certain islands.Matters discussed in the correspondence include:The content and wording of a proposed Red Sea Lights Convention, the result of negotiations between the British and French governments, which ostensibly relates to the construction and maintenance of lighthouses – both on islands in the Lower Red Sea and in the territory of Mocha – but also concerns questions of sovereignty.Whether the Italian Government's plan to construct a lighthouse on South-West Haycock Island constitutes a claim of sovereignty over the island.The establishment of Italian military posts on the Hanish and Jebel Zukur [Jazīrat Jabal Zuqar] islands.Concerns expressed by the Admiralty and Foreign Office that by establishing these posts the Italian Government could be attempting to enforce rights of sovereignty over the islands.The extent to which either the Treaty of Lausanne (1923) or the Rome Conversations of 1927 (between Britain and Italy) provide any basis to contesting an Italian claim to sovereignty over the islands.Reports of attempts by the Italian military posts to restrict fishing and pearling in neighbouring waters to dhows possessing a permit from Assab.The file features the following principal correspondents: His Majesty's Ambassador in Rome (Sir Ronald Graham, succeeded by James Eric Drummond); the Command-in-Chief, Mediterranean; the Senior Officer of the Red Sea Sloops; the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs; officials of the Foreign Office, the Colonial Office, the India Office, the Admiralty, the Air Council, and the Board of Trade's Mercantile Marine Department.As well as correspondence the file includes the following: extracts from reports of the proceedings of HMS

                           Calcutta(1934); copies of the minutes of an interdepartmental conference, held at the Foreign Office on 6 July 1931 to consider questions relating to the Red Sea islands; draft English and French texts of modifications to the aforementioned Red Sea Lights Convention, prepared by Sir Cecil Hurst, legal adviser to the Foreign Office; two sketch maps depicting the Lower Red Sea islands and surrounding area.In addition to the aforementioned French text, the file contains some material in Italian, namely a copy of a fishing permit issued at Assab (an English translation is included).The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year.
