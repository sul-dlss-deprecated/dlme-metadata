Lt, '■ Col *, I .A. Ag: Civil Commissioner in Mesopotamia, 1*1 ^jGKotea of a conversation between The Secretary of state for Foreign Affairs, and the Arab Mission representing the E.lr Ibn Saud. 26th.Hovsirber 191©. The Secretary of State received Peisal Ibn Saud and Ahmad - ibn- T bona i y an at the Foreign Office on woverober 26th. 1919. After customary frreetinrs had been exchanged, the Secretary of State said that he proposed to review the general situation between King Hussein and Ibn Saud before replying in detail to the requests presented on the 1st. November in a Hote read to the India Office and Boreign Office Joint Conference. Kis Majesty's Government were well aware that Ibn Saud was one of the great Independent Rulers of Arabia; he was their friend and they had entered into Treaty engagements with him. They were earnestly desirous that the friendly relations established in this Treaty should be maintained. During the past year Ibn Saud had come into con flict with another of the friends of His Majesty's Government, - His Highness Sherif Hussein, the King of the Hedjaz. Without goinr into the merits of the con troversy, he wished to make it clear that this was a state of affairs which His Majesty's Government could not view with equanimity. They were desirous of seein* the principles of cohesion and unity replace separation and discord in Arabian politics, and the first essential to the attainment of this object was that the two greatest Independent Rulers of Arabia should live at peace with one another. His Majesty's Government were delirhted to welcome Ibn Saud's son, and the Mission which had accompanied him to England, but so long as the pain issues between IbnI b n Saud and King Hu SS eln regained undecided they were not prepared to give apeoiflo ane.ere to euoh question, ae those preaented by the Arab ul 8 Bion on the let. Kovaraber. The outbreak of hostilitiee between theee t»» rulers had caused considerable disquiet to His Uajesty's Government, who had riven careful thourht to the iseans by which they could be instrumental in brinr- ing it to an and. In the month of June the position had been that Ibn Saud was in possession of Khurma and Turaba, and had suooessfully resisted two attempts by Kin* Hussein to reassert his authority in those places. His Majesty's Government had despatched Mr. Philby by air with the intention that he should make his way to Ibn Saud, and propose to him that hostilities should cease pending a settlement of the dispute by a British Commission. One of the conditions which was to have been made by Mr. Philby was that Ibn Saud should withdraw his forces at least from Turaba, and that a strip of country should be left unoccupied between the contending armies. Ibn Saud had, however, in the meantime, received a pre vious message from His Majesty's Government which had induced him to suspend hostilities and return to Riadh. Mr. philby was accordingly unable to deliver the message of His Majesty's Government and Ibn Saud had remained in possession of Khurma and Turaba ever since. He wished the Mission to understand clearly that on the evidence before them. His Majesty's Government were inclined to accept King Hussein's contention that he was the rirhtful owner not only of Turaba, to which hie claim appeared indisputable, but a.lso of Khurma: but It was im-noasible for them to make a definite decision on points of detail from this distance. They had been quite ready to appoint a Boundary Oommission if this had teen the desire of both parties. Ibn Saud had always agreed to this solution, but Kinf: Hussein had objected. Eis /Hia majesty's Government were now of opinion that the beat way of aettlini; the dispute between the two rtalere was that they should meet personally and tallr matters over, either at Jeddah or possibly at some other place. They bad accordingly suggested to King Hussein that this should be done, and he would be glad to know how Ibn Saud would be likely to view a similar proposal# Ahmed-ibn-Thunaiyan replied that he had no doubt that Ibn Saud would welcome a meeting with King Hussein himself, but he was not authorised to give an under taking to this effect, nor could he say anything as to the place of meeting# Ibn Saud would not agree to meet any representative of King Hussein, though he might depute a representative in the event of a personal inter view between the two rulers being impracticable, i The Secretary of State remarked that, so far as he knew. King Hussein had never refused to meet Ibn Saud. He had, however, definitely refused to accept arbitra tion by a British Commission on the question of Khurma. The intention of His Majesty^ Government was that a meeting should now be brought about between the two rulers for a frank discussion of all points at issue between them. This was what he might call the first step of the negotiations. It was hoped that such a meeting would result in general agreement? if, however, it turned out that the two parties were unable to arree. His Majesty t s Government suggested that the second step should be the intervention of an impartial British official who would endeavour to decide such points as remained in dispute. He asked whether Ibn Saud would agree to this second step. Ahmed-ibn-Thunalyan again pointed out that he had no authority to give a definite answer, but his personal opinion was that Ibn Saud would accept arbit ration by an Impartial British, official, provided that King Hussein agreed equally to be bound by that offic ials deoision.The Secretary of State said that Fla Majeety's Government wouad of course ra a*e It a condition that both parties should accept without question the decision of the arbitrator, and that unless both parties agreed to this the proposal would fall to the ground. Ahmad-ibn-Thunalyan enquired whether His Majesty's Government would guarantee both parties against an infringement by the other party of the arreement arrived at. The Secretary of State replied that His Majesty's Government oould not undertake this until they saw the agreement, hut that they would he glad to accept any reasonable agreement arrived at by the two parties, and would use their influence to restrain either party from infringing it in future. He went on to say that the appointment of a Boundary Oommission, which he might call the third step in the negotiations, would present no difficulty if the first two stages had been successfully negotiated, nor would it be necessary at all if, as he himself hoped, it was found that the first stage would be sufficient. He thought that what he had said provided an answer to most of the points raised in the Mission's note of the 1st November. At Ahmad-ibn-Thunaiyan's request, however, he dealt with them seriatim ; The answer to So.l he expressed soise surprise that Ibn Saud should demand the ratification of the Treaty entered into by His Majesty's Government. There was, so far as he knew, no term set to the Treaty, and in these circumstances there did not appear to be any necessity for its renewal. With regard to !fo. 2 His Majesty's Government did not propose to discuss the disputed boundary with either party. They sincerely hoped that a meetinr would result in an agreement being arrived at. As to Ho.5 the question of an embargo on pilgrims from Hejd appeared to him to depend entirelyon the relations between the two rulers. If, a3 h, hoped before the next pllcri^e season ooaMenoed, they had found a solution to their differences, the question would not arise. In answer to Ho.4 he must disclaim any liability on the part of His Majesty'3 Government to rehabilitate the territories of Ibn Saud from damages which extended over the past fifty years. He did not consider that it was a suitable moment to discuss the enhancement of his subsidy at a time when he was not on friendly terms with a friend and ally of His Majesty's Government. fie did not quite understand the last surest ion that Mr. Philfey should be despatched to Ibn Saud as Political Agent empowered for the solvinr of the bound ary question and other kindred problems in as much as the proposals now put forward by His Majesty's Government would, be hoped, result in all these problems beinr solved without British intervention. With regard to the attacbment of a British official to the Mission for its return journy, this was a matter which would, he understood, be arranged by the India Office to whom he would not fail to represent the Mission's wishes. In conclusion he impressed upon Peisal-ibn-Saud, and upon Ahmad -1 bn- T huna i y an the paramount necessity of Ibn Saud's establishing friendly relations with the King of the Hejas. This was tbe most important point, and all questions of detail should be made subordinate to it.CONFIDENTIAL No.- y[-4. Political Agency, Bahrain.
