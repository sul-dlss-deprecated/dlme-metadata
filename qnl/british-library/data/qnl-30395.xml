His father, Jaiyid Tsiaur, though a pleasant enough personality, was averse to work and responsibility and for a number of years had been an absentee baler refusing to visit his atste. This being •o sene arrangements for Managing the affairs of the State had to be devised. A Council of Regency was famed consist* ing of local notables at the head of which was placed Bertram Thonao, of exploration fame, then financial Adviser to the iuacat Government. Thames in the Counoil had the title of 3aslr, and he and the Political Agent between then fomed the government of the Jtste to all intents and purposes. 3. Finally in 1933 about 3 years after I had succeeded urphy as Political /.gent, : usoat, oaiyid taianr insisted on abdicating, and the present Ailtan came to the throne «o a about 23, Ho bad a difficult position to fill. Thomas, while he had done the politics 1 side of his work soil enouf'h, had neglected the met er of finances, and the State was practically bankrupt. There wore alec of tribal unrest in various parte of the f'uaoat ter itorlea.

Hamad climbed down* was aada ( ' V *H of iittra, wharo he could be under the eye of the Julian* 1 end since then the 'wicked uncles* have been well under control* 4* The sultan else eet about the reorganisation of the State finances with zeal and not a little akin . he has quite a flair for finance* and assist d by Biscoc and ay self brought the utate off the rocks. It is now financial}y in a comparatively flourishing condition. The sultan is duly grateful for this assistance and has, I think* s genuine personal liking for me* which I certainly reciprocate* dating ffoo the time when 1 was Political Agent at his State and we went through some difficult times together. At the same tl 1 ,^ tp : act t: ui t “ as explained in paragraph 8 above «. the state for some years was unavoidably run under British administration has made him all the more sensitive in the matter of British control* This attitude is only to be expected. The independence of me* 11 states is very mn»i. in the sir these days end the Sultan naturally enough has those I' is&lt;w&gt;o as w«o ** Balers. To put the matter briefly J he wants to run his own shew* and we will have to humour him |j to some extent and, generally speaking, rids him on the || snaffle. The fact thr.t he has asked for tho revision of his 'rwaty/ ?Treaty Indicates the my his ■Ind Is »ovlng, and the further ftect that - unlike the other iitates to the Oulf - his state Is tote;•nationally independent, (he can have foreign representatives at 'uaoet If he likes - at one time there used to be AsMrioan and French Consuls there - and could send repreeentativee abroad If he could afford then), ■akaahla position s strong one. 5. As will appear from ay suanary of hla history the Sultan has various sound quantises he la shrewd and anargetia, with a flair for finance, and baa a will of hla own. Ha has a pleasant personality, though vary abort to stature (about &amp;«3) bears himself with considerable dignity, end la endowed • I mi glad to say - with a quiet sense of humour, Milch lightens the despatch of official business. He speaks excellent English, which he learnt at the Chiefs' College, Ajmere, where he was for some tine. He Is - as hlscoa pointed out to one of his letters - rather e lonely figure. His uncles, Mica he would ordinarily consort with, are distinctly inferior to him to intelligence (with the exception of Hamad already mentioned) and ha has little to conaon with them. It would bo an excellent thing if he married some educated Arab girl of good family - at present he has various concubines - one or two to Huoeat and cm or two to Shofar, but no wife. The difficulty la that there is negro blood to the iaiyid family, and the other Sulin# families to the Oulf e. . the A1 Khalifah of Bahrain, and the teibah of Kuwait, will not give one of their women to marriage to the Ktoscat Haling fanily. X imagine the /grab families of Iraq, Syria ate. would fool the same. fe. Having so far given the Sultan a good ’'confidential'I suppose 1 ought to put in something on the other side* He is extremely obstinate and once he has got an idea into his head it is very difficult to get it out again* Also whilst fully alive to the value of assistance from His Majesty's ^overament (which has been forthcoming on various occasions in various ways, he is by no means too ready to reciprocate when his co-operation Is needed by uat instances of this have occurred of late* Further f having worked very hard at first at putting his Htate in order now that the State la solvent he has slacked off t and - aa you are aware - has spent ouch of his time at !£*ofar t an inaccessible area quite out of touch with his Capital and the rest of his territory* Dhofar, about half-way between - useat and Aden f is the most fertile district in the Sultan*e dominions, and has the best climate, and Watts, who has visited it a couple of times by Hoyal Air Force plane, inferae me that the Sultan has effected | many improvements there* buildings, gardens etc* This of course is all to the good,end X certainly don't blame the Sultan for wishing to have a pleasant country aaat to which he can retreat at intervals from the lluseat hot weather and the attentions of the Political Agent and the Resident* But unfortunately th* 3ult*n'0 hav b~n extremely prolonged, the la.t | one, from which he emex^ged in farch last, having extended to about 1£ years* During these retreats nothing really Import ant can be decided at Muscat, and both on bshalf of Government, and personally, 1 have drawn the Multan's attention to the undesirability of those pro Ion ed absences, but I an afraid without much affact sine# next winter he proposes d long tour to Japan, the United States of America and tor ope.

It seems best in view of the Foreign Office practice to omit this from the form of address of letters to the Sultan, if you and the Government of India agree. In that case do you think that it would be desirable to inform the Sultan accordingly ? If so, he might be informed, when you meet him again after his return, that on the Foreign Office being consulted on the point raised by him it was ascertained that there would be nothing inconsistent with the usual practice in omitting the letters of British decorations after his name from the form of address in The JJ^n’ble Li .t.Colonel Sir Trenchard Fowle, KCIS., C3E., H.B.M.’s Consulate-General, Bushire. communications/2 . communications addressed to him, and that we will accordingly act in accordance with his wishes on the point.

Perhaps we need not take this casual renark too seriously - at any rate nu&amp;X unless he raises the matter again, and it might be undesirable to adopt any other form of address. There is, however, another point which he raised on the same occasion. He said that, though he greatly esteemed the honour of the K.C.I.E. and would treasure it ail his life, he did not think it fitting that the letters should be added after his name. It was suggested to him that it would be hardly appropriate that an official communication from Government should omit the customary indication of nn honour conferred by His Majesty. We understand from the Foreign Office, however, th^t this view is unsound and that it would be contrary to diplomatic practice, in the case of an independent Ruler, to insert the letters of a British decoration in the form of address. There would therefore be no formal objection to acceding to the Sultan’s wish regarding the omission of the M K.C.I.3.'CONFIDENTIAL.

It is my firm conviction tn&amp;t the Araor, have taken f .11 advantage of the recent visits to Indi j i of H.H.Prince Baud of Saudi Arabia and H.H. The Sultan of a scat. The Arab merchants ara aware that the Grovemment of India extend to ti ese r .lers the privilege of exemption from Customs duty and of examination of their oag asre.

We had inforfnation that by this means no less than DO,000-60,000 sovereigns, if not more were exported by sea and air from Bombay aud Karachi in the baggage belonging to H.H.Prince Saud. The matter was ur^u^ht to tne Board’s notice some days prior to the Prince's departure from India but we received instructions not to interfere on any account. It is a natter for con lecture whetrier tne departure of H.H. Tee Sultan of nscat was also exploited in tais manner. It is my opinion that tnoso rulers were influenced or are oeing influenced by certain Arab merchants to pay the visits to India as a means of serving their own ends. The local rate of a sovereign fluctuates between Rs.28- 32 whereas at Basrah, Baghdad etc. it is 3s.38- 42.

Sir, X have the honour to refer to the correspondence ending with your telegram No« 707 dated October 11th, 1940* 2. At an interview with the Sultan on the 14th of October X discussed with him the question of his successor. His Highness was inclined to treat the question in a rather im personal way due no doubt to the fact that at present he has no male heir and has no particular affection for any single member of his family. The Sultan considered that in the interests of both A His Majesty's Government and the State his successor should hold the same views as his own with regard to the State's close connection with His Majesty's Government,and should be personally acceptable to the majority of the people. In his opinion it would be necessary to consider the claims of his uncles Saiyid Nadir bln Faisal 9 Saiyid Hemal bin Faisal, Saiyid Shahab bin Faisal, who is at present Minister for External Affairs, and his half brother T&amp;rifc bln Taimur. He did not think that any of his other relatives were worthy of consideration nor would they, in his opinion, put forward any claim • I asked if his eldest half brother, Saiyid Majid bin Taiaur would have any claim / but while&lt;£&gt; Wt whilo not directly answering aay question in the negative the Sultan said that he eould never suggest that Saiyid Nejid should succeed hisi as he considered Saiyid Majid most unsuit idle* In rsgard to the four persons *rhosi he had named the Sultan said that unfortunately not one of the® fulfilled the two conditions that he had suggested should be fulfilled by his successor* Hie uncle Saiyid Tfadir had* he considered| lost his influence with 'ha people and was incapable of taking part in affairs of dtate owing to hie indifferent health. His uncle Oaiyid Kainau bin Faisal would be a very bad choice as although| owing to his pleasant inarmei s, he was liked by persons who had no close acquaintance with him} he was unreliable} avaricious} intriguing and was not stable in his political outlook* at times professing to be pro-British and at others undoubtedly the reverse Saiyid Tarik bin Taimur had not outgrown his early upbringing} he was at school in Turkey and Germany} ana o,X . . ugh this was in the Sultan 1 s view a sufficient reason to disqualify him froa further consideration. Saiyid Shahab bin Faisal} His Hi«£mess , e junior uncle and full brother of His Highness’s father £aiyid Taimur bin Faisal} was definitely pro-British and thus fulfilled one of the conditions but said the Cult an he was unpopular with the people. His unpopularity was due to his quick temper and consequent harsh acts which provoked resentment but in spite of this disadvantage Saiyid Shahab was in the Sultan’s opinion the most suitable person to succeed him. His Highness gave me the Impression that though Saiyid Shahab was by no means an ideal choice he was the best that could be made in the circumstance. The Sultan pointed out that in addition to his pronounced pro-British feelings Saiyid Shahab would 9 as the principal minister of State f be in a position to establish himself immediately in the event of his 9 the Sultan’s} sudden demise as he would be in control and would be able to use bis authority to ensure that his rivals were not / in a positionIn a position to offor any serious opposition* During the course of the interview the Sultan never once suggested that tuny recognition private or public should ba accorded to Saiyid Shahab bin Faisal as his successor by His Majesty's (Government and I do not consider that any such recog nition would at the present tima be in accordance with the Ruler's own wishes. At the end of our discussion on this subject His High ness mentioned that he had recently received letters from Dhofar and that in consequence of the news contained in them he might possibly wish to make a further statement on this subject in the near future. The Sultan visited his southern province in April of this year and has a wife living there. 3. The future is doubtful f the Sultan may have a son, an event which will probably change hi© whole outlook, or in the course of two or three years Saiyid Tarik bin Taimur may develop into an ideal successor, but for the time being I consider that Saiyid Shahab bln Faisal is the most suitable choice and should be looked upon as the future Sultan. The history of UAiscat shows that during the last hund red years the normal procedure has been for the ruling Sultan to Indicate his successor before his own death. fosetlmes the Ruler has shown his preference for a particular son or relative by his actions and sometimes he has made a pronouncement but in the turbulent history of the country there are many instances of the desires and intentions of the ruler being disregarded after his death. 4ore often than not in the past it has been the moat powerful relative who has succeeded in establishing himself and this is what will probably happen in the future. tfhile the procedure remains much the same as it has always done there has been a change in the source cfroa which the claimant draws his strength. In the old days a claimant who cowkanded a large following in the country and exerted the / most4 moat influence over the tribes of Oasn was generally able to establish himself and hold his position as Sultan until his death y which was some tines untimely, but the increase in the influence of His Jiujesty's Government and the election by the Omani tribes of a separate leader, the Imam, has reduced the value of tribal support and increased the strength that the claimant has derived from his close association with and good intentions towards His Majesty's Government so that today the actual succession will be largely determined by the expressed or presumed favour with which the claim of a particular individual is looked upon by His Majesty*8 Government* Therefore while 1 do not consider it desirable that any recognition should be accorded to Saiyld Shahab as the heir pre sumptive, I do suggest that, in order to prevent possible strife, arrangements be made to ensure that provided he accepts the required obligations and agreements recognition as Sultan be accorded immediately on his accession.

OPPIGE. 4th March, 1941. Dear Prior, The Secretary of State has received a letter fro«Mr, R. Said Ruete, who is related to the ruling dynasty in Muscat, reminding him that the present year sees the bicentennial anniversary of The A1 bu Said dynasty. It is reported b^ the Resident in Zanzibar that owing to the war and the pressing need for economy the Sultan of Zanzibar does not propose to celebrate the occasion. The Colonial Office have however under consideration a suggestion that later in the year the king might 'send the S’ ltan a dressage of congratulation and greeting* on 'the anniversary of his Accession Day, and that the opportunity might be tu*ken to incorporate a suitable reference to the bicentenary. There is however some doubt about the relevant date. It is stated in Aitchison, XI, 269, that ^hmad bin Said, the founder of the dynasty, v/as elected Imam in l74i. Loriraer, however, both in the text (p.407) and the genealogical tables, give£ the dcte of the election as 1744* which would postpone the bicentenary for another three years. Can you say which is the date accepted locally and whether the occasion is likely to be celebrated in any way in Muscat? If 1841 is the generally recognised date, have you any suggestion to make as to the manner in which notice of the bicentenary might be taken, if you think it should be taken at all, by the authorities in India or here. In view of the Sultan’s dislike of publicity presumably nothing should be said about the anniversary in the B.B.C.’s Arabic broadcasts. I am sending a copy of this letter t c Oaroe and Hickinbotham. The Hon’ble Political It.Col.C.G.Prior, C1I.E., Resident in the Persian Gulf. Yours sincerely, (S 0 &lt;ff.) R.PEEL.V CONFIDENTIAL. D.O.No. C/511 My dear friend, At our conversation yesterday, you told me that the date of Sayyid Ahmad's election as Imam was 1167 Hijri. I find, on working it out, that this corresponds to A.D. 1754. Is it possible that the date should be 1157 Hijri ? Otherwise, it seems that our friends in Zanzibar are at least ten years out in their reckoning! Your sincere friend, IM- Saiyid Said bin Taimur, of Muscat and Oman.September the 16th 1941 f It appears that it is not possible to trace the correct Hijri date of Saiyid Ahmads election as Imam. Shaikh Abdullah bin Humaid Alsalmi, the author of 'Tuhfat A1 Ayan” gives the year of Ahmad*s Imamate 1167 A.H. while Salil bin RazCiq, the author 6f 'Imams &amp; Saiyids of Oman', which book was translated by Badger, states that Ahmad*s succession to the Imamate took place in A.H.1154 A.D.1741.

The Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. have the honour to refer to your Memorandum No* C/348^on the subject of the Bicentenary of the Al Bu SaJid Dynasty} and to say that the Sultan is himself unable to give me a definite date ^ for the election of Sayyid Ahmad as Imam* 2. M Imams and Sayyids of Oman'* at page 407 certainly gives the date as A*D* 1741| in which case the bicentenary occurred seven years ago - as it must presumably be calculated by Arabic years. I do not, however, personally trust the editor’s equation of Hejira years with Anno Domini, as on page xii of his Introduction he equates A*H. 15 with A.D* 636, A*H* 41 with A.D. 661 ana A.H. 65 with A.D. 684. It seems clear from tills that he puts the Hejira at A.D. 620, or tliree years earlier than it is usually reckoned. If this is so, Lorimer’s date of 1744 is presumably correct, and the bicentenary fell in A.D. 1937 by Arabic years, or will fall in A.D. 194* by Fnglish years. 3. I might aid that another authority, the author of 'Tubfat al Ay an”, gives the year of Ahmad’s Iraamate as A.H. 1167 » A.D. 1754} and this was the date first verbally given / me by Hisme by His Highness* 4* There are not going to be any celebrations locally; but the Sultan has no objection to a mention by the British Broadcasting Corporation of the length of rule of his dynasty.

Ha invited me to dinner and lunch, and took ma out gazelle shooting and to Maznura where he gave me tea. Ha also put £ car at my disposal. Tha proposed duck shoot fall through. 3. On one occasion during conversation ha told ma that ha had racaivad complaints about tha sale and distribution of cloth which, ha said, was causing unrest. Ha said that ha would be vary grateful if I would look into tha matter for him. 4. At another time ha told ma that Saiyid Shahab, tha Minister for External Affairs, was pressing to be permitted to make a personal raport. Tha Sultan was averse to a visit, and asked me if I knew what tha troubla was. X said that 1 did not, but imagined that it was connected with tha high Price Relief Fund v&amp;ich I knew needed adjustment. His Highness decided to write a latter to Saiyid Shahab, and asked me if I would arrange for an air passage for him if ha asked ma later on. Tha Sultan thought, however, that his latter would close tha matter. 5. The Sultan told ma how difficult it was for him to organise a satisfactory form of Government for Muscat while ha was in Dhofar. Ha said that whan ha was present in Muscat ha co-ordinated tha various departments, but in his absence they all worked independently. The Sultan seems to be giving considerable thought to Muscat, and was mere frank than I could have expected. 6. The Sultan made no suggestion of the independence of his State and usad the term 'agency* in conversation and not 'consulate* as, I believe, he often does.

August, 1945 During ft recont converstation with the Sultan, I enquired whether he hod given any thought on the question of hie son** education. He replied that hie Intention wee to norul Qabooe to a eultafcle eohool In Egypt and that he &gt;iad dlecneeed thie matter with King Farouq of hgypt during hie last visit to that country. Qabooe is only six years old and does not appear that any articular Egyptian school has yet been selected.

He said that at Muscat he approached the Sultan and asked for his permis sion tc be allowed to write his letters to the Sultan in English. The Sultan while granting his request told K.B. that he should not address him as ’His Highness' in his com munications as he did not like it. The K.B. accordingly writes his letters to the Sultan in the following form:- 'To The Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Muscat. Respected Sir, Respectfully yours”.. 2. The K.B. further said that the Sultan likes to deal with the Political Agent at Muscat orJ.y in his capacity as 'His Britannic Majesty's Consul at Muscat' and not as a Political Agent. 3.

Dear Sir, Colonel Galloway has proceeded to Bushire on transfer and so I am replying to your letter. I presume you would like the cancellations to be pre-dated and I have enquired whether it could be done. The postal authorities here regret their inability to do this as it is against their regulations. They are, however, willing to cancel the stamps, showing the current date, if this would be of any use to you. Yours truly, Acting British Consul, Muscat. e-l c, NCJP.O. Ho.

Me. C.bOJ, - 8/28 Political kgancy, Muscat* 4th Dacsotbsr 1947* ✓ sT\ In a long private letter the Sultan writes to say that he had expected to leave Dhofar for Muscat towards the end of December 1947, but he feels his presence in Dhofar to be essential during the visit of the Petroleum Concessions Limited geologist 1 a t I n order to make quite sure that everything is arranged to their mutual agreement and satisfaction. He has accordingly delayed his return to Muscat till the end of February or the beginning of March by which time he hopes that everything will have been arranged and he can leave them to start the first stages of their work, with the Wall to look after them for the rest of their stay* He is obviously looking forward with great eagerness and hope to the geological party*s arrival and has apparently been doing a little private exploration on his own part, and writes to say that he has discovered a Mica mine at a place about 16 miles North East of Murbat, easily accessible by oar* 3* He seems to be feeling a little guilty about his delayed return and anxious that the reasons for it should be explained to you, adding that had circumstances permitted he would have liked to visit Bombay before the summer of 1948 to see Doctors and Specialists especially an eye specialist* It is not clear from his letter whether he mentions this with a view to proving that his delayed return has entailed some personal sacrifice on his part or whether by way of preparing the ground for a very early departure from Muscat after his return* 4* I ^yeelf don*t feel too happy about the administration here and would have been glad to see the Sultan return earlier. The Hon'ble Sir Rupert Hay, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Political Resident, Persian Qulf, Bahrain* / I- 2 1 I certainly hope that we shall be able to fet the British Foreign Minister installed before he goes away again. 5* Among business items the Sultan mentions that he has quite a number of matters to discuss with me in connection with the recent changes in India and their effects on him and the State. In connection with the Air Agreement he mentions that he has received his Statement of Accounts up to the 31at October 1947 from Lloyds Bank Limited, London, and no credit is so far shown from His Majesty's Government for rent although he has received the telegram from me saying that the first payment has been made into the Bank. He asks that I should look into this matter. I am doing so and will write to you officially. He also urges once again that steps should be taken soon to appoint a Senior Royal Air Force Commanding Officer for Salalah and a reliable Interpreter in accordance with our Agreement. I have had previous reminders from him about this, which I have passed on to the Air Officer Commanding Aden and so far no action seems to have been taken, and I am again telegraphing him. He also asks whether any steps have been taken to despatch the arms and ammunition agreed to under the terms of the Air Agreement. 6. I am enclosing samples of the mica found by the Sultan. OFFICE COPY I,British Consulate, Muscat. 6th December 1947• (]\fy dear friend), I was very glad to receive your two letters by the mail on the 4th December and to hear that your Highness is in good health and that all is well in Dhofar. It is of course disappointing to us to hear that your Highness' return to Muscat has been delayed, but I fully appreciate the necessity of ensuring that the arrangements for the geologists' party are clearly understood and as far as possible, mutually satisfactory. * I do hope that the results of their exploration will prove that there is an abundance of oil and other mineral wealth waiting to be developed. I am sure that they will be most interested to see the Mica Mine which your Highness has discovered. The specimens you sent me seem very good in spite of the slight discolouration and since the mine is easily accessible by road from Murbat inshallah it may be easy to develop. Your Highness will by this time have seen Mr. Hartley and obtained his opinion on possibilities of sugar cane and other agricultural developments in the province. I have also telegraphed your Highness about one Colonel Dowson a possible candidate for the post of Foreign Minister, but not have yet received your Highness' reply which will doubtless arrive soon. I have some personal experience of Colonel Dowson who was Political Adviser to the British Forces in South Iraq at the time when I was Consul in Khorramshar. Our work overlapped to some extent and I was therefore able to form some opinion of his abilities. There is no doubt as to his energy and knowledge of the Arabs and Arabia. Politically, also I always thought that his advice and reports were the soundest of any I saw from officers serving in that area. In addition he is acknowledged to be one of the leading / experts OFFICE COPY2 / i experts on date culture. On the whole therefore, though he is perhaps rather old I think he may be as good a candidate as it is possible to find. I shall therefore await your Highness’ opinion with interest, certainly I think it is very desirable to fill this appointment as soon as possible. Regarding the visit of Doctor Bertram to advise on the fisheries, I have received your Highness final approval to the terms proposed for him and hope that he will be able to arrive next month. Regarding an interpreter for him, it occurs to me that it may be a satisfactory arrangement to attach to Doctor ' r 5 *- Bertram for his visit, either Saiyid Tarik or Saiyid Thuwaini who wile providing an agreeable companion and interpreter would also be able to obtain valuable first hand experience through y/atching his work. I am afraid I may find it difficult to find servants for Doctor Bertram, but perhaps your Highness would agree that I could ask Mr. Jamali to help me with this. I have written to CS=t«GEl-H$y to tell him that your Highness’ account with Lloyds Bank Limited London shows no credit from His f-fejesty’s Government for rent etc and have asked him to enquire into the matter. About the appointment of a Senior Commanding Officer and interpreter at Salalah, I have already ^ oven&amp;nded the Royal Air Force about this and am now re’mindiis^ ■yiemz%g§in and stressis^ the importance q0 the matter. /-w' All in Muscat goes well and this year we have been fortunate enough to have early and heavy rains - four times in the Batinah and interior and three times in Muscat-itself. It is very pleasant indeed for me to have hqt wife with me in Muscat and I am only sorry that owing to the difficiilty of schooling she was not able to bring also my children, who, I am sure would have enjoyed the fine beaches and sea bathing here. My wife plans to leave again about the middle of March before the hot weather, but I trust that your Highness will have returned and that she will have had the opportunity to meet you before then.&lt;0^ I agree changes in India have left many matters which require urgent discussion and I have in fact been wondering if some of the matters are not so important that I should not pay your Highness a visit in Dhofar to commence to have an early preliminary talk with your Highness. I will however telegraph your Highness if anything of real urgency develops. I am expecting a visit from Sir Rupert Hay on the 10th December and perhaps after I have had talks with him I shall be able to clear up one or two matters about which I am at present in doubt. Trusting your Highness and your Highness’ son Kabus are in the best of health with my very best wishes and kindest regards. Your Highness* sincere friend.

Id ) \ (Hr dear friend), I wrote a letter to your Highness at the beginning of the month and sent it via the Royal Air Force at Aden. Now I hear that Major Greenwood is leaving for Dhofar on Friday in the Nur el Pahr and will send this by his hand. I am sure your Highness will be very interested to see him and he on his part, I know, is most anxious to have a very early talk with your Highness about the Levies. So far as I have been able to judge he is a very smart and keen soldier and should do much to maintain or even improve the standard of military efficiency in the Levies. There are, however, certain administrative problems about which I think he is anxious for your Highness* views and advice. All in Muscat goes well and the difficulties we had been experiencing over the operation of the new Exchange Control Regulations in India and the closing of the Hundi transfers seem gradually to be settling themselves and for the time being at least, the Reserve Bank of India appear to be authorising payments to be made through the Consulate treasury. I do hope, however, that some day we shall be able to have a Bank in Muscat £*£ct I under \ stand that in Bahrain and Dubai where there is a Bank they have not had the same difficulty about effecting rupee transfers that we have experienced. I hope therefore that when the representative of the Eastern Bank who is due to arrive in the middle of January arrives, he will in the light of changed circumstances be able to make a different report to the Imperial Bank's representative who &lt; came here early in the year. / We His Highness Saiyid Said bin Taimur, Sultan of Muscat and Oman, A1 Kusn, Dhofar.' - 2 - We had a four day visit from Sir Rupert Hay, from the 10th to the 14th December. It was most interesting to see him again and I am sure he much enjoyed his visit, ^t seems that many of the problems arising out of the administrative changes consequent on the handing over of control in India have not yet been settled. I was not therefore able to get so much advice from him as I had hoped during his visit. He hopes, however, to be able to pay another visit early in March about the time your Highness returns, and I hope by that time things will have become more clear. He was most interested to hear of your Highness* discovery of a Mica, Mine at Murbat and, like me, anxious to hear the report of the Geologist party, which inshallah, will be favourable. Muscat is wonderfully cool and pleasant just now, and out at Bait al Falej the other day I noticed there were patches which showed up quite green after the recent rains. I wonder if your Highness remembers Colonel Galloway who was here as Consul in 1944 and later officiated as Resident, if so I am sure you will be interested to hear that he has just had a son born whilst he was on leave in England. I trust your Highness remains in good health and all is well in Dhofar. With the very best of good wishes.

(ify dear friend) I was very glad to receive your letter dated the 19th January which came with the “Nasr al Bahar', and to hear that all is well in Dhofar and that your Highness is in good health. It was most kind of you to send me so many pappaiya and bananas which were delicious and arrived quite fresh. It was/great treat also to receive the bottle of brown sugar from Dhofar, which is of a very high quality and very sv/eet. I am saving some to give to Colonel Hay when he next visits us here. Doctor Bertram arrived in Lius cat nearly three weeks ago and has been busy going up and down the coast examining the fish and methods of catching, and I am now sending this letter by his hand. Fortunately he has just finished his work at the time Y/hen K.M.S. Loch Glendhu has called to pick up ray interpreter before going down to Masirah to carry out her survey work, so Doctor Bertram is taking the opportunity to travel to Masirah in her, thereby saving a trip for the Ifesr al Bahar. 3* Next week I am expecting Mr. Findlay of the Eastern Bank to come and look into the Bank question. He' should have arrived long ago but was delayed on account of a cancellation in the B.I. mail service. We have had a great deal of difficulty over the mail service but I am glad to be able to say the B.I. have at last promised to ^et back to their pre-war schedule of one ship each way every other week - i.e.to say on the first Monday there will be an up boat and the second a down boat, and on the third an up boat again and so on. 4* I mentioned to your Highness in my letter of the 6th December that I had Yvritten to the i*ir Officer Commanding about the arrangements in Salalah. In reply he wrote to me on the 11th January / sayingsaying that he was arranging to relieve the present commander and v/as sending a Senior Staff Officer to visit Salalah as soon as possible. I hope that by now he has been to Salalah and has called on your Highness and discussed the various difficulties. 5» Your Highness will by now have received ray telegram stating that the first consignment of rifles and revolvers have arrived and that the rest have/shipped from England. It has not yet arrived in l.fruscat but I expect it will shortly. ^ • I have telegranhed to Sir Rupert Hay a skin ^ him to- * arrange to divert a tanker to Salalah sometime between the fourth and eighth iferch to bring your highness back to Muscat. I have not yet had any reply but have no doubt that arrangements will be made as requested. It will be very nice indeed to see your Highness back again in Muscat and I am sure we shall have a great deal to discuss. Sir Rupert Hay is also anxious to meet your Highness as soon as possible and is I understand trying to arrange a visit to Muscat early in March. I wonder if the geologists have yet arrived in Dhofar and if so, what progress they are making. I do hope the outcome of their work proves the presence of oil.
