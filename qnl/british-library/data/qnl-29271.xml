Dear HardInge, tie have had occasion recently to consider the question of the titles appertaining to the Hulers of the Arab States In the Persian Gulf which are In special treaty relations with His Majesty’s Government. As you know, there are three major States, Muscat, Bahrein and Kowelt. The Sultan of Muscat Is known as -His Highness-, while the Sheikhs of Bahrein and Kowelt are known as *Hls Excellency'. 2. The prefix 'His Excellency' la used In Arabia by officials and quite unimportant people, and It Is felt that It Is hardly appropriate to Eulers whose orestige In the Arab world It Is in the Interest of His Majesty’s Government to maintain and strengthen. It has accordingly been suggested that the Sheikh of Bahrein and the Sheikh of Koweit should In future be addressed, like the Sultan of Muscat, as 'Your Highness' and that this title should be dynastic. This proposal is supported by the Government of India and theSecretary of State concurs In It. It is also accepted by the other Interested departments in Whitehall, namely, the Foreign Office and the Admiralty. 3 * It is suggested that the Political Kesident in the Persian Gulf, who believes that the change of title would be welcome to the two hulers concerned, should first take some preliminary soundings to confirm that this is so. But it is, of course, necessary that the king's pleasure should be taken in regard to the proposed change of title before the Hesident takes any soundings. Lord Zetland would therefore be grateful for information whether, in the event of the Political Resident reporting that he understands the change would in fact be welcomed by the Sheikhs, His Majesty would be pleased toapprove a formal reconmendetion. If so, the Hesident would take the suggested soundings and if these showed that the change would be welcomed by the Sheikhs, Lord Zetland would then make a submission that a formal coimunlcation (perhaps at or about the time of the Coronation) should!

The draft explains itself. There appears to be no record of how the Sheikhs became 'Excellencies'. But in view of the fact that Persian Gulf Gun Salutes are submitted for sanction to the King, it seems appropriate that His Majesty's pleasure should be taken. At this stage this can only -be done informally, since it appears from the papers at the top of the file that the Government of India and the Resident agree that it would be desirable for the latter to sound the Sheikhs confidentially beforehand in order to make sure that the honour would be acceptable The various points of detail raised in the Foreign Office letter of the 7th May (P.Z. 3172/36) at Flag A have been cleared up by the Government of India's express letter of the 1st July (P.3. 5033/36) at Flag B, and both the Government of India and the Resident have concurred in the Admiralty proposals^regarding the procedure for the exchange of calls when the change of title has been effected. cau.

Sir, I am directed by J^r. Secretary Eden to request you to inform the Secretary of State for India that he has had under consideration your letter No. P.Z. 1693/36 of the 17th April, regarding the proposal that the Sheikhs of Bahrain and Koweit should in future be addressed as ,, Highness ,, instead of 'Excellency', and to state that, in deference to the views expressed by the Government of India, and subject to the following observations, Mr. Eden does not wish to raise further objection to this proposal. 2. Mr. Eden observes, hov/ever, that in paragraph 4 of your letter No. P.Z. 1693/36 of the 17th April, it is implied that these Arab rulers are not under the suzerainty of the Crown. Furthermore in the correspondence forming the enclosures in your letter under reply, reference is made by the Government of India, and by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, to the 'juridical independence', and by the Political Agent at Koweit to the 'independence', of these rulers. Mr. Edenfound convenient to refer to them as ”independent 'Miilsm: in special treaty relations with His Majesty 1 s ’’Government’', he is advised that, in international law, the effect of these treaty relations is that these rulers are in fact not independent sovereigns hut merely the rulers of British protected states enjoying a large measure of internal autonomy, and are only ’’independent sovereigns” in the sense that the Indian Princes or the rulers of the Malay States are so treated in English Municipal law by the English Courts. 3. The Secretary of State would be interested to learn how the Government of India propose that the new title should be conferred: that is to say, whether directl} by The King, or by a communication addressed to the Sheikhs, by His Majesty's authority, to the effect that His Majesty had approved of the use of the title of ”His Highness” by all British authorities in addressing or referring to the Sheikhs. 4. A further minor point on which Mr. Eden would be glad to have His Lordship's views is whether the French translation of the title ”His Highness” which it is proposed to confer on these Sheikhs should be ' Son Altesse ”, in accordance with European usage, or ” Sa Hautesse , a style which used, he is informed, to be employed in the case of the Khedives of Egypt.

As I mentioned in our conversation on the 8th March, it may interest you to hear that, though 1 have not seen any indication of such an aspiration on the part of Shaikh Sir Hamad bin * Isa Al Khalifah himself, in some of the speeches made to him during the annual Baladiyah (Municipality) reception in honour of his accession, the honorific used has improved in the last few years from ^Hakin al Bahrain* to 'Jalalah al Malik* (that is to say, from plain ’Ruler of Bahrain* to *His Majesty the King’)* These speeches need not be taken tooseriously, but they afford an indication that the Government of India’s apprehension is well founded. 3. I should perhaps add that when Shaikh Muhammad bin ’Isa Al Khalifah went to Kgypt and Palestine last year, he asked (through an indirect channel) that in his letter of recommendation he might be described as ’Prince’ on the ground (with which I have some sympathy) that in those countries the title ’Shaikh* does not carry the same weight as in this part of Arabia.

P.Z.1693/36 Department. 5000 7/35 please see paragraph 7 of Sir Andrew Ryan’s Despatch No,352 of the 10th December. Sir Andrew suggested that it would facilitate his intercourse on matters affecting Bahrein and Koweit with the Saudi Government if he could refer to them as ’His Highness' and not 'His Excellency'. The Foreign Office were at first disposed to throw cold water on this suggestion and the deleted portion of paragraph of the Secretary of State's telegram to India dated 11th January at P.Z.266/36* summarise^ their reaction. They were afraid that the grant of improved title might tend to emphasise the independence of the Sheikhs and be at variance with the policy of tightening control over them. secondly they felt the difficulty of competition from other sheikhdoms 4 e.g. Q,atar or the Trucial . if' aKU. Sheikhdoms^ for this honour if^given to Bahrein and Koweit. 2. The letter from the G*of I. dated 20th February which is now submitted with its enclosures covers these points and shows that both the G.of 1. and the Local political Authorities are in favour of the proposal. While not necessarily agreeing with all the G.of I.'s roq^oenTo- (e.g. it seems hardly appropriate to make a comparison with the Indian States), it certainly seems that there is a reasonable case for supporting the proposal of the G.of l. 3. While one cannot obviously make too much use of the argument^it should be borne in mind that we have, in fact, not been able to do very much as yet in the way of implementing our various obligations to the Sheikh of Koweit (in regard to his Date Gardens Blockade /Blockade etc*)&gt; and - some little sop of this kind may help to ease the position. As regards Bahrein, the Sheikh has been very complacent in all his dealings with H.M.G. and deserves any small token of esteem that can be given to him. 4 . in regard to the details about the title being dynastic and not related to gun salutes, the question of who should call first on whom, etc., we may presumably accept the views of the Resident and the G.of I. A I agree that this seems on the whole a good suggestion because - (i) the Sheikhs are juridically independent, and it anomalous to call them Excellencies and tends to lower them in the eyes of Ibn Saud, and thus perhaps to weakei our nosit ion in uoholding their interests against him (para. 7 of Sir A. Ryan’s despatch); (ii) though we (the F.O. more particularly) do not wish to emphasise their independence, there is little reason to fear that the title hi^mess will be regarded as importing a greater degree of independence; the Indii analogy, thou^i generally inapplicable, may be useful a showing that such is not the case; in any event, the n of giving the Sheikhs too high an opinion of themselves in their dealings with h.M.G. seems to carry little wei, as against the advantages of the proposal; \ ^ the proposal would not raise the question Ox recognising/ (in)Minute Paper.

Q H' It Dated New Delhi, the . 2 . 0 ' February 1936. Sir, With reference to paragraph 7 of Sir Andrew T jj, Ryan's d espatch No.352. dated the 10th December 1935, I am directed to forward a copy of a letter from the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, No. 939-S, dated the 5th December 1935, with enclo sures, and to say that for reasons given below the Government of India are in favour of addressing the Shaikhs of Bahrain and Kuwait in future as 'His Highness', and not as 'His Excellency'. 2. In support of this recommendation I am to refer to the circular letter to Local Governments on the subject of the use of the title of His High ness by Ruling Princes and others in India transmit ted to you under cover of the Political Secretary's letter No.76-M, dated the 24th September 1925. It was then decided with the approval of His Majesty's Government that the use of the style of 'His Highness' would in future be restricted to Indian Ruling Princes and Chiefs enjoying salutes (dynastic, personal or local) of 11 guns and over. The Shaikhs of Bahrain and Kuwait are both entitled to dynastic salutes of 7 guns and to a personal salute of 11 guns, and it follows that there is nothing under the orders of 1925 to debar the use of this style in I addre ssing2 . addressing the present Rulers of both these Arab Principalities. 3. It is implicit in Sir Andrew Ryan’s suggestion, as made, that the proposed new style of address will emphasise the independent sovereignty of the two Rulers. But the Govern ment of India, while on general grounds they support this recommendation, as endorsed by the Political Resident, must make it clear that in so doing they are actuated rather by the con sideration that the new style of address, so far from emphasising the independence of these Shaikhs, will in fact tend to bring them more into line with Ruling Chiefs in India who are under the suzerainty of the Crown. They have also in mind that the Shaikhs of Bahrain and Kuwait, being juridically independent sovereigns in special treaty relations with His Majesty's Government and the Government of India, might, should they so desire, take to themselves the title of His Majesty on the lines adopted by King Ibn Saud. Such a claim can perhaps be most easily forestalled by adoption of the present proposal. But it should be understood that this proposal, while it will no doubt enhance the position of the Shaikhs both in the eyes of their subjects and of all other Rulers in Arabia, is in reality not one to confer on them a new title, but merely to address them as 'His Highness' instead of 'His Excellency' as a style more appropriate to their positions. 4. It may be objected that the use of the title 'His Highness' will encourage a demand on the part of the Trucial Coast Rulers and in particular from the Shaikh of Qatar for a similar • * •similar dignity. To this the Government of India would reply that none of the Trucial Shaikhs are entitled to a gun salute which under the orders of 1925 would carry with it the title of 'His Highness'» while in local estimation no one of them, even including the Shaikh of Qatar, can be said to approach in dignity to the Sheikhs of Bahrein and Kuwait. The Government of India would further observe that the Sultan of Muscat, a 21 gun Ruler, is already addressed as 'His Highness', and there is much to be said for enhancing the dignities of the two leading Gulf Sheikhs to make them more equal to those enjoyed by that Ruler. 5. As regards paragraph 4 of the Political Resident's letter I am to say that the Government of India agree that the title, once used, should be continued on a dynastic basis irrespective of the question whether the successors of the present Shaikhs are granted a personal salute of 11 guns. The Government of India further agree with Colonel Powle's conclusion in para graph 5 of his letter that the dynastic salute of the Shaikhs now ruling need not be raised at present above 7 guns as a corollary of the present proposal. They are also in agreement with Colonel Powle's recommendation that all officers visiting Bahrain and Kuwait with the exception of the Commander-in-Chief and the Political Resident should, after the new style of address comes into use, make the first call on the Shaikh.6. In conclusion I am to add that since the Persian Gulf Rulers are not in competition with Ruling Chiefs in India, the Government of India do not anticipate that the adoption of the present proposal will lead to any complications in the matter of precedence in India- I have the honour to be Sir, Your most obedient servant Foreign Secretary to the Government of India.

Sir, I have the honour to enclose copies of the owirrespondence noted in the margin* 2 . I entirely concur in Sir Andrew Ryan’s view as expressed in his note. The raising of the official status of the Rulers in question would not only enable His Majesty’s Minister, Jedda, to refer to them in correspondence with the Saudi Government in more fitting terns than at present, but would be peculiarly appropriate at the present juncture for the reasons given by Sir Andrew Ryan- in connection with the G.C*B* which is being conferred on Kin,: Ibn Gaud* Moreover it is to our general interest to raise the prestige of these Rulers as much as possible, and tjieir present title of 'His ’Excellency” is hardly appropriate to independent Sovereigns which, juridically, is the position occupied by them* 3* Colonel Loch in his letter raises certain points which need some consideration, and the same points apply also to Kuwait. I agree with Colonel Loch (paragraph 2 of his letter) that if the title of “His Highness” is 1. Letter Bb.

At Ifuscat the first call on the Sultan (whose title is 'His Highness') is made hy all Officers &lt;ncliidlng the Commander-In-Chief and the Political Resident, hut the Sultan’s salute is 21 guns. 4 0 With regard to paragraph 4 of Colonel Loch’s letter. I agree that, for the reasons given, the title should he dynastic. In addition to these reasons it would obviously he embarrassing on the death of one of the Rulers concerned for His Majesty’s Minister, Jedda, to have to alter his title when mentioning the new Ruler in correspondence with the Saudi Government. 5. I appreciate the point raised hy Colonel Loch in his paragraph 5, hut I think it would he advisable to keep the dynastic salute at 7 guns to enable the guns for the new Ruler to he raised to 11 if his conduct proved satis factory. - ' The anomaly which Colonel Loch refers to, of the Political Agent, with a salute of 11 guns, iayi' e first call on the new Ruler with a lesser salute of 7 guns, could, I think, he disregarded. g # Presumably from the point of view of the Government of India there is no objection to the present Rulers being accorded the style of 'His Highness' since -vide Government of India letter Ho. 121-H, dated the 22nd September 1925- those in India with 11 guns are entitled to this style of address, and the slight exception to this rule hy which a na* Ruler would only recolvc** *•••4 receive 7 guns but still be styled H His Highness” could doubtless be overlooked in the special circumstances ruling in the Persian Gulf.

I hardly think that the title of **His Highness** with its consequent enhancement of status could in the circumstances of the Persian Culf be made personal* as from the local point of view a reversal of calling procedure on the advent of a new Ruler might be very embarrassing* while from the wider point of view it would tend to defeat our object of emphasising the independent sovereignty of the Ruler. 5. It would also be necessary to consider whether^the step might not make it difficult to insist on the personal eleven gun salute reverting to the dynastic seven gun salute, for if the new Ruler were to have only a seven gun salute, it would be anomalous for the Political Agent (for example) to pay the first call • 6. I have not had time to consider the matter fully* but mention the above points as they come into mindi 7. I have ventured to keep a copy of the note in my confidential records.

The Honourable the Political Resident* It may be worth while to put in writing the suggestion I mentioned this morning about the status of the Shaikhs of Kuwait and Bahrain* although it is entirely personal to myCself and I have not had occasion to speak on th« subject to the Foreign Office* Other views may possibly be held there but I think they would in the main be guided by the opinion of the India Office and Government of India* We have had increasing reasons to emph sise vis^a-vls Ibn Saud the importance which we attach to the Eastern Arabian Shaikhs and especially the Shaikhs of Kuwait and Bahrain as independent rulers bound to us by special ties. It has for some time seemed to me unfortunate that in correspondence with the Saudi Government lyshould have to refer to these two Shaikhs as ’His Excellency , merely using a title which normally applies to subordinate persons and in Eastern usage to persons of quite small account* My suggestion is that His Majesty t s Government should in some appropriate way confer on them the official status of ’•His Highness” » the Arabic equivalent of which would be H S$' 3 u i*e« the title borne by the Amir of Trans Jordan and* I understand the Sultan of Muscat* I approach the subject from one point of view only and there may be objections unknown to me, from other points of view* I may, however, put forward two considerations, which might make thw suggestion acceptable at the present t ime t- (a) The King is conferring the G.C.B. on Ibn Saud and I am taking the Insignia to Riyadh* I think it would be inappropriate to confer honours of the same king on the two Shaikhs at the present juncture but an improvement of their status in the way suggested above would mark the fact tha t attentions to Ibn Saud (which I myself have advocated) do no t **••»••do not mean that we undervalue other rulers with whom we have special relations and who have deserved well of His Majesty f s Government* (b) The end of Jubilee Year would be a by no means inappropriate time to dignify the two Shaikhs in the manner suggested* Sd.
