A member of the prominent Al-Rasoul family, he tells of having lived on the hillside for 45 years. He explains how Qurna’s inhabitants had mainly relied on tourism for their income, by making and selling alabaster, granite and other types of stone souvenirs, and by hosting European tourists who enjoyed the view from the family home (a well-known residence called the White House) of the Ramesseum temple and other sights. Hussein recalls terrorist attacks of the past and how he and family members attempted to help survivors, mentioning terrorism’s impact on tourism. He credits tourists for exposing the Quranawis to the wider world, and changing some customs.  Hussein describes the past social life of Qurna, the education of children, and celebrations and traditions and how these changed over the years.  Beliefs recalled include the visits by women to the pond inside Medinet Habu temple to receive blessings against infertility.  He also mentions the historical pharaonic archaeological remains at Qurna and the selling of antiquities in the past, before this was made illegal in the 1980s, and some activity that persisted afterward. He expresses his anger at accusations of antiquities theft against his grandfather and the rest of the Al-Rasoul family, who he said protected historic sites, calling for tour guides to stop accusing his family. According to Hussein, relocation from the Qurna hillside had many advantages in terms of improving the quality of life of its inhabitants, stating that his generation endured many hardships that the younger generation will not face since being relocated. </dc:description><dc:language>Arabic</dc:language><dc:coverage>Al Qurnah, Egypt</dc:coverage><dc:format>oral histories (document genres)</dc:format><dc:source>Qurna Hillside Oral History Project; Rare Books and Special Collections Library; The American University in Cairo</dc:source><dc:rights>Copyright 2017, American University in Cairo.
