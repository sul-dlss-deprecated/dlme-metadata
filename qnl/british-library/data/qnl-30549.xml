The word Oman, in its widest geographical meaning, is used to designate that part of the Arabian continent v/hich is enclosed between the Persian Gulf, the Indian Ocean, and the Ruba-ul-Khali, or U re at Desert of Southern Arabia. Oman consists of 3 belts. First the low littoral extending for about 900 miles from Tibbat, on the V/estern side of the Musandam peninsula, to Ras Dharbat Ali in Dhofar. From this must be excluded a small strip on the East coast of Ras Musan dam from Dibah to Khor Kalba, which is in the administration of the minor chiefs of the Trucial Coast. The coastal strip varies in width from a few hundred yards to several miles. The second, and chief, physical feature is a mountainous tract which, commencing at Ras Musandam, runs parallel to the coast and terminates in the vicinity of Ras-al-Hadd. From Ras Musandam to Dibbah this tract is called Ruus-ul-Jibal; the remainder is known as the Hajar of Oman and is divided by the Wadi Semail, beyond Jebel Akhdar, into Eastern and Western Hajar. Hajar attains its maximum altitude (nearly 10,000 ft) in Jebel Akhdar a group of lofty mountains south-west of Muscat, enclos ing many valleys of great fertility. The third and inner belt is a long and uneven South West ward declivity of the high lands which merges into the desert of the interior. The country is not regularly divided into administrative areas, but falls naturally into several distinct geographical tracts. Ruus-ul-Jibal and the two parts of Hajar form three territorial divisions, and between Western Hajar and the sea is enclosed the long and narrow, but fertile and populous, mari time district known as Batinah, Immediately East of the rich Wadi Semail the mountains of Hajar approach the coast in con fused masses, and beyond this again the range actually skirts the sea almost as far as Ras-ul-Hadd. The valleys of Eastern Hajar are not so numerous, nor, with the notable exception of Wadi Tayin and Wadi Semail and their tributaries, generally so populous as those of Western Hajar. Separated from the Batinah by Western Hajar lie the two inland districts of Dhahirah and Oman Proper. Of these Dhahirah slopes Westwards to the Ruba- ul-Khali, while Oman Proper, a tableland rising 1,500 to 2,000 feet above the sea and practically surrounded by hills, dis charges its drainage towards the Indian Ocean. Inland of Eastern Hajar are the districts of Sharqiyah and Ja f alan. Sharqiyah adjoins Oman Proper, while Ja’alan touches the South-East corner of Sharqiyah at one end and the Indian Ocean at the other. The barren and desolate coast from Ras-al-Hadd to Ras Nus has no general name. Off it lie Masirah and the Kuria Muria islands. Beyond Ras Nus is the district of Dhofar consisting of a highly fertile maritime plain and surrounded by the crescent of the Samahan hills. Springs and streams abound in the hilly districts of Oman and in Ja’alan but elsewhere the supply of water depends en tirely on wells and varies in amount and quality. Districts. (a) Ruus-ul-Jibal. A mountainous district forming the Northern part of the Oman Promontory. Its coast line runs from Ras Sha’am in the Persian Gulf round Ras Musandam to Dibah- Betah in the Gulf of Oman. The Trucial frontier between Ras Sha’am, 1.2. SECRET Ras Sha’am and Dibah-Bei’ah form the Southern boundary. The whole area is a maze of barren mountains which, on the Eastern side, rise abruptly from the sea and form precipitous cliffs, some of considerable extent. Two of them viz., Ghubbah Ghazirah (or Malcolm Inlet) and Khor ash Sham (or Elphinstone Inlet) form fine natural harbours capable of sheltering a number of ships, but, owing to extreme heat, are impracticable as harbours during the hot weather for ships with European crews. The district is sparsely populated by the Shihuh tribe. (b) Batinah. This is the most important coastal district of the Sultanate extending for 150 miles along the coast from Khor Kalba to Hail-ul-Umair. Inland it extends to the foothills of Western Hajar, which run roughly parallel with the coast at a distance of 10 to 20 miles. The Batinah is famous for its date belt, which fringes the seashore and in some places extends for 7 miles inland. Water is everywhere obtainable from wells the average depth of which is 15 to 20 feet. The district is popu lous and many tribes are represented. The chief of these are ^ the Yal Sa : d and the Hawasinah. (c) Muscat. The tract of country which surrounds the town of Muscat may be conveniently treated as a separate district though it has no special name. Its limits may be regarded as the Wadi Samali on the West, and the Wadi Taiyin on the South, and the sea on the North and East. It thus has a length of 50 miles from West-North-West to East-South-East and a maximum breadth of about 25 miles. Most of its surface is barren and rugged but in places the country opens out into more or less level tracts. The largest plain is Saih Hattat. It is about 30 miles in length and includes the upper basins of the Wadis Adai and Umm Jalas (Mijlas). Its greatest width is about 8 miles, Ruwi village of about 50 stone houses and some huts is strategi cally important. It is approximately 4-|- miles inland, North- West of Muscat, and at the end of the good notor road, capable of taking 30 cwt. lorries, which runs from Muscat through Matrah and passes the landing ground and barracks at Beit-el- ... x Felej. At Ruwi all routes to the interior diverge. There is extensive cultivation and vegetables for the markets of Matrah and Muscat come from here. (d) Western 'Hajar. The mountainous district of Western Hajar extends from Wadi-ul-Khor on the North-West to Wadi Semail on the South-East, having a length of about 160 miles. The watershed of the range is roughly parallel to the coast and runs at an average distance of 40 miles inland. Its bound ary on the seaward side is the line of its foothills rising ix’o..- the plain of the Batinah. The boundary with the district of Dhahirah is indefinite. The mountain system rises to its highest in the mass of Jebel Akhdar at its South-East end which has an elevation of nearly 10,000 ft. There are no large towns in Western Hajar and the small towns and villages are, with one or two minor exceptions, on the seaward side of the range. The most important valley in this district is the Wadi Para. (e) Dhahirah* The district of Dhahirah lies between Western Hajar on the North-East and the Ruba-ul-Khali, or the Great Desert, on the South-West. At its North-West extremity lies ,he independent district of Jau and it is separated from Oman proper by the.....SECRET proper by the by the range of Jebel Khor, It is about 100 miles in length from North-West to South- East v/ith a breadth of about 50 miles* Dhahirah consists of an uneven plain sloping from the foot hills of Western Hajar to the Great Desert in which the whole of its drainage is lost* There are two principal valleys, the Wadi Dhank and the Wadi-il-Kebir* (f) Eastern Hajar* Is a tract of mountainous country extending £or about 120 miles from Wadi Semail and its tributaries on the North-West, to the Jebel Khamis range on the South-East, Its watershed, which is continuous with that of Western Hajar, is about 50 miles from the sea at the head of the Wadi Semail, but Eastwards its distance from the coast diminishes until, in the neighbourhood of Sur, the watershed approaches within 20 miles ^ of the sea* There is no continuous coastal plain such as that which separates Western Hajar from the coast, and for some dis tance near Daghman the foothills of Eastern Hajar stretch down ^ to the sea* The hills maintain a comparatively high elevation over the greater part of the district, reaching 5,250 ft. at the head of &gt;yadi layin, and 6,300 ft. inland of Kuryat; but beyond Sur they fall away to 2,000 ft. and die out altogether at Ras-ul-Hadd. (g) Oman Proper,, This district consists of a central plateau shut in on the North by Jebel Akhdar and on the South by the desert. On the West Jebel Khor separates it from Dhahirah and on the East there is no defined boundary dividing it from the district of Sharqiyah. The 2 main channels of drainage are the Wadi Kalbu anu the Wadi Halfain, both of which traverse it from North to South. ,V The central portion of Oman Proper called Jauf, the 'hollow” or ’'basin”, is a stony plain dotted with small volcanic hills and mounds and contains the oasis of Bahlah, Nizwa and Izki. The North part under Jebel Akhdar is very barren and seamed with dry watercourses. At many places of Oman Proper the springs are hot, their temperature varying from 102° to 122° P. (h) Sharqiyah* This is an inland district bounded on the North by the foothills of Eastern Hajar and merging on the South into the Great Desert; at its South-West corner it meets the distrJ^u of Ja j alan 0 Sharqiyah consists of 4 tracts running from North-V/est to South-East. These are Buldan-ul-Habus, Buldan-ul-Masakirah, Buldan-ul-Hirth and Badiyah. The last named tract is an open sandy plain the others consisting of a network of small valleys adjoining the Hajar hills. The main line of drainage in its upper course is known as the Wadi Ibra and in its lower course as the Wadi Ha'imah, (i) The South-East Coast. The strip of country from the South border of Ja’alan to Ras Nus, which marks the Eastern limit of Dhofar, has no general name, but falls within the area of the Oman Sultanate. It is an extremely barren stretch of coast nearly 45C miles in length backed by the Great Desert and it possesses no place of importance with the exception of the islands of Masirah and Mahot. 3. (j) Dhofar**SECRET MUSCAT TOWN AND MATRAH Muscat Town . The capital of the Oman Sultanate and the residence of the Sultan. Inland the town is cut off from the interior by rugged and precipitous hills of igneous rock which extend for 10 miles along the coast to a depth inland of 3 miles. £he town of Muscat is built in the basin formed by these hills at the head of the Bay of Muscat. Muscat consists of a walled town and an extensive collec tion of unwalled suburbs* The town fronting the narbour is about ^ mile in length from East to West and extends i mile inland. The wall is built on the South and West sides and has towers at intervals. On the East side the hills are precipitous and no wall is necessary. The main gate, is on the West side, the Bab-ul-Kebir, through which runs the motor road through the majority of the suburbs and to Matrah. The Bab-us-Saghir, on the road to the village of Sidab, is on the South side. On the seaward side are 2 forts built on cliffs, about 150 ft. high, on either side of the beach in front of the town. They are of Portuguese construction and that on the East side called Jalali is used as a jail. The one on the West side is called Mirani. They are now of no military value. Small blockhouses command the approaches of the town from the land side. The water supply of the town comes from wells situated about J mile up the Wadi-ul-Kebir which receives the drainage of the surrounding hills. The water, though plentiful, is slightly brackish. The water is stored in tanks joined b an aqueduct leading to the landing place South of Mirani fort. Many of the houses ) of the town are well-built structures of 2 or more storeys. r -^he suburbs consist mostly of mud huts, but some of them contain a few fairly good houses. Post and Telegraph Offices have been established by the Indian Govt, '^he town is connected by cable with Bushire and thus with all parts of the world. The British Agency and Consulate and the Sultan's palace are situated on the sea front. South of the Consulate is the Agency Hospital, and behind the Consulate in the town is the R.A.P. rest house and wireless station. A small electric light plant has recently been installed in the town. The R.A.F* landing ground is at Beit-el-Felej, 4 to 5 miles inland and is connocted to Muscat by the only main route from the hinterland. A motor road running from there to Matrah, and then winding along the edge of the sea and over a pass into Muscat town. The barracks are connected by telephone with the Agency. There is a bomb store at the landing ground. Here also is the only flat area available for a camping ground. The country in the immediate vicinity, in general is quite unsuitable for the use of armoured cars or mechanical transport. M.T. can be employed on the winding road from Muscat to Matrah and on to the landing ground area. The bay is f mile deep and J mile wide, giving good anchor age for steamers. It is open to the North-North-West and conse quently to the Shamal wind. Matrah. A large town about 2 miles to the West of Muscat, It is larger than the capital and is more important commercially, as it has direct communication with the interior. Like the capital, Matrah is enclosed by rugged hills on the landward side but its isolation is less complete. The town is.... * oSECRET See Persian Gulf Pilot, 8th Edition 1932, Pages 43-47, The town is built at the head of Matrah Bay and extends along the beach for about J mile and has an average depth in land of i mile. It is protected on the landward side by a wall with fortified gateways, the principal gate being the Bab-ul- Kebir at the South-West comer of the town. By this gate, the road leaves to the village of Ruwi whence routes branch to the Batinah coast and to various parts of the interior. On the seaward side, at the East end of the town, is a fort built on a rocky eminence. It is a Portuguese construction of the same type and value as the forts of Muscat. As around Muscat, blockhouses command the approaches of the town from the land ward side. The houses of Matrah are meaner than those of Muscat. The suburbs are also more squalid. Water of indifferent quality is obtained from wells around the town. The Bay of Matrah is less remakable in appearance than the Bay of Muscat and is more easily entered. Though open to the North-East it is sheltered from the North-West and is preferred as a harbour by native craft. It has anchorage for steamers. The town is governed by a Wali on behalf of the b u itan.5, b SECRET © 2 0 CLIMATE* The climate of Oman is not unhealthy though the heat in summer is intense and the average rainfall scanty. At Muscat and along the sea coast generally the climate owing to its humidity is relaxing and oppressive except in the coldest months. In winter from October to March cold and wet weather may be encountered and malarial fever makes this season unhealthy Muscat has the reputation of being one of the hottest oowns in the world, and the themometric observations present no cri terion for the actual intensity of the heat 9 which is here con centrated by the hills, The barren hills further sustain the heat throughout the day until midnight. The Batinah and the district round Sur is much cooler in summer, especially at. night, than the rocky tract in which Muscat lies. In the inter ior the summer heat is dry and oppressive and hot land winds prevail. ^ The ordinary annual i*ainfall in Oman varies between 3 ana 6 ins.' but occasionally violent stonrs sweep over the country, * The prevailing winds in the Oulf of Oman in the winter months during the north-east monsoon are Shamals and Nashis. The general direction of the Shamal is North-West but it changes w^ th the trend of the coast* Its usual duration ^.s 3 days but it may last 7. The Nashi is a north-easterly wind which blows very violently in the Oudf. During .winter south east winds called Qaus or ’’Sharki 1 ’ alternate with the Shamals but only have great force from Dec. to April. These winds often arise suddenly and are much dreaded by native craft; and, owing to the fact that most harbours in the Gulf are un sheltered, it is necessary for steamers to keep steam up while they are in port. The south-v/est monsoon is not felt inside Ras-al-Hadd and only light variable winds prevail between June and September. Muscat and Matrah have the most sheltered anchorages on the Arabian coast, but landing of men and material would be much interfered with during a strong wind from any direction and may in the case of a Shamal or Nashi be held up altogether* Weather is the ruling factor in landing operations at every place along the shores of Oman, as with the exception ox Muscat and Matrah every anchorage is exposed to winds from any direction.A SECRE T a ) A ELIO hJ J v ' SsaJ-Jil?

The last epidemic of smallpox occurred in 1922, Sporadic cases are common along the Batinah coast during the summer months* Cholera is infrequent no cases having occurred for some years. Quarantine regulations are carried out at the port ol Muscat in accordance with the Paris Sanitary Convention of .0.926, The Political Agency Surgeon acts as quarantine medical officer. Insects, Mosquitoes are numerous during winter particularly in towns. The practice of storing water obtained from wells the in cisterns and in earthenware vessels in houses as well as pools in gardens afford ample breeding places for mosquitoes* Flies are a pest during the cooler months but die off when the temperature rises in the hot weather. Hospitals . The Agency Hospital is south of the Consulate in Muscat town. It is of 20 beds., 2 of which are reserved for Europeans. It has an out dispensary. The hospital is in char e of the Agency Surgeon, an officer of the Indian Medical Dept; assisted by n Indian Sub-Assistant Surgeon.

These are imported from India in quantities suiiicient only for the needs of the population^ ihe Batineh is the most fertile area and is celebrated for its^ dates, which should be procurable in vast quantities during ohe harvest season, and in lesser quantities throughout the year. Other crops grown are barley, sugar and lucerne. Fruits include mangoes, bananas, figs, limes and melons* All such supplies and vegetables would be available in small quantities at any given point. Vegetables are grown in quantities for local consumption at Ruwi, which supplies vegetables for the markets of Matrah and Muscat, and as it has a large water supply this cultivation could be extended. A limited quantity is available at Quryat &lt; Sur and at the ports on the Batineh up to Sohar, xhe following vegetables are obtainable at Matrah and Muscat, Brinjal, broad beans, pumpkin, cucumber, water melon and melon. There are no supplies of cattle. Goats are fairly plentiful the local supply being supplemented by imports from the Makran coast. In the Batineh, cattle, sheep and goats in limited numbers can be had at the larger villages. There is no grazing icr horses. Small quantities of lucerne are obtainable at Ruwi, Sur, Quryat, Sib and Sohar. Fish in considerable quantity is available at the coastal towns and villages. A force of any size landing in Oman would therefore be dependent for all supplies, except fuel, on an overseas base„ Sufficient supplies, however, should always be available in Muscat bazaar and in the larger towns to feed two companies of Indian infantry for about one month without further imports. Local supplies at most villages in the Batineh would be suffi- \ cient for one company for a short period.SECRET, © 8 5c, PETROL In 1937, Petroleum Concessions Ltd, secured two concessions Prom the Sultan of Muscat and Oman, The first was for the Dhofar district of Oman, a maritime plain some 30 miles long by 5 miles broad lying almost in the centre of the South coast of Arabia, the second was for the remainder of the Sultan's Arabian territory,, Both concessions were granted for 75 years. During the winter of 1938-1939 a reconnaissance of the Dhofar area took place, and an exploration party of the Company proceeded to Baraimi Oasis from Muscat, by the hinterland route returning by Sohar and the coast. No immediate results were achieved and at the present stage (1939) it is impossible to say what prospects exist of finding oil in the Sultanate. Apart from the supply of petrol and oil maintained by the R.A.F* the Anglo-Iranian Oil Co. maintain a small depot of petrol and paraffin at a cove in Riyam Bay, Average quantities of stocks held are 6,000 galls of petrol and 12,000 galls of kerosene.

SECRET• MASIRA, Masira Island is a small island about 40 m.x 5 nu in extant situated on the East coast of Oman in approximate position 20° 40 ¥ No , 58° 50 ; E. It is within the territory of the Sultan of Muscat and is ruled over by a local Sheikh. Before the war it was thought that the Channel between this island and the mainland could be used as a convoy assembly base in the event of Aden being untenable. H.M .S .''CHALLENGER' 5 accordingly carried out a survey. (Chart Fo056) At the beginning of the v/ar H.M.S.'LIVERPOOL' laid buoys tc mark the approach to the anchorage and H.M„S.'LUCIA' arrived from Bombay*to act as base Depot Ship. Further surveys were carried out by H.M t S.'LUCIA' and H.M.I.S.'LAWRENCE' ana an ^ alternative channel was marked by beacons. The anchorage is a bad one and difficult to approach and is, moreover, open to the full force of the South-West Monsoon, during which it would be quite untenable as a convoy assembly port. In October 1939 it was abandoned by H.M.Ships and the natives removed all the beacons and most of the buoys. There is an R,A e F. landing ground and petrol store near the southern shore of SUR-I-MASIRA lagoon, which is very shallow and approach by boat at low water entails much wading. The best way to reach this place is to land at RAS DHA and walk overland. i The natives are very primitive and care should he taken not to land except as a fully armed party of 6 or more. T ;J® natives are armed and would not have any hesitation about burcpiu c , off' a single European landing or even an unarmed party. The Chart (F.056) is reliable but marks are often difo-icul - to distinguish owing to mist, and ships should not expect to find any buoys or beacons as the natives' predatory instincts are well developsdo 26 26 oSECRK .

Tactical considerations have been taken into account in suggesting tie following:- a) RUWI. Brigade Headquarters, attached troops and one Infantry Battalion b) WATIYA. One Infantry Battalion. c) DAR SAIT. M ' ' d) SIDAB. Sufficient space and suitable camp sites are available for the above at ail these places. Water. a) RUWI . There are ten wells, of which one is unfit for drinking purposes. The remaining nine contain approxim ately 5 ', Ooo galloms, but this quantity is never likely to be exceeded and might quickly diminish if extensively used. It would a,so be undesirable to take all the water away from the cultivation here as Ruwi is the only source of supply for vegetables in Muscat and Matrah. b) WATIYA . A FalaJ brings water in sufficient quantity for one battalion. c ) DAR SAIT . There are numerous wells, of which four can be relied on to provide sufficient drinking water. d) SIDAB . Two wells here are fit for drinking purposes. One is liable to turn brackish after a certain amount of use, but the other can be re±ied on. A battalion has camped here in the past.Supplies. A brigade would have to rely almost entirely on it's supplies from outside. Fresh vegetables are grown in Ruwi and during the season a small quantity might be available, but not sufficient to take into account. G-rass and lucerne is a^so grown, but there is hardly likely to be enough for the retirements of a brigade. Fish In any quantity and a very little meat could be obtained. Firewood can be obtained in any quantity from Muscat provided 15 days notice is given. This is obtained from the Batinah coast and Is sent to Muscat by sea, mainly from Khadhra. Batinah Coast. A brigade moving along the coast to Sohar would best do so in parties of about the strength of a battalion. For such units camping places can be found all a ong the coast and would not be difficult to select. Collective brigade camps couu.d be established at sib, Khaburah and Sohar. At Khaburah the only site is one and a half miles beyond the village nen.r the road. At Sohar the Landing ground would have to be used.

I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, U/* Major, Political Agent &amp; H.B.M*s Consul, Muscat.COMMENTS. 1. GEOGRAPHICAL . This section has been taken from Volume II of the Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf by Lorimer published in 1908. It is therefore not absolutely accurate as knowledge of the area has increased consiserably and there have been political changes. For instance it is now clear that the Baraimi Oasis belongs in part to the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi and in part is within the jurisdiction of the Government of Muscat. 2 . The ,, Qaus ,, can blow as hard in July and August as at any time of the year. The South West Monsoon is not felt from a maritime point of view but it has a very definite effect.on the climate. The climate in July and August is normally cooler than June and Septem ber. The country is not subject to the H Gurbi ,t during this period and the fall in the sea temperature at the beginning of August helps to make that month much the least unpleasant of the hot weather months. The f, Gurbi ,f or westerly wind is hot and dry and it may blow at any time during March, April, May, June, September and October. It lasts for from one to seven days, and high temperatures are often recorded. It starts at any time of the day or night and is always hot and usually dusty. 3. MEDICAL. Line 12. For '1930' read '1941'. Line 13. For '16' read '27 M . Last line. Exclude all after 'Matrah' as the Zanana Hospital at Muscat has been closed since March, 1939. 4. MAINTENANCE . The vegetables grown at Ruwi and elsewhere are of Brinjal, Lady Fingers, Sweet Potato and Chilly type. 5. PETROL /HT' 5. PETROL . The average Anglo-Iranian Oil Company’s stocks held at Muscat are s- Petrol - 8,000 gallons -16,000 gallons Paraffin Fuel . The main source of wood for fuel is the interior of the country and the Batinah plain. The majority of the large logs are not obtained from the Batinah Coast 6 * WATER This section needs considerable revision for instance there is no aqueduct in use in Muscat town. The water supply is from wells at Tuyan and there are to private pipelines but the major portion of the water is carried to the consumers in skins on donkeys or by men. I suggest this section be carefully revised and up to date information obtained about those places only which are considered of military importance. 7. ELECTRICITY The Political Agency has its own electric supply and also supplies the office of Messrs. Cable &amp; Wireless Limited. The current is 230 volts D.C. and the engines are two Lister's ten horse power eaeh. The town has a separate supply produced by one Lister's thirty-eight horse power engine and one Peter's twelve horse power engine. The current is 230 volts D.C. The town of Matrah has an electric supply from one Lister's thirty-eight horse power engine. The current is 230 volts D.C. The Wireless Station and Rest House of the Royal Air Force have their own supply. 9 10 9. QUARRIES . There are stone quarries for second grade building stone at Muscat and Matrah and for first grade stone at Jissah. These quarries are only worked when there is a demand for stone. 10. LABOUR . Coolie labour is available. Skilled labour is scarce and local carpenters and n&amp;jons are on the whole indifferent work-men. There are no skilled plumbers or iron workers. 11. ACCOMMODATION . The population of Matrah is 8,500. The population of Muscat is 4,500. No accommodation for British or Indian troops is available in or outside the towns. No sawn timber is available. No cold storage plants. Nfltes for an Infantry Brigade and attached troops in the M uscat area by Major A.O.C. Pettyfer. I. A.. Military Adviser to the Sultan ;- (1) . Camp Sites . Owing to the insufficiency of water in any one place, a brigade would have to be split up within the area. Tactical considerations have been taken into account in suggesting the following (a) . Ruwi.

Sufficient space and suitable camp sites are available for the above at all these places. (2) . Water . (a) . Euwj . There are ten wells, of which one is unfit for drinking purposes. The remaining nine contain approximately 5,000 gallons, but this quantity is never likely to be exceeded and might quickly dininish if extensively used. It would also be undesirable to take all the water away from the cultivation here as Ruwi is the only source of supply for vegetables in Muscat and Matrah. (b) * Watiya . A Falaj brings water in sufficient quantity for one Battalion. (c) * Par Sait . There are numerous wells, of which four can be relied on to provide sufficient drinking water. (d) • Sidab . Two wells here are fit for diinking purposes. One is liable to turn brackish after a certain amount of use, but the other can be relied on. A battalion has camped here in the4 past. (3). Supplies . A brigade would have to rely almost entirely on it's supplies from outside. Fresh vegetables are grown in Ruwi and during the season a small quantity might be available, but not sufficient to take into account. Grass and lucerne is also grown, but there is hardly likely to oe enough for the requirements of a brigade. Fish in any quantity and a very little meat could be obtained. Firewood can be obtained in any quantity from Muscat provided 15 days notice is given. This is obtained from the Batinah Coast and is sent to Muscat by sea, mainly from Khadhra. (4). Batinah Coast . A brigade moving along the coast to Sohar would best do so in parties of about the strength of a Battalion. For such units camping places can be found all along the coast and would not be difficult to select. Collective brigade camps could be establish ed at Sib, Khaburah and Sohar. At Khaburah the only site is one and a hlaf miles beyond the village near the road. At Sohar the Landing Ground would have to be used. Neither of these places would be suitable if heavy rain was expected. 12. TOWN PLANS . Aerial photographs of the towns of Muscat and Matrah are available from Air Headquarters, ’Iraq. 14. ROADS. As, I have never seen the reference book quoted under this heading I am unable to make any comment. 15. ROAD TRANSPORT . There are about fifty-two motor cars available in Muscat and Matrah towns.17.

INCLUDING- KHOR KUWAI. I. GENERAL. The Sultanate of Muscat and Oman is a sovereign state, the independence of which Great Britain and Prance undertook to respect in 1862. Since 1916 the authority of the Sultan of Muscat and Oman has been limited to his capital and a narrow strip along the coast from Shinas in western Hajar to Salala in Dhofar on the southern coast of Arabia. He further controls an area at the northern extremity of the Trucial Coast and Gwadur on the sou coast of Baluchistan, near the Iranian frontier. The of the interior, in other words the greater proportion of the inhabitants, do not acknowledge his sway and live in practical independence of him under their own chiefs. If they acknow ledge anyone, it is the Imam of Oman. There are now, however, indications that the Sultan is endeavouring to extend his in fluence over these tribes of the hinterland. But how far he will be successful is still uncertain. Although the Sultan of Muscat is in theory a wholly inde pendent ruler, British influence has been predominant m Muscat since the end of the 18th Century; and in practice the relations which exist between the Sultan and H.M.Government and the Government of India approximate to those which obtain the Government of India and an Indian State under the suzerainty of His Majesty. H.M. Government and the Government of India have been represented in Muscat by the Political Agent since 1861, who since 1867 holds a commission as Consul for Muscat and also exercises the powers of a District Magistrate and Sessions ^^g e - Political control rests with the Government of India subject to the general control of H.M.Government. The actual extent of the responsibility of H.M. Government for the protection of the territory of Oman against external aggression has never been defined. However, they have recently reaffirmed their readiness to protect the Sultan s territories, including Gwadur, from any external aggression resulting from the present wai?. In addition, in the event of internal dis turbances, they are prepared to give him such assistance as may be possible. In September 1939 the Sultan expressed his readiness to render such assistance as was within his power to H.M.Government. Administration.

It is of 20 beds two of which are reserved for Europeans. It has an out dispensary. The Hospital is in charge of the Agency Surgeon, an officer of the Indian Medical Department; assisted by an Indian Sub-Assistant Surgeon. There is an American Mission Hospital maintained by Missionaries at Matruh, with a Zenana Hospital in Muscat, Epidemics. Up to March 1930 no epidemic of plague had occurred for the previous 16 years. The last epidemic of smallpox occurred in 1922. Sporadic cases are common along the Batinah coast during the summer months. Cholera is infrequent no cases having occurred for some years. Quarantine Regulations are carried out at tne port oi Muscat, in accordance with the Paris Sanitary Convention of^ 1926. The Political Agency Surgeon acts as quarantine medical officer. Insects. Mosquitoes are numerous during winter particularly in the towns. The practice of storing water obtained from wells in cisterns and in earthenware vessels in houses as well as pools in gardens afford ample breeding places for mosquitoes. Flies are a pest during the cooler months but die off when the temperature rises in the hot weather. OTHER PLACES IN OMAN. The Sou th East Coast. The strip of country from the south border of Ja’alan to Ras Nus which marks the Eastern limit of Dhofar, has no general name but falls within the area of the Oman Sultanate. It is an extremely barren stretch of coast nearly 450 miles in length backed by the Great Desert and it possesses no place of importance with the exception of the Islands of Masira and Mahot, Masira Island© y-s 8. SECRET. MUSCAT AND OMAN. INCLUDING KHOR KUWAI Masira Island. (a) General Masira Island is within the territory of the Sultan of Muscat and is ruled by a local Sheikh. _ _ The natives both from the mainland and from the Island, are reported to be of friendly disposition, but are very primi tive and care should therefore be taken not to land except as a fully armed party of six or more. A large fleet of fishing dhows frequents the locality, as many as twenty having been seen anchored at the same time. Each dhow contained 5-7 men, and suitable precautions to guard against a surprise attack should be taken as the natives are generally armed. (b) Port Facilities . Berths and Anchorages . The anchorage is a bad one, and dif- ficult to approach, while it is open to the full force of the South-West Monsoon. . ^ ^ __ Holding ground in the outer anchorage is bad, two anchors being necessary, and short notice for steamis recommended. In the inner anchorage holding ground is of good thick sand, but two anchors are recommended. + a A ground swell right up to the inner anchorage persists throughout the ^ is reliable, but marks are often diffi cult to distinguish owing to mist, and ships should not expect to find any buoys or beacons as all beacons an d buoy ed in 1939 have been removed by the natives and/or the weather. (c) Air Facilities. There is a R.A.P. Landing Ground and petrol stor ® southern shore of Sur-i-Masira lagoon, which is very shallow and approach by boat at low water entails much wading. The best way to reach the Landing Ground is to land at Ras Dha and walk overland. (d) Climatic Conditions. Considering the geographical position the climate m ^ st be considered very pleasant as there is nearly a wa y s ^ breeze. An H.M.Ship stationed there during September and October 1939 reported that the health of the Ship s company remained excellent in spite of no fresh fruit or vegetables being available. Pish and oysters are plentiful and good. Khor Kuwai and Vicinity. Khor Kuwai at the extreme northern end of the peninsula is a recreational base for the Persian Gulf Division of the Royal Navy.

In the meantime the War Subsidy Agreement was being negotiate,, and, in agreeing to its terns, the Government of India Suited that tiiey would not consider the restoration of the Arms Traffic Subsidy during the continuance of the War Subsidy, aiiu that alternatively they would ? a?ree to (the telegram in question was received corrupt) its renewal on txhe old conditions provided cne «»ar Subsidy were correspondingly reduced (paragraph 2 (ii) of External Affairs Department ’ telegram ■*o. l/l 1 -, daued 2nd Octoocr ih39). It Is probable that the Sultan, will, revive his claim Subsidy when.he sees the end of the da Even if he does not, he is due a reply in His Excellency the Viceroy’s letter dated Traff: o the Arms Subsidy in sight, continuation of 6th September 1939 mentioned in paragraph 5 above, and the question of the continuance oi the Arms Traffic Subsidy will have to be considers. ^ ^* Fifthly, with the aid of the War Subsidy, the Sultan has almost doubled the strength and improved the efficiency of his Levy Corps. Taking advantage of the Illness of the present Imam, the Sultan is at present engaged in delicate negotiations with important Shaikhs of the hinterland aoxx with a ., vi ?V-, to his long cherisned ambition of extending nis influence in the interior of Ova a. His success will favour our j.nterar;ts as it will facilitate penetration of this acca ;or oil development, anti-locust measures etc. The Sultan s success in these negotiations Ail , however, deoend largely on the extant to which the Shaikhs of the hinterland aie j.f pressed by the armed forces wnich the Sultan maintains, kuscat is not a wealthy State and ware tea Var Subsidy to cease without some compensatory iMeona, at least in part substitutio ,, it will not be possible for the Sultan*to main tain iris Levies at their present strength and efficiency. He is also anxious to employ through Government an Adviser for the whole State and an Administrator for Gwadur and to reform administration genera ly. It is to our interest to assist to staoilise his position and carry out reforms. his him I*. view of the foregoing considerations I am of o union unat the 'Aar Subsidy should continue t*o be paid for time longer, and in any event until a decision has been reached as to whether or not payment of the Arms Traffic Subsidy is to oa resumed. Should it be decided to resume the latter - conditionally or otherwise - a suitable occasion for announcing t.iis decision to the sultan woul i be when he will have to be notified of the termination of the War Subsidy.

India Office. ihe Meeting considered in order the five points referred to in paragraph 3 of Mr. Donaldson’s circular letter to Departments of 30th January. Ppr v/hat further period will the existing facilities under the War Subsidy Agreement be required? The Air Ministry and Ministry of Civil Aviation representatives said that their Departments would like to be able to use the facilities they at present enjoyed until the end of 1946. (Their requirements after this date are referred to in (b) below). The Air Ministry would not need facilities at Khor Kuwai and Gwadar after the end of this year. The Ministry of Civil Aviation representatives mentioned that a strategic service was at present in operation on the route Salalah-Masirah-Jiwani- Karachi but this would stop as soon as the military necessity ended. The Admiralty had no requirements at present, since Khor Kuwai had been transferred to the R.A.F., though the possibility of their requiring facilities at some future date could not be excluded. (^) What air facilities will be required in Muscat territory after the termination of the War Subsidy Agreement? The Air Ministry representatives said they were primarily interested in Masirah, Has al Hadd and Salalah. The R.A.F. would need the right to operate from, and keep strategic stores at, the airfields at these places an d to move in personnel as required. If the airfields could be maintained /bys - 2 - by civil aviation operators this would be so much the better. The M.C.A. said that it was difficult to foresee further than the end of this year, but they had no charter to operate uneconomic services and, when the present South Arabian strategic service was discontinued, they might have no further requirements on Muscat territory. It was mentioned that the Government of India had nearly a year ago put forward proposals for a new Muscat Civil Air Agreement. These proposals had not yet been definitely formulated for presentation to the Sultan. The M.C.A.'s requirements after the end of 1946 might be covered by this agreement if it was made in the name of His Majesty's Government as well as the Government of India, and a suggestion had recently been made for the obtaining of the R.A.F. 's requirements after this date by an exchange of letters to be appended to the Civil Aviation Agreement.

The Admiralty representative stressed the importance of keeping the Sultan of Muscat sweet. In a more confined emergency than the Second World War he might be less disposed to grant us the facilities required. It might pay us therefore, to keep up the War Subsidy under another name. The India Office representatives said that in view of the close and friendly relations between ourselves and the Sultan they saw no reason to doubt that he would give any reasonable facilities which might be required and pointed out that the payments which would probably be made for Civil Aviation / and} - 3 - and R*A.F. requirements after the end of 1946 would contribute • towards this end. In view of these assurances the Admiralty representative did not press his point. (e) Should a token gift of arms and ammunition be made to the Sultan on the termination of the War Subsidy, in recognition of his assistance during tbe war? It was agreed that as recommended by the Political Resident a token gift should be sanctioned subject to the concurrence of the Government of India and that the cost might most suitably be divided between His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India in the same way as the War Subsidy, i.e. in the proportion of 45 to 55* The India Office undertook to prepare and circulate for concurrence to the Departments represented a draft telegram to the Government of India to give effect to the conclusions reached and to elicit their views* rr India Office, S*W*1. 20th February, 1946. /“N /*/» °1 \ ♦ / Conf ia ent ial.

' There are one or two points on which I should like to make the Treasury view clear. (1) The War Subsidy is to be extended to the end of this year, but will then terminate. It was, I think, suggested that the Sultan should be informed to this effect, but this is a point of procedure which we are content to leave to you, provided that it is understood between us that payments will hot be continued into 1947. (2) I take it that you are pursuing, in consultation with the other interested Departments, the question of the approach to be made to the Sultan during the current year to secure such facilities as His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India will require in Muscat territory after the end of 1946, and that we shall be consulted again if it is proposed that His Majesty’s Government should contribute to any payments to the Sultan after that date. (3) I should like to have it on record that the proposed gift of arms to which I agreed at the Meeting was valued at approximately £2,000. I am sending copies of this letter to Dodds (Admiralty), Stileman (War Office), Humphreys-Davies (Air Ministry), Jones (Ministry of Civil Aviation) and Wikeley (Foreign Office).
