Resident in the Persian Gulf, Mr.Baxter 1 s ofiicial letter of the 19th January, No.E.5861/150/91, and his demi-official letter of the 6th April,No. E.2492/108/91, regarding the possibility of finding means to break the present deadlock in the dispute with Ibn Saud over the south-eastern frontiers of Saudi Arabia. 2. The views of the Government of , India and of the Political Resident have been communicated in letters dated respectively the 15th June and the 30th June, copies of which are enclosed herewith. Neither authority has found it possible to support the proposed offer to submit the dispute to arbitration. The Government of India feel considerable doubt whether an offer of arbitration would be welcome even to Ibn Saud himself, and both they and the Political Resident consider that, having regard to the nature of the relationship between the Arab Sheikhs and H.M.G. (a copy of thel' Vt j 1 2 . Resident’s letter of 17th March 1939 on this subject, to which he now refers, wa^ sent to you with India Office letter No. p. Z.2110/39* dated the 28th April), the mere suggestion to the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi that were contemplating arbitration in respect of territory which they had recognised as his for over 60 years would have a very damaging effect on their general position in relation to the Arab Sheikhs of the Persian Gulf. The Political Resident adds the warning that the submission of the Khor al Odeid issue to arbitration would constitute a most dangerous precedent for the disposal of other claims to the territories of Persian Gulf Rulers who enjoy the protection of H.M.G. 3* Apart therefore from the substantial difficulties which would arise with regard to the choice of arbitrators and to their terms of reference and in respect of the scope of arbitration proceedings, Lord Zetland regrets that, in the light of the opinions of the local authorities, he cannot undertake to solicit the consent oi trie Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, which he would regard as a condition precedent to any further consideration of the suggested offer of arbitration. The Sheikh of Abu Dhabi stands to gain nothing from arbitration,for at present his position is guaranteed by H.M.G., W&lt;$\' O'Department and he wenrtd hayc cvci-y trjrf-ioa'tl&amp;n asking what security he would have in the future against encroachments on the rest of his territory, if he did agree to arbitration and the award went it j- against him, since the mere fact that 11 .M.G. had^go&amp;e- back on their guarantee in respect of the Khor al Odeid showed that no similar undertakings could be relied upon. Lord Zetland feels that to arouse doubts of this kind as to our good faith in the minds of the Arab Rulers in the Persian Gulf - and there can be no doubt that the feeling of uncertainty could not be confined to the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi alone - might be no less dangerous at this juncture to our interests in the Middle East from the strategical point of view than the risk of giving [affoftee-4io the Saudi 'Arabian#, if we maintain our attitude. He finds it difficult, moreover, to believe that a refusal to meet hi-s wishes in this matter would seriously prejudice H.M.G. f s relations with Ibn Saud who, b as the Political Resident points out. did not consider it necessary to refer to the frontier dispute in the letter which he addressed to the Prime Minister early this year. He can-only suggest,4. therefore, that this question should he allowed to rest where it is for the time 4 'being,in the hope that the baudi Arabian Government will he content not tb press the matter further. If, however,; /Am* QknUA &lt;\(Ua+ tt, it should become necessary to give them a definite answer, it should be to the effect that after the fullest consideration H.M.G. regret that their undertakings to other Rulers render it impossible for them to entertain the claim of the Saudi-Arabian Government to territorial concessions in the Trucial Coast area. Lord Zetland hopes that Lord Halifax will accept this view, to which after due consideration of all the circumstances he can see no alternative. 4« Copies of this letter are being sent to the Departments represented on the iviiddle Last (Official) Sub Committee of the C.I.D.

As far as the Aden Protectorate is concerned the boundary affected is that of the eastern part of the protectorate, and I have accordingly consulted Ingrams with regard to the question you have put. I enclose a copy of his reply, and I agree with what he has said. If we can be certain that the arbitration will be perfectly fair and impartial, I see no objection to it, X but if there is any risk of considerations of political expediency being allowed to influence the decision, I should be against it.

My dear Sir Bernard, Thank you for your secret letter of the 8th May regarding the proposed South Eastern frontiers of Saudi Arabia. Fortunately I am not called upon to discuss the matter of Khor al Obeid itself and I take it that the question as it concerns us is whether the matter of what should be the boundary between the Hadhramaut State and Saudi Arabia should be submitted to arbitration or not, and perhaps who should be eligible as arbitrators or not eligible. I am firmly of opinion that the inclusion of the Kurab,Sei*ar,Awamir, Manahil and Mahra in the Protectorate is legally and naturally right on the following grounds: (1) their dependence on treaty chiefs by former agreements. ( 2 ) the geographical dependence of their areas on the Hadhramaut itself and the general ,f lie of the land', i.e., the existence of the natural boundaries between us and the Yemen and Saudi Arabia. ( 3 ) their economic dependence on the Hadhramaut. (4) A ground that we have not taken into consideration before, namely that during the past two years our links with them and contact with them have become much clearer and this in pursuance of a definite wish expressed by His Majesty s Government and of the v/ish of the people. ( 5 ) On the other side there are no reasons for neither Saudi Arabia or the Yemen have had any real contacts in recent history with these areas. I don 1 t see that we are called upon to take into consideration the independent Arab view that LIEUTENANT-COLONEL SIR BERNARD REILLY, K.C.M.G., C.I.R., O.B.E.,i 5 that as much of Arabia as is possible should be in independent Arabia whether it likes it or not Holding therefore that our case is legally and morally right, it would be illogical to object to arbitration and I have no objection to it if these are the sort of grounds on which the case is to be decided. But if it is to be within the competence of the arbitrator or arbitrators to consider whether to make an equitable decision all round and to give territory from one of the parties on one side in order to make up for a bit retained by another or inexpediency” is to be taken into account, then I would be strongly against it. You cannot expect, e.g. the Qu r aiti Sultan or a Sei f ar chief to think it reasonable that part of his territory should be put under Ibn Saud in order that the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi or the Sultan of Muscat, or an Omani Chief should be satisfied. As to arbitrators, I should think that if it is at all possible, the matter could best be decided by the Permanent Court of International Justice. I do not think the arbitrator or arbitrators should be Muslims: even if they were “disinterested” Muslims, e.g. Iraqis, they would be far more likely to decide in favour of Ibn Saud rather than in favour of a chief under British protection.

The Government of India have therefore again examined their records and I am to state the results of that examination, since at least* as ear ay as rS/ ? nis iiajesty r s Government or the Government of Inaia have consistently ma^intained that the SheiKh of sbu iliabi r s claim to hhor-el-Odeid was incontestable.

In this connection I am to ^ invite attention to paragraph 7 of telegram Ho. 70 fr om 3^ the Foreign Office to His majesty's minister at Jeddah and also to the recoras of conversations with Fuad Bey Hamza which took place in London and Riyadh in June and November 1935. In view of these facts it would obviously come as something of a surprise to Ibn Baud, if His majesty's 'TtlcuUl cun' Government, offer to submit trie question to arbitration and. \ he would look carefully at the implications before accept ing tiie offer* In trie first place he would naturally consider what grounds he could himself put forward or had advanced hitherto in support of his claim. Liter careful examination of trie previous correspondence the Government of India find that Ibn Baud's claim to whor-el- 0 aeid was first made in a statement enclosed with His Majesty's minister Jedda's despatch i qo• 109,^ dated the /on imm ii ^0*4* ^935 to the Foreign Office. Ho grounds in support of tne claim are stated there out Sir indrew Ryan recorded tnat Fuad Bey Hamza in oral discussion at the time based me 3 claim on King ibdul iziz's desire to stop smuggling through I ihior-el-Cdeid into Saudi-^irabian territory.

It may therefore be presumed that Ibn Baud, knowfiirg the weakness of his claim, would suspect that His Majesty*s Government*s offer of arbitration was merely intended to defeat his claim and he would either decline tne offer or, if lie accepted it, be annoyed at naving been aecoyea into an obvious trap* 3&lt;&gt; The reactions, of the Sheikh of hbu Dhabi to a proposal for arbitration are perhaps rather for trie resident in tne Persian Gulf to estimate than for the Government of India and Dir Trenchard Fowls r s comments have not yet been received. The Sheikh may not of course have any knowledge of Ibn baud's claim to ilior-el-Odeid nor of the attitude hitherto talien up oy nis majesuy s Government towards that claim but he must be aware of the support which nis own claim has received from his majesty* s Government against all other claimants for a great many years and also of course of the guarantee of , 1905.

I have the honour to report that Sheikh Zaid bin Khalifa, Chief of Abu Dhabi, has written to me requesting permission to reoccupy Odeid. 2. Then I visited Abu Dhabi last October, the question of Odeid came up during my meeting with the Sheikh, who appeared to be somewhat anxious regarding the reported intention on the part of the Turks to send a Mudir to that place. 3. Early in January I received a letter from Sheikh Zaid on the subject, and the Assistant Political Agent also wrote to me forwarding copy of a letter addressed to him by the Sheikh. Copies of these letters are herewith submitted for your information. It may perhaps be thought on a perusal of the Chief's letters that I had expressed a wish that he should rebuild Cdeid. This is not the case. I merely asked the Chief in course of conversation, in which he laid stress on his right of ownership of Odeid, if he thought he was in a position to reoccupy the place. The Chief said that he would have to think the matter over. 4. On receipt of the Chief's letter, I considered it advisable before submitting the request for the consideration of the Government of India to enquire from the Chief if he thought he was strong enough to hold the place, as in 1892, when Colonel Talbot,‘then Resident, spoke to him on the subject he had said that he was not strong enough to hold his own against the Bedoins. I have now received the Chief's reply which is to the effect that he cannot rebuild Odeid unless he is assured of/I. 2. of the approval and support of His Majesty's Government. he aoes not a PPear to anticipate any difficulty of holding ms own against the Bedoins, but what he evidently desires is an assurance of our support in case of interference by the Turks or by others instigated by them. 5. It is not necessary for me to enter here on any discussion regarding the right of the Chief of Abu Dhabi to occupy Odeid. nis rights of ownership are undoubted, but the point for considera tion is whether the reoccupation by him of the place at the present time may not be a cuase of inconvenience as imposing upon His Majesty's Government the obligation to protect the new settlement from hostile attack by sea. I am not inclined to think that this danger is very great. On the other hand the occupation of Odeid by a Trucial Chief is likely to be advantageous from our point of view, as it would finally put a stop to the pretensions of the Turks, and, as pointed out by Mr. Gaskin, would probably promote our trade interests. It seems to me that there is no sufficient reason why the place should remain for ever unoccupied, and I think that the Chief of Abu ?0habi might be given the permission for which he asks. 6. I have informed the Sheikh that his request has been referred for the consideration and orders of the Government of India and that meanwhile he should make no move in the matter. Translation of a letter, dated 4th Shavval 1321 (= 24th December 1903) from Sheikh Zaid bin Khalifah, Chief of Abu Dhabi, to Lieutenant-Colonel C.A. Kemball, C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. With reference to your wishes regarding the proposed rebuilding at Odeid, I shall count upon your valued support in case/3 20 case any objections are raised against the project, and I trust, that, you will oe good enough to continue your good graces in my favour. You are no doubt aware that the place is within the limits f ny territory and belongs to me, but X fear some one at this juncture may come forward and question my right to the place. Whatever you may deem expedient in the matter will be carried out, so I am awaiting your reply. mnmnm No. 6, dated 9th January 1904. r’roio - J. Calcott Gaskin, Esq., Assistant Political Agent, Bahrein, - Lieutenant-Colonel O.A. Kemball, G.I.E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to forward in original with a translation for your information a letter, dated the 1st January 1904, I have received from Sheikh Zald bin Khalifah, Chief of Abu Dhabi, on the subject of his rebuilding Odeid which matter was discussed by you with him on the occasion of your tour to the Arab Coast in October last. The rebuilding of Odeid will have a detrimental effect on A1 Bidda and Wakra, from which places it will draw some of their residents. Odeid possesses one of the most secure harbours for native craft on this side of the Persian Gulf. It v/ill become a centre for the pearl trade in that region much to the disadvantage of Al Bidda which now has a large share of the trade on account of its proximity to the central x^earl banks. A new market will be opened for our enterprising British Indians who will probably share in the Katr pearl trade which is now exclusively in the hands of Sheikh Ahmed bin Thani and his nephe¥/s. The port is situated about thirty miles nearer to Bahrein than to Abu Dhabi for sailing vessels, so that possibly it will draw some of its supplies from Bahrein. And finally it will put an effectual stop to Turkish pretensions to it. The/\ • i, i l- ; 4 4. Tne extra responsibility devolving upon His Majesty’s Government by the venture may be described as nominal only. After the severe check received by the Turks in their attempt on Bahrein 1895 they will hardly lay themselves open again to any similar demoralizing rebuff by instigating the Katr Arabs to attack Odeid by sea and should they be so ill-advised as to do so, ohe Arabs of that region are not likely to listen to them after 1 they experienced on the occasion referred to. The only other danger is that it may be open to attack from the land sine oy raiding Bedoins. The nearest water-supply accessible to an hostile party is in the vicinity of Wajba about fifty miles away, so that an attempt would be attended with serious risks, the contingency is therefore remote in the extreme. I am sending a reply to Sheikh Zaid by the messenger who Drought his letter, uo the effect that the letter has been sent on to you and that you will probably communicate with him on the subject. Translation of a letter, dated the 1st January 1904, from Sheikh Zaid bin Khalifah, Chief of Abu Dhabi, to J. Calcott Gaskin, Esquire, Assistant Political Agent, Bahrein. Let it not be hidden from you that, with reference to the matter regarding the building of the town of Odeid mentioned by you at our parting when the Political Resident was present, I am obedient to carry out the same and now have resolved to rebuild the place. It is begged and hoped of God and the British Government to increase their splendour and extend their benevolence towards me. I wished to inform you of my resolve so that you may know of it as I am confident in God and then you for your gracious assistance. Please God.

If the Sheikh were now again to people the place, it is probable that the settlers would again secede and would form a fresh cause of embarrassment to Sheikh Zaid. 3. From the point of view of British interests there appears at present to be no reason why the Government of India should lend their support to the enterprise.

There will be no reason for wishing to establish a port to rival those of El Katr and indeed it will probably be inadvisable that the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi/6 .

For the above reasons the Government of India are inclined fco think that in present circumstances the place should be left uninhabited and that, unless there are other strong reasons which have nou been mentioned, there are, at the present time, no sufficient advantages in lending any encouragement to the re-occupation of the place by the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi.

Please see the minute at P.Z.462* The Foreign Office have now sent us their proposals for submitting the question of the Khor-el-Odeid to a arbitration^in writing. Their letter is/lengthy and involved document which indulges in a great deal of specious argument in support of the proposal that we should he prepared to go hack on our guarantee given to the Sheikkof Ahu Dhabi in 1906. Put briefly the Foreign Office proposals amount to the following:- (1) As both sides have reached a point at which all further concession is entirely impossible, and as Ibn Saud is unlikely to agree to let matters rest where they are, the only proper course left open is to agree upon arbitration by a third party. (2) The Foreign Office would prefer to limit the scope of the arbitration as far as possible, but realise that it might be necessary, if the Saudis press it, to submit the whole frontier to arbitration. (3) Arbitration might be * (a) limited to the purely legal question of who is the rightful owner of the Khor-el-Odeid, or (b) on more general lines with the object of deciding who, on the most just and equitable solution^ ought to be recognised as the possessor of the territory. (4) As to the choice of an arbitrator, this might be the Permanent Court oi International Justice if alternative 3(a) is adopted; failing that it might be possible to find a single arbitrator by agreement or for preference three arbitrators, one selected from each side and the President chosen ■by/ (6610) Wt.25956/235 10,000 9/38 A.&amp;E.W.Ltd. Gp.685•by the first two. It would he desirable to exclude from the list.of possible arbitrators nationals of Prance, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia and the U.S.A. and possibly some other States also. (5) H.M.G. would not be entitled to offer arbitration without consulting their client Abu Dhabi. The Foreign Office, therefore, ask that he should now be warned that H.M.G. may find it necessary to agree that the question of his frontier,including the section near the Khor-el-Odeid, should be submitted to some form of peaceful settlement such as arbitration: that if this happens H.M.G. will support his claims to the utmost of their ability and that if such arbitration eventually leaves him, as.it surely will, with a clearly defined frontier T«5p«ct which Saudi Arabia has undertaken to this will conduce far more strongly to the security of his Sheikhdom than the present state of affairs. If the Sheikh objects strongly, or asks whether there will be any guarantee by H.M.G. for the new frontier, the question will have to be considered further. Taking these points in order, the Foreign Office ■base their whole case on the beliejC# that Itm Saud will not be content to let the matter rest indefinitely and ohat in the present world situation it is assent: that we keep him well disposed towards us. It is, however, highly questionable whether Ibn Saud really attaches so much importance to this question. He has raised it many times and no doubt will continue to do so.

On the contrary his recent letter to the Prime Minister suggests that what he is anxious about is to make certain of support from this country should he he attacked. It may also prove to he the case that the opening of his new port at Ras Tanura will make him attach less importance to an outlet at the Khor-el-Odeid. There is too, the further point that desirable as it may he to keep Ihn Saud well disposed, it is of equal importance for strategic reasons that the Sheikhs of the Arab coast should he friendly and ready to assist in time of war in vie?/ of our air communicauicns and oil interests in the country. If the result of making concessions to Ihn Saud over the Khor—el—Odeid should he to render Abu Dhabi hostile and weaken our prestige in the Gulf generally, as bir T» Powle has said it would, this might he just as serious to our interests as the ill-will oi Ihn Saud. The Air Ministry have informed me orally that they take this view of the matter and should there he any question of our modifying our attitude they would desire to he brought into any further discussions that may take place. As to (2) it would not matter very rrrach to us whether the scope of the arbitration is limited to the Khor-el-Odeid or extended to the whole frontier. As to (3) the Foreign Office devote^ 8 paragraphs (20 - 27) to discussion of this point. The argument is somewhat involved hut it seems to amount to this jc wo onfined to the strictly legal question of owners mid he fair to Ibn Saud (presumably they must think that his claim in law is weak) but on the other - lan d they are advised that H.M.G. could not in accordance with the guarantee of 1906 make trie oheikh a^ree to an arbitration which might have the result of deciding that though the Sheikh’s legal claim is good ; the territory should go to Ibn Saud on other grounds. Accordingly they suggest what they call a combination of both forms of arbitration,though this only seems to amount to saying that if the arbitrators find that neither side has a legal title then the matter should be judged on its merits. It is perhaps not worth while pursuing this aspect of the matter at this stage nor the question who would be a suitable arbitrator (point (4)), though this, if it were ever to be a live issue ; might give rise to very considerable difficulty. with regard to point (5) Mr. Walton pointed out in his note on P.Z.46S that the Foreign Office had not wp-to nint timm 'asked us to explore the possibility of obtaining Abu Dhabi's consent to the cession of the Khoi-el-Odeid,which would have been a not unreasonable request. The Foreign Office now definitely ask that the Sheikh should be sounded on the question of arbitration. If the proposal is to be further pursued there is no doubt that this would have to be the first step. it is to be anticipated, however, that the political authorities in the Gulf will see very grave objections to raising the matter with the Sheikh at all. They will almost certainly say that the mere mention of the possibility of our going/B Minute Paper.

And the news will get round at once to the other Sheikhs who will equally be alarmed for their position, with dire results to our prestige^ and also inevitably to Ibn Saud who may be trusted to exploit the position for all it is worth.

But in any case we are quite conscious that there is another side to the question, to which, as you will have seen, we drew attention in our letter to the Foreign Office of 7 th October, 1938, viz.- that important as it may be to retain Ibn Baud’s goodwill, it is of equal importance for strategical reasons, in view of our oil and air interests in the ^ulf, ana especially in case of an emergency, that we should do nothing which might weaken our prestige or cause the Arab rulers in the Gulf to feel ill-disposed or suspicious towards us.

The main consideration that explains the persistence of the Foreign Office on this question is their desire, in view of the present international situation, to preserve the goodwill of Ibn Saud^ and you will see that in p-ra. 7 of their official letter of 19th January they say that ”it would appear that, except for the question of Palestine, this frontier dif ficulty/ V.difficulty is regarded by Ton Saud as the most serious difference now existing between himself and il.lI.G.'

It may assist the discussion of this problem if I set down in the present letter some ideas v/hich have occurred to us for a procedure whereby this question might be, if not finally solved, at any rate prevented from reaching a deadlock. 3 . It seems to us that, when two parties have done all they can to reach agreement upon a point in dispute ENCLOSURE !N AIR MAIL LETTER between J.C. Walton, Esq.. C.B., M.C No. ) b !$ ■ IA u!' N u c a - t ' COPY SENT TO■between them, and can do no more because each side has reached a point at which it finds all further concession to be entirely impossible, the proper and perhaps the only way of composing the difference is for the two parties to resort to the arbitration or mediation of some third party. 4. If in the present case anyone can think of a better solution or a better procedure, or if the Saudi Arabian Government shows itself to be disposed to let the matter rest, \,q shall he only too glad; hut y/e ourselves see no other procedure and we do not think we can rely upon the Saudi Arabian Government letting the matter rest indefinitely e The ambitions of the oil companies on either side, if nothing else, may he too strong for them* 5. We realise, hoy r ever, that the idea of arbitration is in the present case beset by many difficulties, which larised under the following heads: The scope of the arbitration; The nature of the arbitration; The choice of the arbitrator; and - the most important of all - The effect of the offer or acceplanee of arbitration upon our relations with the Sheikh of Abu may be sumi (a) (b) (c) (a) ! Dhabi*6 0 As regards (a), we should clearly want to keep the scope of any arbitration within as narrow limits as possible. ffe might for instance start off by suggesting to Ibn Saud that if he were willing to accept what we had already offered for the rest of the South-Eastern frontier, e.g. the Qatar section (including the loss of the Jebal Nakhsh), the rest of the Abu Dhabi section, the Muscat section and the Aden Protectorate section, v/e for our part would be willing to submit the question of the Khor-el- Odeid to an independent .judgment. It must be admitted, however, that tnis might not seem a very tempting offer to Ibn Saud. He might feel that he was being asked to accept v/hat we offered everywhere else in return for at the most an even chance of getting v/hat he wanted near the Khor-el- Odeid. 7 0 If this proved to he his attitude, it would he difficult to deny that the same principle which applied to the unsettled problem of the Khor-el-Odeid applied also to the unsettled problem of the frontier as a whole, and that for this as for other unsettled problems arbitration was the right course,, It might therefore be necessary for us to agree in the last resort that the whole frontier, if it could not be settled otherwise, should be submitted to arbitration:arbitration; and we should clearly have to he prepared in our own minds to agree to this from the outset. 8 . As regards (b), a question of fundamental importance at once arises: (1) Is the arbitration to adhere strictly tp* legal principles, with the object of deciding who in law is the rightful owner of the territory concerned? or (2) Is the arbitrator to proceed on more general lines, with the object of deciding who, taking all relevant considerations into account (including the legal position, but only as one among several elements) ought, on the most just and equitable solution, to be recognised as the possessor of the territory? 9 . In the peculiar conditions of the area concerned, ( 2 ) would almost certainly be the more fair and the more sensible alternative, but ( 2 ) also raises special difficult! in regard to (d), with which I will deal further on. 10. As regards (c), we have no strong feeling about who the arbitrator (or arbitrators) should be. It would clearly/S'. clearly be desirable to exclude Prance, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Soviet Union and the United States of America, or nationals of those States. Possibly there are some other States or nationalities whom we should also wish to exclude. if the list of our objections were a long one, we could make a list of States or nationalities which would be acceptable to us and ask Ibn Baud to make his choice. etjut- (tills*!*) There would, we suggest, be no particular objection to having other Moslem Powers or Moslems included in the list. If a Moslem State or a Moslem were selected, it or he would presumably have to take account of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi* s feelings just as much as those of Ibn Saud. 11. It is probable, however, that a State would in any case be an unsuitable choice, especially for alternative (1) in paragraph 8 ; for (1) the Permanent GOurt of International Justice would be much more suitable. If Ibn Saud did not like the Permanent Court, it might be possible to find a single arbitrator by agreement, or, if this proved impossible (or indeed for preference) three arbitrators, one selected by each side (which would enable Ibn Saud to pick an Arab) and a President chosen by the first two. The exclusion of certain nationalities could be made to apply to all three arbitrators or to the President/President only* l2o As regards (d), we understand to the full the difficulty in which the India Office or rather His Majesty’s Government as a whole are placed hy the fact that we promised the Sheikh of Ahu Dhahi in 1906 that His Majesty’s Government recognised the Khor-el-Odeid as heing his territory and ^ere prepared to prevent its occupation hy anyone else. But the question must, we suggest, he regarded in the following light, 13 0 The dispute about the Khor-el-Odeid consists of two parts:- (i) an actual dispute betvfeen His Majesty's Government as the representative of the Sheikh of Ahn Dhahi on the one side and Saudi Arabia on the other, (ii) a potential dispute between His Majesty's Government as the guarantor of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi on the one side and the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi on the other. In other words His Majesty's Government stand in relation to the Sheikh in two separate capacities: as the Power which is internationally responsible for his actions and as the Power vdiich is responsible to him only for the Khor-el-Odeid.1 % 7 16 Khor-e1-Odeido 14 c . To take (i) first, the fact that His Majesty’s Government told the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi in 1906 that they regarded a certain area as lying in his territory does not in itself constitute proof that it did lie in his territory or invalidate any claims which a third party may have to it. If therefore a third party, e 0 g. Saudi Arabia, has claims to territory which is also claimed by Abu Dhabi His Majesty’s Government, in their capacity as the Power responsible for Abu Dhabi, must - if they are to act as sincere friends of the third party or even as ordinary good neighbours - take all reasonable steps to reach a just settlement, without regard to the difficulties which their actions may involve for them in their capacity of guarantor. 15. Furthermore, in the present case an entirely non - possumus attitude is likely to prove impossible, or at any rate most inexpedient in the present state of world affairs. His Majesty’s Government are in short in a position where they cannot afford to refrain from taking any reasonable steps which may still lead to a just settlement of this particular dispute and as there is such a step which it is open to them to take, ioe, an offer of arbitration, they ought clearly to take it.J-Qo To turn now to ('ii') i-r • If it IS a fact that His iwgesty s Government cannot give Ibn Sand n + u ve ibn Saud what he asks, or even offer him a procedure by which he s+a a ^ wnlc “ he stands a chance of getting what he asks if he can make out a good enough case, without thereby breaking, or taking the risk of breaking, a Pledge to the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, His Majesty's Government must evidently find some way of compensating the Sheikh in other directions, '/hat form this compensation might take need not, X think, be discussed here, but before deciding that compensation would be not only expedient (it would probably be that in any case) but also morally incumbent upon us as a result of the pledge, we are entitled to consider what the pledge really means. l 7 ” The P led Se is clearly a pledge to use our best endeavours to prevent the occupation by any other ruler of an area of undefined extent adjoining the Khor-e1-Odeid. But the form of our endeavours must equally clearly vary with the circumstances. If an attempt is made by a third party to occupy the area by forcible methods, including for our present purpose what is commonly understood hy infil .ration'’, we are under an obligation to resist the attempt by forcible methods (although, as we have said in the official letter, we might find it almost impossible to carry out this obligation in the present state of world affairs),20. 9 . affairs). If 0 n the other hand an attempt is made to occupy the area by peaceful, that is to say diplomatic methods, we are, we suggest, under an obligation to resist the attempt by diplomatic methods. But if as the result of the employment of diplomatic methods, including, it may be, some form of arbitration or mediation,, the third party can make a good claim to the area, surely we do not under an obligation to resist the occupation of the area by that party by forcible methods. 18o In short, His Majesty’s Government cannot do more for their client than they, could do for themselves in similar circumstances, and the client cannot expect His Majesty’s Government to do more on his behalf than the intrinsic merits of his case permit. His Majesty’s Government can legitimately use all their resources to resist aggression, but the client cannot expect them to refuse to entertain a peaceful method of settling an international dispute. 19. Having said this much I ought to explain that it is only in regard to alternative ( 1 ) in paragraph 8 that we put forward the propositions enunciated in the last few paragraphs.20 o v /e are advised tliat, if the position is that Ibn Sand cares to dispute the legal title of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi and to claim that he is in law the owner of the territory, the 1906 pledge cannot possibly mean that we are bound to resist Ibn Saud’s claim by force and to refuse to submit the legal question at issue to arbitration, which would be the normal course a To do so would be quite inconsistent with the professions which we have made of our attachment to the principle of the pacific settlement of international disputes. 21. Bur we are also advised that the position is different if the arbitrator is free to take other than legal considerations into account, since in that case the arbitrator might decide that the Sheikh was the legal owner of the territory, and yet decide in favour of Ibn Saud on grounds which he considered to outweigh the purely legal aspect. We do not claim that we could, consistently with the 1906 pledge, make the Sheikh agree to an arbitration which might produce this result. 22. Alternative (l) must therefore be explored and this also has its difficulties. 23. In particular, Ibn Saud might contend that in the circumstances an arbitration confined to purely legal principlesf ! • //, 4S Principles would not be fair; and even if he did eventually accept the idea, it might he necessary, especially in view of the peculiar local conditions, to lay down certain legal principles on which the decision was to he based. There might be great difficulty in agreeing upon these principles, especially as it might well te tnat if they were laid down in a certain way, the decision mi^t be bound to go automatically in favour of one side or the other 0 24, Let us assume, however, that it would be possible to agree that the court, or the arbitrator, was to decide the question at issue on strictly legal principles, but to be free in doing so to take into account all or any principles known to international law. m this case the Court would be free to take into account not only questions of recognition, such as the 1906 pledge, but also questions of occupancy and effective control over greater or shorter periods of time. But where would the evidence be found for such matters? It seems quite possible that the Court might say that neither side had succeeded in making good its clainio 25 0 This being so, it seems to us worth considering whether a combination of alternatives (l) and (2) in paragraphUSc ft. paragraph 8 might not be evolved, especially as ( 8 ) seems, as I have said, the fairer- and more sensible alternative. It might be possible to arrange that a legal tribunal should be asked to say whether, according to the accepted principles of international law governing disputes to territory (.which the tribunal might be left to define for itself) such territory adjoining the Khor-el-Odeid as can fairly be comprised under the description 'Khor-el-Odeid' legally belongs to (a) the Sheikh, (b) Ibn Sand or (c) neither of the two, in the sense that neither could establish a title on these principles„ 26o If the verdict were either (a) or (b), that would put an end to the matter a But if it were (c), either the tribunal or some other body (because in that event a purely legal tribunal might not he suitable) should decide to whom the territory ought to belong, taking into account all the relevant considerations (which it might or might not he necessary to specify). 27, This course would avoid the main difficulty about the 1906 pledge, because the Sheikh could not lose theuh^° (1 legal cons-'..derations might make it seem fairer to Ibn Saud — although he has in fact claimed the territory on grounds which he would probably describe, if he thought about the point at all, as legal grounds c 28r, fe do not suggest that we should be entitled to’ offer any form of arbitration without consulting our client. On the contrary we think it desirable that he should be consulted and that an effort should be made to persuade him that a settled frontier, based upon effective control, which Ibn Saud had specifically undertaken to respect (and which His Majesty’s Government had specifically undertaken to guarantee, if it were decided that a landward guarantee were possible) would be of much greater advantage to him than the present uncertain state of affairs. 29 0 The Sheikh might admittedly ask whether a guarantee by His Majesty’s Government of his new frontier could be relied upon, seeing that their guarantee of the Khor-el-Odeid had not sufficed to retain it in his possession, or at any rate to prevent it from being exposed to the chance of passing out of his possession. Strictly speaking this question could not be asked unless His Majesty’s Government had felt obliged to proceed to arbitration v/ithout the Sheikh’s concurrence, a situation ■which we may hope need never arise. But if it did arise. it31 • it coulcl 'bs o q- +. t 'i ed that although His Majesty's ^ 7 ' ^ d - obligation they had obligation of far cr r »ata„ ov + utilitv , ° tSnt and far practical utility, and that in so fan ac „ ' ' ° P rece dent was created at aJ-u, it was a precedent which nrr Provided every safeguard or the interests of Abu Dhabi. 30.

Lord Halifax regrets that the Government of India should have felt it necessary to maintain their opposition to the proposal put forward in the Foreign Office letter of the 1st July 1938, whereby it might have been possible to reach a final agreement with Ibn Saud in regard to this frontier question. The rejection of the' Foreign Office proposal by the Government of India would appear to render it impossible to take advantage of the ''personal suggestion' made a year ago by the deputy Saudi Arabian Minister for Foreign Affairs, that a compromise might be reached if His Majesty’s Government were prepared to abandon to Ibn Saud whichever of the two areas, Jebel Nakhsh and Khor-el-Odeid, they considered the less important.

I am to point out in this connexion that while the Government of India are undoubtedly correct when they assert that the cession of Khor-el-Odeid to Ibn Saud would not in any way alter Ibn Baud’s attitude towards events in Palestine, it was not mainly on these grounds that Lord Halifax advocated a solution on the lines proposed in the Foreign Office letter of the 1st July last. A settlement of this difficulty frontier question was considered to he desirable for two reasons. In the first place the Secretary of State considered, and still considers, his proposals to be desirable on their own merits, and in the interests of c the Trucial Sheikhs. Secondly, Lord Halifax feels that a settlement of this question is most desirable from the point of view of British relations with Saudi Arabia. 4. It would appear from paragraph 3 (b) of the Government of India’s letter, that they do not regard the establishment of a fixed and agreed frontier with Saudi Arabia as likely to be advantageous to the Trucial Sheikhs. They suggest that Ibn Saud would be unlikely to respect a frontier line agreed upon between himself and His Majesty's Government* They think that even if Ibn Saud were prepared to agree to a bargain regarding the frontier, it is most improbable that he would keep his side of it. The Government of India, moreover, observe that the policy of Ibn Saud /inJ 'fuoo lutein AW tU&gt;u v*&amp;wu) in recent years has been to advance his influence and his rule gradually and almost imperceptibly towards the coast, in spite of protests by His Majesty’s Government. It is, however, precisely in order to arrest this process of encroachment that Lord Halifax considers it to be desirable to establish a fixed frontier between the Trucial Sheikhdoms and Saudi Arabia. It is the absence of a frontier that has enabled Ibn Saud to extend his influence gradually over territories and tribes owning no allegiance to any other ruler«, Hitherto the only boundary line in existence has been one fixed by His Majesty’s Government which he has not accepted. It is unfortunate, bub not altogether unreasonable, that in the circumstances Ibn Saud should have considered himself to be under no obligation to respect such a frontier. The position would evidently, however, be different if a new boundary line were established as a result of a freely negotiated agreement, and in the opinion of Lord Halifax there is no reason to suppose that Ibn Saud would not keep his side of the bargain in such a settlement, especially if the frontier thus laid down were a real frontier, that is to say if it did not include in Abu Dhabi territory any areas over which the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi did not exercise real and effective control Lord Zetland will no doubt agree that one of the main causes of the frontier difficulties v/hich have arisen in this part of Arabia in recent years has been the fact that His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India have in the past given undertakings to local rulers recognising them as the possessors of certain territories, when those rulers had in fact little hold over the territories in question, or have since lost such /influence l MS&amp;? zh, Hr W influence there as they formerly possessed. So far as is known, all the encroachments of Ibn Saud hitherto have teen not upon Ahu Dhabi territory but upon empty territory, or upon territory occupied by tribal chiefs owning no allegiance to any particular M? ■ i ruler • Id 5. If the frontier remains unsettled, this process of encroachments will no doubt continue. It is provable that lion Saud will extend his rule over further territories towards the Persian Gulf, at least until he encounters tribes and territory over which the Sheikhs of the Trucial Coast exercise genuine and effective control. If this proves to he the case, it may well he found that Ihn Saud will he able to extend his rule up to the shores of the Khor-el-Odeid. Lord Zetland will remember that Ibn Saud has already, in his conversations with Mr. Rendel and Sir Reader Bullard in March 1937, claimed that no one but himself could keep order at the Khor-el-Odeid, and that when crimes were committed there it was to him that people applied for redress. 6 . It is impossible to x^redict the action which His Majesty's Government and the Government of India would be able to take in the event of the occupation by Ibn Saud of the Khor-el-Odeid district, hut it is clear that, having regard to the general position in the Middle East, and to the international situation, they might not feel able to do more than make a diplomatic protest to the Saudi Arabian Government. In that event, the ultimate result might be fer more damaging to the prestige of His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India in the Persian Gulf area than the settlement proposed by the Foreign Olfice last July. A.7. Lord Halifax feels, moreover, that the prohlejn Should also be considered*th due regard to its important effect on British relations with Saudi Arabia. it would appear that, except for the question of Palestine, this frontier difficulty is regarded by Ibn Saud as the most serious difference now existing between himself and His Majesty's Government, it is clearly of the highest importance to retain Ibn Baud's good will if W e are to retain our position in the Middle East in the event of an international emergency. If His Majesty's Government and the Government of India, whenever the question is raised, show that their only wish is to leave the matter in abeyance for an indefinite period, while refusing to admit Ihn gaud's claims to the Jebel Nakhsh and the Khor-el—Odeid, it will he difficult to prevent Ihn Saud from feeling some resentment regarding what he will regard as the arbitrary manner in which his claims have been treated. Moreover, in an international emergency, it will be all the more easy for the enemies of evti 'jri A* f tk, KU * CM ' this country to influence Ibn Saud by promising him full satisfaction of his territorial claims if he will abandon his traditional policy of friendship with His Majesty's Government. 8 . Sir Reader Bullard has reported that this frontier question was raised with him during his visit to Riyadh in November, and that he could only say that the matter was still under consideration. It will be necessary now to decide on the reply to be returned to the Saudi Arabian Government when the matter is again raised. Lord Halifax hopes that it may be found practicable to devise some /alternativealternative solution of this problem which may offer some chance of an ultimate agreement acceptable to both Governments, and that it will not be necessary merely to reject the Saudi Arabian Governments suggestions without advancing any practical proposals for a settlement* I am to suggest that immediate consideration should be accorded to this question, and that it might be discussed orally at a very early date. 9.

He is impressed by the difficulty that the proposal could not be carried out without serious risk of damage, now and hereafter, to the strength of the position of His Majesty's Government in the Persian Gulf.

Moreover, even if His Majesty 1 s Government were willing to incur these risks, the probability that the proposed cession of territory would materially influence Ibn Saud^ attitude in the matter of Palestine is acknowledged to be remote and it is not even certain that it would secure a settled frontier with the Trucial Sheikhdoms. The chance that such a cession would have any weight in determining Ibn Saud^ policy in the event of a major emergency seems also to be very small, while on the other hand Imzeh an event would of course srreatlv emphasise the importancg^f^tfie risks to beap^ej^n^efr^onTit to His Majesty^ Sevsmmient * &amp; ^^stige~-i-i^-the-Pe-Psi an G-uif J Lord Zetland hopes, therefore that on further consideration Lord Halifax will agree that the proposal need not be pursued.

The (Government of India fully appreciate the importance of securing, if possible, Ibn Baud's benevolent neutrality towards His Majesty's Government's policy in Palestine and of removing any other grievance which he may have against His Majesty's Government. They have accordingly re-examined the matter in the light of the arguments put forward by the Foreign Office and have given those arguments all possible weight in considering whether they are justified in modify- ing the views expressed in their telegram No. 440 of 8 th March 1938. As the result of that re-examination they have regretfully concluded that they must adhere to the position which they then adopted and must again express their un- compromis ing opposition to the proposal made by the Foreign 8 SEP 1938 INDIA OFFICE Office. 3.- 2 o* i.t reasons lor tills conclusion ciay be sur/Fnarized as follows : (a) The Foreign Office themselves admit that, even if Ibn baud were induced by the cession of Khor-el-Qdeid to agree to a settled frontier vis-a-vis the Trucial States, the effect would hardly be permanent so far as Ibn Saud r s attitude to wards the Palestine question is concerned* The Government of India would go further and state that in their opinion no gesture of friendship on the part of His Majesty's Government will avail to prevent Ibn Baud and his subjects from actively assisting their coreligionists in Palestine, unless some appeasement of the situation there can be secured before long by His Majesty f s Government* Ibn Saud's present disposition is, so far as the Government of India understand it, to avoid any friction with Great Britain and, if he does eventually decide to add to His Majesty's Government's difficulties in Palestine, it will not be on account of chagrin at failure to obtain the Eastern and Southern Frontiers, which he desires, but because he is compelled to this course by pressure from the Moslem world in general, which he is not able to resist. The cession of Khpr-el-Odeid will not therefore, in the ooinion of the Government of India have any material effect upon Ibn Gaud’s behaviour with regard to Palestine either in the immediate or the remote future. Theyhold this opinion the more strongly because they do not consider that Ibn Baud would, be grateful or would regard himself as under any obligation to His Majesty's Government by reason of their allowing him to take territory which he regards as his bp right and not by favour; (b) The Government of India are by no means satisfied that the cession of Khor-el-Odeid would in fact result in the establishment of a fixed and agreed Frontier between Saudi Arabia and the territories of the Sheikh of Abu Dhaoi. Sven3 iiiVen if Ion oaud were prepared to agree to a bargain on these Imes, it is most improbable that he would keep his side of it* His experience hitherto has been that, by declining to agree to anything and always demanding more in reply to cuuy concession, he has oeen able to advance his influence and his rule gradually and almost imperceptibly towards the coast in spite of the protests of His Majesty's Government* It would not be obvious to Ibn Saud why a Frontier, to which he had agreed in theory, should, in practice be defended with more vigour than a Line which His Majesty's Government have on moi e than one occasion declared to be their last end final offer. It moreover appears to the Government of India that, if international complications in Palestine and elsewhere supervene, which would render Ibn Saud's friendship even ^ '^W**** more desirable than it is at present, His Majesty's Gowern- ment would feel compelled to acquiesce in further encroach* ment against the territories of the Trucial Sheikhs rather than risk an open breach with Ibn Saud by forcibly resisting it; (c) If however it be assumed that the advantages expect ed by the Foreign Office could in fact be obtained as regards both Palestine and the fixation of a definite limit to Ibn ‘ Saud's encroachment against the Trucial Sheikhs by the cession of Khor-e 1-Ode id, it remains to consider the means by which such cession could be arranged and the effect which it would be likely to produce upon the general position of His Majesty's Government in the Gulf. It would be necessary to secure the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi's acquiescence in the transfer of this territory and there can be no doubt that this could only be obtained either by the exercise of pressure amounting almost to force or by giving him pecuniary inducements of the order suggested in the Foreign Office letter. The use of the first method would have a most deplorable effect upon BritishBritisn prestige in the Gulf and in the Middle East, sin it would be regarded by all our dependents there as a surrender to Ibn Saud's aggression at the expense of one expense of one , since would m the opinion of the Government of India create a ■loso unfortunate precedent, since it would be known to everyone in the Gulf that the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi had been paid a large sum for his complaisance and it would be impossible in future for His Majesty's Government to obtaii anything from the Sheikhs without paying an exorbitant sum for it. 4. To sum up the Government of India consider that it would be impossible to arrange the bargain, which the Foreign On ice propose, without causing grave damage to the general position of His Majesty's Government in the Persian Gulf, and that the bargain if concluded would not secure either a settled Frontier for the Trucial Sheikhs against Ibn Saud's encroachment or any alteration in Ibn Saud's attitude towards events in Palestine. They therefore feel bound to recommend that the proposal should be dropped. 5. A copy of this letter is being sent to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, from whom no comments on vour letter No. P.Z. 4621/38, dated the 22nd July 1938, have been received. I have the honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient servant, Secretary to the Government of India.FOBSIGN OFFICE , S.W.l. 29th September, 1958. (E 2579/150/91) My dear Gibson, You may remember telling me a few days ago that you had received from the Government of India and the local authorities in the Persian Gulf replies to the further Foreign Office suggestions for the cession to Ibn Baud of territory adjoining the Khor-el-Odeid (our letter E 2579/150/91 of the 1st July). 2 . In the ordinary way, it would probably have been sufficient if a decision could have been reached upon this question in time for that decision to be conveyed to the Saudi Arabian Government by Bullard upon his return from leave, the object being to give a natural occasion for the notification of a concession which might otherwise seem to be made merely because His Majesty^ Government were in a particularly tight corner. Bullard was, until recently, to have gone back about the middle of November, so that there was no excessive urgency. It has now been arranged, however tha t/ J.p.Gibson Esq.82 / HuJ- that he shall leave for Jedda on Saturday 1 st October and '■■'HI he back, unless he meets with difficulties on the way, at his post in about three weeks' time from then. h. It is most desirable that we should if possible oe able to telegraph him instructions as to what he can say to the Saudi Arabian Government upon the subject of frontiers as soon as he is back and we therefore hope that it may be possiole to consider this question as early as possible.

The steps to be taicen appear to be as follows. first His Majesty's Government will nave to decide whether to adopt generally foreign Office's prpposal or not. Having done this then before approaching | the JiiaiKh they should get from Ibn oa'ud a definite statement in writing that should it be possible for to persuade tne ^iiia iicii to surrender Kli or- el— ud q id he will definitely a^ree to the proposed frontier# Jlae only guarantee we have at present that Ibn sa*ud would agree to a frontier:if he received Knor-el-Udeid is Fuad Hamza’s personal opinion given in Jeddah telegram \£&gt;%t Ho# 56 to Foreign Office 2# fhe Foreign Office (paragraph 7 of their letter) envisage the danger of Ibn 8a\iid absorbing most or all of the Crucial Coast hinterland H up to the very outskirts of the Trucial porta** and therefore a fixed frontier would be to our advantage as well as that of tne Shaikh of Abu Dhabi and generally tne bh&amp;ikhs of tne frucial Coast# This is true in itself but almost entirely on account of oil possibilities in that area. If we were sure that there was no oil there* tnen Ibn ba’ud’s penetration to places like Baraimi might be a nuisance but certainly would not have the importance it does at present provided he was kept at a reasonable distance fr om/from tne coast ^ or frontier to be of any use to us it seems to me that it must definitely be guaranteed in tne same way tnat the Kuwait-Jiaudi or ^atar-^audi J boundar iea are guaranteed* That is to sayx&amp;xx* tne lihaihiia of both these territories have been guaranteed by His Majesty’s Crovernment protection from agression across tnoir frontiers. fhis howe«r«r the foreign Office are not prepared to give without qualification. It is true that they are willing to give tne sane sort of guarantee to Abu Jnabi as His Majesty &lt; s Crovernment have given to Kuwait and qatar (vide last sentence of tneir paragraph ll), but earlier in the aai® paragraph they say that w it would clearly be undesirable tnat His Majesty’s Governj®nt should undertake any responsibility for intervening if some tribal elements on tne abu Dhabi side of the frontier cnose to repudiate tne onaiKh of Abu Dhabi and to declare allegiance to ibn Ha^d* 4 , This is exactly the sort of tactics that J-bn t&gt;a*ud would adopt for ^peaceful penetration 4 * of the frucial Coast Hinterland and it would s&amp;exxdy have to be made clear to ibn Sa’ud that any shifting of tribal allegiance would in no/w ay give the baud! brovernraent any right whatever beyond tne frontier fixed. 4. Thei'foreign Office argue (their paragraphs 12 and 13) (a) that since in any case we have to guard the air route along the Trucial Coast the guarantee of Saudi the Abu Dhabi/frontier would hardly be an additional commitment. Further (b) that if oil is found (tneir paragraph 14) in t hehinterland His Majesty*© Government wo uld/3 would inevitably be obliged to interest themselves in t he maintenance of that frontier. With regard to (a), for the security of this route we would only have to keep Ibn Sa? ud at a certain distance from the Coast but not necessarily from penetrating the hinterland at a considerable distance from it. With regard to (b) this argument certainly applies xixbyx if oil is found, but not otherwise. Foreign Office suggest (paragraph 10 ol t heir letter) that the sum of &amp; SSjODO/**, or even more, might be paid to the Shaikh of Abu Dnabi for the surrender of hhor-el-Odeid. In paragraph 3 of my telegram Mo.T/48, dated 2bth February 1938, I gave my view that it was impossible to compile what sum the an&amp;ikh would be likely to accept, and whether £ 2b,000/- is adequate or not I really cannot say. In paragraph 5 of the same telegram 1 gave my views as to the objections to our buying Khor-el-^deid from him and I need not repeat these. I also gave some further views in my note of 16th April 1938 to Mr. Gibs on. 6. In paragraph 17 of tneir letter tne Foreign Office suggest that in case the Bhaikh of Abu Dhabi proves obdurate in refusing to sell his territory His Majesty^ Government must insist on his following their advice. Tne Foreign Office grounds for this proposed action are that while *it would be wrong bring pressure to bear on any frucial bhaikh to act to/-4 l.».3h to hia own diaadvantage, In thia oaBe , a8 tn e sale “ or nia territory would beto hia advantage, therefore ne should Be made to do ao.» if there are atrong objections to the voluntary sale of a piece of hia veri itory by tne tihaikh of Abu Jihabi, there are obvioua- -1/ far stronger objections to a forced sale, »nd auoh a step would have a deplorable effect both locally and m tne neighbouring countries of Baud! Arabia (even' though the aaudi Oovernment would benefit by it) # Iran X \ and Iraq, and probably further afield through tne medium of the Arab Press, wno would doubtless get to f !k\ know of this action and make full use of it for anti- ‘i ' 'V -British propaganda.

We cannot believ that His Majesty’s Government stand to gain by leading Ibn Gaud to think The Rt.Hon.Viscount Halifax, K.G., G.C.H.I., l.C.l.M..

I do not minimise the importance of Ibn Baud’s good will and I am anxious to second your efforts to ensure it. But I feel the present proposal is unwise and prejudicial to our own interests, and I hope you will *gree not to pursue it further. ks regards the general question of the frontier and any in struct ion a which should now be sent to Bullard, I should see no objection to his suggestion (paragraph 4 of his despatch 137 of the 4th July) that we should * revert to the proposal for the visit of a ’topographical commission’ to the area adjoining the Jebel Kaksh.V &lt;s^ sV (E 2579/150/91) h '■ FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l. 25th August, 1938, 4-C3h 3g. 4-621 Dear Syraon, Would you please refer to our official letter E 2579/150/91 o f the 1st July regarding the possibility of ceding the Khor-el-Odeid to Ibn Saud? 2.

My Lord Jedda, July i, IMS. 1 MAVr, trie honour to transmit herewith, in translation, a note from the Saudi (jovernment, dated the 26th June, about the eastern frontier. It is a reply I ; ,je ] i K) ^ e &gt; u copy of which was sent to the Foreign Office with mv printed 3634-JJfr despatch No. 72, dated the 14th April, in which the right pf His Majesty’s Government to Seep tfieTArneriean'dircbmpany concerned informed of the frontier situation was reiterated, and it deals also in principle with the question of prospecting for oil in the disputed zone. It will be seen that the Saudi Govern ment do no more than repeat their offer to refrain from prospecting in the disputed zone until a frontier agreement is arrived at, provided that His Majesty’s Govern ment will ensure that a similar policy of abstention is observed from the Qatar side. 2. In my telegram No. 56 dated the 7th March, I reported Fuad Bey’s ‘ personal ” opinion as toHhe, sdrF of solution that might be acceptable to his Government. Fuad Bey went to Syria 'on leave soon after that, and had I been in a position to give him my views on his opinion, the reply was to be sent to him there. It is possible that the Saudi Arabian Government have been waiting for such a reply, but their reference to Fuad Bey may have resulted from their con sciousness that he is the only person in their employ who thoroughly understands the bilingual correspondence on this subject and can be trusted to write a clear reply. 3. The deadlock is still complete. The only hopeful feature in the situation is that the Californian Arabian Standard Oil Company are more and more inclined to believe that the oil-field in Flasa is extremely rich. If this belief is well-founded, Ibn Saud’s bitterness on the frontier question, in so far as it has an economic basis, should diminish with time, though an increase in his income will not make him less touchy on the point of prestige. 4. On looking through the file, I see that, owing to a regrettable oversight, the Saudi note which I summarised briefly in my telegram No. 40 of the 23rd Feb- ruarv was never sent to you. A translation is enclosed. 1 expect to proceed to England on leave in a few days, and this question can perhaps be considered once more while I am at home, though I have no useful suggestions to make. All we can do it seems is to revert to our proposal for a preliminary examination of the area in dispute,’ which is little more than a device by which we hope to convince the Saudi authorities that Jabal Nakhsh is an integral part of the small Jabal Dukhan range If the invitation which I have received holds good and I spend a few weeks at Ibn Saud’s camp in Nejd next spring, it might perhaps be possible to organise a visit to the Qatar boundary for this purpose.. , 5 I am sending copies of this despatch with copies of enclosures, to the Hrmonrable + he Political Resident in the Persian Gulf at Bush ire and the Secret to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department at ^ ra ^ a ‘ I have, &amp;c.

It never entered into the thoughts of my Government to bargain about the frontier which they put forward, for it was drawn after deep reflection and careful consideration; and it was on account of the insistence of the British Government that it was drawn so as to cover the very minimum of the just claims. Had my Government thought that it would be the subject of discussion and bargaining, they would have taken up a different position, whereas they limited their claims to the minimum, hoping that the British Government would not argue about it, but would accept it as a just and practical frontier in the interests of both parties. I do not conceal from your Excellency that my Government attaches the greatest importance to this frontier and regards it is a very vital matter. Nay, more : I can say that this question is a question of life and death in con nexion with that part of His Majesty’s dominions. They, therefore, regret exceedingly that the British Government do not appreciate their position at its true value; at the same time, however, they express their readiness to discuss any practical proposal which will secure the interests of both parties and obviate harm. As to the abstention by employees of the companies on both sides from encroaching on the disputed areas, the Deputy Foreign Minister in his personal letter of 3/12/1356 (the 3rd February, 1938) explained the essence of the position to your Excellency as mv Government understand it, and in it he explained exactly how the matter stood. 'l hope that there may be sufficient explanation therein to help to clear up the present misunderstanding and to bring about a fundamental solution of the difficulties. . . As to the question of the appointment of a topographical commission, His Majesty’s Government, before giving a definite reply to the request, would like to enquire from your Government as to the areas required to be surveyed in older that the matter may be sufficiently clear to both sides, and that the confusion whic might result if the agreement were general and not precise may be avoided. I await, therefore, the opinion of your Government on the three points set forth above. FEYSAL.Extract from Cabinet Conclusions 35 (38) dated 27th July 1938. Referring to conclusion (f) of the C.I.D. on the South-Eastern Frontiers of Saudi Arabia (That, with a view to the settlement of the S.E. frontiers of Saudi Arabia on lines acceptable to Ibn Saud, the Foreign Office and India Office should be authorised to take up tne question of the cession by the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi of a strip of territory in the Persian Gulf known as the Ehor-el-Odeid: and that, should compensation in the form of a cash payment prove necessary, the expenditure of a sum tentatively estimated at £25,000 for this purpose should be provisionally authorised, subject to the usual arrangements for obtaining Treasury sanction), the Secretary of State for India warned the Cabinet that the Government of India saw strong objections to the proposal to take up the question of the cession by the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi of a strip of territory in the Persian Gulf known as the Khor-el-Odeid, as they thought that this would have a serious effect on the Trucial Chiefs. He was prepared, however, to discuss the matter further with the G. of I. The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence, in reply to the Prime Minister, said that apart from conclusion (c) which had been reserved, the Cabinet need only ta^ce note of the remaining conclusions of the C.I.D. The Cabinet agreed : (a) To take note of the conclusions of the C.I.D. at the 329th meeting, subject to - (b) The reservation of conclusion (c) on the subject of a proposed contribution of £30,000 towards the reconstruction of the Saudi Arabia Section of the Hedjaz Railway until a meeting to be held on the following day: (c) That in the interval the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should ascertain whether H.M.Minister at Jedda, who is now in London, realised the conditions attached to the-.TiiSS PAKAGRaPH / &amp;&gt; ' ^'0 5“ ~u x; You may have seen by this time a copy of a long official letter dated 1 st July from the Foreign Office about the possibility of ceding to Ibn Saud certain territory adjoining the Khor-al- Odeid, which at present belongs to the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi. In paragraph 12 of his letter of the 6 th April Linlithgow asked that he should have an opportunity for comment if there was any question of taking this proposal seriously. I accordingly consulted him personally on the basis of the new Foreign Office letter and he has recorded a note of which I enclose a copy. We also asked your Government officially for observations on the F.O. letter and you will no doubt give due weight, in author ising the reply, to Linlithgow s personal observations. Halifax has sent me two personal letters on the subject, urging me to approach the proposal as sympathetically, as possible and I shall have to discussthe matter ^feo-r^ll-y with him in clue course, but the prospects of reaching agreement do not at present seem very favourable. The subject is coming up before the Cabinet in a preliminary way tomorrow in connection with various general proposals for influencing minor powers and Arab States in the Middle East whose assistance or even benevolent neutrality might be of value to us in time of war. The recommendation on this particular point is merely that the P.O. and I. 0 . should 'take up the question.'Mr. L^ithwaite, h'jkf Please see P.Z.4621/38 and the notes above it. Lord Linlithgow’s views expressed in his letter of 6 th April are at flag A. Perhaps you would state (a) whether these views are at all modified by the Foreign Office letter of the 1st July; (b) whether Lord Linlithgow would prefer to dispose of the matter by expressing his own views here or would like a reference made tothe Government of India, as the Department have proposed. In the latter event, would you wish me to say anything to Mr. Puckle in regard to Lord Linlithgow's own views on the present position?I have read the Foreign Office letter and the personal correspondence which has passed with Lord Halifax on this question and I have discussed it briefly with the Secretary of State. I fully recognise the anxiety of the Foreign Office to make some concession to Ibn Saud. But J -fear that I a*#-entirely unshaken in my very strong objection to any action of this nature. I am sure that it would be a profound mistake; I doubt very much if it would be likely to have the effect that the Foreign Office hope; I would anticipate that it would do us little good with Ibn Saud that he should think that we attach so much importance to him that we are prepared to go back on old engagements or to bring strong pressure to bear on one of our own protege's tomake territorial concessions of this nature; and I have no doubt whatever of the most unfortunate effect which any action of this nature would have on our prestige in the Gulf and in the Middle East, l am frankly surprised in this connection to see the argument in paragraph 18 of the official letter from the Foreign Office about prestige, v v n i u n - can no u but feel is entirely unconvincing.V ll- ^ , JT ' 7 ^ t cu ^ &gt; ’’• ^ ^ si -~^ £«£. i. JL A,:- S-'S,, In his private letter of 6 th April Lord 'l J/f »rt[ - ■r&lt; i‘^T tz wl .“fe in ' &lt;n&gt; IwiH? «&gt;7 /I Linlitligo^ stated that he would like an opportunity to comment if there were any question of taking these proposals seriously, and the Secretary of State, in his private letter of 10th May, said that he would certainly give the Tr iceroy the opportunity of further comment if the F.O. should return to the charge. As regards the question of procedure, one alternative is to write to the U-. of I. as proposed, and for the Secretary of State to send a private letter to Lord Brabourne drawing his attention to the official letter. Another alternative would be to discuss the ► matter with Lord Linlitfgow while he is in this country. Perhaps in any case we might inform Lord Linlithgow of the F.O. proposals, and if he feels that he would like the views of the G. of I. thereon we could then write to Lord Brabourne. Ultimately, whatever immediate procedure is adopted, it is for consideration whether the Secretary of State might not ask for a talk with Lord Halifax, in the hope that this might obviate the necessity of a aiscussion in the Cabinet or in the Ministerial Middle East/East Sub-Committee of the C,ID.(which would normally be the body to discuss a matter which, like this, has been discussed by the Official Sub-Committee without agreement being reached) . There is no hurry from our point of view, and if the matter is to be taken up in the Cabinet or the Ministerial Sub-Committee, it is for the F.O. to take the initiative. We could reasonably ask that this should nou oe aone before the G. of I. have had the opportunity of commenting on the proposals./y£ The proposal in the F.O. letter is that we should try to persuade the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi to give up the territory in consideration of the advantage to himself of obtaining a settled frontier with Ibn Saud (who, it is suggested, may otherwise extend his influence and his claims indefinitely)^ a»A of a money payment (if it i, s necessary to offer this) ^ Tne F.O. further propose that, if the Sheikh should prove obdurate, we should insist on his following our advice. As regards the proposal to insist, if necessary, tne KO. do not notice the difficulty of making such action square with our engagements to the Sheikh to j recognise the place as his, and not to let anyone else occupy it. The text and context of these engagements would have to be examined to see whether a proposal to insist on his ceding it could in any way be made compatible with them. But in any case, to force the Sheikh to give up what is his in order that we may please Ibn Saud would surely be a most questionable proceeding, and not likely to win us the respect of Ibn Saud/Saud himself. Of course, the F.O. may say that this question does not arise until we have tried out their first alternative of persuading the Sheikh. Their letter, however, does not dispose of the formidable objections felt by the Resident and the 0. of I, even to this course. f ~ tst In 4 jf Cn* / » t /uJ[E 3791/10/31] Copy No. 012 Sir H. Bullard to Viscount Halifax.—(Received June 27.) (No. 116. Secret.) My Lord, Jedda, June 6, 1938 YOUR secret telegram No. 72, dated the 26th May, informs me of an arrange ment by the party of the Mufti, apparently with the consent of Ibn Saud,°to put chase in Cxermany ammunition nominally for the Saudi Arabian Government but in reality for tne insurgents in Palestine. This compels me to change the opinion I held in regard to the alleged attempt to smuggle arms and ammunition into Palestine from Jauf (reported to me in Palestine telegram No. 75, dated the 27th April), which was that there would be no smuggling of arms at present with Ibn Saud’s connivance, and that it could hardly take place without his knowledge; and that if Ibn Saud eventually decided to support the Palestine Arabs otherwise than by giving private advice to His Majesty’s Government, the change of policy would take some more public form. I have reported on more than one occasion that Ibn Saud seemed unable to believe that His Majesty’s Government would persist to the end in their partition policy, and although little has happened during the last few months to encourage this belief it seemed probable that he would at least await the recommendations of the second Royal Commission before changing his policy of neutrality. An apologist for Ibn Saud might argue that to assist the insurgents with arms and ammunition, secretly, is no worse than to subscribe to insurgent funds, as many highly-placed Moslems in Iraq and Egypt have done, and that his conduct still compares very favourably with that of the authorities in Syria, or even in Iraq. Nevertheless, it would be dangerous to ignore any sign that Ibn Saud is giving the insurgents concrete help, and I have been going over the history of the last few months with the object of assessing the forces which may be tending to induce Ibn Saud to abandon his traditional policy of friendship towards His Majesty’s Government. 2. In the matter of Palestine, Ibn Saud, like other Moslems, is not only under the stress of political events, but is influenced by the dislike and suspicion of the Jews which is inculcated by the Moslem religion. In the first of the two enclosures to this despatch, I have given excerpts from despatches sent from this post during the last year or so, illustrative of Ibn Saud’s personal attitude towards the Jews, and above them I have placed a quotation from Mr. Philby’s first book : “ Ibn Saud in his more confidential moods will readily confess to an intense dislike for the Jews.” This dislike was not created by the Zionist policy of His Majesty s Government, which, at the time to which Mr. Philby’s book relates, consisted of nothing more than the little-understood Balfour Declaration, but was the natural feeling of a man soaked in the precepts of the Koran, which are full of hostility towards the Jews. The observer, who is neither Moslem nor Jew, may well consider Muhammad’s treatment of the Jews as a black page in his career, and may feel, when Moslems allege that the Jews have designs on Medina and Khaibar, that the allegation is a symptom of a guilty conscience; but however that may be, the fact must be faced that the Moslem who hates the Jew does so on the hig es mi tli run tv Via Vnnws VV Hi., X 5 [330 dd—3]2 „ ^ wf mood for the examination of the ment. Ibn Saud was, therefore not i ^ the 5th j anuary . It is ti^» despatch about Paiestme which wap^ from Ibn gaud’s point of view, that the despatch held out , “° , ‘ r f t that His Majesty’s Government would only particular in implying, as he t » ’ sa ] s cou ld be put before them which could go on with the partition sc eme P P , ^ / an impossibility in his opinion); but be considered both that all the time he was little occurred to support ni « h ^Thi, susuicion that His Majesty’s Govern- examining the despatch the hght ^ palegtine ^ It ls true ment are dominated by the J ■ , ,, Weizmann interview had been com- ‘f “po“ in w„h his mumcated to hmi P^ completely effaced by the repudiation. More- prejudices, and will no ] , speedily of the resolution carried unaiiimouslv 3 by ihs Executive Council of the' Zionist Federation on the 29th December which protested against any attempt to impose a minority status noon die Jews in Palestine or “ artificial ” restrictions upon Jewish immigration, affirmed the right of the Jews to the establishment of a Jewish State m Palestine and suggested that the Jewish State should eventually have a place within ,he framework of the British Empire. Nor will the public references to the second Royal Commission have given him much comfort, since they tended to minimise its functions and to suggest that partition in some form or other was a foregone conclusion. Even the change of High Commissioners m Palestine, which was generally interpreted as foreshadowing a “ firmer ” policy, must have helped to quench his faint hopes. And all this time, i.e., for some weeks before Pilgrimage Day (9th February) and some weeks after, Ibn Saud must have been subjected to tremendous pressure, supplementing the permanent pressure from the religious leaders of his own people, from Palestinians and Syrians and others who had nominally come to Mecca for the pilgrimage, but in reality to urge Ibn Saud to assist the insurgent movement in some way or other. We can be sure that he was reminded not only of his obligations towards his fellow Moslems, but of the fact that if the partition scheme went through he would probably have his enemy, the Amir Abdullah, as an independent ruler on his Hejaz frontier, and Akaba and Maan would be lost to him for ever. Pressure to induce him to take a public stand for Palestine was also being applied by the Yemen and Iraq Governments, and in the midst of the perplexities resulting from the conflict of all these forces with his earlier policy and instincts, there came the tremendous fact of the annexation of Austria. 4. Ibn Sand would take it for granted that many of the Austrian Jews would now find their way to Palestine, in spite of the declarations of spokesmen of His Majesty’s Government that Jewish immigration into Palestine is governed by other considerations thati the condition of the Jews in certain European countries, since he knows that it was during the first four years of the Nazi persecution of the Jews that the number of Jews entering Palestine was , at its highest, that the Zionists openly speak of Palestine as an outlet for Jews who are staivmg or persecuted in their own countries, and that there are many Jews in a estme who managed to enter in defiance of the elaborate organisation of e mandatory Power. But he might also conclude that the annexation of us na, an the opening of the Anglo-Italian negotiations, meant a heavy diplomatic defeat for His Majesty’s Government, and begin to wonder why he should elmg to the losing party when that party could not even give him satis- snme mmmnnl P ?- V' A 10 * 1 he was vitall &gt;' intel ’ested. It is conceivable that mmtb ^ twn nf fh from Ge ™ a P ma y have reached Ibn Saud during the first the Near Fast and ali'l!''' i, iv, 1 ' k now that German investigators were visiting to have comp Vn TprlH °t? ^ on ® w ^ 0 ’ according to private information, was to have come to Jedda, Herr van Beck, one of the earlv Nazis and a former a Saudi vS ftXfno Ylf C ° me ’ and P^ps never even applied for bS’-s'fXYgTpt 0 AtwIb at S a fo s weve not TOnve ? ed Ib ” Saud 5.

The facts which Ireported in my despatch No. 107 dated the 30th May suggest that Ibn Sand has ^abandoned the attitude of suspicion and dislike which he hitherto maintained •y^owards the Italian air mission. In bringing about the agreement with Italy *we have perhaps contributed towards this change of attitude, in diminishing Ibn Sand s fears of Italian penetration. Or it may be that he has begun to ask himself why he should pay more attention to hypothetical encroachment by Italy when Akaba and Maan, Jabal Nakhsh and Khor-al-Odeid, which he regards as his, are in British hands, from which they are unlikely to be detached without the use of force. But it is unlikely, it seems to me, that he will throw himself altogether into the arms of Italy. He is extremely cautious, and he will estimate Italian assurances, like M. Mussolini’s proclamation of himself as Protector of Islam, at their true value. Moreover, if the agreement is to be what His Majesty’s Government hope it will be, the Arab hopes hitherto encouraged by Italy must be disappointed. Nevertheless, we may expect Ibn Baud to be less cordial than he has been hitherto, and to counteract this tendency we have only one question of importance on which he could perhaps be given some satisfaction —the Hejaz Railway. The disinterested advice which he is receiving from His Majesty’s Government on various matters, mostly connected with Iraq, should continue to count in our favour, and to counteract to some extent the fears and suspicions which certain items of British policy in Arab affairs may have aroused. 6. One hesitates to make prophecies in matters so complicated, but I repeat two which I have ventured to make before. One is that no bribe would buy the support of Ibn Baud for the proposal to partition Palestine. The other is that, if a European war should break out, we should have reason to consider ourselves fortunate if Saudi Arabia remained neutral, since we have everything that Ibn Baud would like to have, while the countries likely to be opposed to us have nothin 0, that he covets. What he will do if the partition proposal is confirmed bv the present Royal Commission and adopted by His Majesty’s Government I do not know but 1 believe that he will move slowly and will hesitate to make a complete breach with His Majesty’s Government. But he may wink at the passage of armed men into Transjordan to assist the insurgents m Palestine, or even announce openly that he can no longer prevent it. Unfortunately he is out of our reach for nine months in the year, and the normal means by which a tendency to hostility could be counteracted to some extent frequent contact with e person responsible for foreign affairs and discussion of the general situation is closed to us It is fortunate that Ibn Baud follows the wireless reports closely, o i tv, n op of the B.B.C. have a high reputation for accuracy. 7 I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty's Ambassadors at Cairo and Bagdad, aid his Excellency the High Commissioner for Palestine and Transjordan. j &amp;c T?

Ibn Saud quoted extensively, e.cj., verse 82, chapter 5, which represents the Jews as the worst enemies and the Christians as the best friends of Islam, and said that the Arabs could not understand the alliance of Christian England with the Jews against the Moslems.” 5. From a secret memorandum by Ibn Saud, enclosed in Jedda despatch No. 16 dated the 25th January, 1938 :— “ They (i.e., His Majesty’s Government) are also aware that Palestine enjoys particular respect and importance in that it contains the first of the two qiblas and the third of those holy sanctuaries revered by millions of Moslems who regard it as a religious duty and an important command to combat and fight the Jews and to repel the danger of them from their sacred places and their sanctuary, as is clearly shown in verses of the Koran and traditions of the Prophet which are doubtless well known to the British Government.” Enclosure 2.

I look forward to receiving the copy of Bullard's despatch to which you refer In your letter and I bhall certainly read It with great Interest. j-,s I told you at the meeting of the Cabinet yesterday , I *111 certainly approach the proposals which you have made officially with every desire to meet them, though there are, as you are aware, certain objection which are not altogether without substance from the point of view of the Uovernment of India and of the Resident in the Persian Gulf to the actual suggestion which was originally made to me. The Rt.Hon. Viscount Halifax, KG., GC3I., OCXS., TD.You will have received a few days ago my letter of the 30th June in which I expressed my earnest hope that you would be able to accept the views contained in an official Foreign Office letter about the frontiers of Saudi Arabia, in order to keep Ibn Saud sweet. Since writing to you I have received and read a rather long despatch (No. 116 Secret of the 6th June) from Bullard who brings out in a very clear manner the possible dangers which may still lie ahead of us in connexion with Ibn Saud. I have given instructions for the despatch to be circulated to the Cabinet and so I do not trouble you with a separate copy. But Bullard makes out such a strong case that I have no hesitation in asking you to read with attention his despatch, which should reach30th June, 1938. My dear Lawrence, ' /) I have been considering the tiresome question of ceding to Ibn Saud certain territory in order to reach an agreed frontier between the Trucial Sheikhdoms and Saudi Arabia which was dealt with in India Office official letter P.Z. 2887/38 of the 3rd May. I have now authorised an official reply from my Department which will be reaching the India Office very shortly. The object of this private letter is to express the hope that you will yourself give as sympathetic consideration as possible to the suggestions which I have approved. My only reason for bothering you is that I do attach great importance to keeping Ibn Saud sweet for some years to come and I feel that what is now being suggested in the Foreign Office letter is both justifiable in itself and should go a long way towards enabling us to do so. I don’t want to bother the Cabinet with it if it The Most Honourable The Marquess of Zetland, G.C. S. I. , G.G.

Z. 8887/3 6 of 3rd May, respecting the possibility of ceding to Ibn Saud, in order thereby to secure an agreed frontier between the Trucial Sheikhdoms and Saudi Arabia, certain territory adjoining the Khor-el-Odeid which at present belongs to the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi# 2# Lord Halifax fully realizes that the grant to Ibn Baud of access to the KhOr-'el-Odeid could not be guaranteed to have a lasting good effect upon his relations with His Majesty^ Government. It is unhappily only too likely that the necessity placed upon His Majesty's Government of following a certain policy ih regard to Palestine may make it impossible for Ibn Saud not to work against them in certain circumstances, whether he receives satisfaction over his south-eastern frontiers or not. He has never made any attempt to conceal this possibility and the prospect of having it forced upon him has been one of the principal motives behind his constant appeals to His Majesty's Government to reconsider their policy. 3./ REM.

But although it cannot he guaranteed that any concession which might be made over the Khor-el-Odeid would have a permanent effect in securing Ibn Baud’s friendship, there are strong arguments, in Lord Halifax's opinion, for making every endeavour to reach a final settlement of this frontier question at the present time* His Lordship would in fact see great advantage in such a settlement even from the point of view of relations with Saudi Arabia* In His Lordship's opinion the position is different from what it was when Sir Reader Bullard expressed his doubts a year ago as to the advantages to be obtained from letting Ibn Baud have access to the Khor-el-Odeid, because His Majesty’s Government have since then, and at a time when the general international outlook has become increasingly threatening, adopted the policy of setting up a Jewish State in a part of Palestine- The change which this has brought into the Middle Eastern situation is fundamental and His Majesty’s Government must clearly do everything within their power at this present juncture to retain the good-will of Ibn Baud and - more important still - to strengthen his hand in dealing with his own people* A frontier settlement which would give him access to the sea at a new point on the Persian Gulf and ;w., ■ , could De represented as a success for his diplomacy would l.::::' help m feoth these directions. In any case the dangers of the present time are so great that no course of action which may promote these objects can safely be overlooked. 4 . It will be seen from what has been said above that in Lord Halifax’s opinion a concession regarding Ibn Baud's claim/claim to the Khor-el-Odeid might with advantage he made even at the riek of considerable inconvenience in other directions, as for example some diminution in the prestige of His Majesty's Government in the Persian Gulf, although he is naturally desirous that no avoidable action should he taken which might have this result* But for the reasons given below he is not convinced that the action which has been proposed for the settlement of the south-eastern frontiers of Saudi Arabia need in fact have a serious adverse effect on British prestige locally* 5. The position, as His Lordship sees it, is as follows* The Sheikh of Abu Dhabi controls a territory extending inland from the coast for an indefinite distance In theory this territory may be regarded as having in the recent past extended, or at any rate as having been capable of extension, as far west as the Blue line of the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1914 and as far south as the boundary, wherever that may be, dividing the territory of the Sultan of Muscat and Oman (whose territory has likewise been theoretically capable of extension to tho Blue line) from the territories of the Trucial Sheikhs. In practice, however, the Sheikh has been unable to assert his authority over so wide an area and His Majesty e Government have been obliged to recognise that utmost he has not asserted it further west or south than the so-called Riyadh line offered to Ibn Saud in 1935. , ,. Qhioivh has lost what may be called The Power to whom the SneiKn his/his reversionary rights to the area between the Blue line and the Riyadh line is unquestionably Ibn Baud, and he has lost them, not through any sudden act of conquest or intrusion, but as the result of a gradual forward movement which had probably begun long before the Blue line came into being* 6 , If it were possible to regard the Riyadh line as a natural frontier to the west and north of which the authority of the Sheikh was firmly established, there might be no need to apprehend a further Saudi advance* But it is nothing of the kind. Apart from the probability that Ibn Saud is already the over-lord of the inhabitants of the area lying between it and the Kh&lt;ijr-el- Odeid, the recent enquiries into the possibility of providing landing grounds in the hinterland of the Trucial coast for use by aircraft engaged on survey work do not suggest that the control of any of the Trucial Sheikhs over the interior is really effective, while it is known that Saudi officials have been -able in recent years to penetrate as far east as Baraimi* Sven, therefore if there is no imminent menace of Saudi or Wahabi expansion upon the Trucial coast itself, it equally does not appear that further expansion towards that coast would meet with any obstacle* 7 , It is, in fact, the nature of t^ is expansion which lies at the root of the problem. Ib.n Sau advance has proceeded quietly but inexo apparent/apparent reason except that there has been nothing to stop It. It i .• reasnnnM + - reasonable to suppose that for a ruler of Ibn Baud's nresti^ &lt; prestige it is easy to persuade desert tribes who are not under the control of any recognised ruler to say that they owe allegiance to himself, and unless some effective check to this natural and even inevitable process can be devised, it is likely to continue through the years until ibn Baud's authority extends to the very outskirts of the Trucial ports. There are only two ways, so far as Lord Halifax can see, of preventing this* The one is for His Majesty’s Government to lay down a frontier unilaterally and declare their intention of maintaining it by force of / ■ +~ (wx-U-i ftu. 1 iUjuj WvW to •(Iv* 044U%. arms. The other is to agree with Ibn Saud upon a frontier V '—— — — which he will formally and openly recognise, and which he and his successors will thereafter be unable to disregard without providing His Majesty's Government with grounds for opposing them with a degree of vigour which could not be justified in the present anomalous situations 8* There can be no question but that the second of these alternatives is much to be preferred, if it can be achieved* It cannot, however, be achieved without the cession to Ibn Saud of either the Jebel Naksh, which is impossible, or the Khor-el-Odeid, which is only possible ~~ - — ^ with the acquiescence of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi* The position of the Sheikh being whal it is, he would have every reason to welcome the establishment of a settled frontier, more or less following the Riyadh line, in return for/for the surrender of a small area of empty desert adjacent to the Khor-el-Odeid for which he can have little or no use, tut which may have great value for lln Saud, both sentimentally and as a possible corridor for an oil pipe—line to the Persian G-ulfN, 9. Whether the Sheikh can be persuaded to see •w .m- his own interests in this light is, however, a separate K : *.C: prohlerrip and on the assumption (which has yet to he Kki (r- (X 'Mvi ^ fO ^ proved) that he will refuse to do so, two main ways of compensating him still further for the loss of some of his territory have been considered*, The first of these is a money payment and the second is an assurance of supnort in the event of a serious attack from the landward sideo 10o Lord Halifax shares to the full the distaste which has been expressed for a money payment, because it clearly imports a questionable element into a settlement which can be justified on its own merits and which the ? Sheikh of Abu Dhabi ought to accept in his own interests c V- , *— ■ ' J in—* Nevertheless, if a money payment would secure the SheikhVs acquiescence in a frontier settlement, His Majesty’s Government ought not, in His Lordship’s opinion, to hesitate to pay any reasonable sum which might be necessary He notes that it is impossible for the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to hazard a guess as to the sum which the Sheikh would regard as adequate compensation, but looking at the question from another angle that is from the point of view of the value of a settlement to His Majesty's/ *1 i tl h r ' ’ ' -.

Majesty s Government - he considers that £25,000 ^ . &gt; a :Larger sum would a°t he too much. 11 ^ 1116 alternative, or additional, forai of or even compensation is an undertaking to protect the Sheikh in the event of a land attack from Saudi Arabia. Lord Halifax notes that in the opinion of the Political Resident the first question which the Sheikh would be likely to ask if approached regarding the Khor-el-Odeid would be: “Will His Majesty’s Government guarantee this “frontier as against Saudi Arabia?” His Lordship considers that if it were necessary to secure the Sheikh f s concurrence, an endeavour should be made to meet to some extent his wishes on this point. The precise wording ! of any assurance given to the Sheikh would need consider, ation. It would clearly be undesirable that His Majesty^ Government should undertake any responsibility for intervening if some tribal elements on the Abu Dhabi side of the frontier chose to repudiate the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi and to declare allegiance to Ibn Saud; nor could \ His Majesty’s Government accept responsibility for the prevention of tribal raids from Saudi Arabian territory across the frontier. The undertakings to be assumed by His Majesty’s Government should be so worded as to apply . ( , only in the event of major aggression against Abu Dhabi ' ' on the part of the territorial sovereign on the other side of the frontier. 12. Lord Halifax is aware that assurances of this kind may seem to constitute an extension of the responsibilities/ ^ /4v Adresponsibilities of His Majesty's Government. He realis that in particular strong objection is seen in many quarters to increasing the commitments of His Majesty’s es Government in the Persian Gulf by adding to the existing obligations to defend the Trucial Sheikhs from aggression by sea an obligation to defend any one of them from aggression by land, and that the view has been expressed that if His Majesty’s Government were to undertake such an additional commitment it might necessitate an adjustment in the forces of His Majesty's Government in the neighbourhood of the Gulf. His Lordship cannot help feeling, however, that these responsibilities already exist and the additional obligation would be more apparent than real® 13c In the first place, the fact that the air route along the Trucial coast is a vital sector in the communications of the Empire means that His Majesty's Government could not in practice allow any Power not under their influence to occupy any part of the coast or its immediate vicinity which was of importance for the air routeo The only uncertainty is at what point His Majesty's Government are to consider that their position on the Trucial coast would he threatenede At present they fine fr e^ so far as their formal obligations to the Sheikhs are concerned, to allow the predominant power in the adjacent parts of Arabia to extend its influence as far as the Trucia} ports themselveso It is doubtful, however, whether His Majesty's Government could even now remain inactive/inactive while the authority of one of the Truoial Sheikhs was irreparably undermined in this way, while in the event of a serious attack from Saudi Arabia His Majesty's Government wou;a in practice find themselves obliged to intervene to prevent the Sheikh from being overwhelmed, 14, In the second place, if any oil company hereafter wishes as the result of a survey to undertake active operations in the interior, it will not be able to do so unless it knows that the site of these operations lies to the north and east of a settled frontier, and once such operations had begun His Majesty Government would inevitably be obliged to interest themselves in the maintenance of that frontier, 15, Nevertheless, Lord Halifax is prepared to agree that every effort should be made to avoid the additional commitment involved in a definite guarantee of any landward frontier v/hich might eventually be fixed for the Sheikhdom of Abu Dhabi as the outcome of the present discussion and that the support of His Majesty r s Government should be limited to a promise to intervene energetically with Ibn Saud or his successors in the event of their disregarding the new frontier, 16, In the circumstances set forth above, Lord Halifax considers that His Majesty 1 s Government should endeavour to grasp an opportunity which may not recur of settling this most difficult of frontier questions and should to that end try to persuade the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi to part with the relatively small area necessary/bear upon any Trucial Sheikh to act to hi s own s own disadvantage, merely in order t o further the interests of His Majesty's Government, But in this case the action proposed is manifestly not to the Sheikh’s disadvantage. Moreover His Majesty’s Government are surely entitled to take into account the fact that without their protection not one of the Trucial Sheikhs could last for a day against Ihn Saud and to expect from these Sheikhs a greater degree of co-operation in matters affecting the interests of His Majesty’s Government than many of them have seemed disposed to show in recent years* 17* This being so, Lord Halifax feels that in the event of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi proving obdurate he should be informed that this is a case in which His Majesty’s Government must insist, in the interests of Qn his following their advice his people and successors, in return for which they will promise to take up behalf all matters a ffecting his landward frontiers and4 Ut the 6 laer&amp;tion. »f the Political Resident) a money payment, ifhieh might he disguised as compensation for the loss of imaginary dues or revenues from the ceded territory. 18 . The question of the effect which such an attitude might have upon the prestige of His Majesty’s U Lm ! /I s - HxJCrnMOkA f'U&amp;h tu* CUa.-(o, Government in the Persian Gulf is one upon which Lord Halifax naturally expresses an opinion with diffidence. But he suggests that provided no injustice is done a show of firmness in such a situation ought not to diminish the prestige of His Majesty's Government, but rather to enhance it. It may be argued that this might be so, but for the fact that to the Trucial Sheikhs it would appear that His Majesty's Government were being firm with one of themselves because they dared not be firm with Ibn Baud* Lord Halifax recognises the force of this argument, but he sees no reason why the advantages to the Sheikhs of a settled frontier should not be understood locally. It might indeed be represented to the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi that Ibn Saud is the friend of the British and has throughout his career (unlike certain lesser Arab rulers of no importance who are ignorant of world affairs) shown himself consistently well-disposed to His Majesty s Government and anxious In all circumstances to consult their interests; so that His Majesty's Government, for their part, have no hesitation in asking the Sheikh to contribute his share towards an agreement which is considered to he advantageous to all parties. 19./19. Kiere remains to be considered the opinion expressed by the Government of India that there are political objections to making a breach in the line of territory under British control at present stretching along the coast of the Persian Gulf from Qatar to Muscat or to admit further Saudi access to the Gulf. Kie Service Departments are understood to be satisfied that there are no strategical disadvantages to be apprehended fKm Saudi access to the Khor-el-Odeid, and it seems cloar that such access will net give Ibn Saud any greater opportunities for expanding his influence upon the Trucial Coast than he already possesses at the present time# On the contrary, a settled frontier between his territories and those of the Trucial Sheikhs would set definite limits to such expansion. Lord Halifax finds it difficult in these circumstances to form a clear idea of the nature of the political objections, and in any case these objections do not in his opinion outweigh the wider political advantages of securing a frontier settlement with Ibn Saud, 2®# Copies of this letter are being sent to the departments represented on the Middle Eastern Sub committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence and t® the Petroleum Department, I am.

Although, however, no frontier has been yet agreed ana Ibn Baud still claims territory east of the most easterly line so far suggested by H.M.G., nevertheless (as we understand) H.M.G. have requested Ibn Baud to restrain the Standard Oil Company of California from carrying out prospecting east of H.M.G. T s last proposed line, and have also requested the California Company itself in the same sense. You were kind enough to indicate to me on the map this line, which is H.M.G.’s latest offer and California’s interim prospecting frontier.

In 1934, when the said oil company was beginning its operations in Hasa, the Government of the United States of America asked His Majesty^ Government for information about the boundaries in those parts. His Majesty’s Government furnished the required information, and in particular, care was taken to explain for the information of the oil company, that the legal frontier of Saudi Arabia in that area v/as the 1? blue line. ' The fact that this communication had been made to the United States Government was duly conveyed to the Saudi Arabian Government in Sir Andrew Ryan’s letter Fo. 65 of April 28th 1934. Since that time His Majesty’s Government have not informed either the United States Government or the Saudi Arabian Government that they no longer regard the 'blue line' as the legal frontier or that they consider the/ Royal Highness . A-r-Pniro The Minister for Foreign Affair, Mecca.the oil company free to operate to +h^ . ^ perate to the east of that line. His Majesty's Government feel that they would have been justified in protesting to the Saudi Arabian Government when they learned that the oil company, m spite of the above-mentioned letter to the Saudi Government, were operating in the neighbourhood of Qasr al Salwa. On the contrary, out of deference to His Majesty King Abdul Aziz, and in their desire to do all they could to facilitate matters for him and for the company operating in his territory, they confined their action to informing representatives of the company, quite informally, that notwithstanding their previous communications to the United States and Saudi Arabian Governments, they would raise no objection to the company’s operating to the east of the line which His Majesty’s Government still regarded as the legal eastern frontier of Saudi Arabian territory, on the understanding that the company would not encroach on territory to the east of the extreme limit proposed by His Majesty’s Government to the Saudi Government. The action of His Majesty’s Government and of this Legation in conveying the information in question to representatives of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company was in accordance with the practice m cases where important oil companies, whether of the same or of different nationalities, are operating in onri Hi ^ Maiestv’s Government regret that adjoining areas, and his Majestythe Saudi Government should take exception to what is a normal procedure intended to ensure the maintenance of good relations between the great oil companies and also between the countries in which they are registered. ¥ith highest respects, (Signed) 1.

The Resident’s views are on P.Z.1344, and the Government of India’s on P.Z.160Q. A further telegram was sent to the Resident on the 18th March (P.Z.1577) and Sir Trenchard Rowle has now recorded his views on the supplementary questions then put to him. The answers are much what was expected. The Resident reports that there is no process of encroachment by the Saudis, the fear of which would induce the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi to cede the Khor as the price of a frontier settlement which would act as a carrier against Saudi encroachments. The only inducement possible is cash, and the Resident cannot estimate in advance what sum is the least that would attract the Sheikh. But he and the Government of India - who think that it is very doubtful that we would gain anything by offering I bn Baud tne Khor-al-Odeid - are averse from any suggestion that we should seek the Sheikh's agreement by the offer of financial compensation, which it is held, would have an unfortunate effect on our prestige not only in the Arabic Sheikhdoms but probably also in nei.,hbo • f woU ig be reoresented that H.M.G. had countries, since it would oe re^ ,, v,, c territory as a result of induced the Sheikh to sell his territo y „ s T hr Gaud.

The Minister adds his opinion that this offer would have a good chance of success. There might be no very serious difficulty about [2] even though Abu Dhabi claims Sufuk to be in his territory (1) remains the crux. In the fsce of what the Government of India and the Resident say we should have to offer Abu Dhabi cash payment if the Khor al Odeid is to be ceded, and H.M.G. would have to get over their dj.i fi cul t ies in finding funds for the purpose, while the procedure, successful or not, might well, as Sir T.Fowle thinks, have an unfortunate effect on our prestige among the Arab Sheikhdoms and their neighbours. And apart from that, the Government of India still think there is force in the objections to giving Ibn Saud access to the Trucial Coast.

Pz. im Department. 3 MAY B38 Sir, In connexion with, the recent correspondence on the subject of the S.a. boundaries of S*Arabia I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to forward, for the information of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, a copy of a note by Sir Trenchard Fowle containing his replies to the questions addressed to him in the Secretary of State’s tele .gram of the 18th March, No.561, (of which a copy was sent to you on the 22nd March under cover of India Office letter No.P.Z.1677/58) relative to the possible cession of the Khor al Odeid to Ibn Saud. In the light of this note, and of the views expressed in the Resident’s telegram of the 26th February, and in the Government of India's telegram of the 8 th March (copies of which were sent to you respectively on the 28th February and 9th March, under cover of India Office letter numbered P.Z.1544/3b ana 1600/38) the Marquess of Zetland is now able to express his considered opinion on the proposals which have been advanced for a settlement of the frontier separating Saudi Arabia from Qatar and the Trucial Sheikhs.2 laivvrttmrp nr ^ pn,,^ , Lill ^ 2. These proposals were put forward by; your Department early in February as an outcome of the desire of H.M.G. for the investigation of various proposals for securing the good will of King Ibn Saud. It was represented that one of the most important outstanding questions between H.M.G. and Saudi Arabia was that of the South Eastern Saudi frontier, and that the removal of this source of friction would be a valuable contribution to the promotion of good will between S.Arabia and H.M.G. in other matters. Agreement| on the definition of the frontier has hitherto been found impossible byreason of the insistence of the Saudi Government on their claim to three localities which, named in descending order of the importance apparently attached to them by Ibn Saud, are the Jebel Naksh, the Khor al Odeid and Sufuk. Since it is generally recognised that no compromise is possible in respect of the Jebel Naksh attention was devoted to the Khor al Odeid and to the possibility of reaching a satisfactory frontier settlement by the cession of this locality to Ibn Saud if the difficulties arising from the recognised rights of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi could be overcome.

Apart from the desirability of reacning a satisfactory settlement of the dispated frontier, Lord Zetland fully recognises tne importance of retaining and promoting Ibn Baud’s good will towards H.M.G. But he shares the Govt, of India’s doubt whether the offer of the Khor al Odeid, if it could be made, would be regarded by Ibn Baud as of sufficient value to affect materially the cordiality of H.M.G.’s relations with Ibn Baud, whereas, on the other hand, an attempt to overcome the formidable difficulties in the way of arranging the cession might well involve a grave risk 'of prejudicing British influence among the protected Rulers of | the Gulf. . It seems to him that nothing has happened in the past year to invalidate the view expressed by H.M. T s Minister at Jedda in his despatch No.47 of the 27th March 1937 wherein he said that even if it were possible to induce the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi to give up the Khor al Odeid to Ibn Saud he ’’doubted whether the transfer would be worth the making since it would not give Ibn Saud the port he needs and we should have made a political sacrifice without gaining the advantage which I think we should stand to gain from any improvement/^ *'*' v ^ *^^**~J *&gt;i 4. improvement in Ibn Saud s s economic position’'. 4. With regard to the feasibility of arranging the cession of the Khor al Odeid it is accepted that the cession could not be effected without the consent of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, whosd ownership has been ackno?/ledged by a series of decisions by Government culrmnatijig in the guarantee given to the Sheikh in 1906. Lord Zetland would be firmly opposed to any suggestion that pressure should be exerted on the Sheikh to secure his consent to the cession. In the Secretary of State’s vie?; the- Sheikh’s x consent raust-he—given veiunterirly, and whether it would be forthcoming must depend langeiy on the advantages which he would expect to derive therefrom. ‘ihe Political Resident has pointed out in his telegram of the 26th February that there is no imminent menace of Saudi or Wahabi expansion which the Sheikh would wish to arrest at the cost of surrendering part of his territory, and in his view it v/ould be necessary for H.M.G. to satisfy the Sheikh wi-ch monetary compensation if his consent is to be obtained. sir Trenchard Fowle finds it impossible to hazard any guess as to the amount of such compensation that the Sheikh/Draft Paper.

In his opinion it would have to he settled hy a process of bargaining, and he can only suggest, in the light of the Sheikh's dealings with Petroleum Concessions Limited, - that his figure te- likely to be high. But, even if /&gt;■ H.M.G. were prepared to make funds available for this purpose, any attempt to purchase the Sheikh’s consent is bound, in Lord Zetland’s view, to have very unfavourable reactions on British prestige among the Arab Sheikhs of the Gulf. to 5. There remains- ? -iRr-an-y event., the further difficulty that the Sheikh would expect any frontier settlement achieved in return for^territorial sacrifice on his part to be accompanied by an assurance that the irontier t/ould oe respected, and ha-'-would accordingly demand a guarantee of protection on the landward side of his territory. H.M.G. v/ould of course be able to promise the Sheikh diplomatic intervention in the event of violation of his territory, but it is not yet clear that he could oe promised the more practical assistance which he consider indispensable for the defence of his frontier. 5 Apart from the practical di_ faculties indicated above Lord Zetland feels that the/ 647 4 A Wt 22530fP 144 10,000 9.3&lt; IOP6 the suggested compromise is open to severeserious objections. In the Government of India's view the traditional objections to admitting Saudi influence to the Trucial Coast and to allowing the chain of protected States to be broken are still of considerable weight. The strategical importance of the air route along the Arab coast of the Gulf demand^ that there should be no weakening of British influence among the local Sheikhs. In Lord Zetland's view the cession of territory on the Trucial Coast to Ibn Saud - territory to which, it must be emphasised, he has no historical claim - would not fail to enhance his prestige, at the expense of that of H.M.G., among the Trucial Sheikhs, quite apart from the permanent opportunity it would give for the active extension of Saudi influence among them. Moreover, as the Resident and the Government of India have pointed out, even if the Sheikh's consent were refused ; the attempt to secure it, particularly if accompanied by some financial inducement, weia±d inevitaudry create the impression that H.M.G. a-T'Crcompelled through fear of ibn Saud to yield to his demands. Such an impression would be specially unfortunate at the present time when the Sheikhs are in a difficult mood and show signs of thinking that H.M.G.'s wishes ‘ can/ 1Wt 22530/P 144 10,000 9.37 TOP IP Draft Paper department. disregarded with impunity. While Lord Zetland regrets that it has so far proved i impossible to reach agreement with Ibn Saud on the question ot the frontier he sees no advantage, for the reasons given above, in attempting to reach a settlement at the expense of one of the Rulers under H.M.G.'s protection, and he trusts that the proposal will not be pressed. In His Lordship’s vie?/ the utmost to the claims of Ibn Saud, and he itJr- -&lt;;s^ntia±^ 64 ^, notwiiha laiidiiig the gnbaiTausment v^fei-ch may cause^ H.M.G, should continue to take their stand on the offer that has been repeatedly described as final. (Sgd.) R. PEE!I have been a good deal interested which have been passing about the proposed cession or sale of the Khor a1 Odeid to Ibn Saud, and I hope that if there is any question of bringing pressure to bear on the Sheikh you will give rise an opportunity of commenting. I am aware of the unhappy history of the Sheikh of Mohammerah and of its reaction on our good name in the Middle East; and I am very apprehensive myself of the possible effect on these small Sheikhlings of anything which they may interpret as a disposition on our part to truckle to Ibn Saud. ^nd in a case such as the present, given both the general consider ations involved and the long history of the area in issue, I should myself take a very strong objection to bringing pressure on the Sheikh to yield up, even on financial terms, any portion of his dominions; and I would judge, too, that the long range effect of any such action on oui pai t was likely to be unfortunate to a degree. I hope, therefore that despite Foreign Office pressure we shall oe able to stand firm, and I repeat I should like an opportunity for comment if there is any question of taking these proposals ^ seriously.e« c 2*1 * I 3 S' ^ t- ^ ^ r ■ c. t\rw''C, uh Mr. Glbsrm . ftkfc ^ »w 6 c . , X' VJ&gt; *' !

I do not think that there will he quite the same objections against using the arguments suggested as Mr against offering a monetary compensation,to the Sheikh •VXVKW J (of Abu Dhabi), fey an Arab would probably get the (erroneous) impression that in trying to persuade him to surrender part of his territory to Ibn Saud (1) we were frightened of the latter, and (2) we were trying to placate the latter at his, the Sheikh’s, expense. These impressions of the Sheikh would undoubtedly get about in Abu Dhabi and the rest of the Arab coast, and would, of course, do us no good. I have already reported (vide paragraph 9 of my Express Letter No.C-71' 3135 2 . of 16th Pehruary) that there are dl S q.uieting symptoms among the Truoial Coast Sheikhs and their people that they think the wishes of can he disregarded more or less with impunity, (c) paragraph 4 of the same telegram. The possibility of giving a guarantee of protection to the Sheikh would depend, it seems to me, on our ajcic/ft, power to implement the guarantee^ Our action depends on the views of the Service Departments, particularly the R.A.F. I think it extremely likely that in the event of a definite frontier being proposed as between Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia, the first question which the Sheikh would ask would be: 'Will H.M.G. guarantee it as against the Saudi Government?” (d) paragraph 5 of the same telegram. j there are objections to the line running through Sufuk Wells. i&amp;hirchj- “to the best of my recollection, is admitted by the Saudi Government to belong to Abu Dhabi.

In your telegram Ho.109 d ated December 9th,i937 I had the honour to receive your pemission to tell the Jedda manager of the California Standard Arabian oil Company informally of the present position in regard to the eastern frontier of Saudi Arabia. I saw Mr. Lenahan on December nth. and gave him the information in question. He expressed his thanks, and said that the Saudi Government had already explained about the territory in dispute and had told them not to enter it. He added that while his Company naturally wanted the question to be settled and would be the better pleased the more the territory covered by their concession, they were very anxious not to enter disputed territory and had given their representatives on the spot strict instructions to that end. He himself had wondered whether the prospecting party had perhaps entered the disputed area by mistake and caused the British Government to protest, since about six weeks earlier the Governor of Hasa had suddenly recalled the prospecting party to B&amp;naiyan. I said that the recall of the prospecting party could not be connected with the recent communication of His Majesty’s Government to the Saudi Government, which had only just been made. 2» As I had spoken to Mr. Lenahan for his confidential information I was rather surprised when, a few days later, Fuad Bey referred to the matter, having heard of it from Mr. Lenahan. Fuad Bey said that the King was hurt because our action suggested that we did not trust him to do what was right. I The Right Honourable Anthony Eden, M.C.&gt; M.P.&gt; &amp;c., &amp;c. ■ &amp;c.142 I said that there was no question of distrust. Nor did His Majesty’s Government arrogate to themselves the right, as Fuad Bey seemed to think they did, to give instructions to a foreign company operating in Saudi territory,, All over the world there was commercial competition between British and American oil companies, and it was natural that information should he given them in such cases as that of the qatar i rentier, Puad Bey said that the Saudi Government considered that the frontier question was between Governments, They could not object to our keeping in touch with the United States Government on the matter, if we wished to do so, but they did object to our speaking to the company and thereby, as they considered, interfering in a matter which lay between them and the Company, and they would make a protest in writing, 3. By way of showing the friendly attitude of the Saudi Government Puad Bey said that the prospecting party had entered the disputed zone but were given orders to withdraw on receipt of my note of December. 4th 0 This is at variance with what Mr, Lenahan said, and I am inclined to disbelieve it. 4. Enclosed is a translation of a written protest dated January 10th but received on January 17th. I am telling Fuad Bey that the letter is being forwarded to His Majesty's Government and pointing out that there is no question of our having discussed the frontier question with the Company, who were merely kept informed of the situation. 5 . M r. Lenahan professed great regret at having raised thl . i» s », w ..ntlonta th, matter to B.y, ^ .meed Mmeelf od the ground that he had no. understood that I »» . + -iniiv Mr. Lenahan is not intelligent speaking to him confidentially.

Aornr^ * According to Mr. Lenahan, Fuad Bey seemed personally annoyed to learn that co^unications had passed behind his back, and this agrees with what one knows of Fuad Bey. 0 n the other hand the suggestion that our communicating with the Company might be interpreted as indicating distrust of the Saudi Government might well have come from the King. 6 . I can only suggest that a written reply should be sent to the Saudi Government repeating more or less what I have said orally. The reply might say that the communication between His Majesty's Government and the California Standard Arabian Oil Company was not based on any distrust of the Saudi Arabian Government but was in accordance with the practice where important oil companies, whether of the same or different nationalities, are operating in adjoining areas; and that His Majesty’s Government have had no discussions with the Company, but have merely conveyed information to them, and therefore regret that the Saudi Arabian Government should take exception to what is a normal procedure intended to ensure the maintenance of good relations between the great oil companies and the countries in which they are registered.

Sir, I have had under consideration your despatch Ho. 10 (139/546/13) of 23rd January in regard to the activities of the California Standard Arabian Oil Company in the neighbourhood of the Qatar frontier. 2. You will recall from Sir John Simon's despatch No.112 of 19th March 1934, that early in that year the United States Embassy in Angora made informal enquiries of His Majesty's Embassy regarding the treaty instruments governing the frontiers separating the former Ottoman Dominions and the territories to the east and south thereof. Some three months later the United States Embassy in London made similar enquiry of my department in connexion with the aircraft which the California Standard Arabian Oil Company were then proposing to use for survey work over the area of their concession in Eastern Saudi-Arabia, and it was discovered that the enquiries in Angora had in fact been made in connexion with this oil company's concession. (See Foreign Office despatch to Jedda No. 166 of 25th April 1934). Care was taken to explain to the United States Embassy in London, for the information of the oil company, that the legal frontier of Saudi Arabia in this area was the 'blue line' and the Saudi Arabian Government were subsequently informed that His Majesty's Gove mment Sir Reader Bullard, K.G.M.G-. , C.I.E., etc., etc., etc., jedda.4 Government had made this communication to tn luuumcation. to the United states . GOVernment ( Je&lt; 3-da despatch Ho.130 of 28th April 1934 ). 3# Since those communicati ons His Majesty’s Government have not informed either the United States Government or the Saudi Arabian Government that they no longer regard the 'Blue 'line' as the legal frontier or that the oil conpany is fre e to operate to the east of that line. His Majesty’s Government would, I feel, have been Justified in protesting to the Saudi Arabian Government when they learnt that the concessionary oil company, in spite of their original communication to the Saudi Arabian Governments were operating in the neighbourhood of Qasr-es-Salwa, On the contrary, out of deference to King Abdul Aziz, and in their desire to do all they could to facilitate matters for him and for the company operating in his territory. His Majesty f s Government refrained from making any complaints either to the United States Government or to the Saudi Arabian Government and they confined their action to informing the interested representatives of the oil company quite informally, that notwithstanding their previous communications to the United States and Saudi Arabian Governments,they would raise no objection to the company operating to the east of what His Majesty 1 s Government still regarded as the legal eastern frontier of Saudi Arabian territory. The only condition made was that the company should refrain from encroaching beyona the maximum line which His Majesty’s Government had offered to King Abdul Aziz. 4 .

I found that Sheikh Hafiz had not clearly realised the position about the concession and I explained to him, with the aid of a map produced by Mr. Zada, that the concession was tor a limited area which was described on a map attached to the concession, and that although, in one place, it extended slightly beyond the maximum frontier claimed by King Abdul Aziz, it did not, in fact, extend to what we regarded as the frontier between Qatar and Saudi Arabia. The limit of the concession in fact lay well to the north of the maximum line which wm had been able to offer to King Abdul Aziz. There was no question of an unlimited ‘ blanket concession,’ as in the case of the Saudi concession to the Standard Oil Company of California, and in view of our known views on the frontier question there could be no question of the concession extending over territory the sovereignty over which was in any real doubt. “ Sheikh Hafiz did not dissent from this explanation and did not pursue the matter further.” I have, &amp;c.

My Government have considered that opinion with the attention which they pay to every proposal made to them by the Saudi Aiabian Government, but they do not find it possible to agree that the proposed mission would be pointless, 'since they believe that the claim of the Saudi Arabian Government is based in part upon incorrect topographical data. The sole object of the mission would be to establish certain facts, and my Government trust that the Saudi Arabian Government will find it possible to agree to its despatch. With highest respects, R.

AS a result of your conversation with me last Sunday evening, the 30th January, regarding the correspondence going on about the abstention of the employees of the companies operating, whether in Saudi Arabia or in the Arab amirates, on the Persian Gulf from penetrating beyond the frontier to which my Government adhere, I looked up the correspondence exchanged between Mr. Calvert and my colleague, Yusuf Yasin, of the 26th September, 1935 and the 17th Jumadi-al-Thani (? Rajab), 1354, thinking that I might perhaps find in it what you mentioned to me in your conversation that evening concerniim what your Government meant.

As regards the legal rights to which you refer and to which the British Government pretend, our Government cannot recognise and accept them and cannot consider them as basis for any discussion in connexion with those frontiers. In respect of the above, our Government therefore preserve their fullest rights in the territories and places which they cannot agree to renounce in favour of the Amirs of those territories, and (in regard to) all privileges or rights which may be granted at those reserved places, our Government cannot recognise or agree to them, and record their reservation in their regard. “ This is on the one hand, and on the other I am pleased to inform you that our Government are fully prepared at any time to discuss the settle ment of the question of the frontiers in a spirit of affection and friendship to those neighbouring Amirs whenever discussion may be resumed on this subject.” (The English of this passage is taken from the translation which was sent to the Foreign Office in Jedda printed letter No. 292 of the 16th October, 1935.)( 2 ) This letter was apparently effective in inducing the British Government to issue instructions to Mr. Calvert to address to fcheikh Y usuf Y asin another letter, dated the 26th October, in which he stated that Sir Andrew Kyan, who, as your Excellency is aware, is shortly arriving in Riyadh, will bring with him new proposals in regard to the frontier question. His Majesty s Government hope that these proposals will lead to a settlement. Sir Andrew Rvan did in fact bring new proposals which modified the previous ones. This shows that the position of the British Government as indicated by Mr. Calvert in his first letter of the 26th September, 1935, was not final, as I understood from you in your conversation. , . , ,, The oosition of my Government regarding the frontier to which they adheie is explained in the note sent by His Highness the Amir Faisal to your Excellency on the 16th Shawwal 1356 (the 19th December, 1937).

Enclosure 3. Su R. Bullard to Fuad Bey Hamza, My dear Fuad Bey, Jedda. February 9, 1938. IN replying to your letter of the 5th February I think it more^ useful to confine myself to the meaning of the letter of Mr. Calvert of the 26th September, 1935, as I tried to do in our conversation of the 30th January. I am sorry if the Saudi Arabian Government read the paragraph which you quote in a different sense from the sense in which it was intended by His Majesty s Government. I notice that you quote the Arabic translation which was sent with Mr. Calvert s letter. You are aware, however, that the official text of our communications to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs is the English, which is signed by the head of the post: the Arabic translation is sent for the convenience of the Ministry. The paragraph to which you refer reads thus :— “ The southern limit of the oil concession granted to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company by the Sheikh of Qatar does not extend beyond this c Green Line,’ but lies to a considerable distance to the north of it. The concession does not, therefore, extend to any territory under discussion with the Saudi Government.” (In the Arabic translation which accompanied this letter this passage was inserted in English.) This paragraph is composed of two sentences. The second is merely a corollary of the first, and was based on repeated assertions by His Majesty’s Government that they were not prepared to discuss any further abatement of their claims beyond the Green Line. It is true that His Majesty’s Government subsequently found themselves able to propose the line which was put forward by Sir Andrew Ryan at Riyadh, but that is beside the point for the moment. My point is that the paragraph quoted above expressed the position as it was on the 2bth September, 1935, from the point of view of His Majesty’s Government. I hope that this paragraph is now quite clear. Yours sincerely, R. W. BULLARD.' l ^IS DOCUMEN T IS THE PEOPERTY OF HIS RR ,„ tannic MAJESTY’S GOVERNMEET EASTERN (Arabia). CONFIDENTIAL.

R. W. BULLARD. Enclosure. Minister for Foreign Affairs to His Majesty’s Minister. (Translation.) (After compliments.) Mecca, Shawwal 16, 1356 (December 19, 1937). I HAVE the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 195 of the 4th December (1st Shawwal 1356) regarding the question of the frontiers between the Saudi Arabian Kingdom and the Arab amirates on the Persian Gulf, and the proposal of the British Government based on information which has reached them to the effect that the geologists of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company have begun prospecting in the neighbourhood of Qasr Salwa. You have been so good as to refer to the views of the British Government as to the frontier line in that region, and to their readiness to reopen negotiations with a view to reaching a settlement on the basis which they have already explained to the Government of His Majesty the King, subject to the proviso that they trust that, pending a final settlement, the employees of C.A.S.O.C. will not go beyond the frontier indicated by the British Government. The British Government have, moreover, suggested that a joint topographical mission should be formed to ascertain the position of some of the natural features of the places situated near that line. The Government of His Majesty the King welcome the idea of opening negotiations with a view to arriving at a settlement of the frontier line in that region. They have always been ready to show their good intentions and disposed to^come to an agreement and an understanding. I am compelled, however, to observe to your Excellency that the failure to arrive at an agreement in the past was not due to any lack of desire on the part of the Government of His Majesty to settle the question. The difficulty arose from their inability to agree to the renunciation of their established rights in the territories included in the definition of the frontier, which they put forward through Sir Andrew Ryan, and which represented the moderate and reasonable minimum for their frontiers. Whenever an opportunity presented itself my Government have explained the essential reasons which compelled them to adhere to the frontier which they had explained in the note which was communicated to Sir Andrew Ryan by the Deputy Minister2 H for Foreign Affairs on 29/12/1353 (3rd April, 1935) As, however the British Government, in spite of the evidence and arguments cornniiinicated to them on other occasions, the last of them being the visit of Mr Rendel last spring and the recent conversation between you and the Deputy Minister lor oreign Affairs, still adhere to the frontier mentioned in your above-mentioned note, the Government of His Majesty consider the possibility of arriving at a final settlement very difficult so long as the British Government hold to their position and do not agree to the actual situation of what is in reality in the possession and under the influence of His Majesty the King. If, however, the British Govern ment are prepared to open the subject and to seek a solution on the basis of the actual facts—a solution which would obviate the difficulty—nothing would be more agreeable to the Government of His Majesty. As to the employees of C.A.S.O.C. not going beyond the places still in dispute, His Majesty’s Government had already explained to the company’s representa tive the actual situation as arrived at with your Government, and' had informed him of the points still in dispute, and they do not believe that the company’s employees will go beyond what my Government believe to be within their territories, just as they believe that the responsible authorities in the Arab run i rates on the Persian Gulf, for their part, will not allow the representatives or employees of the companies operating in their territories to cross the line laid down in the note to Sir Andrew Ryan, until a final agreement has been concluded between the parties concerned. As to the despatch of a topographical mission to fix the position of certain natural features in the areas in dispute, my Government do not know how those difficulties can be overcome which were explained by the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs in the conversation which he had with you on Friday, the 10th December (7th Shawwal 1356), and would prefer to learn the opinion of the British Government, whether they do not share the point of view of the Saudi Government that it would be advisable to come to a final settlement of the frontier whether by specifying places or by specifying lines of latitude and longitude, before proceeding to make a survey. ^ I therefore beg you to be so good as to explain the point of view of my Government on the subject to the British Government and to acquaint me with their views upon it.

Sir, IN my despatch No 187 dated tho 98th n edda, January 11, 1938. IMliiliSsissl Th ^ - ^ i 1Slan ^ S1( ^ e ’ anc ^ tllat I was trying to clear up this point The wording seemed to me neither logical nor in accordance with what Fuad Bev dated the nttf A” ™ /f ssur “ ce whlch ] 1 reported to you in my telegram No. 92 not December. 1 suggested to Fuad that if in the'phrase “ They do believe that the company s employees will go beyond what my Government believe to be within their territories ” the words italicised could be replaced by a lefeience to the frontier as defined in the proposals of His Majesty’s Government the note would express what I understood to be the Saudi Government’s point of vmw. Fuad Bey, however, sent me a letter dated the 25th December (translation enclosed) containing the proposal for mutual abstention from operations in the disputed area which I conveyed to you in mv telegram No. 103 of the oOth December. F ° r SOme time 1 il0 P ed to induce Fuad Bey to withdraw his letter of the 25th December and to return to the note of the 19th December, with the amend ment which I had proposed. It would have been better for the Saudi Arabian Government to say C£ We do not think our prospectors will go east of your line and we assume that your prospectors will not come west of ours,” rather than to make the one dependent upon the other, as they have done in the letter now trans mitted to you. I have, however, been unable to secure the withdrawal of the note of the 25th December, with its proposal that mutual abstention on the Saudi side should be dependent upon abstention on our side. Fuad Bey’s behaviour has been peculiar about this point. He admits that he gave me the oral assurance reported in my telegram No. 92 dated the 11th December. From one or two indirect remarks he has made I can only conclude that Ibn Saud and Yusuf Yasin con cocted the one-sided statement to which I objected, and that he could not induce the King to give in writing an unconditional assurance such as he had himself given me orally. However this may be, the letter of the 25th December remains the last word in writing and I send it to complete the record, though I shall quote, if need arises, the oral assurance given by Fuad on the 11th December. From what Fuad has said on more than one occasion, and from statements made by the Jedda manager of the California-Arabian Standard Oil Company, I do not fear that there will be any prospecting in the disputed area by the C.A.S.O.C. at present. 3. I am sending copies of this despatch and enclosure to the Hon. the Political Eesident in the Persian Gulf at Bushire, and to the Secretary to the Government of India, New Delhi. I have, &amp;c. B. W.

I HAVE referred to the text of the second paragraph of the note sent to you on the 19th December, 1937, concerning the south-eastern frontiers, and I now explain the object (of that note) to you. The position of my Government is clear in her adhering to and insisting on their established right over the whole of the territory bounded by the frontier defined in the note communicated to Sir Andrew Ryan on 29.12.1353 (3rd April, 1935), and consider that there is nothing to prevent them from allowing the representatives of the O.A.S.O.C. from making a geological or topographical survey within that frontier, especially if the news we have received is taken into consideration, that the representatives of the companies which are operating in the amirates on the Persian Gulf have violated that frontier. If, however, those Governments agree to refrain from violating the frontier until a final agreement has been arrived at as to the places in dispute, my Government will be prepared to inform the representatives of the company of the necessity not to violate frontier described by the British Government as the green line, either for drilling or for prospecting operations.

Fuad that he should give me his personal opinion as to the sort of solution whicn he thought might be acceptable to his Government and I would uiiink it over and give my personal views on possibil ty of its acceptance by His Majesty’s Government. In this way neither Government would be committed. Fuad took several days for reflection during which he probably sounded the King. After much talk during which I had to steer him away from expressing a definite preference for Jabal Nakhsh he put this forward as a solution which might have some hope of acceptance by Ibn Saud: (1) His Majesty's Government to offer to absndon to Ibn Saud whichever of the two areas Jabal Nakhsh and Ehor al~0daid they [grp. omtd.Jed the less important; (2) Frontier to run through Sufuk [? wells] which should be free of access to the population on both sides. 5. I gave no hint that I thought a compromise possible and my reply to Fuad is to be personal. This is to save the King's face in case of rejection. But I earnestly hope it wall be possible to compromise and to remove the only major difficulty other than protection that is still outstanding. I will not repeat all Fuad’s appeals as I know His Majesty s Government are anxious to do anything they can within reason at present moment _ but will only remind you that this is a point on which Ion Saud is terribly sensitive and that I believe offer of this compromise would have a good chance of success.

The enquiry was whether in the Chairman's personal opinion it would be possible, so far as the Company’s own interests were concerned, for the Company to reach an agreement with the American company which holds the concession for eastern Saudi Arabia, whereby the two companies would dispose of the profits, if any, from the exploitation of the Jebel Nakhsh area in such a manner as to render possible, merely so far as concerned the Company's own interests, a change in the Qatar frontier* The answer now received is that no such arrangement is possible.

Fowle to expect the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi to surrender his rights without some more concrete compensation than the Middle East Committee was able to consider. It seems to be doubtful whether we should get from Ibn Saud even a definite treaty settlement of the frontier - not to mention a return to his 1915 engagement not to interfere with the Trucial Sheikhdoms. The natural course would be to offer the Sheikh pecuniary compensation, and I should think that this is the only chance (and possibly a small one) of getting him to agree. Stress was laid in the Committee on the difficulty of H.M.G. finding funds for this purpose, but we should, I think, none the less leave this form of compensation open for consideration.

' It is desired however to examine the possibility of making some further concession to Ibn Saud f s claims' which might conduce to an agreement upon the frontier question.^ A preliminary discussion has accordingly taken place among the Departments concerned.' It is of course realised that this same question was gone into carefully a year ago, and that no ^ s' r ^ ^ further concession to the Saudi claims,' apart from the modification of the frontier near Sufulc, was then found possible.' But the question was then examined mainly as a part of the frontier problem/ (I Draft Paper. 7 &lt;1 % Department, / 2 . x problem and not against the background of wider issues of policy to which ^ S' ^ s' H.M.G* now attach special importance,^ 3. Of the^two Saudi claims it is recognised that there is no prospect of making any concession in respect of the Jebel Naksh, which is physically part of s' / ^s* the Jebel Dukhan and therefore of Qatar, and which is covered by the oil concession granted with the approval of ^ ^ ^ x^ H.M.G, to Petroleum Concessions Ltd. x r 4*, There remains the Khor al Odeid, and the^uestion has been raised whether the obstacles which have hitherto been held to prevent any concession to Ibn Saud in respect of this territory can by any means be ^overcome.

As regards the possibility of offering monetary compensation H.M.G. would probably experience very great, if not insuperable, difficulty in making funds available for ^ ^ ^ —- the purpose. It has been suggested however that it might be possible to demonstrate to the Sheikh that it is in his ov/n interests that there should be a settled frontier between his territory and Saudi Arabia, that H.M.G-. have so far failed to reach agreement with Ibn Saud owing partly to the latter’s insistence on his claim to the Khor al Odeid, and that the cession of this territory, which -'Is presumably of no material value to Abu Dhabi, would-be a price well worth paying for an agreed frontier.

EAST ERN AND SOUTH EASTERN BOUNDARIES OF SAUDI- ARABIA . ~ THE SUB—COMMITTEE had under consideration the following papers Paper No. M.E.(O) 250 - prepared in the Foreign Office. Paper No. M.E.(O) 251 - note prepared in the India Office. MR. RENDEL said that he had little to aad to the Foreign Office memorandum on the possible cession of the/ L &gt; A Khor-el-Odeid to I'bn Saudo The Foreign Office fully realised all the difficulties and objections in the way of this suggestion*. Indeed, the Bub-Comuiittee would remember that the whole question had been fully gone into about a year ago at a time when His Majesty 5 s Government had, for political reasons, been most anxious to make any possible concession to Ibn Baud in this area. The Sub-Committee had then agreed that he (Mm Rendel) should take up the question during his impending visit to the Persian G-ulf, and he had in fact discussed it very fully with the Political Resident, who had produced arguments which had reluctantly convinced him at the time that nothing more conic, be donee He had accordingly, when he visited Jedda, argued the case strongly with the Saudi authorities and used all the arguments with which the Sub-Committee were already familiar against such a concession, but without success** In his view, Ibn Saud might well have accepted the Riyadh line if it had been put forward in April, 1935. Our offer had, however, been made too late, and since then it had become even more difficult owing to the Palestine question, to reach agreement with Ion Saud about the frontier* It appeared impossible to make any concession as regards the Jebel hakhsh, out if the Khor-el-Odeid could be conceded, it seemed just possible that a settlement of the frontier question might still be reached*. The present position was that, in view of the international situation, it had become far more important3- us than before wo retain Ibn Sand's friendship 0 But* ^ as a result of our policy in Palestine, our relations with the Middle Eastern countries and with Ibn Sand had greatly deteriorated. It had been said that Ibn Sand would not actively turn against us unless there were a European war. But events in Palestine had made it much more difficult to rely on his friendship, even in time of peace, and the possibility of his turning against us in the event of a catastrophe was now a serious one and could not be ignored, ihe Cabinet were most anxious to do anything possible to forestall or reduce this danger, and it was in view of their conclusion of 22nd December that the Foreign Office had revived the question of the Khor-el-Odeid, in the hope that, if the couth--Eastern frontier could be settled by this means, a positive contrioution might be made towards securing Ibn baud s goodwill. Even though this concession might not oe an important one in comparison with the major issue of Palestine * it might still go some way to tip the scale should matters be otherwise evenly balanced. The Foreign Office felt that the case for holding out against Ibn baud over the Khor-el-Odeid was a questionable one. The place could be of little use to the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi from whose main settlements it was remote, and there seemed little evidence to show that the Sheikh exercised any real authority over it, Geographically its retention by Abu Dhabi as against Saudi Arabia seemed anomalous. On the other hand, we were obvisouly bound by the assurances we had given the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi in 1906, and clearly could make no concession except with his agreement.It had been argued in the past that the retention of the Khor-el-Odeid hy Abu Dhabi was necessary in order to maintain unbroken the chain of British protected States extending from Qatar to Muscat, so that the land route along this coast should nowhere pass through foreign territory« He wondered, however, whether this argument was a really sound one, and whether this necessity had not been t aken a little too much for granted. While then it seemed doubtful whether the case for the retention of the Khor-el-Odeid by the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi was really as strong as we had sometimes thoughts we might be giving Ibn Saud a very real advantage if we allowed him to acquire this new outlet to the sea. If oil should be found in Eastern Saudi Arabia the possession of this piece of coast would enable bhe oil companies to ship oil direct (if necessary oy means ox a pipe line to the outer reefs) without having to navigate the difficult waters of the Gulf of Bahrein. Mr. Rendel felt that it would be a great mistake to oppose this merely for the sake of trying to get more transit dues for Bahrein, which was in any case now obtaining ample revenue from its own oil. On the whole, then, ne ielt onao, Ij- i ^ were possible to give up the Khor-el-Odeid, we might be giving Ibn Saud a real advantage, which might go a long way oo enable us to settle the frontier question, ana thus to retain his goodwill in an emergency, while we should not be depriving either ourselves or the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi of anything of any real value... MR. GIBSON said the India Office were as anxious as the Foreign Office to do anything possible to retain ion Sana's friendship. They thought, however, that the first question for examination was the difficulty - 4 --5- of obtaining a transfer of this territory from the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, He could not agree with Mr, Rendel f s statement that as Abu Dhabi did not exercise sovereignty over the Khor-el-Odeid to the extent of actual occupation, that territory should be handed over to another Power. Such action would be contrary to Sir Percy Cox’s assurance of 1st December, 1906, that the Khor-el-Odeid was Abu Dhabi territory, and His Majesty’s Government would be prepared to prevent its occupation by anybody else. On the analogy of Mr. Rendel’s remarks it might be said that we should hand over a portion of Australia to Japan e MR. RK1TDBL said the Khor-el-Odeid area was a barren waste where no Power had exercised teriitorial sovereignty. The Sheikh of Abu Dhabi had made no effort to colonize the Khor-el-Odeid. MR. GIBSON pointed out that in 1906 we had prevented Abu Dhabi from occupying the area. THE CHAIRMAN said it was essential to be quite clear as to our motives in regard to making a cession of territory to Ibn Saud. He aid not accept any view underlying the suggestion that our policy in Palestine had wronged the Arabs. The Arabs had done very well out of the Great War, thanks to the success of British Arms. But even if it were held that there was a wrong to be righted, he failed to see how this would be effected by taxing territory frcm one Arab, who happened to be weak, and giving it to another who happened to be strong.1 W,. iiSNDSL did not consider that it was a question of rights or wrongs done to the Arabs, Whatever views might he held about Palestine - on which point he felt that the less said about right and wrong the better - what we were dealing with now was the purely practical question of safeguarding British Imperial interests for the future. One of the results of our policy in Palestine had been to create a real and definite danger that, in the event of a European war, Arabia might ally itself with our enemies 0 The situation was closely parallel to that which had exist ed in the cases of Turkey and Bulgaria at the time of the G-reat War. The opinion was widely held that, if the danger of those countries aligning themselves with our enemies had been adequately considered and suitable measures to prevent it taken in time, the consequent disasters could have been averted, with results the importance of which it was unnecessary to emphasise. We were now considering whether anything could be done to forestall a possible similar eventuality m the case of Ibn Baud, There was no question of taking a territory from a weak ruler and giving it to a strong one; it was simply a case of trying to bring about by agreement a frontier settlement which would go a long way to ensure the maintenance of peace and the avoidance of dangerous friction in future and thus be to the advantage of all concerned^ In so far as the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi was concerned, he pointed out that none of the minor Arab rulers on the Arab side of the Persian Gulf could exist without British protection. They would all have lost their independence to Ibn Saud or to some other powerful State many years ago had it not been for this. But surely we could give this protection on our own terms. In the absence of a frontier settlement, it might be extremely difficult for the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi to maintain his rights, not only to the Khor-el-Odeid, but te, the important areas of the hinterland in which there wasnow a possibility of oil npinn- -p 1 oemg founa= it would therefore be to the Sheikh of A b u Dhabi's own advantage to reach an ea.ly frontier settlement and the loss of the Khor-el-Odeid might © a very light price to pay for ito 1®. GIBSON considered that if iir. .endel's argument was to hold it would be necessary to ensure an agreement with lb* Sana foi a definite frontier which would effectively prevent Saudi expansion over the Sheikh's territories. the MK. hSIIDSL agreed ana said he could not contemplate that Khoi-el-Odeid should be hanaed over to Ibn Saud in the absence of a frontier settlement which he Ibn Saud had been made fully aware of our to the Khor-el-Odeid and Abu Dhabi 0 His could not transfer this territory and all had agreed to respect* attitude in regard Majesty’s Government that they could ao would be to facilitate an agreement by which the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi would consent to hand over the Khor— el-Gdeid to Ibn Saud m return for a general settlement arranged between those two Powers. He pointed out that Petroleum Concessions Limited had been given a prospecting licence by the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi and it was essential to define the frontiers before their arrangements had gone much further. Mil. GIBSON asked whether it was likely that Ibn Saud would become reconciled to a frontier agreement if he were given Khor-el-Odeid. MR. RENDER said that it was impossible to answer this question. Our information showed that Ibn Saud attached iU ore importance to the Jebel Nakhsh than to the Khor-el-Odeid, but as it seemed quite impossible to do anything to meet him over the Jebel Nakhsh - where in any case his claim seemed weaker - the only alternative seemed to be to consider the possible cession of the Khor-el-Odeid. In answer to a question Mr. Rendel said that he thought that Ibn Baud’s belated in sistence on the Jebel Nakhsh was due to a belief that oil existed there. On the other hand, the Khor-el-Odeid would obviously be of considerable value to him, if the Standard Oil Company of Californiab concession proved a success.CAPTAIN PHILLIPS said he was surprised to see in the memoranda that strategic objections to handing over the Khor-el-Odeid to Ibn Saud had been put forward so strongly. When the nuestion was considered a year ago ? it was stated by the Admiralty representative that strategically 3 there were no serious objections to handing over the Khor-el-Odeid. It really amounted to the fact that Ibn Sand had already one access to the sea and he was to be given another. The Admiralty view was 3 therefore^ that the strategic objections to the possible cession of the Khor-el-Odeid to Ibn Saud should be ruled out. The Admiralty were not concerned with the political aspe.ts of the problem 3 but as a member of the Sub-Goimnitteehe felt that if 3 by the cession of the Khor-el-Odeid, a settlement with Ibn Saud would be obtainable^ it should be carried out. He wondered^ however 3 whether the bait was big enough 3 and whether the result would not be that we should annoy Abu Dhabi and get nothing from Ibn Saud in return. LIEUTEKANT C0L0N3L 0S30HNP said the War Office had never subscribed to the view regarding the strategical mportance of an unbroken line of British-controlled tates along the Persian Gulf. Nor had they agreed ith the policy followed by the Sub-Committee in regard o relations with Ibn Saud. The War Office were only ndirectly concerned with the question at issue? but? n view of the fact that the principal burden of-9 maintaining order in future would fall on them, m the event of further disorders in Palestine, and also because, for several years, British prestige in the Middle East had obviously been deteriorating, they considered that they should be allowed to express their views more strongly than they had done in the past. They were of opinion that very early steps should oe taxer to liquidate the oustending question of the baudi frontiers and strongly supported the Foreign Office proposal. They felt that the time had come for the problem to be lifted from the level of the local interests, on which it had been considered hitherto, and regarded from the point of view of British Imperial policy as a whole, when the figures of Ion Baud and Abu Dhabi would be seen in their true prospective* The War Office had never yet been convinced that there were any insurmountable obstacles, except possibly the Jebel Nalcsh, to prevent us permitting Ibn Baud to occupy all the area he claimed. Ibn baud had demonstrated his friendship for the British both publically and privately, even during the last two years, when the Arabs had been definitely hostile. The War Office had an uneasy feeling that the discussions in the Committee over the past four years, in which we had gradual],y yielded point after point to Ibn baud, had been a ’dog in the manger’ policy not worthy of the British Empire* They, therefore, supported the Foreign Office in regard to the Khcr- el Odeid and would even go further than this in mooting Ibn Baud’s demands. MH. HEN DEL supported the War Office view and agreed with the remarks p^^ut a f dog in the manger’ policy.-10- We had continually fallen back from point to point on the frontier- question s making each slight concession to Ibn Saud appear to be a most spectacular one. GROUP CAPTAIN STEVENSON said that the Air Ministry felt that the problem was largely a political one because the cession of the Khor-el-Odeid would not affect the strategical aspect of air communications hereabouts. They had therefore no objection to the Foreign Office proposal and broadly agreed to the remarks of the Admiralty and the War Office. They thought that anything that could be done to help to reach a solution of the South-Eastern frontier problem was a move in the right direction and might ease the general political and defence situation in the Middle East. THE CHAIRMAN did not accept the expression ’’dog- in-the-manger' as a fair description of our policy towards Ibn Saud. It appeared 3 however 3 that the general view of the Sub-Committee was favourable to the proposal that steps should be taken with a view to getting Abu Dhabi to surrender the Khor-el-Odeid to Ibn Saud. In that case compensation would presumably have to be given to A.bu Dhabi in some form or other. MR. RENDER f S view was that it might be well worth the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi's while to make the sacrifice of handing over the Khor-el-Odeid in order to get some sort of guarantee regarding his hinterland frontiers. At present those frontiers were wholly undefined; Ibn Saud’s prestige and authority were increasing 9 and it might well be that more and more of the tribesmen in these areas would transfer their allegiance to the Saudi Kingdom^ sothat it might prove increasingly difficult to secure for Abu Dhabi anything like the territorial frontiers v/e might be able to get him at present. The important point, now that oil had entereOMnto the question, and that, for this and other reasons, some sort of territorial boundary had become necessary, was that we should obtain some undertaking from Ibn Saud that he would not claim any ter ritorial rights beyond a certain Ifsreu The advantages of getting a fixed line would be all on the side of Abu Dhabi, particularly if oil were discovered. The retention of the Khor-el-Odeid could be very little real use to the Sheikh, as it could not serve any Abu Dhabi territory as a port, but it might prove a valuable counter in securing Ibn Saud's acceptance of the rest of the Sheikh's frontier. MR* GIBSON remarked that the Khor-el-Odeid covered the caravan route from Qatar to Abu Dhabi. MR RENDEL, however, did not think this route was of much importance, as the trade was mainly carried out by sea traffic. MR. STARLING said that the petroleum Department supported the proposal to try to obtain a frontier settlement with Ibn Saud. There was much activity in regard to oil along the Trucial Coast, some of which was of great importance If it was possible to ensure stable boundaries by proposals such as the cesq^ion of the Khor-el-Odeid he thought it would be a good thing if the cess^ion ^ere made. One fear was, however, that this concession might not meet Ibn Baud’s demand. If oil was not to be obtained in the vicinity of the Khor-el-Odeid area, he thought that Ibn Saud would attempt to establish a claim wherever oil activities occurred along the Persian Gulf.„i p_ MHoRENDSL recalled that originally it had been proposed to deal r/ith the frontier as a whole. It had eventually been agreed that the only hope of a settlement was to deal with the frontier sector by sector. It was true that there were obvious objections to continuing to make further concessions after we had said our terms were final. But possibly this difficulty might be reduced if the matter were now taken up purely on the basis of the frontier between Saudi Arabia and the Sheikhdom of Abu Dhabi only. Although this would leave the Qatar boundary unsettled, it would have the advantage of getting one importune sec cor at lca.st of the frontier disposed of. As regards the patar boundaiy, we had made the position quite clear to the Standard Oil Company of California, and everything suggested that the Como any would sc unlikely so risi- pro voting ^ aiopube oy crossing the boundary we had indicated to them. It might therefore be possible, as regards the short fitar secror of the frontier to rely on the Company’s underbaking. Meanwhile, there ought to be no insuperable difficulty in settling the Abu Dhabi boundary, since the line wnich we should now be proposing - if we could give Ibn Saud the Khor-el-Oaeid - would be practically identical with cnat will eh he claimed in April 193o. 3 e doubted tbiotuer it uould bo necessary to contemplate ,, r ,• i - -r&gt; /• i--,-.-] t )•-. nT)i [f the oheikh fpn Siieilm Oi. ii.ou jjaaL'-j-. - 1 -- 1 - ^ a money payment, j_ox could be given a guarantee ob protection - vinich ve should probably be obliged 'to give him in any case if oil were found in his territory and exploited by a British Company - ^ , . i -;- n dr tin-; to frontier for his ninuerland, and if he coulu ou^c-mn ^ u.,..±. - m - r .,Y- rrm-^dorwiblv on the balance, even if He lost he would gam c oma .luyj. c-uj-., the Idior-el-Odeid.The alternative was to go on as we were s with a perpetual potential source of friction with Ibn Saud^ which might lead to serious difficulties in the event of war 3 or even in the event of the discovery of oil in the neigh bourhood of the boundary. Moreover &gt; the longer the frontier remained undecided 9 the further and the more effectively Ibn Saud was likely to extend his influence. MR. GIBSON was of opinion that the idea of the extension of Wahabi influence was greatly exaggerated and that it would not result in any permanent injury to the Trucial Sheikhs. THE CHAIRMAN felt doubtful about the suggestion that a settlement could be obtained with Abu Dhabi without money payment. He drew the attention of the Sub-Committee to the following statement contained in the India Office note:- 'Ibn Saud would not value a concession for which he had to pay* and the money would apparently have to be found by His Majesty’s Government who would no doubt be willing to pay ’ 1 • He would like to hear the Treasury view on this point. MR. HALE said the Treasury had some doubts as to the Foreign Office proposal. The crucial point appeared to be that given in the India Office memorandum as follows u At the time when the ,, final u offer of the 'Riyadh line' was made in 1935 Sir Andrew Ryan reported that his impression was 'that Fuad’s instructions were to keep Jebel Nakhsh at all costs but that the King would abandon Khor-el- Odeid in exchange'. It seems possible that Ibn Baud* if offered the Khor-el-Odeid* may merely feel encouraged to press more strongly his claim to the jebel Nakhsh, and refuse to agree to a frontier which does not satisfy his claims. -13--14- Throughout the whole series of negotiations Ibn Baud had been given small concessions and then a final offer„ The Treasury felt that the cession of the Khor-el-Odeid would strengthen Ibn Baud' s expectations of more con-* cessions should he continue to prove obsiu.nate 0 They thought that the present was an unfavourable moment to negotiate with Ibn Baud 5 as 5 politically^ it looked as if it was impossible for him to come to any agreement with the United Kingdom. In the first placer, he was considerably embarrassed by our policy in Palestine and ? in the second- he had an intense dislike of the Italians. They thought that it was unlikely that Ibn Baud would throw in his lot with o combination of powers which included Itaiy ? and it was 9 therefore; doubtful whether it was worth our while to offer Ibn Baud any concessions at a time when he could not possibly get over his embar rassment over our Palestinian policy. As regards the financial aspects of the possible cession of the Khor-el-Odeid 5 the difficulty would be to ask Parliament to vote any money for this project which would seem to partake of tne nature o.l ! ‘Danegeld and which in the end might result purely in blackmail. MH HENDEL said he had not contemplated any money payment and considered that the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi s agreement to the proposal would have to be obtained by means of guarantees. With reference to Mr. Hale's remarks as to the unlikelihood of Ibn Saud s throwing m his lot with a group of Powers including Italy in war. he was of opinion that the possibility of Ibn Ssud being forced into the enemy camp could not be excluded. We had nothing to offer him, except the maintenance of the status .gup, while our enemies might well find it worth their while to forego any direct advantages for ri\-15- themselves in Arabia and to try to buy Ibn Baud’ s support by offering him territory at present under our control or protection. MR. SSAI was in substantial agreement with much of Mr. Rendel’s remarks^ but it was difficult to see how 5 by a small concession^ such as the Khor-el-Odeid 9 anything could be done to overcome Ibn Baud’s difficulties. Ibn Baud was no doubt embarrassed by our Palestinian policy ? but a small concession could not ensure his friendship with us 9 nor even could a frontier settlement 9 until the Palestine problem had been decided. He feared that 9 by making the offer of the Khor-el-Odeid we might weaken our own political position in the Gulf 3 whilst achieving nothing in smoothing our relations with Ibn Baud. It would only be justifiable to make the sacrixice if we could be sure of achieving our object of placating the Saudi King - whose real difficulty was Palestine. MR. BENDSI agreed generally 9 but pointed out that in view of the Cabinet’s decision it was necessary to consider whether or not Ibn Baud could be given something. The cession of the Khor-el-Odeid and the frontier settle ment were no doubt small in comparison with the Palestine problem 9 but it was quite conceivable that a situation would arise where a small matter might turn the scale. ie possibility of oil being found in the disputed area iso affected the issue. If oil were found in the hinter- and of Abu Dhabi before the frontier was settled* an cute controversy might easily arise with Ibn Baud which ight equally in the event of a crisis servet 0 turn the cale against us. While* then* it was quite true that~16 the cession of the Khor-el-Odeid to Ibn Saud would, in it self s be a small and secondary matter, if it should lead to a final settlement of any considerable stretch of the disputed frontier, it might well prove in certain eventualities to have a quite disproportionate importance. As regards the prospects of finding oil in the areas under consideration MR. STARLING pointed out that it was impracticable to indicate the probable oil bearing areas. It might be that oil would first be worked in Qatar - at any rate much more work in connexion with oil had been carried out in Qatar than in Abu Dhabi* The Qatar concession was covered by an Agreement to which His Majesty*s Government was a party and the area was defined by reference to a map. There should accordingly be no question of ceding any of that territory. He considered that from the Imperial point of view any oil bearing areas discovered in the Persian Gulf should be protected by us. He thought it would be much better to attempt to settle the whole question of the frontiers with Ibn Saud rather than to come to a piece-meal settlement with him 3 a s 9 for example 9 starting with the cession of the Khor-el' Odeid to determine the boundaries to Abu Dhabi only,. MR. RENDER considered that the cession of the Khor-el-Qdeid might make possible a settlement of the Jebel Nakhsh problem, THE CHaIRMAM said that if it was the general view of the Sub-Committee that the Foreign Office proposal for the cession of Khor-el-Odeid to Ibn Saud should go forward 9 it would be necessary to consider what step should next be taken. He understood the view of the India Office to be-17- that 3 in the first place 9 the desirability of making a concession and the method of approach to the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi should be referred to the Government of India and the authorities in the Gulf for their views. MR. GIBSON agreed that this should be the next step aid enquired whether in making the approach it should be explained that any question of making a money payment to Abu Dhabi should be ruled out. MR. RBNDEL agreed that there should be no question of considering any money payment on the present basis. A discussion ensued as to the terms oi the references to be made to the Government of India and the local autho rities in the Persian Gulf. It was suggested 9 and agieea 9 that a reference should also be made to His Majesty s Minister at Jedda* asking for his views as to Ibn Baud’s probable reactions to the offer of Khor-el-Odeid. It was also agreed that the Foreign Office and India Oft ice should co-operate in the preparation of the drafts of the des patches. m. SEAT, considered that all the factors regarding n„r relations mth Ibn Saud should be brought to the notice of the Cabinet and in this connection the CHAIRMAN was of opinion that the tine for referring the matter to the Cabinet would be when the whole case was complete and the views of the local authorities on the Khor-el-Odeid oroblon obtained. MEUTEHANT COLONEL OSBOKNE suggested that much information was already available to the Sub-Committee and that if it were decided to refer the matter to the Cabinet,- 18 - the ty&amp;r Office would like the whole question of our relations with Ibn Saud referred to that body and not only the concession of Khor-el-Odeid, In further discussion as to the terms of reference to the Government of India and the local authorities 9 it was considered that they should be acquainted with the Cabinet’s decision of the 22nd December 9 1937 9 as to the need for finding means of placating Ibn Saud; the question of the cession of Khor-el-Odeid and the possibility of a settlement regarding Jebel Nakhsh, and the possibility of getting a general settlement of the Eastern frontier of Saudi Arabia up to Parallel 22 by the concession of Khor-el-Odeid to Ibn Saud. The frontier south of parallel 22 was a question between Muscat and Saudi Arabia and different conditions applied. CONCLUIONS. THE SUB-COMMITTEE agreed :- (a) To invite the Foreign Office and India Office to obtain by telegraph the views of His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda 9 the Government of India and the political Resident in the Persian C ulf on the proposal put forward by the Foreign Office regarding the possible cession of the Khor-el-Odeid to Ibn Saud in Paper No * M.E.(0) 250. (b) That the necessary telegrams should be prepared in consultation becween the Foreign Office and India Office and be so framed as to cover ai3. tne relevant factors of the situation, including the decision recorded by the Cabinet in December last that possible methods of gratifying Ibn Saud should be explored^ 2* Whitehall Gardens, S.W.l 8 th February, 1938.Ii-creign Office Memorandum (Paper Mo.M.E.(c) 250). v”S Note by the India Office. It is not proposed in this note to discuss at full length the several considerations advanced in the Foreign Office Memorandum, in support of the suggestion that the possibility of making a concession to Ibn Saud in respect of the /Oh. or al Ode id might oe investigated once more. In any case the India Office would not be prepared to express a final opinion regarding the desirability of making this particular concession or the method of approach to the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi without consultation with the Government of India and the authorities in the Gulf. Probably the best course in the first instance will be to consult these authorities. 2. For the purpose of a preliminary discussion in the Committee the principal points to be considered appear to be: A. The question of strategic and political objections (apart from that due to the recognised ownership of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi) to the cession of Khor al Odeid to Ibn Saud. B. The question of the value of the concession as a •• means (i) of gaining Ibn Saud’s good will generally, and (ii) of securing a settlement of the frontier question. C. The expediency of offering a further concession, having regard to the past history of the frontier discussions and to the possibility of advantages under B which might offset any disadvantages under A. D. The main difficulty,which is a very substantial one, of the assurances which we have given to the Sheikh(r* Dhabi, and the question of the nature of the approach to be made to the Sheikh if the idea of ceding the Khor al Odeid to Ibn Saud i s pursued. A. it is possible that the strategic objections are not considerable. The political objections may be more serious. They were fully explained to the Saudi representatives m the discussions in London in June 1935, when it was pointed out 4 or rlis majesty's Goyarmnent to acquiesce in a. P * i-*- ‘-'‘•'•-“O, sucn as Saudi Arabia, acquiring a new outlet to the sea on the Trucial Coast would be at complete variance wi u h principle of -British policy that required the maintenance of British control along the whole stretch of the Arab Coast irora Qatar to Muscat. We cannot overlook the possibility that, so far from setting a limit to the extension of Ibn Saud’s influence on the Trucial Coast, the cession of tne ICnor al Cdeid may greatly increase his prestige locally, tend to dra/w the Sheikhs into the orbit of nis influence, and form a convenient centre for Wahabi intrigue. The risks would no doubt be diminished if the frontier settlement were accompanied, as it should be, by an understanding of the most definite possible character on the part of Ion Saud to refrain from aggression on, or any kind Ou interference witn, proteges, and a recognition that they are under British protection. But the difficulty of securing sucn a pledge is shown by the history of the Jedda treaty of 1927. Art .6 of that treaty replaced Article VI of the 1915 treaty which was of the desired character by a mere undertaking to Maintain friendly and peaceful relations” with the coastal Sheikhs, and Art.9 abrogated the former treaty of 1915. In the view of the India Office it v/ould in/3. in any case be most 0 ^ + ^ i '' J - rtan ^ as part of any new treaty settlement to obtain an nn^-toHn- .e +■ ■ ■ , ■ -x anaertaking of the kind ootained in 1915 and lost in 1927. Cre further point which may be of importance is that if Ibn Saud acquired the Khor, Qatr would oif 0 s - 1 any lanaward approach save through his territ ory. Ij: 14 18 not desir e5 to suggest that any possible concession, however small, should be withheld in the pursuit Of our aim to retain Ibn Baud's good will, but it is worth considering what value he is likely to set on the cession of the Khor al Odeid. The views of His Majesty’s Minister at Jeddah might perhaps be obtained on this point after we have the views of the Political Resident in the Gulf as to the practicability of the suggested concession. Its Importance /■ .''Sud s eyco must be incomparably less, for example, than that of Aqaba. It is possible that as a factor in securing agreement on the frontier issue its value may be very small. At the time when the 'final' offer of the 'Riyadh line was made in 1935 Sir Andrew Ryan reported that his impression was 'that Puad’s instructions were to keep Jebel Eaksh at all costs but that the King would abandon Khor-al-Odeid in exohang. It seems possible that Ibn Saud, if offered the Khor al Odeid, may merely feel encouraged to press more strongly his claim to the Jeoel flaksn, and refuse to agree to a frontier which does not satisfy his claims. C: It is unnecessary to dwell on the history of the frontier negotiations, in which successive concessions to Ibn Saud culminated in the 'final” offer of November, 1S35. If only the frontier issue were in question it would be manifestly unwise to make a fresh and substantial concession, and. it would be optimistic to expect Ibn Saud to believe that this was indeed our last word. But if the concession is practicable, and/4 . and if it is one which Ibn Saud would genuinely value, then a question of tactics reuse give way before the wider considerations which led to the Cabinet conclusion of 22 nd Decern iDer. D: The assurances which have been given to the Sheihh of Ahu Dhabi are set out in paragraph 10 (ii) of the Foreign Office memorandum. Subject to the views of the Political Resident and the Government of India it would appear that oir P.Cox’s letter ol 1st December 1906 must be regarded as a solemn engagement. It is possible that, assuming the cession of tne .Khor al Odeid to be material in reaching a settlement of the frontier, and that an undertaking similar to that of 1915 is obtained from Ibn Saud, the Sheikh might be persuaded, by representation of the advantages of a definite frontier, to consider the question of ceding part of his territory. But, subject to the views of the local authorities, the India Office would be averse from putting pressure on the Sheikh, and feel that it may be improbable that the cession could be arranged at any rate without monetary compensation. Ibn Saud would not value a concession for which he had to pay, and the money would apparently have to be found by His Majesty’s Government who would no doubt be willing to pay. If the Sheikh should be willing to surrender his rights at all for pecuniary compensation, it is possible that he would regard as adequate a sum which would be of relatively minor Importance to His Majesty’s Government. It is also perhaps possible that Ibn Saud would prefer the cash to the Khor al Odeid; if he should, the payment should be made subject to the definite abandonment of hie claim to that territory. India Office, 7th February, 1938./. UjxJuJ^ Ihis suggestion is put forward by the F.C. in connection with the Cabinet’s conclusion (a propos of Palestine that other directions in which we night secure&lt; the good will of Ibn Saud should be explored. ihe particular suggestion is not a very promising one, because (a) we gave Abu Dhabi an assurance in 1906 that we recognised that the place is in his territory and that we were prepared to prevent its occupation by anyone else; (b) it may not seem worth much to Ibn Saud. We know he sets less store by it than by Jabel Kaksh, his other desideratupi in this quarter, the surrender of which would be even more difficult. Discussion cannot proceed far till we have first consulted Sir T. Fowle and the G. of I. The question wa? during his visit to the Gulf in fact discussed by Mr, Re'ndel/last spring with the former with negative results. Nevertheless, it seems desirable that in view of the Cabinet conclusion and of the rapidly increasing importance of our relations with Ibn Saud, we should show ourselves receptive to the consideration/consideration of any possibility and consequently oe ready to agree to consult again with Sir T. Fowle and with.the G. of I. on the F.O. suggestion. The difficulties, however, cannot be ignored.

It is also perhaps possible that Ibn Baud would prefer the cash to the Xhor al Odeid; if he should, the payment should be made subject to the definite abandonment of his claim to that territory. cct (this document is “_MA^3TY' 3 GOVHEHMENT) . secret.

The Cabinet decided on 22nd December, by 'conclusion 5(c), that various proposals should be considered u for securing the good-will of ibn Saud.» The object would be to counteract as far as possible the inevitable ill-effects on the Arab world of the present policy of His Majesty’s Government in regard to Palestine. 2. One of the most important outstanding questions between His Majesty’s Government and Saudi Arabia is that of the South eastern Arabian frontiers. The prolongation of this dispute is in itself likely to have an adverse effect on our relations with Ibn Saud; and, even if the issue is considered on its own merits and without reference to wider questions of policy, there is a strong case for making a generous concession to Ibn Saud in order to achieve a final frontier settlement, which would have the effect at once of removing a constant source of friction between His Majesty’s Government and Saudi Arabia and of stabilizing the position on the Arabian side of the Persian Gulf. Incidentally the longer the question remains unsettled the stronger Ibn Saud's position is likely to become. Even if Ibn Saud were to die or disappear Saudi Arabia is likely to retain its integrity under-the Amior Saudi. In any case it is unlikely that we should wish to encourage our prot£g6s on the Arabian coast of the Persian Gulf to expand territorially while there is much to be said for establishing definite boundaries while there is an ordered Government to deal with.- In the present-2- acuue phase of the Palestine problem the desirability of reaching a settlement with Ibn Saud has become much greater, and the question arises whether it would not be in the best interests of His majesty’s Government to rnahe a relatively small political sacrifice in order to secure that end. The Purpose of this note is to examine the possibility of a concession in regard to one of the two places in dispute - the j-vlior—el—udeid — on the assumption that the frontier question offers the best opportunity available to us of making a positive contribution to Saudi interests and thus of going some way towards securing the good-will of Ibn Saud in other matters... 3. The origins of the present frontier question date back to the years 1913-14, when the South Pastern boundaries of the Ottoman Empire (which was regarded as including Hasa, Nejd, the Hejaz, Asia and the Yemen) were laid down in two conventions concluded between His I.Iajesty’s Government and the Ottoman Government. The terms of these conventions were not communicated to Ibn Saud at the time; but in 1914 he himself concluded a Treaty formally recognising his depen dence on the Ottoman Government, and there is little doubt therefore that in principle his La jest y 1 s Government were on strong ground when in 1934 they maintained thac as an Ottoman Succession State Saudi Arabia was legally sound by those conventions. On further examination o± Lie legal position, however, it was discovered that a comideraole portion of the territory to the East of the 1913-14 line was under no effective by tribes owing in sovereignty, being mostly dosero inhaoiced practice a vague allegiance to Ibn Saud-3 P2. Zo8G / 35 elone and it became apparent that, while, in principle, the 1913-14 line was a valid boundary, it did not preclude the Saudi Government from putting forward any reasonable claims to any territory beyond that line over which no other ruler exercised authority. It was consequently decided to abandon a rigid adherence to the old Anglo-Turkish frontier and to endeavour to reach a settlement more in conformity with the practical realities of the situation. 4. On April 3rd 1935 the Saudi Government communicated a statement of their claims to His Majesty’s Legation at Jedda« Although these claims were considered by His Majesty’s Government to be in certain respects exaggerated and unjustified, it was agreed that they might serve as a basis for negotiation, and His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda was authorized to maxe certain counter—proposals involving the recognition by His Majesty’s Government of Saudi sovereignty over a large part of the territory claimed by the Saudi Government. Unfortunately, however, both these and later proposals, in which the initial British offer was substantially increased, were rejected by Ibn Saud, who refused to modify to any appreciable extent his original claims in regard to the frontier. The result has been a complete deadlock and suspension of the negotiations, it being considered impossible for His Majesty’s Government to make any advance on their latest and ’’final” offer as represented by the so-called ’’Riyadh” line (see first enclosure in Sir A. Ryan’s despetoh No. 551 of December 10th, 19551 es modified m regard to the position of the SufiR well.5. Meanwhile it had 1)6001116 apparent in the course of the negotiations that the chief obstacle to a settlement of the Northern sector of the frontier lay in Ibn Sand's claims to two places - a hill called Jebel Nakhsh and an inlet called the Khor-el-Qdeid. The question of the Jebel Nakhsh is complicated by the fact that the hill is already included in the Qatar oil concession. In the present note therefore it is proposed briefly to summarize the position in regard to the Khor-el-Odeid only, with a view to ascertaining whether it would not be possible to offer some further concession to Ibn Baud in that area. The Khor-el-Odeid is a small inlet lying in what has hitherto been regarded as Abu Dhabi territory at the South Eastern end of the Qatar peninsula. i.ne territory adjacent to it (mostly barren desert) is thinly populated by nomadic tribes over whom the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi can scarcely be said to exercise any effective authority. The piraatical value of the Khor either to Ibn S&amp;ud, the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, or His Majesty's Government is at best doubtful *TW tu tut the possibility exists that with a certain expenditure . it mi ght he developed into a serviceable harbour; such a harbour would, however, probably only serve any useful purpose if future oil developments in Arabia created a sufficient volume of traffic to provide a use for^a port in such an inaccessible place. As regards the legal^aspect , of the question, it is sufficient to say here that the foundation in law of Ibn Baud's claim is extremely doubtful; , the information available on our files tends to show thatcoastal Tbn Saud has no valid claim to any part of the territory betv/en Qatar and the Musandam peninsula. But it is important to remember that this is not an issue which can be decided solely or chiefly on the basi of legal rights. Arabia is a country in which the ^ ^ . sovereignties of the various rulers have never been CXj&gt;sU-r/^ W ° learly defined&gt; and 11 would impossible, even if it were desirable, to clarify the position on a purely - legal basis. In much of the territory in question the degree of ciutuority exercised the ve.rious rulers is so vague, and their rival claims are so conflicting, that it would scarcely he feasible to devise a settle ment which took only strictly legal titles into account. It may he said that this is a question which more than any other should he judged solely in relation to the practical realities of the situation, since our only concern is to bring about an early and equitable settle ment with the Saudi Government and we do not wish to prolong a somewhat unprofitable dispute over territory which, when all is said, and done, is of no overwhelming value to anybody^ 7. Considered from a purely practical angle, the facts of the situation are as follows 6* Saudi inte rest in the Knor-el- Odeid o The Saudis claim that they need the Khor (a) in order to have an additional port on the Persian Gulf more easy to develop and more accessible to trade than their exist ing ports at Ras Tanura and Uqair, (b) in order to be able to control the smuggling which they contend is carried on from that part of the coast into Saudi Arabia.n ^4%, » 3*97 /} 7 ) r 208 It is probable; however, that motives of prestige deriving from their general expansionist aims play a considerable part in the Saudi desire to acquire the Khor; it must be remembered that one of Ibn Gaud’s most frequently reiterated complaints against His Majesty’s Government is that he is being 'hemmed in' and confined to the barren interior of Arabia while they have retained for their proteges, who could never have maintained themselves \ without their support, the more valuable coastal regions which should properly belong to him-, 9* British interest in t he Kjno r-el-Odeid. This mainly strategic. It is possible that the Khor might be of use as a naval base in wartime, although its potentialities in this respect are still uncertain. it has also been suggests that it is in the interests of His Majesty’s Government to maintain unbroken the chain of British protected States extending from Qatar to Muscat and thus to ensure that the coastal route which forms the only line of communication between the ' ! ’Trucial H coast and Qatar should nowhere pass through foreign territory. It is not evident, however, that the maintenance of direct communication with qatar in wartime is a vital British interest, in view of the douotful strategic importance of Qatar itself, although it is possible that its importance may increase in future if oil should be discovered in Qatar territory. Further, the argument regarding the necessity of maintaining communication with Qatar in wartime seems in reality somewhat academic, since if His Majesty’s Government were to be involved in a war in which Saudi Arabia remained neutral, the latter would be unlikely to oppose the maintenance of communications through Saudi territory, whereas if Saudi Arabia were an enemy belligerent, it should be comparatively easy for His Majesty’s Government to establish control over the Persian— 7 — Gulf littoral between -.atar and Muscat* The cession of the Mhor-el-Odeia to Itn Sana would* of course* render the position of Qatar somewhat more isolated, since the whole of its land frontier would then march with Saudi territory 10 * Oh,jections to cession of the Khor -el-Q dei d to Ihn Saud, These are: (i) The argument, based on the considerations mentioned in t he preceding paragraph, that it would be disadvantageous to His Majesty's Government to allow a powerful State such as Saudi Arabia to acquire a new outlet to the sea on the ’Trucial H •aoasto The force of this argument is somewhat vitiated by the fact that there is strong evidence to show that Ibn Baud’s influence in the Trucial coast hinterland is rapidly increasing, and :nao consequently if we fail to reach an early settlement of the frontier question this can only facilitate the further extension of Ibn Baud’s authority* ihus it is quite possible that if no agreement is reached we may in a few years' time be faced with claims of a far more exorbitant nature than we are at present, e e g 0 in places like Baraimi in the hinterland of Muscat and Abu Dhabi, which may be of considerable importance in view of their oil possibilities* The view, therefore that the easiest and most effective method of setting a definite limit to Saudi expansion would be to conclude an early settlement with regard to the frontier, even if this involved the cession to Saudi Arabia of the Khor-el-Odeid and/or the Jebel Hakhsh, seems at least an admissible argument and one which deserves further consideration.8 (ii) The main oojection to the recognition of the Saudi claim to the Khor-el-Odeid arises from the fact that from 1878 onwards His Majesty's Government have on various occasions indicated that they regarded the Khor-el-Odeid as Ahu Dhabi territory D Thus in 1878 Sheikh Zaid of Abu Dhabi was assisted in sending an expedition to exterminate the pirates of Cdeido The pirates fled before the expedition arrived,, out it was made clear that Her Majesty's Government regarded the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi as responsible for what happened at Odeid and recognized that place as his territory* Later 9 in 1881 9 Sheikh Yasin bin Than! of Qatar was told, in reply to his enquiries 9 that Her Majesty’s Government could not agree to his rebuilding Odeid M as the place is an appanage of Abu Dhabi*' 1 Again in 18915 when the Ottoman Government tried to send a mudir to Odeid 5 diplomatic representations were immediately made on the ground that Odeid belonged to Abu Dhabi and the Ottoman Government abandoned their project in consequence* Finally in 1906 His Majesty’s Government gave an undertaxing to the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi whereby they recognized the Khor-el^Odeid as belonging to that ruler and undertook to prevent anyone else from occupying it* This assurance was contained in a letter dated the 1st December 1906 from Major (later Sir Percy) Cox to Sheikh Zaid bin Khalifa 9 in which the latter was informed that ''while they (1*6* His Majesty’s Government) ’’recognize that the place is in your t erritory and are '’prepared to prevent its occupation by anyone else but yourself, ’’they are not satisfied that its re-occupation by you would ’’h.ave any good or peaceful result 9 and for that reason are 'not inclined to assist you in re-occupying the place*'11 If on general political grounds it were considered desiraole to meet Ton Saul's claim to the Khor~el-C‘deid in return for a final settlement of the frontier question, it would Still he necessary to find some means of inducing the Sheikh 01 Ahu Dhabi to waive his rights under the 1906 assurance® The brief exposition of the present position contained in the foregoing paragraphs has been made with a view to suggesting for consideration that the practical ooj eetions to ceding the Khor~el~01eid are relatively so slight, and the advantages to be gained from a final settle- ment of the frontier question so considerable, that it would be worth while making an effort to overcome the difficulty arising from the 1906 assurance in order to facilitate such a solution. If this view should be approved, the question w r ould arise as to the best line to take with the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi in order to secure his consent to the proposal® No doubt ihe India Office would be able to mane some useful suggestions on this point, but meanwhile the following possibilities suggest themselves? (a) The offer of some monetary compensation to the Sheikh® It seems doubtful, however, whether this would be practicable, since the Saudi Government are in financial straits® Special sanction would be needed for an offer of compensation by His Majesty's Governmento (b) To represent to the Sheikh the lasting advantages of reaching a final settlement with regard to his frontier with Saudi Arabia, as against the doubtful value of a place of which he makes no use, from which he derives no revenue, and over which he exercises no effective authority®Kaa&amp;Ks .

With regard to (al. T dove,, T ' 1 daresay I may be in a position to throw some further light on the situation after my forthcoming visit to Qatar. 3 . With regard to (b). I will see what further details I can get, but on the really important aspect of this question which affects us, i.e. whether these payments are in any way formal tribute, or can be regarded as a recognition of Ibn Saud as tie overlord of the payers, I can answer straightaway in the negative. Whatever payments may be made are in the nature of the ancient Danegeld or the modern blackmail. The Shaikhdoms of the 3ulf impinge to a greater or less degree, except in the case of Kuwait there are no demarcated frontiers, on Saudi territory, and Ibn Saud by stirring up his border tribes, and in various other ways, can make himself a nuisance to his Shaikhly neighbours. The latter have to look after themselves, since only in the case of Kuwait are we committed to defending them by land , and take the line of least resistance by paying him - Ibn Baud - blackmail, which flatters his vanity and fills his pocket. The actual sums paid doubtless vary with the rise and fall of Ibn Baud’s prestige. In general I do not regard the practice of any great moment and when the relations between/ J.G.Laithwaite , Esquire, The India Office, London.r between ,ny p,rti 0 ul, r Shai.h and I bn S aud assume importance ' as xn the case of Qatar where we may have to undertake special c anmitments, we can always tell the Shaikh - as I am about to editorial language 'this correspondence must now cease* 1 .

Ministry of Foreign Affairs replied in a note (text by bag December 29th) vrhich has been supplemented by conversations with Fuad. Attitude of Saudi-Arabian Government is this: (1) Until final settlement as to disputed area is concluded, oil people from Saudi side will not enter it, proviaea bnere is similar abstention by company operating in ^rao ocaces on Persian Gulf. (2) They have always been ready to conclude Obstacle has been unwillingness of Eis majesty s agreement. Government to recognise n actual situation of ..hat is in reality in possession and under influence 1 ' of Ibn Sand, Consequently, (3) as to proposed Mission they ask whether rus Majesty's Government do not share their opinion 't a.,t it is advisable to agree upon frontier in principle first, by specifying either places or co-ordinates. 2. Ibn Saud clings as tenaciously as ever to Jabal hakhsh, Khor-al-Odeid and Sufuk, from motives of prestige exacerbated by poverty and smell of oil. Several papers from Bushire on the files bear out Ibn Sand’s statement that it is he, and not our friends, who administers at least the first two of the points in dispute. I am aware that history of the case^goes much further back, and that settlement °y L&amp;?* ufldec *'* 1 w nut What I want.to avoid is forcing issue while been ruled out. i international2, international situation is so disturbed, and X think it would De v.-ortn v/hile to refrain iron prospecting in disputed area and to drag out negotiations and wait for better tines. Could we not reply in sense of following paragraph? 5, His Majesty’s G-overnnent are glad to learn of instructions which have been given to Oil Company operating in Hasa; they cannot see how it is possible to make any further concession in regard to a frontier which they adopted in accordance with history and essential needs of Arab States concerned; but in a spirit of conciliation they will see that Oil Company operating in those States does not enter the disputed territory for the present. They do not share view that proposed mission is pointless ? since their contention is that Saudi claim is based in part on incorrect topographical data. Object of mission would not be to bind either side but to establish certain facts, and His Majesty’s Government trust that Saudi Arabian Government will agree to its despatch. 4o Use of phrase n for the present 1 ' would show that his Majesty’s Government were not necessa-rily preparea co prevent prospecting in disputed area until conclusion of an agreement with Ibn Baud. 5. The King will probably cone to Jedda on January 10th or later to meet French High Commissioner iiom ^yri^, I should like to be prepared with a reply on this subject; out I know how complicated it is and if I have no instructions by them I will speak in such a way as will I hope ensure that Oil Company working in Saudi territory will not enter dioputcd zone whatever happens* Addressed to Foreign Office ho. 105.

Dear Chancery, In the record of the talk with representatives of the California Arabian Oil Company about the frontier at the base of the Qatar peninsula (Foreign Office despatch Do. 490 of the 23rd December) there is an error in paragraph 5. By inadvertence the latest line offered to Ibn Baud was described as ’’from the starting point South of Qasr es Salwa etc.” This should of course read ’’from the starting point Forth East of ”Qasr es Salwa..... etc.” Would you kindly make the necessary alteration in your copy of the record. Yours ever. Eastern Department. The Chancery, British Legation, Jedda* Copy. (i^ 7422/258/91) r rr . /. m 8424 ’ 193 7 j Jia stern Ar ab j an Pron ciers In accordance with the procedure agreed on at the Lladle East (Official) Sub-Committee meeting of the 8th November Mr. Rendel received onaielSth December, Hr. Hamilton and Hr. Ballant ne of California Arabian Oil Company. They were accompanied by Mr. c-ibson of the India Office, and Mr. Brenan was also present. Mr. Rendel recalled that, when the Standard Oil of California first obtained the Hasa Concession, His Majesty’s Government had taken steps to explain their view of the legal situation, as regards the frontier between Saudi Arabia and the British protected territories in Arabia, both to Ibn Saud and to the United States Government for the information of the United States oil interests concerned. The legal position was still unchanged, and the legal frontier between Ibn Saud’s territories and the territories in Arabia under British influence was still therefore, in the view of His Majesty’s Government, the blue line defined in the Anglo-Turkish Conventions of 1913 and 1914. But His Majesty’s Government had made it clear to Ibn Saud that, while this remained the legal position, they were quite ready to reach a commonsense settlement of the frontier based on the facts of the situation as they existed to-day. They therefore were x^repared not to press their claims to certain territories to the east of the blue line, which were in fact v/andered over by tribes owing allegiance to Ibn Saud. But no settlement of the frontier had yet been reached. On the other hand His Majesty’s Government had definite treaty obligations to the Arabian rulers under their protection, and in particular to the Sheikhs of Qatar and Abu Dhabi. They f ' could/could not therefore allow Ibn Saud, or any company operating under a concession from him, to encroach on territory which they had officially recognised as belonging to these rulers« His Majesty’s Government had now heard that the California Arabian Oil Company was operating in the neighbourhood of Qasr-es-Salwa. This was not only east of the blue line - so that ? strictly speaking, the Company had no legal right to operate there but was also so near the maximum line which His Majesty's Government were prepared to concede to Ibn Saud, that they felt it important to make the position as regards this line quite plain, both to Ibn Saud and to the Company, since it would be most unfortunate if che Company were to attempt to extend its operations beyond it e 4, The present position then was that His Majesty's Government had offered to Ibn Saud a maximum line, which was the utmost they could concede to him without failing in their obligations towards their protected rulers» This line had not yet been agreed upon, and until a new agreement was reached the legal situation was still governed by the 1913-14 Conventionso But His Majesty’s Government, who were anxious to make matters as easy as possible for Ibn Saud and companies operating in his territory, were prepared to raise no objection to the Company operating up to this maximum line, provided it were not crossed* 5« Mr* Rendel then gave Mr * Hamilton a sketch map of the base of the Qatar peninsular showing the latest line North East' offered to lb:.: Saud (i*e 0 from the starting point rteutk of Qasr es Salwa oc Sufuo in its newly ascertained position). He/s 247 ) ; K m s plained that a siailar eommunicatlon had been made to Ibn Saud on this question through His Majesty’s Minister , Jedda, and he repeated that the consequences would be most unfortunate and embarrassing if the Company were to extend it operations into either Qatar or Abu Dhabi territory as shown on thifc map. Hamilton explained that the Company had obtained ^om Ibn Saud a ruling how far they could go. The past thing they wished to do was to cause His Majesty’s Government any embarrassment, and they entirely appreciated the position. They had not at any time crossed beyond thp u ueyona the line shown on the ma P ? anc ^ 'th-ey would take careful nofp oh uj- note ox the position for their future guidance. '• Mr. .oallantyne, while appreciating the action of His Majesty’s Government in giving the Company this explanation, said that he presumed that His Majesty's Government were not trying to bind Ibn Saud in any way through the Company. His meaning appeared to be that he assumed that His Majesty’s Government would not represent to Ibn Saud that the Company had accepted the line shown on the sketch map as the Saudi frontier, and that Ibn Saud was therefore bound by it. Mr. Rendel explained that there Could be no question of Ibn Saud being bound by the actions of a third party; but the views of His Majesty’s Government in regard to the frontier had been made perfectly clear to His Majesty. It would be quite impossible for His Majesty’s Government to make any further concession to him. ^• Mr• Hamilton and Mr. Hallantyne appeared to appreciate the situation ? and to be grateful for the information and explanations that had been given to them.

He however accuses us of taking action there by allowing'Petroleum Concessions Limited or someone to put up marks. I said that a mar^ had been put up at Sufuk to enable it to be seen from the air but that I should be surprised to learn that any action in area in dispute had been taken by Petroleum Concessions. 2. I trust it will continue to be possible to postpone pros pecting in this area from our side for the present. 3. According to Fuad Saudi Arabian Government favour agree ment according to known places and to principles rather than an examination of physical features. I pointed out that deadlock as to Jebel Nakhsh appeared to us to be due to Saudi Arabian mis apprehension as to physical features. Fuad denied this and went over the other grounds of their claim.

Reported accivitp Standard Oil Company of California noar Qasr—el—Salwa has necessitated renewed consideration of Proposal for unilateral declaration by His Majesty's Government to Ion ^aud defining their view of northern sector of frontier. Such a declaration now seems inevitable s in view of importance of forestalling possible encroachments by United States Company (a) on Qatar territory already granted by Sheikh of a tar to Petroleum Concessions Limited according to map attached to concession, or (b) on territory (e.g. round Khor-el-Odeid) already officially recognised by His Majesty's Government as belonging to Sheikh of mbu Dhabi, and thus covered by prospecting licence granted by him to same company. 2. But it is important that this declaration should not have the appearance of an ultimatum, and it has accor. ingj.y been decided to combine it with invitation to Ibn Baud, on lines suggested in paragraph 7 of Sir R.Bullard's despatch No.47 [of March 27th], for despatch of joint topographical mission to disputed area, to establish exact location of main physical features, such as the Jebel Nakhsh, Sufuk wells, and the other points mentioned in His Majesty's Government's definition of this sector of the frontier. 3. You3* You should s therefore, unless you see strong objection, now address Saudi Government on following lines. His Majesty’s Government understand from recent reports that the Standard Oil Company of California (California Arabian Oil Company) are prospecting in the neighbourhood of Qasr-es- Salwa; the views of Ibis Majesty’s Government with regard to the frontier question in this area have already been communicated to King Ibn Baud, and His Majesty’s Government are still prepared to reopen negotiations for a settlement on the lines they have indicated. In the meantime, they assume that no attempt! will oe maoe by the oaliiornia Arabian Gil Company to pass the line defined in the latest proposals of His Majesty’s Government to King Ibn Baud, so long as no final agreement has been reached as to that line, oinct, however, there has teen some uncertainty as regards the precise location of certain of the physical features concernec, Hir M ajesty's Government propose that a joint jjiglo-Saudi topographical mission should he appointed to establish on 'the spot the exact nature and position of these features. 1. In order to avoid all risk of misunderstanding, this note should he accompanied by a re-statement ox xa,est offer made by His Majesty's Government to the Saudi Government regarding the northern sector of the line,i.e. the definition gi » e » under headings l.M « &lt;* Slr K,t ' * Hoverter 25th 1255 to Fnai Bey Ma at Riyadh (enclesnre in Bin n.Ryar.'s despatch »o.551 c, [D.oe.her 10] 1250) (the so-called 'Biyadh line'), antject to the .oai.ieatisn, in it&gt;n Band's favour, of the portion 0, line defined under head &lt; nv 5 involved by the ne, placing of Bufuk, as ieccoc. i, sir B.Bullard's second letter of March 27th to Bherko • . »3, Yusuf Yasin ? (see final enclosure in his despatch No.17 [of March 27th] ). This takes the point where the line turns eastwards (Key point C), considerably further north than was originally proposed, and involves a consequential modification in the alignment of the line defined under heading 4. 5. As Sir R.Bullard v/as present at discussion here at vlhich above conclusion was reached, and is presumably due to arrive at Jedda very shortly you may prefer to defer action on this instruction pending his return, but matter is urgent and note should not be delayed more than few days. 6. In order further to guard against the risk of the Company crossing boundary into Qatar or Abu Dhabi territory their London representative will be acquainted informally with the position as soon as above com unication has been made to Saudi Government. Please telegraph therefore as soon as this has been done.

They do not affect the substance of the telegram, except possibly for the amendment'in para. 4, where I have sug gested that the note re-defining the line contained in our latest offer to Ibn Baud should define the line up to the frontier of Muscat, and not merely up to the wells of Sufuk* My object in doing this is that the whole of the Abu Dhabi frontier may prove important, particularly if the Standard Oil Company of California should decide to continue its operations south-eastwards, and it would be a great nuisance to have to re—open the whole question pre maturely if they did so. I doubt, however, whether we need J.P.Gibson, Esq*, India Office define/define the line any further than this, partly because the definition I suggest carries the line so far east that there can be very little danger of the Company extending its operations so far into the Great Desert, and partly because we are not yet in a position to make any definite proposal to Ibn Saud regarding the precise boundary between his territories and those of the Sultan of Muscat and Oman. 1 should be grateful if you would let me know as soon as possible whether you concur in the draft. I see that, according to Conclusion (c) of the meeting of the Middle East (Official) Sub-Committee, it v/as agreed that the draft should also be concurred in by the Colonial Office. I am not quite clear why we arranged this, as the Colonial Office are not really concerned, but in order to be on the safe side I am sending a copy of this letter to Shuckburgh, asking him to let me know as soon as possible ¥/hether he has any observations.

This was largely due, in tne opinion of the Foreign Office, to the unfortunate effect on Ion Saud and on ..,rab opinion generally of our policy in iralestine# lion Gaud felt t.iat it would nov/ 'be far more difficult for him than it might have been two years ago, to agree to a settlement under which he could be represented as having handed over ^.rab territory to the foreigner, hven, then, if the difficulties caused by I bn Gaud’s claims to the Jebel Hakhsh and the Khor-el- Odeid could be surmounted, and if Ibn Saud could be induced by the new proposed concession in the neighbourhood of Sufuh to accept the line we were offering him, on the ground that it differed so slightly from that which he himself had put forward in April, 1935, it seemec most unlikely that an agreed settlement of the frontier could be reached. GIF R. BULLARD observed that a further circumstance which was likely to render the King more difficult on tne frontier question was that the efforts ox one S bandard Oil Company of California to find oil within Saudi territory nad hitherto failed. It was still possible that oil might be found further to the east, and it had become so important, for King Ibn Saud to have a new source of revenue that ne was now much less likely than before to agree to any limita tion of his claims in tils area..ts. RBiraEL went on to point out that the inEediate question for settlement vas what policy should he adopted i n vi piv nf 1 oae iact caat the Standard Oil Company 01 California were now prospecting in the disputed area and in the immediate neighbourhood of the frontier line we had proposed. He recalls that, when the Hasa oil concession was originally allowed - owing to the attitude of the British compm to -&lt;-11 into one nancis 01 an American Company, the latter had made circuitous enquiries, through the State Department, as to the eastern boundaries of Ibn Sand s territories. In reply, they, and the State -Department, and ning Ibn 3aud himself, hari all been tola that lis IIaj-e&amp;ty' v s u-overnivient regarded the eastern boundary of Saudi Arabia as established by the so-called ''blue line', laid down in the Anglo- Turkish Conventions of 1913 and 1914, and the Company had been warned not to extend its operations to the east of that line. It would, of course, be possible to remind the Company and Ibn Saud of that warning, and of the fact that His Majesty's Government still regarded the ’'blue line” as the legal basis of the situation. But there were strong objections to this. In the first place, It would probably mean an acrimonious dispute, not only with the United States Company, but also28 -5- *) with tiie United States G-overmient, and it was desirable to avoid this if possible. Secondly, it would certainly nean a very unpleasant dispute with King Ibn Saud, and serve further to e rib it ter Anglo-Saudi relcitions, which had already been so severely strained by the Palestine policy of his Kajesty’s Government. Finally, it would be against the interest of His Majesty^ Government themselves to adopt a policy which might have the effect of unnecessarily depriving King Ibn Saud of a possible source of revenue. It was extremely desirable, in fact, from the British - as well as from the Saudi - point of view that Ibn Saud should acquire some new and steady source of revenue, such as was moso likely to be furnished by the discovery and exploitation of oil in his dominions. The acquisition of such a i j to oremote tne stability source of revenue would do muc^ uo pio. of his Kingdom, and it was clearly to our interest that Saudi Arabia should become as stable and prosperous as j &gt; _ r-\ r'' '1 P* ■p CL*'J 0 X 1 /XctiXC 13-1 possible. Ibn Saud was au preset m Q ra difficulties, and if his financial situation became desperate, he would be the more tempted - in- view of the strain imposed on Anglo-Saudi relations n • tn ncccpt help from some by our Palestine policy -r+pnv His lack of resources other cuarter, e.g. -ftaly. 11 the scale in turning him might thus well tip ane up extremely j the results iai^ni against us, c?.nc. serious* ■-6- THE CHAIRMAN appreciated the force of this argument, hut asked whether, if King Ihn Saud f s reaction to affairs in Palestine was as serious as Mr* Rendel had represented, there was not a risk that he might turn against us in any case* In that case, would it not he better that he should he in financial difficulties, and that his Kingdom should he threatened with disintegration? Should we not he less seriously threatened hy a disunited and impoverished country than hy one whose resources had, hy our own action, just heen augmented? MR. RENDEL and SIR R. BULLARD were unable to agree with this argument,-, In their view, the likelihood of Ihn Saud turning against us would he much reduced if he could secure a stable source of revenue, while, on general grounds, they considered that British interests would best be served by anything which tended stabilise the international situation, and make the ab countries more prosperous and contented, than hy the velopment of disturbed conditions and the weakening the forces of law and order. In any case, we had ready offered King Ihn Saud a frontier line, and rtually abandoned any effective claim to the territory his side of that line. It would he most difficult substantiate such a claim, since, even when the 1913 ,d 1914 Conventions had been concluded with the Ottoman ipire , we had avoided any clear definition of the atus of the territory on the non-Ottoman side of the ne , s0 that it had remained, so to speak, a vacuum. We g ht have claimed to hold King Ibn Saud back, had we or?■ our proteges put forward effective m • + lective claims to this area; - as things were at present, it would he e X traordinaril y - ficult for us to keep him out of territory over which neither we nor our prot^s had ever exercised any effective rights, Mr. Rendel felt strongly therefore that it would he a mistake to attempt to challenge the action of the Standard Oil Company of California in pros I ,eotln g in any territory on the Saudi side of the frontier line embodied in our latest offer. it was essential, however, that the position should he now defined m some way, since otherwise the United States Company operating in Pan 3aud f s territory might easily he led into carrying its operations further to the east and north and penetrating to our side of the line, which might give rise to a very awkward conflict with the British Company and with our client States* Mr. Rendel proposed therefore that the meeting should now consider the desirability of making a unilateral declaration to King Ibn Saud, defining what His Majesty’s Government regarded as the frontier, in much the same way as had been adopted in the case of the frontier between Transjordan and the Hejaz in the notes exchanged at the time of the signature of the Treaty of Jedda. SIR READER BULLnRD recalled that it had been suggested at the last meeting of the Sub-Committee that Ibn Saud should he invited to send a representative to take part in a joint topographical mission to establish the precise position of certain physical features in the Dohat—es-S^lwa-Jebel Nakhsh—Sufuk area#-8- The ob je ct was to give Ibn Baud an opportunity of assuring himself that Jebel Nakhsh really formed part of Jebel Dukhan. He thought that this offer might be combined with the proposed unilateral declaration, in wMch Ibn Baud would be informed that His Majesty's Government assumed that the Standard Oil Company of California would -£-£.9 cee ^ no further while negotiations regarding the frontier were in progress . If made in this form, the proposed communication would have less of the character of an ultimatum, and he did not think that ITm Baud could take offence at it* THE CHalHIvIiiN thought that it might he possible to represent the position to the Saudi Government on the lines that His Majesty’s Government proposed for the time being to recognise a certain line as the frontier, that they affirmed their intention of not going beyond that line themselves, and that they trusted that the Saudi Government would do the same* But what would be the position if, after the proposed joint reconnaissance had taken place, Ibn Sand maintained that it proved that the Jebel Nakhsh was in Saudi territory^ MR* RENDEL thought that this possibility could be excluded* Ibn Saud might not agree to recognise any particular frontier, but it would be most difficult for him to argue, once the facts had been established on the spot that the Jebel Nakhsh was part of the mainland rather than of the '&lt; 4 atar peninsula. The organic connexion of the Jebel Nakhsh with the Jebel Dukhan would be apparent to any observer, as both Sir T. Fowle and Mr. Rendel had realised when flying over the area last March.r 9 Qr* THE CiIAIEMilH then referred to the proposal which had been discussed at the last meeting of the Sub-Committee that, as a means of assisting him financially, Ibn Baud might be given part of the oil royalties on oil struck in or near Jeb e 1 IT aldish, SIR R;::i-LDEE nULLhRD said that it had been proposed to base this arrangement (which would correspond to that reached in 1926 between Turkey and Iraq.) on the assumption that some of the oil which might be found at Jebel -aldish actually came from within Saudi Arabian territory. SIR IRE::CHARD FOALS pointed out that any attempt to persuade the Sheikh of Qatar to relinquish any part of the oil royalties in question would be strongly resented. Such an arrangement would moreover be patently unfair. As things stood he did not think that Petroleum Concessions Ltd. had i much intention of beginning operations in Qatar for the time being, unless the Sheikh pressed them to do so. At present they were engaged in boring for water at the Sheikh’s re quest, but they had not hitherto shewn any great eagerness to begin oil operations in Qatar. MR. GIBS OH said that he had derived the same impression , ■ ^ -ug pad hed with Mr. rongrigg of from a conversation wmcn no UciU - Petroleum Concessions Ltd. THE CHAIEMAN suggested that in that case it might oe possible to get -both companies to agree mutually no, to undertake operations in Jebel NaJdish. MR . REIIDEL doubted whether we could, consistently with our obligations towards Petroleum Concessions Ltd. , aavise them to conclude such an agreement. - q 4-1-.,-,-j- wliile he had gameied SIR T^S CT-aEE POLLS said that, »» (London ^ »' t,, MW*— «-) «“ “* «««*«»«-« ” fmission powers to establish the frontier. -•-HE CHAlhliAlT said that he thought that such a proposal would raise numerous difficulties. The main object at present was to head off the American Company, and this purpose -should be achieved by the action already proposed. mR. GIBSON observed that in order to eliminate any possibility of the American Company advancing further while the Saudi Arabian Government were being approached, it might be advisable to convey some intimation to the Company of the view which His Majesty’s Government had adopted. SIR TRBNCHA-jD FOWLS suggested that,, as time was short, it would be satisfactory if some communication could be made to the American Company direct. MR. nSNDSL said that it might be possible to ask hr. Hamilton, the Company's London representative, to call at the Foreign Office, and inform him unofficially of the position vis-a-vis the juiiiortcan Government. He felt strongly, however, that no coraaunicatxon should be waae to the Company until the Saudi Arabian Government haa been approached. This would take a fortnight or three weeks, but it was better that the co.amunication should be made through His Majesty's Legation at Jedda rathe, than through the Saudi Arabian Legation in London, SIR TRSIiCHARD FOWLS urged the desirability of . . the uronosed action with all possible exped- completing the pioput- ^ • -a- -r, o-f irpp-nins the activities ition.

Since 1930 King Bin Saud extended his influence to Dhafrah (Abu Dhabi) and to Buraimi where tlie Darau and some of the Awamir tribes became his subjects. As the Trucial shaikhs were weak and could not prevent outside raids, they were com pelled by circumstances to complain to the Saudi Arabian authorities against their subjects and in all cases the punishment was satisfactory amd much more than what they would have inflicted against the offenders. In order that they may not offend the Saudi authorities they never punish of enders caught by them on the Trucial Coast but send them to the Amir of Hasa for punishment. Trucial subjects (oj enders) do not run away to Saudi Arabia which is not safe for them. If Trucial Coast offender, runs awa to -audi Arabia he is punished and not returned. 3# vvitout the aid of the Amir of Hasa, the Trucial Shaikhs will not be able to stop raids by subjects of Saudi Arabia and, in my opinion, it is more to their advantage that they should be left to continue the present practice until such time as stand on their feet without the aid of others. they can To2 * VS To prevent them from lng or sending offenders for punishment by SaucM / oauoi Arabia would mean offending Saudi authorities who will no doubt insti-ate th instigate their subjects encourage to reM In ,ol.l C„,„. „, e 3 n. 1)th a »„ M tt ,„ , sk 0 „ p Mp , g , la . t 3&gt;aal iraM&lt;n out-cue «-.« thus create e very difficult position for u« ,C »e .ould not t,, , b i, to check their intrigues.

An additional foliation sequence is present in parallel between ff 2-394; these numbers are printed, and are not circled.A previous foliation sequence, which is also circled, has been superseded and therefore crossed out.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>This volume primarily concerns British policy regarding the eastern and south-eastern boundaries of Saudi Arabia, specifically those bordering Qatar, Abu Dhabi and Muscat (i.e. the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman). Much of the correspondence relates to British concerns that oil companies operating in the region may begin prospecting in disputed territory.References are made to various existing and proposed lines, including the 'blue line' (laid down in the non-ratified Anglo-Ottoman Convention of 1913 and redefined and adopted in the Anglo-Ottoman convention of the following year). Reference is also made to a 'final offer' proposed by the British to the Saudi Government in November 1935, since which time no conclusion has been reached.Matters discussed in the correspondence include:The reported activity of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company (Casoc) near Qasr-es-Salwa [Salwá, Saudi Arabia] (located east of the blue line), and whether this activity necessitates a renewed effort by the British to reach a settlement with Ibn Saud [‘Abd al-‘Azīz bin ‘Abd al-Raḥmān bin Fayṣal Āl Sa‘ūd] regarding the Qatar-Saudi boundary.Ibn Saud's claim to Jebel Nakhsh [Khashm an Nakhsh, Qatar], which lies in territory included in the Qatar oil concession.Whether the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi should be persuaded to cede Khor-el-Odeid [Khawr al ‘Udayd] to Ibn Saud.The impact of Britain's Palestine policy on Anglo-Saudi relations.The Foreign Office's suggestion that the Khor-el-Odeid question should be submitted to arbitration.In addition to correspondence dating from 1937-39, the volume contains copies of correspondence dating from April 1904 (including translations of two letters from the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi), which discusses Abu Dhabi's claim to Khor-el-Odeid.Correspondents include the following: the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (Lieutenant-Colonel Trenchard Craven William Fowle); the Political Agent, Bahrain (Captain Tom Hickinbotham); His Majesty's Minister at Jedda (Sir Reader William Bullard); the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (Edward Frederick Lindley Wood, Viscount Halifax); the Secretary of State for India and Burma (Lawrence John Lumley Dundas, 2nd Marquess of Zetland); the Viceroy of India (Victor Alexander John Hope, Lord Linlithgow); the Minister for Saudi Foreign Affairs [Fayṣal bin ‘Abd al-‘Azīz Āl Sa‘ūd]; officials of the Foreign Office, the India Office, and the Government of India's External Affairs Department.Also included are the following: copies of the minutes of meetings of the Committee of Imperial Defence's Standing Official Sub-Committee for Questions Concerning the Middle East, dated 8 November 1937 and 8 February 1938; a sketch map depicting the various possible boundary lines of south-eastern Saudi Arabia.The volume includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the volume by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence (folio 2).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><geographic>Qasr-es-Salwa</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Jebel Naksh</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Khor-el-Odeid</geographic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Saudi Arabia</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>District Magistrate, Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Committee of Imperial Defence, Standing Official Sub-Committee for Questions Concerning the Middle East</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Saudi Arabia</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Viceroy and Governor-General of India in Council</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for India and Burma, United Kingdom</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Indian Political Service, External Affairs Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Arabian American Oil Company</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Saudi Arabia, Minister for Foreign Affairs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Abu Dhabi, Āl Nahyān dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Petroleum Concessions Limited</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Arabian Peninsula</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Qatar</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Saudi Arabia</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Boundaries</topic></subject><subject><topic>Concessions, Oil, Al-Hasa Province</topic></subject><subject><topic>Bilateral relations</topic></subject><subject><topic>Concessions</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x0002a4#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
