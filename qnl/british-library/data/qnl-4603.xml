The Province of Kurdistan is situated in the hilly districts between Azarbai j an and Kirmanshah, and extending to the Turkish frontier on the west and bounded on the east by Garrus and Hamadan. It extends 24: fcLTsaJchs from north to south and 56 from east to west. “From the river Saruq, * which separates it from J Azarbai] an, to General features. Senna, the face of the country is everywhere the same. It presents to the view either progressive clusters of hills, heaped as it were upon each other, or great tablelands covered with flocks and the tents of the Uyats. The valleys are narrow strips at the foot of the mountains, where the villages are commonly built in situations which protect the few inhabitants that remain in them from the inclemency of the weather. The soil is good and would yield abundance, but the Kurds prefer a pastoral life. The oil plant is everywhere common, and tobacco is cultivated in small quantities. Wooded mountains, separated by narrow valleys and occasional plains, producing excellent pasture, cover the north portion of Ardalan. The woods yield excellent oak and fine gall apples. Between Kaleh Shah Khani and Khizr Elias in Kirmanshah the nature of the country entirely changes, and instead of a succession of verdant hills, inter mixed with deep glens, there are here extensive cultivated plains, bounded by bleak and barren mountains.” Cultivation. Cultivation. ‘ ‘ Land is cultivated under one or other of the following arrangements: Nisf-i-Kari .—Under this system the cultivator and the proprietor of the land divide the produce equally. The cultivator supplies the seed and ^necessary labour. The landlord pays the maliat and the expense of reaping. Dah-du .—Under this arrangement, which is most common in Kurdistan, the produce is divided into twelve parts of which the proprietor takes two, the cultivator ten, the latter paying all expenses. * Also spoken of as Saruk, Suruk or Surkh river. The frontier of Kurdistan (Ardalan) is, however, further south than this river. H. L. R„ A 14 IB2 Yusuf Sharif says the soil is saturated with water, and that water can be obtained anywhere by digging two or three feet. The chief produce of Kurdistan is wheat, grain, barley, rice, cotton, and tobacco (this last in great abundance), vegetables, pumpkins and gourds, cucum bers, brinjals, lettuce, beetroot, cauliflower, potatoes, onions and garlic ; fruits, melons, water melons, cherries (about five kinds), grapes, apples, plums, peaches and walnuts.” Inhabitants. “ The inhabitants of Kurdistan are illiterate but bigoted Sunnis of the Shafi, sect, one of the four sub-divisions of orthodox Musulmans. They are not really fanatical, but become bigoted by being in daily contact with the Shi’ah people. The root of the Persian Kurdish question, whenever it becomes acute, is the religious hatred between Sunnis and Shi’ahs, and the root of the Turkish is the hatred between Muhammadans and Christians. Some of the Persian Kurds have become Shi’ahs, whilst in places the ’Ali-Ullahi are to be found. The language spoken by the majority is Kirmanju, an old Persian patois intermingled with some foreign words. In Kurdistan (Ardalan) and Kirmanshah what is called the Guran dialect is spoken, presenting an even greater affinity to modern Persian. By far the greater number of Persian Kurds are sedentary and pastoral, a great many farm and till the high hill slopes, whilst many more are shepherds. Their habits are nomadic, moving during the summer months into camps on the higher acclivities of the hills above the settled villages. Nomad Kurds are largely Turkish subjects or live on the Turkish border, and perhaps the wealthiest members of the tribe belong to this class, the cultivators and shepherds being as a rule deplorably ignorant and poor. As to what their numbers may be, it seems pure guess-work. Some say one million, some two^some a half. Dissensions and clan feuds weaken them, as they did the Scotch Highlanders, and they do not attempt resistance to the Persians, whose present army is far from formidable, but, in the event of any invasion, the great fact would be that the invaders would find auxiliaries, rather than enemies, in them, which, considering the nature of the country, is of enormous importance. Persian-born Governors are now beginning to replace the Kurdish chiefs who up to now were always Governors of their own districts. In December 1880 there occurred an abortive Kurdish rebellion in Persia under a certain Shaikh Obaid Ullah which, though a fiasco, was from the political point of view of great importance, as it showed the utter impracticability, owing to family and clan dissensions, of a united Kurdish organization, which will probably be heard of again during our time. (For further particulars see Lord Curzon’s Persia, and articles Azarbaijan and Kirmanshah of Gazetteer of Persia, vol. 2, 1905.) Whatever the Turkish Kurds may be, the Persian ones are celebrated for their hospitality and are not at all unfriendly towards Europeans. They are great dandies in dress and the richer ones are always well dressed in clean and good clothes. The national clothing is a short coat and very baggy trousers, and a white calico shirt, the sleeves of which hang down to the ground, with an enormous sash round his waist on which are placed knife and pipe, and they alwaysRevenue.

In 1904 Mushir-ed-Divan is said to have paid the Governor of Kurdistan 30,000 Tumans for the post of Yazir for one year, an outlay made, no doubt, with a view to a subsequent profit. General Schindler in 1902 in the supplement to the “ Encyclopaedia Britannica”, says:— ‘ c Jn proportion to its size and population it pays a very small yearly revenue, only about £14,000, due to the fact that a great part of the population consists of wild and disorderly nomad Kurds. Some of these nomads pass their winter in Turkish territory, and have their summer pasture grounds in the highlands ot Kurdistan. This adds much to the difficulty of collecting taxation.9 Kurdistan, according to Persians, whose love of symmetry is proverbial, has j town, 17 or districts, 17 nomadic tribes, 17 mountains, and 17 rivers. In order to get to 17 some of the tribes are mentioned together; as for the districts, their number is given as anything between 12 and 22, according to the way they are put together by the various governors of Kurdistan. Capital op Kurdistan. Kalul, during his rule, which was from 606 to 629 A. H. (1210-1233), removed Capital of Kurdistan the ca P ital of his possessions from Kaleh Zolm to Palingan which is at 12 farsakhs of the present town of Senneh. He also built a citadel and founded a settlement at Merivan. In 774 A. H. (1373) Hasan, a descendant of Kalul, built a castle and founded a settlement at one farsakh from the present town of Senna and named the place Hasanabad. For 433 years one or the other of these three strongholds was the capital of Kurdistan. Sulaiman Khan, who was named by Shah Seffi to succeed Khan Ahmad Khan, who had rebelled and fled to Turkey, had taken towards the Shah the en gagement to remove the capital from Kaleh Palingan and Kaleh Hasanabad to the site of the present Senna. Faithful to his promise he immediately des troyed the strongholds of Zolm, Merivan, Palingan, and Hasanabad, so that the Valis should in future have no place of refuge from which to defy the authority of the Shah, and built himself a fortified residence and for the people bazaars and mosques on the present site of Senna. For 168 years the town remained but slightly altered, but in 1214 A. H. (1800) Amanullah Khan, known as Amanullah Khan Buzurg, having become Vali, embellished and enlarged the government residence and spent ten years from 1220 to 1230 A. H. (1806-1815) in enlarging the town, erecting mosques, bazaars, and residences, and laying out gardens. Senna. Latitude 35° 12T); Longitude 47° 18'T); Elevation Senna situation. 5,300 feet. The present capital of Kurdistan is Sennenduj commonly called Senna, and known as Dar-ul-Eyaleh; as already mentioned, it was built in 1046 A. H. (1638) by Sulaiman Khan Vali. It is situated 200 miles south-south-east of Tabriz, south-west of Kazvin, 80 miles north-west of Hamadan, 87 miles north of Kirmanshah, north-east of Baghdad, and east-south-east of Sulaimanieh. It is secluded in the bosom of a deep valley, well cultivated and interspersed with orchards of peach, apricot, pear, apple, and cherry trees, and is at once a most remantic and flourishing little town. It was surrounded by a mud-wall, and a small river runs through the town. It is so surrounded by hills that the town is not seen till you are close to the suburbs. Its appearance is pleasing ; the houses are well-built, and the gardens and cultivation in its vicinity are pretty. It enjoys a fine climate, the small valley in which it is situated being protected 14IB B10 Garrison. , from the severity of the winters in this elevated country by the hills around it. It lies in an open cultivated valley with the high peaks of Uvada and U va Anga * to the west, the spurs from which fall to the town. To the south is the high range of Dushand, 10,000 feet. The high mountain called Kuh-Abidar is not more Streets. than 1,000 paces from the town. The streets of Senna are narrow, tortuous or winding, and dirty. The Governor lives in a fine castellated palace, built on the top of a small hill in the centre of the town by Sulaiman Khan, ^ &gt;a * ace * and embellished by the following Valis, and notably by Hasan ’Ali Khan and Amanullah Khan Buzurg. Its water-supply is got by a qanat known as Qanat Hasan ’Ali Khan which brings water from Dasht Sarnudi, east of the town. Haji Farhad Mirza Mu’tamad-ud-Dauleh had barracks for one regiment built in front of the Governor’s palace, some 34 Barracks. years ago. They were repaired by Mirza Muham mad Khan Iqbal-ul-Mulk. There are nominally a battalion of infantry, a squadron of cavalry, and a bat tery of artillery in garrison here. There are six old bronze guns. Senna has 37 mosques and madrassehs and 31 hammams. Most houses have flowing water in their courtyards. Public buildings, Amongst the mosques we may mention that known as Dar-ul- Ahsan, built by Amanullah Khan Buzurg a Mosques. century ago, since which time it has never been repaired This mosque is fine and large, has 24 stone columns, and is covered with tiles, on which, it is said, is written the whole of the Koran. The prayers are said in the mosque in accordance with the precepts of Imam Shafi’ Muhammad ibn Idris. The revenues of the village of Aklijan have been settled for the maintenance of this mosque, but through the carelessness and incompetence of successive ’governors, the endowments have been done away with and the mosque is in a dilapidated condition. The madras- seh (theological college) attached to this mosque, which in the time of Amanullah Khan Buzurg had obtained for itself the rank of Dar-ul-Ilm in Persia, has now no more pupils to boast of. We may also mention the mosque “ Dar-ul-Aman,” which was built in 1268 A. * H. (1852) by Amanullah Khan Kuchick, known as Ghulam Shah Khan. Imamzadeh Pir Omar is buried Immamzadehs. ^ £ 0wn an j h} s remains rest under a large cupola, which has been covered with fine mirror-work by Muhammad Ibrahim. Khan, Nizam-ud-Dauleh in 1306 A. H. (1889). From minute enquiries and notwithstanding versions to the contrary my informant tells me that : ' “ this Pir Omar, it appears, is descended from Imam-’Ali ibn Abi- Talab as follows: Omar ibn Yahia, ibn Husain the martyr, ibn Zeid the martyr, ibn ’Ali Zein-ul-Abdin, ibn Husain, ibn ’Ali, ibn Abi Talab.” *Pfobably Abidar and Ab-i-Hang, and A whang. or in Kurdish Avidar and Avihang, or AvdarAt Senna there is also the tomb of Hojar Khatun, sister of Iman Hiza. Saiyid Yaqub had a mosque built near this tomb which is known as Masjid Hoiar Khatun, and which on account of its proximity to the above-mentioned tomb is considered as “Bast” or sanctuary. Other well-known buildings and gardens of Senna are Amanieh, Bagh Gardens. Husainabad, and Bagh Nishat due to Amman- * ullah Khan Kuchick, and Bagh Khusruabad, which was a magnificent garden at a quarter of a mile to the southwest of the town, due to Ammanullah Khan Buzurg. Adjoining the town to the north-east there is a large cemetery known as Qabris- Cemetery. tan Shaikhan (the cemetery of the Shaikhs) in which it is believed 40 Shaikhs were buried, and it is said that miracles occur at the tombs of these holy personages. In this cemetery on some of the tombstones are inscriptions and dates which show them to be more than 900 years old, which proves that Senna is built on the ruins of an old town ; this is also evident from the fact of Pir Omar and Hojar Khatun being buried in the town. There are many qanats entering the town, amongst others that dug by Mirza Qanats. Yusuf ’ Mushir ud Divan, son of Mirza Muhammad Riza \azir. This qanut has the best water in the town, and is a great boon to the inhabitants : the greater part of the houses in the lower part of the town obtain from it their water-supply. In the quarter of Katerchian there are some springs of good drinking water. Senna has a telegraph office, a post office, a custom house, arsenal, Arm«- D ,^ nian church, and a Turkish Consulate. Every evening the Neghareh Khaneh people play their weird instruments in , T , , , the tower built in the middle of the Sarbaz Khaneh ^ eg are i lane . (barrack square) by Ammanullah Khan Buzurg. At the beginning of last century Kinneir estimated the population of Senna ^ w . at 4,000 souls, of which number 200 were Jews and Popu a ion. Armenians and 50 Nestorians. Thomson in 1868 has 20,000 souls. Mr. T. C. Plowden in 1881 says : “ The population of the town of Senna, as estimated by a Christian merchant, comprises : Houses. Persons. Muhammadans mostly Sunnis .. 12,000 50,000 Jews 700 3,500 Christians .. .. .. 65 300 The Yazir, however, told me that at the last numbering the population of Senn * was shown to be 65,000 persons, and he considered that the city was increasing yearly.” This is no doubt exaggerated as it would make of Senna a more populous town than Kirmanshah. B 212 According to the census of 1295 A. H. (1878) the population of .the town was 24 744 souls or 5,484 families. In 1892 it was estimated that the population had during the last 14 years increased by 1,000 families or about 6,000 souls, and that consequently the population of the town was about 30,750 souls. General Schindler in 1902 (Supplement to “ Encyclopaedia Britannica ”) esti mated the population of Senna at 35,000 souls, at which figure it is safe, I believe, to put the present number of inhabitants. .. Supplies of all sorts are procurable in abundance. There are numerous places well supplied with water on the surrounding hills, where troops could be encamped during the sum- Camping-ground. mer ^ own we re too hot. There are a good many horses to be bought here, Horses. not muc h to look at, about 14-1, but good for work and useful. The tradespeople of Senna pay a sort of license tax, which varies from one tuman to ten tumans per annum, according to their Trades. respective means. The ordinary trades are well represented, but the chief industry is carpet-making, and, as the wool of Kurdistan is of superior quality the carpets (known as Kalicheh and Sajadeh) made at Senna are considered among the best of their kind. Arak is distilled locally by Jews and Chaldeans. The trade of Kurdistan is not very extended, and we only have statistical data for the trade with Turkey. The following'is information, either the result of my own observations or ob tained from Senna merchants, and from Hamadan .and Kirmanshah merchants having trade relations with Senna :— Exports. Gum is exported to Russia vid Ardabil or Exports. Rasht, about 100,000 tumans yearly. 10,000 tumans sa'lab gums go to the United Kingdom. Small quantities of wool go to Kirmanshah. Ghi is produced in large quantities, and much is exported. The price in 1904 was 53 tumans per 40 Hamadan maunds (50 maunds Tabrizi). Tne lamb-skins of Kurdistan are not of very good quality. The cost was in 1904 10 to 11 tumans, per 100, and they are exported to Russia. Gall-nuts are exported to Hamadan. About 20 loads of the kind known as “ Mazuikabud ” are exported to Russia. The gall-nuts are gathered m the mountain districts of Banneh, Merivan, Juvanrud, Sakiz, andAvroman, or received from Penjvin and Sulaimanieh. Tobacco (tumbaku and tutun) is exported to Hamadan and Kirmanshah for local consumption. . .. .. ...- About 150 loads of tobacco (tutun of the Karju district) are exported to Tehran. A small quantity of tumbaku is exported to Turkey. Cow-hides are sent to Hamadan to be curried. Furs are exported to Russia and Turkey. Opium is not produced in Kurdistan. Sheep are sent to Tehran, Tabriz and Hamadan. Dried fruits are exported to Russia. Apricots are sent to the Jaffs across the frontier. Horses and mules are bred in great numbers and exported to the interior of Persia. Many carpets are woven in the province of Kurdistan, but the finer carpets come from the town of Senna. The warp of the finer carpets is generally silk and the woof wool. Kurdistan carpets are usually the size of hearthrugs, 2d square zar.s (about square yards), and cost from 5 to 10 and even 15 tumans per square zar. There are about 2,000 looms in and round about the town. For dyeing the wool, indigo is used for blue and green, madder for red, and onion and vine leav s for yellow. Senna carpets are exported to Europe via Tabriz : carpets of inferior quality are exported to Baghdad. Carpets, henna, worked wood, silk tissues, and a small quantity of haberdashery are exported to Turkey. The orchards of Senna contain peach, apricot, pear, apple, wall-nut and cherry trees, and there is a small trade in dried fruits. Other articles of export to the interior of Persia are woollen socks and cloth ing, fox-skins (for Russia), honey, gazangebin or manna, and the forest products known as Kelkaf, Sichkeh, Kanderun, etc.. Imports. Imports. Manchester goods are imported from Hama dan, sometimes direct from Kirmanshah. Sugar is imported from Marseilles via Baghdad and Kirmanshah. No Russian sugar is consumed in Kurdistan. From an estimate of one of the merchants of Senna the total amount of sugar consumed in a day in the province of Kurdistan amounts to 70 cases. A case weighs from 27| to 30 maunds, and contains about 22^ to 25 maunds Tabrizi of sugar. The cost of one case varies from 9 to 11 iumans. Shawls are imported fom Kirman, Meshed and Yazd. Silk (native) is received from Yazd. Fancy articles and chemicals come from Tehran. Leather is imported from Hamadan; 2,000 to 3,000 tumans per annum. Henna, madder, copper in sheets, and lead are received from Hamadan. Dates are received from Kirmanshah; 2,000 to 3,000 tumans yearly. Iron (old ship and railway iron) comes from Russia vid Ardabil. Spices are imported from India vid Kirmanshah. Indigo is received from Hamadan. •: .14 Rice, first quality,- “ Brinj-sadri,” comes from Rasht. Riee, eeeoftd quality, “ Brinj-rasmi,” is grown in the province. About 1,000 cases of tea are received yearly vid Baghdad Naphtha is received from Russia vid Ardabil and Rasht. Paper, somavars and crockery come from Russia. Lemons and oranges come from Mendali vid Kirmanshan. Gall-nuts, raw hides, ghi, tar, gez (manna), iron in bars and worked iron, some cotton goods and mercry and haberdashery are received from Penjvin and Sulaimanieh. The merchants of Senna only deal through native merchants or direct with Russia; they have not as yet opened direct Merchants. relations with other countries. The trade of Kur distan being limited to the export of local produce, such as gums and gall-nuts, and to small imports of Russian goods and a few Manchester prints, some tea and some sugar, no great benefit would be derived by their extending their business relations. Most of the Christian merchants go every year to the Nijni-Novgorod fair. For the trade with Turkey we have now fairly reliable data from the Custom Trade of Kurdistan with House returns, but they only give the items for Turkey. w ^°^ e province.

The importations from Turkey to Mukri and Sujbu'ak pass through the Banneh Custom House. Exports from Banneh to Turkey comprise gums, mercry and hardware, tobacco, native silk goods, and clarified butter. Merivan exports to Turkey consist of the so-called “red” tobacco, carpets, silk tissues, henna, wooden combs, mercery, and dried fruits. Imports from Penjvin and Sulaimanieh to Merivan comprise gall-nuts, iron, worked iron, dates, a few prints, tea and sugar. The imports from Turkey to Sakiz comprise sugar, dates, cotton goods, tobacco from Alan, and tea. Exports consist of guns, dried fruits, salt and native silk goods.22 Notwithstanding the protest of the Persian Government, Merivan and the districts of Khurkhureh, Salar, Hubetu, and Tilehkuh are, during five or six months of the year, occupied by the Turkish tribe of Jaffa. In contravention of the treaty between the Persian and Turkish Governments, the chiefs of this tribe, after having practically destroyed all the villages of these districts, purchased them, and have retained possession of them. During the time of their sojourn in Persia not only do the Jaffa import and export all their goods and produce without paying customs duty, but they also help Ottoman subjects to import merchandize, specially prohibited goods, such as arms and ammunition and aniline dyes, with- * It is said ihat a large amount out P a yi n g duty. These goods are then for warded under the escort of Jaff savars to Mukrr, Afshar, Zinjan, Garus, Hamadan and vicinity of Senna.

DISTRICTS OF KURDISTAN. Baneh. The district of Baneh is 24 farsakhs to the north-west of Senna. To the west it touches Sauj Bulagh Mukri, to the south Baneh (District). Turkey, to the east Merivan, and to the north Sakiz. It is sub-divided into smaller divisions and is usually governed by members of the same family, chosen, however, by i he Persian Governor of Kurdistan. The population consists of hill people and nomad trib s, wild and un-uly, and all Sunnis. In 1878 the population was 32,240 souls and the Asl Maliat 5,600 Tumans. The following is a good example of the law'essness of the inhabitants and also of their courage. On the 18th of Zilhajeh 1308(1891) Yunis Khan, Governor of Baneh, invited his uncle Haji Mustapha and his family, and m urdered him together with one of his sons; his second son, Abdullah Beg, a lad of 15, although wounded, attacked Yunis Khan, knocked him down with his khan jar, and killed six of his men before being himself despatched by Yunis Khan’s people. According to native information Baneh has one large village or small town and 200 villages “Ad scription of one of these vi’lages will suffice, for all exist under the same conditions, and are alike undefended. The inhabited portion of the vil ages is commonly a mere kernel, enclosed in a mass of v neyards and o chards. Each house forms a portion of a small block, divided off by narrow, ill-paved lanes, never as much as 20 feet broad, and often less than ten feet; each has a central court or ya d, a high wall and strong gate facing the lane, and 1 igh walls on the othe- thre sides ; beyond the court is usually a small patch of garden. Of the better class of houses a large proportion are two-storied, with upper windows looking on to the lane. The walls of all are built of very hard mud. With a double story the elevation is about 20 feet; the lower walls 3 feet thick, upper 2 feet; the roof flat with 6 beams of poplar, varying in length from 10 to 15 feet, covered with a thin layer of mud. A parapet wall of mud, bulletproof, runs round each roof. Such buildings would afford no protection against shot, but would be difficult to fire. Bazaar shops cover less ground. The vineyards or orchards or (locally) gardens extend for more than a mile round the larger villages, being thickest on the line of irrigation. They cover from 2 to about 10 acres of ground, are thinly planted, and en- c'osed by solid mud walls, of 12 to 15 feet high, with a single small gate. Narrow lanes and watercourses wind through and about them, affording very indifferent communications. Though the height of the ga-den walls and the thinness of the cover within them detract from their defensive value, they might, with some little labour, be converted into an excellent screen very difficult to penetrate in the face of even undisciplined opposition. The tract about Baneh and between it and Maragheh is fairly supplied with forage. Fuel is plentiful and water easily procured. Carriage in any quantity is not to be found. There are no large droves of camels and but few mules.” The greater part of this district is mountainous and covered with forest*.24 The trees are mostly oak, and according to natives give fourteen products, some of which are gazangebin (manna), mazuj (gall-nuts), ballut (acorn), sichkeh, kelkap, kharnukh, kezkeh, kanderun, gazaleh, angushter, darsiah,* but I have been unable to find the translation of these last eight words. Other products of this districts are gums, mastic and tragacanth, and large quantities of tobacco (tumbaku). The inhabitants do not cultivate much grain and are obliged to import a certain amount of barley and wheat. In this district, however, a plant called “ deymilleh” is grown which supplies the greater part of the food of the inhabitants. It is a kind of millet with long stems and 1 irg; ea s. Partridges are plentiful here, and much hunting with hawks is done. The principal place of the above district is Baneh. Lat. 35° 39' Baneh town. Long. 45° 54' Elev. 5,400 feet. Baneh is situated on the bank of a tributary of the river Kalvi, and there is a deep ravine on the other side of the town. It numbers at present 900 houses, of which 40 are of Jews and 90 of Ottoman subj ts. In 1832 Gerard estimated the population of this place at 600 houses. It has 1 hamman, 8 mosques and a Masjid-i-Juma, and 3 caravanserais to accommodate merchants who come here during the gall-nut gathering season. The Governor of the district lives here. The town has a prosperous '.ook» and the Khan s residence is fine and well furnished. A peak, Arbaba, three miles south of the town, has its slopes covered with vine yards more than half-way up. Near to Baneh the road traverses a mud flat—a depression in the plain some two miles in width, which wou d form a serious obstacle to the passage of guns or waggons. This mora s—which it really is in winter—may be turned by a long detour over a rough hill skirt. The town was formerly known as Beruzeh and, according to Rich who visited Kurdistan in 1820, it was a wretched, filthy place, scarcely deserving the name of town. The Governor of the district of Baneh is called Sultan, a title granted by Nadir Shah to the frontier governors as a retort to the title of Pasha (Pad-Shah) given by the Turks to their frontier governors, and to the present day the custom of sounding the neghareh khaneh in Baneh, instituted by the same Nadir Shah, js still maintained. The town of Baneh was built about 160 years ago by Isma’il Sultan, a gover nor of this district and descended from SulaimanBeg, who is buried’one mile to the west of the town (some say this tomb only contains one of his teeth), and whose tomb is now a place of pilgrimage, in the vicinity of which it is considered a crime to touch the trees, so that there is a fine forest at this spot. Haji Zaman Khan, who for 18 years was governor of Baneh until he fell in disgrace when Mu’ayyid-ud-Dauleh was governor of Kurdistan, is also a des cendant of this Sulaiman Beg. * Dr. Oskar Mann mentions also qir (tar), qau, muLLur and shatlankush (peeteh- Kuhi in Persian).THE CHIEFS OF BANEH. 1 . i | Shams-ud-Dm.

It is a mount- Sakiz (District). tainous district south-west of the SamKaleh district. It has one large village or small town and 360 villages. The inhabitants are more orderly and civilized than those of other parts of Kurdistan and dress like the people of Senna. They are Shafi s of the Tankeh Pir Silsiieh Nakshbandi sect, the chiefs of which live at Sulaimameh. hor 1879 according to the census made then the population numbered 34,024 sou s. The Asl Maliat is 6,305 tumans, but the deputy governor is said to pay the governor of Kurdistan from 14,000 to 17,000 tumans for his post. The fields are watered by water from springs or streams. The Jighatu flows through the district. There is spring and autumn cultivation : wheat, barley, peas, lenti s Indian corn, millet, cotton, melons and water melons, and tobacco (tutun)m great quantity are grown. A considerable anrunt of tobacco is exported to Tehran, Azarbai- jan, and Zinjan. Sakiz is famous for its honey. Fruit-gardens are numerous.

The district is said to have 94 villages and had in 1892 14,000 inhabitants. Autumn and summer crops of all kinds. Asl Maliat, 7,110 tumans, 4 krans, and 400 dinars. In 1878 Napier wrote of this district: “A portion of Kurdistan traversed by the Tabriz-Kirmanshah caravan road between Khusruabad and Sarab-Kat. The country is undulating and easy. The mahal, or district, numbers over sixty villages, of which three only— Sirishabad, Kurba, or Kurveh on the high road, and Kaslan—have over a hundred houses. The villages are all dome-roofed. The average number of houses in each is 20 to 30. A good deal of grain is exported hence to Hamadan, locil prices being somewhat higher than at Bijar, but less than half the current rate at Hamadan, distant only two days’ journey. Carriage is scarce ; mules may be procured in the villages, but not in large numbers. No camels. It is in the Kurdistan province on the borders of Kirmanshah. A large tributary of the Kizil Uzun known as the Kichigird or Zalvarrud crosses it; it is unbridged, but offers no obstacle save at times of high flood.” Karaftu. This district is 18 farsakhs from Senna to the north. It numbers fifteen villages and was formerly part of Sakiz. It num- Karartu. berg about inhabitants and its only produce is wheat and barley. Asl Maliat, 522 tumans. This wonderful district is famous for some underground dwellings. Mr. Waffelaert says it may be an underground city similar Maktareh San-baba. tQ that at ghustar. I give word for word the descrip tion of it as I received it in writing from a native. “There is here a remarkable taleh, the termination of which nobody has yet been able to reach. On entering the place with lights one sees to the right three rooms cut in the rock, the doors and windows of which are of finely chiselled stone. To the left is a tomb known as Makbereh Sari Baba. A few paces further on is a courtyard 20 zars long and as many wide. The ground is damp and the place is full of sticks; it is said that anybody entering the place with a stick must leave it here. In this yard there is a block of stone resembling a coffin, and inside itI -&gt; 35 is a skuil of great dimensions. Many people who have, out of curiosity, visited the place relate that near the coffin are very large footprints which reappear as soon as defaced. “Past this place one goes through a stone door to a room with many doors, and every door leads by many steps to other rooms, some upstairs, some downstairs, and it is absolutely necessary for visitors to take straw to strew on their way so as to find their way out again. “ The late Riza Guli Khan Yali visited this place with a crowd of attendants with lights and provisions. For two whole days he walked about the place, but Mahmud Khan, his uncle, having got lost and only being found with great difficulty, the party returned to light again. Amongst other wonderful things this party saw was a bazaar, like a blacksmith’s bazaar, in which were bars of iron, 10 feet long and i zar thick, but they were falling to pieces with rust; and in other places were bales of goods which fell to pieces on being touched. ”* Tilehkuh. A district about 18 farsakhs to the north-west of Senna. It numbers 24 vil- Tilehkuh lages. The inhabitants are unruly and quarrelsome and number 4,240 souls. The governor of the district has no fixed residence. Cultivation : spring and autumn crops. Tobacco (tutun) is also cultivated. Water- supply from springs. Many gardens have of recent years been planted. Asl Maliat, 1,506 tumans. The inhabitants are Sunni Shat’is. Khurkhureh. A district about 18 farsaJchs north-west of Senna. It numbers now about 50 villages, but boasted some years ago of over 90. One of the villages is known as East and has a good mosque and takieh built Bagt about 400 years ago in which Shaikh Ibrahim is buried. This is now a place of pilgrimage. The village numbers 80 houses. Another village is Mulanabad which numbers 50 families. The inhabitant’ are descended from the great Shaikhs of the country and one of their ancestors, Shaikh Hasan, is buried in this village, his tomb being surmounted by a cupola. His mother is buried close by, and he ordered that anybody coming on pilgrimage to his tomb should first visit his mother’s. Khurkhureh is a village of about 50 families, on the side of a mountain known by the same name. Down this mountain asOeam rushes with great noise, which sound is reproduced in the onomatopoetic name of the neighbouring village Khurkhureh. The village of Khurkhurc-h is 2 farsaJchs distant from Vashehdareh, a village not far from the Turko-Persian frontier. From the village of Khurkhureh to that of Keilu in that of Saral it is 4 farsakhs, the road passes at 2 farsakhs the village of Surmusi. Khurkhureh. MiTanabad.

Wilson —Persian Life and Custom-.) E 236 District. district itself has 8,000 inhabitants, all Sunni Shaft’s. The Governors or Sultans of this district were always taken from its principal families. The district is watered by the river Khurkhureh. Cultivation : wheat, barley, millet, cotton, tobacco (tutun), grapes. Asl Maliat without Furuat, 690 tumans. Merivan. Merivan This district is 18 farsakhs to the west of Senna, forming one of the frontier districts. Merivan numbers 200 villages and about 26,000 souls. The inhabitants are very troublesome and given to fighting and are Sunni Shaft’s. Most of them possess rifles and the district can raise 1,500 tufangchis. There are many families of Saiyids settled here. Much rice is grown ; wheat, barley, Indian corn, peas and lentils are also grown. In spring a small Persian garrison is stationed bore to prevent the Jaffs from invading Persian territory. For this, the governor of Kurdistan is allowed by the Central Government, it is said, 30,000 tumans out of the revenue of the province. Asl Maliat,. tumans 1,655. Lake Zeribar is in this district. The following are extracts from Mr. T. C. Plowden’s report on a journey through this district : “The plain of Merivan on which the fort stands, contains about a dozen villages, ct which Nei and Kanimiran are the largest. Nei can be seen from the fort, and comprises abo it 200 houses. The lofty and rugged mountains of Avroman overlook the fort on the south ; near as they appear to be, they are distant 6 farsakhs, or a long day’s march. There are three passes which lead up the Avroman hills by precipitous paths so narrow that two people cannot go abreast. The hills round Merivan and Avroman are densely covered with a fine forest of oak, walnut, chinar, or plane trees, and various wild-fruit trees. The gathering of gall-nuts is one of the chief occupations of the people, and the nuts are exported, not to Sulaimanieh in Turkish Kurdistan, which is compara tively near, but to Hamadan, some four marches beyond Senna. The fort of Merivan* is a substantial c tone enclosure Kaleh Shuhabad or Meri- about 300 yards square, and was built ’ on years ago van * by Farhad Mirza, M’utamad-ud-Dauleh, during the period of his rule over Persian Kurdistan. The mud used as cement is so friable that extensive repairs are required every year. On the walls of the fort were mounted half a dozen bronze nine- pounders cast at Tabriz forty years ago. They were in a very dirty and uncared for condition, and the carriages were broken. The guns had not been fgred for five years. Thirty artillerymen and a company of the Fauj-i-Kurdistan constitute the garrison. Water is brought by a conduit from a spring outside the walls, but there are also two wells inside the enclosure. The fort is commanded by some low hills on the right, and can he of little use for the * Lat. 35° 31'; Long. 46° 19'; Elev. 4,725 feet.protection of the district. The men of the garrison said that they got no pay, but were allowed a half-oke of barley a day; and even this pittance was not given regularly. They lived by robbing the Government and the people as often as they got the chance. They complained bitterly of their treatment and of the Govern ment, and wished that some foreign power would annex the country. The local levies, or militia, of Merivan are subordinate to the Mustaufi Bashi, or Hakim of Merivan ; they consist of about 1,500 tufangchis, armed with flint guns, and 200 horsemen. Only half the tufangchis serve at one time. A regi ment of infantry, nominally of eight companies of 100 each, and called Fauj-i- Kurdistan (Zafar regiment), is furnished by the surrounding districts as their quota for the regular forces ; this is not under the authority of the Hakim of Merivan, but is commanded entirely by its Sartip. The names of these officials, respectively, areMirza Muhammad Sadik and Muhammad Ali Khan.* The regiment was armed with heavy muzzle-loading muskets, sighted to 550 yards.” Gerard (27th March 1882) writes “ Merivan (which he mentions as 3 q miles south of Baneh, close to Penjvin) is situated among valleys with lovely grazing-ground. A small square fort, with flanking bastions, is here close to the village : it is of somewhat modern construction. The Kurd civil governor of the district treated me most hospitably, and also the Persian commandant, who has 10 gunners and 30 sarbaz as garrison.” At 2,000 paces from the lake of Zeribar the above-mentioned fort was by order of Nasr-ud-Din Shah, built in 1281 A. H. = 1865., Five years later on the advice of Farhad Mirza, Mu’tamad-ud-Dauleh, the size of the fort was reduced and its strength greatly improved. 40,000 tum'ins were spent on this fort. It has an arsenal, an artillery square, and some guns. To the west of this fort which is called Kaleh-Shaha'bad, Mu’tamad-ud-Dauleh built a settlement usually named now Kaleh Merivan instead of Kaleh Shahabad, and brought to it 100 families, some of which still remain-f The place has a hammam and a mosque, and Muhammad Ali Khan, Zafar-us-Sultaneh, built a caravanserai here. On account of the proximity of lake Zeribar the climate of Shahabad is very hot and unhealthy. At 3,000 to 4,000 paces from Kaleh-Shahabad on the summit of a hill is the old Kaleh Merivan, in olden times one of the strongholds of the Valis and capital of their dominions. It is situated in a position of great strength. Some twenty times did Turks and Persians meet in battle array in the plain down below. In this ancient fort Algas Mirza. who had taken arms against his brother Shah Tahmasp L, surrendered in 1005 A. H. (1597) to Surkhab Beg, Yah of Kurdistan, who obtained for him the royal pardon. ^ Exports from Merivan to Turkey consist of the so-called red ” tobacco, carpets, silk tissues, henna, wooden combs, mercery, and dried fruits. i Imports from Sulaimanieh and Penjvin comprise gall-nuts, iron, worked iron, dates, a few prints, tea, and sugar.| At the village of Pilek in the same district Mu’tamad-ud-Dauleh had Hassan Sultan Aurami hanged in sight of his own fol- Pile k. lowers, and put his two brothers in chains, as they had come to oppose him with 1,000 tufangchis. * Now titled Zafar-uUVlulk. t This village now only numbers some t For the year January 21, 1902, to Jan- 30 to 40 families of the Kalkufi branch of uary 20, 1903, exports to Turkey amounted Kalbaghi Kurds, to Kra. 4,808 and imports to Krs. 97,690.41 Senna to Merivan. For this route, the data I have do not agree together, nor can anything be gained by referring to Volume II, GazettShr of Persia, 1905, in which we find Duveisseh (Doissa) given by Gerard as 18 miles from Senna, and Davaiza as 11 by Plowden.

Prof. Dr. Oskar Mann of the Royal Berlin Library, who was travelling in Kurdistan in 1902 to obtain material for a scientific study and grammatical classification of the various Kurdi h dialects, kindly communicated to me the following notes on his journey in Kurdistan. He estimated that he covered one farsakh in one hour and a halti 45 )&gt; The district numbers some 32 or 33 villages and about 4,000 inhabitants. Produce—pomegranates, figs, gall-nuts, and other forest fruits. Wheat and barley and other provisions are imported. Asl Maliat, 74/0 tunians. From Kurdistan there are only two very rough and difficult roads to Avroman across which it is well nigh impossible to pass guns and troops. For this reason the inhabitants are often in open rebellion against the Governor of Kurdistan. In 1286 A. H. (1877) they rebelled and made a night attack on Farhad Mirza Mu’tamad-ud-Dauleh’s camp, and killed 36 of his men. To punish them for this deed Farhad Mirza, having received troops from Tehran, attacked them in their own strongholds, and defeated them and pillaged the two Avromans. The inhabitans fled to Turkey, where they remained for some time*. After this Farhad Mirza always maintained here a garrison of 500 men and sent a governor from Senna, and thus for ten years did he keep this district in perfect order. But since, through the incompetence and short- sightedness of later governors of Kurdistan, the governorship of this district has again fallen into the hands of the descendants of its old governors, and although apparently submissive they are in reality independent. The road from Merivan to Avroman is described in the chapter on Merivan under the heading ‘- Road from Merivan to Juvanrud and Ruvansar.” The Avroman range lies south-west of and parallel to the Zagros mountains. The hills are wild and rocky, only traversed by footpaths. Between Avroman and Zagros is a narrow valley, through which runs a direct road to Kirmanshah from Sulaimanieh, called the Shamian road. Through this valley flows a little river, which comes down from the Gurran and falls into the Diala (Ab-i-Shirvan). Dr. Oskar Mann mentions Razau as the capital of Avroman Takht). This village is the residence of, and belongs to, ’Abbas Guli Sultan. Avroman Lihun. This district is 17 farsakhs south-west of Senna. To the west and south it touches Turkish territory. The district is very Avroman Lihun. difficult of access on account of the Sirvan river which limits the district on the Persian side and which being of a certain depth cannot always be easily forded. Noghud, its chief place, was taken in 1878 by Farhad Mirza’s troops and was set fire to, and its Noghud. gardens destroyed. The district numbers 22 villages and about 4,000 inhabitants ; it is covered with forest and has not been cleared for cultivation. Produce—figs and pomegranates, which are exported and sold or bartered against wheat and barley. Asl Maliat, tumans 300. Water for drinking is from springs. Below Noghud near the river Sirvan is a tomb, said to be that of Imamzade Ishak. To the east of this district there is a village named Hajij in a very picturesqe but rugged spot. There is here the tomb of Ha P'- Imamzadeh Sultan Obeidullah, brother of Imam Riza, and known as Kusseh Haji]. The inhabitants of this village wear a special46 head-gear and special clothes and are held m great respect, and were always exempt from tolls and custom dues. Beyond the mountain on the side of which is this village and on the path leading to Senna is a river running down a ravine 40 zars deep (I am told). Over this ravine a small suspended bridge made of vine trees has been thrown, across which the villagers carry travellers and donkeys. My informant had been over this bridge but, said he, “ once is enough for a life time.” JUVANRUD. A district about 16 farsahhs to the west of Senna. Its limits are west Shahr-i-Zur, south Zohab and Kirmanshah, east Juvanrud. f villages of Senna and north Avroman. It numbers over 100 villages surrounded by forests, the usual trees being mazuj balut, and bon.* The inhabitants number 15,000 and are Sunni Shafi’s of the Tarikat Pir and Silsileh Nakhshbandi. In the district there are many families of mulla$ named Sadiki, the descendants of Abu Bekr Sadik. Cultivation—spring and autumn crops such as wheat, barley, Indian corn, millet peas, lentils, water-melons, melons, tobacco (tutun) and pomegranates. Other' products which are exported are:—gazangebin (manna), honey, copal, tragacanth. The alucheh (small plum) of Paveh is celebrated throughout Kurdistan. The honey of Juvanrud is very much appreciated ; it is called Asal-Shah- Badra'n and its like is only found in Sujbulak-Mukri. It is found m barren places difficult of access in holes at a depth of 1 or 2 feet from the surface. Industries of the districtSticks, rifle-butts, pipes and pocket knives. The district is watered by a river descending from the Juvanrud mountains and by Sarab Huli, a spring in a delicious spot near Paveh. Asl Maliat, 4,098 tumans. Juvanrud (Village) ; Elev. 4,755'. This village is in the centre of the district which is 6 farsahhs either way. The haleh was built by Ammanullah Khan Bu- Juva imd village. zurg 12 24 A. H. (1810) on a hill over 20 zars high, but is now fast going to ruin. Water was brought from the mountains by means of an ancient dam. About 20 years ago, by order of Government, another haleh or fort was begun here but never finished. The climate at this spot is not good. The village has four mosques. Of this village Captain Burton (1897) says “ A town of Persian Kurdistan, about 40 miles north-west of Kirmanshah. It stands on the right bank of a small stream running down from a range following wooded vrassy hills, which runs along the south-west of the Halabij ah-kirmanshah road parallel to the Shahu mountains. The country round is grassy and undulating, and to the west rise the high peaks of the Saraban mountains and the Bamg. s range 10 miles distant, the country between being clothed with thick forests of dwarf oak. Water is abundant and the numerous channels show a large area _ of ground formerly under cultivation. The town now (1879) is deserted and in rums ♦Gall-nut, oak and myrobolan.having been recently raided and burnt by Habibullah Khan of the Jaff Kurds of Juvanrud. It formerly contained 100 houses in addition to the residence of the Vakil of Juvanrud, the principal landowner, and the governor’s house. There was also a small bazar and some shops. The inhabitants are slowly returning, the governor, Sharif-ul-Mulk of Senna, having been dismissed, and Navab Khan, son of Mushir-ud-Divan of Senna, appointed in his place. The feud with the Jafs is at an end. There is room for camping. Wood, water and grass are abundant. Some supplies are obtainable from villages a few miles off in the direction of Kirman- shah, and, when the town is rebuilt, should be plentiful. The climate is hot for three months of the summer, but very pleasant in spring and autumn, and the soil appears most fertile. Roads to Kirmanshah, the Zimkan river, and Paveh pass through the town. The people fled with their flocks and herds to the Zarna mountain. They are tenants of the Vakil of Juvanrud, the chief landowner of the district.” In 1905 when at Ruvansar I (H. L. Rabino) was advised not to continue my journey to Juvanrud as the inhabitants had deserted their villages on account of a dispute with the Governor. This seems to be their usual procedure when they wish to obtain reduction of or exemption from taxes. One of the important villages of Juvanrud is Paveh, two stages west of p v ^ Kirmanshah on the upper road to Sulaimanieh.* The village, which is called in Arabic Favej, numbers 100 families and has 5 mosques, one of them ancient and known as Masjid Abdullah Omar. There is in this district a cave called Kavat which has never been explored, Kavat cave. and which, it is said, is well worth a visit. Eilak. Eilak.

There are many opinions as to the identity of Ardalan,* from whom are de scended the Yalis of Kurdistan. Some say he was son of Ardishir Babakan ; accord ing to others he was the son of Khusrau, the miller who slew Yezdijird, King of Persia, and whose children prospered in a wonderful manner. Others again say that Ardalan’s name was Khusrau, that he was a miller; whilst, according to Abu- Muslim Maruzi, he was named by Abul ’Abbas, Ahmad ’Abbasi, Governor of Kurdistan, whence his name of Ardalan, his sons and descendants being known as Bani-Ardalan or the sons of Ardalan. Be this as it may, Ardalan and his family were for years chiefs of some importance ccc a nr Mosul and Diarbekir ; and Ardalan, with a large mfiQ—1*910 a tm ’ number of his relatives and followers, removed to e ' * ’ Shar-i-Zor, where in 564 A. H. he ruled over an extensive district. He built the strong citadel of Kaleh Zolm, and little by little extended his rule to the whole of Kurdistan. He obtained, later, possession of Palingan, the seat of the chiefs of the Kalhor tribe, and, having removed to that spot, built there a stronghold, the ruins of which are still to be seen. For 42 years he governed Kurdistan as an independent and illustrious ruler. Towards the end of his life, by order of Jengizian (Jengiz Khan)t he added to his rule Kui, Harir, Shahr-i-Bazar, Ruvanduz and Emadieh. He died in 606 A.H. and was succeeded by his son Kalul. Kalul,J an intrepid ruler, added to his father’s dominions Sakiz, Siah Kuh, Kalamro-’Ali-Sheker (the present Isfandabad) t Kalul, 600—629 A.H. an d Zarin Kamar (Garrus). (1210-1232 A.D.). In 612 Kalul, who is sometimes mentioned as the son of Mulla Fazl Ardalan], ruled over a territory limited east by Hamadan, west by Arbil which is 12 farsaJchs from Mosul, north by Zinjan and south by Kirmanshah, Sunghur and Sulai- manieh then known as Shahr-i-Bazar included on its western frontier Kui, Ema dieh, Ruvanduz and Shahr-i-Zor, and on its northern frontier Zarin Kamar. The Mogul and Tartar armies which ravaged Persia at this time were unsuccessful in Kurdistan, which they frequently invaded, but could neither subdue the coun try nor seize Kalul and the other Kurdish chiefs. Kalul removed his capital from Kaleh Zolm to Kaleh Palingan which is 12 farsakhs from the present town of Senna, strengthened the castle, and built a residence for himself, and bazars and mosques for the inhabitants. He also built a castle and founded a settlement at Merivan. *Lord Curzon says : “ It is only within the present reign that ihis province has been tin roughly subdued to ihe central authority. For e&lt; nturies it was ruled by almost inde pendent Guran chieftains of the house of Bani Ard lan.” But the Bani Ard. Ian deny that they are descended from the Gurans ; they sometimes claim descent from the celebrated Saleh-ud-Din or Sala- din, the famous enemy of the Crusaders, born at Tekrit in 1137 A.D. The Sharaf Namch, or history of the Kurds dating from the sixteenth century, tells us that towards the close of the Jcnghiziars a m m named Baba Ardalan a descendant of the Governors of Diarbekir, and related to the famous Ahmad ibn Merivan, after re maining for some time among the Gurans, gained possession of the country of Shahr-i-zor,” ai d the Ardalan family his tory, with th ■ gradual extension of their power over Persian Kurdistan, is then traced down to the Seffavian period. (I was unable to lay hands on this book. — H.L.R.) -(•Rulers of Persia. Mogul dynasty, 1193- 1335. Jengiz Khan died in 1226.72 Khizr I, 629—663 A.H- He reigned 23 years, and was succeeded in 629 (1232—1255 A.H.). by his son Khizr, who died in 663 and was succeeded Elias, 663—710 A. H. by Ehas, a generous and courageous chief, at one (1265—1311 A.D.). an d the same time the hope and the terror of his subjects. For 47 years Kurdistan enjoyed quiet and peace and under his rule. Khizr II, son of Elias, was of a religious and quiet disposition. He pass ed his time in prayer, and was a just governor Khizr. II, 710—746 w ho never oppressed his subjects. He even consi- A.H. (1311 1346 A.D.). dered it contrary to the precepts of the Koran to collect revenues and taxes from his subjects, and his only thought was the prevention of disorder and the maintenance of peace. The Turks hearing of his disposition sent an army against Kurdistan. Khizr ! settled with them without bloodshed, and handed them over the eastern frontier of Kurdistan, that is, from Shahr-i-Bazar to Arbil, with Kui, Harir, Emadieh and Kuvanduz. His governorship lasted 36 years and he was succeeded in 746 by his son Hasan. Hasan, even more attentive to the wants of his people than his father, wrote a book of rules and regulations for the army and Hasam 746—784 A.H. the people, so that everyone should know his duty (1346—lo83 A.D.). an( j his rights. He enlisted 3,000 young men for the army and trained them with great care. They were day and night invited to his table, and in two or three encounters with the Turks they covered them selves with glory. In no engagements with Hasan’s troops did the Turks ever gain any advan tage. In 774 he built at one farsakh from the present town of Senna a very strong castle, the ruins of which are still to be seen, and founded a settlement called Hasanabad which still exists. He died in 784 A.H., having ruled Kurdistan for 38 years. Bablul, his son, was a courageous but blood-thirsty man, who never forgave an Bablul. 784—828 A.H., injury however slight, and was thus often the cause (1383—1425 A.D.). 0 f mourning to his people, and of discontent and even exasperation to his army. His subjects rebelled two or three times, and it was only through the efforts of Ibrahim Beg, his, Vazir, a man of great intelligence, that he remained in power. He died in 828 A.H. after a governorship of 44 years. Manzar, his son, by his mildness and equity made the people forget his father’s Manzar 828 862 A.H- cruelties. He ruled for 34 years, and was succeeded (1425—1458 A.l&gt;.). ill 862 by his son Mamun Beg. Mamun Beg having put in order the affairs of his government, improved and Mamun Beg I, 862—800 rendered flourishing his dominions, and trained his A.H. (1458—1495 A.D.). army, marched against the Turks, and after a struggle of years reconquered the frontier towns of Shahr-i-Bazar, Arbil, Kui, Harir, Emadieh, and Ruvanduz. As a precaution against insurrection and invasion he left part of his army at Ruvanduz. So renowned was he on account of his great courage and intelligence the the Bani Ardalan became known amongst the Kurds as Mamuni.After ruling his dominions for 38 years he assembled the notables of the coun try, and in their presence divided their possessions amongst his three sons. To Bakeh Beg, his eldest son, he gave the districts of Zolm, Shahr-i-Zor Golambar, Shamiran, Haveran, Vaveran, and Noghud ; to Surkhab Beg, Hashi Palingan, the present Senna and Kalamro-’Ali-Sheker, Mehreban and Kellash which is the present Javanrud ; to Muhammad Beg, Saruchek, Barazag, Shahr- i-Bazar, Alan, Arbil, Kui, Harir, Emadieh and Ruvanduz. He then entreated his sons to live together in good fellowship and harmony. He died a year later leaving his sons in peaceful possession of their governor* ships, the two younger ones submissive to Bakeh Beg, their brother. Bakeh Beg for 42 years ruled over his own possessions, looking after his Bakeh Beg, * 900—942 A.H. brothers’ interests at the same time. He died in 942 (1495-1536 A.D.). A.H. Bakeh was succeeded by his son Mamun Beg. Two years after his succession Mamun Beg II, 942—45 a large army Was sent against him under Husain A.H. (1536-39 iLD.). Pasha by Sulaiman Khan, Sultan of Turkey. Mamun Beg with 4,000 horsemen met the enemy on the 8th of Zicardeh 944 A.H. and from morning to night he resisted 20,000 Turks. The battle was fierce. During the night, having gathered the remnants of his men, Mamun Beg retired to Kaleh Zolm, where for a whole month he resisted the Turks, who had surrounded the town and cut off all communications. Mamun Beg seeing the uselessness of further resistance, and wishing to spare further hardships to the inhabitants of Kaleh Zolm, fled at night with some of his attendants towards Constantinople, and on reaching the Court of Sultan Sulaiman Khan was cast into prison. The Turks, on hearing of his departure, devastated his possessions and returned to their own country. Surkhab Beg, son of Mamun Beg I, and consequently uncle of Mamun Beg XI, on hearing this news in 945 A.H. seized his nephew’s possessions as well as SurkhabBeg, 945—975 A.H. the possessions of Muhammad Beg, his younger (1539—1568 A.D.). brother, and thus became ruler of the greater part of Kurdistan. He paid allegiance to Shah Tahmasp Sefavi, and built in the district of Merivan at the top of a high mountain, a strong fort, the ruins of which are still to be seen, as a place of refuge for the inhabitants in time of war. Muhammad Beg fled to Constantinople and took refuge at the Court of Sultan Sulaiman Khan. The Sultan, angry at Surkhab Beg’s conduct, released Mamun Beg, gave him Hilla for his maintenance and that of his family, and sent Rustam Pasha, Sardar Akram, with 3,000 troops with Muhammad Beg and Mamun Beg to devastate the part of Kurdistan belonging to Surkhab Beg. Rustam Pasha was met on the 24th of Rajab 947 A. H., in the plain of Shahr- i-Zor, by Surkhab Beg with 8,000 men. Three times the Turkish vanguard numbering 10,000 men was repulsed, and for 8 days Surkhah Beg kept up the fight in which 7,000 Turks and 3,000 Kurds were killed. Surkhab Beg, to save the remnant of his army, took refuge in the fort of Zolm, which was immediately invested by the Turks who also ravaged all the surrounding country. For two years Surkhab Beg successfully resisted all the efforts of the enemy until Shah Tahmasp sent Husain Beg with 15,000 men to his rescue.

U1B J74 the surprise of the Turks on hearing of the approach of Husain Beg, of whose arrival they were only apprised, when he was but two farsakhs from Kaleh Zolm. The death of Rustam Pasha, which occurred just as this news reached the camp, was to a still greater degree the cause of the retreat of the Sultan’s army. Surkhab Beg, on hearing of Rustam Pasha’s death and of the arrival of the Persians, left the fort immediately with all his men. Apprised of this Husain Beg on his side, fell on the Turks who after a feeble resistance were repulsed ; some fled and some resisted. Muhammad Pasha with 600 Turks took refuge at Kaleh Zolm, which Surkhab Beg had left, and got the latter’s wives and children to intercede for him. Husain Khan, the Sardar of the Persian army, let himself be moved by their prayers, and Muhammad Pasha with his men were allowed to depart unmolested. Husain Beg and the Persian troops covered with glory returned to the capital, and Surkhab Beg resumed in peace the governorship of Kurdistan. Shortly afterwards Surkhab Beg removed the seat of his government from Kaleh Zolm to Kaleh Merivan. In 956 A. H. Algas Mirza, a brother of Shah Tahmasp, who had fallen into disgrace came to Shahr-i-Zor. The Kurds of that district immediately turned against him, and Shah Tahmasp sent Bahram Mirza and Shah Guli, the Keeper of the Seals, with Ibrahim Khan and 2,000 horsemen to seize him. His men having been dispersed by the Persians along the frontiers of Shahr-i- Zor and Merivan, Algas Mirza, seeing he could expect nothing either from Turkey or from Persia, fled to Kaleh Merivan and took refuge with Surkhab Beg. Surkhab Beg sent to the Court of Shah Tahmasp and interceded for his guest, whom he sent with twenty-one of his followers to the Court of Persia, through the intermediary of a certain Nermat-Ullah Kahistani, a personage enjoying the Royal confidence. Shah Tahmasp forgave his kinsman and gave him 1,000 tumans a year out of the treasury. Surkhab Beg had eleven sons : Hasan Beg, Iskandar Beg, Sultan ’Ali Beg, Yakub Beg, Bahram Beg, Zulfiqar Beg, Shams Beg, Shah-Savar Beg, Sarukhan Beg, Gassen Beg, Bessat Beg. He named his third son Sultan ’Ali Beg, the most courageous of his sons, his successor, and Bahram Beg, his fifth son, governor of Ruvanduz and Emadieh ; and till 1249 A. H. the descendants of Bahram Beg held this post. Muhammad Beg, known as “ Mir of Ruvanduz,” who for many years fought the Turks, was of this family. After having ruled for 30 years Surkhab Beg died, and Sultan ’Ali Beg, cu ’ai-tj Q 7 * a tt whom he had named his successor, followed him mas 1 shortly after to the grave, leaving two sons, Timur &lt;1008 Khan ^ Halu Khan&gt; Bessat Beg, another son of Surkhab Beg succeeded as Vali in 975 A.H. He was very intelligent and spent ten years quietly given Bessat Beg,* 975—986 U p to learning and writing and the protection of all A.H. (1568—1599 A.D.). learned people. In 985 A. H. Timur Khan and Halu Khan rebelled and fled to the court of IsmaiT II. A year later, in 986 A.H., after the death of their protector they returned to Kurdistan, and gathering numerous followers started devastating Bessat Beg’s possessions. Bessat Beg dying just at this time, Timur Khan succeeded his uncle as Vali of Kurdistan. ♦Ismai’l II Sefavi, 1576—1577 A. D.

Timur Khan had four sons: Sultan ’Ali Beg, Bodag Beg, Murad Beg, and Mir Alam-ed-Din and divided his possessions amongst them as followsShahr-i-Zor, Kezelcheh, Hasanabad and Zolm to Sultan ’Ali Beg; Shahr-i-Bazar, Karadagh, Kui and Harir to Bodag Beg; Merivan, Sakiz, Siah-Kuh, Tileh Kuh, and Khurkhureh to Murad Beg ; Shahr-i-Bazar to Mir Alam- ud-Din ; and then gathering a numerous army marched to the frontier of Kurdistan and annexed Kirmanshah, Sungur, Dinavar, and Zarin Kamar, which is now known as Garrus. In 993 A.H. he led his army against Omar Beg Kalhor, who fled to Shah Verdi Khan, Vali of Luristan. The latter with his troops and the Kalhors advanced to bar Timur Khan’s advance. Although Timur Khan did not expect such a foe&gt; and his own troops numbered no more than a thousand men, foot or horsemen, he immediately and without hesitation attacked the Kalhors. In the midst of the fight his horse fell, and he was thrown to the ground and taken prisoner. Shah Verdi Khan sent him back a few days later, with great honour to Kurdistan. Three years later Timur Khan started to punish the people of Zarin Kamar (Garrus). Daulatiar Sultan, the Governor of Zarin Kamar, opposed him with 3,000 men, was defeated, and shut himself up in the citadel of Zarin Kamar. Not withstanding the small number of his troops Timur Khan led them to the assault of the citadel, but was killed in the breach. His troops, however, undaunted by the loss of their leader, continued the struggle, slew Daulatiar Sultan and 200 of his men, and sacked the place. Timur Khan was buried by his men at Zarin Kamar. Halu in 996 A. H. succeeded Timur Khan. He was an intelligent ai d Halu Khan, 996—1014 coura g eous ru ^ er well beloved by his subjects. For A.H. (1588—1605 A.D.). tw0 or tkree y ears ke considered Sultan Selim Khan of Turkey as his Sovereign and not the Shah of Persia. He transferred the seat of his government from Kaleh Zolm and Merivan to Kaleh Palingan which is in a very strong situation, difficult of access, and was inhabited by Gurans and Kalhors. Halu Khan fortified this place, which is \2 jarsakhs south of Senna, and erected there many buildings. He also re paired and improved the fortifications and settlements of Zolm, Merivan, and Hassanabad. He maintained friendly relations with his neighbours; his subjects prospered under his just but not too severe rule, and his treasury was well re plenished. He resided at one or other of his four forts, and trained such a numerous and powerful army that he threw off all allegiance and declared himself independent In 1012 A.H., Husain Khan, Vali of Luristan, at the instigation of Shah ’Abbas I set forth with 10,000 troops to fight Halu Khan. He invaded Kurdistan and laid siege to Hassanabad, where Halu Khan with a small force was spending the winter. This attack was two or three times repulsed, and he was finally signally defeated. Halu Khan pursued him for four farsakhs (16 miles), killing a thousand Lurs. Shah ’Abbas, incensed at this news, immediately sent a strong army which was defeated and put to flight by Halu Khan on the frontier of Kurdistan. Shah ’Abbas himself, at the head of a large army, set forth for Kurdistan and reached Isfandabad, then known as Kalamru Alishukr. * Shah ’Abbas, 1585—1628 A.D, J 276 Alibali Zengeneh, the Shah’s special Jelodar (mounted attendant), dissuaded his master from continuing this expedition and Shah ’Abbas returned to Isfahan. He showed himself amicably disposed towards Halu Khan, and sent him by Alibali the farman and khalat or robe of honour for Kurdistan. Halu Khan made his sub mission and sent his eldest son, Khan Ahmad Khan, with a large pishkesh (present) to the court of the Shah. Shah ’Abbas received Khan Ahmad Khan with great honour, gave him in marriage Zarinkola, his own sister, and made him promise that on his return to Kurdistan he would induce his father to visit the court. Khan Ahmad Khan, faithful to his promise, after much persuasion, induced Halu Khan to proceed to Isfahan, where he was received with great honour, and after a sojourn of six months sent back to Kurdistan. At Halu Khan’s own request the farman of the governorship of the whole of Kurdistan from Hamadan to Amanieh, and including Kui and Harir, was made out in the name of Khan Ahmad Khan: this was in 1014 A.H. Having taken over the reins of government Khan Ahmad Khan, by the Shah’s Khan Ahn.ad Khan,* order, started at the head of 20,000 men, horse and 1014—1040 A.H. (1605— foot, to punish the people of Mukri and Bilbas. 1631 A.D.) Although these latter were very numerous he • defeated them and ravaged their country. A few who escaped took refuge at Kaleh Kuvanduz. Khan Ahmad Khan pursued them, invested Ruvanduz, and devastated the surrounding country. Unable tj force Kaleh Ruvanduz to surrender on account of the difficulty of the country, he cut it off from all communication, hoping to succeed through famine. Khan Ahmad Khan, whilst out hunting, met a young woman of Ruvanduz who taunted him with his failure, whereupon he ordered a final assault which succeeded. Khan Ahmad Khan appointed his nephew, Kara Hssan Beg, governor of Ruvanduz, Khalid Beg, governor of Khoshnad, and Osman Beg, governor of Emadieh. He also appointed governors to Kui and Harir, and started to conquer Mosul, which he occupied without opposition. The notables of Mosul sent large presents to Khan Ahmad Khan, who, after a pilgrimage to the tomb of Jonas the prophet, allowed his troops 40 days’ rest outside Mosul. He sent word of his success to Shah ’Abbas, who immediately sent him many valuable presents as well as 12,000 tumans in gold ; and at the same time requested him to take possession of Kerkuk and Baghdad. Khan Ahmad Khan occupied Kerkuk and then turned his steps towards Baghdad. Shah ’Abbas, inform ed of his march towards Baghdad, started also on the war path at the head of his own army. Khan Ahmad Khan was received near Baghdad by the notables of that town who brought him regal presents. On the arrival of Shah ’Abbas, Khan Ahmad Khan, with the notables of Baghdad, went out to meet him. After pacifying the country and appointing a proper Vali to that district Khan Ahmad Khan in 1030 A.H. returned to Kurdistan, from which he had been absent about 7 years and. 3 months. Shah ’Abbas died in 1038, and was succeeded by Shah Sefh. By Zarinkola, sister of Shah ’Abbas, Khan Ahmad Khan had a son, Surkhab Beg, who was educated at the court of Persia. The entourage of Shah Seffi turned their master against this young man, whose eyes were for some reason or other put out. Khan Ahmad Khan, on hearing this news completely lost hK reason, and had to be kept in chains by the chiefs of the Kurds, who governed the country in his name. He, however, recovered after six months and collecting his army • * Shah Sefli Sefavi, 1628—1641 A.D.marched to the frontier of his province, took possession of Kirmanshah, Hamadan, Khoi, and Urumieh, and entered into negotiations with the Sultan of Turkey, whom he recognised as his sovereign. He was the object of great favours and received large presents from the Sultan, who gave him the governorship of Kerkuk and Mosul. Khan Ahmad Khan then retired to Mosul and for 7 years Mosul, Kerkuk, Sulaimanieh, and Shahrizur were under his rule. He had governed Kurdistan for 26 years. Sulaiman Khan,* 1040— On hearing of Khan Ahmad Khan’s flight to Turkey, 1060 A.H. (1631—1656 Shah Seffi named governor of Kurdistan Sulaiman ^ Khan, son of Alam-ud-Din and grand-son of Timur Khan Ardalani, who was at that time one of his followers. Sulaiman Khan reached Kurdistan in 1040 A. H. A year later Sultan Murad Khan IV of Turkey, who had succeeded Osman II, sent an army under Khusrau Pasha to seize Iraq- i-’Arab and Kurdistan. Khusrau Pasha went first towards Kurdistan and reached Shahrizur. Thence he sent 6 regiments of foot and 4,000 horsemen to attack Merivan and invade Kurdistan. Shah Seffi sent Zembil Khan, Sipah Salar Shamlu with a numerous army to Kurdistan and he himself led an army to Hamadan. Zembil Khan reached Merivan with great rapidity ; on hearing which Khusrau Pasha hurrried up to meet him. The battle was fought in the plain of Merivan and Zembil Khan was put to flight. The Persian army retired to Hamadan, where Shah Seffi had Zembil Khan put to death. Khusrau Pasha marched against Hamadan and, by order of Shah Seffi, the inhabitants of Kalamro ’Ali Shaker (the present Isfandabad), through who e country the Turks had to pass, all fled leaving the place a perfect desert. Khusrau Pasha, however, reached Darjesin where he remained two days, but was forced to retire towards Baghdad. Shah Seffi led the Persian army to Kurdistan and Shahrizur which he reconquered. He then helped Sulaiman Khan to reassert his authority in Kurdistan and showed him great favour. At the desire of Shah Seffi Sulaiman Khan removed his capital to the town of Senna t in 1046, and built the Government Palace and citadel on a hill in the centre of the town. He then destroyed Kaleh Zolm, Palingan, Merivan and Hasanabad, so that henceforth the Valis of Kurdistan, when in rebellion, should no longer be able to use these forts as places of refuge. In 1047 for the second time Khan Ahmad Khan with 12,000 horsemen came to devastate Kurdistan, which he entered by the Darband Chekan road. By order of Shah Seffi, ’ Ali Bali Beg Zengeneh, Amir-Akhor Bashi, with 300 men garri soned Kaleh Kurdistan or Senna, and Siavish Beg, Golar Agassi, and Shah Verdi Khan, Governor ofj Luristan and Aga Khan, chief of the Javanshiri were sent to oppose Khan Ahmad Khan. A battle was fought on the plain of Merivan. Many Pashas who accompanied Khan Ahmad Khan were killed, and Khan Ahmad Khan, seeing the weakness of his army, left the same night with his troops for Mosul, where he died six months later in 1048. His body was buried by the notables of Kurdistan near the tomb of the prophet Jonas. Sulaiman Khan remained thus unopposed ruler of Kurdistan. Shah ’Abbas the second, who succeeded Shah Seffi, always befriended him in a marked manner^ and he died in 1066 having ruled for about 20 years. * Shah ’Abbas II, 1641—1666. f Senna was formely a village or hamlet of Kurdistan and was known as Sineh; in the course ©f time Sineh became Senna.

He spent his time in pleasure and music, would listen to no advice, and did nothing to suppress the disturbances in his province, until Shah Sulaiman in 1091 A. H. listening to the people’s complaints deposed him and named in his place his uncle Khusrau Khan. He had ruled Kurdistan for nine years. Khusrau Khan, who was at that time at Merivan, repaired to Senna and Khu rauKhan 1091- 1093 sent ne ph ew in chains to Isfahan. He was a harsh A.H.

Khusrau Khan, in no way intimidated, continued oppress ing the people, and persecuted, banished or executed all who had joined in the petition. On this being reported to Shah Sulaiman, Khusrau Khan was ordered to Isfahan and executed. He had governed Kurdistan for less than two years.

(1687— Khan Ardalani, was reappointed Vali of Kurdistan, 1695 A.D.). and by order of Shah Sulaiman proceeded to Senna and thence to Shahrizur. Khan Ahmad Khan on being again ruler of Kurdistan gave himself up more even than before to pleasure and debauchery. Sulaiman Pasha Baban hearing of his mode of life raised a number of Kurds and Arabs, and in 1103 A.H. invaded Kurdistan and occupied Merivan, Avro- man and Sakiz. He had Sohrab Sultan, Governor of Sakiz, and Ibrahim Beg Mir-Iskandari, governor of Merivan, put to death. Khan Ahmad Khan marched against the invader, and Shah Sulaiman sent an army for the same purpose. The battle was fought in the plain of Merivan, and Sulaiman Pasha was put to flight leaving 4,000 of his men either killed or prisoners. After this victory ’Abbas Khan Ziadogli, at the instigation of Gassem Sultan of Avroman, who told him that Sulaiman Pasha had been invited to in. * Shah Sulaiman Sefavj, 1666—1694 A.D.vade the country by the Vali and inhabitants, had many of the notables of Kurdistan and 1,200 inhabitants imprisoned and put to death. He had a mound built of the heads of these unfortunate people, which is still visible and is known as Kalim Kuh, or the hill of skulls. Shah Sulaiman in punishment of this act of cruelty had ’Abbas Khan Sardar hanged in the maidan of Isfahan. In 1107 A.H. Shah Sultan Husain deposed Khan Ahmad Khan, and replaced him by Muhammad Khan, son of Khusrau Khan. This second governorship of Khan Ahmad Khan lasted less than nine years. In order to bring back many of the notables and people of Kurdistan, who had at u j n in tlie time of ’Abbas Khan Ziadogli fled to Turkey, iTm 4 m Shah Sultan Husain sent Husain Khan Lur Sardar d A M - Ub95 ” 17U1 to Kurdistan. This Husain Khan did much for the prosperity of Kurdistan, Ardalan, and for the ruin of Azarbaijan Kurdistan. In 1113 the Kurds rebelled against Muhammad Khan and complained to Shah Sultan Husain of his oppression. He was deposed and replaced by Mu hammad Khan Gurgi. The governorship of Muhammad Khan Ardalani had lasted six years.

One day, when leaving the town to go out hunting, he passed by the shrine of Omar ibn ’Ali, and being informed that this was the tomb of Pir Omar, he ordered it to be destroyed. On returning to the town gates he was suddenly taken ill and fell from his horse. His mother and sister hurried to his side and asked him how he was : ‘ ‘ The mother of those followers of Omar (Naneh Pir Omariah) has struck me,” said he, and then died. He had governed for less than two years, and the Shah named his brother Husain ’Ali Khan to replace him. Husain ’Ali Khan continued the religious persecution begun by his brother. A year later the inhabitants rebelled and carried their , Husain “Ali Khan, son of complaint to the Shah, who deposed the governor 1 119 ^ A HO 706 11 1707 and named Kai Khusrau Beg in his stead.

The Shah on account of the unsettled state of Persia was forced to agree to this nomina tion, and sent ’Abbas Guli Khan the firman and robe of honour of Yali. In 1128 A.H. ’Abbas Guli Khan was ordered to proceed with Kurdish troops to Kandahar to fight the Abdali Afghans. ’ Abbas Guli Khan with 8,000 horsemen left Kurdistan, but on reaching Tehran his men, seeing the disorders which prevailed, rebelled and returned to their own country. ’Abbas Guli Khan proceeded alone to meet Shah Sultan Husain and to inform him of the defection of his troops, which he attributed to ’Ali Guli Beg, grandson of Kalb ’Ali Khan Bani Ardalan, the latter of whom we have already mentioned. The Shah deposed and imprisoned ’Abbas Guli Khan, whose rule had lasted 8 years, and replaced him by ’Ali Guli Beg, to whom he sent the robe of honour and firman of Yali and the title of Khan. ’Ali Guli Khan, the grandson of Khan Ahmad Khan, was living in extreme AU Guli Khan. 1128—.132 poverty in a village of the district of Khurkhureh A.H .

His friends in adversity advised him to leave the village and try his chance elsewhere, but ’Ali Guli Beg who was discouraged always answered : “ If God wills to grant me anything he can grant it me just as well in this village of Shaikhleh” and this saying has become a proverb in Kurdistan : ‘ ‘ Agar Khuda bedehad dar karia Shaikhleh ham midehad.” ’Ali Khan, the bearer of the firman and robe of honour from the King, reached Shaikhleh notwithstanding the opposition of the inhabitants, who feared to be put to expense by his arrival and stay. He put the robe of honour on ’Ali Guli Beg, thenceforth to be known as ’Ali Guli Khan, and handed him the firman oi Vali of Kurdistan. ’Ali Guli Khan turning towards the villagers said : Didn’t I tell you that if God granted me anything he would grant it to me just as well in the village of Shaikhleh.” Luristan at that time having thrown off allegiance to the Shah, the latter sent ’Ali Guli Khan with the Kurdish army to punish the rebels. ’Ali Guli Khan gave proof of great courage and defeated the Bakhtiyaris and Burs. The Vali of Luristan after this defeat, having received promises of security from ’Ah Guli Khan, came to see him and brought him valuable presents. ’Ali Guli Khan sent him and some of the chiefs of the Bakhtiyari to the court of the Shah, who received them very kindly and allowed them to return to their country. Ali Guli Khan returned with great pomp to Senna, where he continued his governorship till 1132 A.H., when disorder prevailed and the Afghans ravaged the country on every side. Khan Pasha, son of Muhammad Pasha Baban, profited by the situation in Persia to invade Ardalan. He reached the frontier of Merivan, and being un opposed advanced up to 5 farsakhs from Senna. ’Ah Guli Khan did not wait for him but fled to Isfahan, and the inhabitants, in order to save their belongings, submitted to Khan Pasha, who declared himself Yali of Kurdi stan.Khan Pasha extended hia sway from Kerkuk to Hamadan. His subjects Khan Pasha Baban* were well satisfied with his just and equitable rule. 1132—1136 A.H.

He built a handsome mosque with tall minarets and a rmdrasseh or school, but a year after its completion it was destroyed by Amanullah Khan Buzure, who built on its site the Bagh Firdus which still exists. He remained 4 years in Senna and in 1136 A.H. placed ’Ali Khan, his son, as governor of Senna, and returned to Baban. Notwithstanding his youth ’Ali Khan spent his time in the company of ’Ali Khan t 1136—1142 ^ earne ^ men and poets. In 1142 when the iron hand A.H. (1723—1729 AD) Nadir Shah began to be felt all over Persia, ’Ali Khan quietly left the country which he had govern- e d for six years. Nadir Shah Afshar was at that time only commander-in- c hief of the troops of Shah Tahmasp the second, and was known as Tahmasp Guli Khan before he ascended the throne. On the advice of Tahmasp Guli Khan, Shah Tahmasp named ’Abbas ’4bbas OnlinOian Guli Khan Ardalan i as governor of Ardalan, but A.H. (1729 A D.) ’ Abbas Guli Kban died short l v afterwards and was succeeded by his son Sobhan Verdi Khan. Sobhan Verdi Khan was a man of great intelligence. He repaired the Sobhan Verdi Khan, 1143— tow n of Senna. When in 1147 Nadir was on 1148 A.H. (1730 -1736 his way from Isfahan to Shirvan, he passed through A.D.)

Nadir Shah, however, after his coronation in the plain of Moghanin 1148 A.H. deposed Sobhan Verdi Khan, and named in his stead his brother Mustapha Guli Khan. Sobhan Guli Khan had been governor for 5 years and 8 months. Mustapha Guli Khan was installed governor in Moharram 114$, but after 3 or 4 months the people rebelled against him, and Sobhan Verdi Khan was reappointed Vali. Winn Nadir Shah in 1153 had returned from India and marched towards the Kharazm country to puniih the Bars tribe, he appointed Sobhan Verdi Khan governor of that district. Sobhan Khan had at that time been governor of Kurdistan for a little less than 5 years and was replaced by his son Ahmad Sultan, who had followed the Shah everywhere during the journey to India, and had covered himself with glory by his great courage. ^ Nadir Shah entrusted to Ahmad Sultan all the territory from Hamadan to Khan Ahmad Khan, Mosul and gave him title of Khan.

It happened that at the same time Nadir Shah sent some one to inspect and report upon the stores of grain which had been accumulated for the Kurdistan army. Nadir’s anger at hearing that the stores were empty knew no bounds and he ordered Ahmad Khan to be put to death. Ahmad Khan, informed of the Shah’s intentions, gathered 2,000 horsemen from among his own people and left for Turkey. At Shahrizur he was opposed by Tahir Beg Ilbegi of the Jafis, whom he captured, and then marched to Sulaimanieh. Khalid Pasha, Governor of Baban submitted to Ahmad Khan, sent him large pre sents, and recognized him as Governor of Baban. Ahmad Khan, then inarched against Mosul, which he took by assault and the Governor of which place he had put to death. Having named Muhammad Chalebi Governor of Mosul he left for Diarbekr and Aleppo, and after about a month reached Constantinople. At Constantinople, he was, by order of the Sultan, met by many Pashas and notables and by the Shaikh-ul-Islam, and was accompanied with great honour to the house which had been prepared for him. He and his people were the guests of the Sultan, who shortly afterwards gave him the Governorship of Adrina, to which place Ahmad Khan and all his followers removed. Nadir Shah, at the news of the flight of Ahmad Khan, named in 1156 A.H. Haji Mau'a Verdi Khan Maula Verdi Khan Kajar, Governor of Kur- Kajar, 1156-1157 A.H. distan, and appointed Sobhan Verdi Khan, Ahmad (1742—1744 A.D.). Khan’s father, Begler Begi of Tehran. Haji Maula Verdi Khan on account of his religious intolerance was unable to keep the people quiet, and was deposed a year later and replaced by Sobhan Verdi Khan, who thus for the fourth time became Vali of Kurdistan. Sobhan Verdi Khan was given 1,000 savars or horsemen to garrison Kur- Sobhfin Verdi Khan, 1157-- distan. Their Chief, Muhammad Raza Beg, was an 1161 A. H. (1744—1748 A.D.)- impetuous and intriguing man, whose oppression of the people Sobhan Verdi Khan (through fear of Nadir Shah) was unable to stop. This went on for 3 years till 1160 A.H. when the news of Nadir’s death reached Sobhan Verdi Khan. Without saying anything to his own people he ordered Muhammad Raza Beg. and the Afghan and Khorasan notables who accompanied him, to come to see him, informed them of Nadir’s death, and advised them to leave immediately before the Kurds got to hear of the event. He gave Muhammad Raza Beg and the Afghan and Khorasan notables 1,000 tumans and ten robes of honour, and they left the country the same night. It was with great difficulty that Sobhan Verdi Khan stopped the Kurds, who on hearing the news started in pursuit. Seven months later in 1161 A.H. Ibrahim Khan, nephew of Nadir Shah&gt; who had succeeded to the throne and taken the title of ’Adil Shah, appointed Hasan ’'Ali Khan Ardalan, who had been in his service, Vali of Kurdistan. Sobhan Verdi Khan died the same year in Bamadan and was buried in the Gumbad, or domed mosque at the summit of Mount Sheidah in Kurdistan. In 1164 Kerim Khan invaded Kurdistan and sacked Senna. Hasan ’Ali Hasan ’A i Khan,* 1161 Khan shut himself up in the fort of Karataureh 1167 A.H. (1748—1753 A.D.). which was immediately surrounded by Shaikh ’Ali Khan Zend. Unable to obtain possession of the * Kerim Khan Zend, 1755—1779 A.D.fort, Shaikh’Ali Khan rejoined Kerim Khan who retired after having set fire to Senna. In 1166 ’Aii Merdan Khan, Bakhtiyari, raised a numerous army and advanced to Kirmanshah. He made a puppet of Shah Sultan Husain II who v*as in Baghdad and pretending to be a son of Shah Sultan Husain claimed the Persian throne ; his pretentions were supported by Mirza Mehdi Khan, secretary of Nadir Shah, who came to Kirmanshah. He then marched to conquer Kurdistan- At this news Hasan ’Ali Khan hurried to oppose him with his army and was joined by Kerim Khan Zend, a bitter enemy of ’Ali Merdan Khan. The battle was fought in the plain of Bilavar, and ’Ali Merdan Khan was captured as well as his camp and baggage, and Shah Sultan Husain II was killed. Hasan Ah Khan then returned to Kurdistan and Kerim Khan to Kirmanshah. ^ In 1167 A.H., when Azad Khan Afghan established his rule in Isfahan, he qv p ha 1107 AH appointed governor of Kurdistan Selim Pasha, a Turk, (1753-1754 A D ) ' ' who had taken refu g® vvith ^ and liad remained for ' 1 - • years in his camp. Hasan ’Ali was ordered to Isfahan. Two months later he obtained 4,000 tumans as a present from Selim Pasha, and sent him Hasan ’Ali Khan in chains, whom Selim Pasha had hanged on htis reaching Senna. This was the cause of the inhabitants rebelling and expelling Selim Pasha, who fled to Muhammad Hasan Khan Kajar, then all-powerful at Ashraf in Mazanderan; hoping that he would help him to regain possession of his governorship. Khusrau Khan, a son of Khan Ahmad Khan Ardalani, and for years a servant and confidant of Muhammad Hasan Khan, informed his master of Selim Pasha s crime and of his own aspirations. “ Thou knowest not Muhammad Hasan, replied the Kajar “ i am not a man to forget services rendered me and appoint a stranger to that district ” and later, “ thou knowest me not well; my word changes not, and thou art chief of Kurdistan.” Thus Khusrau Khan was appointed Vali and reached Kurdistan in Moharram 1168. He was a man of courage and intelligence, who amassed great wealth, and for over 30 years his subjects enjoy ed peace under his rule. During his first vear as Yali of Kurdistan, Azad Khan Afghan, in fear of Kerim Khan and through threats of Muhammad Hasan Khan Kajar, left Isfahan and pro ceeded towards Azarbaijan. He marched by way of Hamadan to conquer Kurdistan. It so happened that he came within two farsahhs of Senna and Khusrau Khan was obliged to retire to the citadel and send orders to collect the Kurdish troops, which were dispersed in the districts. Azad Khan remained 12 days outside Senna, but had, on the arrival of the Kurdish troops, to flee towards Azarbaijan. Khusrau Khan, leaving the town, pursued him as far as the frontier of Garrus, and forced him to leave all he had in the hands of the Kurds. Muhammad Hasan Khan Kajar, on hearing this news, sent Khusrau Khan about 3,000 tumans and valuable presents. This was the cause of great anger on the part of Kerim Khan. On the 15th Jemadi-us-Sani 1172 A.H. Muhammad Hasan Khan Kajar was murdered by Sabz ’Ali Astarabadi and Muhammad ’Ah Aga Davallu. Khusrau Khan from fear o Kerim Khan then collected his troops, and repaired the various citadels of Kurdistan, but Kerim Khan hearing of his anxiety sent him the khlat and firnum of Kurdistan, and by his kindness completely reassured him. In 1173 A.H. when Kerim Khan K 2 Khusrau Khan Buzurg, 1168-1176 A.H. (1754—1762 A.D.)84 Vakil left for Sultanieh, Khusrau Khan sent his son Ahmad Khan to him with regal presents. In 1176 A.H. Sulaiman Pasha Baban invaded Kurdistan and occupied Merivan ; Khusrau Khan with a small armv hurried to oppose him their armies met in the plain of Merivan and Sulaiman Pasha was defeated! He repaired to the court of Kerim Khan Vakil and intrigued against Khusrau Khan. Finally Khan’s 1 recalrto'sMraz.°^ t0 Keri “ Khan ’ he obtail,ed Khuarau ’ Sulaiman Pasha Baban, 1176-1177 A.H. (1762^1763 A.D.). Once Khusrau Khan was out of Kurdistan, Kerim Khan deposed him and named in his stead h.ulaiman Pasha, who a year liter was murdered by Faki Ibrahim. J A i Khan Baban, 1177— 1179 A.H. (1763—1766 A.D.). By order of Kerim Khan Sulaiman Pasha var succeeded at Suluimanieh by his brother, Muhammad Pasha, and in Kurdistan by his son ’Ali Khan. Two years later in 1179 Khusrau Khan was again Khusrau Khan Buzurg, reappointed by Kerim Khan, Vali of Kurdiston 1179—1204 A.H. (1765—1789 He repaired Senna and enlarged the government A - D ) ‘ buildings ; the part he added being to this day known as Khusruyieh. In 1193 A. H. on the death of Kerim Khan there arose many pretenders to independent sovereignty, amongst others Allah Guli Khan Zengeneh, who, gathering together on Turkish territory the Zengeneh, Kalhor and Zohab tribes ’ advanced to the conquest of Kurdistan. He was seconded by Muhammad Rashid Beg, Vakil of Kurdistan, who some time before had gone to Kirmanshah. At ithis news Khusrau Khan left Senna with a small army, and at the Gardaneh Baghan which is about 12 miles from the town, and where there is only a narrow path to pass through, he had his men counted and found that his horsemen only numbered 740. He decided then to remain where he was, and divided his men amongst his seven sons keeping only 40 horsemen for himself. He then ordered Khan Ahmad Khan, his eldest son to act as vanguard. ’ Allah Guli Khan on his side sent a thousand Zengeneh and Kurds of his followers, as vanguard, one farsakh in advance of his camp. During the night the two vanguards met and favoured by the darkness the Kurds forced the Zengenehs to retire to their camp. At dawn Khan Ahmad Khan returned to his father, and by his order gathering the greater part of the Kurdish horsemen, he attacked the enemy. As it was im possible for him to rush their guns and zambureks (camel swivel guns) he tiied a ruse and pretended to take to flight: then with two of his brothers’he turned on his pursuers and put them to flight. Allah Guli Khan was slain and beheaded All the enemy’s zambureks, camp, and baggage fell into the hands of Khusrau Khan. Muhammad Rashid Beg, Nassir Khan Kuliai and many others were taken prisoners. Muhammad Bashid Beg was forgiven and liberally treated by the Vali. who appointed Haji^ ’Ali Khan Zengeneh, uncle of Allah Guli Khan, governor of Kirmanshah. ITaji Ali Khan surrendered all his uncle’s property which was estimated at 4 crores of tumans and which Khusrau Khan had divided amongst his troops. This battle took place in Rabi-ul-Aval 1193 A.H. one month after Kerim Khan’s death.85 In 1200 A H Zaffar Khan Zend, a pretender to the throne of Persia came purposely from Isfahan to Hamadan to endeavour to attach to his cause Khusrau Khan, then one of the most powerful chiefs in Persia. Khusrau Khan consulted his people and proceeded to Hamadan at the head of his troops, and invited Muhammad Husain Khan Karagozlu the Khans of Garrus and ’ Ali Khan Khamseh, to join him 24thSh° 1 h nd ionoTw 5 :w men Et Bahar Dear Hamadan &gt; and the following dav,’ 24th Shaban 1200 A.H., the two armies met. The fight was put an end to by night KarL n0 ° n ^ e . nextda y’ A1 i Khan Khamseh and Muhammmad Husain Khan Karag ,zlu were defeated and their men dispersed. Khusrau Khan with one thousand of his men attacked Zaffar Khan, and put his army to flight. Zaffar Khan, unable to escape on account of his great stature, took refuge in the Sangar ! ry iF ar ’ and 1 the ne * td *y through the intermediary of a Hamadan mujtahid he sent all his jewelry and a Koran to Khusrau Khan begging him to allow him to escape. Khusrau Khan acceded to his request and with three of h!s own people Zaffar Khan repaired to Isfahan. Thirteen hundred Persians and Zend Lurs were killed and 800 surrendered during this battle whilst the loss on the Kurdish side was only 344 killed. ^ . ?l r&lt; ? m Hamadan Khusrau Khan marched to the conquest of Malavar ui-birkan, Rezaz, Farahan and Gulpaigan. At Gulpaigan he allowed' his men a few days rest, and it is said that whilst there asked one of his compa nions what he thought of his new kingdom. “ Oh ”! was the answer, “ our tur nips and porridge (bruised barley and wheat) are better than your kingdom ” I his set Khisrau Khan thinking, and the next day he sent the Zend prisoners and., affar Khan s jewels to Aga Muhammad Khan Kajar and recognised him as his hege lord. Aga Muhammad Khan sent him valuable gifts in return, together with the robe of honour and firman ot Kurdistan, to which province he added the districts of Sungur and Kuliai. After his accession to the throne Aga Muhammad Shah ordered Khusrau Khan to come to Tehran. These orders Khusrau Khan at first refused to obey but eventually in 1203 A.H. he proceeded to the Court of the new Shah. He had an attack of epilepsy in Tehran, and shortly afterwards became worse and com pletely lost his reason on hearing of the death of his son Khan Ahmad Kh an accidentally shot when on an expedition. In 1204 A.H. the Shah named LutfaU Khan, his uncle, Yah in place of Khusrau Khan, who died in 1206, having been Yah for 33 years. ° In 1206 A.H., Lutfali Khan set out with his army to conquer Lutfah Khan, 1204—1209 Khuzistan, and afterwards returned to Kurdistan, A.H. (1789—1794 A.D.). In 1208 A -H. the people of Khuzistan again rebelled, . and Shah sent Hassan ’Ali Khan, son of Lutfali Khan, and at that time a servant of the court of Tehran to Khuzistan to repress the rebellion. Lutfali Khan died in 1209 A.H. after six years’ governorship, and was replaced by his son who had already returned some time before to the court of Tehran from his expedition of Khuzistan. Hasan ’Ah Khan, 1209— Hasan ’Ah Khan passed his time hunting, and 1212 A.H. (1794 1797 A.D.). P ai y no attention to his affairs which were left entirely in the hands of one of his men. ^ 1211 A -H. he left with 500 horsemen for Azarbaijan, Karabagh, Shisheh and Tiflis. Sobhan Verdi Khan, a nephew of his, gathering about him the principal notables of Kurdistan, started for the court of Aga Muhammad Shah but only reached Kaleh Shisheh the day after he Shah’s assassination.Amanullah K.lian Buzurk ;* 1214—1240 A.H. (1799— 1821 A.D.). with the Bilbas tribe, and Verdi Khan, 1212 The Kurds immediately left for their homes, and A.H (7 days) (1797 A.D.). Sobhan Verdi Khan, reaching Senna a few days before Hasan ’Ali Khan, proclaimed himself Vah of Kurdistan. Seven or eight days later, however, when Hasan ’Ah Khan reached the neigh- bourhood of Senna, Sobhan Verdi Khan fled to Hasan Ah Khan, 1212— 1214 A.H. (1797-1799 A.D.). Baban. In 1212 AH three months after Fathali Shah’s accession, Sobhan Verdi Khan sent Amanullah Khan, son of Khusrau Khan, to the court of the Shah, at Tehran with a present of 20,000 tumans in gold, and a request that he should Bp qent the robe of honour and firman of Kurdistan. Amanullah Khan saw Hajji Ibrahim Khan, Sadr Azam, who advised him to give the Shah the present but to ask for the firman for himself. On account of the Shah’s journey to Khorasan matters were delayed until Saffar 1214, when Hassan ’Ali Khan was put in prison and Amanullah Khan named Vali of Kurdistan. Amanullah Khan, known as Buzurg or the Great on reaching Kurdistan set to work to quiet the country, and having got rid of all his enemies he began embellishing and im proving the government buildings. Two years later Hasan’Ali Khan escaped from prison, t)ok refuge bastnoe, ana assembling a certain number of followers invaded Kurdistan. Amanullah Khan defeated him in the plain of Menvan took him prisoner, and sent him to Tehran where he remained in prison until his death. In 1218 Amanullah Khan put to death four sons of Muhammad Rashid Beg who been the cause of numerous disorders : he thus quieted the country. man _ Khan took great interest in agriculture and bought the greater number of Kurdistan villages, where he built baths, gardens, residences, and mosques. He later on started on a second expedition against Abdul Rahman Pasha of Ba ^n, defeated the Turkish army, and devastated Shahr-i-Zor and the surrounding country as far as Baghdad. Tn 1280 A.H. the Shah as a mark of honour sent to Amanullah Khan Surur- naz Khanum a ladv of his anduran with 10,000 iumans worth of gold and jewels. Amanullah Khan gave her the name of Kabazar and admitted her to his ami y. 'anullak KhL's request the Shah gave to Khusrau Khan s son his own daughter, Khosn Jan Khanum, to whom he gave the title of Valieh. Amanullah Khan went to Teheran to receive her and displayed very great pomp, his expenses in Tehran amounting to 200,000 tumans. • Muhammad Hasan Khan, the eldest son of Amanulluh Khan, in a fit of jealousy at this news, left for Zohab with some notables, and proclaimed himself and even in the case of the chiefships of Avroman and Baneh, although the full o selection was by custom rebuked to one family, the particular individual to succeed to a vacancy was named by the Vali. T. C. Ploioden, 1881. Amanullah Khan Buzurg maintained a degree of state and splendour supenor to anything Kinneir had seen in Persia except at court. *•* At the date of Rich’s visit (1820) Aman ullah Khan, the Vali of Senna, was almost independent of the Tehran Governm nt though as a concession to the Persian Coui’t, he and the chief members of his family professed the Shiah faith. Amanullah Khan was a strong ruler, who exacted the most implicit obedience from his own children, members, and subjects. He ap pointed whom he pleased to be Governors of the different districts of Kurdistan,chief of the Kurdish tribes that spend the winter in the plain of Zohab. He raised an arm&gt; and started for Kurdistan. His father sent many of his people to cry and arrange a reconciliation but w ithout success. The matter having reached the ears of the central authorities Qaim Maqam on behalf of ’A.bbas M.rza Naib-us-Sultaneh wrote a letter to Muhammad Hassan Khan reques'hu him to desist from hss enterprise. Baba ’An Khan Shater Bashi, who had been sent specially by the Shah, had no better success, and Amanullah Khan was compelled to march against his son. The two armies met near the village of Narawi in the disrrict of Ruvansar in Kurdistan. Being still loth to fight his own son, Amanullah Khan sent Baba ’ Ali Khan, the Shah s messenger and MuUa’Abbas Shaikh-ul-Islam to endeavour to effect a reconciliation but with no success. Father and son met consequently m battle, and amongst their followers the same thing happened; fathers were pitted against their own sons uncles against their nephews. Muhammad Hasan Khan who had displayed great courage, was shot and knocked off his horse by Mirza Lutfullah and taken prisoner. Seeing their Chief wounded and prisoner his followers took to flight. Four hundred and forty men, all notables of Kurdistan fell during the battle, and 110 prisoners were put to death by order of Amanullah Khan. Muhammad Sadik Khan, another son of Amanullah Khan, who had been fighting on his father’s side, was also wounded. Amanuilah Khan had his two sons carried back to Senneh, but whilst Muhammad Sadik Khan soon recovered, Muhammad Hasan Khan only survived his defeat for a month. Ever after his son’s death Amanullah Khan’s mental faculties seemed to decline He died in 1240 A.H. having ruled over Kurdistan for 27 years, and was succeeded by his son Khusrau Khan, the Shah’s son-in-law, who was known as Nakam or the short-lived. In 1243 \H during the famine he distributed 50,000 taghars, of 45 maunds ^ tt -1 ' xiakam Tabrizi, of wheat to the people against their promise , 240 -Sa H ( “ 82 “ of payment after the famine. When the biUs for 1240 12oC A. 4 ^ purpose to the extern of 150,000 tumans were presented to him before being encashed, by Mirza Farajullah Khan Vazir, he had them all thrown into the fire. In 1246 A H. Shahzad-Beg Kurd, known as Mir of Ruvanduz devastated t Xihulak Mukri and Sardasht. Khusrau Khan collected his troops and defeated the Mir of Ruvanduz, from whom he exacted a fine of 80 000 tumans having obtained assurance of the Mir’s fature good behaviour, he returned to Kurdistan.

(1844 A.D.). The new governor treated his brother’s adherents with great severity. He had Amanullah Beg Vakil, the Pishkar of Riza Guli Khan, banished, and also banished his other followers to Sulaimanieh. Mirza Rahim Khan Pishkhidmat was sent by the government to remove Tuba Khanum from Senna to Isfandabad. This lady wrote to Mirza Agassi, Sadr Azam, who after some time promised to re instate Riza Guli Khan and to depose Amanullah Khan. Amanullah Khan’s rule lasted five months. On his return to Kurdistan Riza Guli Khan had all the persons executed who had been the cause of Amanullah Beg Vakil’s ioS Z a death, amongst whom were Jaffar Guli Khan, Bani 1262 A.H. (1844—1846 A.D). Arda | aIlj Mirza i sma il Daroga, and Mirza Ibrahim Munshi: he re-established order in his province. Two years later his enemies informing the Shah that he was a friend of Bahman Mirza, Khusrau Khan Khajjeh, a descendant of the Valis of Georgia, was sent from Tehran with the horsemen of Zein-ul-Abdin Khan Shahsayend, Sulaiman Khan Afshar, and others to seize Bahman Mirza and Riza Guli Khan. „ &lt;i Khusrau Khan left for Azarbaijan, but on hearing of Bahman Mirza’s arrival in Tehran he immediately turned towards the frontier of Kurdistan. He then informed Riza Guli Khan that he had been sent by the Shah on a special mission, and that he would be obliged by his coming to see him. Riza Guli Khan, unaware of any designs against him, went to lunch in Khusrau Khan s Khusrau Khan’s men fell on the Vail’s men and relieved them of all they had r and Riza Guli Khan was sent in chains to Tehran. Khusrau Khan Gurgi was then named governor of Kurdistan. At the news of this great injustice many of the most important people of Kurdi stan went to Tehran, where they took refuge in the Masjid-i-Shah. Haji Mirza Agassi saw his mistake, but was obliged to send a regiment and 4 guns under ’Ali Khan Karagozlu to help Khusrau Khan. He also persecuted the Kurds who had come to Tehran, hoping thus to make them This did not succeed, and it is even said that Muham mad Beg Vakil received 5,000 strokes of the stick in the Shah s presence, and yet refused to return to Kurdistan. Khusrau Khan Gurgi, 1262 —1264 A.H. (1846—1848 A.D.). abandon Riza Guli Khan. At the Shah’s death in 1264 Riza Guli Khan, who was a prisoner in the artillery park at the village of Tajrish, was against his own wish released by his people, and left for Kurdistan at the head of the Garrus regiment. ^ At this news Khusrau Khan with one regiment and 2 guns fled vid Garrus and Zinjan. Riza Guli Khan re-established quiet at the frontier. When Nasr-ud-Din Riza Guli Kh n, 1264- Shah left Tabriz for Tehran, Amanullah Khan, 1265 A.H. (1848-1849 A.D.). Riza Guli Khan’s younger brother, went to meet him at Sultanieh and Riza Guli Khan sent Muhammad ’Ali Khan Sakizzi and Allah Guli Daroga to meet him with large presents. Six months later Riza Guli Khan was deposed and replaced by his brother Amanullah Khan. 14IB L90 This was the fourth and last governorship of Kurdistan of Riza Guli Khan. He retired to Tehran and accompanied to Gurgan Muhammad Khan Sipahsalar as inspector of his troops. He was an honest and courageous man of generous disposition and did not attempt to amass money. Amanullah Khan II, known Amanullah Khan reached Senna on the 14th as G:,uiam Shah Khan, Rabi-us-Sani, 1265. 1265—1267 A.H. (1849— 1860 A.D.). Three years later he married Aftab-us-Sultan Khanum, the daughter of Husain Guli Khan, his uncle, and possessing many great qualities. Amanullah Khan n ised a ] e manent regiment of 1,0(0 men ami ap] o’nted the necessary officers. He named his younger brother, Khan Ahmad Khan, Sarhang or colonel. In 1267when the Shah went to Isfahan Amanullah Khan proceeded thither with this regiment which was warmly commended by the Shah. Towards the end of 1268 Hasan Sultan Avromani and the Shakieh tribe of Avroman rebelled. The Vali started to punish them and sent Najaf Guli Khan, son of his uncle, the late Muhammad Hasan Khan, together with Abul Gassem Yavar by the Juvanrud and Pava road, to seize Muhammad Said Sultan, brother of Hasan Sultan. His own brother Khan Ahmad Khan Sarhang went ahead by the Darbend road. The Vali defeated the rebels in the plains of Haushbadrani with trifling loss on either side. The same night Hasan Sultan with the rest of his men fled to Shahr-i-zor in Turkish territory. The Vali had all the property and houses of the rebel chiefs destroyed. Muhammad Sa’id Sultan was also defeated and Avroman occupied. Two days later came the news of the Babi rebellion and of the death of the Shah. Many of the frontier chiefs, therefore, joined the Avromanis and made a night attack upon Naj if Guli Khan. Najaf Guli Khan after a long fight retired on Javanrud to await help from the Vali Ghulam Shah Khan. On the other hand Muhammad Sa’id Sultan fled to Turkey fearing the arrival of .the Vali, who subsequently subjugated Avroman and opened negotiations for the return of the rebellious tribes ; these offered 3,000 iumins for that purpose to which the Vali agreed. A special messenger brought news of the safety of the Shah which was greeted a salute of 120 guns. In the spring of 1268 A.H. the Jaffs, who are on the Turko-Persian frontier, invaded Kurdistan and caused great destruction as far as the vicinity of Senna. The Vali was ordered to punish them and was allowed to raise 6,000 foot and horsemen, and received as reinforcements the Garrus regiment. He reached the Turiz Khatum district of the Jaffs and sent forward troops to attack the Jaffs, numbering 10,000 families, who fled leaving over 30,000 sheep behind them. The expedition lasted but 2 months and 20 days. In 1273 A.H. a certain Mirza Abdul Samad of Hamadan, a follower of Haji Muhammad Kerim Khan Kirmani of the Shaikhi sect, came to Kurdistan to try and induce the Vali to accept their tenets. In opposition to the advice of the Mullas of Kurdistan, who are Sunnis, the Vali declared himself a Shaikhi. This was the cause of disorders, and on the 16th Rabi-ul-Aval, 1273, many of the notables assembled at the cemetery outside the town, and sent word to the Vali that if Mirza Abdul Samad did not leave the91 province immediately they themselves would leave Kurdistan. The Vali refused to listen to their request, whereupon a crowd of roughs and dervishes, acting independently, crowded into the bazars and began killing and looting. At this news the Yalihad 2 guns mounted on the citadel facing the bazars which he had shelled. The mob fled, but 40 of their number were captured by the governor’s men and had their noses and ears cut off. Shaikh Abdul Kadar, a leading Mulla of Senna, left the same day for Turkey.. The Vali restored order and having settled matters according to his own wishes had Aga Mustafa, a notable of Kirmanshah, blown from a gun, and had the eyes put out of Nassim, known as Shaikh Nassim. From the town he exacted a fine of 80,000 tumans, and in less than a week the whole place was quiet again. This disturbance is known as the fight of the Caravanserai. In 1275 A.H. Nasr-ud-Din Shah came unexpectedly from Hamadan to Kurdistan, and the Vali and notables of Kurdistan hastened to meet him at Isfandabad. The Shah remained three days at Senna, then left for Azarbaijan via Garrusv As nothing had been prepared for this unexpected visit, the Vali, who was short of wheat and barley, gave the camp people money instead, which was not accepted and this was 10 months later made an excuse for deposing the Vali. Najaf Guli Khan, his nephew, who was then governor of the district of Juvanrud, cime to Senna as deputy governor. Ghulam Shah Khan left with his family for Tehran. Two months later Najaf Guli Khan received the robe of honour and firman Najaf Guli Khm, 1276- o£ Vali of Kurdistan. He was an intelligent man 1277 A.H. (1860-1861 A.D.). who treated his subjects well and generously. A year later, 1277 A.H., he§ was deposed and went to Tehran, whence he started for Azarbaijan having been named Kichikchi, or chief of the body-guard, of Muzaffar-ud-Din, Mirza Vali’ahd. He died twelve months later. Ghulam Shah Khan was re-appointed Vali, and for three years governed Amanuliah Khan II, known in peace. A number of Malias and notables of as G lulam Shah Khan, 1277— Kurdistan joined together against the Vali, and left 1284 A.H. (1861—1867 A.D.). for Tehran to complain of the oppression of the people Mirza Zeki Mustaufi, known as Nhib, was sent from Tehran as PishJcar of the Vali, and by his justice and equity the province once more became flourishing. In 1281 A.H. the Avroman tribes again rebelled and the\ ah was ordered to punish the rebels He in a short time gathered an army composed of the Zaffar Kegiment of Kurdistan, four guns, and 3,000 tufangchis and tribesmen. He sent Ah Akbar Khan Sharif-ul-Mulk to cross the Shirvan, whereupon Muhammad Sa_ id Sultan with his followers fled to Turkey, abandoning Noghud which was occupied by the Persian Army After a delay of three months Muhammad Sa id Sultan sent two chTefs to intercede for him with the Vali, who on payment of 3,000 tumans re instated him as governor of Avroman and returned to Senna. The Shah in recognition of his services sent the Vali of Kurdistan a robe» of honour and gave him the title of Zia-ul-Mulk. Towards the end of 1283 the Vali was taken seriously 111 and Dr. Tholozan* the Shah’s special physician, cured him, but three months later he had a re apse and died on the 9th Jemadi-us-Sani 1284 A.H. Amanuliah Khan was born at court of a daughter of Fath ’Ah Shah. Sho ’' tl &gt;’' after his birth the Shah had his ears pierced and a gold ring put on, and called him his ghulam or slave, and ever since Amanuliah Khan was known as Ghulam.Shall Khan He was an enlightened and well educated man and governed Kurd istan for nearly 20 years.* The mosque of Dar-ul-Aman m Senna was built by him, and he also erected many residences and laid down gardens. He collected 2,000 volumes in his library and bought 50 villages, but at the time of his death owed 80,000 tumans. At Amanullah Khan’s death Mirza Zeki Vazir proposed that he should be succeeded by his son Khan Khanan, but this did not meet with the approval of the Shah who ngfmed Prince Farhad Mirza, Mu’tamad-ud-Dauleh his own uncle Governor of Kurdistan. Thus ended the sway of the Valis of Kurdistan which thenceforth was ruled by provincial Governors. Provintcial Governors. Farhad Mirza Mu’tamad-ud-Dauleh, first Governor of Kurdistan expressed h s Farhad Mirza MuW-ud- intentions in replying to the congratulations of the I)'uleh 1284-1291 A.H. notables I am governor of this province, I never (1 868—74 4 D.). tell an untruth, and none of you must tell untruths to me. Should any one do so he will be executed.”^ Daring the six years of his governorship truth was said to be “ Bazar-Currency. I Whilst on a journey to Merivan, Farhad Mirza was met by Hasan Sultan, his two brothers/ and a thousand men. Hasan Sultan had for two years been in rebellion against the Vali of Kurdistan. He was, by order of Farhad Mirza, invited to take coffee in a cofiee house, was seized, and hanged, and his two brothers put in chains. *T. C. Plowden in 1881 wrote Ghulam Shah Khan was the last Vali of Senna of the house of Ardalan. His father married a daughter of Path ’Ali Shah, a princess of a very vigorous and determined character. She was the virtual ruler of Kurdistan, and administered the affairs of the pro vince in open darbar. Her son. Ghulam bhah Khan, died about 20 years ago, leaving a brother, Riza Guli Khan, and three children, sons. These were all set aside, and Mu’tamad-ud-Dauleh, the present Shah’s uncle, was appointed the first Hakim of Kurdistan. It does not appear that the people made any objection to the change of ruler. Rich points out that the peasantry of Persian Kurdistan are not clansmen, and not animated by that love for, and devotion to, their princes which marked the relations between the chief of Sulai- manieh and his tribesmen. The Valis of Senna were, moreover, a cruel and rapa cious race deserving little sympathy, and p ;obably their people were not sorry to be rid of them. 'However this may be, the subjec tion of the chief of Avroman appears to have been the principal difficulty with which Mu’tamad-ud-Dauleh had to contend. Hie details of the struggle belong to the gener il history of Persia, and it is sufficient here to mention that eventually Avromm was brought under control, and its two divisions are now governed, the upper by Div vn-Be: i, Mirza Arzu ’Ali, the son, and the lower by ’Abbas Guli Beg, the brother of Hassan Khan, the last of the Sultans of Avroman. Mu’tamad-ud-Dauleh administered the province for nine years, and has been fol lowed by a succession of Persian Governors. The ancient family of Bani Ardalan has been reduced to poverty and insignificance. The three sous of Gh dim Shah Khan re side at Senna, but they have squandered their money and sold their immense estates ; and they have now little else to live on than the allowance assigned them by the Persian Government. One of the family is Sharif-ul-Mulk, Hakim of Ardabil in Azarbaijan, and is well off, but he owes his position and wealth to the patronage^ of the Kajars. Another, Muhammad Ali Khan, son of Riza Guli Khan, and couse- quentlv nephew of Ghulam Shah Khan, is Sartip of the Faaj-i-Kurdistan, or Kurd istan regiment of infantry. He is a thorough Persian.”93 At sight of this, his escort of a thousand men fled and Farhad Mirza return ed to Senna. The Avromani tribes remained quiet for a time, but their efforts to obtain the release of their chiefs being fruitless, they decided to seize Muham nad Bagher Khan who had been sent to Merivan to repair the fort and detain him as a hostage. At this news Farhad Mirza in 1286 marched against the Avromanis, but was defeated. Subsequently, however, he was successful and the Avromanis fled £Q Shahr-i-zor. They remained in Turkey for a year, but the chiefs came back one by one and were pirdoned by the prince, who reinstated Muhammad Sa id 8ultanas governor of Avroman, but afterwards caused him to be treacherously murdered with his son and all his family by ’Ali Akbar Khan Sharaf-ul-Mulk. Ma’tamad-ud-Dauleh did three great things during his governorship. Firstly, he subdued the Auramis, whose depredations extended from Shahr-i-zor in Turkey to the vicinity of Senna, a task randerel very diflicult by the constant help the Auramis got from the Turks whenever the Persians undertook any expedi tion against them. Secondly, he forced the Jaffsto quit Persian territory. This tribe which num bers over 12,000 families camps in Turkey in winter and autumn, and in spring and summer occupied the Kurdistan mountains extending up to Sminn. Phey onlv paid a very small sum for pasturage._ This lawless and marauding tribe an art from plundering the unfortunate inhabitants, destroyed the most important vill age of the districts they overran ; and built villages of their own, shedding the blood of the settlers without remorse. The prince told them to choose between Persia and Turkey, and by garrison ing the frontier successfully stopped their incursions. Thirdly, he abolished the house-tax in Senna which varied from 2 to lo brans p 3 r house ; and substituted iron weights in the bazars for stones and peb bles then in use. He fixed the maund at 900 miscals. 0 Towards the end of 1287 cholera broke out and lasted three months, and in the bemnnino' of 1288 famine began to be felt all over Persia. The price of wheat rose from 2 to 12 tumans thskharvar. It is estimated that 3,000 people died from chalera or famine. Duriim the spring of 1289 the famine came to an end, and the sa ne year Nasr-ud-Dm Shah intending to leave for Europe called Farhad Mirza to Tehran to act as regent. » Mu’tamad-ud-Dauleh left his son Abdul’Ali Mirza Ihtisham-ul-Mulk as deputy governor of Kurdistan. On the Shah’s return from Europe, Mu’tamad-ud-Dauleh wentba,ck to Kur distan. and six months later was dismissed and replaced by Tahmasp Mirza Mu ay- yid-ud-Dauleh who was already governor of Kirmanshah. Mu’ayyid-ud-Dauleh was a generous man, and instead of forcing the inhabit ants to contribute towards his expenses is said to have Tahmasp Mirza Mu’ayyid- g t 12&gt; 000 tumans on his journey to Kurdistan. ud-Dau eh, 1291-1292 A.II. ^ left ’ ^ son Muhammad Mehdi Mirza deputy (1874-1875 A.D.). governor for Kurdistan and returned to Kirmanshah. Disorders soon prevailed, roads were unsafe, and fighting was universal, and final ly the mob tried to invade the palace.94 Mu’ayyid-ud-D iuleh and his son therefore were dismissed and Imam Guli Mirza, Imad-ud-Dauleh, was appointed governor of Kirmanshah and Kurdistan. Emad-ud-Dauleh named his son, Hashmat-ud-Dauleh, deputy governor of Imam Guli Mirza Emad- Kurdistan. He was three or four months later called ud-Dauleh and his son Hesh- father’s death-bed and succeeded him as gover- mut-ud-Da deh. 1292-1293 nor. He left Sharaf-ul-Mulk to govern Kurdistan A.H.

Towards the end of 1293 the governorships of Kirmanshah and Kurdistan Sultan Murad Mirza Hu- were given to Sultan Murad Mirza Husam-us-Sul- sam-us-SuItaneh and his son. taneh. Husam-us-Sultaneh named Shihab-ul-Muik deputy governor, but dismissed him shortly after wards, and named in his stead his own son, Abdul Fazl Mirza Mu’ayyid-ud- -Dauleh*. During the Shaikh Obeidullah troubles, Sharaf-ul-Mulk, grandson of Amanul- Abul Tarf Mirza Mu’ayyid- lah Khan Buzurg, informed the Shah that should he ud-Dau!eh, 1293—1299 A.H. and his family be restored to favour, he would wi h (1877—1882 A.D.). the Kurdistan troops alone seize the Shaikh. Nasr-ud- Din named him governor of Kurdistan, but cancelled his nomination on accmnt of local opposition, and Sharaf-ul-Mulk soon afterwards accompanied Muhammad Rahim Khan’Ala-ud-Dauleh to Azerbaijan and was appointed governor of Ardabil. In 1299 Kurdistan was taken away from Mu’ayyid-ud-Dauleh and added to Mahmud Khan Nasr-ul- the lar g e governorship of Zill-us Sultan who appointed Mulk 1299-1300 AH. (1882- Mahmud Khan Nasr-ul-Mulk governor ol Kirman- 1883 A.D.) for Zil-Sultan. shah and Kurdistan. Nasr-ul-Mulk left all the affairs of Kurdistan in the hands of Mushir-ud-Divan’ Mirza Ahmed Khan Iqbal- against whom the Mullas and notables of Senna ul-Mulk, 1300 1302 A H. made numerous complaints to Zill-us-bultan with the (1883—1885 A.D.) for Zil-es- result that Mirza Ahmad Khan Iqbal-ul-Mulk, son Sultan. of Mirza Baba Hakim Bashi, was appointed governor of Kurdistan. During his governorship a fearful feud broke out between the Kalbaghi and Tilehkuh tribes through a Kalbaghi woman having been assaulted by a Tilehkuhi. * Of him T. C. Plowden in 1881 wrote :— “ The present Governor of Sennah is Abul Fazl Mirza, son of the Husam-us-Sultaneh and son-in-law of the present Shah. He is not a little proud of his high connections, and likes to affect royal manners and gener ally to play the prince. He looks for ward to the time when Turkey will be weak enough for Persia to risk a war, or when Persia might, through the interven tion of some other Power, obtain the territory of Iraq which Persians so dearly C °Hi t s highness does not trouble much about the condition of the province over which he rules. The administration is carried on by the Vazir, who has himself farmed the revenue. The amount to be collected is nominally fixed at 60,000 tumans: of this sum 25,000 tumans are retained for local expenses and the balance remitted to Tehran. But, as the Vazir has to make his own profit, and also to pay a yearly pish-kesh to the Governor of no less than 10,000 tumans, it is evident that the exactions from the people must con siderably exceed the nominal assessment of the province.”95 The Tilehkuhis fled to Sujbulak and only returned on the Kalbaghi being punished and paying compensation. In 1302 Zill-us-Sultan dismissed Iqbal-ul-Mulk and named Ibrahim Mirza Ibrahim Mirza Ihtisham- Ihtisham-us Sultaneh governor^ of Kurdistan. us-Sultaneh, 1302-1303 A.H.

He then had a few hands and heads cut off and punished some of the frontier chiefs, and for two months Kurdistan was governed as it had not been governed for long.

During the time of their stay in Persia not only do the Jaffs import and export all their goods and produce without paying customs duty, but they also help Ottoman subjects to import merchandise, specially prohibited goods, such as arms and ammunition and aniline dyes, without paying duty.

S 2148 KAR-KAR KARAJIAN— Elev. 5,280'. Is situated in the valley of the same name 4 miles north of Ruvansar. Here diverge roads to Kirmanshah vid Ruvansar, to Javanrud and to Kamiaran. The Karajian valley is here a mile broad ; the mountains steep and grassy, but bare of trees. The valley itself contains much grass. A few patches of cultivation lie round the village. There is no water when the snow has melted off the surrounding hills, and the village is deserted during the summer by the inhabi tants, who leave for the Zarna mountain with their flocks and herds.— (Burton.) KARAJIAN (pass and valley)—Elev. 6,340'. Is traversed by the Senna-Javanrud road between the village of Lun and the Gashen pass. The descent into the valley from the direction of Lun is steep and dangerous for laden animals for a short distance, but the remainder of the valley is traversed by good and level tracks. The length of the valley to Ruvansar is about 9 miles. As far down as Karajian it is a mile only in width, gradually expanding as it nears Ruvansar. In this portion it is flanked on either hand by rocky and splintered cliffs of the Shahu and Zarna mountains. Grass is abundant throughout, but there is no water after the melting of the snow. At Karajian the Javanrud road diverges to cross the Shahu range by the Gashen pass to the west, which it does by a steep and difficult track to Khani-Khadran on the Halab- jeh-Kirmanshah road, the road continuing to Ruvansar; here also from the east side joins road from Kamiaran.—(R^rtoM.) KARAVUL— A village to the left of the Senna-Sakiz road at 2 farsaJchs from Senna.— (Customs.) KARASU— A river in south-west Persia which rises in Kurdistan ; its principal stream ori ginates at Ruvansar, where numerous springs pour out a considerable volume of clear water from some rocky hills on the porth-west border of the village. Two other small tributaries join it east and north-west of the same village on the fertile plain of Shahabad, 30 miles north-west of Kirmanshah city ; it receives additional water from numerous tributaries ; a little lower down it is joined by the Ab-i-Merek, which, rising in the Luristan hills, flows through the Mahidasht plain. A few miles further down it is joined by various streams from a place called Sarab- Nilufar, al out 5 miles w^est of its right bank. The river at this early part of its course flov s at a considerable distance below the level of the surrounding country, at least 10 and often from 15 to 20 feet below it. In consequence of this its waters are not used for irrigation purposes below Uramuvar (Urumabad) about 8 miles from its source. The country through which it passes is exceedingly * fertile, while the banks of the river are lined, in many places for several miles together, with willow trees and bushes. Ten miles north-west of Kirmanshah city the Rizavar-rud, from the Bilavar valley, coming down rid Kaklistan, joins it. Its waters are now more or less discoloured. There appears to be no reason why its waters should not be utilized lor irrigation, at any rate as far as ’ Kirmanshali ; the probable explanation is the disinclination of the Persian to expend money in masonry dams, and his incapacity to construct them, and also owing to a legend which declares that the river cannot be used for ' irrigation purposes. It is joined at a spob about 15 miles south-east of Kirmanshah by the Gamasiab. The united rivers then flow south-west, through Cham-Nuzeh, Gudapur, Tang-i-Tir, and Huleilan to Seimerreh, when they join and help to make the main stream of the Karkhah.— (Plowden ; Vaughu.i.) .KAK-KAS 149 KARATAUREH (Kalatarzan)— n A village of the district of Kalatarzan .—(Gorvernment list.)
