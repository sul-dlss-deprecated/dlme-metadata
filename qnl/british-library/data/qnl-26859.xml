I understand fren Gracey that inany of the best paratroopers in our forces, includinc those v/’io fought at ArnUan, .verr-^ Ac: j they are indeed splendid, soldierly natenai. , On the other hand, it doed scan to r.e that,- as i^art of our future military reorganisation, v/e need comet unu in the nature of a Iliddle Eastern Foreign Legion to relieve the strain on recruiting for such permanent overseas amy as x;e all have to maintain in ’the future. For such a Legion wo shall have e::cellent material in dissident foies, Yugoslavs, and others and not least among the Winston raised the joint in Cabinet not long ago and I believe, as with the French, such a iorce would be an invaluable ele ’.ent in our whole ovex’seas defence s nton. Now that system v.ill, I believe, hove to be based on maintaining strategic reserves at certaib .bints from which they can be quickly shipped or flown to possible centres of disturance.

Mr. Patrick has suggested that Abyssinia - being a (Coptic) Christian country - might be prepared to take the Assyrians with whom I believe they have much in common. If the attempts to accommodate them in the Lebanon, Bitrea or Cyrenaica fail, this proposal might well be taken further. Mr. Patrick . Would you care to pass on with your remarks re Abyssinia? through the League of Nations and place after place was tried before this refuge was found. It says little for our faith in the toleration of these Arab States admitted to San Francisco, if they can't be relied on to look after their Christian minorities.

(Initialled) P.J.P. 23rd July, 19&lt;±5.I was dining recently with Bishop Mathew, auxiliary to the Archbishop of Westminster, who has just come back from a mission on behalf of the Holy See to secure educational and religious facilities from the Ethopian Government for Italians who have remained in Abyssinia. Bishop Mathew told me how co-operative he found the Emperor, though he admitted that conditions in the country were somewhat primitive for Europeans. Knowing his interest in the ancient Christian sects of the Middle East, I told him that the Assyrians, settled in Syria, were now something of a problem and asked what in his opinion were the prospects of settling 'them in Abyssinia. The Bishop thought that the idea was good in urinciple. He said that the Emperor and his Government are Asiatics with an interest and respect for Christians of the Asian continent. The country, he said, was sparsely populated and could without*difficulty absorb new colonists. The Church is reasonably tolerant of other Christian bodies provided that they show its dignitaries and relics proper respect. In any case there is plenty of work for industrious people ready to live on a simple scale. But the Emperor is at the moment suspicious/ a.iwrr 2 . suspicious of British intentions and allergic to any hint of trusteeship or inteference. While he would, the Bishop thought, perioaps not he unready to allow entry to and proviae land for Assyrian colonists, he would have the strongest objection to admitting them as British protected persons, with a special claim to British protection. They would have to merge with the general population and become the Emperor's subjects, even if they were started off with a generous subvention from British revenues.

Northern Baluchistan is inhabited exclusively by Fathans who are’ Sunni Moslems of Hanafi persuasion and inclined to fanaticism. It is out of the question to consider the establishment of a Christian Colony in their midst and apart from practical difficulties, any attempt to do so would stir up intense political resentment which would not be confined to Baluchistan and probably not to Moslem opinion in India -alone, Hanaf is' of Northern India have always revered Qllani shrine in Baghdad* which might well become centre of inspired resistance to any such move. Apart from above nearly all cultivable land in Baluchistan has already been taken, up and prospects of expansion of irrigation are very small- Population of Baluchistan decreased between 1931 and 1941 and it is most unpromising area for colonisation It is true that pressure of population on area is smaller than in any other part of. India, but if any colonisation were practicable it would be necessary to consider it with a view to relief of population pressure in India and not from outside. Remaining parts of Baluchistan inhabited by Baluch and Brahui tribes are in Kalat and feudatory States and consist almost entirely of (?ryots). General political objections mentioned in the case of Pathans apply here also in almost equal degree, while Terrain is even more inhospitable and could not in any circumstance permit of colonisation. On all grounds I consider proposal entirely impracticable.■R r i ^ DEPTL.

The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum (C.P. (45) 11) OF TEE by the S/S for Foreign Affairs inviting the Cabinet to ASSYRIANS, consider v/hether our future xjolicy should be based on the assumption that the Assyrians now in Iraq and Syria would d have to remain where they are or whether a determined attempt should now be made to settle them outside the Middle East. THE S/S FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said that the first alternative - that the Assyrians in Iraq and Syria shquld remain v/here they v/ere - was not a satisfactory solution, given the risk to v/hich they would be exposed of future conflicts with the Muslims m Iraq. On the other hand, the experience of the past ten years had shown the difficulty of finding a new home fbr the Assyrians outside the Middle East. The Dominion Governments were not prepared to accept them, and the difficulties of settlement m the Colonial Empire v/ould also be very grave. We were, however, under great obligation to the Assyrians and he felt that we shout! make a further effort to find a home for them. In discussions the following points v/ere made:- (a) THE S/S FOR THE COLONIES confirmed that there was no prospect of finding a home for the Assyrians in any of the Colonies. (t)) THE S/S FOR INDIA suggested that it might he possibld to accommodate them in Northern Baluchistan. It was suggested that there might be difficulty in settling a Christian community among the Muslims of Baluchistan. (c) It was suggested that, despite the objection v/hich Lord Moyne had previously seen to the settlement of the Assyrians in the conquered Italian colonies, further consideration might be given to the possibility of settling them in Eritrea or Cyrenaica. It was of particular import ance that we should establish our influence in Cyrenaica; and it would be useful if the Assyrians could be employed there as guards for British airfields and allowed to found a settlement for their families in the neighbourhood of the airfields. They had proved their worth as levies; I * I and their employment in this capacity might warrant their being given a neighbouring area in v/hich to found a settlement. Such an arrangement might, however, cause trouble with the Sennusi; and this point would need to be watched. (d) THE S/S FOR INDIA also suggested that the Assyrians might be settled in the Lebanon, where a Christian community would be more welcome. Such a settlement might well be politically attractive to the Lebanese, though possibly unwelcome to the Assyrians. |J THE CABINET: (1) Invited the S/S for Foreign Affairs to ascertain the view of the Minister Resident, Middle East, and the Minister in the Levant States on the possibilities of settling theAssyrians in Eritrea, Cyrenaica or the Lebanon. (2) Asked the S/S for India to ascertain the views of the Government of India on the possibility of settling the Assyrians in Baluchistan.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000602.0x0001a2_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/2876</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000602.0x0001a2</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/2876</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 17/16(5)(S) 'Settlement of the Assyrians'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1945/1945</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-09-19T09:02:42</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (14 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in rough chronological order from the rear to the front of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 15; these numbers are written in pencil and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.
