His Majesty’s Consul,Kerman, has now asked me to sanction an increase in the pay of the Kerman &lt;and Yezd menial establishments so as to bring them on to the at same level as the Bandar Abbas menials. 2. The present scale of gay of the menial establish ment of Kerman and Yezd“is fe.40-2~5C inpluding dearness allowance. The minimum pay of newly joined Persian Grbvt. farash at'these places is Rials. 1,000/“ per month plus bonus of one month* s at Nauroz while commercial f inns menials receive Rials r,l3Q/- per month. It will be observed there fore that the menials employed in other departments draw more than double the pay of the menials of/tne Kerman and Yezd Consulates and even witn the proposed scale their emoluments will still be well below local wage ratesi The.Govt. of iu kA India is aware of the very high cost of living in Persian 1 and that there has'been a further marked increase in the of living during the first six months of the year.

Two of the incumbents of this post resigned in the brief period of two years prior to January 1945, and since the issue of this Residency’s letter referred to above nother incumbent of that post has also resigned. It is clearly becoming impossible to recruit the right type of man for Kuwait and to retain bim after recruitment on the present low rates cf P&amp;y- 4. For the above reasons, and for others which will occur to the Government of India, I strongly recommend that the Government of India reconsider their decision and pass orders for the up-grading of the third post of First interpreter.

Allowances of Rs.200 per mensem in respect of medical services and Rs *350 P® r annum for medicines was sanctioned (P. 4534/21 and F. 5176/21 flagged in attached volume) • The papers referred to by the Political Resident do not appear to have been received in this Department. Possibly the Government of India decided to halve the monthly allowance to the C.M.S* or more likely, the Rs.100 given in the Politic ad Residents letter is due to a typing error. 2r** ft Copy of an express letter No. 1318-47/18 dated the 2nd August 1943, from the Hon'hie the political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire to Foreign, New Delhi.

Mission at Kerman are at present being paid a monthly allowance of Rs. 100/- for medical attendance on His Majesty's consul, Kerman and his staff. The c.M&gt;S. applied in September 1942 for the allowance to be increased to Rials 3.500 (equivalent to Bs.355/- at the present rate of exchange) per mensem with effect from September 1942 for the reasons stated in Consul, Kerman's letter under reference. 3. flie delay in addressing the Government of India on this subject has been occasioned solely by consul Kerman's and my own unsuccessful efforts to persuade the c*M. S&gt; to accept an allowance less than Rials 3,500 per mensem, if the Government of India 4o not agree to the Mission's request the medical services now rendered by them will be withdrawn and it will be necessary to incur the following monthly expenditure at Kerman —i t 12 9 £fi jpaistanV- «SC£/ Veo I 11 -12-194$ • • • • • • • • • •Assistant Sur^eontBritish Cadre) •• /^Compounder .• •• Peon •• •• •• •• Drugs Dearn»ess Allowance to Staff approximately Pay Es. 600/- • fe. 80/- • &amp;.

The Office Allowance of the Consulate at Kennan will have to be increased by a sum of Rs.3.000/- per annum and this amount/ will,as far as oossible, be met by reappropriation. * A v* A- 5.

Sir, I am directed to address you on the subject of grant of dearness allowance to the clerical establishment under the Persian Gulf Residency. ♦ 2, The Hon'bl® the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf repr sented that the cost of living in the Persian Gulf and Iran had increased tremendously on account of the conditions created by the war and the grant of relief, by way of a dearness allowance, to the clerical establishment was a matter of urgent necessity. Also that it was difficult for him to find personnel for the temporary war appointments on the existing emoluments and that some of the permanent staff had resigned and it was difficult for him to retain the others unless relief was gran ted immediately. On the basis of the comparative statement, furnished by the Political Resident, of prices of essential articles of consumption at the commencement of the war and in the autumn of last year, at the various pi?oes at which the staff are stationed, the percentage increases in cost of living per head over that in 1939 worka out to be about 150 to 260 . The Political Resident also reported that Foreign Office had sanctioned liberal rates of dearness allowance (at 1705 b since June 1942 and at 20CJC since February 1943 for Munshis) for the KaT.2969/43 /lowlow paid staff in Iran with effect from Jupe 1942.

For following reasons I am doubtful of the desirability of separating BANDAR ABBAS from KESHAN: (a) BANDAR ABBAS is port of KE’PMAN and is administered by Covemor-^eneral of Kerman. (b) BANDAR ABBAS and SBISTA^T are both under GOO EETOiAK who fre&lt;fuentl r discusses military problems of that area. (o) The Consul at KERKAN can easily get down to BANDAR ABBAS in two days. I myself plan to go there in Deceiiber or early January. /(d)(d) Vice-Consul wuld presTjciably be (? g*o.) some recess in sinner. 'oat suitable place for recess '.touIc! be KER’iAK• (e) Both posts have Joint accounts and single treasury which would be Tnfd.ntained with minimum of adjustment. Suggest for consideration that WIGROLSOI'I should retain designation of Vice-Consul KERMAN which is presumably /slid for whole consular area including BANDAR ABBAS (see para 8 of FALCONER 1 s letter 34 dated ?th February 1942). This would not prevent him from living at BAfTDAH ABBAS for greater part of the year and would enable him to function also in KERMAN if convenient at any time* Even is his area were extended to include e.g. LXVSAH I doubt if it would be necessary to amend his Exequatur in view of the fluidity of Persian administrative organisation in that area* 3 .

The reason for the revival of the post is for Gulf work, including shipping, naval and even navicerts and of course intelligence. There are disadvantages in divided control, and past practice has been that posts in Gulf ports should be superintended from BUSHIRE. 3. With regard to BARLOW * s points (a) to (e), the position as between SHIRAZ and BUSIIIRE provides some analogy and recess in KERMAN would always be possible during which if required the Vice- Consul could assist with the Kerman work. The division of Treasury will not, in PRIOR’s opinion, cause any difficulty. 4 . The Government of India, therefore, advise that the post be designated as Vice-Consul at BANDAR ABBAS, and be superintended from BUSHIRE with recess in KERMAN. From: TEHRAN No. 579 Date: 2/12/1*2.

EbrtJflM/U- Bxt.4B77/W. In 1933 the consular districts of Kerman and Bandar Abbas \7ere amalgamated for reasons of cconany. A Consular Office v/as established at Bandar Abbas and the Consul at Keman was to sy^end some months in the year there. In June, 1941, the Coverment of India suggested tiie re-opening, with officers from India, of certain Vice- Consulates in Persia, among them Bandar Abbas, and invited the views of the Political Resident and His Majesty’s .Minister, Tehran. The Political Resident replied that in his opinion the ’’re-opening of a Vice-Consulate at Bandar Abbas is fully justified by extra work entailed in i T avy Certificate system'’. His Majesty’s Minister, however, said that 'His Majesty’s Consul at Kerman holds that the re-opening of the Vice-Consulate at B;indar Abbas would not be justified either by economic warfare work or by political advantages” and suggested that a Vice-Consul should be appointed at Kenan who could be detached for periods of duty at Bandar ibbas, which would have the advantage of not requiring the agreement of the Persian Government. The Government of India, therefore, when they put their proposals to His Majesty’s Government, suggested ’’one officer as assistant to Consul, Kerf nan, agrement as Vice-Consul being sought later. This would cover Bandar Abbas”. This proposal was sanctioned. A reccrriendation by the Government of India that the Vice-Consul, Kerman, should be paid on the tine scale of the Indian Political Service with various allowances was sanctioned in December. In July this year His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, in a telegram to the Foreign Office stated ’’now that R.A.F. / aerodromes Ext.7433/41.aerodromes tire 'being made in South East Persia we used a Vice-Consul for Bandar Abbas ’ • The Govemxaent of India have nor: telegraphed proposing to revive the post of Vice-Consul, Bandar Abbas, on the same terms as before, to be superintended from Bushire with recess in Kerman* His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, lias agreed to the proposal and consider® that direct superintendence from Busliire might be an advantage so far as shipping matters are concerned. -'he Government of..India propose that the post of Vice-Consul, 'er ’-an, should be abolished, the present incumbent, Lieutenant P.F.G-. Nicholson, being sent to Bandar Abbas. They, are sectioning the post of Extra Assistant, Kerman, presumably under the present arrangement by which His Majesty’s Govemnent and the Governaent of India can each sanction expenditure up to £1,000 without reference to the other. The .Government of India's x^posal does not appear to, ^ , involve the sanctioning of any expenditure by His ila^esty’ s Government.* It is suggested that subject to the views of the Foreign Office this proposal might be approved.

Vice Consulates Iran. 2. Proposals that follow arise from the fact that we must anticipate demands in future from military authorities for trained officers for service in these areas. If we are to be in the position to lend qualified officers with experience of current affairs it is essential that we should plan at once to jlace as many officers in training as cadre limitations, financial implications and Iranian suspicions will permit. V/e recognise that actual volume of existing work does not justify all the appointments but considerations stated above must outweigh this factor. We hope to reduce possible difficulties (?with) Iranian Government by only filling posts already (7 recognised) or by creating posts not requiring recognition. 3. After consulting representatives concerned and with full support of the General Staff Government of India make the following definite proposals for placing Indian Political Service Officers in I r an. (a) One officer as Assistant to Consul, Kerman, agrdment as Vice-Consul being sought later.

Kerman No. - 3 3 3 Your telegram No. 180 (telegram No.3122 to India Office). His Majesty’s Consul at Kerman holds that the re-opening of the Vice Consulate at Bandar Abbas would not be justified either by economic warfare work or by political advantages. He suggests, however, appointment of a Vice Consul at Kerman who could act for him ( r :gp. omitted: and who) could be detached for periods of duty at Bandar Abbas concession (sic).
