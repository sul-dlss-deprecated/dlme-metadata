The estimated cost of the work was £23.060 (P,W,828A3).but the actual total cost has not yet been ascer tained. Oo the 28th January, 1916, the work had been completed except for a short section of 36 miles from Shuster to Disful at a cost, as reported * the Director at Teheran but subject to audit, of £22,121 (P.W.1432A5). The Section from Shust»r to Disful was completed on the 28th Kovember 1918. BY the terms of the Agreement £5,000 was to be deducted from the total cost of the work as a grant to Persia in return for the renewal up to the 1st January, 1945, of the Conventions (1) of the 2nd April, 1368, (Gwadur-Jask line) (2) of the 2nd December, 1872, (Teheran-Bushire line) and (3) 16th August 1901, (Central Persia line). If the actual cost of the work is found to be as estimated, the balance outstanding after this deduction has been made, vis. £18,060, constitutes the debt due from the Persian Government. It was also agreed that from the date of commencement of the work and up to the 1st1 94 5 . the date of termination of the Agreement an annuli oontribution of £300 should be paid to the Persian Government for the maintenance of the line.
