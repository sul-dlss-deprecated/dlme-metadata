The Shaikh stated that he knew the late Begum very well and also her eldest son with whom he had been on shooting trips in India and with whom he had stayed for'a number of days, Neither the Shaikh or I know if the present ruler is the Begum’s eldest son ; The Shaikh said that he would arrange for an ’’istiqbal' but I do not think he proposes to meet the Nawab himself. I should be grateful if you would keep in touch with the Shaikh in the matter and doubtless you will meed; the Nawab yourself. 0 C.

POLITICAL AGENCY, BAHRAIN, Dated 4th October, 1948 Dear Colonel Galloway, £ f Please refer to your S.0.No.(120/2/48), dated the 18th September, 1948, about the Nawab of Bhopal’s passing through Bahrain. I did ask Parker to let me know when he was due, but he rung me up a few days’ ago* to say that he appeared to have slipped through his office’s hands. On the morning he rung up he said that a ’’Nawab Jung Bahadur and Begum” had passed through. I assume that this was Bhopal and I am sorry not to have met him and to have teen unatle to inform the Shaikh. Yours sincerely, His Excellency Lt. Col. A.C.
