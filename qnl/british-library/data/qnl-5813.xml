My work is much simplified thereby. I am sending my Pathan, Ibrahim Khan, back to Koweit in this ship. He has developed a tumour in the neck. Dr. Harrison has very kindly undertakflm to remove it. I asked Harrison if he could arrange for keeping Ibrahim Khan while the wound was healing up. He replied that it would be more convenient if I.K. could stay with your crowd. Could you let him do this. He will of course arrange for his own grub kc. Further, there is the question of three coffee pots. If they are a nuisance, let them rest until I next wander to Koweit. If they are not a nuisance, I.K. could accom pany them to Bushire. Again thanking you. ^ wn-Political Agency, Kuwait, 16th September 1912. 2 -&gt; Dear Harrison, Just got your note and am sending my Mullah over to arrange for the burial of Ibrahim Khan, and with in structions after he has hurried him to take over from you any of the dead man's kit, keys, money etc there may be on him or with you. If you will send me over a formal death certifi- oate as well, I will settle his affairs and let Townshend know. You might also write privately to Townshend.

In -e^ly to your looter of June 19th- (received SOtli) t i In connection with Sha^eBpear.’s deatir,, I Bend herewith the Q-oatements of:- (1) Aod^ul-Aclc bin Kasun, our oaael Jemadar,, ( 3 ) Kadi, camelimn, on whoee account, cy former report was chiefly based,, and,, (3) Ambush, who is referred to both aB butler and body- -servant. Also a list of the 00 vt, and private servants who were actually with. Ohaiiespear on. the day of the fight. The important point, in question, seemsto be whether he went among the troops, or ascended a mound to photograph the proceedings, or possibly did first one and tlieni the other, and it is not easa to come to a. definite conclusion-. Presumably the Arabs, speaking generally, would prefer oo j.ep.i.e*' -cent him as having been, entirely responsible for his own. death in order to lessen the ohanceof our taiving up the master, and thougli I do not think Mubarak xB with them, tlie stateaento of ou: .nay perhaps be framed accordingly:, but if we take the view that he was billed on a. point of vantage we must apparently believe in addition that Arabs - ^hammar or others - put. the body among the other slain* which is not very likely to have occurred to them. /Statement of. Uadi bin. Saddl,. al 'AJmani., employe of tlie Politloal Agency, Kuwait. I remember mhe day on which the fight tooic place between Bin Sa'ud and Ibni l^ashid.. We had all encamped at Jarab the. previous night. Bin Sa'ud and his menu started at sunrise and we all shortly after- -wards followed them. Capm Thakespear and I mounted our separate camels and rode together. On arrival at Bagar 2 miles from Jarab. we saw the troops of Ibn Jlashid approaching in. the distance. Upon, this we made our encamp- -menl, our (l.e. Cap! Shencespear's) camels were tied up near those of Bin Fa.'ud.. The force then moved, forward in the direction: of the ll enemy,, the one field, pieoe with the infantry who had cavalry on either side of them.. Capt ^hakespear and I followed them for a « short distance, he then told me to return to the encampment with the camels, and to remain there:, and said that he was going on but not where or what, he was going to do. He started off on foot to- -wards the advancing--oroops„ and after, going a short distance, 3 topped, and looked through his field glasses. Having done this, he joined the force and advanced with. them. I returned with the camels, and then, some of BinHa'ud's young brothers oame to me and said 'What are you, doing here? Off with you, to the troops!' I re plied to them that. I was the Sahib's guard and had his orders to remain with the camp. Almost, immediaDely after ohis a slave of Bln Sa.'ud's wished to ta,ce my rifle away from me, but Abd-ul-Aoiz. bin. Ha&amp;un stopped him, saying that, I was the Sahib's man, and had mo guard the camp. I mhen. sat, down with Abdul Azim. and the others among the baggage. Shortly after this the fight.,, which was proceeding some 1000 yards from us, culminated in BinHa'ud’s force being put to flight and our being attacked by Shammar Cavalry from the left rear of Bin Ha,'ud' s army . Peeing them coming we all mounted our camels and o.le&lt; in company with. Bin ra’ud's soldiers who were making their escape, and left the oanp as it was. The Shaaaar horseaen pursued us and caught some including mys elf. They took from me my rifle and celt me little distance towards the left of ;v i et. me go. I then jpined the Umm Tair wl^9 Kuwaiti, where I arrived rive da^n later..

Vie gave up the water quest- and all returned in. haste to tue 3 a.ap where all was being prepared to raove forward. I went to eel j zho Sahib who was still asleep in hiB uenl. He rose and dressed having ordered me to prepare for an advance: BiniSa’ud's force had already set off on fool in the direction, of Bagar. Capt. Slia^espear and I mounted our camels and joined Bin Ca'ud’s force.- It. was then found that. Ibn laahid was still come dirtano« away-, bo the force returned to the enoampmefat. --very thing was then packed up by order 01 Bin* Sa’ud, and whe whole force,with baggage etc, advanced towards Bagar. At. this time, the Sahib and ITadi were riding together with Bin ra’ud, I _ was with tiie baggage, raoh of them was riding IfLr own earner.. Vie reached Bagar, and made a rougii encampment, for the camels but without unloading them. We could not actually see Ibn'.lashi and his men advanoing upon ue owing to some rising ground which lay in our front. Bin r!a*ud and his force advanced immediately after this* I caw nothing more of the Sahib and he was not. seen, again by any of our men after the return of Kadii* as regards nir cucseciuenu i°« I mow nothing beyond what I have mard from others*.WiUi the exoeptlon, of Iladl who was wUtlL the Sahilx at, first, and returned loading the oaaelB,, all our nien.,, inoluding tlie tivo private servants,, were with me and the baggage from our arrival at Bagar to our plundering by the Sliammar horsemen..

The Sha.aiaar did not oaptur^e me,, though bliey took everything I had,, and I made iay escape on foot to the Uiin fair with, whom I remained for 5 days, and then, made my way back to Kuwait. I remained with, the Umm Tair in hopes of getting news of the fahib. The day following the fight I heard fx-om an Umm Tair Bodu that he had seen the rahib’s corpse lying on the battle- -field. Two dayfj before the fight took place I heard tlie ^ai.ib and I Bln ra’ud talking in the formex's tent. Bin Sa'ud was telling f the Hahib that, he feared for hie safety and wished that he an&lt; his . eople would go to Zllfi until tie fighting was over. The ^aiiib declined saying that he must remain, with him in, obedienc to the orders of Government. r o far as I xcaow the rahib was quite unarmed on. the aay of th.t battle. lie had only his camera and field glasses.

I sat down with the baggage, and Abd-ul-Azit Din liasun, was there with all ou men except Had! who with the Bahib. who went after Bin, Sa.'ud and his men. The two started off on their camels,, arter which I did not see tire ^ahib again.. Hadi returned after perhaps f hour leadi -ing the two camels. I asked him where the Sahib was. lie replied that he had joined the fighters. After a short time the Shammar horsemen, came upon us:, they took everything I had of any value and struck me with a. sword slightly wounding me in the hand, they then, carried me away a short distance and set me free I joined ohe Umm Talr and. remained with them, fcr two days and then found Abd-ul-Aziz bin Kasun and.

Lieut-Colonel W.G.Grey, I.A Political Agent, Kuwait.Statement of Khalid bin Bil&amp;l of Zubair^cook of the late Captain Shakespear,C.I.E.,recorded on the 20 th May 1915 in the Political Agency, Bahrain, I went with my late master Captain Shakespear from Kuwait. There were about 50 men with him. We met Bin Saud at 'Khufsa' near Riadh. Two days after our arrival Saiyed Talib of Basra, who had been for some time with Bin Saud,left for Kuwait. Next day Bin Saud marched with his forces towards Jarab in order to with , , firght A Bin Rashid. After marching for several days we reached Jarab. On ouT way , at each stafee , parties ol Bedu joined us. Bin Saud was riding a horse but Captain Shakespear was on a camel. One day before the fighting Bin Saud ahd his son, Turki,tbid the'Sahib 1 that he should not accompany them to the battlejfbut had better either go to Qasim or to Zilfi where they would meet him after finishing the fighting. ’Sahib*did not agree and said it was dishonourable for him to turn back,and that he would accompany them in the battle. I heard the talk myself,as my tent was quite close to ’Sahib’s’ tent,and his butler, who was present at the interview,also told me so. Next morning at 6 A.M. bin Rashid’s troops were sighted and in less than two hours the enemy came fairly close to us. Bin Baud’s forces dug ditches at a distance of about 500 yards behind the fighting line and all the kit,tent and all sorts of luggage was loaded on camels which were made to sit in the ditches. ’Sahib left all of his servants but one,Hadi of Kuwait,in the ditches, and himself took a camera, and mounted on a camel with Hadi. they went towards the place of fighting. He had instructed Hadi to keep the camel when he dismounted and wait for him at that j j place while - * . - he went on foot. I was about SCO yards from where ’Sahib’ dismounted and saw him well. He went on to a mound and took photographs. Bin Saud ordered a general attack at 8 A.M. cavalry being on the right and left flanks and infantry in the centre. On the right one gun was working between the j| infantry and cavalry. The enemy however had superior cavalry and more men and soon dispersed Bin Saud’s army,causing a com plete rout.As they fled back I lost sight of ’Sahib*. The enemy plunder ed everything they could lay hands on. Many men were killed on both sides. Everybody saved his l&amp;fe as best he could. The fighting was over in about two hours. I was taken prisoner by Bin Rashid’s men the Bani Shammar. They wanted to take me to their country, but the second night I managed to slip down from the camel and to hide myself under a bush. I learnt from those people that Captain Shakespeor at first received a wound in his right elbow and afterwards was killed by two bullets ; or* i# the head and the other in the back. Next morning I returned towards the battlefield. For several days I lived on grass till I came to the tents of the Mutair who prevailed upon me to stay with them in their service. When, after marching slowly we reached the battlefield,I went round the dead bodies and recognized the corpse of Captain Shakespear. Everything had been stripped off him except a’ganji frock’. I found marks of three bullets on his body - one in his right arm,one at the back of the head and the third in the groin on the right side. I waw him twenty days after his death. I mana ged to slip away from the Mutair and in a few days reached r7 ilfi. Bin Baud had gone to Riadh. From Zilfijwith the help of some Bedu I reached Hassa. I went to Abdullah bin Jaloi,Amir of Hassa. He was informed who I was,but I received no help from him. An Hassavi whom I served once in Bombay took pity on my plight. He gave me clothes and K ? . 4 /-. I want to return to my home in Zobair.If t No Polloioal Agency, Kuwait. of 1915 . P x^om Lieutenant-Colonel V7. Q.

It appears that a fight took place on that day between the rival chiefs Bin Saua and Ibn Rashid ana that Captain Shakes^ ear insisted upon accompanying tk 6 first line of Bin Baud's troops ■ against his strong advice. According to reports which have been received from Bin Soud captain makespear was Killed instanta- -neously by a chance shot. 5 . I thinK that bin Baud’s version of what occurred is pro- —baly correct, ana I see no reason to hold him in the leaxt res— -ponsidle for the sad occurrence. 4 .
