No. 46. March 11th, 1939 ( 540/101/4). My Lord, In my telegram No. 29^ dated March 5th I had the honour to inform you cf the decision of the Saudi Government to send all their pilots to Egypt for training in aviation, and thereby to have an excuse to get rid of the Italian air mission. The training is to he effected by arrangement with Banque Misr, for Misr Airv/ork. 2. One of the items in the programme suggested by the Air Ministry over a year ago and referred to in correspondence of which copies were sent to me in Foreign Office despatch No &lt;,479 (E 7221/244/25) dated December 15th 19o7, was the training of some Saudi pilots by Misr Airwork at the expense of the Saudi Government; another was the training of some Saudi mechanics in aviation work, eithout charge, at the Royal Air Force depot at Aboukir. Until now the Saudi Government had made no effort to act upon the proposals which they accepted at the time with apparent gratitude. From a remark made by Shaikh Yusuf Yasin when I was at Riyadh in November it appeared that he believed that his Government were waiting for some move from His Majesty’s Legation, but going through the correspondence I found that there was no possible excuse for such a belief. I sent the Amir Faisal a personal letter recapitulating the various steps that had been taken in connection with the /aviat ion The Right Honourable &amp;c., &amp;c the Viscount Halifax, K.G. , &amp;c &amp;c .,aviation scheme, hut he sent no reply, and I am confident that Shaikh Yusuf's remark was a pretext to conceal the real cause of the Saudi Government's inaction, whatever that was. It seems possible that never until now, when a large revenue from oil royalties is within sight, could the Government afford the money that the training of pilots in Egypt would cost, and that unless they had the excuse that their pilots were to he trained abroad they could not pluck up courage to tell the Italian Government that their mission was no longer requiredo The decision must have been adopted quite recently, for only a short time before Shaikh Yusuf Yasin had put before me what he described as a personal suggestion, that His Majesty's Government should protest against the presence of the Italian air mission in Jedda on the ground that it constituted a violation of the Anglos Italian Agreement of 1938, in that it was an attempt to secure a preferential position of a political nature. On the strength of the Foreign Office views conveyed to me in despatch ITo. 206_ (E 2779/193/25) of May 31st. 1938 I informed Shaikh Yusuf that His Majesty’s Government had decided, when I put forward a similar suggestion, that nothing could be done on those lines* 3. Since the date on which I sent my above-mentioned telegram No. 29, Shaikh Yusuf Yasin has given me an account of interview which he had with the Italian Minister several days after the news that the air mission would no longer be required had Deen conveyed to him. Mr. Sillitti, who had been in communication with Rome, expressed the anxiety of his Government lest the Italian should be replaced by some other mission. Shaixh Yusuf assured Mr. Sillitti that this anxiety was unwarranted: the Saudi pilots were to /be© be sent to Egypt because the language there was the same, ardj because there were greater facilities there than could be provided in Saudi Arabia 0 This second argument, Shaikh Yusuf admitted to me, was not a very good one, since the Italian Government had offered to provide all sorts of facilities for aviation in Jedda. Mr. Sillitti had a grievance which suggested that the decision of the Saudi Government had been an unexpected blow to the Italian Government. He complained that he had been given no v/arning of the change of policy, and that recently the Italian pilot had been allowed to take a house in Jedda and to make preparations for installing electric light. It is true that the Saudi authorities allowed Colonel Savellini (very reluctantly, I heard at the time) to leave his quarters outside the town and take a house near the foreign legations, but apart from that it would be difficult, I think, for Mr. Sillitti to produce any evidence that the presence of the air mission was welcome to the Saudi Government, while at times it has been treated with such neglect and discourtesy that it would have been withdrawn by any government not intent upon the acquisition of a political advantage at almost any cost in money and dignity. 4. I understand that the Saudi Government hope to send off their pilots to Egypt before the end of this month. Shaikh Yusuf talked vaguely about sending some mechanics to be trained at Aboukir under the Royal Air Force scheme, but he said that the first thing was to get rid of the pilots so that the Italians might have no excuse for remaining. 5. I had not hitherto informed the Saudi Government of the handsome offer of the British Council (Mr. K. R. Johnstone's letter No.ARA/8/2 of October 26th. 1938) to assist two Saudi pilots to complete their training at some civil aviation school in the United Kingdom, as no attempt was /beingbeing made to take advantage of the free training offered for Saudi mechanics by the Royal Air Force. On learning of the new scheme for Saudi pilots I told Shaikh Yusuf of the offer which had been made by the British Council. He expressed gratitude, and said that once they got rid of the Italians they could look round and make plans. 6. I asked Shaikh Yusuf whether he thought that the example set by King Abdul Aziz in getting rid of the Italians would be likely to have any effect on the Imam of the Yemen. He said that it might, and that in any case the King would be sure to tell the Imam what he had done and to ask for the Imam's views on his action. 7. While this despatch was being drafted I was informed by the Russian pilot and his two mechanics that they had been instructed to go to Taif to repair a Wapiti machine which has been lying there unused for some years. The other three Wapitis have all been repaired, and have been used more frequently than the Italian machines recently. M. Naidyonoff suggested that it would be better to bring the fourth machine from Taif to Jedda and to repair it here, where the facilities ar^ greater, but this proposal was rejected. Probaoly the oaudi authorities do not wish to exacerbate the annoyance of the Italians by leaving their Russian rivals at work in Jedda. lu. Naidyonoff has given me two other items of information: that the hangar has been shut and all flying stopped, and that the Government think of sending to Egypt not only the trained pilots but some fr^sh candidates also. 8.

My Lord, His Majesty’s Ambassador in Egypt, in reply to Sir R,W. Bullard’s despatch to him No 0 1476/22/49 of July 5th. last, has been good enough to inform me that although instruction can be given at Aboukir to mechanics at any time of the year, the Royal Air Rorce authorities in Egypt have heard nothing from the Saudi Legation in regard to the proposal which was agreed to some eight months ago for the training of Saudi mechanics in Egypt. I now have the honour to report that I delivered without delay the substance of Sir M. Lampson’s message to the Qaim Maqam of Jedda, who made a note thereof and said that he would com municate it immediately to his Government. Since then I have heard nothing further in the matter. It may be that the negotiations which are now said to be in progress with Iraq for the appointment of an Iraqi air mission, or at any rate an Iraqi instructor in aerial matters, may be holding up any further progress. Or it may be that the Amir Saud has been instructed to go into the matter during his visit to Europe. 2. I take this opportunity to add such further information about aerial matters as I have been able to pick up locally: its source has usually been the Russian air pilot M. Naidyonoff, who, I regret to say, now informs me that he has obtained three months The Right Honourable the Viscount Halifax, K.G., &amp;c• , &amp;c• , &amp;Ccmonths leave and therefore expects to be absent from Jedda until next November,, 3. The second V/aoiti has been repaired and successfully tested by Me Naidyonoffo The disabled machine at Taif however has not yet been touched. 4. Abdullah al Mandili has been in Egypt for some months: probably from last May. He is a personal favourite of the Amir Neisal and receives from the Amir an allowance. In the past he has been very useful to the Amir in ministering to the diversions of His Highness' hours of ease. M. Naidyonoff thinks that he is being trained as a pilot at an Egyptian flying school near Heliopolis. He is about 24 years old. The other two nilots who were considered promising are named Sadiq and Hamza. M. Naidyonoff thinks that either they have orgotten their plans for being trained abroad, or that their superiors have told them to do nothing further in the matter. 5. As for Major Ciccti, he is to go to Italy very soon for an operation, and hopes to return in the autumn. He is being replaced by a fresh officer from Italy, who has never been to this country before. Major Ciccti's classes in aerodynamical theory for the Saudi pilots fell flat, largely because the Saudi pilots insisted on knowing the exact equivalent of each foreign technical word in Arabic. This was too much for Major Ciccti: indeed it is obvious that such words cannot exist. 6. It is thought locally that if an Iraqi mission does start work here, the Italians will be exceedingly annoyed. 7. A3 £fr. 50,000 7. A few flights in the Bellanca were made three days ago, hut apart from that no aerial activity has been observed since the aerobatj.es which celebrated the departure of the Amir Saud on August 4th 0 As usual there appears to be no petrol and no oil: the Minister of Finance has had to find (it is said) fifty thousand gold pounds for the journey of the Amirs to Europe and back, and that must have meant economies in other ways. 8. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty's Ambassadors at Alexandria (No.1830/22/57) and Bagdad (No,1831/22/57) and to His Excellency the High Commissioner for Palestine ot Jerusalem (No,1832/22/57).

[E 3627/193/251 Copy No. iSir R. Bullard to Viscount Halifax.—[Received June 20.) (No. 107.) My Lord. Jedda, May 30. 1938. IN my despatch No. 75, which I had the honou!• to address to you on the 21st April. I mentioned in the fourth paragraph that a flight of Saudi aeroplanes to Wejh, which had been contemplated for some time, had been abandoned. The project was revived, however, under the stimulus of the more generous budget for the new year, and eventually a flight to Yanbu, though not to Wejh, was effected. I understand that the flight might have been prolonged to Wejh. only the landing ground there was not ready. Yanbu is about 175 miles from Jedda in a straight line, measured on the map, and roughly half as far as Wejh. 2. Four machines took part in the flight. M. Naidyonoff piloted the Bellanca, and Major Ciccu was in one of the Capronis with one of the Saudi pilots. Two other Capronis were left to the entire charge of four Saudi pilots. According to M. NaidyonofF all five Saudis took a hand at piloting, and the take-off and landing were quite well done. Thus the Saudi Government now have five pilots who can follow the coast to Yanbu and land without harm. A sixth pilot, Abdullah-al-Mandili, who is as good as any of the others, was not on this flight, having decided to go to Egypt to train for civil aviation. 3. The time of the flight is given in the press as two hours and ten minutes going and two hours and a few minutes for the return journey. The press puts the speed of the Capronis at 160 kilom. (100 miles) pei* hour, M. Naidyonoff at 150 kilom. Judging by the map I conclude the lower figure to be the more probable. 4. It would appear that the Saudi policy of trying to weary the Italian air mission out by neglect has recently changed to some extent. Interesting evidence of this is afforded by two notices of the flight to Yanbu which appeared in the same newspaper, the Saut-al-Hijaz, a week apart. The earlier report stated that the first machine carried the Russian pilot, the second “ an instructor and three engineers.” Thus, as on an earlier occasion reported a few months ago, the Italian nationality of the instructor was suppressed. A week later the Saut-al-Hijaz says : “ There was missing from that account the name of the Italian instructor who led the flight of aeroplanes and supervised the journey.” It describes “ the Italian technical trainer. Signor Ciccu ” as giving the signal to start, mentions the Italian “ engineers ” (i.e.&lt; mechanics), and puts the Russian aviator last. It even transfers the Commandant and Officer Commanding Aviation, Said-al-Hurdi, from the Bellanca, in which he travelled with the Russian pilot, to Major Ciccu’s Caproni. 5. This later report bears out information which I had received from M. Naidyonoff, to the effect that Major Ciccu was making determined efforts, supported by the commandant, Said-al-Hurdi, to increase his influence. He did not succeed in obtaining executive powers, as he wished to do, but he secured the new French monoplane as an addition to his “ flight.” There are now, in theory, two flights :— ( 1 ) Major Ciccu— 3 Capronis. 2 Italian instructional machines. 1 new Caudron-Renault. (2) M. Naidyonoff. 1 Bellanca. 1 old Caudron-Renault. 4 Wapitis (one completely repaired, one nearly ready, and two much out of order). [330 u—2]2 Kaeh of the two foreign instructors has thus six machines in his charge, and the balance in favour of Major Ciccii, all of whose machines are in working order, is redressed to some extent by the fact that he refuses to fly the new Caudron- Renault, which he professes to regard as difficult and even dangerous, and that M. Naidyonoff has been using it to train some of the Saudi pilots. 6 . It is said that Major Ciccu has recently made an attempt to teach^ navigation to a class of Saudi pilots that began with five, but fell almost immediately to two. The task of imparting any theoretical training to these pilots is made almost impossible by their lack of mathematical and other education and of the practice of mental concentration, but the fact that some of them attend a class conducted by Major Ciccu shows that the boycott of the Italian mission has ceased. 7. The change in the attitude of the Saudi authorities towards the Italian mission affords an interesting subject of speculation. I think there is no doubt that until recently Ibn Saud regarded the Italians with suspicion and wished to prevent their getting a hold of any kind in his country. It may be that the Anglo- Italian Agreement, by removing Ibn Sand’s fear of Italy, has tempted him to put some of his eggs into Mussolini’s basket—a policy which may have been encouraged by the recent course of events in Europe. And perhaps he has begun at last to despair of inducing His Majesty’s Government to modify their Palestine policy. 8 . The press state that the flight to Yanbu is only the prelude to a series of flights to other coast towns, for the purpose of training Saudi pilots for flights “ in the heart of the kingdom and its parts.” There has been greater activity in the air during the last few weeks than at any time since the Italian air mission arrived, but it is the beginning of the financial year, and it is unlikely that petrol will be provided later in the year with the relative liberality with which it is supplied now. Whether the Italian Government can properly continue to provide an air mission at their expense if the Anglo-Italian Agreement comes into force is a matter of interpretation. To provide an officer and about eight mechanics, all drawing overseas allowances, and to change the mechanics every six months •or so, must cost the Italian Government a considerable sum, and, as I have suggested before, it is for consideration whether the effect of this arrangement is not the acquisition of a privileged position of a political character. On the other hand, what of the rights which the Iraqi Government wish to be free to exercise under the Treaty of Arab Brotherhood and Alliance, not to mention a suggestion that, has recently been made, that the activities of the British Council should be extended to Saudi Arabia ? 9. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s Ambassadors at Cairo and Bagdad, and to his Excellency the High Commissioner for Palestine at Jerusalem. I have, &amp;c. R.

These enquiries showed that no steps had been taken by the Saudi Arabian authorities with a view to putting the proposal into Operation. 3.

Sir, I am commanded by the Air Council to acquaint you, H(o(. for the information of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, that they have had under consideration Foreign Office Memorandum S 1375/193/26 of March 14th, 1938, forwarding copy of a telegram t from His Majesty’s Representative in Jedda regarding a suggestion by the Saudi Arabian Government that an Egyptian or Iraqi officer without knowledge of aviation might be suitable for the post of Chief of Staff of the Saudi Defence Forces. In the present state of pq^itical feeling in the Iraqi defence services and in Iraq generally the Council are disposed to doubt whether the appointment of an Iraqi officer could suitably be considered in connection with this post. The appointment of an Egyptian officer is also open to objections, as in the present development of the Egyptian defence forces it ia likely to be a matter of considerable difficulty to find an officer possessing the requisite qualifications. The Council are inclined to doubt therefore whether a solution is likely to be found on the lines suggested by the Saudi Government. They feel some sympathy however, with the objections which &amp;ing Ibn Saud foresees to the appointment of a British officer, and in these circumstances they consider that a solution is most likely to be found in the appointment of a suitable Indian officer. The Council realise that the selection of such an Indian officer will be a matter of some difficulty. In this connection however it will be recalled The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, Whitehall, S.W.l.that the Government of India when reporting their inability to recommend an Indian Moslem officer with air experience for this post did not exclude the possibility of finding a suitable officer without air experience. The Council would suggest therefore that a further enquiry might be made as to this possibility. I am.

[E 2127/244/25] Co Py No ' Sir R. Bullard to Mr. Eden.—(Received April 19.) (No. 51.) gj r Jedda, March 30, 1937. AS I had the honour to inform you in my telegram No. 26^dated the 28th March, on one of the occasions when Ibn Saud discussed with Mr. Rendel and me his relations with His Majesty’s Government, he said that it was he who originated the enquiry about assistance in the training of young Saudis in aviation which I transmitted to you in my telegram No. 118, dated^ the 25th October. This was by no means obvious to me at the time. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin has more than once tried to induce the Legation to communicate to the Foreign Office suggestions about Palestine which he could not say Ibn Saud would approve, so that it is not always certain that he is speaking with his master’s voice; while for Ibn Saud to apply to His Majesty s Government for the training of aviators when he had just received a supply of men trained in Italy would imply, it seemed, so sudden a reversal of policy as to be almost incredible. In any normal country doubts such as this could be cleared up in conversation, but for months after the enquiry was received the only Saudi official I ever saw was Fuad Boy, who never mentioned the subject, and had piobably been kept in the dark about it. However, the proposal is official enough, and in my opinion rather embarrassing, and it is not less embarrassing that a proposal for the training of men for civil and military aviation has grown into a larger scheme. The Saudi Arab Government now want to be provided, in the hist place, with ten military aircraft complete with pilots, mechanics, workshops and everything else necessary for them. The scheme should be capable of expansion. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin has since told me that what they have in mind is the training of five to ten fresh pilots every year and, I gather, a corresponding increase in the number of machines. It is left for the experts of His Majesty’s Government to decide whether the personnel should be trained abroad or in a school to be established here, and to say how the scheme can be most quickly carried out, what it would cost, and what would be the terms of payment. . . 2. I am fully aware that the Foreign Office considered that the original proposal should receive sympathetic consideration, and strong grounds for this conclusion were advanced in a letter addressed to the Air Ministry on the 1st December, copies of which were received with Foreign Office printed despatch No 339, dated the 2nd December. Nevertheless, my fears that the Saudi project could not succeed are so strong that I venture to recapitulate arguments which in one form or another I have already communicated to the Foreign Office. These fears are based on the following considerations :— (a) It would be difficult to secure suitable candidates. (b) The aeroplanes would never be properly looked after. (c) Pilots and mechanics, if trained abroad, would deteriorate rapidly on return to this country. (d) The Saudi Government do not possess the administrative experience or the organisation necessary for the maintenance of an air force. (e) The Saudi Arab Government have not the money for such a scheme. This factor, which enters into most of the others, is placed last, because it would be open to His Majesty’s Government to provide some or all of the money if thev thought the object of sufficient importance. These factors will now be considered in detail. 3. It will be remembered that I have reported on several occasions on information received from various sources, that the young Saudi pilots trained in Italy were not very efficient. Ibn Saud described them to us, with a gesture of contempt, as of no use. Now, although the Italians doubtless place [981 t—2] 1112 propaganda, and the desire to obtain a footing in this country, before the efficiency of the Saudi pilots, it is not to be supposed that they did not make the best of the candidates provided. They rejected a number of the candidates offiered; they gave those selected a year’s training; but at the end of their training, before any deterioration due to local circumstances could set in, th*^ pilots were of little use. This implies, I suggest, that Saudi material is not ver ; suitable. And what Ibn Saud now wants, it is evident, is military pilots of a high order. 4. It is not to be believed, by anyone who knows this country, that delicate machinery such as aeroplanes could be kept in a proper state of maintenance here unless there was a foreign organisation with executive powers. The deplorable condition of the motor cars in Saudi hands is by no means entirely due to the state of the roads, bad though that is, but mainly to the savage insouciance with which they are used and their maintenance neglected. In my despatch No^O^dated the 10th February, dealing with the Hejaz Railway, I used the Jedda^condenser as a measure of Saudi mechanical ability. We can speak with authority about this, because the condenser was run for some years by a British engineer who is now a member of the Legation staff and who still advises the Saudi Government on the subject. This relatively simple piece of machinery is always in danger of breakdown, although it is in the charge of a foreign engineer, because the Saudi authorities cannot understand what the maintenance of machinery involves. Yet the condenser is a source of revenue, and a breakdown at the height of the pilgrim season would have the most unfortunate effect. 5. Even if the pilots trained in Italy had been up to European standards when they returned, they could not have failed to deteriorate rapidly. I believe that to use Egypt and Iraq by way of analogy is unjustified. Let it be admitted that Saudi Arabia has as good material to draw upon, and that a scheme could be devised by which young Saudis could be trained abroad up to the level attained by the Egyptians and Iraqis. There remains the striking contrast in the conditions to which the various pilots and mechanics are to return. Both Egypt and Iraq have considerable armies trained by or under the supervision of foreigners; each has a corps of officers with some standard of conduct; in each country there is a British air force to serve as a standard of comparison. Here there is no regular army in the ordinary sense, and such standing force as there is is of the most casual description, without serious training and as often as not without pay. The returned Saudi pilots and mechanics would be alone. They would never have regular practice, because the Government would never recognise it is necessary or be prepared to pay for it, and they would sit about while their skill rusted away. The Saudi Arab Government could no more maintain their pilots and mechanics at the necessary level than their aeroplanes, unless they had at their disposal some foreign instructors with executive and financial powers, and I cannot think that they would give such powers to foreigners. 6. The lack of organisation and administrative experience would militate against the success of the air force project. There are almost no trained officials in Saudi Arabia, and the organisation of government is of the most primitive description. Outside the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, which is staffed almost exclusively with Syrians, and the courts and the Waqf departments which have some tradition behind them, the task of Government rests mainly, after the King, upon one man, Sheikh Abdullah Sulaiman. This clever Nejdi is Minister of Finance and Director of Defence, but he is also in charge of the pilgrimage and can be rung up for transport for pilgrims, and he supervises personally such things as the Jedda condenser and has to decide each time whether a given spare part should be ordered or not, just as he has to meet personally demands from oil and mining companies for escorts and requests from the ladies of the Palace to ^et them shoes or other requisites from the bazaar. Unless there was a complete revolution in Saudi methods, Sheikh Abdullah Sulaiman would be in charge of the military air force, and to get oil and petrol and spares would entail a continual struggle with him. That the Saudi Government should give executive authority to al’oreigner. and a budget within which he could make the necessary purchases, is, as I liave said, not credible. 7. The cost of the proposed scheme would be large, compared with the n&lt; 7 n resources of this, at present, very poor country. In my despatch dated the 11th March, about the financial position of the Saudi Arab Government, I suggested that any scheme which might embarrass Saudi finances was to be3 deprecated. I much doubt whether the Saudi Government could pay for the machines except in small instalments, which would always be in arrear and which Ibn Saud, with his poverty and our wealth, and his assistance over the Palestine business, in his mind, would think it heartless of us to press for. The lack of money would be a still greater obstacle to the maintenance of machines and men. ^ Payment for machines and for the training of men is at least a thing that the Saudis would understand, even if they thought that the prices were twice or three times as large as was reasonable, but the necessity for maintenance they would never admit, if only for financial reasons. The personnel would be wretchedly paid, even in theory, and would be deprived of the necessary practice, and half the time the machines would be out of commission for want of whatever corresponds to a ha’porth of tar. It is, of course, open to His Majesty’s Government to decide that the scheme is worth trying mainly at their expense. If they like to provide the aeroplanes with very little chance of recovering the cost, ti&gt; train Saudi pilots and mechanics at rates which Ibn Saud will think reasonable, and to support the air force financially when it has been called into being, they will have shown Ibn Saud that they wish to help him, but I imagine that a financial sacrifice of these dimensions would only be worth making for a scheme which was almost certain to succeed, whereas I hold that the Saudi scheme is almost certain to fail. 8. The political argument may be advanced that, if we do not accept Ibn Saud’s offer, we shall throw him into the arms of the Italians, who may then secure a hold not only upon the Saudi air force, but upon the cross-Arabian air route. I suggest that this is not necessarily true. The Italians have given Ibn Saud aeroplanes, trained pilots for him, and probably received little in the way of fees, sold him a very fine aeroplane hangar very cheap, and shown themselves ready to give him other facilities. He does not want this help, because he considers Italian policy a danger. Would he change his policy for the sake of help in aviation alone ? Then could he not be brought to see that for us to take the place coveted by the Italians would remind them that the only place left on the Arabian coast where the British had not a footing was the Yemen, and perhaps encourage them in the adventure which he most fears? The Rome understanding of 1927 is a kind of self-denying ordinance, and I suggest that if this principle was applied to Saudi aviation it would be a good thing. It is possible for us to sell aeroplanes to any ordinary country, and even to let their citizens train for aviation in the United Kingdom, without any close political commitments, but the Saudi scheme would demand financial help and adminis trative interference to such an extent that politics must come into play. It is true that the Italians have tried to obtain just such a position, but the attempt was made, in the first instance, during the Ethiopian crisis, and at a more normal time they might see the advantage of mutual abstention. I made the suggestion in my telegram No. 26 that a modest scheme run by “ neutrals ” might perhaps suit the situation best. Would not this appeal to Ibn Saud as less provocative to the Italians than his present scheme ? And would it not be less likely to expose him to criticism than a scheme which could be attacked by anti-British Moslems, e.g., in India, as a British attempt to control the Moslem Holy Cities from the air ? I have not forgotten the Swedish gendarmerie in Persia during the Great War, but the ‘ ‘ neutral ’ ’ help would not be on such a scale as to make the repetition of that strange episode possible. Besides, the scheme could be set up with the warning in mind and precautions taken accordingly. One objection to a scheme run by “ neutrals ” is that Ibn Saud is obviously offering the scheme to us because he needs our financial help for its realisation, whereas “ neutrals ” would work on a cash basis. But His Majesty’s Government could still help to finance the scheme, if they wished, and even provide the machines, though I hope that the scheme would begin on a more modest scale than that represented by ten military aeroplanes. , T u ^ • 9. ' The intention of the Saudi Government which I have reported in my telegram No , 27, d ated the 29th March, to embark upon a small rearmament plan apart from the air force, makes it easier for us to adopt a discouraging attitude in the matter of aviation. They will want our help m securing good terms for their cartridge factorv, and for the guns, shells and machine guns which they wish to acquire, and I suggest that we should give them all the help we can m these matters. They could run a cartridge factory, and to my knowledge they can fire off guns for I was in Jedda in 1924 when they hit the town of Jedda withshells many times. Even machine guns are not beyond their competence. If we could help them to obtain on easy terms stocks of war material which they can certainly make use of, or even give them some from the stocks which are now being replaced under the British rearmament scheme, Ibn Saud could not attribute to unhelpfulness any hesitation we might have to show about aviation. i r ^ 10. It happens, fortunately, that visits to this country have recently been paid by two British officials who will be able to bring experience of Saudi Arabia to bear upon the proposal to establish a military air force here, ^! e Mr Rendel and the Squadron Leader Janies who is mentioned in the Air Ministry enclosure to a letter No. E 483/483/65 which Mr. Rendel sent me on the 30th January. I would also suggest, as a means of making the Saudi Lovein- ment realise 1 what the maintenance of a military air force involves, that when His Highness the Amir Baud is in England for the Coronation, he and Sheikh Yusuf Yasin should be shown what lies behind the flight of aeroplanes which probably seems to them little more remarkable than the production of music trom a gramophone by the turning of a handle. , , H A copy of this despatch is being sent to His Majesty s Ambassador at Cairo.

BULLARD.- Cop;/ (E 3116/244/25) SECRET. 5 J937 Record of a Meetinrc held at the Air ivanisiry ^ on 21st May 1957, to discuss the question of assisting Saudi-Arab!a in the establ iohi ient of an Air Force. Present: Air Ministry. Foreign Office. Air Vice Marshal R.E.C.Peirse, C.B., Mr.G...Rendel,C.M.G D.S.O., A.F.C., D.C.A.S. Counsellor, 2v!r. C.G.Evans, S. 6. Mr. E.R. warner. Group Captain G.C.Pirie, D. D. Ops. Squadron Leader M.H.Ely, F.0.3(a) Mr.V.G.Stevens, F. I. The discussion opened with a reference to Sir R. Bullard's Despatch No. 51 of the 3_’th March, fro; which it was i evident that he was strongly opposed to the project for the establishment of a Saudi Air Force. The question of the despatch of an Air Mission and the gift of machines to Saudi-Arabia, the cost of which was outlined in the letter fl?om the Air Ministry to the Foreign Office of the 1st May, was then examined. It was generally agreed that the main objections to such a scheme were: - (i) That financially the scheme was impracticable. The cost of such a Mission was estimated at approximately £60,000 to £70,000 per annum with an initial outlay in the neighbourhood of £500,000 for buildings and equipment on the lines of an R.A.F. Station. (ii) That the Saudis were unable to equip and maintain an Air Force, having neither the necessary finance nor suitable personnel for the organization and maintenance of such a force, and therefore the whole venture w r as likely to collapse as soon as/as the Mission was withdrawn. (iii) That if we sent an Air Mission, even though only a civil Mission, to Saudi-Arabia, Italy might consider it a breach of the Rome understanding of 19&gt;7 and regard herself free to establish herself in the Yemen. Such an outcome would be both unwelcome to Ibn Saud and place us in an awkward and embarrassing position. Various alternative suggestions were considered (1) That His Majesty’s Government should provide a gift of machines and that the personnel should be Egyptian but paid by Ibn Saud. This was thought, however, to be difficult in view of the present expansion of the Egyptian Air Force and the consequent absence of spare personnel, (2) That the Saudis should be persuaded to turn to some ’'neutral' power. It was not considered likely that a 'neutral' pov/er would be interested, as the proposition would be very poor commercially; (3) That an R.A.F. Officer should be sent to Jedda to report on the soot and to impress the Saudis with the difficulties involved in the maintenance of an Air Force. - The Air Ministry considered that this would be a wa te of the Officer’s time:- (4) That the Saudis should be headed off onto commercial aviation for the present; (5) That Saudi personnel should be trained in Egypt. - It was feared that this would be expensive and might not be effective having regard to the poor quality of the Saudi material. (6) That a few obsolescent simple aircraft should be presented. - It was pointed out that these would make a poor showing compared with the Capronis and that there would still be the personnel, maintenance and repair difficulties. It was agreed that the prospects of helping the Saudis with their aviation were hopeless and that it would be better to concentrate on doing all that was possible to meet Saudi land armament/armament requirements, though the prospects even thehe were not much brighter. The meeting was then faced with the choice of either: (1) Temporising by sending out an Officer (possibly from Egypt) either on the active or retired list, to rnaxie a report and to try to impress upon the Saudis the difficulties involved; or (2) To inform the Saudis right away that nothing could be done. It was finally agreed that the Foreign Office should inform the Saudi Ministers now in England that we reluctantly were unable to find any practicable method of assisting them in their desire to establish an Air Force, pointing out the difficulties which were inseparable from such an undertaking but offering to give further consideration to any constructive suggestions which they might wish to put forward.Copy (E 3726/244/25) Air Assistance for Sa uii Arabia. ( 17r 7 ' *'&gt; JL • j 7965 i j 1957 j Nov/ that e have been able to offer t..e Saudi Government some help as regards the supply of arras (.see Foreign Office telegram No. 48 to Jedda of June 3oth), the objections to informing then, of the conclusion we have reached about air assistance no longer apply. I therefore took the opportunity of a visit which Sheikh Yusuf Yasin and Sheikh Hafiz \7ahba paid me on July 2nd to raise this question with them. 2. I explained that we had thoroughly gone into the matter in all its aspects in consultation with the Air ministry, and with every desire to help them in any way that might be possible. Our discussions, however, had led us to the conclusion that there was really nothing to be done. 3. As regards the supply of aircraft, aircraft were not like motor-cars, that could be simply driven until they fell to pieces with little or no technical maintenance. Modern aircraft of a type which we should li e to supply were extremely complicated machines requiring the most careful and highly trained maintenance service. or .shops 1 ith modern machinery and large supplies of spare parts were required. Moreover, it was essential to have a highly trained ground staff of s&gt; illed mechanics. None of this was possible in Saudi Arabia for the present, and even if we could supply the aircraft they would be no real or lasting use to the Saudi Government until all this ground organisation was established, and ve should let Ibn Saud in for a large expenditure far beyond the resources of his country to no purpose. ke could not conscientiously do this. 4. The same difficulty applied about training pilots. To be a good pilot it was necessary to have some kind of previous mechanical/mechanical or engineering training or tradition. Conditions in Saudi Arabia v/ere such that few candidates with the requisite qualifications were likely to 'be available. The Italians had indeed underta en to train a number of Saudis, but only a very small proportion had been able to profit by their training. Sven in such cases the difficulty of maintaining the necessary training facilities in Jedda meant that the advantage of the training would soon be lost. V/e should prefer, as good friends of Saudi Arabia, not to undertake a job which we could not successfully carry through, and were not prepared merely to take Saudi pilots ostensibly for training, but in fact for propaganda purposes. e should not be justified in asuing the Saudi Government to spend their slender resources so Taste fully. But in any case, pilots were useless without mechanics, and it was essential to be sure in the first instance of adequate ground staff. Until there were trained mechanics and a tradition of good mechanical wor.: had been created, we were very doubtful indeed whether it would be any use trying to produce effective flying services. 5. Finally, there was the important consideration of expense. The development of any x-ind of air service in these days was an extremely expensive matter. V/e were well aware of how limited the resources of Saudi Arabia were at present, and how badly needed they were, and fran.ly we did not see how, in these circumstances, the Saudi Government could ho^e to achieve their object. V/e felt that we should not be acting as their real friends if we encouraged them in the attempt. 6. These were the reasons which had led us to the conclusion that we could not honestly offer the Saudi Government any help in air matters. I greatly regretted this, but there was one compensating advantage. Had it been possible ior us to undertake to give the Saudis serious and systematic assistance in developing an air force, it was probable that tne Italians would/would have represented this as justifying them in intensifying their own activities in the Yemen. They ?/ould of course not have been justified in doing so, but there was reason to suspect that they were still somewhat deterred from adopting an even more forward policy in the Yemen by the fear that, if they did so, we might play a more active rOle in Saudi Arabia. There were considerable advantages therefore in their being kept guessing, since, if they came to the conclusion that v;e were trying to establish a direct influence over Saudi Arabia, this particular deterrent on their own activities might no longer operate. I used this argument with the less hesitation as Sir R. Bullard had already used it to King Ibn baud when His Majesty raised this subject with us last March. 7. I ended by saying that, of course, the Saudis were perfectly free to approach any other Powers if they wished to do so, and that they might perhaps thinK it worth while applying to some small Power such as Holland, v/hich might be prepared to do a commercial deal with them on a small scale, which would at anj rate have no political implications. I admitted, however, that the objections we had seen to offering them any help ourselves still applied. 8. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin and Sheikh Hafiz Wahba expressed considerable disappointment, but seemed clearly to grasp the position and to accept my argument, which they did not attempt to question. Sheikh Yusuf asked, however, whether we could not wor: out and submit to the Saudi Government some very simple scheme for at least preparing the ground for the eventual develop ment of a Saudi air force, e.g. by the training of a small number of mechanics and gradual establishment of a few mechanical work shops. He said that he did not mind how small or modest the scheme was, provided some sort of beginning could be made. 9. I said that I would immediately take this question Up with the Air Ministry and see whether we could suggest anything on these lines. (Signed G.h.Rendel. 3rd July. 1957 .@) z ? 5 NO DISTRIBUTION .

IThile the Amir Saud had been in Paris he had been approached with offers of assistance in air matters, not only by the French authorities but also by representatives of the Soviet Government. The King would not wiuh to engage a Soviet mission and would, in any case, prefer to replace the Italian mission by a British mission of, say, three officers and an engineer. But if the views of His Majesty*! Government were still those which had been expressed in the discussions which he and Sheikh Yusuf Yasin had had at the foreign Office Airing the summer, he would have to look elsewhere, possibly to some small neutral country, as had already been suggested. 3.

The following were present. Mr. G.W. Rendel ) Sir Reader Bullard ) ) Foreign Office. Mr. T.V.Brenan ) ) Mr. G. Ktherington-Smith ) Group-Captain Saundby Air Ministry. 1. MR. RKNDKL explained what appeared to be Ibn Saud’s purpose in trying to create a Saudi air-force, viz. the maintenance of internal security. If trouble threatens he at present sends out troops in lorries to occupy the wells on which the dissentients depend. This is a long and difficult job, but he could send out men and machine guns by air, and if the tribes knew that he was in a position to do this, it would be of great assistance to him. 2. After discussion agreement was reached on the following points:- (1) That for reasons already set forth on more than one occasion, the proposal that a British air mission should be sent should be abandoned. (2) That provided the Air Ministry confirm the suggestion made in 261/244/25, we should inform the Saudi Minister that the R.A.F. are prepared to give free training for months to a few Saudi mechanics at the Aboukir depbt (M.T. repair section) and to finish them off at the Flying Training School/School at Abu Suair, where perhaps some of the Italian trained Saudi pilots might come for a mechanical course* It is assumed that the training would be free* The students would live outside and keep themselves. (3) That it should be suggested to the Saudi Minister that for training in flying young Saudis should go to Misr Airwork in Cairo, the R.A.F. helping with the mechanical side as in (2) above. (4) That if the Saudis insist on having a mission in the country, they would do well to engage White Russians, but if they decide to accept a Soviet air mission we could not raise any objection. 3. GROUP-CAPTAIN SAUNDBY promised to inform the Foreign Office within a few days whether the Air Vlinistry could provide the necessary training free.@0 COPY. .*• *&gt; (E 6372/244/35) A Air assistance fo r 3audi Arabia . The Saudi Arabian Minister cal led on me this evening and asked whether I could yet let him have a reply on this subject. 2. In view of the conclusions of the meeting of October 25th (see S 6305) I told the Minister that I feared that, as regards the proposed British air mission to Arabia, the result of our latest and most careful reconsideration of the matter had been that we now definitely felt that we could not provide the desired assistance. There were two difficulties. 3. The first was that the proposed mission could really serve no useful purpose. There was not a sufficient basis of training and there were not sufficient mechanical facilities to enable such a mission to accomplish any really useful work, &lt;°nd we were not prepared to send a mission out merely to kick its heels or to undertake a task which we felt it could not do satisfactorily. This would be satisfactory neither to ourselves nor to the Saudi Government. 4. The second difficulty was that, unlike states such as Italy and Russia, we were unable to do things for nothing since our finances were subject to rigorous Parliamentary control. We should therefore be oblige^ to ask the Saudi Government to pay the full cost of such a mission, and our standards of salary etc. were such that this would be very expensive. We did not feel that we should be justified in asking the Saudis to pay so much for so little practical result. 5. As we could not supply an air mission ourselves we clearly could not criticise any alternative which the Saudi Government chose to adopt. But if I might venture to offer any adviceit wonld be that the Saudis should try to secure Unite Russians. These v.ere often most capable, as in the case of the present White Russian pilot employed by the Saudi Government. They were prepared to wor^ for very low salaries and had no political axes to grind. As regards Red Russians, it seemed clear that the Soviet Government would not supply a mission at a low cost unless they felt they could obtain some corresponding political a dvantage. It might not in practice prove very dangerous but it would be better, if possible, to employ pilots with no political associations. 6. Sheikh Hafiz said he quite understood the position as regards a British mission and thanked ^e for my advice about an alternative with which he seemed to agr^e. V. I went on to say that I still thought that it mignt be possible to do something in the direction of training Saudi mechanics and possibly giving some final training in Egypt to the Saudi pilots who had already taken a course in Italy. 'fie were, however, still awaiting a final communication from the Air Ministry about this and I hoped to let the Minister hear further on the subject within a few days. (signed) G. W.

My dear Minister, You will recollect that when I explained to you the other day how sorry we were not to he able to help as regards a proposed British Air Mission to Saudi Arabia, I said at the end of our conversation that I thought it might nevertheless be possible to do something in the direction of training Saudi mechanics. The possibilities in this direction have now been examined by the Air Ministry, who have informed us that they are prepared, as a first step, to receive up to a dozen suitably selected young men to undergo a preliminary course of twelve months training in motor and aircraft mechanical work in the Mechanical Transport Repair Section of the Royal Air Force depot at Aboukir in Egypt. The normal charge for a regular course of instruction for foreign personnel at this Aircraft depot is £1 per head per diem, but should the Saudi Arabian Government wish to avail themselves of the offer no charge would be made in the case of the Saudi students. These students would however be expected to find, and pay for, their own accommodation and meet their ordinary living expenses. The question of more advanced training to pupils who have shown promise during this initial period of practical instruction in motor mechanical work and on aircraft engines could be left for examination at a later stage. In addition it might be possible to arrange for a small number of suitable candidates (not more than six at a time)/ Sheikh Hafiz Wanba.

The firm’s charges for a full seventy-five hours flying training in a ninety days course would be £B430 per pupil. These charges would however be reduced at the rate of £E4 per hour for any pupil who did not require the full seventy- five hours flying. The foregoing charges are exclusive of accommodation and living expenses. course whether your Government wish to avail themselves of these suggestions.

Z. 81 50 '95 7 Aiy MINISTRY, ADASTRAL HOUSE, KINGSWAY, W.C. 2 . 6th December, 1937, Dear Baggallay, May I refer to your letter to Saundby of the 26th November (S 6927/244/25) I do not think that we can very well attempt to prescribe any definite standard of education for the Saudi pupils who want to go to At&gt;oukir. It seems to us that all that can be said to the Minister on this point is that they should preferably choose candidates who know as much as possible already about motor-car engines and who are in their judgment most likely among any possible candidates to be able to profit by further instruction which would be the maintenance of aircraft engines. It is too much to expect that the Saudis should be of any efficiency in English, but the staff at Aboukir has to deal with a mixture of races and should be able to communicate with them in colloquial Arabic. as to the date of their reception, we have no particular preference: they could come along as soon as they like. As you are aware, it is intended that they shall be responsible for their own accommodation, and they will, presumably, be able to find that for themselves according to standards of their ov/n. If there is any difficulty on that point, however, I expect our people at Aboukir might be able to help them. As regards the arrangements for training of Saudi pilots by Misr-Airworl^ I am not quite clear that very much can be said to the Saudi Minister. The Saudi Government has, no doubt/doubt, some channel of communication in Egypt, and the best thing would be for them to get into touch with the Company thereby, but it could be added that Middle East Headquarters, Royal Air Force, would be happy to give them any assistance in the matter in making arrangements with the Company. But the financial side of it would have to be settled direct between the Saudis and Misr-Airv/ork, and we hope that they do, in fact, realise that it is they and not H.M. Government who have to meet the Company's charges. It occurs to me on re-reading Foreign Office letter of November 18th to the Saudi Legation that the Minister might possibly have misunderstood it, though there was no real justification for his doing so. It would, we suggest, be as well in a further communication slightly to underline the point as to financial responsibility. I enclose, for your information a copy of a letter which Peirse has sent to Air Officer Commanding, Middle East. Yours sincerely, (Signed) C.G. Evans.Copy 3rd December, 1937 b! DU ! ^.1937._J My dear MacLean, Further to Evans letter of November 18th (s.39525). The Foreign Office have now informed us that the Saudi Minister has heard from his people that they wish to avail themselves of our offer to receive some of their people for training at Aboukir. They ask what standard of education would be required of the young men 'so that they shall not make the mistake of sending the wrong type'. The only answer which we can very well make to this request is that they should select men who already possess some knowledge of internal combustion engines and who are the most fitted by general intelligence among possible candidates to profit by a course of instruction. Our view here, as indicated in the last letter, is that it is no use drawing up in advance syllabi of training etc. and that this will have to be decided when they make their appearance. The Saudis are unlikely to be any good at English but Aboukir is presumably accustomed to dealing with a mixture of races and would be able to speak to them in colloquial Arabic As to the date of their reception at Aboukir, we take it that if you are going to have them at all it does not much matter when they come. At the same time that the offer of training at Aboukir was made the Saudis were reminded of the possibility of their sending some of their own pilots for training by Misr-Airwork. On this Walser T s letter to Pirie of March 6th, 1937, (S.21078) is relevant. We think that the Saudis must settle this for themselves with Misr-Airwork as they will be financially responsible/ Air Vice-Marshal C.T. MacLean, C.B., Air Officer Commanding, Royal Air Force, Middle East, Villa Victoria, Cairo.responsible. We are so informing the Foreign Office but we are adding that if Middle East Headquarters can give them any assistance in the matter they will be ready to do so. I hope this is not unduly' committing you. personally, I doubt whether the Saudis will be prepared to pay Misr-Airworks charges when it comes to the point, and there can be no question of their being met from British funds. It is fully realised here { that the reception of Saudi mechanics at Aboukir - or any other dealing with them - is from the Middle East Command^ point of view an unmitigated nuisance. But it is necessary to make some gesture. You know as well as or better than the Air Ministry the present political importance attached to keeping Ibn Saud in a good mood: and the offer of Aboukir was made after much consideration here by the Air Staff of all possible alternatives.

Please see the submission at P.Z.8530/36 about the suggestion by the Saudi Arabia Government that H.M.G. might assist them by training some of their people in aviation. This matter has since been under consideration by the departments concerned, and it is understood that the Air Ministry agree with the Foreign Office in principle that such assistance as is possible bfo/tSUfcU should be given. The actual questions under A investigation were (a) the possibility of training pilots in Sgypt, and (b) the cost of providing, say, six aeroplanes and equipment. Before this investigation was complete the Saudi Government, who ha*4 hitherto been rather vague/vague, made concrete proposals as to what should be done for them (Jedda telegram of 28th March, P.Z.2358/37). They apparently want a scheme which will give them in the first instance ten military aircraft with pilots, mechanics, workshops and everything else necessary, and which will allow *Jfe of gradual extension. They want to enlist H.M.G.’s help for land rearmament; their concrete proposals in this connection being at present the establishment of a cartridge factory at Riyadh and the purchase of guns, shells and machine guns (Jedda telegram of 29th March, P.Z.2358/37). Up to the present the Saudi Government have not yet specified their detailed requirements in arms and ammunition, and their latest suggestion (Jedda telegram of 12th April, P.Z. 2692/37) is that H.M.G. should state what help they are prepared to afford. They apparently have in mind some sort of scheme by which H.M.G. would provide cheap arms and ammunition,with payments by easy instalments. At the same time they point out that the Italian Government have offered to sell them either Italian or German rifles and machine guns. 2. The view of H.M.Minister at Jedda is that it would be a mistake to give assistance in regard to aviation since the Saudis will never make good aviators and the venture would probably be a failure (the Foreign Office and Air Ministry do not agree with this view but one would think that it is sensible). But he urges that most favourable 'and prompt answers may be returned to the requests for arms and ammunition. He suggests that we might give or sell at very low rates weapons which are now being replaced by more modern types. 3. It is obviously desirable to do everything possible to retain the friendship of Ibn Saud at the present time, but it rrmt the vagueness of the Saudi requests t* and the certainty that they could not pay commercial prices A for/Minute Paper Department. i/oo) n for anything which H.M.G. sells them, will presumably make it difficult for the Foreign Office to carry the Treasury with them. It looks very much as if Ibn Saud, despite his protestations to the contrary, is trying to A start an auction between the Italian and British Governments. ^ r % aw (Via. rtf* VV t ~ GO iY HO DISTRIBUTION Decypher.

He referred to community of interests which His Majesty's Government claimed to have with Saudi-^rabia and suggested it vas to the interest of Great Britain that Saucii Arabia should be as well prepared as possible to defend herself. In reply to questions he stated they had in mind payment by easy instalments, reduction of price, end in general any help we could give them. He specified as most necessary rifles, guns, machine guns and tanks. when I asked whether they needed tanks or armoured cars he said both or either. He added that he was authorised to tell me (and Ibn Saud begged that we would not think he was trying to play off one country against another) that on rt pril 10th Italian Minister said that Italian Government could sell them either Italian/-&gt; Italian or Gorman rifle and machine guns and v/anted to discuss terms. Ibn Saud, who gave us this information out of loyalty, proposed to keep the Italians in play. 3. I would request most favourable and prompt answers be returned.

Sir, I have the honour to state, v/ith reference to my telegram No. 27 of March 29th that according to information v/hich I have received from Shaikh Yusuf Yasin, Acting Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Saudi Minister of Finance, Shaikh Abdullah Sulaiman, who is also Director of Defence, has been for some time in communication with a firm in the United Kingdom with a view to the purchase of machinery for the establishment in Riyadh of a cartridge - making factory similar to one which has been supplied - by the same firm, I understand: Shaikh Yusuf Yasin did not know the name - to the Government of Iraq, Shaikh Hafiz ahba, who is on his way to Iraq with His Highness the Amir Saud, has been instructed to make enquiries about the plant which has been erected in Iraq, and I gather that he will pursue the negotiations in London. It would be part of the agreement that the firm should send out an engineer to Riyadh to erect the machinery and stay for two or three years to train Saudi workmen In its use. 2. I should not be surprised if the Saudi Government appealed to His Majesty’s Government for assistance in securing favourable terms of payment. 3.

Sir, V/ith reference to Foreign Office letter No.E 1138/244/25 of 20th March, I am directed by Mr. Secretary Eden to transmit to you the accompanying copies of two telegrams from His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda • regarding the assistance vdiich King Ibn Saud desires to receive from His Majesty’s Government in air matters and in connexion with his own land re-armament schemes. 2. The main questions of policy arising out of these telegrams will need further consideration by the various departments of His Majesty’s Government concerned as soon as the further detailed information promised by Sir Reader Bullard arrives. The matter is, however, one of considerable urgency, since King Ibn Saud’s attitude towards His Majesty’s Government may well prove a factor of great importance from the point of view of imperial policy, more especially during the next few months, when the report of the Royal Commission on Palestine is published and the decisions of His Majesty’s Government thereon become known. For this and other reasons the Secretary of State regards it as a matter of major importance to give King Ibn Saud’s requests the most favourable consideration v/hich the exigencies of our own re-armament programme and the practical possibilities of the situation allow. For the same reasons, it will be necessary, as soon as the promised information is received, to reach a very early decision as to what action, if any, can be taken to meet King Ibn Baud’s requests.

While no final decision can be reached until the full details have been received, Mr. Eden would strongly emphasise the desirability of this request being studied from the widest possible point langle, the political considerations involved being of 'far-reaching importance. 4.

In the wider interests however of countering Italian penetra tion in Arabia, a matter to which I attach vital importance, I feel bound, subject to consideration of the further information promised, to record my disagreement with the views expressed in paragraph 4 of the telegram under reference. It seems to me risky to leave the field to the Italians in the hope that they will fail and I dislike the idea of complicating the matter farther by bringing in other nationalities. Given imperial interests at stake, I see no sufficient reason why the question of expense should deter us upon this nor do I see V'/hy we should not simultaneously take steps to strengthen our contacts with the Yemen. I am aware that it may oe argued that positive action on our part may only stimulate the Italians further and provoke rivalry with them. I am convinced however that passivity will be a mistake and that the only effective way of dealing with Italian penetration is to adopt counter-measures and to make our interest in the matter clear.

We have had information from time to time about six aeroplanes (three instructional machines and three civil machines) which the Italians were presenting to the Saudis (for whom they have also undertaken the training of air personnel in Italy). The three instructional machines were delivered m Lay 1936 (para. 187 of the Jedda Report at flag A); para. 376 of the latest monthly Report (for November 1936) gives a convenient summary of the latest information about them. A Jedda despatch of 27th October last stated that only these three had arrived at that date. There may be more information in the report for December when it arrives (the T \0., we understand, have not yet got it). It is possible that the 'Times' report relates to the three civil aeroplanes. You will see that the press report about the 'aerodrome' seems to be partially confirmed by the Jedda Report (flag B) about the hangar. The/0 The Wapitis referred to were bought (to the number of four) from H.L'.G. in 1929-30.

Sir, In ny telegram Tio.118 dated October 26th I reported that Sheykh Yusuf Yasin had inquired privately whether His Majesty’s Government would be prepared to receive and to assist missions of young Saudis whom the Saudi Government wished to be trained in aviation. I now transmit a translation of his personal letter and a copy of my reply. 2. The history of aviation in Saudi Arabia is well known to you. ly predecessor r ported on the subject in L detail in his despatch ’o.l?6 dated June ‘ th. The present position, so far as my information goes, is this. Of the six Italian aeroplanes (make unknown) which it was believed were being presented to the Saudi Government by the Italian Government only three have arrived, and of these only one has been seen in the air at one time for some weeks past and two are stated to have received some slight damage. I have no information as to the use to which the machine presented by the Trench Government is being put. The old British machines (Wapitis) have not been used at all since the Italian aeroplanes arrived. The young ;audis who were sent * to Italy for training seem to have returned nominally qualified to act as pilots, but little is rnown about their performance as Saudi ’'eagles’*. 3o far as my information goes no Saudis have been trained as air mechanics, and this essential part of the functions of aviption is discharged by foreigners, viz., m three/ The Right Honourable Anthony Sden, -’.C.,- .P.,three White Russian refugees, and two Italians, who with an Italian pilot-instruetor, were sent with the Italian aeroplanes. 3. I was at first inclined to see objections to taking action on a private letter from 3heykh Yusuf Yasin, but I now see an advantage in this course since if the request cannot be encouraged by His Majesty’s Government, as I imagine it cannot, it can be rejected more easily than if it had been put forward officially. 4. I have thought of many reasons as having perhaps prompted 3heykh Yusuf’s letter, though I hesitate to give greater weight to one rather than to another. Sheykh Yusuf is inclined to embark on little schemes of his own in the hope, probably, of making some small coup and winning credit thereby. Then the Italian experiment has come to the end of the first stage and it may be that the Italians are either reluctant to continue because of the poor quality of the students, or will not go on with it unless they receive some proof of Saudi friendship which Ibn Saud is reluctant to supply. (In this connection I may mention that the ”3aut-ul-Hejaz* of October 20th published for the first time pieces of Italian propaganda taken from one of the Arabic newspapers distributed in Jedda by the Italian Legation). Or it may be that the relative success attained by the Iraq Air Force under British tuition has attracted Saudi attentions indeed, the commandant of the Saudi forces at Jedda recently praised the Iraq Air Force very highly in conversation with a member of the staff of the Legation, Or perhaps Sheykh Yusuf is courting a refusal so that we may be stopped from criticising Italian penetration in Saudi military affairs. 5. Whatever the motives behind the request, I do not suppose that it will appeal to His Majesty’s Government. It is unlikely that Saudi Arabia could produce five, still less ten to fifteen/fifteen, young men every year who would ™ake competent air pilots. It is possible that a few young men of good Fejdi origin could be found who, if they were put through a long, complete course, would make creditable pilots, but I much doubt whether )audi Arabia will be able for many years to come to provide men for a considerable air force, particularly the mechanics and other 8'illed artisans who would be required. I fear that the Saudi authorities are inclined to regard an air force as chiefly a matter of pilots, and aeroplanes as being ; rather like gramophones whose handles anyone can be taught to turn. 6 # I notice that in the conversation which the Air Officer Commanding, iddle East had with Fuad Bey Hamza on the 23rd April (reported in a despatch to the Air Ministry of which a copy was sent to Jedda in Foreign Office despatch No.130 dated the 14th May), he suggested that the iaudi Government should send some young men to England or -igypt to be trained as mechanics. If any Saudis are to be trained for aviation mder the auspices of His Majesty^ Government, I suggest that it would be better that the training should take place in Jgypt or Iraq, if this is possible, both because it would be cheaper for the Saudis and in particular because the students could not object if required to reach standards attained by other Moslems. But I doubt whether any arrangement that could be concluded would be satisfactory. The Saudis would expect His Majesty’s Government not only to teach their young men for nothing but probably to keep them too, and if they agreed to pay for them the payments would always be in arrears and this Legation would have to dun the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Nor is it likely that the students when trained would do great credit to His Majesty’s Government and any gratitude which we might win by agreeing to assist in the training of Saudi airmen would be dissipated if the returning/returning ''eagles’* failed - even if entirely through lack of skilled mechanics - to give satisfaction to Ihn 3aud. 7# v nee this despatch was dra'ted I have received a copy of the despatch N o. JL0J2 ^addressed to the Foreign Office by His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Rome on September 30th # in which it is reported that according to the ''Vie dell*Aria” arrangements have b' en made to send fifty more students to Italy from the Hejaz for training in aviation. This inclines me towards the last hypothesis set forth in paragraph 4 above. Ibn Saud may be committed, however unwillingly, to the arrangement by which Saudi airmen are to be trained in Italy and may wish to protect himself against possible criticism on our part by making a proposal which, if accepted at all, could only be accepted on such financial terms hs he could reasonably say were too onerous for his slender budget. But if I knew my suspicion to be well founded I should still hesitate to r; commend a scheme which in the long run would not I fear give satisfaction to either party. 8.

I am also glad to convey to you an expression of His Majesty's pleasure for hearing of the friendly conversations between us in the affairs we discussed and which I submitted to His Majesty.

The Mission which will be sent shall not exceed ten to fifteen persons a year and it will be annually year after year.

With highest respects. Yours sincerely, (.Signed) Yusuf YasinNo. 1845/32/54 Personal British Legation, Jedda. 26th October, 1966* Dear Sheykh Yusuf Yasin, I hasten to reply to your letter of 2nd Sha’bai (October 18th) which reached me yesterday and to express my thanks for the kind message from His Majesty the King which had the honour to receive by that means. I am reporting to His Majesty’s Government by telegraph your private suggestion about the training of Saudi students in aviation in England, and will communicate their reply to you as soon as it is received. I hope that there is no need to assure you with what sympathy His Majesty’s Government must regard the desire of the Saudi Arab Government to secure technical training for their young men so that they may take part in the development and defence of their country* Nevertheless I feel that I ought to i^emind yo \ that at the present moment His Majesty’s Government are engaged in the reorganisation and wide extension of the British Air Force, and that according to my personal information, this task occupies the time and energies of the aviation authorities fully that they might find it difficult to provide for Saudi students the facilities which the training of pilots and aircraftmen requires. This training is a long and expensive business and I *now that my Government would not w'sh to undertake it unless they felt that they could secure results that would do credit to both parties. In this letter, however, I am speaking privately just as you were in your letter. Hope to be able to write to you more definitely on the subject very soon. Yours sincerely, (Signed) R. V. Bullard H.E. 3heykh Yusuf YasinSir, TUth reference to Foreign Office letter No. 6711/90/Sqi5 of Jd &gt;th Oct ober enclosing, for the observetions of the Air Council, a copy of teltgram No.il of October Sd6th from Hie Majesty’s Minister at *j edda regarding the desire of the Sauai Arabian Governmeut to sen! a certain number of Saudi subjects to this country for training in civil end .ailitary aviation, I a,a directed by *ir. Secretary ^.den tD tra salt to you the accom anying copy of a despatch which he has now received from Sir Reader Bullard on this subject. R• r. ^den a,-.reela tee the arguments a^v^aced by Sir Reader Bullard against Sheiich Yusuf Yasin's proposal, but he considers that the c se for giving it syia ^thetic consideration is nevertheless a strong jne. It may well be that the ordinary rather backward Arab from oauai Arabia is unlikely to make a first class pilot. But the Iraqis have been able to produce a reasonably efficient air force under British guidance in a comparatively short sjace of time, and both Arabs and Egyptians have shown reasonable capacity to becoie good motor mechanics. In these circumstances the possibility of training Sauai Arabs to become adequate air pilots and mechanics should in Mr. Aden’s opinion not be ruled out except after full consideration. 3.3. Moreover, if His Majesty’s Government stand aside in this question and refuse to give the Saudi Arabian Government any assistance in response to the present proposal a clear field will be left for other countries, who are prepared to incur considerable expenditure with a view to establishing their position and prestige in the Arabian Peninsula. Were His Majesty’s Government to adopt a policy which might be regarded as driving the S.,udi Arabs into th: hands of the Italians, for example, Italy might eventually obtain a privileged position in air matters in Arabia and thereby secure facilities for the establishment of an air route under Italian control from the Red Sea to the Persian Gulf or from Egypt through Arabia to the Yemen. The Italians are extremely anxious to establish air bases on the Arabian coast of the Red Sea and in Arabia itself, and anything tending to make aviation in Arabia more exclusively dependent on Italy than it already is would go far to facilitate this object. Mr. Eden hopes that full weight will be given to this consideration. 4. Mr. Eden is aware that the Saudi Arabian Government do not dispose of sufficient funds to be able to pay large sums for, .the training of their pilots, and that cases have occurred in the past where great difficulty has been experienced in collecting money due from the S a udi Arabian Gover ment to His Majesty’s Government. But the recent grant by the Saudi Government of oil and mining concessions in Saudi Arabia has furnished them with somewhat greater resources than they disposed of in the past, and, if they are indeed anxious to develop their aviation, they may be prepared to ear mark part of the resources now available for/for this particular miroose. In any case it is for consideration whether the political and air issues involved may not he of sufficient importance to justify a contribution by His Majesty’s Government for the purpose of facilitating compliance with the present Saudi rabian proposals. 5. In Mr. Kden’s opinion, if the training of Saudi Arabian pilots in this country should on grounds of expense or for any other reason prove impossible, the suggestion mentioned in paragraph 6 of Sir Reader Bullard’s despatch, that Saudi pilots might be trained under British auspices in Kgyot or Iraq, is worthy of full examination. 6.

[E 3951/90/25] ... ' Copy 1 Sir A . Ryan to Mr. Eden.—(Received June 29.) (No. 176.) Sir, Jedda, June 8, 1936. IN my despat ch No. 89 o f the 28th March I gave some account of the position regarding aviatioriMn this country. Before leaving Jedda for good, I have the honour to bring the subject up to date to the best of my ability. 2. It has now been ascertained that three of the Wapitis bought by the Saudi Government in 1929-30 are in useable condition, although there would appear to be a deficiency of spare parts. I have heard nothing more of the idea of reconditioning the fourth machine, parts of which have, I understand, been used to supplement deficiences in the others. 3. The White Russian personnel recruited in 1934 has now been reduced to three persons, who remain from the original party. These are :— Nicholas Nadenhoff, pilot. Maximoff, chief mechanic. L. Koujlavsky or V. Makouetsky, second mechanic. The first named is normally stationed at Taif, but, with his wife and the remaining personnel, is reported to be at present in Jedda. 4. Eight of the students recently trained in Italy returned to Jedda on the 4th April and came back here after a visit to Mecca, where the King and others showed them great attention. They have not apparently had anything to do with the Wapitis. Indeed, they have done very little flying of any sort, excepting some trial trips, made under the direction of the Russian pilot, towards the end of April in the aeroplane presented by the French Government in March. When they first got back they presented a smart appearance, but they seem now to have reverted a good deal to local habits, and are more often seen in. native dress than in their quasi-European uniform. They came back full of the praises of Italy, and have been in some sort propagandists on behalf of that country. They are exceedingly discontented with their treatment here after having been rather spoilt abroad. They are accommodated in the local Government hotel, but they are ill-paid. They do not seem to have shown much efficiency during their trial flights, but could plead that the machine was unfamiliar to them. The remaining two students arrived in Jedda on the 31st May. 5. The new French aeroplane has not been seen in Jedda for some time, and I do not know what, if any, use is being made of it. When flown here in April it seemed to take the air well, but I think that the Saudis were from the outset disappointed at its small size. The idea that the Heir Apparent might fly back in it to Riyadh was dropped in deference to the King’s objections. 6. I have reported separately on the offer of the Italian Government to supply six aeroplanes for training purposes and civil use. I informed you in my telegram No. 75 o f the 1st June of the arrival of three of them, packed in cases, from Massawa. I have not so far obtained any particulars of them, except that they are small instructional machines; nor do I know what arrangements have been made for assembling them. So far as I know, the new instructor to replace the officer mentioned in the telegram just referred to is still awaited; but two Italians, stated to be mechanics, who are staying in the local hotel, may have come in connexion with the aircraft presented by their Government. 7. I have adverted in other reports to the efforts which are being made by the Saudi Government, jointly with the Arab Aeronautical Society, to secure further aircraft. These fall under two heads, viz. (a) the enquiries made by Fuad Bey Hamza in Egypt, of which I had some anticipatory knowledge, but which are dealt with more fully in the telegram from the Air Officer Commanding, Middle East, to the Air Ministry of the 23rd April, a copy of which you sent me under cover of your printed despatch No. 130 of the 14th May; and (b) the [731 ff—1] ~~■■H collection of subscriptions in Mecca, Jedda, Riyadh and Medina for the purchase of aircraft to be called after these cities. The local press announces periodically the amounts collected up to date. The latest totals I have seen mentioned work out approximately as follows, after converting sums stated in other currencies to gold pounds : The figures for Medina have not yet been published. 8. It is worth noting that the efforts of the Arab Aeronautical Society to get funds have extended beyond Saudi Arabia. Subscriptions have been obtained from notable pilgrims, and you will have seen from the Koweit Intelligence Summary No. 5/ HK iO-Xif the 6th April, that appeals have been launched in Koweit and probably m other Arab countries. 9. It will be seen from the foregoing account that the idea of civil aviation has definitely caught on in Saudi Arabia. Further developments may be expected, especially if the Banque Misr group, and possibly other foreigners, e.g., in India, succeed in due course in organising air services for pilgrims, which would help to impress the Saudi Government and the local public with the advantages of aerial transport. I fear, however, that the progress of local aviation will be slow and unsatisfactory, until it is realised that success can be achieved only by co-ordinating carefully the arrangements for both aircraft and personnel, and by being prepared for considerable expenditure on upkeep, &amp;c., after both have been provided in the first instance. On the other hand, there is no reason to suppose that young men recruited in the Hejaz and Nejd, with others from Syria and other Arab countries, could not be trained to be reasonably efficient pilots and mechanics. They at least have the necessary intrepidity. 10. To make this and my despatch under reference self-contained, I may remind you that there are now two foreign-owned aeroplanes in the country, that of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company, which operates in and about Hasa, and the Bellanca four-seater, imported by the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate (Limited). The latter arrived in Jedda on the 29th April, but is now based on Wejh, where the syndicate are busy prospecting. It is piloted by a United States citizen named Mountain, who previously worked for nearly a year for the California Arabian Standard Oil Company in Hasa. His wife is employed as wireless operator. The mechanic is another American named Dissel. You will remember that the Minister of Finance seemed at one time to be interested in American aircraft for this country. The introduction of two American machines by commercial firms may possibly be a stimulus in this direction, unless the Italians, having trained pilots and given some aircraft for nothing, sweep the board altogether. n. i am sending copies of this despatch to the Department of Overseas Trade, Cairo, Bagdad, Jerusalem, Bushire and Aden.

SINCE I wrote my despatches Nos. 46 and 94 of the 17th February and the 26th March, 1935, this Legation has had no occasion to address any special report to your department regarding the progress of aviation in this country. The matter has been touched on in various passages in the monthly Jedda reports and in semi-official letters, but I think that the time has now come for a more connected, though summary, account of the position. In order to make this despatch self-contained, I am including in it some of the more important facts that have been recorded elsewhere. 2. Comparatively little has been seen in Jedda of the existing Saudi Air Force since February of last year, when its base was transferred to Taif. This makes it difficult to follow its fortunes as closely as I would wish. There has, however, been no material change in the equipment or personnel of the force. I he aircraft taken over from the Hashimite regime can be dismissed as completely valueless. Two certainly, and possibly one other, of the Wapitis bought under the auspices of His Majesty’s Government in 1929—30, are in working condition. I have heard lately of some idea of attempting to recondition the fomTh, which crashed in the lagoon just north of Jedda in September 1931, but 1 doubt the feasibility of this. The personnel of the force still consists of W hite Russians, originally recruited in the circumstances described in the correspondence ending with Sir Miles Lampson’s despatch from Cairo, No. 51 of the 17th January, 1935. There may have been slight changes in the composi tion of the party, but its character remains unchanged. Some are at Taif. The mechanical engineer, Maximoff or Maxim, remains in Jedda, and appears to be employed for miscellaneous purposes. 3. The press has published from time to time optimistic accounts of the progress of the Saudi student-aviators, whose departure for Italy was reported in my despatches under reference. Private information is less glowino-. According to my Italian colleague, they made a very poor impression in Italv. One showed promise, but the rest were found to be incapable, quarrelsome and undisciplined. Ibn Saud himself expressed a verv moderate opinion of their progress in conversation with Captain de Gaury aF Riyadh last July. It would probably, he thought, take much longer than had been expected to make them efficient, but he hoped eventually to use the two best of them for a weeklv air service between the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea via Riyadh. 4. These young men recently completed their training in military aviation, and were then, according to the local press, to go for a month to a school of marine aviation. They sailed from Naples, homeward bound, on the 8th March and are expected to arrive in Jedda from Massawa on the 3rd April It is anticipated that a rousing reception will be given to “ Our Eagles,” as the local papers love to call them. 5. I now come to the development which has most immediately impelled me to write this despatch. When reporting the presentation by my French colleague on the 25th February of his credentials as Minister Resident, I confirmed a previous report that the French Government were presenting an aeroplane to Ibn Saud. It was announced in due course that this would arrive on the 20th March. Arrangements were made for it to be met by Amir Feisal on that date, and for the King to come to Jedda to receive the gift next dav it was not, however, until the 25th March that the aeroplane actually arrived having come from France via North Africa and Egypt and landed at Yanbu the previous day. Royalty adapted its plans to those of the French staff-work Ibn Saud arrived in Jedda early on the 26th March, and in the course of the day r68J u— 3]3 received my French colleague, together with a colonel from the French Air Ministry and the pilot. He does not seem to have visited the aeroplane. 6. The new aeroplane is, I understand, an ambulance machine refitted for royal use. It can accommodate three passengers besides the pilot. It is described to me as a Caudron-Renault “ Pelican ' monoplane, bearing the number C. 510 and the identification letters F-AONS. It has an inverted engine, similar in size and appearance to a “ Gipsy Major.” 7. The heir apparent is understood to be anxious to fly in the new aeroplane to Riyadh, and may be accompanied by the Amir Feisal. I gather that, if this flight takes place, the aeroplane will be driven by the French pilot who brought it ouf. The King himself, so Mr. Philby tells me, has no inclination whatsoever to take to the air. 8. In the earlier of my despatches under reference I mentioned the renewed activity of the promoters of the Arab Aeronautical Society. Some further information on this subject came to my notice shortly after I wrote that despatch, but it was not worth sending home in a separate despatch. The society was active in collecting funds during the 1935 pilgrimage season and received some handsome donations from notable pilgrims. Little further was heard of the society until a short time ago, when it became known that the Saudi Government or the society contemplated buying two aeroplanes suitable for civil flying. The funds of the society may now be adequate for this purpose, as it claimed early last year, at the outset of its fresh burst of energy, to have already collected during the earlier phase of its existence £2,094. Paragraph 73 of the Jedda report for January to March 1932 suggests some doubt, however, as to whether this amount was actually paid up. 9. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Department of Overseas Trade, Cairo, Bagdad, Jerusalem, Bushire and Aden. I have, &amp;c. ANDREW RYAN P.S.—Since drafting this despatch I have learnt that the officer who came with the French aeroplane is a Colonel Pitault. I also now understand that the King is very reluctant to allow the Amir Saud to flv in the aeroplane to Riyadh A. R.I *r 17 PROSPECTS IN ARABIA CHANGED POLICY IN FINANCE THE NEW RAILWAY By H.

During the fasting month of Ramdhan (January), always for obvious reasons a period of physical and psychological exhaustion, the sky was black with clouds.

Everything depended on the annual pilgrimage, and for the first three years of Wahabi rule everything went well, and the pilgrims from Java, India, Egypt, and other countries poured into the Hejaz, bringing wealth in their train. With the slump came the reckon ing. The Government of Sa'udi Arabia had spent lavishly and had built up no reserve; suddenly the position became really serious. One of the leading citizens of Jeddah, with 50 years’ experience of the Hejaz, could declare that the local conditions resulting from the general de pression were worse than anything known during the worst periods of Turkish or Sharifian rule. To me they recalled the most distressing features of life at Jeddah during the . siege of 1924-5, when the tune was set by the piteous cries of the beggars, imploring help in the name of the Lord. The economic troubles of Arabia had begun during the pilgrimage ceremonies of 1931. From an average of about 100,000 a year the nutpber of pilgrims had dropped to the region of 40,000 in 1930. It was still smaller the following year. The pilgrims were assembled as usual at Muna for the holidays after the ’Arafat ceremony; the vendors of foodstuffs and mementos had as usual spread out their wares at every point of vantage along the streets. Every third or fourth stall concerned itself with money-changing, chaffering the silver and nickel coins of the realm against the gold and paper of foreign lands. Under the laws of the country a silver Riyal (the equivalent of a florin) is worth 22 nickel pennies, but on this occasion the Shroffs (money changers) had decided to do a little speculation at the expense of the nickel coins. The Riyal was to be attacked later if the nickel offensive prospered. The value of the penny, the pet coin of the poorest, dropped slowly at first and then more rapidly, being quoted at 24, then 30, then 40, from which there was a facilis descensus to the 80's and worse. The Government could have stopped the rot by prompt and firm action, but it was badly advised, and did nothing till the rate had touched 44, representing 100 per cent, depreciation. TRIUMPH OF THE SHROFFS At that stage, incredible as it may seem, it accepted the fait accompli of the triumph of the Shroffs. A royal decree fixed the value of the Riyal at 44 pennies, and the officials of the Finance Department went forth to buy poor pennies against good silver at the new rate. They soon found that they could improve even on this. They could and did get 80 and more pennies for their florin; and the next day the royal decree was rescinded, restoring the par of exchange to the original 22. The Shroffs and the Government had made profits, while the poor had lost, and, once for all, the coins of the realm had lost their savour. An enterprising merchant, warning his agent at Medina by telegram to be careful in dealings in local currency, found'himself in gaol. But nothing could be done to re-establish public confidence in the royal superscription, for in Arabia there is no image on the coins. The banks left the local currency to find its natural level, and the Riyal fell steadily to its intrinsic silver value. Standing at the artificial rate of 10 to £1 (gold), it had been the Shroffs’ real objective. Now you can buy 20 Riyals for a golden sovereign. Thus in terms of silver the cost of living increased by 100 per cent., and trade suffered. The sudden drying up of the ordinary sources of revenue warned the Government of its coming difficulties. The total debt of the country was then about £300,000 (gold), while the officials and police were among the first to feel the strain, as their salaries fell into arrears. By November, 1931, these arrears were estimated to represent the equivalent of a six months’ salary bill. The Government now took resolutely the only action possible. It declared a year’s moratorium, thus gaining a much-needed respite, and introduced ad ministrative economies. But, as time passed, the prospects of an improvement in the world situation and of a better pilgrimage became more remote. Pessimism gained ground, and the Ibn Rifada trouble of last summer created a sense of hopelessness. Drafts on the Customs revenues were handed out in satisfaction of debts and even in payment of salaries. And so the process of mortgaging the future resources of the State went on until the day of reckoning came in November, 1932.

(No. 338. Confidential.) Sir, . Jedda, November 22, 1933. I HAVE the honour to report that Talaat Harb Pasha, who is described in No. 45 of the lust of Leading Personalities in Egypt, enclosed in Cairo despatch No. 68 of the 9 th January, as a Senator and chairman of directors of the Banque Misr, is understood locally to be flying from Suez to Jedda, with stops at Wejh and Yanbu, on or about the 2nd December, in a De Havilland Dragon aeroplane belonging to Messrs. Misr-Airwork; a ground engineer sent by the latter to prepare the ground for landing arrived by steamer on the 19th November, and the agency work for it has been entrusted to Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co. (Sudan) (Limited), Jedda. 2. Talaat Pasha's objects in this visit, which is not expected to exceed four days, are said to be threefold, viz., (a) to fix up local representation for the two pilgrim ships, which, I understand, have recently been purchased by the Egyptian Government for the conveyance of Egyptian pilgrims to and from the TIejaz; (b) to organise the sale of Egyptian products in this country, in particular the cotton goods which are said to be produced nowadays by a subsidiary company of the Banque Misr; and (c) to explore the possibility of the Banque Misr opening a branch in Jedda to assume the functions of a State bank for the Hejaz, in view of u the apparent demise of the ex-Khedive’s project (see the correspondence ending with your confidential despatch No 1 266 of the 5th October). 3 . To these objects may, perhaps, be added a fourth, namely, that of demon strating one of Misr-Airwork's aeroplanes to Ibn Saud. You will recall that this company last year proposed to send an Avro to Jedda for this purpose (see the correspondence ending with the Acting High Commissioner for Egypt's Savingram to you, No. 91 of the 19th August, 1932), but did not proceed with the scheme. Their object at that time was to sell Ibn Saud light military aircraft, and it seems probable that the recent reports of tension between him and the Imam Yehya have led them to consider the moment opportune for a serious effort to this end. Local gossip is rife on the subject, the establishment of an air service between Egypt and Jedda being suggested in some quarters, whilst other and unkinder ones suggest that Talaat Pasha's idea in arriving by air is to be able to leave the country quickly in the event of war with the Yemen materialising. 4 . The aeroplane, if and when it arrives, will he the first machine of any sort to fly in or near the Hejaz since the ill-fated Wapiti, whose crash was reported in Mr. Hope Gill s telegram No. 201 of the 14th September, 193L Its arrival may serve to focus local attention on the parlous condition of tbe Saudi Air Forc e. The latter still consists of the four Wapitis and^ five old , D. 1 i ■ 9's bought from His Majesty’s Government; but the former, which alone might be made to fly, still remain, as they have remained since the time of the crash referred to above, in their ramshackle hangar, with absolutely no attention except an occasional greasing by an inexpert hand; while Ibn Saud remains without a single pilot capable of flying the machines, and without a single competent air-mechanic. No attempt has been made to develop any ground organisation, and projects, which have been reported on various occasions from this post, of engaging Turkish pilots and/or training Saudi subjects in Turkey, have remained unrealised. 5. With Saudi finances still further depleted by the war-preparations, the scale of which is easily the greatest yet made, the prospects of Ibn Saud being able to afford the heavy and continuous expense of employing competent pilots and ground staff, and of his embarking upon the essential refitting of his present machines and the ground organisation necessary for any extensive flying, are receding further and further into the future. The prospects of his buying new machines seem even more remote, however tempting the opportunity thus to steal [991 m—1] -7 December 12. 1933.

My dear George, I see 5y the enclosure in your despatch No. 17u (E 2407/463/25) of May 26 that the Foreign Office are strongly t'i' ■&gt;’ supporting the idea of a Royal Air Force Mission for this country. I appreciate your desire to give the Hejazi Government some one piece of satisfaction as a result of their mission’s visit to London, in addition to the hospitality and the decorations, but I feel bound to express my misgivings, i have never believed much in the theory that, by helping the Hejazi Government to develop an air force, we shall help ourselves towards an ultimate predominance in aerial development, in Arabia, even on the large assumption that the Saudian system is destined to survive. The maximum advantage X foresee is 'that we may sell some material# For the rest my misgivings may be summed up under the #7^ | COPY.

Few people in this peninsula, however, take that settlement seriously; and Ibn Saud’s present diificul ties increase the chance of his wanting to drop bombs on his own subjects; possibly also the chance of his seeking relief in wild adventures beyond his frontiers, though this is less likely. (b; I think you underestimate the difficulty of ensuring payment, unless you are prepared to tie the Hejazi Government up in Bankers' guarantees or to contemplate arrangements which will enable His Majesty’s Government to threaten/ George Rendel, Esq.., C.M.G., etc., etc., etc*threaten to recall the Mission at a moments notice in case of defaulte (c) Any mission which comes may expect to have a rotten time in every way, what with tne incapacity of the authorities here, the largeness of the field for intrigue.the difficulty in providing the most moderate accommodation, restrictions on drink etc., etc., etc. If, nevertheless, the project materializes, you will ^rm-h+.ifiss consider.

(E 3546/463/25) AIR MINISTRY, G.W.Rendel, Foreign ADASTRAL HOUSE, KINGSWAY, W.C.2. 13th July, 1932. My dear Rendel, Your letter E 2407/463/25 dated the 26th May about our discussions with Fuad Hamsa on the subject of an R.A.F. air mission to the Hedjaz. As I explained to you on the telephone this afternoon, I am afraid consideration of this proposal has had to give way to more urgent and weighty matters, such as our operations in Iraq and disarmament problems at Geneva* In fact, the outcome of Geneva disarmament proposals may considerably affect any air scheme which Ibn 3aud has in mind. The object of this note is, however, to let you know the reason for the delay, which is not that we are unsympathetic to Ibn Saud’s proposals, but due to the reasons above. A consideration of the first importance is, what does Ibn Saud ultimately went? Fuad Hamsa spoke of training, say, six pilots, nine fitters and nine riggers as a start, but to what end? Obviously it will be a waste of our and Hedjazi time and money to send out a small training mission with the limited object of training a few personnel on a School type unless suitable organisation is created for their immediate employment. Has Ibn Saud thought of this Esq. , Office, S.W.lIf this and what does he want to do with his trained airmen and mechanics? Does he contemplate building up a fighting unit which will ultimately be capable of expansion, or does he merely intend to have a small unit for communication purposes composed of some simple civil type of aircraft? In either event some organisation, and it will be expensive, is required. Moreover, once embarked upon, the air venture must proceed on sound and continuous lines. Interruption in flying or maintenance of the aircraft would inevitably bring about the rapid decay of both personnel and aircraft. It is, therefore, necessary that Ibn Saud should first make up his mind what he really wants. To my mind, if an official mission is to be considered, one of the criteria on which this decision will be taken is whether or not the mission has definite prospects of successfully carrying through its task, and this depends on whether Ibn Saud has a definite intention to create an air force on sound and progressive lines. I do not think, therefore, that we can give any useful consideration to the proposal until we know more definitely what Ibn Saud wants and, above all, that he has grasped the full significance of what an air force entails in its initial building up, its maintenance and its operation. Even the smallest fighting unit, i.e. one flight, is likely to cost - exclusive of accommodation, training mission and British advisers - approximately £50,000 Capital cost. £25,000 Recurring annual expenditure. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) W.A. McClaughry, P.S.Group Captain Peirse dictated this letter before going on leave and asked me to sign it for him.COPY. (E 3546/463/25). My dear Andrew, I enclose a copy of a letter from McClaughry of the Air Ministry which reached me at the same time as your personal letter of the 22nd JFune about the proposal for a Koyal Air Force Mission to the Hejaz-Nejd. We have been considerably impressed by the difficulties to which both you and McClaughry draw attention, and we are now inclined to doubt whether it is worth while going any further with the proposal. But we do not want, more especially in view of Ibn Baud’s Transjordan difficulties, to turn down the scheme summarily or tft give Ibn Baud the impression that we are unsympathetic# Will you therefore, unless you see serious objection, take a suitable opportunity of explaining to the Hejazis as fully and sympathetically as possible, that the question of Royal Air Force Mission, which was raised by Fuad Bey Hamza when he was over here with the Emir Feisal last May, has since been sympathetically and practically examined# You should then make such use as you can of the material contained in McClaughry’s letter as showing the result of that examination, which may be summed up as follows:- (a) it is impracticable for us to consider the matter further until Ibn Baud has made up his mind as to (l) the kind of air organisation he proposes to build up and (2) the purpose for which he needs it, and unless he is determined to see the matter through on the agreed/ FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l. 27th July, 1932. Sir Andrew Ryan, K.B.E., C.M.Gagreed plan once it has started: and (b) the cost of such an organisation, even on the most modest lines, will he enormous, at any rate far more than Ibn Saud can surely have contemplated. There are of course also other difficulties with which you are familiar - the difficulty of finding - and sparing - the right kind of men; that of arranging financial conditions (there is no hope now of any contribution from the Treasury), etc. etc. It is possible that, if you speak in the above sense, the Hejazis may realise the position and draw in their horns. V/e can in any case see what they reply. In the meantime you should promise them nothing - but if in spite of all this, any practicable scheme of helping the Hejazis can be devised, we shall be only too glad to reconsider the matter.

Mission:- I spoke to Fuad Hamza on August 11. 1 reminded him that he had broached the suggestion as one personal to him self for the time being. I said that it had therefore been dealt with in personal letters and that in yours to me you had asked me to make it clear that while drawing attention to difficulties, all concerned at home had approached the subject in a spirit of the greatest sympathy. 1 then gave fj him a memorandum which I had prepared merely as a convenient way of summing up the results of the examination at home for hil own information and that of the King, if he decided to pursue the matter. We did not discuss the memorandum which he took away to read at leisuree I think it is better to have something in writing ae a clear record of the position reached but my memorandum is in no sense an official note. I merely initialled and dated it and did not attach an Arabic translation as we do in the case of all formal communications. I referred lightly in the conversation to one point in McClaughry’s letter, viz., the possible effect on Ibn Baud’s plans of the outcome of the Disarmament Confermnee I could not quite understand one phrase in the letter viz., M exclusive/'•exclusive of accommodation, training mission and British 'advisers' out I hope that my rendering is sufficiently accurate. Faud expressed great appreciation of the care with which you and Peirse had studied the question. Spet&amp;ing more generally in the course of our interview, he expressed the utmost gratitude for the kindness that had heen shown in London, more particularly hy yourself, Oliphant and Warner. I promised to pass this on. I gather that he would in due course he writing letters to all of you. Yours ever, (Signed) Andrew Ryan.1 /*S OF WAD BEY In his Ccmversation with Mr» . ©ndel and Captain Feirse on May 13 &gt; Fuad Bey put Forward a personal suggestion that the British Government might reconsider the possibility of sending a Royal Air Force mission to train subjects of Ki^g Abdul &gt;i*iz as pilots and mechanics. The matter was briefly mentioned at an official meeting that afternoon, when Fuad Bey emphasized the personal character of the suggestion. 2. At the private meeting with Mr. Rendel and Captain Peirse Fuad Bey expressed the opinion that a mission consisting of one pilot instructor, one engineer instructor and four mechanics would suffice to train, say, six pilots, nine fitters and nine riggers and said that the Hejazi Government would be prepared to procure two instructional machines of an inexpensive type in view of the unsuitability of the wapitis for training purposes. 3. The Foreign Office and the Air Ministry have considered the matter with the greatest sympathy, and will consider it further if Fuad Bey or his Government wish to pursue it after studying the present memci'andum which explains various difficulties disclosed by the practical examination of the suggestion in London. 4. The authorities in England cannot disregard certain difficulties of a general kind. These may be summed up under the following headss- (a} The difficulty of finding suitable men for the work » and sparing them temporarily from the British service. The difficulty of choice is increased by the necessity of over coming the subsidiary difficulties presented by language, the climatic conditions of Hejaz-Nejd and the provision ofsuitable accommodation for the members of the mission, etc., etc., etc. It is recognised that the Hejazi Government would exert itself to overcome these subsidiary difficulties but Way require careful consideration beforehand. (b) The impossibility in present financial conditions and probably at any future time of obtaining any contribution from British Government sources towards the cost of the mission* which would be very heavy relatively to the financial resources Of 'the Hejazi Government. See paragraph 8 below. 5. The Air Ministry draw attention to more technical considerations. They also have studied the matter with great sympathy and express regret that it has taken some little time to do so owing to other preoccupations e.g., the Disarmament Conference. 6. The Ministry point out that it is a matter of the firs importance for the Hejazi Government to decide at the outset the exact nature of their ultimate oojective. It would be a mere waste of time and money to employ a mission to train the pero^nel mentioned by ^’uad Bey without having a clear conceptio: of the kind of organization in which the personnel were to be employed and oringing this organization into existence with a view to the immediate employment of the personnel trained by the mission. 7. In this connection the Ministry put the question whet the object would be to build up a fighting unit capable of uitxnste expansion or merely to create a small unit for communi cation purposes, using a simple type of aircraft. The organisa tion would have to be planned at the staict with reference to the ultimate requirements and any plan adopted would have to be adhered to and worked out on sound and continuous lines, i: the/the mission were to do useful work anu if the Hejazi Government were to avoid the danger of deterioration both of personnel aid aircraft which must result fromaiy interruption in flying or maintenance. 8. The Air Ministry feel ihat, if they are to pursue the matter usefully and heljfully, they ittust know definitely what is contemplated. They also draw attention to the importance of realizing the full significance of %ha* ir ertailed in the initial building up of an air force. They point out that in order to create even the smallest fighting unit i.e., one fligh , it would probably be necessary to undertake, in addition to the cost of accomodation, salaries of the mission and provision for the personnel to be trained, expenditure on approximately the following scales- Capital outlay, £50,000 Recurring annual expenditure, £25,000(i. 4237/463/25) FOH.'JQN OFUCK, 8.W. 1 7th Septeaher, 1932 De&amp;r Mr, Nornmn, You will reraember thet we corresponded in April last on the subject of* the possible sale of aircraft to the Persian Government.

Sir Andrew Ryan referred the enquiry to this department and after consultation with the Air Ministry, the High Commissioner at Cairo was requested to convey the reply to Miar Airwork.

It hod been arranged that Fned Bey Hamza should meet Group-Captain Peirae of the Air Ministry for an informal conversation regarding the question of the provision of emergency landing grounds on the Hose coast. Mr. Rendel, at the beginning of the interview, said that it was agreed that the conversation should be informal and without commitment on either side. After a discussion on various other questions, Fuad Bey Hamza said that he would like to make a purely personal suggestion that H.M.Government should reconsider their recent decision on the subject of assisting the Hejaz and Nejd Government in the development of their Air Force. The matter was discussed, and it was agreed that the principal difficulties were: (1) Financial; the difficulty of finding a competent personnel at the salaries offered; (2) The difficulty connected with the inability of H.M.Government to agree to ^ritiah subjects being employed to pilot Hejaz Nejd aeroplanes in the case of hostilities against a third country and in the case of operations fjj against rebels; end (3) The language difficulty. Finally, Fuad Buy asked that H.M.Government should consider again the possibility of sending a JR. A. F. mission to....to instruct subjects of the Hejaz and Nejd both as pilots and mechanics. He thought that the Nejd Government would like for a start to have, say, six pilots, nine fitters and nine riggers trained, and he suggested that for this purpose a training mission consisting of one pilot instructor, one engineer instructor and four mechanics would be adequate. It was pointed out to Fuad Bey that the Wapiti machines, which his government have, were unsuitable for training purposes and he said that they would be ready to acquire two training machines of an inexpensive type. Mr. Ren del said that he would report what Fuad Bey had said on this point and it would of course receive full consideration.

They consequently completed during the night of September 12th theft of 13,000 pounds worth of benzine from Cellatly Hankey and Company Limited comprising, the firm’s whole stock in government warehouse. Theft has probably been proceeding for some weeks but authorities have apparently been falsifying accounts and denying firm access to store on pleas of absence of store keeper and key at Taif so that discovery was only made yesterday morning after last big haul. I have male representations by telegraph. 3. Financial and moral depression are deepened by news (not yet officially confirmed) of still further advances by Imam and general expectation of open hostilities this week. 4. Situation is not improved by spectacular collapse of Hejaz air force just when needed. Lowe is ill and was dismissed last week as useless but police have orders not to allow him to leave Jedda tomorrow f l may have to telegraph separately on this subject). Syrian adventurer recently/recently engaged as pilot yesterday refused to fly &amp;iid as been flogged and jailed; French Charge d’Affaires no^ intervening. Turkish pseudo-mechanic has escaped into his legation after mauling by Fejdi garrison. German pilot (Sir A.

It will be observed that the Government of India still adhere to tiie views which they expressed in their telegram No.2219-S of the 15th July (copy of which was enclosed L in the letter from this Department No.P.4718/29 of the 19th July 1929) - namely that thereuls a real risk that participation^ of non-Muslim British personnel’in boipbing operations in the Jazirat - ul - Arab might lend itself to dangerous propaganda, especially in Muslim India; that this risk, if unavoidable that should be faced^ but/if there was any likelihood of such personnel being called upon to bomb within the Hejaz itself the risk was too serious to be faced. The Government Oi India’s present ^elegram,however , suggests/ ?suggests that further efforts should be made to provide British personnel if His Majesty’s Government are satisfied that the original considera tions which inducedthem to supply the necessary foreign element in the Hejaz Air Force still apply. 3. The Government of India’s telegram was of course sent before they were aware of the views expressed in the Air Ministry’s letter No. S.30607/S.6. to the Foreign Office The Secretary of State for India is prima facie inclined to agree that for the reasons stated in that letter any further attempt at present to supply freslp personnel for the Hejaz Air Ferce is only likely to result in loss of prestige ( and in the long run to diminish rather than to increase British influence in the Hejaz. If, attd in so far as, this % view is accepted by His Majesty’s Government^it would appear that the original considerations postulated in para. 2 of the Government of India’s telegram no longsr apply at any rate with the same force as they had in 1929. 4. Copies of this letter are being sent to the Air Ministry and the Colonial Office.gf &lt;) A jgs/rtj/dt.

I brought to the knowledge of Hie Me Jest/ the Ong the content a of 70 ur Mete Ho* 179 of the $Gth September on the matter of the engagement of the airmen needed for the air force in thie country. Hia Majesty waa much griered by the contents of this Note and ordered me to remind you that we did not buy the aeroplanes with the Intention of warring against anyone and that we only have neighbours with whom we desire that there shall always be a state of peaoe between us and them. Per we bought them for operations against those of our own subjects who disobeyed us and secondly to repulse any more that anyone might make against us, but ms hawe not been able to profit from the aeroplanes In the time of need by reason of the airmen that were. We only entrusted to ths British ftovsrnaent the procuring of airmen for us beoause of our ardent desire for that Corernment'a pre-emlnenoe and to make closer our friendship. $e did not bear the expense of them In order that, when we needed them, they should offer ▼arious excuses but we gained no profit from them and it is not hidden from you that this is impossible and cannot be aooeptsd. We now find it neoessary to punish certain subjects, so let the British Gonrsrnment choose one of two courses, either to send us airmen and moohanlcB or engineers sufficient for four aeroplanes and let them be under our authority for every purpose, or else send us engineers and instructors and we will ourselves/ouraelTes look frr airman other than sn»Liah ana the ’n«Ueh will be for trolnlng and the other# for Jar.

In reply to note based on your telegram No.132, Fuad has written letter private and urgent conveying message from King. Latter is much grieved and after lengthy display of pacific intentions, disappointment at ^ ^personnel, and firm friendship, states that he now finds it necessary to punish certain subjects and asks Kis Majesty’s Government to choose one of two courses: either send pilots and mechanics enough for four machines to he under his 7 pv* orders for every ournose or send instruction and mechanics and let him find non-British pilots - i.e* British for training, others for war. Fuad asks for full reply as soon as possible. Provided that you have no objection on principle to second course and that conditions and uncertainty of pay are acceptable ( I cannot hope to remedy either) I suggest expressing willingness to seek forthwith engineer instructor officer* and two mechanics, plus chief pilot Inst,rue tor when Hejaz Government buy instructional machine; the whole on the understanding that clauses 8 and 9 ofof draft contracts are replaced ty w employd vd.ll not te required for any warlike service his duties being confined to instruction maintenance 1(C) and repair at base aero drome1*6. is omitted, '‘Civil” inserted before 'aviation” at E. or F, and last two sentences of pilots, clause G. are inserted tfo r* in engineer’s contract prefaced by ' in absence of chief pilot instructor', omitting phrase from 'accompaniod' to 'instructor' and inserting 'native' before 'authority' and words 'to British personnel' after J If you approve I would ask Fuad to come here to agree to revised drafts and understandings enumerated in your despatch 382.CfiPY (E 4904/50/25) IT o • 5 D 3. / * &gt; r&gt; ^ J5:dda, 4th September, 1931. s My Lord, 7/ith further reference to Your 5^ Lordship T s telegram ITo.126 of September 1st, regarding the Hejazi Air Force, I have the honour to inform you that the Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs himself raised the three subsidiary points which concern the discipline, drinks, and regular payment of such new British personnel as may be engaged. 2. He stated that he had referred all three ooints to Ibn Sa T ud, who had replied (l) that matters of discipline among the suoordinate ranks and the relations of the Ohief Pilot with his superiors v/ere of purely domestic concern; (2j that he could not allow any arrangements whereby the new personnel should procure supplies of alcoholic liquor; and (3) that the question of failure to pay their salaries when due did not arise, since fne terms oj. tneir contracts would be faithfully observed. 3. As regards (l), Fuad Bey added his personal view that it would be useless to hedge the new personnel about with understandings as to their relations with the Hejazi officers and authorities with whom they would be in contact. .Then pressed, he frankly stated that these v/ere quite untrustworthy to fulfil any such undertakings, and instanced namdi Bey, His Majesty 1 s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.Bey, the present Chief of Military Organisation, as an inveterate intriguer. I suggest that an article exacting internal discipline he inserted in the draft contracts of all subordinate personnel. The relations of the Chief Pilot with his immediate and ultimate superiors will inevitably largely depend on his own personality. 4. With regard to (2), Fuad Bey stated that the King was adamant. As to (3), he advanced the personal view that only after the employee concerned should have made every effort to obtain payment of nis salary, including aopeal to the King, could this Legation be considered to have any right to intervene on his behalf. 5. Mr.Lowe sought my assistance a month ago in obtaining two months arrears of salary. As he had mada no approach to higher authority, I advised him to write officially to the Viceroy and personally to Fuad Bey, and promised my support if he achieved no result after a reasonable lapse of time. He has since received official notification, a translation of which I nave the honour to enclose, to the effect that it is not desired to renew his contract. He nevertheless seems anxious to do so and Fuad Bey informed me on September 2nd that he had in fact made a v/orking agreement with Hamdi Bey for continued service. Fuad Bey added that the central Government, however, had as yet nad nothing to do with it, and that any such agreement would have to terminate before the arrival of new personnel.1 4 6. I now await the reply to Sir A.Ryan 1 s Note of July 7th, which Fuad Bey h-.s undertaken to make without delay. Apart from the substance of my telegram No.195 of to-day, he would make no pronouncement. I have, etc., (Sd. ) C. G-. HOPE JILL.COPY No. 603/902.

This is maximum estimate. If discounted by half, his problems are still formidable and cumulative. To meet them he has unimpaired military prestige, much diminished political prestige,abated V/ahabi fervour behind him and no money. 2.

If pilots were used effectively against enemy or rebels in operations where Ibn Saud is suspected of having his back to the wall they might De feflturecl as hlred assassins in Moslem press no longer favourable to great Wahabi consolidation a dsn,Arabia - with repercussions in India. 5.

This may afford further justification if required for Lowe’s refusal to go to Asir.In any further comni«hcation on tttis subject, please quote ^huyoil fwZb' and address —not to any person by narke, but to— “ The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W. i. ,i 6912 4i (v f rs presents his THE Under-Secretary of mI niin Uj|| AITtii compliments to thl W-x and, by direction of the Secretary of State, transmits herewith cop /Q of the under-mentioned paper. ^44- Foreign Office, 'btL , 1931 . *r-' ]4_ 5 iSo (2)4 [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and should be / returned to the Foreign Office if not required for official use.] ' ^ FROM 5 912 1951 ^ I?Q DISTHIBUTION.

Hejazi Government notified Lowe on August 6th uhat they did not intend to renew his contract, he was re- luctant to lose paying job and though contractual leave began August 15th he eventually negotiated with lirmai Bey twelve months agreement terminable at one month by either side. He informed member of my staff later. For some months he has been under treatment for ear trouble. This becoming acute at the moment when macr.ines were required for Asir he was savagely accused of malinger ing. In reply to request for sick leave in dryer climate and to consult specialist supported by Legation doctors certificate, he was order to prepare himself and machines for active service. In highly nervous state he sought my intervention on September 6th. After receiving from the doctor con firmation of ill health, I spoke to Fuad at Tail. As a result Lowe asked on two following days icr ofiicia-*. medical examination which was refused. To this news Fuad replied that the Government had decided to cancel new agreement and repeated the statement two days later adding chat Lowe was free to leave. me •.. •2 . The contrary was the case in Jedc.a and although verbally dismissed by Hamdi Bey, Lov/e is under police surveillance and has tv/ice been refused Governor's visa for exit. This morning Fuad was excited. He insisted that K Lowe must stay for enquiry into yesterday’s crash. I naturally (?disagreed). He denied the right- of mine to intervene (I holding that Lowe thus dismissed is no longer Government employee) and stated that Government would retain him as many months as they wished men tioning proper handing over as one reason. This would be a farce and mean interminable delays. Lowe is un doubtedly ill and should go by boat September 20th. I expect Puad on September 17th. Do you approve my maintaining the right of inter vention to secure his departure^ It will oe dix^iouj-t in the present atmosphere owing to political effect of departure of last British pilot at critical moment. I should be grateful for some indication as to lengths to which I may go.COPY. (E 4478/50/25) Extract from memorandum of August 28th by Sir A. ityan, Proposed new arrangements for the Eejaz Air Force. I see that I did not report home my conversation with Fuad Bey Hamza when I delivered my note of July 7th (enclosed in E 3896) the reason being that I expected an early reply and hoped to be able to bring the whole matter up to date before leaving Jedda on July 19th. Contrary to my expectation the Hejazi Government made no further move up to that date. It is possible that this was owing to Ibn Saud T s absence in Nejd. It is also possible, however, that for financial and other reasons they preferred to go slow. They may even have been playing with the idea of extemporizing a local organisation, some of the elements in which they already had e.g. a Syrian of some experi ence as I understood. When I left, it did not looh as though was cast for a r3le in any such plan, as he was so complete ly ,T fed up' that he actually consulted the Legation a few days before as to how he should proceed to get paid off and clear out. To return to my conversation with Fuad Bey on or about July 7th:- We ran through the points in the memorandum enclosed with my note of July 7th. Fuad Bey expressed personal views pending consultation in Mecca. He agreed, as regards 1 (a),that special aircraft would be required for training purposes. He was vague about 1(b), being inclined to minimize the difficulty of giving instruction through interpreters both in this case and that of the proposed mission to be trained abroad. He concurredconcurred in 1(c) without apparently grasping all its implications. As regards (2), he said it was fully intended ^ that the engineering expert should be of officer status and seemed to realise that a competent man would have to be well paid. As regards (2) he thought that the contracts should be similar to those made with the original personnel. As regards (4) Fuad Bey was clearly very averse from the idea that the despatch of the mission should be delayed. I gathered that the Hejazis had in some way committed themselves to the despatch of the mission at an early date. (it is possi ble, though this did not emerge from my conversation with Fuad Bey, that this has something to do with an alleged plan of the King’s to re-employ Faudhi Bey, the late Director General of Military Organization and to send him abroad to be trained in aeronautics, rather than let him carry out a proposal that he should enter the Iraq service, as a consequence of his resigna tion or dismissal from his present post in the Hejaz. This Faudhi is intelligent and ambitious. Ee has a certain pull, despite his breach with the King over the regular army and might well hope to get the Air Force into his hands in due course). After discussing the contents of my note on the above lines, I spoke to Fuad Bey explicitly about the points that I was authorised to raise less formally. I emphasised the necessity for the punctual payment of salaries. In view of recent exchange conditions I added that they should be payao^e in gold. I hinted pretty plainly, without labouring the point, that while the Legation would not be concerned with the administration of the reinstructed Air norce, I should feel I had a right to intervene, if the payment of salaries were unduly delayed, as it had too often been in the past. Fuad suggested7 suggested indignantly that if the personnel were not paid in accordance with their contracts, they could get redress by applying to the proper quarter. This of course is absurd and I said so as plainly as I could without being rude. I said, without going into details, that I attached real importance to the question of finding means to enable the new personnel to obtain reasonable supplies of alcoholic liquor. I emphasized the necessity for a clear understanding that the Chief Pilot's authority should be maintained and that all instructions etc. should go through him. Fuad Bey noted these three points for consideration. It is clear from what precedes that, while Fuad Bey was on the whole personally in favour of meeting the formal desiderata of the Air Ministry as regards the new personnel and did not rule out the further suggestions made by me orally, something was holding up the decision of his Government - either finance, or a disposition to make other arrangements independ ently of His Majesty's Government or perhaps only the general semi-paralysis from which the administration was suffering after the King went to Nejd. As over six weeks have now elapsed since I wrote my note, I think it would be a good thing to enquire by telegraph of Mr. Hope Gill, who was present at my conversation with Fuad Bey, how the matter stands.

Your Royal Highness, After Compliments, With reference to Your Royal Highness’ notes Noe. 3/2/30 and 3/2/33 of June 17th relative to arrangements for the future of the Hejaz Air Force, I have the honour to state that His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom are prepared to take urgent steps to select the new personnel indicated in the second of these notes. They wish, however, to draw attention to certain points which seem to require elucidation before action can be taken. I enclose a memorandum in which I have summed up the views of the Air Ministry and I should be glad to receive at the earliest convenience of Your Royal Highness a further statement of the views of Your Government. I should be glad to learn in particular whether you agree as regards points 2 and 3 in the memorandum. You will also doubtless give consideration to the other points which need careful examination in the interest of the Hejazi Government. There are two or three other points of a less technical nature affecting the conditions of service of the nei personnel. I would propose to discuss these orally with His Excellency Fuad Bey Hamza during his present stay in Jedda. With highest respects, The Minister for Foreign Affaire,MEMORANDUM SHEWING THE VIEWS OF THE AIR MINISTRY ON THE ARRANGEMENTS PROPOSED FOR THE FUTURE FORKING OF THE HEJAZ /IR FORCE. 1. (a). It is apparently intended that the pilot and engineering expert should train Arab pilots and mechanics, such training cannot at the outset be given on Wapitis which machines of a service type and require trained pilots. (b) . For air training or anything more than the most elementary instruction in engineering the pupils would need to have a knowledge of English. (c) . In any case personnel now proposed would have to f devote all their time to the present aircraft, 6f the aeroplanes are to be maintained in service condition and used even for limited flying. 2 . The Ministry consider that the engineering expert should be of officer status. In order to attract a man of sufficient experience, the Air Ministry would need to be able to offer any salary up to that paid to the Chief idiot. 3. In order to expedite the departure of the new staff from England, it is suggested that the draft contracts should be sent by the Foreign Office to this Legation for the approval of the Hejazi Government and that, on receipt of their telegraphic approval, the actual contracts should be signed in London in duplicate by the Minister of Rejaz-Nejd and the selected persons. 4. The Ministry strongly advise that the question of sending a mission to England to be trained should be allowed to stand over until after the arrival of the new personnel. The senior members of the latter could then obtain particular as to the Hejazi Government’s programme of air development and advise accordingly on the most practical form to give tothe arrangements for and the composition of a mission, having regard to such questions as e*g., the proportion of persons to he trained as pilots and mechanics respectively and the language difficulty* BRITISH LEGATION, JEDDA, July 7th, 1931.Jo.sea.

I am to suggest, however, that although it is desired that one of the Pilots to be engaged should be specially qualified as Air Instructor, it should be made quite clear to the Hedjaz Government that it will not be possible for him to give any 'ab initio' training on the type of aeroplane they now possess, viz., the 'Wapiti' which is a service type. Further, that the new personnel can only be considered as the minimum necessary to maintain the present aircraft in a serviceable state' for very limited flying. 2 . With reference to the last paragraph of Jeddah telegram Ho. 172, I am to state that the Air Council are un certain as to the precise status of the six persons the Hedjaz Government propose should be trained in England, but they assume the proposal refers to officer cadets for training as Pilots. In any event, I am to suggest that it would be better policy to defer any Question of this nature until after the arrival in the Hedjaz of the new British personnel for the following reasons:- Dhe Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office, S.W.l.(a) Before undertaking the training of Hedjazi personnel, it is considered very desirable that the Senior Pilot in charge of the British personnel should ascertain as precisely as possible the scheme of development Ibn Saua y has tin mind in regard to his Air Force• By so doing he would then be in a position to submit advice to the Hedjaz Government as to the most practical method of giving effect to the scheme. For example, to undertake the training of six Hedjaz Pilots now, without making any provision for the training of a suitable number of mechanics would be ^nost impractical and short sighted policy. (b) The question of where the Hedjaz Pilots and Mechanics are to be trained should also be carefully considered. Provided there were no political objection it appears to the Council that it would probably be in most respects more suitable •for them to be trained at the Royal Air Force School in Egypt rather than in England. This proposal would have the farther advantage of reducing the cost of passages. (c) In regard to training generally the language difficulty should be made very clear, especially in regard to the training of pilots, as the services of an interpreter would not overcome the difficulty during training in the air. » As a first step it might well be desirable to have selected personnel taught English. 3* Should their views regarding the training of Hedjaz t personnel prove acceptable, the Air Council would arrange to furnish the Senior British Pilot with all available data before he leaves England so that he would be in s position, after his f # t arrival at Jeddah and when he has had sufficient time to appreciate the local situation, to submit a detailed Ibn Saud for his consideration. 4. Finally I am to state that the agreement with Sir A.Ryan's suggestion as to employ in regard to raising the points 9 (3) to (5) of his despatch Bo. 129.

I informed Fuad hy letter on June 6th. .Meanwhile difficulty has arisen over Morris. Fuad wrote on June 3rd that in the absence of detailed list of accessories originally supplied commission could not be sure that Morris was handing over all that he had received. Fuad asked for my advice as he did not see how Morris could leave pending settlement. He als* asks me to obtain detailed specification of original material. Morris tells me that when material reached Darin he checked and initialled vouchers accompanying each consignment and passed them to Qusaibi for signature. He kept unofficial record of original supplies but being his own store keeper he did not write off spare parts etc. withdrawn for use. Supply of these was estimated for 6 months and has naturally been almost exhausted. I pointed out to Fuad that reason why lists were not available in Mecca was that Qusaibi did not send vouchers to ultimate authority responsible for Air force viz. Amir Faisal and said that consumption of spares v*' - had not naturally been heavy. I suggested it would be unreasonable to detain Morris and that government should accept suitable certificate from him in general terms. Government have rejected my suggestion. They insist that Morris must submit list of spares issuedIand damaged whereupon they will (? gp. omt.) Qusaihi and then arrange about Morris' departure. It is unfortunate that Morris did not keep detailed record. Nevertheless I consider attitude of government unreasonable and vexatious in the circumstances. They are holding up both pilots' pay. I need your support for further action. May I have early instructions as the icing again contemplates visit to Jedda. I suggest if I cannot bring government around quickly I should be authorised to say:- (a) That I cannot act as intermediary after the flat rejection of my advice. (b) That as Commission has taken delivery His Majesty’s Government reserve the right to intervene officially on Morris' behalf and to claim compensation if he is not paid and allowed to leave. ('R' ends). You may Hue to add that His Majesty's Government will have nothing to do with question of new staff if Hcjat government persist in putting indignity on responsible officer recommended by them. I am between two minds about this; it would sound like threat but would be ineffective as such unless Ibn Saud is really sincere in his desire for British assistance.(E 3066/50/25). NO DISTRIBUTION .

Nos. 149 and 150. R begins: - My telegram No. 133. In personal letter of May 19th Fuad reminds me of our conversations and refers to insistence by Morris and. North of maintaining their resignations with view to immediate departure. He says aeroplanes have been neglected for some time owing to lack of mechan ics and that this nas compelled Hejaz government to press question of new staff. After furtner rather confusing comments (including reference to tne probable desire of government to make use of aeroplanes) he announces decision to accept resignations ol Morris and North and to instruct them ‘go hand over material in their charge to a committee including one person with mechanical knowledge and knowledge of aeroplanes. Hejaz government urgently beg His Majesty’s Government to arrange matter as scon as possible so that aer.plane, may not suffer from neglect and misuse. Fuad asks for my assistance and it is probable that sanction will soon be given for formalities of hsnding over. Two days after above was written Morris received letter from Hamdi Bey to the effect that commission consistingconsisting of himself Lowe and three others had been instructed by the King to take delivery of aeroplanes. hnd of xh Hamdi was officer commanding here and has just been appointed director-general of military ? K~* t fc+lls organisation. I misunderstood him and believe him to have been concerned in intrigues surrounding disintegration of Air Force in December. Insistence of Hejaz government is unreason able as they have ignored my advice since February and persistently hope to get good men at lower salaries in spite of your clear statement that it is impossible. Nevertheless if it is still object of policy to maintain British character of force I think we should show utmost readiness to help them on practical lines as expeditiously as possible. It is unfo'rtunate that Lowe - should be member of commission to take over material, but if Morris and North go he is the only man available with technical knowledge. It is probably now too late to attempt ( gr. omtd.) on lines of last paragraph of my telegram No. 133, but it might possibly be done if I could act immediately and add inducement of loan of two or three Royal Air Force mechanics until expiration of present contract of Morris and North.I- ionr.

The inability of the Hejazi Government to make up its mind has complicated matters.

Rumours of this got about and the desire to resign rather than be dismissed, together with the fact that Mr.Lowe had not yet been dismissed, 1 eventually caused Messrs.Morris and North to tender their resignations. The//V mm *T' X -(— Uw The latest telegram shows that the King is pressing (P.Z.2768) for an answer to his request to H.M.G. for a new staff and meanwhile trying to get Messrs .Morris and North to stay on. It is not quite clear whether Lowe has been definitely dismissed yet or not. Possibly the King wants to make sure at any rate one man remaining on N till the new staff arrives. The Air Ministry have replied to the 'Foreign Office (P.Z.2821) that they insist on Lowe’s removal from the Hejaz and are unable to consider lower rates of pay for the new personnel. It looks as if the King will comply with both requests without delay: otherwise if Messrs. Morris and North insist on departing at once, he may be left stranded. Sir A. Ryan in his despatch of April 4th (P.Z.2768) makes one or two suggestions for the contracts of the new staff. Apparently the payment of the present pilot’s salaries has not been very regular. (Also the Air Ministry are right in saying that the present rate of £1000 per annum (cf. P.5841/29) could certainly hardly be reduced in view of the dangers and difficulties of the post)• It now appears that Lowe is not so bad as he was originally thought. ’’He is probably as good a pilot as either of them and more enterprising: but he suffers from all sorts of queer complexes and drinks to excess on occasion”. ’’While condemning his attitude, I am not sure that he was solely responsible for the deplorable situation wnich srose last spring'.

I suggested it would be difficult lO ask ..'.orris and North to stay on temporarily merely to hand over to new men when they had resigned in order to avoid humiliation of being dismissed.

Dear Sir Andrew Ryan, With reference to my verbal conversation with Your Excellency in the matter of the British employees we have in the air force and who were chosen 'by the British Government to serve in our air force at the request of our Government, I have received the final instructions concerning them and I now write this letter to ash Your Excellency to communicate to the British Government our desire to dispense with all other employees re maining in the air force at present 'because they have not proved to 'be a united hody good for their work, and their conduct re sulted in a 'breakdown of the air force which has now 'become useless for work. I therefore shall 'be glad if you will be good enough to submit to the British Government our desire to have a similar number (of new employees) for the air torce in place of the first ones but at lower rates than those agreed upon with the previous employees, for those rates are considered by the Government to be too high particularly during the present economical crisis. I hope to receive lour Excellency s reply to this at the earliest convenience. With highest respects, Yours sincerely, (Signed) YUSSUF YA3IN.— Kj5|' • - Ho. 596/35/14. 1 SKCRjT. '* ■ '' ' (K 1608/50/26) My dt^ar George, This is thu full explanation regarding the Hejaz Air Force situation promised in my telegram No. 59 of today’s date. When I broachvd the subject with Yusuf Yasin early in February he told me that he had heard the King instruct the Emir Faisal to speak to me about it. Nothing came of this at that time, perhaps because of the Emir’s breakdown in health. Your telegra No.50 of February 20 decided me to go d finitely into the whole matter when the King came to Jedda. I did so with Yusuf Yasin on February 25. I took a strong anti-Lowe line but based it mainly on the fact that Lowe’s general attitude has been contrary to all the ideas of discipline and officer-spirit which should prevail in a British-staffed force. The reason for taking this line was that, since the mechanics left, there has been nothing openly reprehensible in Lowe’s general conduct although his conduct as an officer of the Air-Force before the mechanics went and on at least one occasion since has been such as to make him an undesirable element. Yusuf Y sin paid a tribute to the efforts /ofof Hie Majesty’s Government to help Ibn Sa’ud but ^' said that the personnel had nevertheless proved unsatisfactory and the members of the force could not work together. The King wanted to get rid of all of them and wanted the assistance of His Majesty’s Government in getting a completely new staff, which he thougnt he should be able to do at lower salaries. He did not, however, want to discharge all three pilots simultaneously, as he must have some one to look aftmr the machines. His plan was to accept any resignations and hang on for the time being to anyone who did not resign. Yusuf Yasin begged me not to reveal the King’s intentions to the pilots, lest they should all go before the King had had time to make new arrangements. I promised to treat what he had told me as confidential but pointed out the weak points of the plan. The result would be that Morris and North would resign, as they would no longer work with Lowt; and Lowe, the undesirable, would remain. Secondly, I sugg sted that it would be a mistake to scrap Morris and North, who at least know the aeroplanes and conditions. I asked Yusuf Yasin to take further instructions and we agreed that I should not report to the Foreign Office until he had done so. I mentioned the matter to Ibn Sa’ud personally on March 4 but he preferred to send me a message by Yusuf Yasin. The matter each to see me on March 5 and told me that the King had decided (a) to get rid of Lowe; (b) to keep Morris and North for the duration of their contracts but not longer; and(c) to ask His Majesty’s Government to help him to g t a complete new staff i.e. four pilots and six mechanics on cheaper terms. I promised to submit (c) for consideration. Yusuf Vasin*s assurance oe regards (a) was not entirely explicit. I said that it would be much easier for His Majesty’s Government to help, if they knew that Lowe had been eliminated. I told Morris in due course as much as I could do without breaking my promise to treat what I had been told of the intentions of the King in regard to him and North as confidential. He told me on March 7 that they would be prepared to stay if Lowe went. I suggested that they should now wait say a week and see what happened. I do not consider that Morris and North will have any grievance if they art allowed to serve out their contracts and are then asked to go. They are quite nice fellows but they have not the personality for a show of this kind. It needs a Chief Pilot of quite exceptional quality, as regards ability to impose hims- If both on the authorities and the force. Lowe, though I still do not know him, is probably as good a pilot as either of them and more enterprising; but he suffers from all sorts of queer complexes and drinks to excess on occasion. His proneness to intrigue with subordinate native officers, about which I spoke forcible to Yusuf Yasin, is also against him. I have surrounded my intervention with all /necessarynecessary precautions and am fairly well satisfied with the result so far* It is now up to the Air Ministry to see what they can make of the situation. Yours ever, (Sgd) AUDREW RYAN*</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000555.0x0001e8_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/1950</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x0001e8</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/1950</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 5/5 ‘Arabia: Hejaz Air Force; Recruitment of personnel by HMG; Instruction of Hejazi pilots’</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1931/1939</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2016-12-20T23:32:33</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (350 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the main foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1 and terminates at the last folio with 350; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located at the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.

The file covers some of the consequences resulting from the failure to reach an agreement on this issue.Much of the rest of the file focuses on various proposals for providing assistance to the Hejaz (later Saudi) Government such as: the provision of a British Air Mission, the appointment of a Muslim Air Adviser (from either Egypt, Iraq, or India), the supply of aircraft and equipment, and various suggestions for training pilots and mechanics at Royal Air Force institutions. These proposals are discussed in terms of their practicality, and their financial and political feasibility.The file also contains some discussion related to the following: a proposal from Misr Airwork for a demonstration of the Avro 626 to the Hejaz Government; a Turkish military mission in Saudi Arabia; an Italian Air Mission to Saudi Arabia; and a proposal to supply arms and ammunition to Saudi Arabia. It also has extracts from
                           The Timesnewspaper dated 27 April 1933 (folio 143) and 12 February 1937 (folio 124);
                           The Evening Standarddated 25 November 1931 (folio 207); and an extract from the
                           Umm-al-Quradated 16 September 1932 (folio 151).The main correspondents are as follows: HM Minister at Jeddah (Andrew Ryan and Reader William Bullard), HM Chargé d’Affaires at Jeddah (Cecil Gervase Hope-Gill), officials at the Air Ministry, and officials at the Foreign Office. Much of the file consists of correspondence forwarded from the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to the Under-Secretary of State for India, in order to inform India Office officials of developments in Arabia.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year.
