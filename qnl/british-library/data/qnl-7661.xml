[Cd. 3750.] Price l±d.Convention signed on August 31, 190/, between Great Britain and Russia, containing Arrangements on the subject of Persia, Afghanistan, and Thibet. No. 1. Sir Edward Grey to Sir A. Nicolson. gi r Foreign Office, August 29, 1907. I HAVE to-day authorized your Excellency by telegraph to sign a Convention with the Russian Government containing Arrangements on the subject of Persia, Afghanistan, and Thibet. The Arrangement respecting Persia is limited to the regions of that country touching the respective frontiers of Great Britain and Russia in Asia, and the Persian Gulf is not part of those regions, and is only partly in Persian territory. It has not therefore been considered appropriate to introduce into the Convention a positive declaration respecting special interests possessed by Great Britain in the Gulf, the result of British action in those waters for more than a hundred years. His Majesty’s Government have reason to believe that this question will not give rise to difficulties between the two Governments should developments arise which make further discussion affecting British interests in the Gulf necessary. For the Russian Government have in the course of the negotiations leading up to the conclusion of this Arrangement explicitly stated that they do not deny the special interests of Great Britain in the Persian Gulf—a statement of which His Majesty’s Government have formally taken note. In order to make it quite clear that the present Arrangement is not intended to affect the position in the Gulf, and does not imply any change of policy respecting it on the part of Great Britain, His Majesty’s Government think it desirable to draw attention to previous declarations of British policy, and to reaffirm generally previous statements as to British interests in the Persian Gulf and the importance of maintaining them. His Majesty’s Government will continue to direct all their efforts to the preserva tion of the status quo in the Gulf and the maintenance of British trade; in doing so, they have no desire to exclude the legitimate trade of any other Power. I am, &amp;c. (Signed) E. GREY. No. 2. Sir A. Nicolson to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received September 3.) St. Petersburgh, August 31, 1907. I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith the Convention which was signed to-day by M. Isvolsky and myself for the settlement of certain questions affecting the interests of Great Britain and Russia in Asia. I also beg leave to forward a note which I received from M.
