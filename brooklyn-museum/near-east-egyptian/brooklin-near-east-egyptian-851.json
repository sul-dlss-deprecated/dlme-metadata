They refrained from excess, choosing simple, clean forms and understated color patterns. For instance, unlike flamboyant examples from the later New Kingdom, Middle Kingdom necklaces were usually monochromatic and almost never included beads of more than three colors. The most expensive jewelry featured beads made of gold; because it never tarnishes, gold was called the &ldquo;flesh of the gods&rdquo; and conveyed immortality. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nJewelers of the Middle Kingdom also relied on certain attractive semiprecious stones that had appeared only sporadically in the Old Kingdom. Red carnelian represented blood&rsquo;s life-giving properties, and green turquoise symbolized vegetation and fertility and thus resurrection. Purple amethyst and pale blue anhydrite, however, seem to have had no magical powers and were admired solely for their visual appeal.<br />", "summary": "", "rank": 0, "label_date": "2016-03-01", "date_added": "2016-04-04 20:04:08", "approved_for_web": 1}], "artists": [], "collections": [{"id": 5, "name": "Egyptian, Classical, Ancient Near Eastern Art", "folder": "egyptian", "rank": 0}], "exhibitions": [{"id": 648, "title": "Egypt Reborn: Art for Eternity"}, {"id": 3329, "title": "Ancient Egyptian Art"}], "related_items": [{"accession_number": "26.46", "object_id": 3294}, {"accession_number": "26.159", "object_id": 3296}, {"accession_number": "26.161", "object_id": 3298}, {"accession_number": "51.226", "object_id": 3566}], "geographical_locations": [{"id": 7125930, "name": "Abydos, Egypt", "type": "Place excavated"}], "videos": [], "images": [{"filename": "CUR.26.160_erg2.jpg", "id": 79438, "standard_size_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size2/CUR.26.160_erg2.jpg", "thumbnail_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size0_sq/CUR.26.160_erg2.jpg", "derivatives": [{"size": "0", "width": 72, "height": 96}, {"size": "1", "width": 144, "height": 192}, {"size": "2", "width": 288, "height": 384}, {"size": "3", "width": 576, "height": 768}, {"size": "4", "width": 1152, "height": 1536}], "largest_derivative_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size4/CUR.26.160_erg2.jpg", "largest_derivative": "4", "description": null, "caption": " <em>Necklace</em>, ca. 1938-1759 B.C.E.
