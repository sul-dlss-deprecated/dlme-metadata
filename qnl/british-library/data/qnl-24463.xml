I have the honor to transmit, for the information of His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General of India in Council, the Administra tion Report of the Persian Gulf Political Residency, including the Muscat Political Agency for the year 1875-76. 2. The Administration Report is divided into the following parts :— I.—General Report of the Persian Gulf Political Residency, drawn up by Lieutenant-Colonel E. C. Ross. II.—Report on the Province of Ears and its dependencies, accom panied by a sketch map, by Lieutenant-Colonel E. C. Ross. III.—Trade Returns of Bushire and the Persian Gulf.

I regret that official changes at the various ports have retarded the submission of this Report, and that this cause has prevented me from obtaining any trade statistics of the Port of Bunder Abbass. 4. I request that I may be supplied with a few printed copies of the Report for future reference and record.^ ii „ gulf political residency 2 administration report of tiil per.- i - Part I. ADMINISTRATION REPORT FOR 187o-7G. General. The several Governments, Chiefdoms, and territories generally, which may he noticed in connection w.th the Political charge are, tor convenience o£ reference, classihed as follows. 1. Oman—Under Sultan of Muscat. 2. Oman—Petty independent Chiefdoms. 3. Islands of Balirein. 4. Nejd and El Katr (Gnttur). 5. Bassadore (Busiduh) British. 6. Government of Ears (Shiraz). The portion of the Report referring to the Sultanate of Muscat has been prepared by the Political Agent at Muscat, Oman. Muscat. The narrative of the political events of the year will be found, as usual, unfortunately full of interest. _ I will only observe that throughout the several important crises which have had place, the Political Agent has maintained strict neutrality, and with the cordial aid and support of the Royal Navy Commanders suc cessfully arranged for the protection of British interests. Petty Chiefdoms. Oman Coast. The places referred to under this heading are the townships situated on what is known as the Pirate Coast (now quite a misnomer), the Sheikhs or Chiefs of which have engaged themselves to the British Government to observe the terms of the maritime truce. These trucial Chiefs are— 1. Hameyd bin Abdullah of the tribe El Kowasim or Jowasim, township Ras-ul-Khaimah. 2. Ahmed bin Abdullah of the tribe Al-bu-Ali, township Umm-al- Gawain (Amulgavine). 3. Eashid bin Hameyd of the^ tribe Al-bu-Ali, township Ajman. 4. Salim bin Sultan bin Suggur of the tribe El Kowasim, township Shargah. r 5. Hashar bin Muktum of the tribe Al-bu-Falesah, township Dabai r71 v 6 - Zaeed bin Khalifah of the tribe Beni-Yas, township Abu Zhabi. Besides the above there is on the same coast the township of Himreeyah the Chief of which is Seif bin Abdool Rahman. This place was originally a dependency of Shargah but has seceded, and the Sheikh is jwrm-independent.and muscat political agency for the year 1875-76. 3 This situation has caused some difficulty in tlie adjustment of old standing 1 claims and counter-claims. On the coast of El Katr (Guttur) there is a settlement of the Beni- Yas at Khor Odeyd under Sheikh Baty bin Khadim. These settlers seceded several years a^o from Ahu /^habi, and the (^hief of the lattci place has ever since burned to attack Odeyd and reduce the settlers to submission to his authority. Permission to proceed by sea has however been refused, and the land route along the coast is impracticable. Last year it was reported that hostilities were still going on by land between the rival Chiefdoms. I am happy to state that during the past year the differences have been arranged and peace established. In the month of November I visited the Chiefs and made them the customary presents in token of satisfaction with their behaviour. A raid by Bedouins of the Beni Hajir A1 M or rah, Naeem and Monaseer 'tribes residing in El Katr has recently occurred against Omanees ; but the results are not serious. Bahrein. During the period under review Bahrein has enjoyed peace and prosperity. The improved aspect of affairs in Bahrein and its vicinity has allowed us to dispense with the constant presence of vessels ot war in those waters, but cruisers pay occasional visits as frequently as convenient. From time to time an Assistant Resident has been deputed to visit the islands in the Residency steamer, and 1 paid an official visit to the Chief during my tour in November. The Chief brought to notice a correspondence with the Governor of Busrah, the latter having brought forward certain demands on behalt of inhabitants of El Katr (Guttur) against subjects of Bahrein, itie Chief was recommended to reply in a fair and conciliatory tone. No complaints have been received from British Indian subjects residing in Bahrein, and the position of affairs seems on the whole more satisfactory than it has been in previous years. Nejd and El Katr (Guttur). The general political situation as regards the relations of the Tur kish Government with the family of the Native Chieftains is little changed. A Turkish garrison occupies Lahsa where resides a Governor on the part of Turkey, Mazeyyid, the son of Nasir Pasha, the VV ullee ot Busrah. Since the death of Saood ibn Feysul, the elder brother, Abdullah, has succeeded in obtaining his recognition by the other members ot tie family as its head and representative. r ihe Arab tubes o ie m eno excepting the A1 Ejman appears to concur.

The districts and Governments of the Persian Littoral from Mohara- merah to Jask are as follows : — (a.)—From Mohammerah to near Bunder Delam forms portion of the Province of Arabistan.

The Governor during the past year has been Ahmed Shah, but it is reported that Hajee Ahmed Khan is to be re instated. During the year the Government of Bushire has twice changed hands. Prince Assad-oollah Mirza having resigned in consequence of the recall of His Royal Highness the Hissam-es-Sultaneh from Shiraz. Abdul Hussein Khan Sirteep was appointed, but failed in the administration and was removed. The present Governor, the ' Saad-ul- Mulk,' was then appointed ; and has since been engaged collecting revenues in the districts with the assistance of a force of infantry and artillery. Some trouble and confusion occurred in Bushire from the prolonged absence of competent authorities, but on the whole affairs connected with British interests have received satisfactory treatment. Along the whole coast no cases have occurred demanding special notice, and m all cases when it has been necessary to complain of irregu lar proceedings on the part of the petty Sheikhs, the promptest and nTost coidial attention and assistance has been accorded by His Excellencv the Firman-1 irma, the present Governor-General of Fars.

In tlie montli of April last year I proceeded, with the permission of Government, on an official tour to Shiraz, accompanied by Lieutenant Eraser, Assistant Resident, and Surgeon Waters, Residency Surgeon. The most courteous reception was accorded to us by His Royal Highness the Hissam-es-Sultaneh, and we were treated with great consideration and hospitality during our short stay in Shiraz. I have already submitted to Government an account of the route we took returning by Ferozabad, which is less known than the Kazeroon road. I have since with the assistance of our Agent at Shiraz, Mirza Hassan Ali Khan, procured some statistical information concerning the sub-governments, divisions, and revenues of the Province of Fars. This information is embodied in a memorandum which I have thought might fitly be incorporated with the present Annual Report, and which will accordingly accompany it. To the lists of Governments and dis tricts I have appended complete lists of the villages in those tracts in immediate proximity to the sea, with which this Residency is most con cerned. A sketch map has also been compiled, which, though extremely imperfect, may serve to some extent to illustrate the Report. His Royal Highness the Hissam-es-Sultaneh having been recalled from Shiraz has been succeeded by the Motemid-ul-Mulk, Yahya Khan, who is styled Firman-Firma of Fars. The caravan routes are at present pretty clear of robbers. I have received very efficient and zealous assistance from the British Agent at Shiraz, Mirza Hassan Ali Khan, E stablishments.

As here understood, and as the name is now commonly applied, Fars includes all the districts of Southern Persia Proper, Lar being considered one of its subordinate Governments. Thus to Pars pertains the whole sea-board from 50° E. longitude to 58° E. longitude, that is, from Bunder Dilam to beyond Cape Jask. Its northern limit is between the 31st and 32nd parallels of north latitude, where the village of Aminabad marks the boundary between the Pars and Ispahan Provinces. To the west Pars is bounded by Khuzistan and Luristan, the village of Kala'i-A'ala being taken as the western limit of Behbehan. On the north-east the district of Aberkoh lies between Pars and Yezd, belonging to neither at present, and from the north-eastern corner to a point at no great distance north of Bunder Abbass the Pars frontier marches with that of Kirman. At one point on this line the eastern boundary of Pars is found at the village of Rud Khor in the district of Neyriz. The districts of Bunder Abbass lie in the strip between the sea and Ivirman and Bashkaid, and are included in Pars in a political rather than, geographical sense. The superficial area of the tract of Persia thus indicated must, without allowance for the mountainous nature of the 60,000 square miles. country, exceed j• • ^ are ^customed to regard this part of Persia as divided mto the Garmsn- or hot districts, and the ' Sardsir' or cool distncts, and these terms may be considered equivalent to 'lowlands' « e i J; la nds.

It would however be incorrect to say that Fars is divided into such Governments, as many large and important districts are not included in any of the divisions to which the term ' Principal Government' is applied. Many such districts, whilst not being looked on as in themselves separate ' Governments/' are managed through the headman directly by the Shiraz authorities. The following are what are considered chief Governments :— I. Behbehan ; II. Bushire; III. Lar and Saba; IV. Bunder Abbass; V. Darab; VI. Abadeh and Iklid, all of which have again subordinate districts. /.—Behbehan. The Government of Behbehan * is at present administered by the ' Ihtisham-ed-Dowleh/' Sultan Aweyss * Also called Kohgiluyeh. Mirza, son of Ferhad Mirza, Motemid-el- Dowleh, uncle of the Shah. The revenues of this Government are realized partly through the Zabits or Collectors o£ the vanous dis- tricts, and partly from the Chiefs of the Eeliat tribes. The principal districts of Behbehan are said to be : Huma, Jadawal, Zeydun, Lehrawi, Bunder-Dilam, Kohmarah, and the several villages inhabited by Arabs. The following are Lari tribes of Behbehan : Bahmai Teybi Niu Charam Buvair Ahmed of Sarhadd. Buvair Ahmed of Garmsir. Chief Ja'afer Khan. „ Hassan 'Ali Khan. ,, 'Abbass Khan. „ Khan Mohammed Khan. „ Mohammed Hassan Khan. Hussein Khan. This district of Behbehan is little known to us, and the routes to Shiraz and Kazerun require further surveying. There are several good streams, notably the Tab and Jerahi. At present there are said to be about 400 infantry, 26 artillery men, and two guns in Behbehan. //.— Government of Bushire and Districts. II. At some periods Bushire and the attached districts have been administered by a Governor holding office directly under ^ C^ 1 * 1 Government at Teheran and independent of the o\einor o ' present, however, the Governor is subordinate to ^Jd ' ' ment. The present Governor is Hossein Kuli Khan entitled Saad-1. 2. 3. 4. The (1) 8 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY Mulk ' The authority of this Governor extends over a tract reaching on the sea side from about thirty miles north of the town of Bushire to the port of Deyyer to the south. The Government of Bushire is divided into districts as follows Bushire with Heyat Daood and Ang-alee. Dashtistan. Tengistan. Dashtee. .x. Bushire district extends along the coast from Bunder Reg to Halilah Bay, and comprises under the town of Bushire the coastal sub-district of Hevat Daood and another to the north of town called Angalee, for each of which there are headmen under the immediate superintendence of the Governor. The district (2) of Dashtistan consists of that portion of the low- Ivino- plain between the sea and the mountains extending from the village of Dalikee to about Chakoota. The principal town of this district is Borazian, and the headman or Zabit of the whole district is Mohammed Hassan Khan. The villages of Dashtistan amount to about twenty- four. Next to Dashtistan to the southward is the district of (3) Tengis- tan, in which are upwards of thirty villages, the Chief of which is Ahram. This district opens on the sea. The present Zabits' are Ali Khan and Haidar Khan. The inhabitants are a race renowned for bravery and speaking a dialect peculiar to themselves. (4.) Dashtee is a more extensive and populous district than either of the two just mentioned. It has some 85 villages, the principal towns being Khormuj, and the present Chief, Haidar Khan. Dashtee lies south of Tengistan, and is bounded on the west by the sea, to the south by the Kongoon and Jam District, whilst to the eastward it extends to Booshkan in one of the valleys above the first range of mountains. The Bushire districts are dependent almost entirely on the rainfall for the growth of crops. The rivers of Khisht and Dalikee skirting the district of Dashtistan, unite and flow into the Rohillah creek some miles north of the town of Bushire. The lower part of Dashtee is traversed by a river which flows into the creek called Khor Ziaret. It is supposed that this is the river called further up the Karagach (the ancient Silakus), which is supposed to rise near Shahpoor and flow round to the eastward of Ferozabad. The Khor Ziaret can be entered by vessels of not exceeding six feet draught, and is navigable for such craft for some miles. I recently proceeded up the creek for about twelve miles, and the information eli cited fiom the inhabitants of the district tended to confirm the con jecture that here is the embouchure of the Karagach river. It would be an interesting and useful undertaking to march up this river as far as possible. districts. name, Whereas the y should ha ve been mentioned as distinctIra AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAH 1875-76. 9 III.— Government of Lar and Saba. The present Governor of Lar and Saba (for so this Government is styled) is Mohammed Hassan Khan. The districts are given as follows:— (1.) Forg. (2.) Tarum under deputies from the Governor. (3.) Duragha, (4.) Feen (5.) Fareghan (6.) Firmand (7.) Ahmedi (8.) Kuhistan (9.) Gohra (10.) Lar and Jerash (11.) Bustak, (12.) Shih-koh Zabit, Khairullah. Haj ee Ali. Ilais, Gharib Shah. Same. Hashim Khan. Ghulam Hussein Khan, llais Nusseer Khan. Agha Fath Ali. Mustafa Khan, Sheikh Mazkur. It will be observed that certain sea-coast towns and districts do not appear in the list of districts or sub-divisions though within the geo graphical limits of Lar. The Chief of Con gun, Gabendee, and the Islands of Sheikh Shoeyb and Hinderabee, for example, is directly under the Shiraz authorities. The port of Lingah and its district is likewise directly under Shiraz. The other seaports of Lar are under the Lar garrison, some being sub- districts of Bustak. The Lar districts are little known to Europeans, and the geo graphical position of the town of Lar but vaguely known. IV.— Government of Bunder Abbass. The Government of Bunder Abbass is divided into districts as follows:— . , n \ (1.) Bunder Abbass (about six villages). (2.) Shenul (about ten villages). (3.) Minab or Minao (about 30 villages). (4.) Biaban (16 villages). The present Governor is Ahmed Shah. An interesting ac count of some of these districts was furnished to Government in 1873 by Assistant Surgeon Abdur Raheem Hakeem, and printed by oidei ot Government. Y.— Government of Darab. The Government of Darab and districts was entrusted last year to Mohammed Taki Khan Sirteep. The districts are— 1. Mazeyjan and Hajiabad. 2. Rudah Khalesa. 3. City of Darab. 4. Sirkoh. 5. Karujat-el-Khair. Under a Deputy Governor. Five deputies. A Kalantar. Three Kedkhodas. One Kedkhoda.10 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY There are interesting ruins in those districts which are watered by several fine streams. Iron mines also exist in this part of Persia. J r I,— Government of Iklid and Ahadeh. The districts under Mirza Reza Khan, the present Governor, are— (1.) Town of Abadeh. (2.) Khush-kak. (3.) Sog-had. (4.) Iklid. (5.) Surmak. There are however numerous districts or Collectorates of Fars not included under any of the foreg-oing- chief divisions. The usual term for a cluster of villag-es constituting a district petty Government or Collectorate is ' Boolook.' The ' Boolooks' of Hooma, Korhal, Khafrek, and Mervdasht, &amp;c., are grouped in Shiraz districts, being directly administered by the Beglerbegee or Governor of Shiraz.

The Eeliat population lias greatly diminished of late years; as during 1 the last famine many perished with a large proportion of their cattle^and flocks ; others have of late abandoned the nomadic life and become members of the settled population, and this has been particularly the case with the once notable ' Feelee' tribe. Of all the Eeliats of Fars the Kashkaee are most numerous, and although the number has greatly diminished since the famine, they muster about 8,000 houses. This tribe have been great breeders of horses, but at present comparatively few are reared amongst them. The familes (Teerah) of Kashkaee are Ader Bav, Chardeh, Chireek, Lashnee. The Arab Eels have about 3,000 houses (or rather tents), and roam from their 'kishlaks' in Saba to the summer pastures, or ' yelaks' in Bowanat. They claim descent from the Benu Shaiban tube of Arabia. The Baseree tribe numbering about 1,000 houses are found in Mervdasht, Sirhadd -i-Chahar-dongah, and Servistan. The Baharloo tribe of about 1,000 tents inhabit Darab; others are the ' Anyaloo,' the ' Nafar' and AbuTwardee,' the ' Tewalelee' and ' Amlah Shaheethe 'Mamasennee' of about 1,000 houses inhabit Shoolistan. The following tribes are nearly extinct as nomads having mostly settled in towns :— ' Fcelee,' ' Bujat,' ' Berkushadee.' The Eeliats are for the most part governed immediately by Chiefs of their own who are appointed by the Government of Persia and held responsible for collection of revenue and the conduct of the tubes. The Kashkaee tribe have at their head on Eel Khanee and Eel Begee. The former is the higher title, and the nominal Eel Khanee now is Sultan Mahommed Khan, but as matters are, this personage's office is practically in abeyance, and is administered by a Persian Officer, Nowzer Mouza. The present Eel Begee is Darab Khan, brother of Sohrab Khan, who was put to death by the Persian Government at Shiraz. The resi dence of the Eel Khanee of the Kashkaee has till lately been at Ferozabad, where the late Eel Khanee Mahomed Koolee Khan commenced to build a pretty villa somewhat in European style. The chief caravan road traversing Pars is that which leads from Bushire to Shiraz by Kazeroon, and from Shiraz northwards towards Ispahan. Ihis road is well known to Europeans, has been frequently described, and has been accuiately surveyed by Major St. John, who has pie- pared a route map of the whole road between Bushire and leheran. Another route from Bushire to Shiraz passes through Ferozabad. This road is somewhat longer, but from the gradients being giea ei 3 i is Routes, &amp;o. There is also another road by which Ispahan can he made from Shiraz, known as the Sirhadd route.14 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY considered more capable of being made practicable for wheeled conveyances or artillery. At present this road is not used as regards the seaport traffic. From Bunder Deelam Shiraz can be reached through Behbeban. From Kongoon there is a road little traversed to Ferozabad. From Moglioo ; Lingah, the interior, can be gained through Lar, and from Bunder Abbass there is a tolerably good road to Lar, and a road by Feen- Forg, &amp;c., to Darab, whence many roads branch, as to Kirman, Shiraz, Yezd, Ferozabad, &amp;c. From Shiraz the principal routes to east, north and north-west are to Kirman, Ispahan, Yezd, the Sirhadd, and Behbehan. Some of these have been surveyed by British Officers, as that to Kirman by Niriz to Yezd. The road to Behbehan from Shiraz and that from Shiraz to Darab, and thence to Jehroom and Ferozabad and Kazeroon have been described by British Officers. But further south in Lar the country is almost unknown to us. The roads to the summer haunts of the Eeliats in the north-west of Fars, where the great mountain Koh-i-Dana or Koh-i- Padana rises to a height (according to St. John) of about 17,000 or 18,000 feet have, it is thought, never been explored by British travellers, though these districts are interesting enough to repay the toil of a jour ney through them.

A t the commencement of the official year 1875-76 the political Political. situation of Oman was not favorable for peace and prosperity, and the prospects of His Highness Syud Toorkee being' able to consolidate his position were perhaps less promising than at any former period of his rule. The country was in an unsettled state throughout, and the districts or valley of Semail was in particular very disturbed, the rival Hinawi and Ghaffiree clans inhabiting it being almost in open hostility. All the Ghaffirees in the Province of Oman were preparing to engage in the contest, and the Hinawis of El Sharkiyeh were also quite ready to come to the assistance of their partizans at Semail, and were only held in check by the Beni Bu Ali and other Ghaffirees in Jaalan. In the north-vyest the hostilities and animosities that had been goino- on for some time previous in El Shemal had by this time spread over'El Jow and a great part of El Dhahireh and the Naim tribe at El Berevmi were expecting to be attacked by a large force of the Beni Yas. The general complication and danger to peace was moreover being increased by the intrigues and sedition of the Metowasin El Sharkiyeh, who were endeavouring to foment disaffection and cause a rising against His Highness authority. Repeated endeavours had been made by the well-disposed to effect an amicable adjustment of the Semail difficulty through the mediation, nnp n ~ e \ 0 T f ^ e ^ 0vva Mahomed El Gharibee, and subse- quently by the Bu Hassan and El Hejrieen Sheikhs.

Towards the end of June a disagreement occurred between His Highness Syud 1 oorkee and his brother, Abdool Azeez, regarding the Customs farm and the conduct of His Highness' favourite dependent, a man named Mesh, which after some discussion resulted in the temporary dismissal of the latter from Muscat. In July a body of about five hundred of the Al Wahibeh under Sheikh Hamood bin Said arrived at Muttrah, and having been admitted as friends into Muscat, took advantage of His Highness' position and the state of affairs to extort money and to impose hard conditions to which His Highness was compelled to yield. Partly in consequence of this affair His Highness Syud Toorkee and Abdool Azeez again became estranged and distrustful of each other. On the 10th August a fresh disagreement took place between His Highness Syud Toorkee and Syud Abdool Azeez regarding the guards in 'the two' forts at Muscat, and the estrangement eventually became so complete that His Highness determined on taking over the entire control of affairs himself and dispensing with the assistance ot his bro ther altogether. His Highness, however, very soon found himself unable to carry on the government alone, and made a final resolve to retire trom power in favour of his brother. On the 15th August His Highness Svud Toorkee, after a fresh demonstration of the Bedouins against his authority, betook himself on board the Rehmani corvette and appointed Syud Abdool Azeez to act as regent during His Highness absence, it being his intention to retire to Gwadur. Syud Abdool Azeez ace . - ingly assumed charge of the government, and His Highness Sy Toorkee having embarked on board Her Majesty s Rifleman left M^t on the 21st August for Gwadur.

In the same month an event occurred in El Sharkiyeh, in which three of the Bu Hassan were slain by a party of the A1 Wahibeh thereby establishing a blood-feud between these tribes which still remains open. On the 11th December His Highness Syud Abdool Azeez left Muscat to proceed to Semail with the object, it is believed, of replacing the Ghaffiree garrison of that fort with a Hinawi one, and His Highness was still absent from Muscat when His Highness Svud Toorkee unexpectedly arrived at Muttrah on the night of the 13th in a native boat and succeeded in occupying that town and the forts commandino- it without opposition. At this juncture Muscat was in charge of the Governor, Syud Mahomed Azan, and a small garrison of about sixty Bu Hassan, who on hearing of His Highness Syud Toorkee's arrival resolved to hold out and defend the place until orders had been received from His Highness Syud Abdool Azeez. They were repeatedly called on to submit but declined, and negotiations with them carried on by His Highness Syud Toorkee proved fruitless. In the meantime His Highness Syud Abdool Azeez wrote to the Governor of Muscat, requesting that the defence be continued, as he was collecting men and coming to their aid. His Highness had been growing increasingly unpopular for some time, and he seems to have miscalculated his power, as he was not able to gather sufficient force to leave Semail. His chief supporter, Saleh bin Ali, was not expeditious in joining him, and when at engtii Saleh moved out of Sharkiyeh, it was too late to avail any lin g- On the 19th His Highness Syud Toorkee, who had been joined by a force of Ghaffirees from Nakhl, occupied the suburbs of Muscat, an mng continued for two days between his men and the town without any oss to either side.

In the same month His Highness Syud Toorkee despatched Syud Bedr bin Seif on a mission to Seined, and negotiations were carried on for some time with His Highness Syud Abdool Azeez through Sheikh Saleh no result, however, was arrived at, and Syud Bedr returned to Muscat. Subsequently His Highness Syud Abdool Azeez wrote to the Political Agent, requesting an interview with a view to some arrangement being effected between himself and His Highness Syud Toorkee through the mediation of Government. His Highness Syud Toorkee's position at the present time is encour aging, and with the able assistance of his Minister Syud Said will, it is hoped', continue to improve, though His Highness cannot be said to have a very secure tenure of power.
