Junkers from Herat to Dakka via Kandahar and Kabul. This question has been under consideration in consultation with the Government of India. The views of c * H.M.G. on the subject are indicated in j the correspondence of which a copy is &lt; } enclosed, and those of the G. of I. are stated in their express letters of 15 January and 1 February, 1932, copies! of which were sent to you direct. From the British point of view there would appear to be some advantage in t ( the operation of internal air services in Afghanistan by Junkers, as such an arrangement would be likely to afford an effective counter to proposals by thi Soviet for extending their own air services in that country. H.M.G. would prefer, however, that if possible Junkers should not operate between Kabul or Kandahar and the Indian frontier. 3./ 415a ;',000 10/31 '3.

In these circumstances it seems probable that if the position is explained to Messrs. Junkers in suitable language, that company, which is a commercial undertaking, would ir. all likelihood abandon the idea of a Kabul-Dakka extension as being commercially unprofitable, and that they would in their own interests make Kabul the terminus of any service in Afghanistan for which they may succeed in obtaining a contract from the Afghan Government. At the same time, as your statement to Herr Schworbel/ /Draft Paper Department Schworbel would not contain an/ expression of an objection on the part of to a Kabul-Dakka link as such, we should thus avoid or at any rate reduce the risk apprehended » by the n -. of I. that the Afghan Govt., if they hear of the conversationi night find cause for talcing offence ^ on the score of outside interference.(J&gt; 1771.

We still regard as politically objectionable operation of any foreign air line in south eastern Afghanistan, whether from Kabul to Dakka or Kandahar to Chaman, and if it were matter of free choice by ourselves should naturally prefer Junkers’ Service to terminate at Kabul or Kandahar. This however is case in which choice lies not with us but with Afghans who, as Minister has told us, are hyper-sensitive to all semblance of outside inter ference and amongst alternatives presented we have to be content v/itfr that which seems to us lease evil.

Please see the letters to the Mr Ministry and the Government of India at P.Z. 7453/31 and c£r the Mr Ministry’s reply of 5th January and the G. of I’s reply of 15th January which has now been received. The G. of I. do not adhere to their previous attitude expressed in their letter of 16th February, 1931, that the operation of an air service by foreigners in Afghanistan near the Indian Frontier would be objectionable on political grounds. In fact they'go so far as to suggest that our reply to the present German enquiry might be that if Messrs. Junkers regard an air service to Dacca as likely to be profitable H.M.G. are prepared to view the enterprise with benevolence. We need not go so far as this with reference to the Kabul- Dacca extension. But as previously suggested and agreed with the Air Ministry, we can welcome the possibility of a service Herat-Kandahar-Kabul, and as regards the question of a section Kabul to Dacca we can point out that there can be no question of an extension of Junkers service into India, and that there is no present prospect of a connection with an Indian service at the Indian Frontier; it is probable that in these circumstances Messrs.Junkeis would abandon the idea of an extension from Kabul to Dacca as being commercially unprofitable.

This question has been under consideration in consulta tion with the Government of ■x ~ f \ India, .and the views of H.M.G. dh the subject are indicated in the correspondence of which/copy is enclosed^ From the British point of view there would appear to be some advantage in the operation of internal air services in Afghanistan by Junkers, as such an arrangement would be like ly to afford an effective counter to proposals by the Soviet for extending their own air services in that country. H.M.G* would prefer, however, that if possible Junkers should not operate between Kabul or Kandahar and the Indian frontier. 3.

The Air Council for their part see no objection to Junkers being permitted to operate as far as Kabul, but consider that on general strategic grounds it is undesirable to depart from the policy of excluding all foreign air lines on the Kabul-Dakka and Kandahar-Chaman routes. They feel that if at the outset it is made clearto Junkers that there is no prospect of their being allowed to extend their services into India, that Company, which is a commercial undertaking unconcerned with the strategic aspects of air route developments, would in all prohahility abandon the idea of the Kabul-Dakka extension as commercially unprofitable• Subject to the foregoing remarks the Aif Council concur in the course of action suggested in paragraph 5 of the India Office letter and in the observations contained in paragraph 6 .

These no rotiations, he said, had been entiTusted to himself, and he had conduct©* thm) very skilfully* He had begun by insisting on separate treatment of the two distinct questions involved; the first being that of a through mail service, and the second that of a Russo-Afghan line between femes; snd Kabul * 3* as regards the first, he had told ? , :: , tark that if the International Bureau approved the scheme, and the Afghan Government were satisfied as to its financial prospects, the Afghan Government would make their own arrangements for the transport of mails by air from Patta ''eaar, on the Russian frontier, to micka, on the Indian. In reply to M*Stark's enquiry as to the nature of these arrangenents, fM9'MMlMMft had replied that this was a question for settlement between the Afghan Government and the International Bureau.

Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Kabul, to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, London, No. 104, dated the 6th August 1931. At an interview which I had with the Foreign Minister on July 30, I informed His Excellency that I was now in a position to reply to his enquiry regarding the attitude of His Majesty’s Government in the event of war between Russia and Afghanistan ; although, in view of the subsequent conclusion of the Russo-Afghan Neutrality Pact, the question had possibly lost some of its importance. 2. Faiz Muhammad took this suggestion quite seriously, and hastened to assure me that it was entirely incorrect. The Afghan Government, he said, attached no significance whatever to any treaties which they might sign with the Soviet, since for the latter treaties existed only on paper (‘ Sir-i-Kaghaz ’). He had heard this from Lenin himself, and Trotsky’s writings admitted as much. The Afghan Government’s diplomatic relations with the Soviet in the past had led them to the same conclusion, and their policy was now to satisfy the demands of the Soviet in every possible direction, whether these were for the conclusion of * paper agreements’, or for the negotiation of a Commercial Treaty, but, at the same time, to resist any demands which might involve an infringement of the principle of reciprocity or the sacrifice of their own essential interests, or a breach of their obligations to other Powers. Their attitude was one, as the King had said in his speech on July 6, of impartiality towards their neighbours. The Soviet professed to approve this attitude, but in reality were anxious to secure special facilities, such as for the furtherance of propaganda on the Indian frontier, for themselves. In regard to the Commercial Treaty the Afghan Government were determined to insist on strict reciprocity; if Afghan merchants were debarred, as at present, from private trade in Russian territory, and allowed to deal only with official organisations, the Afghan Government would similarly open official bureaux in their frontier towns, and prohibit all commercial dealings with Russia except through such ‘ bureaux ’. They had made careful enquiries from the Turkish and Persian Ambassadors regarding the operation of the commercial agreements which their Governments had concluded with Russia. Both Ambassadors had described the results of such agreements in the same terms ; much friction, complete disregard by the Soviet of their obligations, and little profit, if any, to the other contracting party. The experience of His Majesty’s Government, Faiz Muhammad said, was understood to have been similar. Their recognition of the U. S. S. R. did not seem to have resulted in any great expansion of British e^yi^rts to Russia, and the Arcos raid was an object lesson which Afghanistan had taken to heart. His Government had no intention of signing away any tangible advantages, or of gratifying any Foreign Power to the detriment either of their own independence or of their obligations to other Powers. But if the Soviet asked them to make vague professions of good faith they were reaciy to do so to any extent, since these were both harmless and, when one was dealing with the Soviet, meaningless. Sooner or later however the Soviet would realise that, in spite of the apparently cordial attitude of the Afghan Government, they were getting no neaier to the ir real objectives. They would then present demands of a kind which the Afghan Government would be compelled to resist; and it was then that the pinch would come. 3 Faiz Muhammad was evidently glad of the opportunity to offer an explana tion for the satisfaction of His Majesty’s Government, of the ‘ ostentatious rap prochement with the Soviet ’, noticed in paragraph 6 of my despatch No. 98, dated July 24. A lt.lio no-h this explanation h ad obviously been carefully prepared I have no reason, at pres| mt, to rg^^j^ ij^smcereTj IftfllA FOREIGN SECRETARY'S \ Letter i [118 ' 20 L] ffe; : iJfch4. As soon as it was finished, I replied to his enquiry in the terms of the third paragraph of your telegram No. 80, dated July 24. In view of the importance of this statement, I used written notes of a Persian translation, which I had prepared beforehand. Faiz Muhammad’s attitude during this statement was one of earnest attention, and when it was concluded he repeated some of the more significant expressions such as ‘ maintenance of a strong and independent friendly Afghanistan ’ ‘ depend upon circumstances of the moment’, etc., and asked me to confirm his recollection of them. He had understood me quite correctly, but whether he will quote this conver sation with equal correctness in future seems open to doubt. He then asked me to explain and develop/ the reference which I had made to the Covenant of the League of Nations. I ran through Articles 11 to 17 with him making it quite clear that my doing so was not to be regarded in any way as imply ing that His Majesty’s Government would necessarily take such action in the con tingency in question. His Excellency remarked that he would have to study the Covenant again more closely, but it seemed to him that Afghanistan had much to gain by joining the League. After some airy speculations of the kind which always beguile him, Faiz Muhammad closed the discussion by saying that the reply of His Majesty’s Govern ment, even if it was not all that his Government could desire, was, he thought, all that they could reasonably expect. They would not press for any agreement with His Majesty s Government in this connection, but hoped that an occasional exchange o Views ( tabadila-i-afkar ”) might be found possible.

Sir, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to refer to the despatch from H.h. Minister at Kabul, Ro. 151 of 6th November 1931, relative to an enquiry addressed to him by the German Minister regarding the probable attitude of H.M.G. towards an air service operated by Junkers 1 on the route Her at-Kandahar-Kabul- 4^' fa. ■ {fa, S*J ^ X &gt; 2 - Dakka. 2. On the assumption that it is the definite policy of the | Afghan Government to develop air communications in their country, Sir Samuel Hoare, as at present advised and subject to what is ' • said below, considers that for the following reasons there would x be an advantage from the British point of view in an agreement between the Afghan Government and Junkers for the operation of internal air services in Aighan- istan. Such an agreement would v limit the possible sphere of operation of Russian aeroplanes, and in particular a Junkers’ service between Herat and Kandahar would be the most effective 214a 4000 8.81effective means of preventing a revival of a project for a Russian service on- the line Kushk-Kandanai . Nor does he see any great objection to Junkers operating as far as Kaoui (which the Afghan Government would presumably regard as an essential part of the scheme). 3. On the other hand, as j regards the Kabui-Dakka extension, the Government of India in their letter of 16th February 1931 (copy of which was sent to the Air Ministry i with the letter from this department j of 3rd March 1931, No. P.Z.1184) indicated that they saw political objections to the operation of any foreign (non-Afghan) service near the • Indian frontier. The Government of t India are being asked for their present views on this political aspect of the question. If they adhere to their objections, it might be desirable to endeavour to secure that Kabul should be made the terminus of the proposed Junkers service from the commencement. It is ciesar, however, that, both on political and on strategic grounds, our main desideratum is to limit, and if possible prevent, the penetration of Russian air services in Afghanistan, and that it is undesirable to check any development tendingDraft Paper. Department. 214a 4000 8.31 tending to secure this object. It, therefore, the Afghan Government or Junkers should regard the Kabul- Dakka link as an essential part of the scheme, the political objections thereto might have to be reconsidered. 4. There is the further consideration that if the Afghan- Soviet negotiations, which at present appear to be making slow progress, should ultimately result in a renewal of the agreement of November 1927 regarding the Taslikent-Kabul service, the Government of India may still wish to take up their option on a service between India and Kabul. In such an event ; even if Junkers had previously established a service as far as Dakka, we should have to use every endeavour to secure its future restriction to a terminus at Kabul and the establishment of a British service between Kabul and India. 5. Sir Samuel Hoare would propose, subject to the viev/s of the Air Council and of the Government of India, to sugg es t' to the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsAffairsthat Sir H. Maconachie might be instructed that he may let herr Schworbel know orally that, so far as| H.M. G-overnment are concerned, Messrs. Junkers could count on our good will if they succeed in obtaining a contract from the Afghan Grovernment for the operation of a service between Herat, Kandahar and Kabul; at the same time, however, it should * be made clear that, even if a connexion were established with India, there can be no question of Indian or British mails being carriedi between India and Europe by such a service (which might presumably link | up on the West either with Imperial Airways’ service at BagIxiad or with the Russian service via Baku), nor, of course, of Junkers extending their service into India itself. 6. As regards the reply to be given on the subject of a Kabui- Dakka link, there appear to be two possible alternatives, the choice between which will largely depend on the Government of India’s views on the political aspect of the question. (1) Herr Schworbel might be informed that H.I.Gr, would prefer that Kabul should fram the commencement be made the terminus of the proposed Junkers service. (2) in reply to HerrSchworbe suggestion as to British co-operationDraft Paper Department. at DakKa Sir R. Llaconachie might explain that there is no immediate prospect of a connection with an Indian air service at the Afghan frontier, but that it is possible that at some future time the Government of India may wish to propose to the Afghan Government the establishment of a service between India and Kabul, and that in that event a connection could be established with Junkers service at the latter place, if the Afghan Government and Junkers should agree.Draft Paper.

The financial difficulties involved in these negotiations were referred to in ay telegram f Tfo.33 of February 14, and a recent statement of my German colleague that the Afghan Government had offered Junkers a yearly subvention of £4,000 - a sum which he character!sad. as utterly inadequate - throws some light on this particular point* 3. Yesterday Herr Schworbel asked me what the probable attitude of His Majesty*s Government would be towards an air service operated by Junkers from Herat to Ba’Gca, via Kandahar and Kabul, as an extension of their Tehran • deshed line* He himself considered that British cooperation was essential to the success of such a scheme, and passengers landing at Bakka, would, if thei*e were no connecting air service at that place, li&amp;ve to proceed onwards by rail from Lan&amp;i liana• 4. I expressed my inability to reply offhand to this enquiry, but suggested that the reopening of the Tehran * Meshed line seemed to be a condition precedent to its extension, and asked what the onourable uuess of Heading, GOB., GCSI., ©to etc etca. prospects in this direction were* 5 . Herr sehworbel said that the Tehran - Keshed line had been closed because it did not pay, but that its financial prospects would be entirely altered if, instead of being a mere branch line, it became a link in a through service to India. He was personally very hopeful that the scheme for the Herat ~ pakka service would prove practicable. He was discussing it with the Prime Minister, who was as entirely in favour of it as he was opposed to the proposal for a Russian service. The less the Soviet -Subassy heard of these discussions the better «• for obvious reasonsj but he had considered it proper to inform me of them in confidence, partly because the good-will and cooperation of my Government were essential to the success of the project, and partly because he did not wish me to learn of them first from any other quarter, and so suspect that he had been trying to keep me in the dark. 6 . Herr Schworbel spoke of the carriage of passengers to Gakka, but did not mention mails. 7.

Sir, I have read with great interest your despatch -o- - L ^i&gt; 10th September last, reporting the conversations which you had in September with Ifing Nadir and the Afghan ministers regarding the present relations of the Afghan Government with the Soviet. I fully realise the difficulties in which you were placed during these conversations by the enquiries and applications made by the Afghan Government on subjects in regard to which His Majesty’s Government are not in a position to give definite replies, and I approve entirely the language which you held to His Majesty and his ministers. 2. As regards the natural interest which was again evinced by the Afghan Prime Minister in the Afridi question, the position has now, I hope, been rendered easier by the settlement with the tribe which has been concluded. 3. The conversations on the question of Russian and British air services were particularly interesting, and I regard as especially satisfactory the assurance which King Nadir gave to you, in response to your statements on 17th September, that he would never agree to the operation of a Russian service eastwards of the Kabul-Kandahar line. 4. His Majesty’s Government note King Nadir’s suggestion that the British General Staff might be able to advise 'in general terms' with reference to the defence of the northern frontier of Afghanistan. Subject to any observations which you and the Government of India may have to make, it Richard Maconachie, K.B.E.,C.I.E., seems/ tc., etc., etc., Kabul.seems necessary in this matter to adhere to the decision which was arrived at on the earlier suggestion of military conversations. The reasons for which it was decided that this suggestion should be discouraged were those indicated in the Government of India’s telegram of 22nd March last ho. 105, K., namely, the risk that such conversa tions would be interpreted by the Afghan Government as implying some military commitment, however clearly this might have been disclaimed beforehand. I shall be glad of your views on this aspect of the matter, and also on the possibility of your being able to continue in future successfully to parry suggestions for military conversations or advice. 5. A copy of this despatch is being sent 6y the Secretary of State for India to the Government of Indm.

The Air Ministry letter encloses an interest ing/ 4494 a. 5000 5/30ing table of comparison of the flying times of a Russian service to Chaman with ^Imperial Airways service to Karachi. Though the comparison (neglecting periods of stops for rest or lack of conn action, which are unknown so fax as the Russian service is conccrne and would probably be considerable) shows a balance in favour of the hypothetical Russian service.it would he necessary to add the times taken for transport in India and also the time taken in ;transfer from air to rail at the Frontier (including all the formalities necessary for crossing the Frontier); all this would amount to a considerable period in the case of mails carried by the Russian service;- e.g. the time by rail from Chaman to Delhi 48 hours. If therefore,we 4*) to use the argument that the Russian service would not be commercially profitable, we could make out a strong case for showing that there is little commercial advantage to be anticipated Afgjianistan or Russia from the service from Kushk to Kandahar and that the objects of the Soviet are therefore probably other than commercial. The estimate,for which Imperial Airways were unofficially asked,of their charges for a service between Karachi and Kandahar are likely to be con sidered prohibitive by the Government of India.

Ministry’s letter contains certain information bearing on a compaiti-iBon ^ in point of time of a Russian service via Kushk (either rail and air or all air) with the British Marine service It will be observed that though - as regards actual flying hours a Russian all-air service from Kushk as far as Chaman would compare favourably with Imperial Airways 7 i service to Karachi, the comparison | makes no allowance for stops for rest or lack of connection. Moreover it would appear that in considering what commercial advantage, if any, would be obtained by Russia and Afghanistan as a result of the conveyance of The note enclosed with the Air &gt;) ./•// • or Imperial Airways service. / •Ia 4000 8/31 international/international mails to India, it is necessary to add to the time which would he taken by theV^ 8 ? 01 ^ of the sails as far as the Indian frontier, the additional time which would be taken in transferring the mails across the^ontier to rail head and transferring them thence by rail to the&lt;\destinations in India; this time would presumably be longer than that occupied in the distribu- tion of mails by air or rail from Karachi. It appears from the recent telegrams and despatches from Kabul ending ith despatch No. 130 of 2 October that the risk that the Afghan Government may enter into an agree ment with the Soviet for an airt service from Kushk to Kandahar is n'dfr more remote,and that there is in any case little danger that they would grant a continuation of such Russian service eastward of Kandahar!

I am afraid that we have no information beyond what you have in the India Office with regard to estimating an air plus rail service, but we have examined the alternative routes for an air service to Delhi, and the following' information will be of interest and may be of some use to you. I enclose a copy of Imperial Airways* latest timetable to India. By this timetable it takes just over six days to reach Karachi, and just over seven days to reach Delhi, the distance by this route being 5,753 miles. It has never been pretended that the route followed by Imperial Airways is the most direct route. The route from London via Russia and Afghanistan is very nearly the great circle route, and therefore much shorter. According to calculations made by Major Mealing, the distances from London to Delhi by a route via Berlin - Moscow - Tashkent - Kabul - Lahore to Delhi is 4,615 miles and via Berlin - Moscow - Tashkent - Kushk - Kandahar to Delhi is 5,080 miles compared with the 5,753 miles by Imperial Airways route. Therefore on the basis of distance alone Imperial Airways’ route is the least satisfactory, but against this it is possible to operate the Persian Gulf route all the year round with considerable regularity. Owing to the extremely mountainous nature of the other routes it would theoretically appear to be quite impossible to operate them during the winter months, and at all times the timetable would ■ &lt;t al ton, j^sq., 0*3., M.C., INDIA OFFICE, S.W.i. be/II d9lavs amounting to days at a time owing *9 subject to ser ' ou ® fl^er hand we have had from two sources to had weather.

He said that unless at least one were sold to-day the whole offer for the three of them would be withdrawn. The offer has been made by the British Aviation Assurance Co.Ltd. which requires one immediately to replace one belonging to a policy-holder which has recently crashed. If the Government of India decides to keep any of the Avro Xs on the chance of their becoming eventually useful for a weekly service to Kabul, it seems almost certain that two would be ample for such weekly service (one to fly and one in reserve) and that even one would be sufficient at a pinch. I therefore told that he need not refuse the immediate sale of one machine, and that he should do his best to keep alive the offer for the other two.X ‘t * ■% RAFT TELEGRAM. SORETARY OF STATE TO P ?

I am commanded by the Air Council to refer to India Office letter of the 21st September, P.Z.5637/31, on the subject of negotiations between the Soviet and Afghan Governments regarding an . air service between ferinez and Kabul or between Kushk and Kandahar and in reply am to forward, for the information of the Secretary of State for India, a note summarising information available in this Department on the subject of the enquiries contained in the second paragraph of the letter from the Gov rnment of India dated the 17th August. It will be observed that the services referred to in paragraph 2 (a) (l) and (2) of the Government of Indian letter are likely in both cases to compare favourably in point of time with British marine and air services respectively. In accordance with the suggestion contained in the fifth paragraph of the India Office letter, the Air Council have approached Imperial Airways unofficially and have ascertained that the Company’s estimate for a service once weekly in each direction between Karachi and Kandahar would be £27,5uQ per annum while for a service twice weekly in each direction the cost would be £40,000. These estimates are based on the assumption that De Havilland Hercules 3-engiEd aircraft would be used and make no allowance for the cost of any publicity or for any revenue from the service. The Council have also given careful consideration to the suggestion of the Government of India that in the event of it nder Secretary of 3 ,tate t)R!!R r Political Department, _ _ India Office, s. v/.l. p.Q ( SECRET DEPT.

The Council are, however, prepared I if the necessity arises and there is no alternative means of keepiil alive the option promised by the Afghan Government^to approach thsj Treasury with a proposal that two Victoria aircraft and their creisj should be lent without charge to the Government of India for a period of six months on the understanding:~ (a) that the whole cost of maintenance including the pay and allowances of the personnel will be defrayed by the Government of India, and j (b) that should it become necessary during the period of the loan owing to unforeseen circumstances to provide for the replacement of the aircraft in any other Boyal Air j?oree command the arrangement will be terminated• Before talcing this step the Air Council desire however to suggest that the Government of India should consider the possibility of utilising for such service the four Avro 1 aircraft which were purchased for the proposed Indian State Air Service. suitable for the purpose as their performance is satisfactory and they are more economical to run than either the De ‘ Ha v ill and/ objection which might be raised by the Afghan Government to the use of military aircraft and obviate the financial difficulty which the Council foresee if it is proposed to utilise Royal Air Force aircraft from another command. ohould it become necessary to institute the service and maintain.

This al ternative route is more difficult to operate and longer than the one described above.

OF p -z G S ih *0 if Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Kabul, to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, London, No. 121, dated 19th (received 23rd) September 1931 (very Confidential). m — During the past few days, as I had the honour to report in my telegram No. 197 )f September 18, I have had some interesting conversations with King Nadir Shall md the Afghan Ministers regarding the present relations of the Afghan Govern- nent with the Soviet. The negotiations now in progress between these Governments for an air mail service through Afghanistan also came under discussion, but although information m this subject was given on each occasion in some detail, and with apparent frankness, it does not appear that any progress has in fact been made since my belegram 156 of August 23 was written, and it is consequently unnecessary to do more than summarise the additional items of intelligence which emerged from bhese lengthy conversations. 2. On September 8, the Prime Minister asked me if I knew anything about locusts, swarms of which had appeared in Kataghan. I said that I had little experience of them, but understood that there were a number of Russian experts on the subject some of whom had been employed in Persia. He remarked that the services of these had already been offered to his Government by the Soviet Em bassy, and that this offer was being considered by the Cabinet. Personally, however he preferred the locusts. On September 12, His Highness informed me somewhat excitedly that, he had now obtained definite proof of the Soviet’s complicity in the rising led by Ibrahim Beg, whom they had kept supplied with munitions so long as it suited them to do so. This showed clearly that they were ready to foment anarchy in Afghanistan whenever their interests demanded it. Things were quiet enough at the moment, but the Soviet were not satisfied with Afghan professions. Negotiations for the Air Agreement and Trade Convention were almost at a standstill; Russian in- fluence had been entirely eliminated from the Afghan army and air force, in both of which, towards the end of Amanullah’s reign, it had been predominant; and, although a certain amount of intrigue between the Soviet Embassy and the Indian frontier no doubt continued, the Afghan Government were achieving success in suppressing it. The mysterious people who used to visit that Embassy in disguise and after dark could no longer do so. The Soviet might therefore at any time decide to employ coercive measures to render the Afghan Government more Amenable to their wishes. They might, for instance, engineer some fresh disturb ance in the north, on which it was essential at the present juncture for the Afghan Government to concentrate their whole attention. This remark, not unexpectedly, led up to an appeal of the kind I have already reported, for a speedy settlement of the Afridi question, and the adoption by the Government of India of a conciliatory policy towards the tribes of their north western frontier. 3. On September 16 the Foreign Minister informed me that the air negotiations had not advanced, and remarked, in confirmation of the suggestion made in para graph 5(b) of my telegram 156 of August 23, that the Russian proposal for reciprocity in the working of this service was intentionally meaningless. Amanullah s agree ment had contained a similar provision and, in all the years that has since elapsed, not a single Afghan machine had ever flown to Tashkent. It was idle to talk of reciprocity between two parties one of whom had a large supply of aircraft and the other none at all. The conversation then turned to the subject of visas, and Faiz Muhammad explained that the unaccommodating attitude of his Government on this ques tion arose, not from suspicions of British or British Indian visitors as a class, but from the difficulties attaching to discrimination in their favour as compared with Russian applicants. In support of this statement His Excellency showed me an extremely stiff note which he had just received from M. Stark, in reply to a request by the Afghan Government for the release of an Afghan merchant imprisoned in 'ICLOSURfc »N REIGN S£r. r -'' V G2 A r , i r0pd t i ie Afghan Government with unfriendliness ii Turkestan.

I • Muhammad said that tne note would be alarm. In answer to my the Afghan Government were «„ ing if it came from any o ^ Soviet Embassy. The conversation ended familiar with the htcran . Muhammad, possibly owing to the coldness «t1 without any request ^ t “de afew days before', that a free supply „1 his Government just now. 4. King Nadir Shah hTsSIv 0 —ns'ed the whole course of negotiations, first with Junkets and His Ma l st &gt; s ' H t ld me how, just when an argreement with Junkets™ mTig' Herr B^ tz Kgg'ted thi air bridge scheme as likely to he at- rofitabl’e fm the Afghan Government than the terms of the monopoly oM, Junkers how the Soviet had then protested against any agreement with Junky and while offering to recondition the Afghan machines free of all charge, had Hi out dazzhne prospects of the profits to be made from the carnage by air o k European mads for India and the Further East His Majesty mentioned tta threat to take the air mails 'through Persia, and stated the present position* in much the same terms as his foreign Minister had used. , 5 In acknowledging His Majesty’s courtesy in giving me this information! I said that while, as he would readily understand, the formal institution o a ta air service anywhere in Afghanistan would be of great interest to His Majesty Government, any possibility of the operation of such a service eastwards of® Kabul-Kandahar line would cause them grave concern. If they were satisfied such a possibility existed, my Government would have to take measures to protec their own interests, although I could not as yet say precisely what ioim sue measures would take. King Kadir Shah replied that he would never agree to the operation of a Russian service in the area I had mentioned. He was fully alive to the angs involved—to Afghanistan as much as to India by any form of Russian penetra 1 ®. He would however be glad to hear from me whether, from the standpoint o | common interests of Afghanistan and India, a combination of a Russian service west and north of the line I had mentioned with a British service east of it wou be regarded as objectionable by His Majesty’s Government. I said that if l! Majesty really wanted a definite reply to this enquiry I should have to reierit instructions, but understood that matters had not yet reached the stage at it might arise for practical consideration. I explained that our agreement ol year, providing, in certain circumstances, for the offer of an Air Convention to ^ Majesty’s Government, had been only a precaution designed to safeguard hn^ interests in an eventuality which was possible but not yet actual. His Ma]® , replied that he remembered our agreement perfectly, and that his present en( l l I i 1 !’ did not require an answer at once, although he might have to repeat it later, whole matter was very much ‘ in the air ’ so far, and although he did not tm there would be any developments before my return from India, he 'would see Major Fraser-Tytier was kept informed if there were any* tlie note*! an Goverif Tie coDTt|- wing to let ntore, tiatafe ustnow, eptembein; ^reementi,. measiel|ti ){tlie Mf::' y agreement y freeofalcfe tie carriage li 5 Majesty mi :ed tie p» i dug metliisi oalinstitntioL ; interest to I i service Iftliey^' otakem®0 precisely i ree to tk s fully alive ;; nnofR®®; roni tkestH! itionofafc- .sh service ment. I® 1 should kve ; eachedtk* conjecture His Majesty was perfectly correct)—leading up to a request for assist ance in tlie form of artillery or rifles from His Majesty’s Government. He fully realised the financial stringency existing both in great Britain and in India, and was profoundly grateful for the timely and generous assistance already given him. What he wanted now was expert military advice as regards the defence of his northern frontier and Herat, and the improvement of communications between these areas and Kabul. As His Majesty’s proposal seemed to envisage the military conversations which I had been instructed in Mr. Henderson’s telegram No. 34 of April 4, to dis courage, I replied that I did not think British military experts would offer any advice on this subject until they had actually examined the terrain, while the existing situation, both in Afghanistan itself and vis-d-vis Russia, rendered such an examination impracticable. The King replied that he quite realised this was so, but he felt sure that the British General Staff had already considered a subject which was so important from their own point of view, and so might be able to give him advice in general terms. Examination of the ground could be made when circumstances permitted, and this was not yet. 6. Even this rough summary of my recent conversations with the King and his Ministers sufficiently illustrates the difficulty of the subject, and shows how inevitably a discussion of it invites embarrassing applications-—whether for machine guns, military conversations, modifications of the policy of His Majesty’s Govern ment on the Indian frontier, or a definite decision as to the institution of a British air service in Afghanistan—which I am obliged by my instructions to discourage. Since however some allowance has kindly been made for such difficulties in Your Lordship’s telegram No. 88 of September 11,1 need not dilate on them. 7. On September 16 my German colleague gave me a personal message from Herr Bonatz, assuring me that, so long as he was in Afghanistan he would take no action of any kind prejudicial to British interests. Herr Schworbel is of course, a strong supporter of the cause of Junkers, and has, he tells me, reported to his Government that Herr Bonatz’ attitude, in regard to air and other matters, is likely to prejudice his own relations with the British Legation, on whose good will German interests in Afghanistan are entirely dependent. If Herr Bonatz has heard of this report, or of the action reported in paragraph 4 of my telegram No. 156, dated August 23, his sudden change of attitude is not difficult to explain. The actual significance of his message remains to be proved but the fact of his sending it suggests that the attitude of His Majesty s Govern ment towards Russian air penetration is not regarded locally as likely to be one of acquiescence, within the meaning of Your Lordship s telegram No. 88 of Septem ber 11. 8.

'| ,o SEEN rtCAL COMMITTEE. 16 OCT ious Papers - 4475b 1000 5.30 FOR INFORMATION. The Secretary of State asked that he should be kept informed of the progress of the question of Russian Air Service5 m Afghanistan, The present position may be sunmarised as follows:- The Termez-Kabul service (vshich is supposed to operate once a week but is very irregular according to reports) is not covered by any agreement between the Russian and Afghan Government;. The Afghan Foreign Minister on 22nd August gave Sir R. Maconachie the follow ing information Under cover of discussing frontier postal arrangements the Soviet had aent a representative tp negotiate an agreement for a Russian /V Afghan/Afghan service between Tennez and Kabul; the Afghan Government had replied that they would prefer to organise a service in Afghan ^themselves if the financial prospects of an airmail across Afghanistan were favourable; they had however placed the Rue sin representative in touch with the Commandant of the Afghan Air Force (who had been instructed to raise all possible difficulties); the Russians had proposed a service from Kushk to Kandahar ae a alternative to that from Termez to Kabul and this was being discussed but there was no suggestion as yet that Russian machines should go beyond Kabul or Kandahar; the Foreign Minister had no information as to what connection was proposed at Kushk• The Foreign Minister added that the Afghan Government were determined to reject the Soviet proposals eventually after displaying sufficient interest to forestall the possibility of Russian propaganda to the effect that they were under British influence. Our telegram of 11th September suggested to the British Minister that he should do what is possible to draw the Afghans as to their intentions, taking the line ^of course^ that the Soviets real objects are not commercial but political and prejudicial to Afghan interests. Sir R. Maconachie reported in a telegram of 18th September that he had had frank discussions with the Prime Minister, the Foreign Minister and • ^ e Kmg;^ the air situation was unchanged ; but theU- Russo-Afghan relations were strained and that the present Afghan attitude is firai though a little nervous; the King gave a definite assurance that he would not agree to the operation of a Russian/ante Paper. Department. service east of Kabul or Kandahar. - h oUc~j yhe object of our is of course (1) to do anything that may be possible to exclude Russian Air Services from Afghan,and (2) in any case to prevent their intrusion into south^or easi^ Afghanistan i.e, beyond Kabul or Kandahar. We have in our favour the following factors, (a) the dislike and suspicion which the Afghans entertain for the Soviet# (which however might possibly be overcome by a sufficiently large bribe or by threatsand (b) the fact that in September 1930 Sir R. Maconaehie received a letter from the Afghan government agreeing that ; if they ever signed a convention with the Soviet for a Russo-Afghan air service^ convention on the same terns would be granted bo the British government should the latter desire it; this is interpreted to mean that if the Russians secure an agreement for a service to Kabul or to Kandahar we have the option of a corresponding service from Kabul or Kandahar to India. It follows from this that we have no interest (but rather the reverse) in taking the initiative to open up air canmunication with Afghani because this would facilitate the entry of the Russians on the other side;and it is our main object to avoid this. But if this could not be avoided, then we have an essential interest in securing that the Russian service -diri not penetrate into the south eastern zone. It thus depends on the course of events whether it will be necessary or desirable for us to take any action. Action will not be necessary unless the Afghan government/ ■3818a 5000 S.29Goveitment do actually enter into an agreement with Russia, and further unless they seem likely to go back on the; ' assurance now given by the King that he would not agree to a Russian service east of Kabul or Kandahar. On the other hand if both these contingencies materialise we shall have to be prepared to take up the option under our agreement of September 1920, i.e. to provide a British service in some form or another between Kandahar and Chaman (assuming that the threatened Russian service is on the Kushk-Kandahar line). In their Express letter of the 17th August and a telegram of 27th August, the Government of India intimated that as a purely stop-gap arrangement they could arrange a Quetta-’ty® Kandahar service once weekly at trifling expense ; provided that R.A.F. machines and personnel were used and only mails were carried; they elso suggested that it might be advisable to use air craft of a type which does not exist in India at present and they asked whether His Majesty's Government could provide such aircraft and crews (the reason of this suggestion is^l thinthat the Afghan govemment-whose consent would have to be obtained to the employment of service aircraft^ight be less likely to object if the aircraft wa® of a type not already, known on the Indian Frontier and therefore less likely to cause excitement in Afghanistan). After obtainSng the concurrence of the Foreign Office, we consulted the Air Ministry on this suggestion, among others, in a letter of 21et September. The Government of India also suggested that we should ascertain from Imperial Airways what they would charge for a service between Kandahar and Karachi. This IE a hypothetical question at present but we have con sulted the Air Ministry as to the desirability ofc. 'itt ante Paper. Department.

The Government of India alec asked for information as to the hypothetical time table of a Russian service from Europe to India across Afghanistan^ either by air all the way or by rail and air^in comparison with the time table of Imperial Airways. A certain amount of information has been collected from the Foreign Office and is being sent to India; the Air Ministry have also been asked for information. The object for which the Government of India desires this information is doubtless that^if it could be shown that the times taken for the Russian service are greater than those taken by Imperial Airways^ it would follow that there is little commercial advantage either to Afghanistan or Russ ia to - expected fr om the for mer ^TStHuade~the; Afghans fro, hl entering into an “agreement ancf this could be used as an argunentTwith the Russians^ since it would be clear that Afghanistan had little to gain and that^as Russia; had little to gain commercially either,her real object was not commercial. Both the General Post Office and the Government of India agree that the Indian Postal Administration would have to accept mails ior India delivwEed by a Russian air service at the Indo-Afghan frontier by the most rapid routes used for their own m$ils (which would be by rail at present),but that it would be under no obligation to forward mails from India by the Russian service. 7^, 414 * fanyJ- uLu ^ ^ jy\ b iJ/ig / j ft ■3818a 5000 8.29 A'U^LO &lt;(S f ^ y cJr 1' / n X 1 - ' ^ * /V ' N i' C/&amp; A' ^ x: K A 7^ fa / A-A 4 A f i ITQTH) 01: A rSlETING AT TK3 AIR IJIITISTHY of: 6TH OCTOBER 1951. Lord ?finterton saw Mr, Bullock at the Air Ministry to-day. Also present were Sir S. Dannreuther, Colonel SheImerdine and Mr. E.J. Turner. Lord Winterton referred to the regrettable position due to the decision of the Government of India to abandon for the present their projected Air Service and to sell the Avro 10*s recently bought for that Service, and he enquired whether the Air Ministry were able to suggest any step that could be taken in spite of this decision to establish a service across India, ... The Air Ministry representatives consiuerea wouxa be useless to suggest to Imperial Airways that they shouldoffar to run a service without a subsidy and also agreed that it would be useless to ask the Government of India for a subsidy on the scale that would be required for an Imperial Airways service. Col. Shelmerdine mentioned however that he had heard that Ta nj were thinking of offering to run a service of Puss Moths either without a subsidy or with a very small one. As regs.rds the question of temporarily allowing tne Butch to carry the internal mail and otner L,ramic in ^ndia Mr. Bullock said that this was quite contrary to the interests of the British Government, though he admitted it mignt nave to be seriously considered if it were put for..aid oy •‘.iMxa. An important objection to it was that it would lead residents in this country to send their letters to India cp u *~ e ^ service. . ^ , , . . As regards the possibility oi coming t - - arrangement with the Butch for a temporary division b two countries of the traffic between the United Kingdom nnu Australia !Ir. Bullock said that this would establish tne Butch in a position from which it would be very hard to dislodge them. ItIt was finally agreed that the best course would he to suggest to the Secretary of State for India that he should write privately to the Viceroy expressing his keen disappointment at the abandonment of the scheme and enquiring whether it would not be possible to devise a less expensive scheme that could be substituted for it. hr. Bullock suggested that the letter mi ^at say ”1 suppose there is no chance of an Inaian firm carrying the mails either for no subsidy or for a subsidy of a relatively trivial amount”. It was also agreed, on Lord Winterton f s suggestion that it would be well to suggest to the Viceroy that if it is decided finally that nothing can be done at present he shoula make a public statement to the effect that he greatly regrets that the financial position has made it temporarily impossible to proceed with the scheme and that he regards it as highly important to resume consideration of the matter as soon as times are better. As regards the interpretation of Article 35 of the International Air navigation Convention under which the nign contracting parties undertake ”to co-operate as far as possible in international measures concerning meteorology and wireless telegraphy (among other things), hr.Bullock agreed with ohe view that this does not impose any legal obligation that could be enforced - an important point in this connection being tuat the Convention does not oblige a contracting party to estaolisn aerodromes at all or to allow foreign services to croos its territory. He considered however that it would be most retrograde, unfriendly and in every way objectionable to close down the special meteorological^ and wireless organisation for aviation, &amp; na suggested that the Secretary of State should bring to wn^tev r pressure he could on the Government of India to prevent this. In this connection the Air Ministry representatives stressed the fact that the completion and maintenance oi the meteorological iy4meteorological and wireless organisation 'between Calcutta and Rangoon is the vita.l point, that 'between Karachi and Calcutta Toeing comparatively unimportant. In regard to this point also a private communication from the Secretary of State to the Viceroy was suggested. In regard to the service 'between Calcutta and Australia the Air Vinistry representatives reminded Lord Vinterton that the demand for a subsidy from Burma had now been reduced to £5,000. The scheme was however in abeyance because the Australians were not at present prepared to come into it and hr. Thomas had said that he could not back it in existing circumstances. The Air Vinistry representatives mentioned that in order to interest the Burmans in the matter it was porposed to arrange some flights for those in London for the Burma Hound x^ole Conference, and they seemed confident that the result of this would be that the £5,000 subsidy would be forthcoming as soon as Burma is separated from India. As regards the proposal of the Government of India to sell the Avro 10's the Air Ministry representatives said that for political reasons it is now prooaole that a service between India and Afghanistan, run with military nr chines, will be started before long; that the Avro 10's would be very suitable for this service; that the service machines now in India would not be s-*.it^.cle, the Government of India would not oe aolejto get otn~r oJ.ita service machines for any substantial cime without payment, that therefore their best policy might be to use the Avro 10's this purpose rather than to sell them. .Lora ifeintertoa s .iv. would take up this point with those concerned at the India Office with a view to any necessary communication being aau^ uo Inuia. Lord Winterton stated that he had suggested to t.ie Secretary of State for India that the question of safe guarding Imperial Air Communications through India should be carefully considered at the Hound Table Conference. The Air Ministry agreed that this was essential. maft Paper. 3 (V ' Jr ^ ^ r ^ ' Jj 8iu, Esq., &gt; ' UR MliHSTRY, Gwydyr House, S.f. 1. f-v ^ - a - - * Department.

Yours sincerely.NO TBS OK AIR SERVICES XN 'TURKESTAN Moscow * Kabul # Tha service between Kabul and Moscow actually falls into two sections as shown below, both of which, as far as is known, are operated with a fair degree of regularity, Kabu l- Tashkent . This section is operated in both directions on Sundays and .'ednesdays, both machines leaving at 0200 and arriving at their destinations at 10.25 Tashkent-Moscow . This section is operated in both directions between the 1st May and 30th June on even dates of the month only, and between 1st July and 30th September every day including Sundays. The trip occupies two days and at present leaves Tashkent at 3.30 and arrives at Moscow at 1500 on the second day. Tbs machines in the refers© direction leave Moscow at 8.10 and arrive at 1745 on the second day. Passengers are carried on both services and the fares ares Kabul-Tashkent 275 roubles single (approximately £29 at present rate of exchange) and Tashkent-Moscow 198 roubles single (approximately £21 at present rate of exchange). The relationship between these fares appears rather queer in the view of the fact that the distance between Kabul and Tashkent is about 700 miles as compared with nearly 1,900 miles between Tashkent and Moscow, but they are as given in the current German timetable and are, I think, fairly reliable. The journey would, ofcourse, be completed by the normal daily service from Moscow to Berlin and thence to London, the through fare from Moscow to London being £24.10. single or £49. return. As far as I know there are no through bookings for the whole journey between Kabul and London. Other services operating in Turkestan are as followsi- Tashkent - Alma Ata Daily including Sundays. Tashkent - Tschardschjui On even dates only. Tashkent - Ura-tyube - Stalinabad On even dates only. I jTashkent - Samarkand - Termes - Stalinabad Outwards on even dates, return on odd dates.

I r\ “.7 \ /f*. 0© L I am Sir, With reference to your letter of the 11th instant, I am directed by the Postmaster General to say, for the information of the Secretary of State for India, that he has received no intimation of any proposal by the Soviet Government to institute an air service between the Russo-Afghan and Indo-Afghan frontiers. As regards the other points mentioned in your letter, I to inform you that the opening by the Soviet and Afghan Governments of an air mail service to link up places in Soviet territory v/ith places within Afghanistan would in no way constitute a breach of the Postal Union Convention. Article 3 of the Detailed Regulations of the Convention, an extract from which is attached, provides that the Postal Administration of the country of origin has the right to prescribe the route by which its mails are to be sent, and any Postal Administration would therefore be at liberty, on payment of the appropriate charges, to make use of a Russo-Afghan air service, if one were established and notified as available, for the conveyance of its mails for India and for places beyond by air to Chaman and thence by ordinary means of transport. The 1 ; j Indian Post Office would, in the absence of internal legislation forbidding the entry of letters received from Afghanistan generally, be bound both to accept and deliver mails for India sent by the service, and to afford conveyance across India to closed transit mails for and from countries beyond. It would of course be at liberty to re fu se to use the s ervice for letters J ^CLOSURE !N WEEKLY TeTTER 1 No. 72 9 24SEP. 1931 u °uretary of State for Indiat OR TAf Y, POIXnu L AND Political Department, j SEG' El CERT, INDIA O^FIGJ INDIA OFFICE. ~ w Laiposted within India itself. So far as the question of charges is concerned, the normal procedure would be for the Soviet and Afghan Post Offices to notify the rate per kilogramme of mail carried which other Postal Administrations would have to pay for the use of the air service. The latter would thereupon fix a surcharge, sufficiently high to cover the extra transport charge demanded, on all letters intended for conveyance by the proposed route. Unless the Soviet Administration chose to run the service at a loss, for propaganda purposes, this special charge would probably be appreciable. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant,6 ■aft Paper. z. Department. V H.J.Se^our, Esq,, C.M.Gr., Foreign Office, ^v 1 ' V 15 SEP 193? Very many thanks for your letter of 9 September, No.N.5999/ 577/97 regarding the proposed Russian air service. The information bearing on a comparison of Russian and British services in respect of the time factor seems very valuable. It appears that the actual comparison which the Government of India have in mind is one between the Russian and British services with India (not Afghanistan) for a terminus. The commercial value to Afghanistan of a trans-continental service would presumably lie in the mails carried to India, and if it could be shown that such service for this purpose could not compete profitably with existing British services, such conclusion would Z tc L. iVvv-j afford an argument that Afghanistan \ has little to gain commercially from the Russian project and that / as Russia has little to gain either her real objects are other than commercial. It seems therefore that for the relevant comparison we have to add to the time taken ’ by a Russian service to Kandahar the time that would be taker! between that 35b :sooo 5.31r»-~ i I ! i that place and, say, Karachi and that we have to compare this total with the time taken by our own service to Karachi without adding to the latter the time that would be taken between Karachi and Kandahar. I, / &lt;j l m must cartain-by bear in mind the possibility that Imperial Airways may not be able to use the South Persia route after the end of next March. On the other hand there is the alternative of a route along the Arab shore of the Persian Gulf and^ though it is a pis aller from the commercial point of view and there are political objections to it, I imagine that this alternative would have to be adopted rather than to give up the commercial service to India altogether. 3 As regards paras.6 and 7 of the G. of 1*8. Express letter of 17 August, it is necessary to distinguish between what they say in these two paragraphs. The weekly service which they say they could maintain is a weekly service for mail^ only between Kandahar and Quetta &gt;&gt;v — ^‘-Machines ; it is pretty clear that the additional cost of such a service(135 aft Paper. Department. &gt; ^ H-, U*, n r** v /n • 4.*^w ^ ft J&amp;b 'Usy rKt ^ &lt;(y)^ ^ service would be fairly moderate. But as regards the larger and more distant prospect of a regular commercial service between Karachi and Kandahar (orKabul a.s you L suggest) which is dealt with in para.6 of their Express letter, if and when this is considered / the preliminary question that arise* at once for consideration is who would pay for such a service. Is there any prospect that H.M.O. ^ ^ ; 7 ikftf')/ ’ l ) b~] ), would pay or contribute? The Gr. of I. as you know are just as hard up as H.M.Gr. or even more so and there is the additional argument against their making any large payment which is stated in para.3 of their letter of 20 July 1931; they could hardly look the Legislative Assembly in the face if they paid for a service external to India of negligible commercial value at a time when they may be having to scrap or postpone popular projects of civil aviation within L*/~ tiLure - lj ”~ ju ' ^ ^-~V lndia it a elf ' ! 'W ^ Hi, ' A* ^ +4,i ^ We entirely share your view hat it is desirable to examine forthwith every possibility of aking up our option of a service betweenbetween India and Kandahar if the necessity of doing so arises. We ought to be ready with our plans y but whether or not it will be necessary to put any plan into execution of course depends on various contingencies. If the Afghan Government conclude an agreement with Russia and .if the Afghan Government also show any disposition to allow the Russians to fly beyond Kandahar to the Indian frontier then the question of taking up our option arises. At present our latest information is that contained in Maconachie's telegram No.15^ that the Afghan Foreign Minister stated that there was no suggestion as yet that Russian machines should go beyond Kabul or Kandahar. 7 y , ‘***-/*~i h* *sar /»_ a u 'Youps sincerely. |8W3.C'«^' TONFOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l. 9th September, 1931. (K 5999/577/97) Dear Walton We have been turning over in our minds the various possibilities there may be for countering in practical fashion the menace implied in the Russian proposal for an Air-Mail Route across Afghanistan from Kushk to Ghaman. We have been interested in this connexion by the suggestion (made in paragraphs 6 and 7 of the letter from the Government of India dated August 17th, of which you sent us a copy under cover of your letter PZ 5517/31 of August 31st), that a line might be operated by Imperial Airways Detween Karachi and Kandahar. We note that the Government of India think that, if His Majesty’s Government could provide the aircraft and the crews, the Governmenu o± India would be able to operate and undertake the necessary maintenance of a v/eekly service, at any iute^ betuecn ) &lt;/j ■J*c. ^ Quetta and Kandahar. It Walton, Esq., C.B. , M.C.It has occurred to us that if the operation of an air line from Karachi to Kandahar is a nractical possibility (and we see no reason why it should not be so), there would be a distinct advantage in extending such a line beyond Kandahar the whole way on to Kabul, via Ghazni if the Afghans can be induced to agree to this. The distance between Kabul and Kandahar seems to be less uhan unree .hundred miles, and the total distance ^rom Karachi go Kabul via Hyderabad, Sibi, Quetta, Chaman, Kandahar and Ghazni seems to work out at about nine hundred miles. We understand that one Indian Mail at nresent leaves Croydon at 8.30 a.m. on Saturdays, and reaches Karachi at 3.30 on the afternoon of the following Thursday. Presumably mails for Afghanistan could leave Karachi on the Thursday afternoon and reach Kabul at any rate some time the following Friday, making the total time^occrg ied between Lond on and Kabul a little more thanj-ix rr ' nis v;ould? we thihki' compare quite favourably in point of uime with any trans-Russia air service. WeWe do not know very much about air routes ia but no such routes are operated at present, at any rate in European Russia in the winter-time. The regular Air Mail from London to Moscow vi£t Berlin and Koenigsberg, for example, stops running in the winter. The time taken between the two capitals is thirty six hours when the machines are running. Prom Moscow to Kushk ~by ra il is estimated to take between five and six days, and another day, we assume, will' have to be allowed by air from Kushk to Kandahar. In other words, the time from London to Kandahar vid Moscow and Kushk would take at least peyen _and a half days, if the stretch between Moscow and the Afghan frontier is covered by train. If the Mo scow-Kushk stretch were operated b^ air, we understand that the total time occupied between London and Kandahar would be about five and a half days (i.e. Moscow-Kushk by air two to three days We' have, however, no time-table information about eitner railways or air lines in Russia, ana a member of our Embassy in Moscow, who happened to be here the other day, told us that it is almost impossible to ascertaineven locally the time at which trains etcetera are supposed to start. On the basis of the extremely vague calculations given above, you will see that an air mail route from London to Afghanistan vid Russia v/ould not have such a very great advantage in point of time over an air mail route to Afghanistan vid Karachi. On the other hand, we should not forget that Imperial Airways may not be able to use the South Persia route after next April, owing to the attitude now being taken up by the Persian Government. It is also of interest to note that, y/hile there are at present, to the best of our information, as stated above, no air routes operated in Soviet territory during the winter months, the Soviet Press has lately been very busy declaring that efforts must be made to keep the air routes open all the year round. To return to the proposed Karachi-Kabul route, it appears from the previous papers that the route as far as Kandahar could certainly be kept open all the year round (which seems not to be the casewith the Peshawar to Kabul route), and for all we know the stretch between Kandahar and Kabul may not be exposed to the climatic disadvantages which, we understand, apply to the country between Jallalabad and Kabul. If this Karachi-Kabul suggestion is feasible as an Anglo-Afghan arrangement (with Junkers if necessary, representing the Afghans) or even as a purely British enterprise, (assuming Afghan consent) it has the advantage of keeping the air routes of Eastern Afghanistan out of Russian hands, it can presumably be operated all the year round, and it links Kabul with our own existing long-distance air mail route to Europe. Hie Russians have already a service to Kabul, and one from Kusnx go Kanoahar, if run by Russians and not by the Afghans themselves or Junkers, would not presumably be any more deleterious to our interests than the existing Russian route between Termez and Kabul. I might add further that to the best of our understanding the suggested line between Rawalpindi and Kabul would be a purely a djioc line connecting with nothing but the railway at Rawalpindi. Ifthe Karaciii-Kabul line were to 'be established we could of course establish a line between Rawalpindi and Kabul as well, but this would only be a side show. Perhaps also the line between Karachi and Kandahar would not occasion quite the same difficulties under the Air Convention as the projected line from Rawalpindi to Kabul via Peshawar. idea? One general difficulty which will no doubt occur to you is that however temporarily in theory we may embark on operating any air line between India and Afghanistan we shall in fact be virtually committed to maintaining it, if we are not at least to lose more prestige than would be the case were the line never started. above have been worked out without expert advice - and it is therefore with some diffidence that we put them forward as a basis for discussion.

(a) of para. 2 is primarily addressed to Kabul, but we may be able at once to work out in an approximate manner how a Russian service (either rail and air, or alternatively all air) as far a.s the Indo-Afghan frontier would compare as regards the time factor with the British sea service via Bombay and air service via Karachi; to the time taken by such Russian services ?/e should apparently have to add (1) the time taken in handling mails on Afghan territory for retransmission by Indian rail, (7) the time taken in recosting them ^if our international obltjotions do not require us to cooperate in a tx-trough service, though requiring us to take on mails posted in Afghanistan) and (3) the time taken in forwarding in India. The F.O. are already at work on the hypothetical time table so far as data are availaole, and will doubtless also give such information as is available on question (c) in para.2 of the 0. of I's. letter. In the meantime a draft letter to the Air Ministry, referring in particular to paras.6 and 7 of the Gh of I’s. letter, is submitted.

Assuming that a Russian all-air service could deliver the same mails to Chaman in the same time, the rail journey from Chaman is of such a nature as to give a definite advantage to mail by Imperial Airways to Karachi. Moreover it is understood that an extension of night flying on the section between Cairo and Basra would shorten the distance by a may or half a day* We are not thus able to see that the Russian all-air service can promise any advantage in time or security over Imperial Airways, while the establishment by us of an air service between Chaman or Kandahar and Karachi Vi/uuld only add to trie attraction uf the Russian service and diminish the advantage which Imperial Airways now gets by the nature of the rail journey from Chaman to Karachi.

Department The Foreign Office entirely agree as to the importance of this question and the desirability of not leaving tbxe Afghan Government with the impression I that we should acquiesce in Russian air penetration | in the south-eastern zone. On a point of tactics they are somewhat ; inclined to doubt the suggestion in our draft telegram i that Nadir should be reminded of Amanullah*s promise | in 1926 that Russian members of the Afghan Air Force would not be allowed in the south-east. The reason of their doubt is that they think that Sir R.Maconachie might not find this a good argument to use, in view of the fact that in September 1930 the Afghan Government promised that if they gave the Russians a concession they would give us a corresponding one and the fact that we do not know whether we should be able to take up this option if the contingency arose. This question of tactics is one on which I think it would be desirable simply to ask for Sir R. Maconachie*s opinion.

Department. ► 3818a 5000 S.29 The history of this question up to 24 March, 1931, is suranarised in the precis of correspondence flagged on the file. Since that date the principal relevant developments have been as follows. In his telegram No. 90 of fay Sir R. Maconachie reported that Herr Bonatz, a G-erman who had comp to Kabul to reorganise the Afghan posts and telegraphs, had informed him of a scheme for sending letter mails from Europe to India and the East by rail through Russia to Tashkent or Termez, and thence by an air bridge over Afghanistan to the Indian frontier. On 18 Iky the Afghan Foreign Minister said that the scheme was still under his Govt.'s consideration and was not ready ^or discussion (Kabul telegram No. 107). On 3 June the foreign Minister stated that the Soviet Embassy were pressing for a renewal o^ their air agreement with the Afghan f ovt., and had indicatca that in case of refusal the sememe mentioned by Bonatz would be modified by the substitution of an air bridge over Persia to the Indian frontier instead of over Afghanistan. The v oreign Minister asked Sir R. Maconachie's advice, and the latter soated that H. . had apnarently no information regarding the scheme and suggested that the Afghan Govt, should not be bluffed into any particular dec is ion '•'V &lt; In his telegram of 20 June, Mo. 119, Sir R. ♦ Maconachie reported that he had received information from a German in clo^ touch with. Bonatz that the air bridge/ ■ Iifr bridge scheme had originated ni^h Bona^z, thet ^he latter had advised the Afghan Govt, to extract more favourable terrs from Junkers for the concession of an internal Afghan air service under negotiation with them; that the Afghan Ciovt. had accordingly held up the conclusion of their pending agreement with Junkers, and that the Afghan Govt, had been badly shaken by the Soviet threat reported in Kabul telegram No. 112 and were likely to rive a contract for the air bridge to the Soviet Govt. Herr Bonatz in advocating his scheme has represented that it had the support of the Bureau of the Universal Postal Union. It has been ascertained from Berne that Bonatz paid a courtesy visit to the 'Hirector of the Bureau before he proceeded to Afghanistan and made some reference to such a scheme, but nothing was said by anybody connected with the Bureau to indicate approval. I In his telegram of 9th August, Fo. 149, Sir R. Uaconachie reported the following information received from the German above referred to who is in close touch with Bonatz: that two Russian postal officials have arrived in Kabul to negotiate an agreement for a Russian ( air service from Kushk to Charnan, professedly for the » \ carriage of European mails; that they have told the Afghan Govt, that the Soviet Govt, have referred the proposal officially to the International Bureau at Berne; that the Afghan Govt, have stated their inability to accept the proposal, on the ground that they are already committed to Junkers, but that the Soviet Govt, are not likely to be satisfied with this reply, since it is generally known that the Afghan Govt, have suspended the conclusion of an agreement with Junkers. .L I ■nute Paper. nute Paper. ^SISa 5000 S.29 Department. $ know that the Afghan Oovt. are anxious to develop air communications in their country; they would prefer that this should be done if possible without the assistance of the Russians', but they are a^-aently attracted by t... 1 it y^oi 1 the tn ns- Afghanistan service and the share-m the receipts from such a service which would accrue to them. The attitude of the Government of India is governed by the following considerations W* 1 - ■“'V'-*' 1 '*’' a-r y ,-j /tuj.J Pol it i c a le on side rat i o ns /rnak e it import aim , if possible, to prevent a Russian service operating right up to the Durand line. But the severity o^ Inr financial crisis relegates these considerations to s secondary place and the Government of India would uou, in order to exclude Russians from access to the Indian -frontim', be able to exercise the option obtained by Sir R. Faconachie last September of a British service between India and Kabul, in the event of the Afghan.Govt. o~i i is -Sy* , renewing the Russian Tennez^Kabul concession^ The strategic risk of giving foreign (even Russian) aircraft access to the Indian frontier they no longer regard as vital so far as the Kabul-Imia route- is concerned, but es regards the Kushk-Chaman route i&gt;uey consider that a Russian service would constitute a military menace, and that even if the service stopped short of Chainan at Kandahar this menace wouldbe practically/ ■ . d /r i practically as great. Political considerations (which, however, the Cr. of I. are obliged to subordinate to financial) of course weigh against a Russian service to Chaman as well as against a Russian service from Kab'ul to the Khyber. These political objections would apply, at any rate to some extent, to a Russian service even as far as Kandahar. The strategic risks of a Kushk-Kandahar-Chaman service appear to the G. of I. so great that they suggest that in the last resort H.M.G. should provide the funds for the establishment of a British service over the sector Kandahar-Chaman. If it is admitted that the strategic risks of a Russian service on the Kandahar route are as grave as the G. of I. suggest, there would certainly appear to be a ca.se for asking H. T .G. to bear or contribute to the ; j cost of minimising those risks, since in the event of a war uesica military assistance fro: this country would with R kI§; ; presunably be required for the defence of India on that route. As regards the auction to be tak^n on Kabul | ' No. I v, the G. of I., in their telegram of 17 • ’ / August, suggest that as a first step Sir R.

Sir R. ? f aconachie could follow the general line suggested in para.. 7 of the G. of I.’s telegram. He could lay stress on the darger to Afghanistan itself of allowing the Russians to establish themselves in the manner threatened, and point out that- any pecuniary advantage would be negligible, especially as the scheme for the carnage of European mails to India would depend on the co operation of the r . of I.

Another point which might be made and which se&lt;■:; .s v■ ry rf 1 - yart is the 'ollowinr . \t the end of 1725, after a long telegraphic discussion regarding the employment of Russians in tin Afghan air force, Sir t. Humphrys was authorised to give an oral and informal warning to the Afghan Govt, that H.M.G. would regard very unfavourably flying by Russians in the vicinity of tme Ii d^-Afglm.n uoruer or anywhere east of Jalalabad or Ghazni or south east of Kandahar, and the presence of Russian air wersonnel m tin- ^astern, Southern, Ghazni or Kandahar Provinces except for carrying air mail for the Amir when on tour away from his capital (P. 4490/25). On 1 thrch, 1926, the Amir gave a solemn promise that Russian airmen r T 0 uld never b° a. 11 owed to visit Kandahar, Ghazni ^ i - Jalalabad except on temporary duty to carry mail to nnd from Kabul when hr war or. tour W.

(.77 i Kabul telegram No. 156 which has been received since the notes above were written puts a different aspect on the matter, as it appears to shew that Bonatz. is unreliable as a source of information, end indicates that the Afghan Government may be merely playing with the Russian proposals. But there are the dangers of the Soviet Government either offering a bribe (a financial guarantee apart from a share of the very problematical profits) or frightening the Afghan Government by threats into compliance. The Afghan Foreign Minister also stated that there is no suggestion as yet of Russian machines going beyond Kandahar, But if Kandahar were even the terminus of a Russian service, it would be bad enough. We might send a telegram in the sense of the attached draft, by telegraph or by bag. A draft letter to the General Post Office is also attached. «*l! i |Sir D.Bray. For favour of any observations.

Since the date of the latter there has been considerable discussion on the extent to which the Government of India would be free to exclude foreign aircraft in the event of the establishment of a civil airservice to Kabul. This question becomes of more academr interest if the Government of India 1 s conclusion reported in their air mail letter of 20th July, that for financial reasons they are unable to contemplate in present conditions a Kabul-India service is accepted; and while in order to clear the ground the points arising out of it which are under discussion on P.Z. 4552/31 might be taken up further with the Government of India in due course, they clearly now are not of any urgency. 2. The Government of India’s letter of 20th July sets out in detail their position as regards the Kabul-India route. It will be seen that H the unparalleled severity of financial crisis** has left them no option but ’’to relegate both political and strategic considerations to secondary plane’* (while they are prepared on the whole to face the strategic risks involved in the operation by foreigners of an air service between Kabul and the Indian frontier, they regard the political objections as of undiminished importance), and in these circumstances, even if negotiations with Junkers break down and an Air Convention between the Afghan Government and Russia materialises, they will not be able/ 1■■■■ able to take advantage of the Afghan undertaking (see paragraph 11 of the Precis flagged on P.Z. 1885/31) that we shall be granted a Convention on the same conditions. This conclusion has been reached with full appreciation of the fact that, as emphasised by Sir R. Maconachie in paragraph 5 of Kabul Memorandum 38 of 3rd March, 1931, on P.Z. 1885/31, if we fail to take an opportunity if one offers of anticipating foreign competition on the Kabul line, it may never recur. 3. It is exceedingly regrettable that the Government of India should feel that they have no option but to take this line. But the financial situation is admittedly critical and, as they point out in paragraph 3 of their ^toiogmnt if it should prove necessary to postpone indefinitely the question of an Indian State air service for reasons of economy, they would be placed in an intolerable position vis -a- vis the Indian public were they at the same time to bring into operation a sideline to Kabul, the commercial value of which would probably be negligible (and which in any case would have to be entrusted to an independent agency at a higher cost). In present conditions we have f clearly no choice, and there is nothing for it but to accept the Government of India*s conclusion, and to hope that, air developments in Afghanistan may to some extent play into our hands, and that Sir R. Maconachie may be able to take effective action (difficult as it is likely to be for him) on thelines suggested in the last two sentences of paragraph 6 of the Government of India’s letter. 4. A draft letter to the Air Ministry is submitted for consideration. We might in the meantime confirm by air mail that a copy of the Government of India’s letter to Sir R. Maconachie. a•aft Paper.

It will be seen that, owing to the unparalleled severity of the financial crisis with which they are faced, the Government of India, while the political objections seen by them to the operation by foreigners v of an air service from Kabul to the Indian frontier remain undiminished, feel that they have no option but to relegate both political and strategic considerations to a secondary place, and that they have decided that, even in the event of negotiations with Junkers breaking down and an Air Convention between the Afghan Government and Russia materialising, they will not be able to take advantage of the Afghan undertaking to grant a Convention on the same conditions to His Majesty's Government 3./ 35b 3000 5.313. The Secretary of State, thougi with great regret - more particularly view of the fact that, as the Goverme of India appreciate, the opportunity of anticipating foreign competition on the Kabul-India line, if not seized wh it offers, may never recur - cannot share the view of the Government of India that in the present critical financial situation and for the reason m nt n bub set out in their letter now under consideration, it is impossible furthe to consider the proposed Kabul-India a route, pending the restoration of financial stability in India; and he proposes, subject to any observations which the Air Council may have to offe to inform the Government of India that he reluctantly accepts their conclusic and to recommend to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs the issue of instructions to H.M.

Dear Laithwaite, With further reference to your letter P.Z. 3648/31 of the 11th June, we have now had a reply from Berne about Bonatz. It appears that on his appointment to his present position he paid a courtesy visit to the Director of the International Bureau, and made some reference to a scheme for an air mail service across Afghanistan. Nothing, however, was said by anybody connected with the Bureau to indicate approval of the scheme. This confirms the view expressed in my earlier letters that any claim made by Bonatz that he has the support of the International Bureau is absolutely without foundation As regards your telephone enquiry about the Termez - Kabul air service, I find that it was advertised in the * tf}/ r I930^edition) of the Liste des Lignes Aeriennes, etc. (Formlinute Paper. Department. ;!i f)) Please see previous submission on P.Z. 2829/31 below about the projected air mail service | across Afghanistan via Russia, Katodon 112 of 4th June, and the Government of India's telegram of 8th June on P.Z. 3648/31. Copy of demi-official correspond ence with the General Post Office (copies of which have been sent to the Foreign Office and to the Government of India) is attached. The Post Office tell me that the information contained in paragraph 1 of their letter of 17th June would automatically be received by the | Government of India, who themselves give particulars own of their/air mail services in the list (latest number issued in May 1931) circulated by the International Bureau. The Mo scow-Kabul, service has in fact a fairly long history. It seems to have started in CSflEflB) tfsk(*(2t 192® } and to have continued to function till the revolution. It was then presumably interrupteo. for a short time, but is now again operating. There is thus a W-OA L | certain basis for the establishment of av-(service from Europe to India through Russia and Afghanistan, j particularly in view of the fact that the German Government already advertise the ^oscow-Kabul s rvice in connection with their service from Berlin to ^scow. 11 1 [| fi'iTnr 5000 5/30 The information contained in Sir R. Maconachie’s telegram certainly goes to confirm his suggestion that the Soviet may be responsible for one scheme generally., aneh |t will be seen from Mr. Greenwood letter/ *^ ■■ a i letter of 17 th June that the Post Office are satisfied thpt Herr Bonatz's allegations in regard to the International Bureau are entirely unjustified, but that they are making, private enquiries of Berne and will let us know the result later. I think for the moment we might telegraph to the | Government of India and to Kabul as in the draft. As was — -w, •• ~ “ * to be expected, the Post Office are not in a position to amplify to any great extent the data on which their original opinion as to the impracticability o^ maintaining such a service without a surcharge was based. We might perhaps -also send an interim telegram to Sir R. Maconachie, approving the line he has taken with the Afghan Government. His position in the matter cannot be too easy, having regard to the pressure which the Soviet appear to be bringing to bear, and to thei allegations of Mr. Bonatz. Since the above was written, we have received Katodon 119, which supplements our knowledge in importart respects and makes the scheme appear very rmch more plausible. The Russians, if it went through and they controlled it, would secure the maintenance of their existing Kabul-Termez service, and would presumably, apatrb from that, be gainers financially firstly because a rail service Moscow-Tashkent linked with Kabul by an air bridge would presumably be much cheaper to maintain than the existing Moscow-Kabul all air service; secondly . because such a service, if it could carry mail from Berlin to India in eight days, might expect, more especially if (as suggested in Katodon 90 of 1st May, flagged) it could avoid a special air charge* to attract a very substantia]. volume/ cUf, *Department. volume of traffic ard to compete seriously with existing routes to India. From telephone conversation ; f with the G.P.O. I gather that it would be open to the Soviet to make a transit charge in respect of letters using such a service similar to that made by them in the case of the trans-Siberian letter service. The Afghan Government would, no doubt receive their share in respect of the Afghan section of the line. The Afghani have undertaken tna«, m Vra event of an agreement being reachedjff4rbiT^ Soviet for a service of Russiaji--and^Xf^an aeroplanes, a Conventi^n^n^fclie^same conditions shall be granted to 1 * GDveifBwnt,'JtoulA hiMiTi uu dujil'y: The Russian anxiety to oust Junkers and to conclude an agreement is -understandable in these circumstances, though the threat reported in paragraph 2 of Katodon 112 of 4th June that, if the Afghans were unresponsive, the sc he ne would l&gt;- modified so that mails would travel from the Indian frontier via Persia is probably merely a bluff. It would appear that the International Bureau is not actively considering this scheme, and an agreement would have to be negotiated with Persia before a through route xia Persia could be organised. From our own point of view it is not quite clear that we might not be better off with a service operated by the ■tfvir Soviet on the basis of a British operated line from Kabul to the Indian frontier than with a service operated by Junkers, possibly running to Dakka, where pressure might be brought to bear on us to agree to accept mails in uraijSx~&lt;, But for the moment/moment wg shs-ll do bsst to dr&amp;w th.6 Govgi n^iGnt of Ino. 18 , and, after discussion with Mr* Walton, a revised telegram is ' submitted.

I have reported these conversations, of which I took notes at the time, at considerable length, since they afford some indication of the attitude of King Nadir Shah s Government in regard to several (Questions of permanent importance. 3. The passages enclosed in brackets in the aide memoire drafted by me for the Prime Minister (Enclosure 2-B) are those which are omitted or sub stantially altered in the Foreign Minister’s reply (Enclosure 2-D) ; and so require brief notice. The omission of paragraph 1 of the draft aide memoire is explained in the notes of the conversations. As my instructions only required me to make clear the attitude of His Majesty’s Government in regard to the points men tioned in this paragraph 1, I saw no objection, once this had been done, to meeting the wishes of the Afghan Government in regard to it. King Nadir Shah’s proposal for the settlement of frontier questions by the Prime Minister and myself dropped out with the mention of the particular questions in con nection with which it was made, and would in any case probably be opposed by the Afghan Foreign Office. The omission of the passages marked in paragraphs 2 and 3 of the draft aide memoire is no doubt due to a desire to avoid definite commitments in regard to matters which are still in the future and circumstances which are still uncertain ; while it is characteristic of Afghan sensitiveness to decline to admit in writing the humiliating facts that the present Russian air service is covered by no agreement, but continues to operate in Afghan territory in spite of this irregularity. The expression “ Russian and Afghan Aeroplanes ” in paragraph 3 of the Foreign Minister’s reply (Enclosure 2-D), is to be read with the Prime Minis ter’s account of the negotiations pending with Junkers (Enclosure 1-B), and points to the intention of the Afghan Government to grant no concession in future for air services within their territory which would exclude participation, at any rate on paper, by themselves. 4. A copy of this despatch is being forwarded to the Secretary of State for India and to the Government of India. Enclosure No. 1(A) to His Majesty's Minister, Kabul's Despatch No. 63, dated the 9th September 1930. A Note of an audience with His Majesty King Nadir Shah on August 16th 1930. King Nadir Shah received me alone, and, after the conventional expen diture of time on unimportant topics, I said that with reference to the Foreign Minister’s application for assistance in the form of arms and money from His Majesty’s Government, I had been directed, while stating that my Govern ment accepted this request in principle, to say that they would be glad to receive information as to the objects for which the arms and money were required, and generally an indication of the future policy of the Afghan Government. While they were not attaching any conditions to their offer, they expected that it would be acknowledged by King Nadir Shah in the form of careful attention to what I had to say as regards their attitude and wishes. I promised that there was no question of a recurrent subsidy, and under stood that no such subsidy was desired, or would be accepted, by His Majesty, u it were offered. He confirmed this emphatically. I went on to explain that assistance was offered on this special occasion* m view of the special emergency which had arisen owing to the late revolu tion in Afghanistan. He said that he quite understood this.T nointed out that, although the Foreign Minister had suggested that His Maiestv’s Government had plenty of money and arms to give away this was 1 / the oase In England there was financial stringency, unemployment, heavy taxation. In India revenue had fallen heavily owing to the present civil disobedience campaign. He remarked that he was quite aware of this. T said that nevertheless His Majesty’s Government were able to offer substantial assistance which they considered to be sufficient if not to meet every requirement of Afghanistan, at any rate, to give the Afghan Govern- ment a very useful start in making their own way, and I hoped that His Majesty would admit that their attitude was a generous one. T also had to explain that their offer was not intended to buy Afghan friendship in'competition with another power. It was an expression of good will but real friendship could only be brought about by mutual confidence founded on experience of mutual good faith and observance of Treaty obliga- ions I pressed this point because the Foreign Minister s remarks to me had suggested that he was under a misapprehension in regard to it. His Majesty said he was very sorry that his Foreign Minister had taken the line which he had with me, and he quite appreciated my objections to it. The Foreign Minister had had no authority whatever, from either himself or his brother the Prime Minister, to take this line. He had been hungiy for assistance, and it was only the strength of his feelmgs which had led him a&amp;tra i went on to remind His Majesty that my Government had been billing to help Amanullah Khan, provided that they could be assured that the assistance given would be employed for a really useful P« r Po se - They had offered substantial assistance towards the improvement of the Kabul-handi Khana road. Amanullah Khan had demanded cash and a free hand m its expenditure ; the proposal had consequently fallen through. The attitude mv Government could not be regarded as unreasonable, since Mahmud Tam had himself told Sir Francis Humphrys that if he filled the void and save this to the Afghan Government for expenditure on the road, none of it would ever be spent for that P ur I&gt; ose - ment would be glad of a personal assurance from His ^^ “t b y which they now offered would not be spent, as money had been spen y Amanullah Khan, on— kept Uiwre^ I rtf® I I 'ma litlu lie imp road i pjtefa I tretklast fetiatitwou fiMerB' Biffin liidtieqn pit lean (1) luxuries such as Dar-ul-Aman, cinemas, etc., nor (2) on objects which were prejudicial to British mterests, I “™ ^ tenance of relations with our frontier tribes which were contay to the spirit of the Treaty and ordinary mternational practo.

V,. 66 His Majesty said that he entirely agreed with what I had said about Afghan frontier policy in the past. The only point on which I seemed to require an answer from him was that regarding the honorary rank recently granted to certain tribesmen. I knew, he said, why these had been given : for the simple reason that, at the time, there had been nothing else to give. A Divisional General who had no division was clearly ludicrous and, he would have thought, would consequently carry little weight with his fellow-tribes- men. However he accepted what I had said as the fact, and would assure me that his frontier policy was, and would, be entirely directed towards the maintenance of peace on both sides of the frontier and the avoidance of any thing to which His Majesty’s Government could reasonably object. The objects on which expenditure by the Afghan Government was urgent ly required were— (1) Reorganisation of the Army, including the formation of irregular bodies of Afghan tribesmen to be called up in time of special emergency as for the Koh-i-Daman rising ; “ but not ”, he added with a smile, “ in similar numbers ”. (2) The improvement of communications, particularly with India, by road ; and eventually, though he realised that this was a ques tion for the future, not the present, railways. (3) Frontier expenditure. It was the last which might arouse suspicion on the part of His Meajesty’s Government, but he assured me that such expenditure would be in no way prejudicial to British Interests, and in order to satisfy me on the point he hoped that it would be possible for the Prime Minister and myself to sit, as a sort of permanent commission, to deal with all frontier questions between the two Governments, as they arose. The Prime Minister would show me the Afghan frontier Budget, and would be ready to explain the object of any item regarding which I required information. Expenditure on luxuries in any form was out of the question for the Afghan Government, for at least six or seven years. I said that, as regards arms, my Government felt sure that anyone with His Majesty’s military experience and ability would realise the necessity of an efficient, well-paid, and contented army ; but they would be glad of an assur ance that the arms which they offered would go into efficient hands, and so be a real source of strength to the Central Government. In Amanullah Khan’s time the army had collapsed, not through lack of arms, but through neglect and financial starvation. His Majesty replied that it was hardly necessary, he hoped, for him to assure me that he fully realised the necessity of an efficient standing army. In reply to a conventional apology on my part, he said that he did not in the least resent the suggestions I had made because they all went to convince him of the goodwill of my Government in offering him advice which he en tirely agreed was in the best interest of Afghanistan. In Amanuliah Khan s time the army had received a net pay of three or four rupees a month, which was usually badly in arrears. It was given no honour in Amanullah Khan s eyes, and consequently the people had no respect for it. He asked me to con trast this policy with his own. The present pay of the troops was now twenty- five rupees a month (Afghani), and they were getting it regularly on the hrs of each succeeding month. In order to increase their prestige he was having w o other ranks of each unit to dine with him in rotation. He could as sui’e me that any arms given by His Majesty’s Government would go into good hands and would not fall, as in Amanullah Khan’s case, into the hands o unru y tribes. Amanullah Khan’s large purchases of arms had really, m the event, proved a grave source of embarrassment rather than strength to the en ra Government. King Nadir Shah went on to make a general declaration of the friendliness of his intentions towards His Majesty’s Government. This, he said, might De regarded in itself as mere empty words, but he might be able to convince ■ °f his sincerity by pointing out that friendship between the Afghan Govern ment and His Majesty’s Government was really a matter of necessity, since J69 B Note of an interview with His Highness Muhammad Hashim Khan, Prime Minister, on August 23rd, 1930.

Some time was taken over the attitude of His Majesty’s Government regarding Afghan frontier activities. I developed the point that even if the hostile intention underlying interference with our tribes was a thing of the past, the effects survived the original intention, and cited the instances of Saiyyid Almar and Saiyyid Kabir, and the use recently made of the standards given to the Afridis by King Nadir Shah and Muhammgd Hashim Khan him self at Hadda in 1920, as well as the honorary ranks recently conferred on Wazir hostiles. I said however that I had no authority to make any definite demands at the present juncture. He remarked that it was at such time as these when we had difficulties on the frontier, that the question should be discussed and cleared up. I replied it was not our difficulties which my Government had in mind, but those of Afghanistan. They did not wish to embarrass Afghanistan in the midst of these difficulties. I was directed however to make it clear that the attitude of my Government on this subject was fixed, and sooner or later the whole question would have to be discussed. At present it was a real obstacle in the way of closer relations between the two Governments. Muhammad Hashim said that he was willing to discuss it, but he would remind me that Afghanistan could not afford to quarrel with our frontier tribes. It was to these tribes that King Nadir Shah largely owed his recent success. They had saved him in fact from ruin. I said that this attitude was quite understood, and it was our tribes which had also helped Afghanistan in 1919. The whole question was difficult, and would be better reserved for future discussion. At present I was only authorised to make the attitude of my Government in regard to it clear. \\ ith regard to the loan he asked the same questions as King Nadir Shah and I gave the same replies. He added however that the King had understood that the five lakhs, which I had offered for immediate necessities, was additional to the £ 100 , 000 . I said that this was not so, and in any case His Majesty had said that it was not required. He asked if payment could be made in London, and I expressed regret that it could not. He remarked that he thought it would be awkward getting so much money up to Kabul; but I said that I did not see any difficulty in doing so, if it were drawn by drafts in instalments as required. With regard to the munitions he said the King had understood that 1,000 rounds per rifle would be supplied. I corrected this impression. Ar ^ e . P°i n f e( f out that 1,000 rounds was the ordinary scale per rifle in ^ ghamstan, and that the Afghan Government were very short of animuni laitiie 1 IkjftW ptyidentiraj T ofcoiei, loritjto lir rdinaP ere^ : With regard to air services I took the same line as I had with the King asking merely for information regarding the policy of the present Afghnl ’ Government. Muhammad Hashim said he would give me full information, and speaking with apparent frankness, said that the agreement with Russia for an air service between Kabul and the Russian border had been for two years, and this period had now expired. The Afghan Government did not like , this service; Russian machines came and went irregularly, and entirely as they pleased; sometimes there were no arrivals or departures for weeks together and at other times two machines would arrive at Kabul within a few days. The Russians always made technical excuses for not meeting Afghan wishes in regard to the operation of the service, and w T ould never carry passengers or messages, when this was urgently required by the Afghan Government, to such places as Kandahar, Herat, etc. The Afghan Government had conse quently, in Amanullah Khan’s time, decided to make an agreement with Junkers. This agreement had not yet been actually signed. Taumann* ought to have returned to Kabul three weeks after his departure, but nothing had yet been heard of him. The terms were still under consideration. For instance Junkers in their draft contract had stipulated for the cessation of the present Russian service but the Afghan Government, although they had no wish to continue the Russian service, declined to be dictated to in such a matter by Junkers, and had struck out this clause. This was one of the points still under dispute. On the other hand when M. Stark had pressed him to renew the Russian agreement Muhammad Hashim had refused, saying that the matter must await the conclusion of negotiations with Junkers. M. Stark had thereupon protested that the Prime Minister never met his wishes on any point and was an Anglophil, while the Junkers service would be really a British concern in disguise. Mohammad Hashim had replied that, whatever his personal feelings might be, as Prime Minister of Afghanistan he was merely out for the good of his country, and entirely impartial in his attitude towards all foreign Govern ments. He had never heard of any British participation in Junkers, but while at Moscow had come to know of Russian association with this firm, and had in fact visited the headquarters of a joint Russian and Junkers concern. The policy of the Afghan Government, His Highness went on, was to enter into a true partnership with Junkers ; either partner supplying two machines for the operation of a purely internal air service in Afghanistan to carry passengers and mails between Herat, Kandahar, Ghazni, Kabul and Basawal. Basawal had been chosen because it would be easier to make a landing ground there than at Dakka. In carrying out this policy the Afghan Government were entirely within their rights, and were not infringing those of any foreign Power. I thanked him for this interesting information, and with his permission offered one or two remarks. He had made the Afghan attitude in the matter quite clear, but I asked him to look at the question for a moment from the British point of view. My Government would not, I thought, agree to uiachines of a third Power crossing the Indian frontier from Afghanistan ; at any rate so long as their own machines were excluded from Afghan limits. For one thing, if such permission were given by my Government, British prestige among our frontier tribes would certainly suffer ; while they would also think that the exclusion of British machines from Afghanistan coupled with the admission of foreign machines from Afghanistan, showed that Anglo- Afghan friendship was more apparent than real. This would be undesirable from both the British and the Afghan point of view. His Highness said that he quite understood my argument, and declared hat the Afghan Government would never expect or ask permission for the Alghan-Junkers machines to cross the Indian frontier. The service would 6 en tirely internal to Afghanistan. I remarked that Junkers would certainly wish to connect such a service with the one they were already operating in Persia. *K a bul telegram No. 80, dated July 22 , 1930. (Serial No. 164 in Afghan Series, Part XXXIII.)that agreement was unlikely to be reached they were obliged, having accent ed me as His Majesty’s Minister here, to give me a civil and patient hearing* I was sure that on reflection he would not maintain the position he had taken up. Faiz Muhammad at once admitted that he had gone too far, and explained that he had only meant that agreement would be most improbable. If I insisted however the Afghan Government would of course be willing to hear whatever I had to say. They would however prefer that mention of these three points, allowances, jirgas, and Khassadars, should be left out of the aide memoire altogether. I said that I had no objection to meeting their wishes in the matter although I failed to see how the mention of these subjects in the way suggested could prejudice any views which they might hold. I would accordingly omit all mention of them and leave the paragraph as stating that they had taken note of the attitude of my Government in regard to certain frontier matters as explained by me, and would be ready to discuss them on a suitable occasion. His Excellency replied that he would ascertain whether the King and Prime Minister could accept this alteration. I remarked that I had gained the impression that the Prime Minister had been rather disappointed that the money could not be paid in sterling in London, and I had not quite understood the reason for his disappointment which I regretted. If, as stated in the draft aide memoire, the Afghan Gov ernment required money for extraordinary expenditure in Afghanistan, why were they so anxious for financial assistance to be given in London ? Faiz Muhammad, replied that it was for their normal expenditure in Europe, viz., upkeep of Legations, and expenses of Afghan students, that they had asked for payment in London. The next day he called again, and said that he had been up half the night with the Prime Minister discussing the first paragraph of my draft aide memoire. They had come to the conclusion that it would be far better to leave out this paragraph altogether. However correctly worded it was, and however harmless its actual meaning, it would give a handle to very awkward propaganda, especially at a time when King Nadir Shah was receiving material assistance from His Majesty’s Government, that his Government had, in some form or other, been bribed to give us concessions on the frontier. I was no doubt aware, His Excellency said, of the constant propaganda against King Nadir Shah spread by the Russian Embassy, that His Majesty had made a secret agreement with us on his way through India ; by certain tribesmen that he had sold Khost to us, and by the pro-Amanullah party that his policy was being dictated by the British Minister, and that he was nothing but a British puppet. All this propaganda gained credence from the King’s efforts to prevent participation by Afghan tribes in our frontier dis turbances, and from his present request for material assistance from His Majesty’s Government. This request itself involved serious risk to the Afghan Government, and it was only absolute necessity that forced them to make it at the present critical juncture. The Prime Minister however had authorised him to state orally that the Afghan Government had taken note of the attitude of my Government in regard to the subjects in question ; and would be ready to discuss them on a favourable occasion ; and in addition to give the following oral assurances : The Afghan Government would not summon tribesmen from the Indian side of the line to jirgas in Afghanistan, although if such tribesmen came they would have to be treated with the consi deration required by ordinary Pathan custom ; the Afghan Government would not employ Khassadars on the Indian side of the frontier, although, as already explained, tribesmen from that side of the frontier might be enlisted in their military forces and occasionally go on leave to their homes ; and that the whole frontier policy of the Afghan Government would beactuated by a desire for peace on both sides of the frontier and a spirit of true friendship towards His Majesty’s Government. The Afghan Government did not however ask my Government to accept such assurances as final, but to judge their actual policy on the Indian frontier by its results. They must however ask that none of these assurances should be required in writing, for the reasons already given, and that no mention of the subject should be made in the aide memoire. tsifltbi I agreed to delete the whole of the first paragraph. I mli 5 ; Faiz Muhammad then asked me to send him a letter stating that in regard as ^ to certain matters which had been discussed, I understood that the attitude gardtoJL 0 f the Afghan Government was as stated in paragraphs 2 and 3, and to ask for formal confirmation. at tk Piii w?

The Afghan Government have taken note of the statement made by the British Minister as to the attitude of His Britannic Majesty s Governmen in regard to certain frontier matters and in particular in regard to : (а) the payment of allowances by the Afghan Government to members of tribes residing on the Indian side of the Indio-Afghan fron rer • ( б ) the summoning of the members of such tribes by Afghan officials to jirgas ; and (c) the employment by the Afghan Government of members of sue tribes as Khassadars on the Indan side of the Indo- g an frontier. The Afghan Government are prepared to discuss such matters on a convenient occasion, and propose that in future the Prime Mims er o ie Afghan Government and the British Minister should sit as a commission for the settlement of all questions affecting the indo g a frontier which may arise between the two Governments.75 2 . The objects of extraordinary expenditure which the Afghan Govern ment have immediately in view are the reorganisation of their military forces on an efficient basis (the improvement of road communications particularly those towards India, and certain requirements along their frontier.) The Afghan Government have no intention of expending money on objects which would be prejudicial to British interests. 3 . As regards air services in Afghanistan, the Afghan Government have under* consideration the conclusion of a contract with Junkers for the trans port of passengers and mails (inside Afghanistan between Herat, Kandahar, Ghazni, Kabul and Basawal.) The Afghan Government do not expect and will not ask that His Britannic Majesty’s Government should give permission for the aeroplanes employed in this service to cross the frontier into India. (The Afghan Government have no agreement in force with the Govern ment of the U. S. S. R. regarding a Russian air service between Kabul and the Russian frontier, and the future operation of the present service between Kabul and the Russian frontier is dependent upon the result of the negotiations pending with Junkers.) The Afghan Government can however state that, if in future any concession were given to Russian aeroplanes to fly over any part of Afghan territory, a similar concession would be granted to British aeroplanes.

In the course of conversations which I have recently had with His Majesty King Muhammad Nadir Shah and His Highness the Prime Minister I have been given to understand that the attitude of the Afghan Government in regard to certain matters which came under discussion is as follows :— 1 . The objects of extraordinary expenditure which the Afghan Govern ment have immediately in view are the reorganisation of their military forces on an efficient basis, the improvement of road communications particularly those towards India, and certain requirements along their frontier. The Afghan Government have no intention of expending money on objects which would be prejudicial to British interests. 2. As regards air services in Afghanistan the Afghan Government have under consideration the conclusion of a contract with Junkers for the transport of passengers and mails inside Afghanistan between Herat, Kandahar, Ghazni, Kabul, and Basawal. The Afghan Government do not expect and wall not ask that His Britannic Majesty’s Government should give permission for the aeroplanes employed in this service to cross the frontier into India. The Afghan Government have no agreement in force with the ^ overi \’ ment of the U. S. S.

The Afghan Government can however s a^e that if in future any concession were given to Russian aeroplanes to ny oye any part of Afghan territory a similar concession would be granted to bn 1 aeroplanes. I have the honour to request that Your Excellency will kindly inf whether this is a correct statement of the attitude of the Afghan Govern in regard to these matters.

Dear L&amp;ithwaite, • With reference to your note of the 11th, I have examined the new list of air lines issued by the International Bureau, and find that Russia advertises a service Moscow - Tachkent - Kabul, operating twice weekly, of which the Termez - Kabul route is a part. ^ Russia charges other Administrations for the use of the Jlf ^service at the rate of 5 gold francs per 100 grammes (roughly l8/0d. per lb.) Germany also advertises this service in connexion with the Berlin - Moscow service and quotes a charge for air transmission Berlin - Kabul of 6.08 gold francs per 100 gr. (roughly 2l/l0d. per lb.), with an air fee of 50 pfennig per 10 grammes. This compares with their charge of 30 pfennig per 10 gramme s for air letter for Afghanistan sent by the Imperial Airways service. As regards the data for our opinion about the practicability ia ,‘ U',1 1 filler' •scant*;;practicability of maintaining an air service without a surcharge, it is, I think, common knowledge that there is no air company in the world which at the present time ^ is paying its way without a subsidy of some kind. I imagine &lt; that in a mountainous country like Afghanistan the technical difficulties of maintaining a regular air service are very serious and entail heavy expense. It follows that either the Governments maintaining the service must bear this expense themselves, or make special charges to all Postal Administrations which use the service, and in the latter case there is no doubt that the charge would be passed on f to the public in the form of an air fee. F 1 As regards the reference to the International Bureau, we are satisfied that Bonatz’s allegations are without 4I 1 foundation, but we are writing semi-off icially to Berne and I will write again as soon as we receive a reply.

The Bureau is simply a clearing house for the collection and distribution of information to members of the Postal Union and for the settlement of accounts, and has no initiative as regards the institution of enquiries into any subject. It has nothing whatever to do with the establishing of mail services which are the business of the individual Postal Administrations concerned and the Bureau would never dream of taking up such a question. I think there is equally little foundation for the allegation that the Postal Union was concerned in the appointment of Herr Bonatz to Afghanistan. We have no knowledgeknowledge of the man or of where he comes from. As regards the scheme itself, assuming flying to be possible in Northern Afghanistan, there seems to be no practical difficulty in the way of its introduction But it would obviously mean heavy expense and an elaborate technical organisation to ensure the regular working that is necessary for a mail service, and I don’t see the Governments concerned carrying ordinary mails without surcharge for long.

The Goveranent of India’s reply - copy of which is now attached - to the telegram sent on P.Z. 3576/31 is as anticipated by you. At the request of the Military Branch of the Air Ministry, the Government of India’s reply was informally discussed with them this afternoon. They indicated that they had previously regarded the Government of India as being willing, if necessary, to withdraw from the Air Convention ather than compromise on the question of abandoning prohibited areas or opening a corridor, and indicated that either course seemed to them open to objection. There were obvious objections to abandoning a prohibited area in the special conditions of the frontier. As for a corridor, even if reduced to the narrowest limits possible on paper it was impossible in practice to prevent ioreifii aircraft rom flying outside it once the tract of country which it traversed had been opened to them by it, and the politic 1 complications involved in salvaging foreign aircraft which crashed in tribal territory would inevitably be very serious. They were very anxious, if possible, to find in these circunstances some alternative course, though they appeared to recognise that, failing this, the v ovemmeno of India’s interpretation of the position, as stated in their present telegram, must be accepted ns correct. below. They agreed that this, if practicable, would afford satisfactory solution. But on further investigation of definitions in the Air Convention it appeared that 'private ate raft** covered all aircraft other than military aircraft aircraft employed solely for customs, post office or police paragraphs 2 and 3 of your I ventured to mention the suggestion put in 2 and 3 of vour note of 7th June on P.^. 3576/31 services/services. It would not, in other words, cover a passer^er service and wa could not therefore hope to avoid our difficulties in this way. The only escape which the Air linietry could see in the circumstances was that, the number of countries whose ratification of the Protocol was still outstanding being so small as nine, and none of these countries being actively interested in air matters (it subsequently proved that one of them was in fact Persia which, while not progressive in air natters, is quite likely to hold up ratification for a considerable period on general grounds), and all of them havin,* been urged at the last meeting of the Air Navigation Convention to expedite ratification, it was conceivable that we might be justified in taking the risk of regarding the Protocol as ratified and in force« 1 said that it seemed unlikely that our difficulties could be met along these lines but that in any case the point was one on which the foreign Office would have to advise. The Air l inistry, 1 understand, propose to take it up officially with us and with than. The Air Staff expressed their concern at the risk that, even if an opening was now to be given us for the establishment of a Kabul- India service, the Government of India’s retrenchment nolicy in the matter of civil aviation might lead to rejection of such an offer. They asked whether any indication could be given of the Government of india s attitude in such an event. I said that I was not xn position to make any statement. They further enquired whether, in the event of India being unwilling, for reasons of economy, to operate such a service herself, she would be oreparea to sgree to a foreign service operating from the frontier down into India. I said that, while I was not well qualified to speak as to this/13* thip, I thought, having regard to what I understood to be the attitude of the Government of India towards both foreign airways and Imperial Airways, it was almost out of the m^stion that they should so agree. It seems clear, both from the discussion reported above and from the content of the telegram itself, that the points raised in it have principally to do with civil aviation and could most suitably be dealt with in your Department. Subject to your concurrence, the telegram will therefore be transferred to you. &amp; (y(W, A UjJ d, *~**~-Q-^* —ifc- f £c(: f U Irii 3 f ,\ i t.Z. SECRET / aL*. w,,. W •vj $1Da h^t STP/AV.

This telegram is the first official indication we have had that the Government of India have apparently gone back on their former view that it would be possible to maintain a civil air service between Rawalpindi and Kabul consistently with excluding foreigners from flying over the prohibited areas which would be traversed by such a service. The substantial arguments by which the Government of India considered they could justify any international | challenge of such a discrimination are set out in their telegram of 27th July, 1930, No. 2519-S (?• 4837/30). That telegram appears to have been based largely on a note of 9th June, 1930, by their feogal■'Rc. mmih raI'icrT, on pages 35-38 of P. 5596/30. We felt in this Office that the arguments in question were rather specious, but the Foreign Office and Air Ministry, after discussion, displayed a general readiness to accept them. A note by Mr. Tymms, the new Director of Civil Aviation, dated 9th March, 1931 (P.Z. 2616/31: copies sent to Foreign Office, D.M.I.,and j Air Ministry on 28th April), for the first time suggested that the Government of India were resiling from this view and were disposed to accepo the proposition that the operation of a British 01 Indian service between Pindi and Kabul would invoice eiohei the abolition of the prohibited area or the declaration of a free corridor through the area, ihe Civil end Military branches of the Air Linistiy intimate tnat they remain strongly of opinion that discrimination can i be justified by the arguments put forward by the j Government of India last year, and that they do not acce pb/ ’ 3818 A 5000 S.20accept the views now expressed by Mr. Tyrnms. It will be desirable, in replying to the present telegram, to draw the Government of India on the question generally. If, as seems probable, they reply indicating their acceptance] of Mr. Tymms’s views, it would be open to the Air Ministry to comment on these officially. If in fact it were possible to justify discrimination on the lines originally contemplated, the difficulties anticipated in the present telegram would not arise, since there would be no question of a free corridor. But, even assuming the acceptance of Mr. Tymms’s views, it seems doubtful whether any reactions of the nature suggested by the Government of India rwsuli. In line the first place, the Kabul-Pindi/and the Persian air rout are not really parallel casesf Tkere is no practicable alternative to the Kabul-Pindi air route between Kabul and India; in the case of the Persian route there is already a satisfactory alternative, running down the Gulf and now well established as an international highway, to the Central Persian route proposed by the Persian Government If that route proves quite impracticable and no adequate modification of it can be secured, we should be in a position in the perhaps improbable event of the Persians using the argument suggested by the Government of India, to point to this and to press for reversion to the Gulf ro ute. .e are not yet in a position to say what physical difficulties may be anticipated on the Central Persian route suggested by the Persian Government. A preliminary survey is being undertaken by a representativs of Imperial Airways, and we may perhaps hope to have his report early next month. Prima facie . however, geographical/;inute Paper. 1)1 A 3000 A 30 (1Z&lt;Sc&gt; Department. geographical conditions appear most unfavourable on the ^esterr i sector (between Salar and Meshed - see map attached), where it will be necessary to fly across high mountain ranges and difficulties in connection with storage dumps for petrol, etc., may be expected. From the map the eastern sector from Isfahan to Gwattar would not appear to present corresponding difficulties, and this, if correct, would substantially reduce any probability of a Persian endeavour to suggest an alternative terminus to Gwattar for a Central Persian route, which would necessitate considering the opening of a corridor in Baluchistan. A draft telegram to the Government of India / m which the Civil and Military sides of the Air Ministry concur f is submitted. The Air Ministry were anxious oo make it clear in the telegram that they do not accept Mr. Tymms’s views on the question of a free coiridor, and that they still consider that discrimination could be justified by the arguments accepted last year. But, after discussion, they agree# not to press this point at the present stage, and to a,wait the Government of India’s reply. A minor modification suggested by them has been made at the beginning of paragraph 2 of the draft. Jlr* / Vo: fi cThe reply of the Government of India to the question in the first paragraph of the draft might he that the telegram of 27th July 1930 deals with the state of things that will exist if and when the Protocol of June 1929 comes into force, whereas Mr.Tymms’ note has reference to the existing state of things. I am not sure however that this would he a very conclusive reply, as I believe there is good reason to hope that the Protocol will come into force before very long. On the whole it might he hest for the telegram to issue as it stands rather than to incur delay by further discussion of its wording with the Air Ministry. 2. After the issue of the telegram it might he v*orth considering whether under the Convention in its present //y -r—“ form, it would not he possible to institute a regular British air service from Kabul to Rawalpindi without jpening a free corridor, provided no flights of British, lircraft not engaged in the regular air service were ever permitted along its line of route. The line of argument mild he that under the last sentence of Article 15 of tne Convention the Government of India could refuse to permit the establishment of any foreign air service along the route, and that under Article 3 they were entitled to refuse permission for isolated flights by foreign aircraft along the route because they were refusing permission for such isolated flights by British aircraft. 3 The Foreign Oflice in paragraph a of their letter of the 16th August 1930 - B.&amp; 0.634* - (and also I think in x it would be inconsistent with other places) have said that i ... . 4 . n -P rticle 3 to give permission for the the existing text ox ri-rxioie &amp; -1 -t-vi-i cj mnte bv certain specie*! running of a service along thi British aircraft while denying passage thereover to foreign aircraft; but I think they may never have considers mnss ibility/Kabul whil6 in base of Persia satisfactory alternative already exists x along Persian Gulf, for which we should 1)6 justified in pressing if physical difficulties of central route 'prove insuperable^} Apart from this ^while ^survey by Imperial Airways of Central 'Persian'route is still in progress and it is not yet^ possible'to speak definitely as to its'practicability, physical obstacles would' appear prina facie, to be greater in'western than in eastern sector and of Persian^ in any circumstances pressing' for route ending in Baluchistan seems very small. riskDraft Pap er - Department. c mm f ELEGRAl: : / Cypher XXX i*r From Secretary of State to Govt.

It is stated that these Sahzawari conscripts will serve in the Artillery. (h) Another batch of about 450 men conscripted in Nishapur are short- y due to arrive in Meshed for ser vice in the local garrison. H The Officer Commanding the Buj- turd Composite Regiment reports that 150men have been conscripted in the Bujnurd district and that they will be sent to Meshed on the. 15th April.

S. ^ 1X Russian refugees including one woman, who recently entered Persian territory near Lutfabad and who were returned to Soviet territory by the Amnieh Department have since re-entered Persia through Kalat-i- Nadiri. The Persian authorities, after in stituting enquiries about these refugees have permitted three men and the women of this party to proceed to Meshed under an Amnieh escort. (B) Soviet Affairs. 5. Soviet Commercial activities. (?) It is reported that a number of Meshed mer chants who had entered into business transactions with the Soviet Shark C om pany in Meshed before the introduction of the Trade Monopoly Law now find them selves considerably embarrassed owing to the partial non-delivery of goods sold to them by this Soviet Trading Company. These Persian merchants are reported to have petitioned the Governor General and also complained to Tehran against the business methods of this Soviet agency. {ii) The local Persian authorities are becoming apprehensive of the considerable number of Soviet subjects who have recent ly been arriving in Meshed in the guise of employees of the “ Shark” Company, They suspect that a large proportion of these men are in reality agents of the 0. G. P. U. Department. (Hi) The Bureau-Perse—a Soviet Trans port Company—has circulated a nctice to the effect that from the 22nd March 1931 the Soviet Mercantile Fleet will maintain a regular service of freight and passenger steamers plying between the Black Sea Ports, the Red Sea and Persian Gulf. The ports of call by these Soviet steamers in the Persian Gulf will be Bushire, Bandar-i- Abbad and Basra. Tickets for this Soviet steamship Company can be obtained in Meshed, 6. Alleged Soviet propaganda activities in Persia. —It is reported that certain pam phlets printed in Persian and addressed to the Communists of Persia have recently been discovered in Tehran. It is stated that the Persian Government after institut ing enquiries has come to the con clusion that the pamphlets were printed in the U. S. S. R. The Persian Ministry of education has sent a circular telegram to info# the heads of the provincial Education De- ^ partments instructing the latter to take :* steps to suppress all similar pamphlets propagating communism and ridiculing tV religion of the country. &amp; TliJ 7. Doctor Dumree alias Fridmee.- (Please see No. 18 in “ Black List” for warded to the General Staff under im No. 580, dated 3rd January 1931).

The Mamur-i-Kharjia of Herat who has visited the area of this recent raid is said to ■ 1 have expressed the opinion that this Jam shedi raid has been perpetrated at the f instigation of the Bolsheviks who supply the former with arms and give them every encouragement. He also ascertained that these Jamshedi raiders were m possession ol a machine gun. III.— Central Asiatic Bepublics. 11 The following information has boon obtained from an individual who left Guzar on the 16th March 1931 : * (i) Kolhozy .—Generally speaking these have proved to be a failure through out Tajikistan. During the past 14 months approximately 1,500 Tajik and Uzbek families have migrated into Afghanistan as a protest against the introduction ot this unpopular agrarian reform. It is reported that a nnmoer o Tajik families who last February were caught by the G. P. U. in t re act of escaping into Afghanistan were arrested and have since been deported from Turkestan. («) Food Shortage .—Owing to the Gov ernment degree to the effect t t&lt;i no cereals are to be cultivated m Tajikistan the shortage of tood grains is becoming more and more acute. The prices of food sold privately are soaring, while t ic State supply shops are unable o cope with the demands ot t e population. [eflipd snorted^ 12. The information given below has been obtained from an individual who left Katta Kurghan on the 19th Mareh 1931.— (i) Basmachi gangs have re-appeared in the area of Katta Kurghan since the commencement of March. In the opinion of the informant the strength of these Basmachi gangs will increase in the future as the people of Uzbekistan have now become desperate as a result of poverty and hunger. (ii) Kolhozy—redistribution of native fanners. —The native peasantry in the Kutta Kurghan district have so far showed little desire to be 44 collectivized ”. The autho rities have therefore deported some 300 families to Kirghizistan and have brought an equal number of Kirghiz farmers to Katta Kur ghan. The latter who have agreed to the collective farming policy are nevertheless showing little enthu siasm in this work. The Soviet authorities insist on the cultivation of cotton in this area to exclusion of all cereals. {Hi) Scale of Rations issued to workmen on 'payment :— Bread .. 2 Pounds a day. ]y[ ea t .. 3 Pounds a month.

The following information which is dated 14th March 1931 has been received from Dushambe:— W troub ]e taking place ia the Pamirs due to the introduc tion of collectivism” in that area ihe local native inhabitants who are reported to be partially armed refuse to be “'collectivised” and are offering considerable resist ance against the introduction of this system in their midst.

J* M ^ | P ' “ ‘ I jbH I have discussed with Se&lt;ir£a &amp;,1 fid L he points out/ one factor appears to have he y 10 ^ 1 ^ 1 ;of, viz, that it is not possi*bl© to operate a British or Indian service or to allow British or Indian aircraft to fly over the prohibit ed area of the North West Rentier. To do so will involve eituer uhe abolition of the prohibited area or the declara tion of a free corridor through the area. Sither would permit the flight of aircraft having the nationality of contracting states, on the same terms. In view oi the more favourable financial estimate now made possible by the decision to inaugurate a State Air Service from Karachi to Delhi, and with the hope that it ma^ be possible to find the necessary funds to emfcarls: on such a service, it seems a great pity that the prohibited area difficulty should prove the insurmountable obstacle. I venture (with diffidence in view of my unfamiliarity with t problem) to suggest that the difficulty might be got over with no loss of security by rigorous administrative measure^ I start from the premise that Hie only action which can now be taken against an evilly disposed person violating the prohibited area from across the frontier, is either to attack the aeroplane or subsequently to make a diplomatic protest, the latter only if the aeroplane can be recognised. If therefore a corridor of entry 5 miles in width were declared along the Khyber Pass, the position outside this corridor would be unaffected. The opening of this corridor could be made conditional on obtaining a special permit in writing from the Governor-(General, which permit would oq.ua required for British or Indian aircraft and for those longing to other signatories of the International i33i 7 ^1 r9ntion * The oorrlaor ’ Bould not be opsn t0 aircraft of ; ;,d^Pther nationalities.

Ihe permit, when granted, would be subject to the condition that no cameras, arms, (or other articles specified) would be carried and that tb the aeroplane would land at an appointed aerodromje whether Inward or outward bou^d, for examination by the military or other authorities. Subject to these conditions, it does not seem to me that a foreign civil aircraft flying over the prescribed route (ami even at prescribed times) could do very much harm, as I said before, there is very little now to stop an evilly dis posed person from doing the harm he may intend, I submit the following comments and figures with regard to the alternative methods of operation# It will bo appreciated that I have &amp;ot yet had time to study this problem thoroughly and for this reason and the fact that a considerable time must elapse before I am in posses si on of all the technical data which is essential to make a fully considered recommendation, my comments an in broad terms and my figures on an approximate basis, intended only to shew the order of expend!I k. re involved. No doubt it will be preferred that this should be available for preliminary consideration rather than uhat the whole thing should b® delayed. As examples of two important items of data which are necessary to determine the type on machine suitable, II may mention (a) detailed performance figures of the aircraft at high altitudes (h) relative density of the atmosphere at the various landing places, I shall also glean much essential information from the doyal Air ?orce 'before finally endorsing a particular recommenda-’ tion. With these points in mind, however, I recommend certain types of machines which may he considered for this purpose, most of which, with some reduction of load perhaps, should he capable of carrying out this service* I then examine the cost of operating these aircraft, as an independent service on a twice weekly and weekly basis following the lines of my predecessor's estimate at p#13 of notes, I then given an estimate of th© cost of operating the service as a branch of the Indian state Air Service from Karachi to Calcutta, but for th© moment do not provide for the operation of the link Delhi- Bawalpindl 9 since I gather that this lo not particularly required. Single-engined, X am asked to give an estimate on the basis of a single engined machine. Precise data is not available hut the machine I would select for this purpose is the Arro Trainer fitted with a 230 h.p, Arm strong Siddeley lynx engine* This machine has a very good performance ana I do not doubt will m.ev the exae1i ing requirements of this route. It is normally &amp; two seater and probably for this purpose should be restricted to carrying mails. Its price is nou more ^.ai ijS00 °* I must emphasise however that I am strongly oppose! to the operation of single engined aircraft on a route such as this* iVin-^inea aircraft Tbe A*0.0. recommend* consideration of tsrln-engined typos, i '-•'•U know of two such which can maintain on one 0S6 ^® 8 ^y haGloster A 3 31 (Surrey machine) and the Vicicere V'ellore, Both, however, have exceptionally good performance due to surplus power, the Gloster A 8 31 maintaining a height of 8000-9000 feet on one engine and the Vellore about 4000-6000 feet* Without this qualification twin engined aircraft have limited / virtues, and to obtain it they are necessarily expensive in power* The aioster._JLG... 31.* is fitted with 2-485 H*P* Bristol JUpfcter engines* It is produced as a passenger carrier with a cabin for about 8 passengers* Its cost is £ 14000 Including engines* I do not estimate for this in view of Its cost* The Viclcers Vellore is also fitted with 2-485 H* P* Bristol Jupiter Engines* It is designed as a fast mail carrier (top speed 137 fufuh approx) and its cabin is not designed or suitable for carrying passengers* The Air Ministry have one and Vickers limited another which could be acquired cheaply# I put the cost at £#9500 including engines* I do not recommend either of these machines for this route, the 01 os ter as being altogether too expensive and the Vellore as being much too big and high powered a machine to carry the quantity of mail and freight, which I understand is likely to be available on this route# Nevertheless I have estimated In my rough estimates for the Vellore as a twin engined type# aircraft*. I do not think the question of the three engined aircraft has been exhausted, beeuase only one high powered type has been considered# he estimates may be reduced by adopting a smaller o-engined tm* The Avro 10 is a 10 seater passangar carrier fx Ued with 3-230 h.p# Armstrong diddeley Lynx engines# its price ^ith accessories is under £3500* The ge at land WeagejC la a 4 seater passenger carrier Armstrong Sl&amp;UMr Genet Major engines • fitted isith 5 -110 h.p.engines. Its price is under £5000. Both of these aircraft will maintain height on full load with one engine cut out, hut not at any great altitude (say 2000-5000 feet)# There ia no machine existing, however, which will fly level at the height quoted as having to he crossed, via., 12000 ft. For this service to achieve some greater measure of safety, it would probably ho necessary to restrict the Avro 10 to the equivalent of 6 passengers an&amp; the Wessex to the equivalent of 5 passengers. ftlackhum l.Q„.s eater ^ There is one further possibility in three engined aircraft, which may he considered for the future only, if experience shews that the service is popular worth maintaining ana if, as I expect may be the case, It is found desirable to use aircraft of improved performance. Two aircraft are now being built for the Air Ministry by the Blackburn Aeroplane Company limited intended for operation at High altitudes, such as on the African plateau or this route. One ia a biplane and the other a monoplane, but they are otherwise Identical, having cabins for 10 passengers# They are fitted with 3 Armstrong diddeley Aynx Supercharged engines of 230 h.p. each, rixese ai^cralt „aould be able to carry the full load of 10 passengers ou uho - Indi Kabul route. Further they will be the most up bo late as regards heating, lighting, ventilation, sound proofing and internal decoration and comfort, f rob ably a better otanda 1 than Is required on this route, but a good advertisement for British aircraft 3 The pidee for these experimental aircraft is ,11000 each, but we could probably get them on reasonable t€ from the Air Ministry on the basis of testing Aiom un a r which is suitable for this purpose. This however is a matter for the future not Immediate present.

The Intention of this column is to shew tow far short of meeting expenditure the maximum possible ^ revenue falls, 0* To the capital expenditure should he added in every case the cost of ground ox^ganisation, which I take without farther investigation from folonel Shelmerdine^s estimate at MA lakhs. The comparison of revenue which it is possible to earn suggests that it mi^ht be desirable to reconsider the basis of fares proposed. It also brings out forciblf how un- eccnoTrical it is to operate a weekly service (rather than a iwe intensive service}, where the ratio of overheads to operating costs become?? so high, particularly if the service is run as an entirely a a If-con tain ad undertaking.

One might well save something, if not much, on a completely revised estimate for single engined aircraft. I purposely however am not spending time on this - investigation, because in view of the decision which has been taken, since the original estimates were prepared, to operate the Indian State -dr Service from Karachi to Calcutta with Avro 10 aircraft, it is clear that operation of the Pindl-Kabul sorvice as a branch of this service is at once the most t practicable and the most economical. r argument in its favour is that the Av.ro 10 is, at least, not the most unsuitable of the aircraft under discussion, I do not however read the instruction that it xs particularly desired to operate the section between &gt;elai and Rawalpindi. In fact, I gather that the ultimate aim, if an when the service proves itself of value, should oe to extend direct from Rawalpindi to Karachi. This however is a matter for the .future, and my revised estimate is based on precisely the same service Rawalpinll-Xabul as the original estimate, f,ven though the aircraft and staff on this route are separated from the main air route an- ba8to ** ‘ &gt;elh * and although It will be necessary to allow xor a certain amount of dead flying from Delhi to Rawalpindi year to provide for redistribution of aircraft reliefs, etc., it is possible to make very considerable reduction* by working as one organisation, under the headings -Purchase of, aircraft and spares; workshop eauipment; in—,oe; depre ciation and obsolescence; ma»aserl»l expenses} pil» ; mechanical staff* 4 .** the servi o© is ^ My revised estimate f^ ' ««»«, for «. ■»*“* “ 41U “ of ono aircraft, one pilot, certain neenanlcal sta | _ a n ,.^r. r 0 S , tools and aerodrome the necessary increase i&amp; $ 4 ,** reductions can be shewn equipment. Since considerable rexu „ aaV ri v service wit* its without reducing the service to a - ' . j nn vr fi sx) onaiXMcorresponding heavy handicap, I put forward the estimate on a twice weekly basis as originally proposed. !m© complete estimates for the Kar ac hi - 0 a 1 cu 11 a service are on another file, and I do not think it is worth while bringing then on ft this file at this stage.

Draft telegram to G.of X. inviting further expression of their views in the light of Minister’s comments. A- ^ f ^mte Paper. Department. 5000 5.27 The previous history of this question is given in the precis of correspondence attached. The views of the Government of India on future policy are given in their letter of 16th February bn .P .Z .1184/31 which should he read w T ith their telegram of 24th March, P.Z.1799/31 and with the criticisms of the Minister at Kabul (P.Z.1885). 2. The Government of India,’ for the ’’financial and political” reasons which actuated them last summer(paras. 7-9 of precis) remain anxious f o r a moratorium as regards air development in E .Afghanistan, and urge that the Minister should aim at this. Their policy is to wait on events, and decide on a line only in the light of the outcome of the ^unk&amp;r negotiations and the Afghan reaction thereto . Meanwhile they propose to confine themselves to investigating what economies can be made in the draft project for a civil air service, if and when circumstances force them to adopt this. 3. The Minister, whose arguments have considerable force, regards it as quite impracticable for political and other reasons to press for the moratorium. Ihe rate of development of air services in Afghanistan must in his view be left entirely to the discretion of the Afghan Government. With this view, pr i ma facie , one is disposed to agree. 4-, Mr. Maconachie further urges (with reference to the departmental noting in the Government of India of which copies are on P.5596/30 si* see especially passages marked B on pp.11,12, and 20) that the proposed air service to ' a strategical as well as a political value; and finally, yj, 1 . 3 ;/ tj.jjs opportunity for i ts adoption may occur^ at short notice and, if not seized immediately, may never occur again. This/tm This is essentially the point which the Air Ministry have in view in their letter of 6th November on P .7807/|30. The importance of 'being able to respond quickly to an Afghan demarche is emphasized by the Ministr f s suggestion that in the circumstances described in para, of his memorandum, on extension eastv/ard of the present Russian service is not inconceivable (neither the terms of the convention between Mr. Maconachie and the Afghan Prime Minister reported in para.30 on p.8 of P.6925/30* nor the notes subsequently exchanged (Enel. 2D on p.12 j of P. 6925/30)would preclude this, whatever may have been in the minds of the negotiators). The explanation of the Government of India’s attitude is no doubt the present acute financial stringency. But it seems very doubtlul whether the balance of advantage does not rest with facing the difficulties involved (which might admit of solution on the basis suggested in para.8 of Mr; Maconachie’s memorandum on P # Z .IBSb-though the cut in the Army contract budget now contemplated will make the Army Department even less likely to respond than it would in any case have been): accepting the principle of a civil air service (whether on the 1928 basis - see P.4607/28,j and para. 2 of the precis; or in the modified form referred to in para. 5 of the Government of India’s letter of 16th February, which should however be read with paras. 9 and 10 of the Minister’s memorandum); and, in the light of that decision, giving the Minister authority to respond to any Afghan overture on the basi of a stop gap service of short duration operated by the Royal Air Force (The Government of India are correct it their telegram of 24th March in stating that they have never conterrgplated a temporary Royal Air Force service save for a short period, and on the understanding that a civil air service should first have been accepted in principle/•iStjy iute Paper.

'The differences between the Minister and the Government of India are substantial and important; there is always the risk that we may be confronted with an Afghan move to which it- will be desirable to respond without delays and I suggest that we might telegraph as in the draft - though it will be for consideration whether the Secretary of State should give a lead as suggested in the manuscript addition thereto.

The establishment and maintenance of a civil air service under British control between Kabul and Peshawar, conducted by British pilots c.nd subsidised by the Government of India, was one of the forms of material assistance to the Afghan Government recommended by Sir B 5 .Humphrys o:.nd considered by the Defence of India^of the m I9r7. The outline of th6 scheme then proposed by the Air Ministry is given in pp.453- 55 of the papers atta ched to the Sub-Coromi ttee* s report. On the proposal itself the Beport of the Sub-Committee (p.17, para. 53( e);,remarked*.— It n would, we think have the great advantage of ousting the Busso-Afghan Air Force... and would give British pilots experience of regular flying over Afghan territory. There is, however, this practical difficulty, that the Legislative Assembly might not be willing to vote the necessary funds for a flying service of this kind. We attach great importance to the proposal, and trust that it will be possible to overcome this difficulty. Here again,however, the initiative must come from the Amir . u 2. The recommendations of the C.t.B. were generally accepted by the Government of India, ■ bo reported in September 1928 that they contemplated financing the Kabul India. Air Service as a political measure out of the subsidy in kind. (It had meanwhile been calculated that a bi-weekly service in each direction between Rawalpindi&gt;,4607/28. 'I tel .17273 26.8.28 :638/28. tul Hemorendum • 38,para.9. 4273/30. Rawalpindi-Peshawar-Jalalabad and Kabul, to be operated by P.H.66 M Hercules M aircraft (three 'Jupiter VI' engines), on the basis that it would be possible to fly the through route fran Rawalpindi to Kabul for 44 weeks in the year, an d that for the remaining eight weeks the route would be restricted, owing to snow at Kabul, to Rawalpindi to Jalalabad, would involve a capital expenditure of £60,000, and an annual expenditure on standing charges and running costs of £43,000. It was thought unsafe to estimate yearly receipts at more than Rs.l lakh (say £7,500) to start with. 3. No substantial progress had been made with the project on the fall of Amanulla, ana it remained in abeyance until the resumption of diplomatic relations on the accession of Nadir Shah. The general policy to be adopted with tne new regime in regard to it was however the suoject of much discussion,w T ith particular reference to the question ofthe practicability, in view of the terms of Article III of the International Air Convention, of allowing the private aircraft of other signatory states to fly over the prohibited area of the North West Frontier Province if private British aircraft were allowed to do so as part of a Kabul India Service. 4. On 14 June 19 30 Mr. Maconachie reported that on 13 May he had received a private hinthint that the Afghan Government might he willing to consider a proposal for an air service between Kabul and India if put forward by him, but that in the absence of a decision on the interpretation of Article 3 of the Convention he had been 5. The matter became of immediate urgency in July 19 30 in connection with the conditions to be attached to the proposed grant of material assistance to Afghanistan The Government of India then indicated that in return for the assistance contemplated J0.2364S of July 1930 4739/30) . they would inter alia , 'expect Afghan Government to meet us over development of aerial communications to extent: of refusing concessions to any foreign concern on Kabul-Dakka line, or similar line Eastwards from Kandahar, and granting Its priority of option of monopoly of operation in this zone.' 7. They added that the opening of a Kabul India line 'in preference to other lines in India on which development is urgently needed on commercial grounds, as against purely political grounds, is likely to arouse adverse criticism here. There are also obvious objections to devoting money to this project at the time of special financial stringency, when expenditure on nation building services has to be restricted. Project is therefore open to objection on financial and other grounds, and we should prefer that for limited period no action should be taken by any +r, r'pvelon air communications from Kabul Be stwards8. In these circumstances they urged that the Minister should endeavour to secure either (a) a moratoriums or (b) “priority of option as above, in which case he would have full authority to negotiate on basis of twice weekly service between Rawalpindi and Kabul. In this event, stand provided Radir agrees, we would be prepared to consider (? bridging) gap that must intervene before complete civil service can be established by utilising the R.A.R. for occasional conveyance of mails and passengers. We understand that Nadir is set on developing air communications, and if he really means business and insists on development in the nea.r future (• for good reasons), we may have to abandon our plea for the present inactivity and press instead for monopoly of control of air communications between E. Afghanistan and India and the exclusion of all foreigners. In this connection (. it should not) necessarily include Afghans”. 9. h*M*G. approved generally the proposals of the Government of India and the Minister was instructed accordingly. It proved however that negotiations between the Afghan Government and Junkers had already gone too far, and he was obliged to content himself with an undertaking that permission;would not be asked for Junker machines to cross the frontier into India in J the event of an agreement being arrived at between &gt;n 129 of 6th ^ Junkers and the Afghan Government, and that if in .1930 P.5985/30. ?uture any agreement was made with Russia for Russian and Afghan machines to operate over Afghan territory, the Afghan Government would be ready to make an agreement in similar terms with12 . 10. In the course of the discussions with the Prime Minister on the subject, the latter remarked (a) that n the Afghan Government would never expect or ask permission for the Afghan Junkers machines to cross the Indian frontier. The Service would be entirely internal to Afghanistan. M (b) 'that if the Junkers contract fell through he did not know what would happen, but could state that if any concession were given to Russian machines in future to fly over any part of Afghan territory, a similar concession would be granted to British machines”. 11, The terms of the agreement actually secured from the Afghan Government (efforts to secure a more categorical or detailed wording ha/virg proved unsuccessful)were as follows:- 2.

Further enquiry at first suggested that there was no foundation for the alleged breakdown of negotiations between Junkers and the Afghan Government. But on 15th February 1931 the Minister telegraphed that he was H informed by Foreign Minister that no agreemerfc has been reached with Junkersj’and that, in his opinion, questions of finance may cause failure of the negotiations. M The Government of Indja was therefore asked on 24th February to telegraph their views on the Air Ministry proposal described in para.13 above. 15. Meanwhile the Government of India had on 16th February addressed the Secretary of State for India by mail on the general question. They again expressed satisfaction with the results secured by the Minister, but enquired whether the second undertaking given by the Afghans (para.11 above) meant that 'if tne Russians are given the concession of establishing gt service to Kabul, H.M.G. will be given an opportunity of securing a similar concession. The Government of India understand that there is no question of a Russian service other than to Kabul; if such a service were proposed, e.g.to Basawal, the granting of a 'similar concession' would seem to be meaningless • 16 . On the question of policy, they urged that, for the financial and political reasons stated in their telegram of 22nd July (paras.6-8 above) 'the force of which has not decreased sine thatG.of I. to S/S for I. Uo.879S of 24/5/31 P.Z.1799/31. that date”, the Minister should ^continue to aim at avoidance of any financial commitments in this respect, and generally at delaying a decision hy the Afghan Government in matters of air policy as long as possible*'. They added that with a vim to reducing the commitmenti if unavoidable, to a minimum, they were re-examining the estimates of 1928 (para.2 above), and working out (a) an alternative scheme on the basis of a weekly instead of a bi-weekly service, 1 , and operated by single or twinengined instead of three engined machines. (b) the extent to which expenditure might be still further reduced by establishing the proposed Indo-Afghan Service as part of a possible future extension of the existing Karachi Delhi service. 17. On 24th March they telegraphed, in reply to the Secretary of State’s request of 24th February (para.14 above) for their views on the proposal in the Air Ministry letter of 6th November (para.ll above), that the commitments of the R.A.F. were such in their view as to ml® it undesirable that it should undertake Kabul service for an indefinite period; they had therefore never regarded the proposal for an R.A.F. Service as anything but a temporary stopgap, or contemplated the suggestion being put to the Afghans until a definite decision had been reached as to the early institution of a civil line. If the Junker negotiations fell through, the Afghans would presumably seek to renew 7 if Irenew the agreement with Russia, in which case His Majesty 1 s Government would have an option of agreement on similar terms. 'But there is no certainty that Afghan Government will move early in this matter; indeed, they may possibly consider ft in their interest to allow existing irregular arrangements to continue for some time to come. We should therefore prefer to wait on events and make no offer of R.A.R.service until arrangements for replacing it by civil air service are definitely in train.”totes- flinute Papor, * r s H' ^ , tqtl ^ SECRET.

Present attitude of Government of India, m light of discussion with Mr. Maconachie as regards establishment of a civil air service between India and Afghanistan. Copy of to 1 devious Papers - 4475b 1000 5.30 FOR INFORMATION. This interesting statement of the present position of the Government of India again emphasises their satisfaction with the results secured by Mr. Maconachie in his discussions of this subject with the Afghan Government last summer. 2- As regards the first of the two undertakings entered into by the Afghan Government, viz ., that in the event of their negotiations with Junkers fructifying, permission will not be requested for Junkers aeroplanes to fly over Indian soil, the Government of India, while recognising that it falls short of their main present desideratum, ’’which is the exclusion of foreign air services on the Kabul- Dakka line or a similar line eastward from I! Kandahar/— ■v Kandai'iar”, appreciate that it constitutes an advance and that nothing more could have been hoped for. The Government of India raise the question of the exact meaning of the second undertaking - X1Z.* » ttat' if a convention is signed between the Afghans and the Russians for a joint Russo-Afghan air service, a convention on the same conditions will be granted to His Majesty’s Government, should they so desire - and suggest that it has reference to the grant to the Russians of the concession of establishing a service to KaJaui and no ^» Basawal. Their construction is no doubt correct, though we may await Mr. Maconachie’s confirnation. But the report of the conversations with the Prime Minister (paragraph 30 of enclosure 1 B to Kabul despatch 63 of 9th September) — P-fa and the subsequent correspondence between Mr. Maconachie and the Afghan Foreign Minister (enclosures 2 G and 2 E on pages 12 and 13 of the same despatch) refer to the grant to British machines of 'a similar concession”, ”if any concession were given to Russian machines in future to fly flYST aflY Pfrrt »&amp;£ Af^ian territory ” . Probably the difficulty is more apparent than real: but we nay await the Minister’s comments. ^ The Government of India remain, as in last July, reluctant for political and financial reasons to commit themselves to expenditure on air communications with Afghanistan. It will be remembered that they then indicated that they would prefer that ”for a limited period no action should be taken by any party to develop air communications !he kt lii Ic sh co fi al o: a from Kabul eastwards” although, if this was impracticable and a priority of option could be secured instead, they,* agreed to the grant of authority to the Minister to negotiate on the basis of a twice-weekly service between Rawalpindi and Kabul( ^ fU-Ffw *) . The/Department. The estimates prepared in 1928 of the cost of such a service will be found on P. 4607/28, flagged at the bottom of the file. r The Government of India urge that the Minister should continue to aim at the avoidance of any financial commitments and generally at delaying a decision by the Afghans in matters of air policy as long as possible, but with a view to being prepared, should this prove impracticable, and to reducing their commitments in that event to the lowest possible figure, the 1928 estimates are being re-examined and an alternative scheme on the basis of a service once a week instead of twice a week and operated with single- or twin-engined machines instead of three-engined nachines, is under investigation. Secretary. S. &amp; 0. J)jmt., For information and any observations# In this connection, we have not yet had the Government of India’s comments on the proposal in paragraph 6 of the Air Ministry letter of last November. The present correspondence makes it clear, I think, that while they will respond willingly to any indication of an Afghan desire for a Kabul-India air service, they would definitely prefer to do nothing until they have to. —■ C(. urnrii AiK imiJL.

Sir, Dated ITew Delhi, the /// February 1931. I am directed to invite a reference to the correspondence ending with Despatch Ko* 63, dated the 9th September 1930, from His Majesty's Minister at Kabul to His Majesty's Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, regarding the establishment of a civil air service between India and Afghanistan^ Advantage has been taken of the visit of His Majesty's Minister to Delhi to discuss this question with him, and the Government of India, consider that it may be useful at this stage to review the position and to indicate their views. 2.* As a result of the skilful handling of this question by Mr* Maconachie in his interview with the Afghan Prime Minister, we have secured from the Afghan Government the double undertaking that (a) if the agreement now under negotiation between the Afghan Government and the Junkers Company for an air service between Herat - Kandahar - Ghazni - Kabul and Basaval is concluded, the Afghan Government will not request permission for aeroplanes of the Junker Company tq fly over Indian soil; and (b) that if a convention is signed between the Government of King Hadir Shah and the U.S.S.R. for a joint Russian and Afghan air service, a Convention on the same conditions will be granted to His Majesty*s Government, shouldshould that Government so desire* 3* The first undertaking it is true falls short of attaining 0113 : main present desideratum, which is the exclusion of foreign air services on the Kabul - Dakka line or a similar line eastwards from Kandahar. To have secured it however constitutes a distinct advance, and the Government of India fully appreciate that in face of His Highness Muhammad Hashim Khan t s explanation of the Afghan Governments position in the matter it was out of the question to ask for more at the time. The f second undertaking is of course of great potential value. The language of the Afghan Foreign Minister's letter \dzvtt TKk: * . . ^ . ..x. dated the 4th September on this point is not free from ambiguity, but if it is read with the language held by Jb of, V T I*&gt;' ,u 7 f -&lt; the Prime Minister in the interview of 25rd August and that of His Majesty's Minister's letter Ho. 571 of 2nd September 1950 to the Afghan Foreign Minister, the meaning appears to be that if the Russians are given the concession of establishing a service to Kabul His Majesty's Government will be given an opportunity of securing a similar concession. The Government of India understand that there is no question of a Russian service other ^ to Kabul? if such a service were proposed e.g. to Basawal, the granting of a -similar concession- would seem to be meaningless* 4* I am to add that for the political and financial reasons stated in the telegram from the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department Ho. 2564-S of the 22nd July, the force of which has not decreased since that date, the Government of India trust that His Majesty's Minister will continue to aim at avoidance of any financial commitments in this respect and generally ^n-ision bv the Afghan Government in at delaying a decision oy matters of air policy as long as possible. /l5* Meanwhile with a view to reducing the commitment, should it become unavoidable, to the lowest possible figure, they are scrutinising afresh the previous estimates ( vide papers forwarded with my letter Ho* 63-M, dated the 9th August 1928) and working out an alternative scheme on the basis of a service once a week instead of twice a week and operated with single or twin-engined, instead of three-engined machines* The extent to which expenditure might be still further reduced by establishing the proposed Indo-Afghan service as part of a possible future extension of the existing Karachi - Delhi service is also being examined* 6* A copy of this letter is being sent to His Majesty's Minister, Kabul, for his information and for any comments he may wish to make* Offg* Foreign Secretary to the Government of India I have the honour to be.

We have now received from the Charge d f Affaires at Tehran the report called for by the Foreign Office as regards the possible extension of the JunTers air service to Afghanistan. The effect of this is to show that there seems to be every prosaect of Kabul being linked up by air with Persia m the near future. On the assumption that this is correct, there seems extremely little chance of a request being made to us for a British-controlled service between Peshawar and Kabul. The case for action on the lines suggested by the Air Ministry m their lettei of 6th November was possibly never very strong, and the latest developments seem to weaken it still further. I have discussed the matter by telephone with Group Captain Pierce of the Air j inistry, and •understand that they would probably be prepared to let the matter drop.

Department. 41933 5000 10/30 Sir, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to say that action on the Air Ministry letter of 6th November', No. S.26391/S.6, has been deferred pending further enquiry as to the progress of negotiations between i the Afghan Government and Junkers for an extension to Kabul of their service to Tehran. From Tehran despatch No. 13 of 12th January, 1931 of which copies were sent to the Air Ministry 'under Foreign Office letter of 13th January, No. H 577/577/97, it would appear that there is now every prospect of Kabul being linked up by air with Persia in the near future, and of the conclusion of an air agreement between the Afghan Government and Junkers. In the light of this information, the Secretary of State is inclined to doubt whether any useful purpose would be served by instructions to Mr. Maconachie on the lines suggested in Air Ministry letter of 6th November, referred to above, and, subject to the concurrence of the Air Council, he would suggest that the matter might be/ villy (»r.h« C0»B»MC.tk». on .hi, ,ub,«C, plea,0 quo,e &lt;^ y no. siij97- and address —not to any person bf name, but t^- lThe Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.V INDlAjDIBEGT i*o (pA-frk •v rn: the Under-Seoretary of Staffi-^ftTf^OTCi^n Affairs presents his compliments to ^ LC^Ma, Icl^ASoJ^, and, by direction of the Secretary of State, transmits herewith oopCt^ of the under-mentioned paper. /' ■ - 1 { ( V Foreign Office, , I ottff, 3&lt;S Reference to previous correspondence : Description oj Enclosure. 1 Name and Date.

The latter’s action, as reported by Herr Weil, makes it clear that they have themselves no notion of what their own suggestion meant, and having now been asked by this Legation for 16 Right Honourable Arthur Henderson, M.P., The Foreign Office. furtherfurther particulars, attempted to pick the brains of the Director of Junkers. I find it hard to believe that ignorant though the Persian Government are in business matters they can ever have imagined that Junkers would consent to run two parallel routes across northern and central Persia, though there can be little doubt that they would welcome any excuse for refusing to extend the Imperial Airways concession either for the present route or a new one. 3 . I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, His Majesty’s High Commissioner for ’Iraq and to His Majesty’s Minister at Kabul. I have, etc., (Signed) R.C.Parr.34J) COPY. On January 4th Mr•Weil, Manager of Junkers Company Limited in Persia, called on me by appointment. He stated that the Junkers Company had re-commenced negotiations with the present Afghan Government, for an air line in Afghanistan, on the basis of the agreement which had been concluded with ex-King Amanulla. As the present negotiations progressed the following more important modifications were introduced:- (i) Originally four Junker aircraft were to be supplied by the Afghan Government and four by the Company, and an equal number of German and Afghan pilots were to be employed* This was thought to be impracticable and unsatisfactory* In consequence it is now proposed that Junkers Company should own and maintain the necessary aircraft, the pilots should be German and the line entii^ly controlled by the Company, with the stipulation that the capital required for the organisation and the working of the line, within Afghan limits, should be subscribed in equal shares by the Afghan Government and Junkers Ltd. (ii) In the original contract the Company was to receive a subsidy from the Afghan Government. Junkers do not like this arrangement and prefer to receive a guaiant-e. It is considered that a subsidy limits enterprise but with a guarantee both parties endeavour to produce results above the terms of the guarantee. (iii) Under the terms of the previous contract Junkers Company were to instal in Kabul workshops for complete overhauls and guaranteed repairs of all Afghan «ir Pore., machines. This it is hoped to modify as the Company do not wish to have any dealings with the Afghan Air Fore- but wish to limit work in their workshops to Junkers civil aircraft only. A(ii) \J A new Afghan Ambassador is shortly arriving in Tehran and Mr .Weil has sent a telegram to tha Afghan Government requesting that this Ambassador may be granted powers to discuss with him and if necessary finally sign an agreement for an Afghan air line. Mr .Weil had previously told me that an extension of the Persian line to Kabul was not at present contemplated, he now explained that he himself thought that no extension should be considered until the financial situation improved but he had since learned that his directors considered that this was a particularly favourable opportunity to inaugurate an extension into Afghanistan. Mr. Weil is of opinion, from information at his disposal, that the Afghans generally will enjoy and employ air travel and an air line in Afghanistan will produce profitable results. Before a final agreement with the Afghan Government is reached the Company hope to get permission for a temporary fortnightly trial service between Tehran and Kabul via Meshed, Herat and Kandahar. Mr.Weil has promised to keep me informed regarding further negotiations with the Afghan Government. In addition to the above, Mr. Weil mentioned the following matters (i) The Luft Hansa line could, with the concurrence Turkish authorities, maintain connnunication between Berlin and Baghdad in two days. The Junkers Company could extend this service via Meshed to the ^andahar - Chaman Quetta , tn the Khvber-Peshawar frontier frontier in two more days and at +v*/-»iiefVi the Junkers Company were rivals in another day. Although the ouiu 4 . latter were using 60% to the Luft Hansa concern yet the latter Junker aircraft.(ii) On January 4th Mr. Weil was asked by the Persian Government if he could establish a central route across Persia. On enquiring exactly what was meant by a central route and which places it would be necessary to connect, he was informed that this had not yet been decided. As Junkers Company already link Baghdad with Meshed and Bushne with Pahlevi, Mr. Weil considered that perhaps this question of a central route was casually mentioned to him as it had some bearing on the agreement between Imperial Airways and the Persian Government. (iii) Junkers Company hope eventually to establish a line to the far East via Baghdad, Tehran, Kabul, and N. India etc. It is hoped to organise and locate this line so that it will not directly compete with Imperial Airways but will cover an area to the North of that traversed by the latter air line. In this service it will be necessary to fly over mountains as much as 17,000 feet high and Junkers Company have carried out experiments in high altitude flying for this purpose.

Reference to previous correspondence : Similar letter sent to^ H— 21388 B ( 2 )Since the Air Ministry letter of 6th November on P. 7807/30 belo?/ was written, a statement has appeared in the Press that the Junkers Company have reached an agreement w ith the Afghan Government for the establishment of an air service, to begin next spring, between Meshed (which is itself in communication by means of a Junkers service with Tehran) and Herat, Kandahar and Kabul. Mr. Maconachie f s telegraphic report of his discussion with the Afghans on air questions has also been supplemented by the full report contained in his despatch, No. 63, of 0th September, 1030, which a copy is attached. The conversations between Mr. Maccnachie and the Prime Minister (paragraphs 17-30 on pages r; and 8 of Kabul despatch, 63, of 9th September) go to make it clear that the Afghan i deal is that no foreigners at all should fly in would adopt in the event of the Junkers negotiation falling Afghanistan (compare paragraph 30), and that they were in any case anxious not to commit themselves as to what course theya service. i However small the chances of any Afghan demarcne , there is no reason of principle why hr. Maconachie should not be at liberty, in the event of one being nade, to receive it in a sympathetic manner. I am inclined uo doubt if it is really necessary to go beyond this: nor could the Afghans themselves reasonably expect immediate acceptance by us of such a proposal if they were to make it. Some discussion both with the Government of India and with His Majesty’s Government would probably be inevitablev though- it would no doubt be possible to keep it within as narrow limits and to deal with it as expeditiously as possible. It is clear from what is stated in the preceding paragraph that little delay need be expected (unless circumstances change) in securing authority for the offer of a service on the lines now proposed by the Air Ministry. (It may be remarked in this connection, with reference to paragraph 5 of the Air ^Ministry letter, that Mr. Maconachie ! s inability in May 1930 to take an Afghan hint that the Afghan Government might be prepared to consider a Kabul-India air service was not so much due to the absence of adequate authority as to the fact that His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India were still at that stage entirely undecided as to the practicability of such a service, consistently with our anxiety to keep the frontier closed to aircraft of foreign nations.) . . .

I have reported these conversations, of which I took notes at the time, at considerable length, since they afford some indication of the attitude of King Nadir Shah’s Government in regard to several questions of permanent importance. 3. The passages enclosed in brackets in the a^de memoire drafted by me for the Prime Minister (Enclosure 2-B) are those which are omitted or substantially altered in the Foreign Minister’s reply (Enclosure 2-D) ; and so require brief notice. The omission of paragraph 1 of the draft aide memoire is explained in the notes of the conversations. As my instructions only required me to make clear the attitude of His Majesty’s Government in regard to the points mentioned in this paragraph, I saw no objection, once this had been done, to meeting the wishes of the Afghan Government in regard to it. King Nadir Shah’s proposal for the settle ment of frontier questions by the Prime Minister and myself dropped out with the mention of the particular questions in connection with which it was made, and wou/d in any case probably be opposed by the Afghan Foreign Office. The omission of the passages marked in paragraphs 2 and 3 of the draft aide memoire is no doubt due to a desire to avoid definite commitments in regard to matters which are still in the future and circumstances which are still uncertain ; while it is characteristic of Afghan sensitiveness to decline to admit in writing the humiliating facts that the present Russian air service is covered by no agreement, but continues to operate in Afghan territory in spite of this irregularity. The expression “ Russian and Afghan Aeroplanes ” in paragraph 3 of the Foreign Minister’s reply (Enclosure 2-D), is to be read with the Prime Minister’s account of the negotiations pending with Junkers (Enclosure 1-B), and points to the intention of the Afghan Government to grant no concession in future for air services within their territory which would exclude participation, at any rate on paper, by themselves. 4 A copy of this despatch is being forwarded to the Secretary of State for India and to the Government of India.

I King Nadir Shah received me alone, and, after the conventional expenditure of time on unimportant topics, I said that with reference to the Foreign Minister s application for assistance in the form of arms and money from His Majesty s Government, I had been directed, while stating that my Government accepted this request in principle, to say that they would be glad to receive nformation as to the objects for which the arms and money were required, a,nd generally an indication of the future policy of the Afghan Government. Wml? they were not attaching any conditions to their offer, they expected that it would be acknow ledged by King Nadir Shah in the form of careful atte ntion to what I had to say as regards their attitude and wishes.

T promised that there was no question of a recurrent subsidy, and understood that no such subsidy was desired, or would be accepted, by His Majesty, if it were offered. e He confirmed this emphatically. T went on to explain that assistance was offered on this special occasion, in view of the Special emergency which had arisen owing to the late revolution in Afghanistan. 5T He said that he quite understood this. , T pointed out that, although the Foreign Minister had suggested that His Maiestv’s Government had plenty of money and arms to give away, this was not the case In England there was financial stringency, unemployment, and heavy taxation. In^India revenue had fallen heavily owing to the present civil dis- obedience campaign. 7 He remarked that he was quite aware of this. S I said that nevertheless His Majesty’s Government were able to offer substan tial assistance which they considered to be sufficient, if not to meet every reqmre- ment^f 8 Afghanistan, a/any rate, to give the Afghan Government a very usehi start in making their own way, and I hoped that His Majesty would admit that their attitude was a generous one. ^ T1 . , q I also had to explain that their offer was not intended to buy Afghan rien - shin in competition with another power. It was an expression of good will, but md friendship could only be brought about by mutual confidence founded on experience of mutual good faith and observance of Treaty obligations I pressed this point because the Foreign Minister’s remarks to me had suggested that he« under a misapprehension in regard to it.* _ . ,,, 1.1 |o His Majesty said he was very sorry that his Foreign Minister had taken tte line which he had with me, and he hi hi Foreign Minister had had no authority whatever from either himself or his broker the Prime Minister, to take this line. He had been “hungry for assistance, and it was only the strength of his feelings which had led him astray. &gt;' I went on to remind His Majesty that my ^vernment had been m mg o help Amanullah Khan, provided that they could be ^^^wTnbsta given would be employed for a really useful purpose They had off e re4 tial assistance towards the improvement of the KabuhLandi Khan • ^ ullah Khan had demanded cash and a free hand m its expendit , P P had consequently fallen through. The attitude of my (^venimM codd^ regarded ai unreasonable, since Mahmud Tam had « Wd ® “ Humphrys that if he filled the Chardeh plain with gold and gave ttot th ^ Government for expenditure on the road, none of it would eve p^ purpose. Consequently my Government would he g a P , from His Majesty that the money which they now offered would not be spent, as money had been spent by Amamillah Khan, on (1) luxuries such as Dar-ul-Aman, cinemas, etc., nor (2) on objects which were prejudicial to British interests e.g., tenance of relations with our frontier tribes wine ^ to the spirit of the Treaty and ordinary mternational pract^ maintenance of these relations had been effec 7 Grovern- which were particularly objectionable to His i aje y ment— (a) The invitation of our tribesmen to jirgas by Afghan officia s. ^ (b) The payment of allowances by the Afghan Government to men ' , , i |j ne as (c) The employment of onr tribesmen on the Indian side 0 P- Afghan Khassadars. ^ ug nl M This policy had been initiated by Nasrulla Khan and {or intention aiM effect. During Amanullah’s time we had had c ^erlying complaint, and, although towards the end of his reign the m beeI1 0 bjec- his frontier policy seemed to have been less hostile, its effect ia tionable from tbe British point of vie\w * Kabul despatch No. 52, dated August 15th, 1930.13 £- no . ^[adir Sliah’s policy during the last few months had been consistently friendly, and His Majesty’s Government fully appreciated this fact. At the same time in Waziristan, his grant of honorary rank to persons, who had subsequently, and largely by virtue of that rank, taken a leading part in fomenting disturbances, gave my Government just cause for complaint. His Majesty said that he entirely agreed with what I had said about Afghan frontier policy in the past. The only point on which I seemed to require an answer from him was that regarding the honorary ranks recently granted to certain tribes men I knew, he said, why these had been given ; for the simple reason that, at the time there had been nothing else to give. A Divisional General who had no division was clearly ludicrous and, he would have thought, would consequently carry little weight with his fellow-tribesmen. However he acccepted what 1 had said as the fack and would assure me that his frontier policy was, and would be, entirely directed towards the maintenance of peace on both sides of the frontier and the avoidance of anything to which His Majesty’s Government could reasonably object. ^ The objects on which expenditure by the Afghan Government was urgently required were— (1) Reorganization of the Army, including the formation of irregular bodies of Afghan tribesmen to be called up in time of special emergency as for the Koh-i-daman rising ; “ but not ”, he added with a smile, “ in similar numbers (21 The improvement of communications, particularly with India, by road ; and eventually, though he realised that this was a question for the future, not the present, railways. (3) Frontier expenditure. /(, It was the last which might arouse suspicion on the part of His Majesty’s Gov ernment, but he assured me that such expenditure would kv“^°7 t L P t Twould to British Interests, and in order to satisfy me on the point he hoped that it w he possible for the Prime Minister and myself to sit as a ^ rt ° f ®° m t ™ S ' sion to deal with all frontier questions between the two Governments as they arose The P^e Minister would show me the Afghan frontier Budget and would be ready to explain the object of any item regarding which I reqmred info ation. Expenditure on luxuries in any form was out of the question tor the Afghan Government, for at least six or seven years. 17 I said that, as regards arms, my .^^“^freXe the^neSy o7an His Majesty’s military experience an , ^ wo uld be glad of an assurance efficient, well-paid, and contented army , but they woma oe g ^ ^ ^ ^ that the arms which they offered would go m o e A ii|’ tj me the source of strength to the CentralGovernrnent. * army had collapsed, not through lack of arms, but through negiecr starvation. -i r -i • . ...p- ^ HisMajesty replied that it was hardly necessary, he opji^mr im me that he fully realised the necessity of an efficient stan ? q In reply to a convehtional apolo^^&lt;m my^pa^he^aidHiat^e least resent the suggestions I had made a J v ice which he entirely agreed of the goodwill of my Government in o Khan ’ s time the army had was m the best interest of Afghanistan. , which was usutelly badly m received a net pay of three or four rupees a and CO nseauently arrears.

Who were these enemies ? First and most important of all were the Bolshevik propagandists. Afghanistan’s first interest was to prevent the penetration of this propaganda into her own limits, and His Majesty’s Govern ment would, on behalf of India, have good reason to complain if Afghanistan failed in this duty. He himself was taking strong action in this respect, and cited the execution of Abdur Rahman.* “ I have also dealt with others ”, he added. He went on to say that I was probably aware of his insistence on the strict observance of Islamic law and practice, and of his efforts to conciliate the mullahs. His real motive in this was to raise a strong bulwark, such as could best be provided by religious orthodoxy, against the spread of Bolshevism. Z4 Secondly, Amanullah Khan, whom he would not hesitate to describe, in con versation with me, as an enemy both of himself and of the true interest of Afghan istan. There was one method by which Amanullah Khan might recover his lost throne, and that was by putting himself at the head of the frontier tribes as a leader of a Holy War against India. If he did this King Nadir Shah did not feel that he himself could oppose him successfully. In Afghanistan a king who tried to restrain the tribes at a time like the present, and maintained a friendly attitude towmrds India, had no chance against a ‘ ghazi ’. Fortunately however Amanul lah Khan was not a man to risk his life in a gamble of this kind, and would in all probability let the opportunity slip. He hoped that once the present trouble was over, he could consolidate his own position and that the opportunity would never occur. 2 Z Thirdly, the Khilafatist leaders in India, who were as bitterly opposed to him self as they were to His Majesty’s Government. When he had met me in Parachinar, he had asked me if it would not be possible for the Government of India to take action against Zafar Ali, editor of the “ Zamin- dar ”, who was always attacking him. Eventually Zafar Ali had been imprison ed for two years on account of his hostility to the Government of India. ^ These instances showed that his own enemies were also the enemies of His Majesty’s Government, and the fact went to prove his sincerity when he assured me that his policy was directed towards the maintenance of friendly relations with His Majesty’s Government. . Z^I said that the latter had already acknowledged his friendly attitude in regard to frontier affairs during the recent disturbances. They wmre particularly sensible of what he had done in regard to the Chaknaur mullah, but the Government of India were rather concerned at the fact that this mullah had been allowed to return to his home, just at the time when an Afridi lashkar had reached the Peshawar District, and the Afridis were making every effort to induce the Mohmands to join them. Z(o His Majesty thought for a moment before replying that he quite realised the possible danger of the Mohmands moving. He did not however think that the Afghan Mohmands would join. He had brought Muhasil up to Kabul and sent him on to the Koh-i-daman to interview Muhammad Gul, who, as a fellow Moh- mand, had great influence with him. His Majesty himself had impressed on both Muhasil and the Chaknaur mullah that there was no justification for a Holy War against India, that the agitation for it was merely trickery on the part of discon tented Hindus, and that disturbances on either side of the frontier were contrary to the true interests of Afghanistan. T 7 There was another subject, I said, on which my Government would be glad of information and that was as regards air services in Afghanistan. Afghan istan was of course entirely free to allow such air services as she pleased o\er her c)wn territory. But, at the same time, while there was an air service to Russia and another about to be started to Persia, there seemed to be an attitude of suspicion on the part of the Afghan Government in regard to air connections between Afghanistan and India, the third contiguous country. So, in the past, * Kabul telegram No. 89, dated July 28th, 1930. jsk, jKoKf.-M time if k tort and snlkennnent 'ilWtktiD iMoadittiia «. it would] ‘ii ii Maori GiflOO, tilth pur] Mltkewa Vkotli ^tesnetb the con %n Go Ifkno o the Air (kencY m hninedii given t] * , frontier i^outtb ^itoit]when it had been a matter of absolute necessity, viz., for the evacuation of foreign personnel, for British machines to visit Kabul, these operations had been made the subject of a formal and emphatic objection by the Afghan Legation in London. Such an attitude would hardly appear to be consonant with King Nadir Shah’s declaration of friendliness, of the sincerity of which he had already given proofs. 1% His Majesty replied that this was a matter on which he would have to consult the Prime Minister, and would then give me a satisfactory reply. I then specified the offers of His Majesty’s Government as follows :— / (1) Rifles. —10,000 with 5,000,000 rounds S. A. A. ; both of the same type as was now in use in the Indian Army and guaranteed absolutely serviceable ; delivery to be begun at the first favourable opportunity. 7*&gt; Some discussion of details followed, in the course of which I took the oppor tunity of calling the King’s attention to the ill-treatment of Indian lorry drivers by his officials. (2) Money. —£100,000 down, with a further substantial sum in four months’ time if relations between the two Governments remained satisfac tory and as at present. 1/ For political reasons it would be convenient that this sum should be given as a loan free of interest. 3 v His Majesty asked if the rifles would also be a loan, j ? I said that they would not; these would be given outright, iv He asked whether any term had been fixed for repayment, and when His Majesty’s Government would demand repayment. $r.i replied that it was proposed to leave the matter of repayment open, and I personally thought that, if relations between the two Governments continued to be satisfactory, it would probably not be pressed. Payment could be made in silver coin either in India or at Kabul against credits in India. U Out of this £100,000, five lakhs of rupees could be supplied immediately, if necessary, for the purpose of liquidating the Koh-i-daman business. Tf He said that this five lakhs would not be required, as the Koh-i-daman trouble was over and there was no immediate need of money to pay the tribal levies. With regard to the question of a loan, he wished to consult the Prime Minister i who would resume the conversation with me r King Nadir Shah asked me to convey an expression of his deep gratitude both to His Majesty’s Government and to the Government of India, and said that he would like, as the converse of my remarks, to state his hopes in regard to the policy of His Majesty’s Government:— (1) That no opportunity would be lost of inflicting a crushing defeat on the Afridis now in the Peshawar District, Clemency might be advisable in the subsequent settlement, but the/ immediate need was a severe lesson to the Afridis. t is given the result would be a return to peaceful conditions along the frontier on both the Indian and the Afghan sides. I pointed out that only recently his Foreign Minister had pleaded for leniency in the treatment of the Waziristan tribes, who had made an unprovo e a ac ' on our posts. 4( His Majesty said that the Wazirs were different. Tljey were subject to bfs of excitement but were really not hostile to us and, he fejt sui e, wo u soon _ down contentedly. This was not the case with the Afridis, would^ad leal windy in the head ’, and needed a severe lesson. (2) That the relations of His Majesty’s Government with Egypt would be put on a really friendly footing as soon as possi e. The more sympathetic the attitude of His Majesty’s Government was toward Moslem States in general, and at the present moment, Egypt in particular, the 1 jStC549FI)embarrassing would it be for himself to be regarded, as he was at present ii Afghanistan, as a friend of Great Britain, Enclosure No. 1 (B) to His Majesty’s Minister, Kabul’s despatch No. 63, dated 9th September 1930. B. Note of an interview with His Highness Muhammad Hashim Khan, Prime Minister, on August 23rd, 1930. I I said that I had understood from the King that the Prime Minister would wish to discuss with me further the question of the loan offered by my Government, and would give a satisfactory answer to my enquiry regarding Afghan air policy. 1 Muhammad Hashim replied that he would first like to hear everything I had said to King Nadir Shah, remarking—“ He of course is a King, but still I am Prime Minister ”. 3 I had notes of this conversation with me, and ran through them with him. H Some time was taken over the attitude of His Majesty’s Government regard ing Afghan frontier activities. I developed the point that even if the hostile in tention underlying interference with our tribes was a thing of the past, the effects survived the original intention, and cited the instances of Saiyyid Almar and Saiyyid Kabir, and the use recently made of the standards given to the Afridis by King Nadir Shah and Muhammad Hashim Khan himself at Hadda in 1920, as well as the honorary ranks recently conferred on Wazir hostiles. I said however that I had no authority to make any definite demands at the present juncture. ST He remarked that it was at such times as these when we had difficulties on the frontier, that the question should be discussed and cleared up. b I replied it was not our difficulties which my Government had in mind, but those of Afghanistan. They did not wish to embarrass Afghanistan in the midst of these difficulties, I was directed however to make it clear that the attitude of my Government on this subject was fixed, and sooner or later the whole question would have to be discussed. At present it was a real obstacle in the way of closer relations between the two Governments. . Muhammad Hashim said that he was willing to discuss it, but he would re mind me that Afghanistan could not afford to quarrel with our frontier tribes. It was to these tribes that King Nadir Shah largely owed his recent success. They had saved him in fact from ruin. ? I said that this attitude was quite understood, and it was our tribes which had also helped Afghanistan in 1919. The whole question was difficult, and would be better reserved for future discussion. At present I was only authorised to make the attitude of my Government in regard to it clear. *1 With regard to the loan he asked the same questions as King Nadir Shah, and I gave the same replies. 1^ He added however that the King had understood that the five lakhs, which I had offered for immediate necessities, was additional to the £100,000. H I said that this was not so, and in any case His Majesty had said that it was not required. t ^ He asked if payment could be made in London, and I expressed regret that it could not. He remarked that he thought it would be awkward getting so nine money up to Kabul ; but I said that I did not see any difficulty in doing so, i i were drawn by drafts in instalments as required. With regard to the munitions he said the King had understood that 1,000 rounds per rifle would be supplied. I corrected this impression. He pointed out that 1,000 rounds was the ordinary scale per rifle in Afghanis tan, and that the Afghan Government were very short of ammunition. I struck to the 500 rounds, and suggested that he should not look a gift hoise, in the mouth. •'1'S teij.; iwuglileiil' sty's OdVilE; i we tail it®’ :dup. Aipl it tik cuss it) iljjouifmfet*, liiwiitffi® 17 With regard to air services I took the sane line as I had with the Kin'?, asking merely for information regarding the policy of the present Afghan Government. IX Muhammad Hashim sa d he would give me full infoumatio i, and speaking with apparent frankness, said that the agreement with Kussia for an air service between £ tbul and the Russian border had been for two years, and this period had now ex pired The Afghan Government did not like this service ; Russian machines came and went irregularly, and entirely as they pleased ; sometimes there were no arrivals or departures for weeks together and at other times two machines would arrive at Kabul within a few days. The Russians always made technical excuses for not meeting Afghan wishes in regard to the operation of the service, and would never carry passengers or messages, when this was urgently required by the Afghan Government, to such places as Kandahar, Herat, etc. The Afghan Government bad consequently, in Amanullah Khan’s time, decided to make an agreement with Junkers. This agreement had not yet been actually signed. Taumann* ought to have returned to Kabul three weeks after his departure, but nothing had yet been beard of him. The terms were still under consideration. For instance Junkers in tbeir draft contract had stipulated for tl e cessation of the present Russian service but the Afghan Government, although they had no wish to continue the Russian service, declined to be dictated to in such a m vtter by Junkers, and had struck out this clause. This was one of the points still under dispute. ja On the other hand when M. Stark had pressed him to renc w the Russian agree ment Muhammad Hashim had refused, saying that the matter must await the con clusion of negotiations with Junkers. M. Stark had thereupon protested that the Prime Minister never met his wishes on any point and was an Anglophil, while the Junkers service would be really a British concern in disguise. It* Mulnmnad Hashim had replied that, whatever his personal feelings might bej as Prime Minister of Afghanistan he was merely out for the good of his country, and entirely impartial in his attitude towards all foreign Governments. He had nwer heard of any British participation in Junkers, but while at Moscow had come to know of Russian association with this fr m and had in fact visited the headquarters of a joint Russian and Junkers concern. The policy of the Afghan Government, His Highness went on, was to enter into a true partnership with Junkers ; either partner supplying two machines for the operation of a purely internal air service in Afghanistan to carry passengers and mails between Herat, Kandahar, Ghazni, Kabul and B asaw al. Basawal had been chosen because it would be easier to make a landing ground there than at Dakka. In carrying out this policy the Afghan Government were entirely within their rights, ard were not infringing those of any foreign Power. I thanked him for this interesting information, and with his permission offered one or two remarks. He had made the Afghan attitude in the matter quite clear, hut I asked him to look at the question for a moment from the British point of view. My Government would not, I thought, agree to machines of a third Power crossing tbe Indian frontier from Afghanistan ; at any rate so long as their own machines were excluded from Afghan limits. For one thing, if such permission were given hy my Govermnent, British prestige among our frontier tribes would certainly suffer; while they would also think that the exclusion of British machines from Afghanistan coupled with the admission of foreign machines from Afghanistan, showed that Anglo-Afghan friendship was more apparent than real. This would be undesirable from both the British and the Afghan point of view. His Highness said that he quite understood my argument, and declared that the Afghan Government would never expect or ask permission for the gian Junkers machines to cross the Indian frontier. The service would be entirely internal to Afghanistan. 1 I remarked that Junkers would certainly wish to connect such a service with the one they were already operating in Persia. '' Muhammad Hashim replied that this might be so, but the Afghan Government ^ere not interested in such a project. ■' I went cm tr&gt; oott aHVw-mrrh T hfl.cl no snecial knowledge, I felt convinced that J *' 8 I 1.through Kabul both eastward and westward. The Afghan Government of the time might wish, entirely in their own interests, that such projects should be carried out, but, if they had tied themselves up with Junkers, and the latter’s machines were not admitted to India, there would be a gap left on the through air route which would have to be very inconveniently traversed by road. r*] He took note of this point and said he had not thought of it, but would bring it to the notice of the Council of Ministers. 'Uf I said that as he already knew of the Russian interest in one of Junkers’ bran ches there was no need for me to say much on this point. He might however be interested to hear that, when a director of Junkers had approached Sir F. Humphrys for permission for the Afghan-Junkers machines to cross the Indian frontier, the source of this proposal had been admitted to be Russian.* I asked what the intentions of the Afghan Government were if the Junkers contract fell through. Would the present irregular Russian service continue or not? T-o Muhammad Hashim replied that, as I probably realised, he himself would prefer that no foreigners at all should fly in Afghanistan. The ideal would be a purely Afghan service with Afghan machines and Afghan pilots, but this was im possible. Amanullah Khan had committed his Government to the Russian service, and the only practicable way of getting out of this commitment seemed to be a contract with Junkers. If that contract fell through he did not know what would happen, but could state that if any concession were given to Russian ma chines in future to fly over any part of Afghan territory, a similar concession would be granted to British machines. -1 I S aid that my discussions both with the King and himself had been long and on subjects of considerable importance, and I therefore proposed that I should exchange aide memoires with him summarising the gist of our conversations. iX His Highness replied that between gentlemen oral statements were as good as. itost details iiigi 31st t 1 rbme tjounc :|i explained asm question tt flat the p ifi doubts a sfjliisGove] im but ] ’iiteetk written ones. 33 I agreed, but pointed out that oral conversations were liable to misapprehen sion and to subsequent incorrect recollection. For instance, although I had spoken to the King very carefully from written notes, I had yet given him the impression that the five lakhs were additional to the £100,000 and that 1,000 rounds would be supplied with each rifle. This showed how necessary it was for either side to give a brief summary in writing of their statements. 34 The Prime Minister agreed with some demur, and asked me to send him draft aide memoires summarising the offer of assistance made by His Majesty’s Govern ment, and the statements regarding Afghan policy made in conversation by the Ring and himself.

[ On August 28th Sardar Faiz Muhammad opened the subject of the aide memoire, which I had drafted for signature by the Prime Minister. The difficultv was ^ said, in regard to the first paragraph. The Afghan Government could not P 08 ^^ promise to stop all allowances paid to tribes on our side of the li ne - ^ uc a ,, i. ances had been paid in the time of Abdur Rahman, Plabibullah, aR d Ani ana ^ without any protest from us. Even a strong Government like that of India a pay allowances to frontier tribes, and after all, as at present, had occasiona r0 , with them. Afghanistan could not face the hostility which would ar0 con . against her on the frontier, if she suddenly stopped payments which had een sistently made hitherto. So far she had not paid any such allowances, as s e ^ been able to plead with perfect truth that she had no mone/, but, with ie r ^ ege of settled conditions and the increase of revenue she would have to resume payments. Another point was that the Afghan Government proposed^enp^ * Kabul telegram No. 171, dated 15th November 1928.u tribesmen, including some from the Indian side of the line, in their military forces inside Afghanistan, and did not see why they should not do so. t I replied that His Excellency had completely misunderstood my draft as he would realise if he would be good enough to read it again more carefully. I was not asking the Afghan Government to promise anything at all at the moment as regards frontier matters, but simply to say that they had taken note of the attitude of my Government. These frontier questions were difficult, and would require detailed discussion. My Government did not wish to press such discussions on the Afghan Government at the present time, or to seem to take advantage of their difficulties. As regards the employment of tribesmen, he would see from my draft that the particular practice under objection was the employment of our tribesmen on the Indian side of the line. *3 Faiz Muhammad replied that he did not think there had ever been such a practice, and he could not understand its object. u I said that I could assure him that it has been the practice in the time of Amanullah Khan, and could quite easily tell him its object, but had no wish to go into unpleasant details at the moment. ' On August 31st the Foreign Minister called at the Legation and went over much the same ground again. 4 I again explained that I was not asking for any promises to be made, until the points in question had been threshed out in discussion. ■? He said that the position which I suggested was one in which my Government was left with doubts as to the sincerity of the intentions of the Afghan Government, and was accordingly unpalatable to the latter, who would be only too pleased to do anything they could to remove such doubts. As regards invitations of tribes men to jirgas his Government were ready to promise that they would not so summon ou tribesmen, but would have to explain that if these tribesmen came at their own instance they could not, in defiance of all Pathan custom, be driven away without being shown any consideration and paid the ordinary expenses. ^ In regard to Khassadars they wished to state quite frankly that they intended to employ tribesmen, some of whom might be ours, in their military forces inside Afghanistan. Occasionally such tribesmen would go on leave, and then they would be on the Indian side of the line, while in the service of the Afghan Government. As regards allowances they simply could not, for the reasons already explained , agree to discontinue these and therefore it was no use discussing the point , the Afghan Government in fact declined to d.scuss this subject at all. His Excellency hoped that I would forgive his bluntness, but his Government were most anxious to avoid any misunderstanding, and laying themselves open to a charge of ill fait , by giving the impression that they were in agreement with the attitude of my ov- ernment on these po nts. JO I explained again that my draft did not ask the Afghan Government to conmit themselves on these questions. As regards Khassadars I pom e ou a the system ind cated by His Excellency had been used m the past to cover and defend the very objectionable practice by which our tribesmen were emp o\ec on the Indian sidr of the line, and said to be on leave. H As regards allowances I could not accept the refusal of the Afghan Government o discuss the subject if I received instructions bom my Government to open uch discussions. Although the Afghan Government might think that agreernent unlikely to be reached they were obliged, having accepted me as His Majesty s hnister here, to give me a civil and patient hearing. I was sure that on redection ie ’ftould not maintain the position he had taken up. il Faiz Muhammad at once admitted that he had gone too far, le h £ -d only meant that agreement would be most imoroba e. , T , , , ver the Afghan Government would of course be wi/hng t° hear whate e J y la 7- They would however prefer that mention of these three points, allowan , tfgas, and Khassadars, should be left out of the aide memoire altogether. Ul said that I had no objection to meeting their wishes in th ® a ' ! failed to see how the mention of these subjects m e way ^§8 mention “dice any views which they might hold. I would accordingly omit all mentionof them and leave the paragraph as stating that they had taken note of the attitude of my Government in regard to certain frontier matters as explained by me, and would be ready to discuss them on a suitable occasion. ^ His Excellency replied that he would ascertain whether the King and Prime Minister could accept this alteration. I remarked that I had gained the impression that the Prime Minister had been rather disappointed that the money could not be paid in sterling in London, and 1 had not quite understood the reason for his disappointment which I regretted. If, as stated in the draft aide memoire, the Afghan Government required money for extraordinary expenditure in Afghanistan, why were they so anxious for financial assistance to be given in London ? ^ Faiz Muhammad replied that it was for their normal expenditure in Europe, viz., upkeep of Legations, and expenses of Afghan students, that they had asked for payment in London. ty The next day he called again, and said that he had been up half the night with the Prime Minister discussing the first paragraph of my draft aide memoire. They had come to the conclusion that it would be far better to leave out this para graph altogether. However correctly worded it was, and however harmless its actual meaning, it would give a handle to very awkward propaganda, especial ly at a time when King Nadir Shah was receiving material assistance from His Majesty’s Government, that his Government had, in some form or other, been bribed to give us concessions on the frontier. If I was no doubt aware, His Excellency said, of the constant propaganda against King Nadir Shah spread by the Russian Embassy, that His Majesty had made a secret agreement with us on his way through India ; by certain tribesmen that he had sold Khost to us, and by the pro-Amanullah party that his policy was being dictated by the British Minister, and that he was nothing but a British puppet. All this propaganda gained credence from the King’s efforts to prevent participation by Afghan tribes in our frontier disturbances, and from his present request for material assistance from His Majesty’s Government. This request itself involved serious risk to the Afghan Government, and it was only absolute necessity that forced them to make it at the present critical juncture. The Prime Minister however had authorised him to state orally that the Afghan Government had taken note of the attitude of my Government in regard to the subjects in question ; and would be ready to discuss them on a favourable occasion ; and in addition to give the following oral assurances — The Afghan Government would not summon tribesmen from the Indian side of the line to jirgas in Afghanistan, although if such tribesmen came they would have to be treated with the consideration required by ordinary Pathan custom ; the Afghan Government would not employ Khassadars on the Indian side of the frontier, although, as already explained, tribesmen from that side of the frontier might be enlisted in their military forces and occasionally go on leave to their homes ; and that the whole frontier policy of the Afghan Government would be actuated by a desire for peace on both sides of the frontier and a spirit of true friendship towards His Majesty s Government. The Afghan Government did not however ask my Government to accept such assurances as final f but to judge their actual policy on the Indian frontier by its results. They must however ask that none of these assurances should be required in writing, for the reasons already given, and that no mention of the subject should be made in the aide memoire. I agreed to delete the whole of the first paragraph. ^ Faiz Muhammad then asked me to send him a letter stating that in regard to certain matters which had been discussed, I understood that the attitude of the ^ ghan Government was as stated in paragraphs 2 and 3v and to ask for forma confirmation. 5gjsal®fr ee ■pjTkefira. | liter lour providfd relations friendly ssms would b 3k2(B) i ifp/W aii ii Afghan Gw ■liter as to 'iteitainfrontie life payment ties red %GoveT] propose t ■'^liniste: Nafectir Merits,)11 ^®ts, ^ Idiwl rardfmppt. assiii; omekfii?

The Afghan Government have taken note of the statement made by the British Minister as to the attitude of His Britannic Majesty’s Government in regard to certain frontier matters and in particular in regard to :— (ft) the payment of allowances by the Afghan Government to members of tribes residing on the Indian side of the Indo-Afghan frontier ; [b) the summoning of the members of such tribes by Afghan officials to jirgas ; and (c) the employment by the Afghan Government of members of such tribes as Khassadars on the Indian side of the Indo-Afghan frontier. The Afghan Government are prepared to discuss such matters on a convenient occasion, and propose that in future the Prime Minister of the Afghan Government and the British Minister should sit as a permanent commission for the settlement of all questions affecting the Indo-Afghan frontier which may arise between t ic two Governments.) 2. The objects of extraordinary expenditure which the Afghan Government have immediately in view are the reorganization of their military Gives on an efficient basis (the improvement of road communications particu ai y lose towards India, and certain requirements along their frontier). The Afghan Government have no intention of expending money on objects which would be prejudicial to British interests. 3. As regards air services in Afghanistan, the Afghan Government ha\ e under consideration the conclusion of a contract with jun ers or rn } v Jf passengers and mails (inside Afghanistan between Herat, Kandahar GLazn Kabul and Basawal.)

In the course of conversations which I have recently had with His Majesty Kin' Muhammad Nadir Shah and His Highness the Prime Minister I have been given to understand that the attitude of the Afghan Government in regard to certain matters which came under discussion is as follows :— 1. The objects of extraordinary expenditure which the Afghan Government have immediately in view are the reorganisation of their military forces on an efficient basis, the improvement of road communications particularly those towards India, and certain requirements along their frontier. The Afghan Government have no intention of expending money on objects which would be prejudicial to British interests. 2. As regard$ air services in Afghanistan the Afghan Government have under consideration the conclusion of a contract with Junkers for the transport of pas sengers and mails inside Afghanistan between Herat, Kandahar, Ghazni, Kabul, and^Basawai. The Afghan Government do not expect and will not ask that His Britannic Majesty l s Government should give permission for the aeroplanes eim ployed in this service to cross the frontier into India, The Afghan Government have no agreement in force with the Government of the U. S. S.

The Afghan Government can however state that if in future any coni cession were given to Russian aeroplanes to fly over any part of Afghan territory a similar concession would be granted to British aeroplanes. I have the honour to request that Your Excellency will kindly inform me whether this is a correct statement pf the attitude of the Afghan Governmen in regard to these matters.

E. Note signed by the Afghan Foreign Minister, dated September 9, 1930. The Foreign Ministry on behalf of the Government of His Majesty Muhammad Nadir Shah accepts the offer of assistance in the form of 10,000 rifles of the same type as are used by the troops of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, with 5,000,000 rounds of ammunition, and a loan of £100,000 free of interest, made in the ’ British Legation’s aide memoire. The Foreign Ministry desires to express its sincere gratitude for this friendly action and the sympathetic attitude of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and are convinced that this friendly act of the British Government, which is an unique means of strengthening mutual confidence and es teem, will promote, both now and in the future, the friendship and goodwill existing between the two Governments. iktty i ktwiifc With regard to the promise of further assistance in four months time made by the British Government to the Government of His Majesty Muhammad Nadir Shah, provided the present good relations still exist between the two Governments, the Foreign Ministry desires to express its gratitude and to repeat the assurance, frequently given to His Excellency the British Minister, that the earnest desire of the Afghan Government is, putting aside the question of a period of four months, that the present accord may always continue between the two Governments, and that no unforeseen event may occur to mar these cordial relations. that I in ^ MCo49FD—so—19.9.30 -GIPS€S Oi 14th July on P*4543/jC (tho ^onoral qouso of this tele^aia Is 0 Uuii oly clur i( t t # dospito th© corruptions uik! the.fact tlmt a section of Part II U still undecipherable)* a® grouml has been so exhaustively covered in the Minister’s toley^ra ;s and in the Viceroy’s tolegrnn of 22nd July that it is, I su^^ftst f unnecessary to endeavour to resume tho arguments set out in th® tel8{Taphic correspondence* or to ommnt in ^-eat detail on it # It will perhaps be simplest to deal with tho question by isolating the major points on which a decision is desirable* 3, The first quastion is whether it is desirable in principle* if the necessary funds can be found* to assist Afghanistan* for purposes of internal reconstruction and tho re-establishmont of order* (a) with rifles* and (b) with money? 4. The object for which this assistance is asked (internal reconstruction and the re-establishment of order); the fact that that object is generally accepted both by the inister and by the Oovornrient of India; the fact that the request is made by the Afghan Government on its own initiative and that w© are to a large extent conmitted by the general assurance given by Sir Austen Chamberlain in 1928* are* I submit* strong arguments for abasing in Principle to the desirability of assistance. Admittedly, ^ assistance, as lr*!laoonachie points out in paragraph 5 Ms tele/ram of 14th July* involves a gamble. But* on the whole|; the risk seems to be one which is definitely worthworth taking: while, from a different standpoint, the reactions of a refusal, or of the grant, after delay, of assistance in a relatively small degree, might he unfortunate on the frontier, and might involve us in difficulties at a later period which would cost us very much more to get out of. It is relevant that the behaviour of the Afghans has sc far been admirable in very difficult circumstances. We do not of course, want to encourage Nadir to establish an 'army'* on a more extravagant scale (cp Sir D. Bray f s note on P.3828/30). And cash payments cannot be concealed. But the Minister establishes, I think a strong case for the contention that Nadir’s Government in a different portion .from Amanullah’s * Arny are being recovered only slowly: and the financial reserves of the Central Government, like their arsenals, have been depleted, and scattered, to an extent which justifies a request for assistance to replenish both in the interests of restoring central control. The Minister is satisfied (part 4 para.14 of his telegram of 14th July) that 'amounts recommended for arms and rroney* wpuld not 'be more than what is required for reconstruction * ^gJTfwe maylsuggest accept that any financial assistance will of course have to be public. It would admittedly have been infinitely preferable to give the Afghans a » But they want a gi£k, and while the political problems involved in a gift are far from simple, we we had better, I think, run the risks involved rather than spend an equivalent sum in Slanting a loan the moral effect of which will probcuuy k© as much less as the prospects of its ultimate repayment. ^ submit that the arguments in favour of action on these Hnes adduced by the Minister may be regarded as sufficient wore particularly in view of the fact th&amp;u they are accepted, after consideration, and with a full appreciation a Tof the difficultieo involvad, by the GoTernomt of India, 5, Attaains seoeotmios of tie principle that ilia desirable to halp the ti « first qaestioo le that of riflep.

The conditions of a politicalpolitical nature to to attaohod to ito payment arc discussed in sectldh below. I would, liowever, gyggBBt that if this gift ia to produce its full effect, W g giaii do I'iuch better in the case of the money, an in the'jease of the arns, to fix a period of, say, tour oaths for the pay ent of the second inatalmsnt, subject to all going well in between. The interval of 4 months suggested by the ’ inister between the first and second instalments of and rifles is, I suggest, based on bis conclusion that both the H.W.F.P, and .ladir Shah are perhaps likely to reach cottiparatively calm waters in four nontha* time (paragraph 13 of his telegram of 14th July). fflffr- -Ti (iQ-^ 9k. The next point for settlement, which is one of great importance, is whether this money shall he found from Indian revenues or by the Ko e Government. The Government of India's arguments in favour of the financing of the payment by the Home Government are set out in part II of their telegram of 23rd July, 2364-S. The telegram leaves the impression, however that (unless it is a question of finding sterling in tendon) they would probably be prepared in the last resort to find the money themselves rather than let the transaction fall throu#. and that matters would be very £ yeatly eased from their point of view if the needs of Afghanistan could be mat by rupee credits or the provision of Afghan silver currency. &lt;£*ir farther -wggestionjihftt 4i be t^ted as a loan free of interest practicabley attractive as it ie A£ghans~want an out and^ut gift. it would ^rohabiy bs difficult to cotivince- then of-our reasons for enjkuvourtfl^to offer a -can instead.-But the potatr- -met when the ti«e-oomes by loavtn^** sndsavour to secure acceptance of ^kL-l'l ?

Purpose and non-recurrent character of the (? present) gifts might be mad© clear at the same time and stress laid upon the fact that there is no intention whatever of competition for ifghan favour with third Power. * 16. ihe Coyemme nt of India are much more categorical and detailed in their reqijuregents. In the first place they are anxious that the minister should, if he thinks it possible, satisfy himself further as tx&gt; the motives of the \fghan Government in asking for the financial assistance specified by them, and particularly for a sterling payment in London (incidentally, it is not quite clear whether their criticism in part II of their telegram of 23rd ^uiy refers to the payment generally, or merely to the sterling payment, but it is., I think, probably the former). Secondly _ (subject to elucidation of the question of a sterling &lt; , payment - part IV of their telegram) they are anxious tx&gt; secure an assurance that the money will be devoted oo tin- general purposes indicated in Articj.© 0 of the treaty yu^.* &gt; the creation of a strong central Government in Afghanistan^. Lirngter thinks it impoBsibie)^ fag WifttmT* that the Afghan uoremmen.. will adout “generally friendly attitude, especially in cutters relating to interference with ou* tribes, and some conformity with usual international practice in this respect'. Thirdly, Uhey wish to reach a tnod.ua Yiv.endi with the if^ians in regard to the development of aerial conaaunications, to the extent of refusing a concession to any foreign concern on the .abul- Dakka/Oakka line, or similar line eastwards from Kandahar, and of ^granting us priority,/option on monopoly of operation of tins section; and if the Minister sees no objection, they wish him to endeavour to secure Afghan agreement to a moratorium as regards the development of air coiMiinications from i abul eastwards. (This point is further considered in paragraphs/^ 2 /below*) 17. I cannot help feeling that the line suggested by the inister in paragraph/r above is sounder than that tentatively proposed by the Government of India, ye shall destroy the effect of our present offer if we tie down the Afghans with too many restrictions. e may, indeed, leave it to the Minister to satisfy himself further so far as he can on the first point referred to by the Government of India. On the question of a guarantee that the money will be spent on the objects of article 6 of the Treaty, I think we should do better, as the Inister suggests, to intimate the purpose of the gift without requiring an assurance. As regards the proposed undertaking of non-interference with our tribes, ;r. Maconachie might be left to, indicate, if he thinks tit, that this is an underlying assumption* But 1 cannot help feeling great hesitation as to the desirability of making it a positive stipulation. After all, the ifghan attitude (which has hitherto been roost satisfactory) is likely to depend essentially on the intimacy of relatione between tadir Shah and ourselves, ’.the generous assistance now contemplated to him snould gp as far as anything can to keeping him in close relations with us, and we cannot bind him if he does not wish to be boiaid.

U&gt;T- t^y*-^** - Wi th reference to the correspondence ending with the telegram from the Foreign and Political Department, ho . 2520-S dated the 27th July 1930, I am desired to enclose for information, a copy of a summary on the subject of an air s ervice between Kabul and India* J.C.Walton, Esquire., C.B.» M * c# » Secretary, Political Department, India Office,Summary„ The attention of Hon*ble Members is invited to the accompanying telegrams and despatches from His Majesty’s Minister at Kabul? which relate to the establishment of Air Communications in Afghanistan. The position disclosed is that a representative ox the Junkers Company is now in Kabul, negotiating with the Afghan Government, for the opening of an air line from Tehran via Meshed, Herat and Kandahar to Kabul, with a possicie extension to Dacca, where an aerodrome has already been surveyed by the Germans. The Junkers Company have for some years past been operating an exceedingly emci^nt air service all over Persia, without a subsidy from the Persian Government. This the Subsidiary Company is understood to be able to do by reason of the practice of the German Government which gives a subsidy to parent manufacturing company, in vmicn it has a ling interest, for eacn macnine etc. completed. Mr. Maconachie appears to be in no doubt but that His Majesty King Hadir is set on the development of air communications between Kabul and the outside worla; that toth the Afghan Government and Junkers are in „tiv if the chance of establishing earnest, and consequently, , , „ _ and Kauuxj a British controlled monopoly between md , fr om certain implications, on which in itself ana apart nt of India had decided in -ugust the Government ^ ^ Ifo . esty , 8 Government with the implied. concurr=n ^ not to be lost early action is necessai .

After they had taken the decision of August 3.923 however the attention of the Government of India was drawn to the implications arising out of the International Air Convention, to which India is a party, and it is as mucn owing to the necessity for taking these into consideration as to events in Afghanistan that since August 1928 the c*bG has not progressed* 15. In March last, a Conference was held hy the Gepartmenub and others concerned in which it was decided that, m view of the difficulties arising from the implications abov . mentioned, the best recommendation that there could be made to His Majesty's Government with a view to the ultimate establishment of a British controlled Peshawar-Kabul air line, was for our Minister to be instructed to obtain permission of the afghan Government for a bi-weekly or weekly air service, carrying mails only, between Peshawar and Kabul to be run by Royal Air Force machines. Ho definite action, however, was taken on this decision, nor any communication made to His Majesty's Government, because of difficulties the explanation of which was not complete. These difficulties are * operated? (2) legal, arising from ^rthe^difficulties SyfLWSWdJlrbd .dove a. (3) (of course) Financial. • • -rv Dractical difficulty has been 4. (l) (a) .

Jl 1 (l)(b). These are more considerable. In the first place 5 v/itn the exception of the weekly mail service between .Karachi and Delhi, there is as yet no air mail line running in India and the commercial needs of various places in India are certainly greater than those of Afghanistan. There is also the question of Indianisation. For political reasons it has been agreed thau the Peshav/ar-Kabul service must be as nearly accident proof as possible. This means large three-engined machines, and as yet there are no Indian pilots who have been trained to fly these. Dor could this service be worked as an extension of tne proposed Indian State Air Service. The latter is avowedly experimental, and being devised almost as much for purposes of training Inuian pilots as for the carriage of mails it will at first carrg no passengers. It could not compare in efficiency with the Junxer service and could not therefore be offered as a sufficiently effective counter proposal to the plans oi tne Junker Company. Moreover, this service between Kabul and Rawalpindi justification almost entirely in political consideratioiio tmising out of our foreign relations should be dealt v/ith some t _, entirely separate from Government civil a/iation pro L&gt; i which it would not at this stage have i ound a pl^e. true that an extension of the Karachi -Delhi branch of tne Inuian State Air Service wnich is operated under contract tor 2 y by charter from Imperial Airways might axXord a ciieap tnan an entirely new service between Kabul and Rawalpindi. .. 4 -'nica onntract will end in Dec objections -.are however tnat this 1931 and is not likely to be renewed.

TheA Vide appendix III ihs actual tecimical difficulties are nowever appapently fai iioni ceing insupei”*a'ble j and tide foCo- 1 ^# ^ s opinion is that the best plan for overcoming these would he to enter into a contract for a term of years with Imperial Airways. This term should he for 3 years, if possible, hut in any case should not exceed 5 years, it being understood that at the end of that period the Indian State air Service, if in existence and capable of doing so, should operate the line. It would be well to recog nise that a further extension of the contract with Imperial Airways would be most improbable. Hor should it be assumed that Imperial Airways will be willing or in a position, ^.n view of their existing commitments, to start the service contenplated at a very early date. Enquiries will de necessary. It siaould also be remembered tnat take some months to equip the aerodrome at Rawalpindi adequately. The annual cost of a bi-weekly service between Kabul and Rawalpindi is estimated at acoat jw./ lakhs and the non-recurring expenditure at the Rawalpindi aerodrome is estimated at not more than Rs.4 lakns. In this connection it is-perhaps worth noting tn_t , . , _ c-uould be oar i passu with tae plain- recurring expenditure snouici oe ^ tenance of the service and tne initial expenditure would all be in British India, no buildings or ground establish- Tof-i in Afghanistan, a copy of tr:x ment being contemplated i S- - D.G.A.*s note is attached. r ■ ^ cv t-he difficulties . f n t he implications i.e. tnc 5.

If therefore we give permission to our private aircraft to fly over this area we must also give permission to the aircraft of other contracting States to perform similar journeys. So far as the North West Frontier Province is concerned, the only other States which are lihely to demand such permission are Russia and Germany, but neither of these is a contracting St at o : and we are not bound by the terms of our Convention in ouY' dealings with them, ks regards Russia, the Foreign i pointed out that the Union of Soviet Socialist Repuclxco,- not being a member of the League of Nations, coula oni;y accede to the Air Convention, if three-quarters ox the States already parties to the Convention voted m n^r favour# tk process which would necessarily take time.

J . . _ „ „ 1^1 o r\“p c i on: / / y V «r * ^ In regard to article 3 it introduces definite changes of sub stance, reference to which are made he low, hut in regard to article 15 it professes merely to interpret more clearly the meaning of the third paragraph of that article. Tnejpo- ceedings of the Conference on this article (appendi^) show that '‘the Conference realising the ambiguity of the terms oi the third paragraph decided to substitute therefore more precise provisions.' It had teen contended that the tmrd paragraph meant to more than that each contracting State- was at liberty to establisn international airways, iww., ground organisation, and that no other State could establish such , . . , , t q-ttm t orv of another contracting ground organisation in tno territory State without the permission of the latter. On tno it was argued that the establishment of international airways referred hot only to ground organisation but also to tne operation of those airways for which the consent oi the contracting State concerned was necessary. The Coni^n,- .

At the Conference in June 1929 she voted with the majority on both occasions. It should be explained that Germany and the United States of ^merica, though not signatories to the Convention were present at the Conference by the Special invitation of the International Commission for Air navigation 7. 'She Protocol in reference to article 3 has a very different effect. It introduces a very definite change of substance. The Legislative Department, though at first inclined to the vie?/ that tne words ''as an exceptional measure' 5 appearing in the revised article, could rt-x ci only to occasional flights have nowyidmitted that the pro/ision for previous publication and notification of exceptional authorisation must contemplate permanent exceptions. On reconsideration the Legislative Department tnereioro non agree that a permanent exception could be instituted under article 3 as revised. 8.

Some loss of prestige must he conceded, but the blow to our prestige from the inauguration by a foreign agency of an efficient service between Tehran ana DuiJv.w while we did nothing at all, would in the opinion of true Department be far greater than that arising from the admission of foreign aircraft as far as Peshawar or beyond. tnot of international complication's The second danger, tnat 01 . , j- n i r d Both are reasons for remains valid and so aocs tne t • i But are no u resisting foreign intrusion as t . 11v if tiie foreign air service is to come vital* more especially . nt r.avpa, whether we wish it or not. to our gates at paKn-? +M'n-ncial difficulties.

Both tnese assumptions are correct and are not disputed by the Finance Department.

In the other file to which I have referred a proposal, though not definitely in the form of a demand as yet, was made that a gift in kind of arms and ammunition should be made to the amir, the cost of which was estimated at Rs. 38^- lakhs which would more than absorb the balance of the fund even if it was assumed to have been accumulating since 1925. I think that the view of the finance Department must be that we must oppose the suggestion that the unspent balance of the Rs. 7 lakhs per annum should be treated as available for later expenditures it would throw on a single year a weight of expen^.itui. which would in present circumstances be exceeaingly embarrassing. 2. In dealing with tne proposal before us, I think that we should express definite agreement with the views put forward in the notes hy Sir Geoffrey Salxiond and the General Staff, tint the suggestion for a temporary service to oe run the Royal air force should not be offeree, to a -if been definitely aeciaed Afghanistan unless it xiao . , . air line at an early date, to replace it by a Civil .mr It is tne latter proposal therefore which is tne ■one which has to be accepted or rejected, and, as Mr. Howell has impressed upon me, the needfor and early decision is pressing because, if we are to act at all, v/e should act in time. 3. From the financial point of view, the proposal contemplates an initial expenditure of about Rso 4 lakhs and a recurring expenditure of about Rs. 7 lakhs* The receipts are uncertain,though Sir Francis Kurnphrys at an early stage consider^tnat we could not count on more than Rs*l lakh a year. I think that is probably an outside figure* ^s Mr. Burdon said in his note of the 30th July 1928, 'in ordinary practical life it would be difficult to find a worse proposition, in the economic sense, than that to which these papers relate,' The suggested air service, if it is agreed to, can be justified solely on political grounds, and I think that the real point to be decided is whether the political advantages from this expenditure are such as to justify our expending a sum of this magnitude, which could be more profitably expended in other directions where money is urgently required, such as improvement of education, medical facilities, etc. in the North West Frontier as well as in other central areas, ^t the discussion vnich had at Hon. Member's request with Mr. Howell I indicated to him certain points on wnich would be likely to require further information, and Mr* Howell's note of 20th June is an ^nle-J supply this information. Sd* a.C* McWatters, ■ - ‘ 27-6-30. H.M. '**+*i***nnS' t ^ ft 1. High politics and air routes may be attractive, but I think that our main duties at the moment are much nearer to the ground, o.nd I would, for example, much rather spend a similar sum of money on education and medical facilities in the N.W.F.P. 2i As far as I can understand the proposal before us converted into practical terms it is that we should make an arrangement with Imperial Airways to charter from them large passenger-carrying machines for five years to run a bi-weekly service from Pindi to Kabul, at a cost to ourselvus of R 3 .7 lakhs (no other way of providing the necessary service seems feasible). 5. Although I presume that the expenditure will be classed as political, and therefore would not have to bo voted in the Legislative Assembly, it 'would none the less become a target for severe criticism by that body, and I would mention the following special grounds for criticism First , We should be incurring heavy expenditure at a time of great financial stringency when nation-building services have to content themselves with less then their need. Secondly , We should be spending money on developing an external air route of no appreciable economic oidv^nta 0 e o India at a time when important routes in Indi,-. Have service. Thirdly , we should be running the service in cooperation with a British company, which is already suspected of Imperialistic ambitions, and with British pilots, at the cost of the Indian taxpayer. , T be argued that what we were Fou rthly , it would I think oe ar&amp; -u j. .p Tiri tish x rather than Indian seeking was the establishment th-i- advantage w 0 uld be of a precarious prestige, and ttecn even thio advanw^ o ture of the present Afghan regime. value owing to the precarious na 4.1 t. these arguiricnts, I think it difficult to attach any solid value to the arguments in favour of the proposal or to the fears on which it is based. The immediate fear appears to be that the Germans will undertake the service, and I cannot see that we should be very greatly damaged either in prestige or otherwise if they did so. On the other hand, I coni ess that I am sceptical about their really undertaking this service if it means a very heavy loss. In any case before forming an opinion as to whether the risk is serious or not, one ought to examine what are the economic prospects of the route and whether it is capable of development. It would also be interesting to have some idea of the present financial strength of the Junkers concern and whether they can risk a x serious loss. Lastly, I would ask, even if the Germans were •) x ) le are alv/ays apt to exaggerate ) the financial resources of our ) foreign competitors, and the ) readiness of foreign governments ) to subsidise unremunenative ) undertakings. ) to undertake the service, to what extent would the badjeiffects of this be offset by our running a competitive service, or rather a second service into Kabul. 5„ A secondary fear appears to be that the Russians will develop a service, but as, to this there is at present no evidence that thmy are in the field. Therefore, there is no need for any immediate decision on this ground. &amp; 6. On the general question I venture to express the vie that our prestige in Afghanistan does not depend on th's k‘ of thing but on much more solid consideration &lt;r I regret that I must oppose the proposal. 3d.

Is it possible for us to allow Persia and Afghanistan to organise an air service of this magnitude while we do nothing, and face the comparison which will inevitably he drawn when Junker passengers on reaching Dakka within two or three days of departure from Tehran are invited to. step out of their machines and proceed across India by road or rail? I submit th.at there c^n to be but one answer to this question. ' foreign and Political Depa rtment. 4. Supposing th&amp;t we do succeed in getting nignur. permission to run an air service between Rawalpindi and Kabul and do establish a service, what do we stand to gain? Much of course must depend on the attitude oi his Majesty King Nadir. If he really desires his country to be linked up with its neighbours by airways, we shall gam the credit of proving to him that we are ready to help in deed as well as in word. But this is far xrom b^m, chief advantage.

I would ask them 10 be paramount m matters remember tnat ther^to**m some wa 7 behind the offer which Junkers have made to bhe A1 S lian Government, and that very'recently the Afghan comoatant Air Force was under Russian control. The resultant situation was exceedingly uncomfortable ana not with ou t military dange r. o » Conversely, whcrt do we stand to lose if we do nothing? Tiie answer to this question, which anyone can give at present, must depend largely on the view taken of the luture of civil aviation generally. If, as some think, it is to be the means of transport of the future, the prospect of direct air communication between the Indian frontier and Berlin manipulated by a German Company very closely associated with the German Government is not one which we can afford to regard with equanimity. Then again trie re is tne question of prestige not only in Afghanistan but amongst our tribes and in India. This has already oeen dealt with in paragraphs 4 and 5 of my note dated the 9th June. I do not at the moment contend that we should go beyond the accepted policy of the 'Subsidy in kind', nor do I maintain that the establishment oi this connection is the form in which our assistance would oe most acceptable to Afghanistan or most profitable to ourselves, jjat I do contend that we must think very earnestly before we resign ourselves to 'the great political disadvantages oi a iroon (foreign) service knocking at our doors , ouia of ^,11 knocking at that at which foreigners o.re l^ot welcome. 6.

(( I fear that v;e .are in danger of delaying matters to such an extent that we shall find the Junker Company has prevailed upon the King of Afghanistan to grant them a monopoly to fly their machines up to Dakka« It is clear that our Minister at Kabul by his telegram No.48 hatodon, dated the 1 7th Jun e 9 1930, is anxious that he should be empowered to sound the Afghan Minister on the question of an India - Kabul Air Line. (( I would point out that the question of this Air connection between India and Kabul has taken up at the 11 th Meeting of the Defence of India Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence in July, 1927. The conclusion arrived at was as follows;- 'Lord Birkenhead undertook to communicate trie v T iews of the Committee to the Viceroy. Sir Fr&amp;.ncis Humphrys would then discuss the question in .m ec.tu± detail with the Viceroy, and, in the light of that decision, he could sound the Amir on his return to Kabul.' &lt;f This meeting of the Sub-Committee was in consequence of a, memorandum by Sir Francis Humphrys we. D.I. -0 &gt; the subject of the improvement of our relations with Afghanistan, in which Sir Francis recommended inter alia &lt; ■ .iy-, +• ,yoo ti pp oi a civil ail' service, the establishment and mc-int^n^n particularly a mail ana passenger service, between Kabul ana Peshawar. Such a service would be conducted by .rid would be subsidised by the Government B ritish pilot s e if I K ill i w &gt;fof India. A full year elapsed, but the project was finally accepted by the Government of India in a telegram to the Secretary of State for India, No. 1727/S dated the 27th .august, 1928, and action thereon was only held up owing to the disturbances which broke out in Afghanistan at the end of 1928. Nothing hPvS occurred since which in any way modifies the desirability of this service. On the contrary, we are now approaching the very situation it was desired to avoids the Junker firm are already knocking at our door. I do not, therefore, quite underst?-nd why it is necessar to raise the whole question of policy again, in view of the fact that the decision contained in the Government of India despatch No. 1727/S dated the 27th August, 1928, still stands. 2. I think that the proposal of the Foreign ana Political Department contained in paragraph 9 oi their minute dc.ted 20th June 1930 is based on a misconception. The proposal that the Royal Air Force should start a bi-weekly service between Peshawar and Kabul is dependent upon a del mite policy being adopted by the Government of indie, in f^./our the establishment of a civil Pindi-Kabul air line. I, and also, I feel, the General Staff, could not agree to Royal Air Force machines being employed on this service for an indefinite period. Whereas we are only too anxious to help, n ai on v-i th n view to filling the gap which must wo can only do so with a vi&amp;w o ur~fhp nscesscry me-chines and equipment necossarily occur before the ncc for a civil line can be produced.

I suggest that Mr. maconachie should be instructed to negotiate with His Majesty the King of Afghanistan for a monopoly of the Pindi-Kabul Service, offering in the meantime, pending the necessary arrangements being made with a civil Transport Firm, to fill the gap with a bi-weekly mail service con ducted by the Royal Air Force between Peshawar and Kabul. It might be that the King of Afghanistan would be only too pleased to accept such an offer, in which case wo should f ind ourseIves in a. very strong position, not only to derive political and military advantages which such a monopoly would confer on us, but also to ensure that we should nou Ou bartering away the future interests of India in view of the certain importance of Air Transport in the future in linking up the internal systems of India with Central Europe.

It seems c Crfi nQ ral Sta ff Brc-iicii • le&amp;r to us that the inauguration of a Britishfor British civil air line between Kabul and India, has, some time past, been the accepted policy, not only of the Government of India, but of the Committee of Imperial Defence and . of His Majesty’s Government 0 Hot only is biiero no reason to go back on this considered and accepted policy, out the advances of the Junkers Company to the Afghan oruvei nment make it necessary that action should be taken not; to implement the policy., If not we shall probably Da confronted with a foreign service in operation to Dakka, tne loss of any hope of a British monopoly, and possibly an outwardly German but in reality Russian monopoly on the Kabul r oute. u 2. Although there is no note from Finance Department on this file it appears that the main obstacle to an offer to Afghanistan of a British civil line is the provision of funds, and that consequently there may be a tendency, as pointed out by Air Officer Commanding in paragraph 2 of his note of 24tii June 1930, to continue indefinitely the proposed Royal Air Force service.. We agree with the Air- Officer Commanding that this preliminary Royal Air force service should be regarded as a temporary stop-gap only, and that it should not bo offered to Afghanistan unless it has been definitely decided to replace it at an early date by a civil air line. The commitments of the Royal Air S-rce in its legitimate sphere are, we think, such as to make it most undesirable that it should undertake tin r7 - c ^ ^ J - any long or indefinite period. 3. wo recommend that an attempt should be made at once to reach a favourable decision on the financial question, and that the Minister habul should take action as proposed tary’s note of 9th June 1930, ordance with Forminka in paragraph 6 of Foreign Secre unless he has already done so xn c,,cc tf No. 22 of 21st June 1930.

This is a point to uhich Foreign Secretary has drawn attention with some emphasis in paragraph 5 of his note of 20th June 1930, and before that in paragraph 4 of 9th June 1930. On reflection I feel I have not supported Foreign Secretary in this mattei to the extent which the importance and force of his aignm 'merit. From the point of view of civil aviation in th.n, country the position is this.

He also mentioned possibility of a service to be operated by Junkers from Kabul to Dakka from which place onwards traffic would travel by road to India.

He said that site for aerodrome at Dakka had already been surveyed by German:a As Junkers would presumably stipulate f 0 r monopoly on Kabul-Dakka ooction, decision as to policy of His Majesty's Government in regard to British participation in India-Kabul air line seems to be matter of urgency now.

If this conclusion is correct Junkers would apparently have to find some means of insurance against possible loss on working, e.g., either a direct guarantee by the Afghan Government (which seems to be out of the question) or else a guarantee or subsidy given by the German Government. I have no information as to the general policy of the German Government in regard to Civil aviation but am informed by the Persian Ambassador that they pay Junkers no subsidy in connection with this Company’s operations in Persia. 5. Sir Robert Clive, in paragraph 28 of his Annual Report on Persia (1928), remarks that Germany “ has evidently decided to resume in a modified form her old policy of ‘ Drang nach osten ’ and if she wished to promote Junkers in terests in Afghanistan she could in existing circumstances do so at little practical expense to herself. Amanullah Khan on his return from Europe announced that he had obtained a credit of six million marks from Germany and although this figure may not be quite accurate, both Dr. Pauschardt who is in charge of German interest here, and Herr Ereye, the local manager of the Deutsch-Afghanische Company, have told me that their Government is pressing—so liquidation of this debt. far without any success—for the Should the German Government now decide xnai n ib Y y •. , • seems conceivable that they might waive their claim, in whole or m part, in i e- turn for the grant by the Afghan Government of an an monopo &gt; .o . un w together possibly with the payment of a small annual subsidy intended to co\e information to show that the probable margin of loss.

Apparently in the particular case now in question the scheme would be to float a Portuguese Company with headquarters at Goa. As Portugal, unlike Germany, is an adherent to the Air Convention, the Government of India would probably find it out of the question to take any steps to prevent a Portuguese Company from flying between Karachi and Colombo. If this scheme were to materialise, there would, I suppose, be some risk of it undercutting an Indian subsidised company, but I gather that the German Government are now showing a tendency to make drastic cuts in aviation subsidies and this may result in a curtailment of Junkers » activities. All possible eventualities will no doubt be thoroughly considered at the Inter-departmentd conference which, as you will see from the official telegram, is to be convened to consider the question of foreign air companies operating in India, hut as Chetwynd i^ have spoken to you about the question, I thought it as veil to let you know personally of this correspondence that Hoare and Cunlif fe-hister have had with me, and to ^,ita your attention to the risk, such as it is of ... for^i fa n company getting a hold on one important air route across^jUflLSRS 1 ffORBIG-IT xiCTI Vj TIRS, ii2_k§™]RY.—RjrJRil. A vi:- tion Directore te. h Uiorough search h&lt;-.s been ni^de through our i ecords ? but very little deiinite infonurtion bearing on the point in question is available.. Practically all Junkers efforts in the past have been directed towards the extension of their manufac turing activities rather than towards the development of air transport as such. Thus in the case of Russia the important part of their contract with the Soviet Government provided for the organise tion of factories. Only incidentally were they granted concessions for the operation of certain air lines, and as far as we know there was no question of any Russian subsidies being granted. A few experimental services were opera ted without much success s s ran nd even before the final withdra wal of Junkers from the Hu ctories all attempts at the organisation of air services had &gt; p ^ C! p rl t AS ..

The Bulgarian Company 'Bounavad' which was formed in 1927 with the assistance of Junkers is to receive a small subsidy repayable to the Government at the end of the concessionary period of 10 yearso The company has so far opened only one of the three routes definitely provided i or in its contract with the Government. It is stated that Junkers interested themselves in the formation of this company solely with the idea of eventually securing the erection on Bulgarian coil of a factory for the assembly of their machines. Hoy, far the Company will carry out the contract remains to be seen; they are already in default in starting services. Junkers efforts to start a service in South Africa perhaps, the nearest parallel that can be found to the proposals for India. In this case Junkers representatives negotiated-the heads of an agreement with the 3ou&amp; African Government, but &lt;t the last moment brought forward new demands and the agreement^ fell through.

The Junker firm had two branches 9 one of which was already established for the manufacture of aircraft and the otnerj which was brought into being soon fter the war# for the operation of services using these aircraft. In 1924, the Junker Company, which up to that time had un been operating not;successful services in co-operation with various small undertakings and municipalities, evolved a scheme whereby it was hoped to get control of the majority of services in Europe and in other parts of the world, and thereby creating a permanent market for their output of air craft. With this object in view they formed two organisations u the Nord Europe, Union and the Trans-Eropa Union, each with subsidiary companies in various countries and in Germany itself. It was intended eventually to combine these two companies into one organisation to be known as the Europe Union. These Junker controlled organisa tions were in direct compgetition with the Aero Lloyd, A.G* which was forced from a combination of several small purely German companies which had the support of the Government, of Banks and oi shipping 1 ines. The Junker method of spreading its influence, largely with a view to selling its machines, was to sell aircraft to companies in return for shares in those companies, these shares as a rule representing a major holding. u , , rin+ op-ree to be embodied in the Unio: national comps,ny would not ag ■ oca national companies '^u^ financed rival companies disguised a . &gt; ^s was done in Denmark and by Junkers were formed such o, Holland.

Note on the proposed CIIAKLALA landing ground. The present landing-ground at Pindi is inside the racecourse. The ground is also used for polo, but by careful arrangements between R. A. F. and Army, there has up to date been no interference with polo or races. The ground is not a good one ; it is rather small and the air approaches are bad. For this reason and to obtain more freedom the R. A. F. have for some time been considering the transfer of the landing-ground to CHAKLALA which lies some 6 m. east ot Rawalpindi and which is connected to it by a good metalled road. A large Arm&gt; M. T. Depot is situated at Chaklala, and the workshops provide facilities for re pairs on a considerable scale. The M. T. Depot and British Quarters lie south of the railway and the Indian artificers quarters lie north of it. Close along-side the artificers quarters an old landing-ground site exists. It has not been used for six years and has probably never been used at all. It is small, 500 x X 420 x and the approaches from the south are considerably blocked by high trees along the road. It is, however, capable of easy extension to the north and east, and if this extension were carried out, the R. A. F. could obtain a very suitable ground for an expenditure of about Rs. 20,000. About the middle of 1927 the R. A. F. put forward definite proposals to take up and extend this site. The Army asked the R. A. F. to hold up the case until a decision was reached with regard to the rsiting of the proposed extensions to the M. T. Depot. In case the Army wanted the old site, search was^ made for another site which was found ahmit son x further east - Tllls site is within the cantonment boundary on private land and will have to be acquired. The Army have since informed the B. A. F. («) They would have no objection to the R. A. F. acquiring the new site as it would not interfere with any proposed extension. , (0 That they did not intend to build on the old site in 1928-29 and might not build there at all. If the E. A. F. would wait a few months they might find that they could get the old site after all. ^ This is the present position. The new site would cost about Rs 70 000 i e 100 acres at Rs. 600 for acquisition and Rs. 10,000 to prepare. This does not allow foi watei, buildings, etc. The old site would cost Rs. 20,000 approximately Whereas, however, the Army might agree to the R. A. F. taking over the old site they would we think certainly not agree to its being used as a civil aerodrome as it would be impossible or very expensive to carry out future extensions if a civil aerodrome was once established. For a civil aerodrome therefore the new site is essential. 12th July 1928. (Sd.) J. F. TURNER, Lieutenant-Colonel, R.E. WIRELESS AND METEOROLOGICAL SERVICE. (1) Wireless .-—I do not think that it is essential to provide for a wireless station at Rawalpindi. Land line communication with Peshawar is good, and meteorological reports, etc., can be transmitted by this means. The Posts and Telegraphs Department has a W.|T. ( 6 K. W.) and D.|F. station at Peshawar, which can be made available for working with aircraft. If any additional capital expenditure is necessary, it will not be more than £200 for a new D.jF. receiver. F. and P. Department will probably have to pay the Posts and Telegraphs Depart ment for services rendered. Sir Francis Humphreys informed me that it would not be possible to pro vide our own wireless and D.jF. station at Kabul but that we should have to make use of the existing French station, which is, I believe, operated by Afghans. I confess that I feel very grave doubts as to whether this arrange ment will prove to be satisfactory. For the safe and efficient operation of ibis route it is absolutely essential that we should be able to obtain punctual weather reports from Kabul. It is equally desirable that the Kabul operators should be able to work with aircraft, so that weather changes can be reported to aircraft in flight. Director of Wireless informs me that the operation of the Kabul station is extremely bad and I am therefore very doubtful as to whethei we- shall be able to obtain an efficient wireless service. (2) Meteorological—I have not had an opportunity of discussing this question with the Director General of Observatories and I do not know whether he has any observers at Rawalpindi. The R. A F. have a Meteorological Officer at Peshawar, who could provide reports and forecasts from this station. Sir Francis Humphreys intimated that he might be able to arrange for a .member of his staff to take observations at Kabul, which would tqymffted to Peshawar by wireless. Some arrangement will have to be made to obtain re ports from Jalalabad during such periods as the service terminates there. NOTES. m Pnr,? ? Salaries In order to cover leave and possible sickness three Ilots twe befi provided for For a service which is only scheduled to fly or 515 machine Ws per annum, this is most extravagant, as there is no eason why one pilot should not accomphsh this am^to ^ n any case, we may assume that the op ‘ r f p third pilot will only be ake additional routes in which case the services ot a hargeable to the Kabul route, when they a _ . 7 r-.' _ t no vp allowed the sum of £300 for a (2) Page 3 Capital expert i • 0 f British personnel from their notor transport vehicle for the con ' spares e tc. I assume that pas- .esidences to the aerodrome and ioi stoies, spait &amp; ,sengers will find their own way to and from the aerodrome. With fares fixed at such a low rate, it could hardly be expected that tfie operating company would provide transport from Rawalpindi to the aerodrome and vice versa. ( 3 ) Page 6, Estimated Revenue. — {a) I have provided for fares on the basis given by Sir Francis Humphreys. It seems to me, however, that at the rates suggested the service will soon be swamped (provided there is no very great difficulty about passports) by sightseers anxious to visit Kabul ; this will be detrimental to the interests of the Indian trader for whom this service is primarily intended. It cannot be expected that fares on any unsubsidised ser vice which the company may desire to run, e.g., to Kashmere, can be fixed at anything like these figures and this may give rise to unfavourable comment by the general public. The same thing will apply to the cross India subsidised service on which w T e shall expect the operating company to obtain as high a re venue as possible. (b) I obtained my information as to the revised useful load of the “ Her cules ” from Mr. C. F. Wolley Dod, Chief Pilot on Imperial Airways Cairo- Basrah service, but I cannot guarantee its accuracy. The main point is that the machine should be able to maintain its height with full load wffien flying with any two engines. I am not sure that this would be the case on this route when carrying a load of 3,500 lbs. (4) Page 8, Chaklala Aerodrome. — {a) There has not been time to go into these estimates in detail, but I do not think that it is likely that the sum of Rs. 4 lakhs will be exceeded. (b) I have assumed that the British personnel of the operating company will be able to find living accommodation in Rawalpindi. Under standing charges 1 have allowed the sum of £1,000 for rents, rates, etc. This should be sufficient to cover the rent of this accommodation and such rent as the Govern ment of India may decide to charge for office, workshops, stores, garage and menials quarters. Office, workshops and stores will be provided in the annexes to the hangar which can be sub-divided as required. If it should be necessary to build living accommodation for British personnel on the aerodrome the amount allowed should represent a satisfactory return on the capital involved. (c) I have provided for a hangar that will accommodate considerably more than the two machines required for this service. Under standing charges I have provided the sum of £720 per annum for landing and housing fees for these two machines at the rate of Rs. 400 per month per machine. The operating company and any other user of the hangar would, of course, pay for the housing and land ing of other machines and a fair revenue should be obtainable by Government from both sources. {d) I have assumed that no charges will be raised by the Afghan Govern ment for the use of the aerodromes at Kabul and Jalalabad.

It will govern future negotiations between the Government of India and H,IL the Amir of Afghanistan relating to the establishment of a Kabul -Peshawar air-route, but it does not govern the right of the Government of India to declare the M.vi.P,P. tj0 a prohibited area, or its right to permit its own national air-craft to fly over a defined tract in the K.w.if.r. as 'an exceptional measure in the interest of fee public safety'. I also set aside arguments based on proposals by particular contracting States or groups of contracting States, and confin the discussion to Article 3 and the Protocol to it, in the form accepted by the International Commission as a whole. . ,, tb^rp can be no doubt the?.t under Hi'.. 2 o 'g To begin with, there c^n first paragraph of Article 3 the Government of India is entitled, for military reasons, to declare the d.b.S.-. + an -pp r can we find jus ti-t -l bo a prohibited area.

The phrase consists of tv/o distinct parts- (1) exceptional measure, and (2) in the interest of the public safety. As regards (1) it is impossible at present and unnecessary, to devise any formula which would ;_,iV'„ an adequate account of what constitutes an 'exceptional measure' for the pruposes of Article 3. Such a formula may be evolved in course of time, but for the present- it is enough to state a particular case ana see if it falls within the obvious and indisputable limits of the term. Our particular case relates to that portion ox a proposed Kabul-Peshawar air-route which will run more or less in a direct line from Peshawar to the British Indian border. Along this narrow strip it is proposed to authorise flight by the air-craft of a specified company, whicn .ill fly at stated intervals, and at stated heights perhaps, on to the control of the and will be subject at all time r TnrM° (I &amp; L.

The Government 01 has now a permanent legation in Kabul, and the two States ; are on friendly terms, inter-oourse between British i India and Afghanistan is likely to increase. The land routes between the two countries, however, run through a belt of tribal territory, vhero passage is at times attended with risk and is frequently perilous.

In particular, proposals from the German firm Junkers for an air service from Persia, and Russian proposals for an air bridge across Afghanistan, for the purpose of delivering mail between India and Europe. It also includes discussion as to the feasibility and desirability of a counter British service from India to Afghanistan; this includes examination of who could provide this service, proposed service frequency, the types of aircraft that could be used, and expense estimates. The file also contains comparisons between the proposed Russian air bridge and existing Imperial Airways services between the United Kingdom (UK) and India to judge the commercial viability of the new service. To a lesser extent, the file also contains details of a gift of rifles and ammunition from the Government of India to the Government of Afghanistan.The focus of discussion is Britain's desire to limit the encroachment of foreign (i.e. non British) companies towards the frontier of her Indian Empire; in particular British officials are concerned with limiting the development of services by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). The financial problems of the Government of India also factor into this discussion, as an issue preventing the provision of a British service. The file therefore contains a number of notes — or aide memoirs — of a number of meetings held by HM Minister at Kabul with either the King of Afghanistan (Mohammad Nadir Shah) or his Foreign Minister. The volume also contains some discussion of the legal status of the North West Frontier under the International Air Convention, and the extent the Government of India can maintain its status as a prohibited area following the advent of civil air services.The French content consists of a short extract on folio 128 from the International Postal Convention. The volume also contains an extract from Jane's
                           All the World's Aircraft, 1929on folios 421-2, an extract from
                           The Timeson folio 346, and a copy of Imperial Airway's winter 1931-2 timetable on folios 76-7.The main correspondents are as follows: HM Minister at Kabul (Richard Roy Maconachie), officials of the Air Ministry, officials of the India Office, officials of the General Post Office, and representatives of the Foreign Department of the Government of India.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year.
