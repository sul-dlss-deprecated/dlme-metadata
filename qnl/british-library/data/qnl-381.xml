Since the Turks were expelled from Qatlf it has been the cmstofc in the Political Agent's court that when a defendant has gone there a letter has been sent to the Amir askin. hi® to recover tne money or send the man to appear in court , and help in such cases has been given . In one case Shaikh 'Abd-al-'Aziz was thanked for the energetic steps taken by the Amir. Recently I sent three such letters to the Amir. Shaikh 'Aod-al-'Aziz has no,/ written objecting to this procedure and saying that there are Shara' and civil courts in Qatif and that if Bahrain subjects or others have claims against his subjects they should be jsransferred to his Amir who would send them to those courts. He awaits a reply to the above effect. This opens what may prove an Hwkward question and I should be glad of an indication of the reply to De returned. ' Addressed Basrah repeated Bushire.

Procedure hs been confined to absconding debtors am-ong them subjects of Bin Sa'ud , not necessarily suojects of Qatif. I think Bin oa'ud's claim well-founded , but hesitated v;ithout reference to higher authority to send British subjects or protected## persons to an oriental court of Justice where we are not represented. Such cases are however at present few and our influence should suffice to get our claims dealt with satis- factprily. Suggest replying^ that such procedure was followed in tiie past so I adhered to it, but in future will send Plaintifts in such cases to Amir with letters of intrdduction and tru-jt /mir in exercise his good offices on their behalf.

It apDears to me that former procedure was correct In the case of debtors absconding from Bahrain to Bin 3a'ud 1 s territa ory: in tne c&amp;&amp;&amp; event of one of his subjects absconding to Bahrain to escape from his creditors ,3in Sa'ud would probably ask for his return. As regards ordinary petitioners ; if they made a cliim agaiit a man in Qatif or Haaa they should be told that the court has _ T no jurisdiction in those places. If applicant states he intends to go to Qatif to prosecute his claim and asks for letter he might be given letter to the A-iir . I think it would be expedient to give introductory letters to British subjects and protected persons, and Persians and not to people from Qatar and Arabian ma nland except 'Oman.

Ruler of Najd. to Lieut- Colonel Sir Percy Cox, the ;on'ble Political Resident and Consul-General in the Persian Gulf and the Chief Political fficer in Uecopotaiaia. I have the honour to state that I have written and cont you several letters but have received no replies, as L have been deprived from same for a long time owing, as I consider tc your being busy with most urgent and important work, and your business being so much, you are to be excused for not sending the replies soon, even the informations you conveyed to me in your letters which I had the honour to receive regarding ny personal concerns which you were to let me know in detail; but I do not oee any reply about then. It has become necessary for me to worry Your Honour for reasons which have compelled me to do; I have got information in these days from my tribesmen whom I trust very much that the tribe of Al Ajman have intended to proceed to Ibn Rasheed and mentioned to me to obstruct them from going to the above mention-^ ed, and they have proceeded as they alleged and I have not obstructed them in compliance with your exalted communication although I am not ignorant of their evil thoughts which are concealed and which they conceal from my friend the mgh iSntish Government and me, and certainly if it was not for your communi cation to me about the said tribe, I would not have let them go; but I did so only in consideration of your communication, now they and the 'Ehammar' have joined together and I hope, God, will separate them. The second problem stands that the caravans which start from Kuwait for Najd and other territories and about which I Have written in several of my letters already sent to )four Honour but do not see any reply to them, however, as I am aware of the nature of the Arabs and the truth of their circumstances it■i 3a I -J I it has necessitated me to let you know with reference to your orders prohibiting goods from Kuwait to enemy towns - I mean such as Hail, Medina and other than these, that the desired fruit (i.e.,benefit) has not been procured therefrom; but have resulted in my disadvantage and that of my subjects and in the advantage of Ibn Rasheed and his subjects and the Turkish Govern ment and as regards the disadvantage which has turned on me, aBter I had issued the notification and given strict orders to all the Amirs in my dominions to the effect that nothing should the traderr go out to the aforesaid places and owing to bad market/removed from Hajd to Kuwait and her dependancies because the tribesmen of Ibn Rasheed who forwarded to Kuwait have promised those who who send goods to Hail and the dominions of^the Turkish Governmen that they Trill be safe from the tribesmen of Ibn Rasheed. Also the merchants residing in his dominions and the dominions of the Turkish Government carry these as they are in need of a liveli hood and carry them safely to the towns mentioned above where they sell them at double prices, and this is not hidden from any one; if I describe to you the loads carried to these towns at least 2000 camels every month and no doubt the harm reaches the two sides and now no result as was desired has been obtained out of these restrictions but only that there was a mere name without the least benefit, and there is not the slightest doubt that your intelligence and intellect have well understood the conditions stated above, and they are also not hidden from you and if you want to obtain results as desired and advantages to the two sides you should press Ibn Subah to sever his present relations altogether with Ibn Rasheed and undertake to lead the High ways of friends with the/British Government and as regards his friendship with Ibn Rasheed it is contrary to the analogy of wisdom and logic that he should have any friendship' with Ibn Rasheed while he is on the side of the Turks atid enemy of my friend the High British Government and her friends; if it is impossible to cut off the relations with Ibn Rasheed there will of course be grounds for suspicion about Najd people, because whatever goes out they declare it in their own name and afterloT after it has left Kuwait for k outside they direct It to Hall and the neighbourhood of the Turtleh Government, this will be a cause to my disadvantage for two reasons - Firstly becauoe I do not like that my friend should he under any doubt that any goods go out in the name of my subjects and then are directed towards the enemy, and further I consider that the aeslotance of the British Government ta be afforded t J goods for Hajd people to go to Juball and for this I undertaKe that nothing out of the goods which arrive for the abovementloned port will go out to the enemy sides and I will turn iiajd people to It and I will be then at rest. I hope you will pay your attention to these problems and let me know all about your health and welfare. With the permanence of your friendship to„ards your friend.

Captain Shakespear could make no other reioinder than that the British Government confined its mtere ^. * 0 . ^ and had never challenged Turkish claims to the ordering of affairs m Central Arabia with which we had no concern ; that we were moreover on amicable terms with Turkey and should be averse from anything in the natur Hntri&lt;me asrainst the Ottoman Government, but in his comments on the report of this interview, Sir Percy Cox pointed out that as the Porte seemed disposed to be intractable in the adiustment of matters relating to British interests m the P If ' p ^nld not afford to ignore ibn Sa'ud's attitude. His personal authority had sreatl v^ncreased!and it would be well to entertain cordial if distant relations tithbim. The Foreign Office, however, decided that it was impossible at thau time to swerve from our policy of strict non-interference. . . + • i + Two vears later ibn Sa'ud, without the assistance which he had tried to obtain from us, though he was credited throughout Arabia with having seemed it overran the Hasa, ejected without difficulty the small Turkish garrisons and established himself on the coast at Qatif and Ojair. Captain Shakespear, on his return to England in June 1914, from a long projected journey across Arabia in the course of which he had visited Riyadh bore witness to the strong nersonal domination which ibn Sa'ud's vigorous and commanding personality established and from other reports it was clear that he was regarded be von dhisown 'f rout ie is as the coming man. He proved more than a match inffFective efforts of the Turks to retake the Hasa, they resorted to diplomacy and opened negotiations with him through Saiyid Tabb of Basra . Earlv in May Tal'at Beg had formulated m private conversation at the British 'Pmbassv the expectations of the Ottoman Government m terms which seemed to his hearers little consonant with actual conditions. He proposed to estab lish a strictly delimited frontier between ibn Sa'ud and ibn llaslnd, place icpie- sentatives of the Sultan at Riyadh and at Hail, and rely upon the guile of these nffioiils to control without the aid of force the actions of the two Amirs. As ^ tt h L , ibn. Sa'ud would bo ^pointed Mutasarrif of the P~ ; but the collection of the customs would remain in luikish hands garrisons would be replaced in the ports. Nothing was more certain than that ibn Sa'ud appearance on the coast nXmatelv brin' him into direct contact with ourselves whether we w^comedH or sought to avoid it; and this anxiety underlay and possibly aroelerated the action of the Porte.

As a strict Wahabi, the new Wali of Najd looked with abhorrence on the loose religious principles of the Turks and was far from admitting their pretensions to represent and direct Islam. He had, in conversation with Captain Shakespear, spoken with unexpected vehemence on this point, saying' that in his eyes the infidel was preferable to the Turk, since the latter broke the rule he professed to follow while the former acted in accordance with his own law, and to the same listener he declared that he had accepted the terms of the agreement only because he was assured privately that even the . , „ on t , small measure of sovereigntv accorded to Arab Bureau, 22nd July 1916. mi u i i • i mi Turkey would never be claimed. The Kuwait treaty was put to the test by the outbreak of the European war and found wanting. The disquieting attitude adopted by Turkey on the outbreak of war between Germany and the Entente Powers produced a profound altera tion in our policy towards the Porte. It became necessary to reckon up our assets in Arabia, and early in October Captain Shakespear, who was in England, was ordered to return to the Persian Gulf and get into touch with Ibn Sa'ud so as to prevent if possible the outbreak of unrest in the interior, and in the event of war with Turkey to ensure that no assistance should be rendered from that quarter. Before he could reach his destination war had been declared. A message had been despatched to ibn Sa'ud informing him of Captain Shakespear's impending visit, recognizing his position in JS T ajd and the Hasa and guaranteeing him against reprisals by sea or land if he would commit himself to enter the lists against Turkey. The Turks, on their side, lost no time in approaching the Amirs of Central Arabia. Their scheme, which was that ibn Ilashid should aid in the campaign against Egypt while ibn Sa'ud opposed the British advance in ALesopolauiia, showed thi^t—wt?,^—ast- unaware of the feeling towards them which prevailed among the Arabs as they were ignorant of tbe conditions of the desert, where the network of tribal feud permits no man to withdraw his forces on a distant expedi tion without fear of attack on his unprotected possessions Ibn Sa'ud, apparently in order to gain time, took advantage of his abiding enmity with ibn Ilashid and launched into open hostilities against him. In vain Enver Pasha urged him to abandon private quarrels, sent him a gift of money for the expenses of co-operation with the Sultan's armies, and ultimately entrusted Saiyid Talib with the task of bringing about a re conciliation. At this juncture Saiyid Talib was busily engaged in endeavour ing through the intermediation of Shaikh Khaz'al and His Majesty's Consul at Muhammareh to drive a bargain with the British Government providing for his adherence to us in the event of war with Turkey, but the terms which he put forward were so extravagant as to be impossible of acceptance, and he w T as still hesitating over Shaikh Khaz'al's advice to him to abate them when the declaration of war left him stranded. Then it was that he saw in his proposed deputation to Najd a providential means of escape from Basrah where his position had now become highly precarious, and he left hurriedly for Ibn Sa'ud's camp, via Zubair. Meanwhile the Wahabi Chief, in response to Turkish ex hortation, had pleaded that he could spare no troops for the 'Iraq till he had reduced ibn Eashid to his rightful state of vassalage. To the British message he replied that he was unshaken in his long-standing desire for intimate rela tions with us. But he was not unnaturally reluctant to take open part with us until he was satisfied that our change of front towards himself was likely to be permanent, and in spite of his personal confidence in Captain Shakespear it was with some misgiving that he consented to his visit. The meeting took place on December 31st at Khufsah near Majma' in Sudair. Ibn Sa'ud spoke with great frankness. Before compromising himself wholly with the Turks he asked that our assurances of support should be embodied in a formal treaty,tTie terms of which were drafted forthwith. They included a guarantee of complete independenfce on our part and an undertaking on the part of ibn Sa'ud that he would have no dealings with other Powers except after reference to the British Government. He informed Captain Shakespear that lie had been in communication with the Sharif and with the heads oL' the northern 'Anazah confederation and that they were resolved to stand together. He was holding.in detention a party of four envoys sent by the Turks to urge him to join ibn Hashid in a jihad against us, but al ter consultation with Captain 8hakespear the Turkish mission was dismissed with the reply that ibn Rashid s forces were camped within two days of ibn Sa'ud and that there could now be no question of peace between them. On January 17th a messenger arrived from Mecca bearing a letter from the Sharif's son ' Abdullah who wrote that the Sharif had been called upon to proclaim the jihad and was temporizing till he heard what line ibn Sa'ud proposed to take. Ibn Sa'ud made answer that he saw no advantage to the Arabs in joining the Ottoman Government and had himself dismissed a Turkish deputation empty-handed. Upon the reports sent by Captain Shakespear from ibn Sa ud's camp, Sir Percy Cox was authorised to proceed with the negotiations for the treaty, but on January 24th battle was joinel between ibn Sa'ud and ibn Rashid and Captain Shakespear, unarmed and present only as a spectator, met his death. Ibn Sa'ud's version of the disaster was that he was • shot dead by a Shammar rifle-bullet, but this statement is in any case based only on second-hand m- formatlon, as it is undisputed that Captain Shakespear had taken up a position in a different part of the field than that where his host was located. Since then various and divergent accounts of what happened have been recited, one of little more value than another, but the balance of evidence goes to show that he was first wounded in the leg and disabled, and soon afterwards killed in the charge of ibn llashid s cavalry 'which overwhelmed the flank on which he was posted. In the saave qui pent which ensued it is feared that he was either abandoned or forgotten, but the precise * circumstances of his untimely death will probably never be ascertained. Ibn Sa'ud expressed profound regret for the loss of one whom he regarded as a brother, and always refers to him with respect and affection. The action was indecisive: both parties claimed the victory and both were temporarily crippled and forced to retire. It was an unexpected and a somewhat disconcerting result, for ibn Sa'ud's preparations had been made on an exceptional scale and his forces were said largely to outnumber these of ibn Hash id, though he was inferior in cavalry. The accounts given by the Arabs attribute his defeat to the treachery of the 'Ajman. Ibn Sa'ud's personal courage is beyond question, but he not uncommonly falls short as a tactician, and Mubarak of Kuwait pronounced him to be a poor leader in battle. But if he had not dealt ibn Eashid a crushing blow, he had at least put him out of action and prevented him from joining the lurks, as he unquestionably would have done. The intervention of ibn Rashid in the early part of the Mesopotamia n cairj.paign might have added considerably to our diLlicuUies. Nevertheless Captain Shakespear's death was a heavy price to pay for the advantage of immobilizing him. The two chiefs held apart without further hostilities till the summer when an agreement dated June 10th was concluded between them. Ibn Rashid recognised ibn Sa'ud's claims, except that of overlordship which he could scarcely be expected to acknowledge, and undertook Arab Bureau, herewith ^.closed. not to play a treacherous game towards the Turkish Government but to incline towards whichever Government was in alliance with ibn Sa'ud. He confined his own jurisdiction to Hail and its villages and the Shammar tribes, while ibn Sa'ud was acknowledged to hold all Najd irom A1 Khahaf to Dawasir. A1 Khahaf is no doubt the Kahafah of Hunter's map, a little north of latitude 27°. In a tribal country the adjustment of frontiers can never be very exact, but it is clear that ibn Rashid renounced all pretensions to the Qasim, a province whose rich oases had frequently changed hands. It is of interest to note that the tribes reckoned as subject to ibn Sa'ud are the Mutair, 'Ataibah, Harb, Bani'Abdullah, 'Ajman, Murrah,I Manasir, Bani Haja, Subai, Sahul, Qahtan and Da^asir, but this catalogue niust not be taken as exact, for the Mutair are mostly in Kuwait territory and the 'Ataibah and Harb come for the gieiter part under the Sharif. After Captain Shakespear's death ibn Sa'ud sent an immediate request that another officer should be accrediteJ to him cr, failing this, that negotia tions should continue through his agent in Basrah, 'Abdul Latif Mandil. Xo suitable officer was available, but ibn Sa'ud was advised to sign a pre liminary agreement on the lines of Captain Shakespear's draft and leave all details to be settled later. He signed and returned the new draft which had been sent to him but with some important modifications concerning which it seemed better to postpone further discussion till a meeting with the Chief Political Officer could be arranged. For the time therefore the conclusion of the treaty was suspended, ibn Sa'ud being wholly engaged with internal affairs. His position at home at this epoch was the reverse of secure. His reputation among the tribes had suffered from the unsuccessful operations against ibn Eashid during which he had incurred much loss in material and equipments, and during the greater part of 1915 he was engaged with a dangerous rising in the Hasa on the part of the 'Ajman. He himself believed that the revolt was instigated by the Turks and Ibn Rashid, but it is doubt- lul whether his view was correct. Mubarak of Kuwait was convinced that there was no evidence to support it, but Mubarak, during the last few years of his reign, was not a lenient critic of ibn Sa'ud's difficulties. His opinion is so far borne out that the troubles with the 'Ajman seem Arab Bureau, 25th Juij 1916. ^ ^ b ®? UD , wi . th . the occupation of the Hasa by the Amir in 1913. Tj p to that time the tribe had been on good terms with him and had generally recognized him as suzerain, but the extension of his direct authority to the Hasa, which is their headquarters, had strained their allegiance. He attempted to impose a poll tax upon them and stopped them from taking dues from caravans passing through the country, a toll which they had been accustomed to exact in the days of the Turks. The discontent of the 'Ajman was fanned by members of ibn Sa'ud's family who had long been at enmity with him, the 'Araif, grandsons of his uncle Sa'ud. Two of the 'Araif cousins, Fahad ibn Sa'ud and Salman ibn Muhammad, had taken refuge with the Shaikh of Bahrain. The Shaikh made a half-hearted attempt to patch up a reconcilia tion in 1914, but the 'Araif refused his mediation and sought the protection of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, from whom they received some countenance when hostilities were renewed with ibn Sa'ud in 1915. The rebellion now assumed serious proportions. Ibn Sa'ud sent for more troops from 'Riyadh and asked help from Kuwait, but before the arrival of either reinforcement he attached the 'Ajman by night near Hofuf and met with a reverse, due partly to the cowardice of the Hofuf town levies. His brother Sa'ud was killed and he himself wounded. For a time his fortunes were at a very low ebb. He was in want of money and arms, and for all practical purposes was besieged in Hofuf. Iba Kashid, oblivious of the agreement recently signed, seized the opportunity to raid the Qasim, but his advance was easily stopped, and the arrival of a force from Kuwait under the Shaikh's son, Salim, turned the balance in- the Hasa. The 'Ajman were routed in September, harried on their retreat northwards by the Bani Khalid and forced to toke refuge in Kuwait territory, where they remained until Shaikh Mubarak's death in December. Fahad ibn Sa'ud was killed in the retreat : Salman made his peace with ibn Sa'ud at the end of the year. During the struggle we had facilitated the despatch of ammunition to ibn Sa'ud from Bahrain and done what we could to restrain Abu Dhabi : in October we presented ibn Sa'ud with 1,000 rifles and gave him a loan of £20,000. The Turks had not yet abandoned all hope of winning him over, and in July previous to ibn llashid's raid a Turkish emissary, Salih al Sharif al Hasni, communicated with him and proposed a meeting : but his request was refused, and on December 2Gth ibn Sa'ud met Sir Percy Cox at Qatif and the long delayed treaty was completed and signed. Subject to certain safeguards it provided ibn Sa'ud with a dynastic guarantee in the dominions now in his possession and promised him the support of Great Britain in case of unprovokedaggression from foreign Powers. On his side ibn Sa'ud engaged to hold no correspondeuce with any foreign Power and to grant no concessions to ioreigners, to keep open tlie roads to the Holy Places and to commit no aggressn e act on other Shaikhs under our protection. _ Ibn Sa'ud was unaware of the exceedingly confidential correspondence Tvliicn we had been carrying on with the Sharif during the winter of 1915-1910 but the results to which it led could not leave him indifferent. Relations between the Hijaz and Najd had been dictated by conflicting sentiments. Hie pnani had even mere reason than ibn Sa'ud to fear the Turks, but he was jealous of ibn Sa'ud's position as an Arab Chief, and the feeling was reciprocated in Kiyadh. The fluctuating allegiance of the tribes is a rich source of discord in Arabia, and the absence of any defined frontiers enhances the uncertainty of claims and obligations. In 1910 the Sharif 'Abdullah asseitin^ that he acted on behalf of the Ottoman Government, marched to the borders of the Qasim for the purpose of re-asserting an authority which was probably a thing of the past and must at the best have been shadowy. The tangible results of the raid do not seem to have been more than a re-insistance on the fehanf s suzerainty over the distant sections of the'Ataibah, a tribe wmcn had one® been under ibn Sa'ud but had largely seceded to the Sharif. &gt; a fTi! ^ ri ] 3u ^ e ^I ecc a from the Qasim villages was stipulated for bv Abdullah before his withdrawal, but it is unlikely that it was ever paid, xrom 1913 the Sharif showed strong anti-Turkish proclivities, and before the outbreak of war he and Ibn Sa'ud drew together. They were in correspon- d ^ ce y he n Captain Shakespear paid his first visit to Riyadh in the spring n T • o, , UaiT 1915, tJie ^ were actir] ^ iu concert, and ibn Sa'ud told L/aptam Shakespear that in his view the Khalifate would revert to the family or the Prophet, oi which the Sharif was the representative, if it dropped from the hand of the Sultan of Turkey. In November 1915,'Abdullah reappeared in JN ajd, with what object is not very clear. His own explanation was that . ie ^\as sent on a mission to ibn Sa'ud, with the further purpose of collectino 1 dues in the Qasim and Sudair. Except for a doubtful suzerainty ove^ wandering sections of the 'Ataibah, the Sharif does not seem in Beduin estimation to have rights in either province, his limits eastwards being some where between Longitude 44° and Longitude 45° at Sha'arah, Duwadmi, Jabal Dimrai and Jabal al Nir. 'Abdullah is not reported to have advanced much beyond Sha'arah : he collected dues from the 'Ataibah, subdued the small allied section of the Buraih (by origin Mutair) and returned to the Hijaz : but ibn Sa'ud, barely emerged from a perilous contest in the Hasa, not unreason ably regarced the expedition as inopportune and even suspicious. (These sentiments were reflected in his conversations with Sir Percy Cox in December. He reminded the Chief Political Officer that the Wahabis recognized no Khalif after the first four, and was careful to add that if the Sharif should assume the title it would make no difference to his status among other ruling Chiefs.) In June of the following year the Sharif rose in open rebeliion against the Turks and declared the independence of the Arabs. Ibn Sa'ud, writing in July to the Chief Political Officer, Arab Bureau, 2i)d August 1916. acknowledged the receipt from him of . official news with regard to the Hiiaz, expressed his satisfaction at the discomfiture of the Turks, but put forward his own apprehensions that the Sharif might proceed to claim authority over parts of Najd, and in support of this fear observed that in declaring the inde pendence ol ^ the Arabs the Sharif appeared to treat them as a compendious whole, an attitude which he regarded with anxiety. In August he wrote again, saying that he had now received a letter from Arab Bureau, 9th August 1916. the Sharif m 'which the latter announced . , the occupation of Mecca and asked him J or Ins help. Ibn Sa'ud gave a summary of his reply, and a copy of the original Herewith enclosed. letter 1138 sillCe b een received. He , . . . . assured the Sharif that he would render all assistance which was in his power, but asked for a written undertaking tnat the Sharif would abstain from trespassing in his territory or interfering with his subjects. Ibn Sa'ud went on to ask Sir Percy Cox whether his8 relations witli the Sharif mi^ht he regarded as a'matter which affected the two chiefs alone, or whether they touched on our interests, in. which case he would be smided by our wished. According to Arab reports received at Kuwait the' Sharif wrote three times to ihn Sa'nd asking for aid, and on t wo occasions sent him £2,000. Not improbably theie is some truth in the rumoured remittance of small sums. The Sharif's answer, dated September 5, to ibn Sa ud s letter was, to say the least of it, unconciliatory and aroused Herewith forwarded to Arab Bureau. indignation. His letter and the draft undertaking which had been sent with it for the Sharif's acceptance were sent back with the observation that ibn Sa'ud's request could emanate only from a man bereft of reason. About the same time ibn Sa'ud received a letter from 'Ali Haidar acquainting him with his appointment as bhzvit m place of Husain by the Ottoman GovernmeDt, and calling on him to join the 1 Jihad, but in his reply ibn Sa'ud express- Arab Bureau, uth October me. tlie resentmen t felt by the Arabs towards him and towards the Turks. The Chief Political Officer dealt at length with the Hijaz question in a letter to ibn Sa'ud dated October 19th. Arab Bureau. 24th October 1916. ^ pointed Out llOW important it Was to the Aral) cause, which it was the policy of the British Government to support^ that all the great Arab chiefs should work together and in co-operation with us in the common task of expelling the Turks from Arabia As to ibn Sa. ud s own position he need have no misgivings for he had been acknowledged by us to be an independent ruler and the Sharif must recognize the full import of the treaty. The British Government had no reason to believe that he enter tained any hostile intentions against the tribes aud territories of ^sajd. In the negotiation over the treaty in December 1915, Sir Percy Cox had discussed with ibn Sa'ud the possibility of his giving us assistance against ibu Rashid. The Hakim of Najd then thought that ibn Rashid would either come . in or maintain astrict neutiality, if however he showed himself acti\ cly hoscile, ibn Sa'ud would attack him and incite the northern 'Anazah against him. This intention however he failed to carry out. During the spring and summer of 1916 he was occupied with a rebellion of the Murrah, following on, ami perhaps connected w^h, that of the 'Ajman, which endangered his communications with the Hasa. Though a large proportion of the lighting men of the Shammar had gone north with ibn Rashid against the 'Iraq, no effective attack was made on Hail in their absence. In late June or early July, ibn Sa ud s son, lurki, raided Jabal Shammar, and the news may have hastened Ibn Rashid's retreat from our frontiers. In September or October Turki renewed hostilities against some of the Shammar Shaikhs and an allied section of the Harb, but the affair resulted only in the capture of a small amount of booty, and ibn Sa'ud s doctor, passing through Bahrain, brought a message to the effect that the Amir could do nothing against the Shammar as long as the fugitive 'Ajman remained on his flank. The true reason for his inactivity was no doubt his own insecurity at home, but the implacable hostility w hich he entertained towards the 'Ajman, whom he regarded not only as rebels but as the murderers of his brother Sa ud, threatened to become a problem, of some difficulty. When Shaikh Mubarak died in December 1915, ibn Sa'ud pressed his son and successor in Kuwait, Jabir, to drive out the 'Ajman Shaikhs. Jabir made a temperate reply. He was unwilling to eject the 'Ajman, fearing that they would be thrown into the enemy camp ; but he could not hold out against ibn Sa'ud's insistance without creating an open breach and he expelled the tribe in • February 1916. As he anticipated, they turned for protection first to Ajaimi and then to ibn Rashid, but in May they asked and obtained permission irom the Shaikh of Zubair to settle quietly near Safwan and subsequently several of the leading Shaikhs made submission to us. When ibn Rashid returned to Hail only two of the 'Ajman Shaikhs remained with Ajairni and they had little or no following. Ibn ba'ud's ardent desire to direct his energies upon the extermination of this tribe was not one with which we had any sympathy, at all events at the present juncture.9 jf s f Shaikh Jabir, new to his office, could not hope to exercise the inflaence over ibn Sa'ud uhich had been possessed by that practised and weighty diplomatist his father : moreover for some years before Mubarak's death relations between Riyadh and Kuwait had been growing cooler. Ibn Sa'ud bitterly reseated Mubarak's attitude during the negotiations between himself and the Ottoman Government in the spring of 1914. According to his account the Shaikh had at lirst counselled him to accept the Turkish offers, hut when he readied Kuwait in April Mubarak changed his note, without explanation, and advised ibri Sa'ud not to come to terms with the Turks, refusing, at the same time, to be present at his meeting with the delegates. So indignant was the Amir that he expressly stipulated with Captain Shakespear that Mubarak should not be con sulted in the negotiations with ourselves. The asylum given to the 'Ajman was Arab Bureau, 8th April 1916. another grievance, and in 1916 ibn Sa'ud i complained of the incidence of the transit dues which had been, from time immemorial, levied in Kuwait. AV hile ibn Sa'ud's anxiety as to the ambitions of the Sharif, and his i?rowin2r estrangement with Kuwait showed that the chiefs ailied with ourselves had not reached a satisfactory understanding with each other, there was evidence that the Turks were still active in Arabia, News was received from ibn Sa'ud and from other sources of the despatch of an agent (Muhammad) Taufiq ibn Eara'un of Damascus, for the purpose of buying camels for the Ottoman Government; the emissary was well chosen, for he was a personal friend of ibn Sa'ud and had visited Najd on the same business the previous year. But on this occasion Arab Bureau, I9tL September 1918. J 1 .' 6 ^ mir ^ P r . CSSed ^ , US t t0 Prevent mm Jrom obtaining camels: he accord ingly arrested ibn Fara'un, confiscated 700 camels which had been purchased in the interior and sent them to Kuwait. Various reports, some of which i k u-n v . , came from ibn Sa'ud, indicated that Arab Eurean, herewith enclosed. - . ' _ . . _ another attempt to stir up ibn iiashid against us was in the wind. Rushaid ibn Lailah, ibn Eashid's representative % at ConstaLtinople, joined him at Hail with a few German and Turkish officers, a small body of Turkish soldiers and some guns; accounts varied as to the exact composition of the mission, but its presence in Hail in some form seemed fairly certain. Ibn Sa'ud had written in September that he would be glad of a personal interview with the Chief Political Officer to discuss the question of co-operation with the Sharif or offensive action against ibn Rashid. In October he repeated the request urgently, and on all grounds it seemed advisable to accede to it. Sir Percy Cox met him at Ojair on November 11. Ibn Sa'ud explained to him his position in detail. He had lost considerably, in men and material, in the fight with ibn Hashidin January 1915. Since then he had been almost continuously in the field, first against the 'Ajman and then against the Murrah. Most of the normal trade of Najd was with Syria, and the tribes were accustomed to sell their camels to Damascene dealers: the strict blockade imposed by ibn Sa'ud—the seizure of ibn Fara'un's camels bore witness to its reality—grew more and more galling : the Najdis grumbled, the tribes were restless, all asked wherein lay the alvantasre to themselven of their Chief's attitude, and it was increasingly difficult for him to keep them in hand. With, regard to the Sharif, Sir Percy Cox was able to give ibn Sa'ud the fullest reassurance. Our treaty with the Amir had been communicated to Mecca, j and wdien the Sharif announced to us his intention of proclaiming himself king of the Arabs on November 5, we had insisted on a formal admission that he claimed no jurisdiction over independent rulers. The news of the coronation at Mecca, had not yet reached Central Arabia and w T as not discussed. During conversation with the Chief Political Officer at Basrah ibn Sa'ud made a passing remark about the Sharif's calling himself Sultan but his mind seemed to be set completely at rest on hearing that his rights were safeguarded by us and that the Sharif had explicitly denied any design on the independence of himself or his compeers. Ibn Sa'ud having expressed to the Chief Political Officer at their meeting at Ojair his inclination to pay a brief visit to Shaikh Jabir of Kuwait before returning home, the project was cordially encouraged as appearing eminently10 expedient, and Sir Percy Cox rGCommended that he should be presented 'vutb. the K.C.I.E. at a majlis 'which 'was to be held at Kuwait where the Shaikh ^as to be invested 'with the C.S.I. hen he intimated to ibn Sa ud fhat this honour was to be accorded to him, tho Chief Political Officer was authorised to inform at the same time that his rights had been carelully reserved m all dealin£rs which the British Government had held with the^ Sharif, and ibn Sa'ud in his reply said that he was Arab Bureau, herewith forwarded. entirely satisfied on this point. The majlis took place on November 2Cth. The Shaikh of Muhammerah had come to Kuwait for the occasion and many Beduin were present, including the friendly headmen of the Shammar Aslam, and Dhatir, and Shaikhs of the Mutair. The Chief Political Officer, in presentiug the decorations, alluded to our satisfaction in feeling that the great Arab chiefs were bent with us upon a common purpose. The Shaikh of Muhammerah followed him with words which were warmly pro-British, and ibn Sa'ud struck the key-note of the meeting in a speech which was as spontaneous as it was unexpected. lie said that the Turks had placed themselves outside the pale of Islam by the iniquities which they had committed on other Moslems. He contrasted their policy with that of Great Britain, pointing out that the Turks had sought to weaken the Arabs by fomenting their difference?, whereas the British Govern ment encouraged them to unite in their own interest. He praised the action • of the Sharif and urged the obligation of all true Arabs to co-operate with him in forwarding the Arab cause. When he had brought his speech to an eloquent close, the three chiefs, Kuwait, Muhammerah and ibn Sa'ud, swore together that they would work with us for the achievement of a common end. This scene made a deep impression on the local notables and on the Beduin Shaikhs present who will no doubt carry the tale far and wide. During the receptions at Kuwait, ibn Sa'ud showed in all his utterances how clearly he had grasped the principle which guides our relations with Arabia. He quoted as an example of our benevolent policy towards the Arab cause the* fact that we were ready even to promote a reconciliation between himself and ibn Eashid if the latter would abandon his attitude of hostility. The arrival of ibn Para 'un's 700 fine camels, each branded with the wasm of that well- known dealer, gave a dramatic completeness to the Kuwait gathering. From Kuwait ibn Sa'ud went to Muhammerah as the guest of Shaikh Khaz'al who co-operated most heartily in the endeavour to make ibn Sa'ud's visit profitable to him. Tho two chiefs arrived at Basrah on the evening of Ncvember 26. Early next morning the Chief Political Officer accompanied by two chief military representatives of the Army Commander present in Basrah went on board the Shaikh s launch and presented ibn Sa'ud with a sword oi honour and a message of welcome from the Army Commander. The day was spent in exhibiting to him the Base Camps and organisation and the latest machinery of warfare including the aircraft in which he took an eager interest. Dhari ibn Twalah and Humud al Suwait. Shaikhs of the Shammar Aslam and the Dhafir, were present, while Shaikh Ibrahim of Zubair and several Sunni notables of Basrah and refuges from Baghdad had an audience with ibn Sa'ud on the launch. The Kuwait Durbar and ibn Sa'ud's visit to Basrah have placed us in a singularly strong position. Three powerful chiefs have made public protesta tion of their friendship with each other and their confidence in the British Government. A telegram received from the Sharif, congratulating them upon their zeal in the Arab cause and regretting that he had not had time to send a representative to Kuwait, confirmed the identity of his aims with their own, and in a further message he apologized for any deficiencies in his previous letters, on the ground that while he was in the throes of war he might un intentionally fall short as a correspondent. The dream of Arab unity which engaged the imagination Of the Liberals of Damascus during the year before the war, has been brought nearer fulfilment than dreams are wont to come, but the r61e of presiding genius has been recast. Instead of the bril liant, unscrupulous Saiyid Talib, gyrating in the blast of his own ambition, the chiefs of Eastern and Western Arabia have united at the instance of the British Government.11 Besides this knitting together of Arab leaders, the meeting at Kuwait has produced certain immediate results. In the first place the extent and nature of ibn Sa'ud's share in future hostilities with ibn Hashid, if such should occur, was agreed upon. He undertook to maintain 4,000 men under arms if ibn Hashid moved in force towards the 'Iraq he would move up parallel with him towards Zubair and join the friendly tribes and a contingent from Kuwait. He informed the friendly Shaikhs that he would support them if ibn Hashid threatened to attack them in strength. If, however, ibn Rashid should remain at Hail, ibn Sa'ud would harass and attack him as opportunity offered, using the Qasim gs a base. In view of the strain upon his resources during the last two years, he has been given 3,000 rifles with ammunition, as well as four machine guns, and granted a monthly subsidy of £5,000 to cover the expenses he will incur in maintaining his men in the field. Active co-operation with the Sharif was not considered practicable, but ibn Sa'ud was ready to send one of his sons with some 40 men to Mecca as a sign of good-will, if the Sharif would make a special request for them. Secondly, a letter was written by ibn Sa'dun, in the name of the three chiefs, to 'Ajaimi ibn Sa'dun urging upon him the harm which he was doing to the Arab cause by his present attitude, Arab Bureau, heremth enclosed. i nv iti U g him -tO enter into Communication with them and promising him friendly consideration and an opportunity for honourable submission. Finally, with the co-operation of Shaikh Jabir of Kuwait and the diplo matic skill of the Shaikh of Muhammerah who was throughout of the highest service to the Chief Political Officer the delicate problem raised by the presence of the 'Ajman among the friendly tribes reached a satisfactory solu tion. Por the period of the war a truce between ibn Sa'ud and the 'Ajman was agreed upon and instructions were drafted defining the position of the fugitive Shaikhs with respect to all tribes Arab Bureau, herewith enclosed. under Our protection. Onhis return to Basrah, Sir Percy Cox called in the 'Ajman leaders. They had been pro foundly disquieted by the advent of ibn Sa'ud thinking that it augured ill for themselves, but the principal and more courageous headmen met the Chief Political Officer at Zubair and accepted the proposed terms, in return for which they were promised a monthly allowance similar to that received by the other friendly Shaikhs of the Shamiyah. They evinced little doubt that the remaining headmen of the 'Ajman, including the two who were still with 'Ajaimi, would come in as soon as they heard of the happy issue of their own venture. Letters have been written to Pahad Beg ibn Hadhdhal informing him of the Kuwait meeting and inviting him to join the league of Arab chiefs in expelling the Turks. These have been sent through a man from Pahad Beg's tents who was in Basrah at the time of ibn Sa'ud's visit and went to see him at Muhammerah, where he received advice and instruction from Shaikh Khaz'al in full measure He was entrusted also with letters from the Sharif which have been waiting opportunity of despatch to Pahad Beg, Hachim al Muhaid, 'Ali Sulaiman of the Dulaim and others, and with presents in money to guide Fahad Beg's decision and to encourage the amicable disposition of the Shaikh of the Dahamshah, Jaza' ibn Mijlad. Communications of the same nature are on their way to ' Atiyah al Qulal of Najaf and Muhammad 'Ali Kamunah of Karbala. Enclosure No. 2.

Your Honour stated that His Britannic Majesty's Government, in their dealings with His Excellency the Sharif, were careful to reserve my rights, and that His Excellency the Sharif has no intention to interfere with my country and territories, which are confirmed as under my control since years. I am, anyhow, tranquil thanks to the presence of Great Britain, and the state of affairs between me and His Excellency the Sharif will be according to your wish, viz., that I should agree with His Excellency, though, thanks to God, my accord with him has been manifested since old times, for His Excel lency is the Father of Arabs. I am waiting to-day for your presence in the majlis which will be held by His Excellency, my dear brother. Shaikh Jabir: and I'll be honoured by your delivering to me the Eminent Order. Our meeting with our brothers. Shaikh Khaza'al Khan and Shaikh Jabir, is one of the greatest fortunes and pleasures though, thanks to God, we see one soul: and you will, inshallah, see all what will please you in our eternal union In conclusion, I offer best wishes for your Honour, toorether with mv heartfelt thanks. ^ May you be preserved.

On these conditions the Dhafir tribe, and those of ibn Tawala, and the 'Ajman tribe, should adopt a united attitude and should abandon differences existing between them with a view to earning the satisfaction of the British Government. 2. The 'Ajman are not to raid the inhabitants of al A arid, either townsmen or nomads, and similarly the people of Aarid are not to raid the'Ajman. 3. The 'Aiman shall not raid the Arabs dwelling in the Nigrah {i.e., from Kuwait to al Hussa) with the exception of the tribe of Umtair nor shall the said tribes raid them (the 'Ajman).21 4.

Outgoing and incoming carayans of Kajd, which carry away merchan dise from Kuwait to all towns of Najd shall not be molested. 6. Should any of the 'Ajman who are with 'Ajaimi start raiding, the friendly 'Ajman shall not allow them to come near them nor help tliem in any way and shall not mix with them and none of them shall join the raiding parties of the friendly 'Ajman, except those who may come oyer to Irsc 'with the latter and become part of them. 7. The tribe of Umtair, both those who are located at their own camping places and those who go on raids from those places are not prohibited from raiding the 'Ajman and vice versa. 8. Should the 'Ajman seize any of the Umtair trade carayans exporting goods from Kuwait, they must restore the same completely and if Umtair seize 'Ajman's carayans they must likewise make restoration. 9. None of the friendly 'Ajman shall send any of the goods which they get from Khamisiyah, Zobeir and Kuwait to the 'Ajman who are with Ajaimi. 10. They shall not be friends with enemies of the British Goyernment, such as Ajaimi and the Shammar Aabdah, but shall raid them. 11.

I feel greatly fayoured by fortune at haying the honour on behalf of His Majesty the King-Emperor'and His Excellency the Viceroy, to inyest Your Excellency Shaikh Jaber with the Companionship of the Star of India and Your Excellency Ibn Sa'ud with that of the Knighthood of the Indian Empire. I haye been commanded when deliyeiing to each of you these decorations in their behalf to express to you at the same time the appreciation of His Majesty's Goyernment of the cc-operation and accord which we haye received from your Honours since the beginning of the war. It is a great satisfaction to His Majesty's Government to know from me that you Shaikh Jaber haye the firm intention of following in the wise footsteps ot your distinguished father whose statesmanshrp and length of view made him famous among the Chiefs of the Arab States—while as regards your Honour, al Amir, it has been a matter of much gratification to them to know that the relations between Your Excel lency's family baye been confirmed and cemented. It is my good tortune to find our tried friend Shaikh Khaza'al here at Kuwait, than whom no one has deserved better y)f the British Goyernment, and it is a source of great satisfac tion to be able to feel that at this time we are all bent on one common purpose, to which we are quite confident of a successful issue. I beg to offer you my congratulation on your decoration and hope I may be spared to see you win further distinction. S. G. P. I., Delhi- No. 801 F. &amp; P.

And similarly bin Sa'ud will protect my adherents and I, bin Eashid, will not interfere with bin Sa'ud at all. Kor shall! act treacherously ^ith him vis-a-vis the Turkish Government. It is incumbent upon me to incline with him to whichever Government is allied with him, and I have no intonlion to oppose his views.

I hereby give you, bin Sa'ud, my ^ord upon my honour and on the oath of God that there shall be no deception or treachery and i will not betray you or deceive you as regards 'what 'we ha\e mentioned abo\e. Upon this bond is the assurance and the oath of God and God is witness of what I say. SA'UD BIN ABDUL AZIZ AL EASIIID. (Seal) Enclosure No. 3. Translation of letter from Abdul-Aziz ihn Ahd-er-Hahman al-Faisal to Sir Percy Cox, dated 21st September 1916. After compliments. After paying respects and enquiring about your precious health, I beg to say, in case you enquire about me, that I am quite well, thank God, and pre serve my regard and friendship for you* And my affairs, thanks to God, are prospering. Previous to this, I sent you several letters, but have not yet received replies, may the motive be favourable. And I beg to state that in these days, my son Turki has proceeded to wards Hayel to take his revenge of them. On his way, about one day's run from Havel, he came across several parties of ibn Eashid's Arabs, who had come to him for refuge with him from the Shammar and Harb and Hatim and God helped Turki against them, and be pursued them getting from them much booty and killing a lot of their men ; I am consequently pleased to tell you this. I am awaiting the good news of your victories over the enemy, and the victories of the Great Government and her Allies. With regard to the news from the Hejaz and the fighting of the sons of the Sharif against the Turks, encounters and skirmishes have taken place between them, but I have not yet ascertained the true facts and, inshallah, I will certainly apprise you of them alter ascertaining same. And I beg to inform you with effect to 'Ajman who are located at Safwan that you are aware of their relations with me and that nothing during that time prevented me from punishing them except the hot weather ; for if we wished to march agninst them via the coast of the sea, water would have been abundant in Kuwait sides, where they had certainly confederates and spies who would have warned them, and they would have cleared off before we could reach them, moreover the distance was great. On the other hand on the inland side our towns, are barren and devoid of water. It is only now and later that we can operate when the weather is cool.13 They have in these days sent to me messengers with letters asking that I will amnesty them. But I know that they do net really aim at a truce nor will they make confidence in me, on account of their bad deeds in the past which are not hidden from you. They hope to deceive me and thus attain their purposes, and by w r asting time make off to any other place they like. More over they are ignorant, their knowledge and control being in the hands of Dhaidan and Khumsiyis, who is now w r ith bin Hashid's men and with bin Saedun. The former is their overlord and they do not act without his orders, while the latter is influencing in any way he wishes. I have, however, granted them amnesty, provided they come to the direction of Najd, and provided their Shaikhs come to me. It is probable that they will accept that. My intention is to clear them off from this direc tion, for if they remain on this side, they may cause disturbance in one of the two following ways :—Either they will be at the bidding of bin Rashid and bin Sa'adun at any time they like, or else they will certainly aggress on my tribesmen, who will then be forced to pursue themw As I have mentioned above, it is known to you that operations on this side which are in your hands will harm some of the tribes. If therefore you think it better that they should clear off from the side of Zobier and Kuwait, I should find it, too much more convenient as I depend firstly on God and secondly on you, and am acting in pursuance of your orders to me, and secondly because the harm caused by tneir remaining there will be great. Interested people or persons ignorant of the real facts may say to you : ' I am afraid that if they go they will side with bin Rashid or with bin Sa'adun, and then some hostile action on their part may ensue. As regards the possibility of their joining the said individuals they are looked upon as some of their very subjects, and it is only by the previous machinations of bin l^ashid that they have become so, may God confound them. Therefore I wished now to express to you my thoughts, and there is no doubt that you are more careful on my interests than I am myself. Also your • policy must have been well acquainted with their affairs in relation to bin Eashid. I have, to say the truth, stated too much, for which I request you to be so kind as to forgive. May the Creator keep you safe and may He protect you. (Seal.) Dated 22nd ThiUKidah 1334—21st September 1916. Note .—A solution of this question—the feud between ibn Sa'ud and the 'Ajman—was arrived at the personal meeting of bin Sa'ud with Shaikh of Kuwait and Chief Political Officer at Kuwait on November 21st, 1916. Details of terms as solution follow. P. z. COX, Chief Political Officer. 26th November 1916. Enclosure No 4. Translation of letter from Sir Khaz'al Khan^ Shaikh of Muhammerah, to Amir Abdul Aziz ibn Abd-er-Rahman al Faisal al Sa'ud, dated 19th October 1916. In the Name of God, the Compassionate and Merciful. After profound salams: This is to enquire about your august health. As regards ourselves, we are, thanks to God, quite w r ell and happy. While expectant of good new r s of your success and prosperity, we received with the hand of affection your letter, announcing your well being, and we14 were very glad to read it, and hoped for continuance of same. As regards your expressions of desire and wish for close relations, this is a proved and well known fact, more manifest than the sun at noon. May God perpetuate uninterruptedly this friendly attitude so long as days and years endure. As to your good news regarding the hostile operations conducted by your honoured son Turki against certain Arabs, and his victory over them, we thank God for this success. Inshallah, you will always be prosperous and victorious. • Further we beg to offer complete salams to your noble father, your brothers, and all your sons. Here, our son Jasib and his brothers present their deep salutations. Please continue always sending your letters, informing me of your well- being, and also keep me informed of your requirements, which will be duly carried out. This is for favour of information. Salams. 21st Dhil-JELijjah 1334, 9th Octohev 1916. Postscript. We beg, merely for the sake of information, to write to you what occurs to our mind, namely that it is acknowledged and known that our three families, i g., yours, al-Sabah's, and ours, are completely united, and are considered as one dynasty, the interests of which are all the same, for thus runs adage, 'wish for your friend what you wish for yourself'. With reference to this Power, Great Britain, their regard for Your Excellency, and their kindness to all is not hidden. Their motto being to appreciate the merits of their loyal friends. We cease not (and God is witness) to behold their friendship for you.- All representatives of this Great Government are statisfied with you, especially His Honour Sir Percy Cox, who always manifest to his satisfaction with Your Excellency. Therefore we request Your Excellency to grow more and more in your loyalty to this Government, for they appreciate their obligation to their loyal friends. Even the humblest merit does not pass unrecognised by them, and their justice is famous. Though to apprise you of such facts is a liberty on our part, we were merely by way of correspondence desirous of telling you (although ycu are well aware of the attitude of this Government and of the inner intentions of their sincere representatives) that we desire that our three families should adopt one policy, and should consider the only interest of this Great and Just Kingdom. Abdul Aziz ar-Robai will certainly apprise you of the strength and organization which he has seen to exist in Basrah, which are increasing daily. Further Postscript. As regards your previous letter, it duly reached us, and because it was in reply to our letter, that is why we were slow to answer soon. Your demand which you mentioned with effect to the 'Ajman was, by the Grace of God and according to what we heard, performed in the mode you wish, they did not dare to do anything on account of your brother. Shaikh Jabir's attitude. The union of our three families is, by God's will, becoming more com plete day by day. There exists, moreover, affection on the part pf your brother, Shaikh Jabir, towards you, even more than that of his late father though the latter was accepted as the father of all. But, truly, Shaikh Jabir desires to confirm by any means his regard for you. Inshallah you will, by and by. behold what will increase your confidence in his regard and concord. You are doubtless certain in your mind that we are exerting15 ourselves very fully in cementing the friendly relations of our three families and descendants, for we feel it is our duty and obligation to do so and your man Abdul Aziz ar Robai will certainly corroborate the regard and accord he has experienced from us. And we are pleased to learn from your brother, Shaikh Jabir, that you have a mind to proceed to the place of all, Kuwait. Please God this good news, which I was glad to receive, will take shape, so that, inshallah, we may meet you happy and in good health, and may be fortunate to see your countenance. AMIN. Enclosure No. 5. Translation of a letter from Sharif Hussain of Mecca to Abdul Aziz ihn Sa'udy 6th Zill Qoiada 1334. After compliments. Your Honour's letter of 13th Shawalhas reached me and the contents have been understood, and what you mentioned about the continuance of your good health has pleased me. But as regards your observations, they can only emanate from a man bereft of his reason or of an absent mind. But thank God we are capable of enduring more than this from persons of less amount than you, and this time it is one duty to bear it also from you. But O ! Father of Turki, if you believe in God and in the Day of Judgment it is to be denied that you should not busy yourself with what there is no cause for. You see that I am convinced that we are co-partners except in regard to what God has forbidden. This is the right and the truth and there is no mystery behind it. If you realise this and rid yourself of doubt and suspicion (which are not right on the part of people like yourself) this is what is to be * expected from the sagacity and perspicacity of persons such as you. Be it otherwise, I shall realize that God has given you up, and there is no method in His will. But the request will demoniitrate the truth. At any rate we are waiting to see how you have carried out what we communicated to you in our letter sent to you by Homaidhan, which dealt with the Asaiba and their news. This is what had to be explained and on (?) of the above it has been written. Seal of Sharif. P. S. —Your letter and its enclosure are sent by us enclosed herewith so that you may reflect in what you wrote to us in them. As regards what you desired us set forth in the enclosure, if God has dispersed your doubts there is in my opinion no need for it, while if your doubts are still being revived by the intentions of ibn Faraon and people like him, then there is no use in it, for the result in writing in that sense will be that I shall receive from you a letter asking for its cancellation, just as you have asked me now to cancel what you wrote to us in this sense, and which Nasir bin Farhun brought to us under your confirmation, and which is in our hands. And God is with us and with you in good fortune. Seal of Sharif of Mecca. Enclosure No. 6. Translation of letter from ihn Saud to the Sharif of Mecca, dated 13th Shawal 1334=15th August 1916. After presenting you with profound salams, and praying for thee that God may rest on you his blessings always, and after offering our obligatory regards16 and respects to you, we beg to state that, previous to this, a letter was des patched to your honour, in which we told you what was sufficient. Your Honour (may God preserve you) knows that everything is based on its foundation, and the foundation of religion and of the world is Truth. And we (may you be preserved) in the first place deal with you and correspond about matters of which some are not true ; but it is not, please God, with any intention that there should be any estrangement between us. But we see that whereas many of our enemies and interested people are with you and you believe what they tell you and become suspicious of us, yet we are convinced that the real facts will be proved, in contrast to the gossip of enemies and people in general, which cannot endure ; and we have dealt with you in a manner which should neither displease you nor cause prejudice to you, and we will follow you for better or for worse. After the departure from here of your men bin Homaidhan and bin Twaiq, the messengers whom we had sent with bin Taroan, our intention was that they should incite the 'Ainzah against bin Rashid, returned to us. It is known to you that on their arrival in Syria, the Turkish authori' ties lavished gifts on them, particularly in camels, and gave them large presents. No doubt from information which has reached me, they have exaggerated matters and are pleased (with their experiences). But our servants have, undoubtedly, apprised us of deeds done by the Turks, at which every Moslem and Arab closes his eyes with disgust. It became established and known to me that their only aim is the annihilation of Islam and of Moslems and especially Arabs ; and it is therefore incumbent that we should resolve to be sincere to you and to co-operate with you in any case, so that, inshallah, we may attain our subject, and that God may con found our enemies. Tims we shall not be blamed and shall be concentrating our energies and shall not have cause for regret. Well, O, Sayid ! Now you are aware that even in the invocation we say* ' O my God, forgive me and my parents In the past there existed a misunderstanding between us, which w a s increased last year by brother Abdullah and by his treating our brothers wit^ 1 contumely and his abuse of our religion and our chief ship. You know tha^ the Basul (may God bless him) said, ' In the event of a calamity happening, ransom ye yourself with your possessions without sacrificing your life, and if the calamity increases then pay the ransom with your life without sacrificing your religion Now, if you (may God make you prominent) are a man desirious of our services, and if you desire us to co-operate with you, and that our forces be united, sooner or later, and that we should be, like a building, cemented with each other, these we desire you to give us a promise and your word on the lines of the paper encloBed with this letter, so that our mind may be at rest, and that we may exert ourselves, and in order that the feelings of our subjects may induce them to help us in anything we desire. By God, you should understand that we do not mean by these words any' thing more than :— (a) That God may help you and us, that we may co-operate in the question of this religion, and (ii) That we are afraid of what we have seen of the actions of the pre sent Government towards Arabs and towards the mosques, which they have turned into quarters for troops. Their only object is the destruction of Islam and Moslems. Also when we saw their activities in these expeditions, we were exasperated at it. But if our object was to attain worldly ambitions or achieve our own interests, you are aware of how others are exerting themselves. All that we17 desire we can have, but God refuses that we should prefer our worldly interests to the zeal of Moslems and Arabs, and — {Hi) That we rest assured in regard to your attitude, as we already mentioned, so that we may actually co-operate with you to our utmost power for the benefit of us all. Except on these terms, there can be no permanent understanding between us, especially regarding the question of interference with our tribes and subjects. So we request you to accept what we say and hear with it as advice and that you will perform what we ask in order that, inshallah, the purpose may be achieved and that co-operation may be afforded. This is what was necessary for your information. Please convey our salams to your noble sons. Here, our respected father, and our brothers and sons salute you. May you be preserved in safety. (Seal.)

I therefore hope that the answers are on their way to me. You have already been informed that I have detained bin Faroun in custody and seized the camels he bought for the Turks. I have also made more strict the blockade against trade, and communications generally, with the Turks everywhere in my territory. In opposition to this action of mine, the Turkish Goverment sent to bin Eashid 25 (twenty-live) German and Turkish officers accompanied by guns (cannon), arms, and other necessaries and also about 300 soldiers and bin Rashid's agent in Constantinople, Rashid bin Laila, and two days after arriving in Hail, the aforesaid Rashid proceeded with two German officers and a Turkish officer towards Iraq. Up to date I have not got information as to the movement of Bin Rashid and the soldiers mentioned above; but I am watching their movements and surely they will attempt some advance. I would also state that I would like to have a conference with you for which I have made up my mind to be in Hassa on the 10th of Muharram 1335 (7th November 1916). I request you to send an immediate answer as to whether I can have a chance of meeting you at the place you will fix and the time at which you can get leisure Or else you will let me know your opinion. According to information I have received about the movement of the troops in Medina, they have given up the idea of marching to Holy Mecca and have fortified Medina with trenches. They have also taken steps to protect ithe railway and have also kept troops in Medina for defence, and the remaining soldiers whom they wanted to send to Mecca have returned to Syria. This is all I know and only wish the permanance of your friendship and the continuance of the news of your welfare. May God preserve you.\ X &lt; Telegram.R.

Ruler of Najd, to the Hon'ble Sir Percy Cox through Captain P.G. Loch, His Britannic Majesty 's Political Agent, Bahrain. I mentioned in my previous letter which I sent you through the Political Agent Bahrain that Rashid bin Lailah proceeded to wards Medina or Al Hajar^ In these days I hav^/authentic news that when he left Ibn Rashid he was accompanied by Turkish- soldiers and was met on the way by Hataim and Bani Karb Arabs of liarrah. At a distance of 3 days from the Jabal Rashid bin Lailah came to know that the aforesaid rabs were looking out for him in order to plunder him then Rashid came out to help and that those who were with latter fled away and a few remained of the men of Hail and the Ajman and none of the tribe of Shammar was present as they got separated into 2 different parties, one of which, al Aslam has Joined me, and those who ■vere with Rashid some were the cousins of Ibn Tuwallah and the second party is of the 'Abdah who wanted to help him (Ibn I 5* Rashid) but a number of them excused themselves as they were afraid lest their property should be taken by Ibn Sa'ud. And the other Arabs of the desert who are with Ibn Rashid on hearing this took refuge at the hills Salma and Aja and when Ibn Rashid reached Ibn Lailah the abovementioned Arabs were encamped at a place called al •Alam in the direction of Harrah and when he reached the same place an action took place between bin Lailah and the Arabs and the latter made him flee away with his party and, according to my information from a man of Bani Harb who wa3 present when that fighting took place, the Turkish soldiers left their sheep and many loads^erosine oil which were bought by Ibn Lailah from the Jabal intending to carry them to iedina then the aforesaid Arabs took charge of these. Ibn R&lt;\shid after his escape from the front in the afternoon returned from the•- IS7 1/ . the battle field in a dlenrrler P.rvl on t)-e following nif^t and the next day he went to al Uifan ne''&gt; Hall. Thirty the men of Hail were killed and 20 of the soldiers, including their leader Othman Baig and I am still making full ©ncjiiries. And as regards Ibn Lailah he will find great difficulty in getting to al , ;J.ara as he is afraid of great danger if he proceeds by the usual routs as he fears meeting one of my parties which is watching all round that side and he also fears obstruct ion by Arabs being in those parts although he lias some Hataim and Beni H«.rb(rafi ^)guides.

When at 'Oqair - on July 8th-I learnt that no goods were going to Qatar from Bin Sard's territory, but, as far as I can ascertain, there is no question of aggression or active interference. Biirther report will be made if necessary. Captain, Political Agent, Bahrain. 3. P. . Captain, Political Ageut, E: ' m.i. .ni Dear Captain Loch:— Continuing our conversatioi. of last night, I may say that the trip to Riyadh is not an extremely hard one, even in Summer unless the effort is made to travel very rapidly. From Eas^a to R^adh nay be done in six or seven days in comparative comfort, and in the Spring, such a trip would be s pleasure, Mos' of the territory passed over seems utterly barren, but the strip of sandy desert or 'Dai/.a' as the Arabs call it, abounds in excellert f#rage. This serves to support nothing more than 1 housands of gazelle, but if en occassional well could be sunk in this area the number of sheep, camels etc, that could be raised would be almost un limited, I y The road from Has^a to Abu Ja^fan, and from there to Riyadh, which was the road travelled both going and returning, contains nothing v.hich suggests any mineral resources to an untrained ejre. In placos the country is somewhat rough, more particularly between Abu Jaffan, and Riyadh, but no mountains are seen, nothing indeed, more than comparatively low hills. The most complete peace and quiet reign everywhere. Unprotected caravans travel anywhere without fear, A camel-load of money (Silver), i evenue from Has^a on its way to Riyadh, accompanied our caravan of nine individuals. It was quite unescorted by soldiers, but this fact did not even excite surprise or comment, Has^a is c Comnieroial center of Central Arabia, Io*s Capital city is made up of three divisions, one of which is called the'K«-^t'or Hofi^ef, Beduins come here to sell 'Ghee' etc, and to buy dates and what other things .hey wish, in numbers that are simply tremendous. I was assured that nowhere in Arabia could they be met with in equal numbers. The local resources are lerge. Date gardens stretch for miles. There are some fifty odd (or Seventy odd) centers of population in addition to the Capital, and many of these contain several thousand population, A closer touch with the outside world would bring about a very considerable commercial development, for their principal product, namely their dales are superior in quality to anything raised elsewhere. They are disposed of to poor advantage aow, ow ' mi J -vo very or-.-o.v packing, none whatever going to Lurope, Basra's population is for v.ne mast part Shi'ah in religion the Artisans, Gardeners, etc,, belonging to that section of Islam. The Sunnis are for the most part property ow^ners, and form a sort of Aristocracy both of money and position. The place is tolerant and would welcome more contact with the outside world, especially if obviously profxfable, fihe above in regard to Has^a is based on a residence of 4 dysj and {Is of necessity in large parj gathered from conversations e ,c, rather (than from personal observation.The religioue ai d.

His military strength depends on hie success in uniting the numerous tribes and it is easy to se-: . v.- ,io j,iin ozo ip .' js n - ex f cr L ai_d attention, as this does. The members of the different Bedouin tribes visit him in great numbers , his guest houses frequently containing a thousand or fifteen hundred of them.

They are supported by the Ruler and to .join their number any one of the 'I'Sfchwan' has only to signify his desire for similar training. The society numbers many thousands in many different tribes and supports the present ruling house in P.^adh enthusiastically. Very little is heard in ordinary conversation, concerning the cresent European war. The Bedouin knows very little about - , and cares less. The city dwellers are better informed, cut t^Lej say \ i iy l_i &lt;- i because they dare not. As far as con be judged, N #j d is pro-British only because the ruler compels it. The war has had almost no direct effect upon the people. Rains in the desert, and good date crops in the cities, have made times rather better than usual. Vcdul Aziz the ruler, himself, is an Arab of v unutual e. - ciowcents. A courteous host, and a natural gentleman, he is a rulex* or great force and even severity. He has acquired a considerable knowledge of the world and shows great intelligence in his grasp of present conditions.inere is id doubt of his warm personal regard for several of the British PolaUc AgentB Wh0E he has 'ost Of all for the late Captain Shakes- ?e»r/, and for Sir Percy Cox and Captain Looh. His admiration for the Bh administration of India and the Gulf, is very great, though not unmixed witb oritioism, of certain things, particulary the character of some ^ c.iicers. The campaign in Mesopotamia has not been ou' mistakes, in his opinion, as for instance the failure to assign cue c.. ter-er to pass^ngor trads upo.i the fall of Baghdad, so that .nabs ravelling in and out might have carried the news everywhere, and so tave secured the maximum influence on Arab attitude.
