Sir, In reply to your letter No. 2261 dated the 6th October 1929, I am directed to forward a copy of a note by the Chief Controller of Stores, Indian Stores Department and to say that the Government of India are pleased to allow the Bahrain State to purchase their stores, except those specified in the attached list, through the Indian Stores Department. 2. All communications on the subject may, in future, be made direct to the Chief Controller, Indian Stores Department. I hare the honour to be, Sir, Tour most obedient servant, Sd. F.VDV/ylie, Deputy Secretary to the Government of India. Copy, together with a copy of the letter replied to is for warded to the Department of Industries and Labour for infor . mat!on.INDIAN STORES DEPART?,'BUT This Department would be prepared to purchase on behalf of the Bahrein State not only the classes of stores referred to but any other descriptionsjof stores and materials required by the State except those specified in the attached statement. It will, however, be necessary for the State to deposit in advance either in a Government of India Treasury or in a Branch of the Imperial Bank of India in thename of the Audit Officer, Indian I Stores Department, a sum of money sufficient to cover the estimated cost of the stores plus the departmental charges, which should be calculated at 3 per cent of the cost of the stores as indicated in the Department of Industries and Labour note. I should imagine that the Bahrein State will probably find it more convenient to deposit the sums in the Branch of Imperial Bank at Bombay (unless there is a Government of India treasury at Bushire) and if this course were adopted the State would have to give the Bank instructions that the money should be strictly reserved for the purpose of meeting demands fran the Audit Officer, which should be complied with by the transfer of amount to the Indian Government account. Whether the depo sit is made in a Branch of the Imperial Bank or in a Government Treasury, the Deposit or the Treasury Receipt, as the case may be, should be forwarded to this Department to enable it to proceed with the indent. 2# The most satisfactory form of contract would ordinarily be to provide for delivery at Bushire and the contracts would be based on the Indian price plus freight, insurance and other charges from the Indian port to Bushire. 3. If the Government of India accept the proposal, I will, if there is no objection, furnish the Political .Resident in the Persian Gulf direct with copies of our indent forms and full information as to the/procedure adopted in sufcmittinr? indent to the Department and as to the procedure in the matter of the submission of bills etc., together with copies of some of our raterate and running contracte which are likely to be of interest to the Bahrein State. 4. In order to be in a position to purchase uniforms for the State we should require samples, but we could offer to purchase and send them samples and prices of such articles as khaki drill, pagri cloth, serge, great coat cloth, putties, barrack blankets, socks etc. I will also deal with this matter in my letter to the Political Resident. 5* I regret the delay wtk which has occurred in the return of this file.List of 'E xc epte d” s tores .

' V*/ A A* By Order^ CapfaiHi Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.- Petition from Ali Hasan Havaldar Nc. 104 Bushire,dated 21st Shahrivar 1310(13th September 1931) to H.B.M*S Consul General, Bushire.From All Hassan Havaldar No. 104, Busfeire. Tc Consul- General, Bushire. Bate! 21st Shahrlvar 1310(13th September 1931) A.C. I respectfully beg to state that I,All Hassan,Havildar, No* 104,have rendered services for about 15 years and 14 months.I served 3 years in Iftiscat.7 years in the S.P.B- and the last 7 years in the Levy Corps of Bahrein* During the period of my services I have always fulfilled my duties per fectly and truly to the satisfaction of my superiors and have never committed any unexpected fault.I now describe how I joined and how I was dismissed from service. I was holding the rank of Havildar in the for 5 years during which period I carried cut my duties with the utmost bravery.When the 3.P.H. was disbanded I proceeded to Muscat.As I had lost my certificates which were shewing my serviecs in the S.P.B. Captain MacGarsey appointed me as Lance Naik in the Military Department.He left after six months and captain Alban succeeded him as the Scmmandant of the Military force.In view of the good services which were rendered by me and my loyalty to the prders of the Government he(Captain Alban) promoted and honoured me with the rank of Naik.I was holding that rank for 3 years after which Captain alban owing to illness left for India and was succeeded oy Subedar Path Khan.As I was energetic in my work he sent me with 117 military men and Subedar Niaz Ali Khan to Bahrein.Captain Campbell was then Commandant of Bahrein Levy Corps, he left the place after one year and was succeeded by Captain Geake.Nhen he saw tne good services which were rendered by me he promoted me to the rank of Havildar Major.After one year Captain Geake left and was succeeded by Major Daly.As a result of the case of Ismail Baluchi and Major Daly getting wounded all the Baluchis wree dismissed from service but I with 10 others were appointed for guarding and keeping order in the town. Captain Parke arrived at Bahrein and an Indian force was also brought for guarding the town.Captain Parke told me that the rank of Havildar Major was not necessary for me and that I should have the rank of Havildar only.I had to obey his erdersas he teas my superior.They then made a contract with me for 4 years on condition that I should abide by the same law which was applicaole to the Indians.As I was very attentive to my work and the Officers liked me,Sultan Ahmed Khan the Superintendent became jealous of me and began to make M- misrepresentat ions against me.He was always on the lock cut to put me into trouble.As I was reporting all his treachery and oppression to the people and was giving him advices he was inflamed with grudge and acted ins uch a way which caused Captain Parke to be displeased with me.You can hardly find anyone who may be safe from tne hands of this man. All the people would like to give evidence in the Court against him but as they are afraid that he may create some trouble for them they have kep quiet and they do not venture to say any thing .Captain Parke was annoyed with me owing to his misrepre sentations. As my contract was over I asked to him to grant me 3 months leave but he said that he would think over the matter and let me know.21 days after the expiry of my contract one daj when I had finished my military training lessens Captain Parke called me and told me that I had been discharged from that date with a fine of one months pay and that I should go cut of Bahre I asked him for what reason and what fault I had committed in the Department sc that I may be dismissed,fined and expelled from Bahrein where I have got a house property and family but he repliedthat he has heard that I was trading.I asked as to who has said sc and from whom he has found cut and whether the punishment of trading was expulsion with fine of one months pay but he said that he has received a report and that I shouldgo cut of Bahrein by tomorrow's mail steamer•I obeyed hhs orders as he was my officer and left Bahrein for Muscat without locking into the affairs of my house.I represented my case to Captain alban who said that he cannot take any action as he had no proper information but he will enquire into the matter.I have also sent a report about the actions of Sultan Ahmed Khan to Captain Barke and asked him to permit me to return to Bahrein in order tor-see to my private affairs. Having received no answer 1 was disappointed and came to Bushire sc that by your kindness I may be able to return to my place Bahrein and releive my wife from her difficulties. God knows that I do not remember that I have ever committed any fault. 1 have got a brother in law to whom owing to his property I agreed to give some pecuniary assistance sc that he may not indulge hilself in unlawful acts.No law permit the expulsion of an individual from a place where he has got „ a house and family for an unproved offence. I beg you to permit? me after instituting thorough enquiries into the matter to return to Bahrein and do some wcif O r I may be allowed to go there to collect my household effect and claims and leave the place.I hope you will not disappoint me. I attach a report about the treachery and trie way of deal ings of ^ultan /dimed Khan the Superintendent witn the people for your information. Information which I have got about the treachery of Sultan Ahmad Khan the Superintendent. fc. About 4 years ago I kept a sum of Rs 200/- in deposit with Sultan Ahmad Khan.After that period when I asked him to return the money to me he put me off by promises and then asks me to leave it for him. I did not agree whereupon he started shewing enmity to me and began giving false reports against me to Captain Barke.I have got a receipt inmy possession for that amount which is written by his own handwriting and all the Military units are aware about this affair. 2. He has take ds. 170 from lavildar Hadir Khan and is. 150- from Havildar Bayel Khan in the same manner as he has taken from me. 3. He has taken Rs. 150- frcmSher Raman tailor of the department who demanded the amount on several occasions from him but he refused to refund it.He has also taken Rs 300/- frem Antccn Khan sepoy who cut of fear has kept (juiet. 4. He has received Rs 200/- from the sepoy Saitad Abel to promote him to the rank of Lnace Naik. 5. A Hindu of Be Dai arrived from BcmDay without a passport but produced a false cne.bultan Ahmad Khan took from him Rs. 60/- in order to get anctner passport for him from the -^sst. to the Political Agent and concealed the false one. 6. He is by force taking money from all shopkeepers, gamblers,liquor distillers opium sellers and others. I mean to say that he is taking a certain amount of money from them regularly every month. He is also taking money from the prisoners. Per instance he has taken Rs. 500/- from Ali bin Ay, Ayad Arab goldsmith and has promised to release ^ira.Ehe people of the fort are aware about this. 7. Hechas taken Rs.200/- from Ali bin 3a'ad Arab Rs20/- frem Yusuf bin Sharaf and 300 /t from Reza Khan Kaseruni. lam r-^ady .tc prove these facts. Aziz Ahmed his brother in law who is the clerk of Depart ment is al ways dealing in carpet in the fort although he is an employee of the Bepartment.ue sells his goods tc the staff by force.He sold an old 'gillimf the cost a?f which was Rs.l0/-cnly tc Ismail bin Muhammad Sistani for Rs.2o/- and re covered the money by ferae from him. His own gramophone which- / he had hcught for Rs. 40/- sold it hy force to Jahar hin Saad Sudani for Rs. 9o/-.Afterwards he took back the sane gramophone plus Rs 35/- from him and sold it again to X Mansur hin Muhanna the policeman for Rs. 95/. He sold another gramophone hy force to Muhammad Ali Ashur Lance Naik for Rs. 85/- while its cost was Rs 45/- only. He threatened to take his rank from him if he had not agreed to purchase it. 8. I had some claims amounting to Rs.144/- against varuas persons.He forced me to sell that amount to him for Rs. 100. on the ground th4t I was not able to recover them, -ae has ah also taken 3 carpets to the value of Rs. 95 from my brother and until now he has now paid for them.He has bought a boat in partnership with Sheikh Abdullah Baba Sa^im for diving. He ordered me to purchase provisions for the crew of the best I bought the stuffs from the shop of Yusuf Shamli Arab for Rs.80/12- but untij. now he has not paid the amount to me. The Nakhuda of that ocat is Mubarak bin Sultan of Laras andh the crew are 14 in number.Some of them are named Salih bin Muhammad,Ibrahim ban Hasan and Abdullah ^bdun Hebi. I am ready to prove this matter. 9. He has borrowed Rs. 1£QQ/- from Yusuf Rakhrc to pay him Rs. 50/- per mensem.A sum of Rs. 600/- is still due from him. 1 have lost Rs. 7. one carpet and one gramophone on t is account. 10. There was a sewing machine in the Department. ~e told Captain Harke that it was a cut of erddr and useless and the Captain ordered him to sell it.He instructed the shop keeper to say that it costs Rs. 25/- only while he sold it to Abdullah bin Muhammad baker for Rs. 80/* He credited to the G-cvernment Rs. 25/- only and swallowed the balance him self. 11. He took the office typewriter to his house on the ex cuse that it was cut of order and credited Rs. 25/- cna cccut of its cost to office only while its cost was Rs 100/- 12. Some of his Indian relatives arrived at Bahrein.He was supplying them with the Levy ration without the knowledge of the Captain. in conclusion i beg to state that I am prepared to prove one by one all the statements which I have made above. Such being the case di I deserve punishment or Sultan xihmad Khan and whether I or he was doing business.His enmity to me was due to the fact that I had all these informations about him.I now leave the matter to ycut justice and eguity.lt is not just that after seven years service I should be made homeless and expelled from my place where I have got a family I hope that you will bestow your favours upon me.D.O.

I, A**-' —'' /.V3 Please refer to your office endorsement ifo. 1098 dated the 4th October 1931 regarding the return of Havildar Ali Hassan. fhe Havildar who is now in Hushire wishes to return to, and take up his residence in, Bahrein where according to his own story he had lived for the last ten years or so. His record in the levies and police with the exception of the last few months of his service would appear excellent, in his discharge certificate he is given a good character and it is stated that he was dismissed because he was trading against orders. jj*or this irregularity he has now been punished, and there would, therefore, seem to be no valid reason for denying him his request. Hut since the Superintendent of Police is against his return, major Fowle has decided to keep him here until he receives your report. xhe ma^s wife is in Bahrein and he says he owns pro^jerty there. Moreover, he was 1 believe, asked to leave at very short notice - so prima facie it would appear essential that he should be allowed to return, if not for good, at any rate for a limited period to arrange his affairs. in the meantime he is here without funds and we are / ^*^»&lt;***y having to maintain him at our expense. Major xowle would accordingly be glad 6f a reply by telegram stating whether he may return. Captain C. G. Prior, I.A., c/o Lloyds Hank Ltd., Karachi. H/TO- The Agency, Bahrain, 22nd October, 1931. Dear Parke, I enclose a copy of a D«0* from Bradshaw regarding Havildar Ali Hassan. Would there be any objection to his returning for a limited period to settle up his affairs? I dont know what his affairs consist of and as a policeman he should have had none that could not be settled up in a day or tv/o! comes in or he may say he cant find the money and so be unable to move. He had better deposit his fare to 1 uscat before he I would be glad of an early reply. Yours sincerely, Captain L.3.1arke Adviser, Bahrain Government Bahrain#Telegram Code. Political, Bahrain.

As ypu probably kjtow, whem the Bahrain Levy Corps was founded the Muscat Levy Corps were asked for a draft to start it. .They not unnaturally detailed the men for whom they had least use and a fine detachment of blackguards was sent to Bahrain. 3. They were found to be unsatisfactory and I need only say tnat on two separate occasions they murdered their officers and/or N.C.Os to show that they had serious drawbacks. After the second incident, wnen an Inuian Officer was killed and others including Major Laly wounaed, it was decided to disoand them and send them all home. All knew they were not to return, and any wno are found to have returned are sent away again atonce. As a community I have found the Muscati Baluchis only slightly less trouDlesome than the Somalis. 4. The Commandant does not desire to make an exceptioi for this man, for apart from the general objection to ail the ranks of this troublesome Corps, he gave troubli latterly, ana since he is a Muscati he has no ciaim to remain here. He had no business to enter into such affairs here as would require lengthy settlement and the fortnight he has now been given will be ample. Since, however, the State h*s already once given him his fare and also a ticket for his wife, he must deposit the price of his onward journey to Muscat either with ygu or on arrival, for the State cannot be expected to pay twice and I shall be unable to assist him.

Will you please,therefore,apply to me stating iriiat is required (addressing your letter to me at Bushire) and I will there take Up the matter with the Hon'ble the political Resident so that sanction may be given at an early date. I have arranged with the Ist/lOth Baluch Regiment for their training but for various reasons it will be better if the men commence their work about the 15th February. If this will suit your purpose you will,no* doubt,send an application as suggested. 3. It might be possible to obtain Arabic speaking Instructors from the Iraq Army though it may be difficult to ensure that the men are of the right stamp.

Please refer to your request to iJaan Bahadur -*bdul Haiy to be supplied with Instructors for the Bahrain ^riiied Police. 2. I visited the Records Oxficer of the 10th Baluch Regiment and asked him to maKe enquiries for me. Although they had numbers of men on their books it transpired that a great majority of these men were at a distance and con sequently an interview would be impossible without paying their fares. He was able,however,to select three men for me who had either just taken their discluirge or were able to take it especially to come to Bahrain. Of these I selected Havildar Abdul Kerim and - ance Kaik Abdul Rahman, both of whom have examplary characters and a very good record as Instructors. The Havildar unfortunately knows no Arabic, Persian or English but is an experienced and reliable man and,will,I feel sure,be as suitable as the men who have hitherto been employed. Ihe ance Kaik spgaks and to some extent writes English and has some knowledge of Persian. I did not think the State cou-d do better than this at short notice and have every confidence in these two. The third man who was offered me,also a ance Naik,was a fully trained Signaller but had no certificates for,or recent experience of training men,other than in signalling. It did not a^ ear to me that you are likely in the near future to require men for signalling and since he aiso knew no languages other than Urdu and Pushtu,! saw no object in engaging him. 3. I send for your record the «,riginax copy of theinstruction! sent ae by you. I hare oaitted any reference to leave for in view of the short period of their engafeaent,it appeared hardly necessary. It is possible that at first some friction aay occur between the new aen and those who are going but I trust this will not occur. As I observed before»both aen have exeaplary characters and&gt;so far as can be foreseen, should prove reliable and well conducted. 1 4.

M’s Political Agent, Bahrain. Sir &gt; I have the honour to refer to your .No. K/31 dated 1st October 1932, and to inform you that since the departure of the Commandant of Police, I have been carrying out the duties of Police Officer and have had more opportunity of becoming acquainted with the condition of the Police Porce. 1 consider that the local men who were in the force before, and the men recently enlisted, who together number almost a hundred, will prove good material for an efficient and capable police force, provided that they can be properly trained. Unfortunately 1 find that the Arab N.C.Os themselves suffer severely from lack of training, and the two Indian Havildars, who have been retained for the time being, seem during their seven or eight years in Bahrain to have forgotten a great deal of their previous training. Two N.C.Os from the Baluchi regiment have been posted temporarily for duty as instructors and I feel sure that their service will be of very great assistance as they are thoroughly up to date in their experience and methods.- 2 - In addition to this arrangement I should like to send, if possible,three or four of the Arab Police, picked men, N.C.Os or other ranics, to an Indian Army regiment for six or nine months training so that they could get a good grounding in drill and discipline and learn something of the modern methods of training recruits. The exnerience of the regimental routine and the interior working of a battalion would also be very valuable to them. I understand that the ordinary recruits T training course lasts for nine months and I think that this would be most suitable course for them to take as it covers all the requirements of the Bahrain Police. Training in signalling or special P.T. or bayonet fighting courses etc. are not required by them; but in any case in the matter of their training I should be guided entirely by the advice of the Commanding Officer. As regards pay, rations etc: The men will receive their pay as usual from here, if the rations supplied to the Indian Troops are unsuitable for Arabs, I could pay them an allowance in lieu of rations; they would be supplied with uniforms from here unless it was desired that they should wear the uniform of the Unit to which they are attached in which case the Government would pay for uniforms, and in any case all necessary payments in-curred on behalf of the men would be paid by the State.If this arrangement can be made I should like the men to start their training as soon as possible as the need for trained men here is very urgent, but if the middle of February is more suitable, I will of course wait until then. If in the opinion of the authorities it would be possible for them obtain A a fairly thorough training in six months it would suit me better than letting them go for nine months. 1 should like to know whether in your opinion it is abso_utely essential for the men to know Hindustani. Some of the men who I am considering as candidates for the course have no knowledge of Hindustani, this applies to most of the men born and bred in Bahrain, the foreigners, Persians and others, are acquainted with Hindustani, but 1 should prefer if possible to train up the really local men, Arabs and Bahama. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your Obedient Servant, Adviser to the Government.* J nf 1C Office of the Political Agent 9 Bahrain* Camp, Bu&amp;hire, Bated the 26th October 1932* From - to The Political Agent 9 Bahrain, at Buehire* The Secretary to the Hon* tie the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushlre* Sir, i have the honour to state that during my recent Tisit to Karachi, the Bahrain Gorernjnent expressed a wish to send three or feur men of the State* s police force to India for training in Indian units* After discovering that both units of the Baluch Regiment in Karachi were willing to accept such men, I approached the General Officer Commanding, Sind Independ ent Brigade Area, who, however, informed me that he had no authority for the training of military personnel of countries situated outside the boundaries of India and advised me to take up the matter through the Government of India* 2* The Bahrain Government have now formally applied to be allowed to send three or four picked men, A* C. 0 # s, or other ranks to an Indian unit for six to nine months* training and wish to be allowed to do so as early as possible* The Adviser, who is at present carrying out the duties of Commandant of Police, considers that the local men show promise, but that there are none among them who have sufficient training or experience to act as instructors, and it is proposed to utili the • • a a • a a •)ll* © - 2 - tne men who are to be trained in India for this purpose upon their return. 3. The Adriser states that he understands that the ordinary recrultB , training which lasts for nine months will be the most suitable course for them to take as it corers all the requirements of the Bahrain polices training in signalling or special physical training or bayonet fighting courses are not required by them 9 but in the matter of training the State will be guided entirely by the adrice of the Commanding Officer of the unit to which the men are attached. .Vhat the State is aiming at is roughly the standard of training which obtains in armed police in India. 4. The State will meet all charges in connection with the men and would either proYide them with ration allowance or obtain rations on payment for them by regimental arrangement. They will be supplied with uniforms from Bahrain 9 unless for any reason it is desired that they should wear the uniform of the unit to which they are attached 9 in which case the Bahrain Gorernment would pay for such uniforms 9 and in fact 9 as I hare said aboYe 9 all ' necessary {ayments incurred on behalf of the men would be re funded by the State. 5. I request, therefore, that you will be good enough to inform the Hon'ble the Political Resident of the Bahrain Govern ment's desire and request him to forward it to the Government of India as early as possible. It is preferred that the men should be sent to Karachi for training as the units there are willing to receive them, and their travelling expenses will be reduced by going to the nearest station in India. I would be glad there fore if the General Officer Commanding, Sind Independent Brigade Area, could be approached as early as possible so that the menmay be sent for training with the least possible delay* i hare the honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient servant. O i c Political Agent, Capt•, Bahrain*Novr. 9th, 1932.

I should like^o one more Naik and 8 sepoys, pro-C's. P. P.—L (m) i ioi—500-11-31. No. HKtir OF I93i-— Political Agency, Bahrein, Dated the 9 th November *932r From THE POLITICAL AGENT, BAHREIN. To The Officer Commanaing, loth h&amp;ttn lOth Baluch He giment f Karachi * I xi^ve the honour to say that the Bahrain Government c-re dismissing their remaining Indian sepoys ana wish to engage a few more on short term contract similar to that recently offeree to two men from the naluch Regiment. I su gtstea that these men coula be- auvantageously be supplied by you and Inal you would guarantee that the men sent were of good character, itfelt sure that you woula be willing to arrange for these men as I unuerstana that you are constantly approacheu by ex Baluchi sepoys with requests for employment. xhe State now require one Naik as an Instructor and 3 sepoys,aj.l on a six months agreement. The Walk will probably be retained for a longer perioa if he is founu to be suitable ana tne sepoys are simply required to stiffen up tne present bouy of local police ana to perform fjuard auties etc., Only expert men should be sent and,needless to say,men of exemplary character who are not likely to give trouble in any way. The men snould all hare been recently actively eraployea. The State is offering the following terras (iv/. rree uniJorm. (Tuey must be preparea to wear (i)• J• Kaik Rs.40 p.ra. Sepoys ns• p.m. (ii)• Rree rations ana tree quarters. ;iii;. ^ree deck passage to ana from Bahrain on commencement ana expiry of service.Arab a^al ana ehafli/a if requirea,but tnis is unlikely). It would be advantageous if the Naik could speak English or Arabic or n ersian,preierably one of the for.ner ana a general all round Instructor is what is required. Upon arrival I will undertake that each man is given an agreement on these lines and I will send to you by the next air mail blank forms which can be utilized to sen&lt;ii the men to Banrain without the necessity of supplying them with passports. The men may be given an aavance of a month T s pay which I will enaeavour to arrange to senu to you by the next air mail. Their fares can be debited to the British India ^team Navigation Company^ Agents in Bahrain and I will arrange by the next air mail for this to be aone,informing you simultaneously of the steps taken. It would be appreciated if the men coula be sent as soon as possible after the receipt of the advance of pay nejU- akr mail. If sufficient men are not available at the moment,there would be no objection to their following a week or two later,if you consider this to be in the interests of the State. :ou will notice that I am unable to guarantee more than six months employment for either the Naik or the sepoys but it is piaabahle that their agreements will be extended, ht any rate in the case of the Naik,if they appear suitable. Havildar Abdul lerim ana Lance Naik Abaul Rahman have maae an excellent impression and are working very well. I have the honour to be1 \ eat h m L.O.No: Political Agency, Bahrain,tne 12th Boventer 1C Lear Belgrave, I wrote by last air mail to the 10th Battalion of the Beluch 1 •eminent to look out for a naik ana eijht sepoys for you on the same terms as those already engaged.

This will obviate the necessity of remitting money for the tickets. I am sending forms which they can use as Certificates of , /i— Identity to come here^ so that there will be no expense 0 $ account of passports. I have told the Officer Commending that if they can't find suitable men immediately,some might follow, a week or two Ip ter, if they found men v/ho were really suitable. The men's agreements will,ofcourse,start from the day they leave harachi. I will send a sample agreement to them so that tney A know what they are in for. I will ask that they should not bring their families at present as this will involve extra lexpense. If you aeciae to keep any ol me nen i'or a loiter period,you could,ofcourse,let them go back and bring up their lamilies.
