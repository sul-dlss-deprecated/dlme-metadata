(Dear Mr. Squire) Please refer to Major Hay f s Demi-official letter No: F.655-F/39 dated the 22nd November 1939 and your telegram No: 277 received yesterday. 2. The tribes inhabiting the area adjacent to tne Chaghai Political Agency are, (as sno«n in the accompanying sketch map,) as follows:- Naruis, Ismailzais, Bekis, Yarmohamedzais, and Grumshadzais • Numerically and from the size of territory which they cover, tiie Ismailzais and the Rekis are the most important, while tne Yarmohamedzais, who under Jiand Khan fought against the British in the Great war, are the weaKe^t. During the last war the Naruis, under their late Sardar Ali Shah Khan of Nasratabad aipi, came under German influence, ana it is possible that if foreign agents could a^ain get in touch with this tribe they mi^it utilise them to disseminate propaganda in British territory, in watch case Narui tribesmen would possibly pass irom Sistan Uirou&amp;n Afghan territory into the Ghaghai Agency. Or possibly Naruis, or other tribesmen, residing in Afghan territory mi^ht ue so employed. In this connection it is interesting to recall thut botii tiie tribesmen who were recently found in posses sion of Rouble and Reich Mark notes were residents of Naa- i-Ali which is situated in Afghan territory close to the Sistan Afghan frontier. Both men belonged to the Gurgich tribe whose territory adjoins that of the Naruis. G.F.Sduire Esquire, I.C.S.. His Britannic Majesty s for Khorasan, Consul General L e she d.WvI xiH a in x 3# Tne present figi-tin^ strength of the tribes, is difficult to assess, because tnou^h trie Iranian Govern ment has undoubtedly collected large quantities of arms, many of those surrendered were antiquated and would nave been no real use for fightir^,. However the measures taken by the Iranian Government to control tne tribes during trie past few years have undoubtedly met with a certain amount of success. The tribes have been at least partial ly ais-armed* and tne Yarmohamedzais, (referred to in the first paragraph,) have officially surrendered to the Iranian Government and given up their arms. Moreover any prominent tribal leaders have been driven into exile or permanently transferred elsewhere. Juma Khan lamailzai is, of course, at present in British Baluchistan, while Idu Khan, Siraar of tne Rekis, has been w settled' at Shiraz and the good conduct of Habibuilah Khan Reki is ensured by his employment as a Lieutenant in the Iranian irmy. In fact it seems very doubtful whether there is any tribal Sirdar north of Iranshanr with suffi cient prestige to form a rallying point for any concerted action by the tribes. The policy of the Iranian Government in using certain tribes to disarm others has made any sort of combined action even more unlikely.. Hot only have the Ismailzais a blood feud with the Karuis, but they owe the Rekis a lasting grudge for the help the latter gave to the Iranian authorities at the time of the attack on Juma Khan in November 1938. 4. So far, the present war has not had any un settling effect on the tribes. But if Russia were to invade Iran or even jlf^ianistan, or if, as a result, for instance of the death of the Shan the control over j the tribes were suddenily to be relaxed, tnere would, I think, be trouble in this area. In such crisis it is possible that the Ismailzais might attacK either or both their old enemies the Naruis and the Rekis, while the tribesmen all over this locality would undoubtedlyundoubtedly consider it an occasion to be turned to gain by enlarging trie scope arid area of their raids. But for the reasons which I have already given, it seems unlikely that the tribes would be in a position even if they wished to taXe any organised action such as would threaten Britisn Baluchistan. 5. In recent months, possibly as a result of the attack on the Ismailzais ana tneir suosequent exoaus, there have been a larger number of raids in this area than usual, is you are aware, the Governor General, Colonel Mukri, rightly or wrongly believes that the raiders in many cases nave tneir head-quarters in British or Afghan territory, ana that even if not actually residing in British territory they often pass tnrougn it on tneir way to ana from their raids. In a recent interview Colonel liukri expressed to me the anxiety he felt on this suoject, especially in view of the unsettling effect which ne thougiit the war wus likely, sooner or later, to have on the tribes* 6. As far as one can see, if, at a later stage in the present war the tribal situation for any reason seriously deteriorated it would be in the direction of inter-tribal warfare in Iranian territory accompanied by a bi^, increase in individual r&amp;idi%, and possioly looting. In either case the Iranian tribesmen would be out to exploit the embarass- ments of their own Government and not of the Government of British Baluchistan. They would know that retribution would certcinly follow raids into British territory while there is nc reason to suppose that any of the tribes would choose British territory in which to fi^ht out tneir quarrels, my eventu ality that can at present be foreseen would, 1 think, be provided for by a moderate increase in the mobile forces of the Cha^iai Levy Corps. If such a mobile force were now added to the Levies already in existence it would discourage any raiders, who may be at present active (and wno invariably use camels in their raids,) from using or passing through British territory.......territory. In tiiie event of t»ne Iranicin Groverriaient losing con trol over tne tribes the presence of mooile paorols oi even moderate atren^th on the British side of the frontier would* I consider, prevent raiding parties from croobirj^, inio, «*nd sympathisers of warring factions from pas.in^ out of British into Iranian territory.

The latter class of ft activity we should of course be bound to check if necessary by force* 2. with the limited information at my disposal I am not inclined to regard (a) as a serious or imminent danger. Sven Russia's incursion into Poland seems to denote determination to snatch a part of that unhappy country from German domina tion rather than any sympathy with Germany in the major stur^le The Soviet Government have indeed declared their intention of remaining neutral in the main war and though their declara tions of policy are of course valueless as A evidence of their intentions, I can hardly believe that they would embroil themselves with Afghanistan or Iran by attempting to inave ^ India through those countries. This would seem even more un likely when they are reported to be trying to est^cii^icloser relatione with Turkey, which id the £ r 5 d i I O, 4 - m in the Saad^fabad Paot and also I belli towards us than to the Germans* 3* Aw regards (b) I find it difficult to estimate the prospects of disturbance with any degree of aocurany* Both the Afghan and Iranian GoYemments are, I should imagine, far stronger in military power and therefore better able to deal with tribal unrest than they were during the last war* Recant events in Tirah and the Astern Province may give reason to doubt the stability of the Afghan Government, but that trouble appears to have been successfully dealt with and we have had so many scares of the same kind since Nadir's accession that one begins to doubt whether the alarm expressed on these occasion at Kabul is wholly genuine. However I must leave it to you to assess the probability of trouble in Oh&amp;gai caused by unrest in Iran or Afghanistan* 4* Cole's concrete suggestion is that we should prepare ourselves for the possibility of trouble by enlisting at once a mobile reserve of the Chagpi Levy Corps consisting of two camel troops and two platoons* He rightly points out that this would be much cheaper than any other agency of defence and would to some extent relieve the economic situation among the tribesmen and thereby reduce the dagger of hostility towards Government* It would ha: of course take six months to train them, so that early enlistment is desirable, if we are to have them at all* Cole baa not given any estimate of coat but I am x obtaining this in case you think that there is ad vantage in pursuing the proposal and that there is any chance of it being sanctioned by the Government of India* My own feeling is that it is not at the moment necessary to raise this extra force for Chagai but that it would be useful insurance against trouble, if disturbances in Afghanistan or Iran are ^ all likely to take place.

In reply to ay suggestion that he should propose a less expensive ehhene, he states tint in hie opinion this is the minimum cost at which an effective strengthening of the existing Levy Corps could be secured and he point* out that, if troops are re- . quired to deal with raiding and disturbances the cost would be a great deal more* bo far as internal disturbances in the Ghagai Agency are concerned, I am confident that expenditure of this order would not be justified as a precautionary measure but as I said before I cannot with any accurajqr estimate the extent of the danger from Iran, Afghanistan or ultimately ttussia* 1 therefore pass on Gole*s estimates of cost to en able the Government of India to judge whether insurance at this rate is worth while or not.

CONFIDENTIAL. ^ Extract Prom the Annual Report on Iran for the year 1938. Military Operations. 206. The year 1938 has been one of comparative tranquillity for the Iranian Government in their dealings with the tribes. Several minor operations have, however, been carried out and the Government have at last been partially successful in subduing the Ismailzais in T ranian Baluchistan. Kurdistan. - The Kurds have been on the whole quiet. The usual petty skirmishes with both Iraqi and Kurdish bandits have taken place. Bashagird. - In January, owing to the truculent attitude of this tribe, a small punitive force of about 1,500 of all arms, under the command of Sartip (Brigadier) Siahpush, General Officer Commanding, Kerman Independent Brigade, embarked at Bandar Abbas on the Iranian sloops Babr and Shahrukh and were disembarked on the coastline near Bandar Sirik. Other small columns drawn from Kerman, Minab and Mekran co-operated in blockading the area, which is 30 to 40 miles north-east of Minab. The rebels offered little or no resistance, and the ringleaders, including Abdul Hussein Kameran, were captured, together with about 200 old but serviceable rifles. This operation is interesting, as it is the first time in which combined naval and military operations have been undertaken. The sloops, in addition to transporting the troops to the sphere of operations, were also utilised for the conveyance of supplies. Boir/Boir Ahmadi. — Isolated, but increasing acts of 'banditry were reported from this area in July, in consequence a small force was despatcned from Shiraz and Behbehan respectively to the difficult mountainous district of Shulistan. The operations were carried out efficiently and with great secrecy, all movements of troops being maae at night and along the new military roads recently constructed in that area. The tribesmen were caught between the two columns and the ringleaders captured. A small permanent garrison has now been established at lal-i- Khosrovi, which is situated in the centre,bf this troublesome area. Iranian Baluchistan. - The major success of the year has undoubtedly been the breaking up of the Ismailzai resistance in Iranian Baluchistan. Sirdar Juma Khan Ismailzai has been for years a thorn in the side of the Iranian authorities. The Mekran authorities have made repeated efforts to bring him 'to heel”, but without success. In mid-November, however, an opportunity occurred for his capture, and a mixed force of about 3,b00 troops of all arms, including Amnieh (road guards) and local Baluchi levies, were assembled at Zahidan and were moved by motor transport to near where Juma Khan was reported to be in camp. A number of troops simultaneously moved from Zabul, Khwash and Bam and completed a cordon round the a^ea. Juma Khan was taken completely by surprise, but managed to retire into the neighbouring hills, where he put up a stout resistance for over a week. Supplies, however, running short, Juma Khan was forced to evacuate his position. He escaped through the cordon without difficulty and crossed the frontier with over 100 of his followers into British territory/territory at iiran, nor$h of Zahidan, where they were disarmed and sent under escort to Nushki. 207. There is good reason to Relieve that the Ismailzais lost about fifteen killed and wounded and the military force at least sixty dead and injured. Most of these casualties occurred among the Amnieh (road guards), who bore the brunt of the attack. 208. A new Sirdar Nazar-Muhammad has been appointed and has promised to work in close co-operation with the authorities and has agreed to surrender all arms held by his tribe. 209. Juma Khan's successful retirement to British territory has brought about strained relations between the Governor of Mekran and the Divisional Commander, Bar Lashgar (Major-General) Mahmud Amini. Each alleges that the defective arrangements of the other facilitated the escape of the Ismailzai chief. 210. However, this sudden action by the military authorities, in spite of its failure to acnieve its main object, the capture of Juma Khan himself, cannot but enhance the prestige of the Government in Iranian Baluchistan and will conduce to the pacification of this long-disturbed area. 211. The Iranian authorities still appear to regard Juma Khan Ismailzai as a source of danger; even though he is far removed from the border and under surveillance, they fear that he will organise raids in Iranian Mekran and are therefore taking necessary precautions./ P.Z. 4636/59. SECRET. ^ Extract from Baluchistan Intelligence Weekly Summary No. 28 dated Quetta, the 14th July, 19 &lt;j9. BORDER AFFAIRS. 29. In paragraph 32 of Summary No. 26 it was reported that a party of about 200 Nizamis under Mahmud Khan, Reki, violated the Indo-Iranian border and demanded the surrender of Iranian refugees residing in Kalat territory and Gwadar. From information since received it appears that Mahmud Khan had with him only 30 Nizamis and 25 Amnias. He stated that he was in pursuit of a gang of robbers headed by Nawaz Khan and requested the Post Officer at Suntsar to disarm the gang and hand them over to him. As he refused to return to Iran without a written assurance that Nawaz Khan and his party would be arrested and delivered to the Iranian authorities, the Mekran Levy Corps practically encircled his camp at Saman (31 G.C/2). This show of force induced Mahmud Khan to withdraw to his own country. It appears that he originally intended to halt on his own side of the border, but on arrival there found that the only water available (The Mazar Khor - not on map) lay within British territory and he had to cross the border to camp near water. On his way back to Bahu Kalat, Mahmud Khan is reported to have been met by a senior officer who reprimanded him for entering British territor-y and relieved him of his command of the thirty Nizamis. The Nizamis proceeded to Chahbar and Mahmud Khan with the 25 Ammias went on to 9eh.23./ p. 2 . 4460/39 S^CR/JT. Extract from Baluchistan Intelligence Summary No. 27&gt; dated 7th July, 1939. TRIBAL AFFAIRS 21 . It is reported that the old feud 'between the Yarmohdzais and G-amshadzais is likely to be revived in the near future. 22. Sardar Mir Abdi Khan, who fled from Iran a short time ago and is now in G-wadar, has stated that the causes of the unrest in Iranian Mekran are : (a&gt; the disarmament campaign; (b) the attempts being made to drive Baluchis out of Mekran; (c) the steps being taken, to Vesternize Iranian Mekran, destroy all Baluch riwaj and break the purdah system: (d) the intention to do away with the term Baluch altogether and give the tribes new names as was done in the case of the Ismailzais. Mir .Abdi states that all the Sardars and other Baluch Kuhdas of Iranian Mekran have pledged themselves on oath to resist the destructive policy of the Shah. Each Sardar is said to have promised a given number of men and arms for the coming rising. Mir Abdi adds that Sardars, such as Hussain Khan, Sherkhanzai, of Geh, and Sahbi Khan of Bampusht, who are at present openly assisting the Iranian authorities, have secretly agreed to assist in any outbreak that might be planned. According to Mir xibdi, the Sardars who have subscribed to the pact to revolt against the Iranian Government can produce over 50,000 fighting men and about 9500 rifles.2. 23» Mir Isa Khan, last mentioned in paragraph 35 of Summary No. 21 , was again approached and asked to come to terms with the authorities. On the 31st May a Sarhang was sent from Bampur to Snrhaz to interview Mir Isa. The latter, accompanied by 300 followers, met the Sarhang near Sarbaz and after a long discussion, which was fruitless, returned to the hills with his following. 24* On the 13th June Iranian mounted troops, commanded by an officer, arrived at Rask ( 31 .F. 3 / 4 ) and demanded the surrender of arms held by the villagers. Tue tribesmen denied having any rifles and said that Mir Abdi Khan had taken away all the arms that the villagers possessed. The troops harassed the tribesmen and put them to much inconvenience but left withjut collecting any weapons. 25 . It will be recalled that Dehanis threatened to attack either Bakhshan or Sib if Mir ladir Dad was not released. On being informed of the Dehanis threat, the Sarvan of Bakhshan summoned the Sardars of Bampusht, Dizzak and Jalk to discuss the terms of release of Qadir Dad. The Sarvan thought that 4adir Dad should be forced to provide adequate security and promise not to attack Muhammad Shah Khan of Sib, who was responsible for his arrest. The Sardars have not yet given their opinion. Meanwhile, the Dehanis, who are at Sila-i-Koh (not on map) in the Murdan hills (31*I*A/3)&gt; are awaiting an opportunity to murder Mir Muhammad Shah and release Mir ^adir Dad. The authorities on their part are taking all precautions. 200 Nizamis have been sent to Bakhshan and 100 are reported to have arrived at Irafshan to deal with developments in the area. Mir Muhammad Shah of Sib has also incurred the hatred of others owing to the assistance/assistance he is giving the Iranian authorities Two notorious outlav/s, Taj Muhammad and Haibtan recently warned him that they would murder him. Muhammad Shah informed the authorities of the dangers to which he was exposed and asking for personal body-guard of twenty Nizamis which was provided.wmm y ^ ' s'-T' From To hjJLE COPY v J]J*r 1939 ^Ht S' * a M 4390 | c- tf: &lt;/ The Hon'ble the A^ent to the Grovernor-Greneral, Resident and Chief Commissioner in Baluchis The Secretary to the Grovemment of India, External Affairs Department, SIMLA . 7 Memorandum No: B-46/38-RFG- 431/P«Z.

A copy of this letter is being sent to the India Office and to His Majesty’s Consul General for Khorasan. I have the honour to be Your most obedient servant, JdA W.R. Hay, for Secretary to the Government of India.25./ P. Z. 3623/38. Extract from Baluchistan Intelligence Bureau Summary No. 14, dated 8th April, 1933. SECRET. BOUNDARY APPAIRS. 24. Reports received from a number of sources indicate that the Iranian Government seriously intend surveying and demarcating their eastern boundary in the near future. On about the 6th March three lorries containing a Sartip and three Hakims arrived in the Kuhak illaqa from Zahidan. They inspected the border in that area, which has already been demarcated, with the aid of maps and telescopes. Again, on the 14th/15th March some Iranian officers, accompanied by Nizamis, arrived at Koh-i-Siyahan, and are reported to have inspected the border after giving out that they were in search of oil. Further, on the 17th March two Iranian officers and ten sepoys arrived in the Kalagan area (Map 31 I.D. 3) from Sib (Map 31.1 A 4). They are reported to have crossed the border to Sorab (Map 31 I D 3 shown as Shorab) in the Kharan Illaqa a few days later. After passing the night at Sorab they returned to Kalagan, and from there to Sib. At the time of leaving, the officers stated that they would return after a week. In addition, it is reported that an Adjutant of the Iranian army flew in a military plane at a high altitude over Pilani Sunt on the morning of the 15th March. It is said that the Adjutant carried out an aerial survey of the border and dropped instructions to the Nizamis of the Pishin post. It is also reported that the new Sartip of Khwash intends visiting Gazai, Gorani, Mukso Tag, with an escort of 40 Amnias to examine the Iranian-British border.2 25. It was reported in para. 32 of Summary No. 10, dated the 11th March, that Iranian sepoys were working daily patrols to Pilani Sunt. Since the posting of Mekran levies in the vicinity the patrols have ceased. When Mekran levies were first moved to the area, Naih Durran, who was at Gwatar with 11 Nizamis, on hearing of the arrival of the levies, immediately set out for Pilani Sunt. News of his move reached Chahhar from where he received instructions not to proceed 'beyond Bahu-Kalat. Naib Curran is still there awaiting further orders. 26. The Kostag post, which was established by Iranian Nizamis, has been removed from Kandar-i-Sunt to Shah Wardi-Jump where there is said to be a better water-supply. The new post is about 3,000 yards distant from the Pilani Sunt hill. The officer in charge of the post, named Hassani, has threatened Nur Mohd and Bingow, Baluch residents of Be-Gadag-i-Kunar, with imprisonment for reporting the activity of Iranian Nizamis near Filani Sunt to the political authorities. Nur Mohd, who owns land in Pishin, is consequently afraid of entering Iran.jU-w K .n Copy of a Confidential memorandum No. 51-Con, dated the 14th March 1939, from the Political Agent, Chagai. In conversation with Killian Khan s/o Mir Kiya Khan Reki I gathered that the Iranian Survey party left Gorani for political reasons and probably are not returning - at any rate this year. 2. The reasons are that Mir Jiand Khan Yarmuhammadzai died in jail in Meshed six months ago. His two sons Paqir Muhammad, and Bejar Khan are still in jail in Meshed. (Shah Sov/ar (deceased; is the father of Sirdar Khubyar Khan Yarmuhammadzai and the nephew of Jiand Khan). As a result neither the Yarmuhammadzais nor* the Gamshadzais to whom the Yarmuhammadzais are closely akin and related would go near the Survey party nor assist them. They were afraid of arrest, and the Survey party latterly seems to have anticipated a general attack upon them by the Damani tribes, and so moved off before the attack materialised. 3. Kulian Khan and Mir Kiya Khan visited General Abdul Rezza at Gorani and they gathered from him that the General was anxious regarding the hostility of the Gamshadzais, and Yarmuhammadzais, and the possible collusion between them and the Ismailzais to prevent the Survey which the General wished to carry out. 4. Kulian Khan seems positive, that the Survey Party will not return from Seistan to the Chagai Iranian border fbr the present.• 2 • day, and the Gentr d Goveraatut mi^ht vory easily find that the tribes itfiich suffer iaoat at his hands will themselves t ive trouble if nothing; is done* The oonduot of Haroi troops during, the last visit of the rovornor of 'tekran to Khwasii, atiows Uiat sooner or later the Iranian Oovernoent will be forced to take action.

In Kandahar and Kata- waz, however, there are the usual under currents which are being carefully watched by the authorities. In the former Province, a movement sponsored by a few malcontents has, as its aims, secret subversive propaganda and the encouragement of acts likely to embar rass the Government. The steps already taken by the authorities, and the enqui ries that are in progress show, however, that the intentions of the organisers are known, and that the leaders are receiv ing due attention. In Katawaz, the situation is much the same as reported last week. There has been no relaxation on the part of the authorities; on the contrary the treatment meted out to Ghilzai youths who escaped from Kabul, and their parents, shows a determina tion to enforce the terms imposed on the tribes. Meanwhile, rumour succeeds rumour, each one indicating that the Central Government is firmly determine ed to settle the Ghilzai question onbe and for all time, and each one creaf dng a counter rumour that preparation^ are afoot to continue the struggle/when opportunities are favourable. / In Iran, reports received in/icate that the Iranian Government inpnd moving in force against Jumma Khan, Ismail- zai, a notorious bandit £mief, who has been a thorn in their side for some con siderable time. Troops, with necessary equipment and tramq^ort, have been moved from Kirmap, and high Military officials have called out a reconnais sance from Sdstan to Khwash. It appears that &gt;ne intention is to force Jumma Kh^tn to retire towards the Afghan oi/British border and to inter cept bin/ before he finds refuge in foreign territory. Jumma Khan is, however, apparently aware of the inten tions of the Iranian Government, and besides making arrangements for/his own safety in the event of opposition being too strong, he is obtaining pro mises of support from leading/Sardars. He is also taking steps to spread dis content amongst Government troops. At the same time he is engaging in hostile acts and openly declaring that nothing will induce him to settle with the Ira nian Government. / AFGHANISTAN. Kandahar. 1. The r^/ival of propaganda against the present regime, which has already been reported, has continued and is being Watched closely by the Afghan authorities. Although the movement ma^ be termed pro-Amanullah it is directed with equal force against the ptesent ruling family and aims at en couraging any act that may embarrass the Government. It has been reported previously that Ali Jan Muhd. (W. W.-173-A.) was taking a leading part in this movement, and that one of his colleagues was Khair Gul Khan (W. W.-397). They have been communicating secretly with Sule- man Khel of Katawaz and with Tokhis encouraging them to rise again in the spring. Paragraph 12 refers to the Tokhi question. Khair Gul Khan is being kept under surveillance. He is be lieved to have given a bribe of Rs. 5,000 (A) to Abdur Rauf, head clerk of the Kandahar C. I. D., in order to be re lieved of this annoyance. The latter has accompanied the Governor to Kabul and has promised to represent the case there. As mentioned above the Government are aware of the movement and nre watching it closely. In the case of Ali Jan Muhd. they are reluctant to take extreme measures as he is much respect ed and venerated in Kandahar. They 'v FOREIGN SECRETARY’S j l ffter No. *7 Oated , 0 M r ueccived 7 F_ - *2 have, however, detailed Muhd. Zafar Khan (W. W.-688), Hakim of Mahal jat, his close friend, to visit him frequently and endeavour to discover his plans and collaboration. Qazi Sahib Jan, a junior Qazi of Kandahar, is said to be secretly investi gating the matter on behalf of the Pre mier and to be reporting direct to him. Another individual, Khalifa Abdur Rahim, a disciple of the Naqib Sahib of Chaharbagh (W. W.-546), was sus pected of having had some secret con nection with Pir Ali Haider Shah (W. W.-171-A.), in 1936, and was arrested about four months ago. He has been sentenced to three years’ imprisonment in Kandahar. Some time ago one Habibullah, Ishaq- zai of Garmsel, a prominent Khan of his tribe, was also under suspicion. Fearing arrest he fled to Nushki. Later he returned to Kandahar on safe-con duct but, on arrival there, was sentenc ed to deportation to Afghan Tur kestan. Together with his family he left for Khanabad about the loth Novem ber. 2. During the past months a series of highway robberies have occurred in Khakrez and Kushk-i-Nakhud. Enqui/ ries have been in hand and, it is reliably reported, one Abdullah, TV'azir of Shah- jui, is suspected of being the leader of the gang. 7 3. The Premier is said to have given Ghulam Mahmud Akhunzada,/rokhi of Ulan Robat, Kalat-i-GhilzaiJxousin of W. W.-397, a sum of Rs. /o,000 (A), for expenses for pilgrimage to Mecca. As already reported this individual had proceeded via Kabul. / 4. The Id was celebrated with much rejoicing in Kandaha/on the 5th Dec ember. A large gathering assembled for prayers in the Idgan where a Kandak, with band, was on/parade. After pray ers a reception whs held in the Burj-i- Arq. / About 50 short sentence prisoners are reported to have been released on the occasion. / In Spiiy6aldak a fair was held which attracteizr a fair number of people, in cluding some from Chaman. Far ah. 5. It is reliably reported that for some time Baluch inhabitants of Chaknasur have been under suspicion of maintain ing too friendly relations with their fellow tribesmen residing across the border in Iran. Both are said to render mutual help in time of need. The Governor of Kandahar, now in® Kabul, is expected to represem this question to the Central Government and to recommend that Afghan Baluchis be removed to another area i£ Afghanis tan. / / HeraF. 6. The Governor is still on tour in his province. F. M. Muhd. Qasim Khan is acting for him during his absence. 7. The “Tul-i-Afghan ,, , of 4th Dec ember, announces that a female hospital has been opened for Badghist (Kala Nao) and another for Ghorat has been sanctioned. Ghazni and Katawaz. #. Some of the powindahs who are wintering in the Gomal area are report ed to have raided into Katawaz and to have stolen 60 camels belonging to Andars. To prevent a recurrence one Kandak from Jani Khel, under K. M. Ghulam Haider Khan, has been patrol ling to the South and has arrested two Mir Khan Khel, Sultan Khel. The majo rity of the raiders are said to belong to this section. 9. It is reliably reported that another party of ten Ghilzai boys, who were at school in Kabul, escaped and arrived in Katawaz about the end of November. The Hakim of Jani Khel made enqui ries but the fathers denied that the boys had returned. Through secret investi gation it was discovered that the boys were being kept hidden in their homes. The boys and their fathers were taken into custody and sent to Kabul early this month. On arrival at Ghazni the Governor is reported to have adminis tered a sound beating to the boys before sending the whole party on to Kabul. 10. A party of three Suleman Khel, residents of Jani Khel, passed through Quetta, en route to Calcutta, cn the 12th December. These men stated that their people are still purchasing rations from Government sources at an appro ximate rate of Rs. 4 (A) per seer. They further stated that the buying of food from other than Government is forbid den.11. Rumours amongst the resident tribes succeed each other rapidly. Taraks, Andar and other Ghilzais are saying that as long as the trouble in Waziristan lasts the Suleman Khel will not submit to the Afghan Government. Another story is that the Premier in tends to offer land in Turkistan to the Ghilzais and so gradually move the whole tribe there. Still another interesting theory is being circulated to the effect that Malang Ghulam Qadir (The Marwat Malang) is really a follower of the Faqir of Ipi. The Afghan authorities are said to have information that Ghulam Qadir’s arrival in Katawaz was at the instigation of the British Government, whose object was to foment trouble in Afghan territory and so prevent tribes men from there joining the hostile lash- kars in Waziristan. 12. The land in the Shahjui area which was occupied by Wazirs in Amanullah’s reign, and later sold to Kharots under the present regime, has always been regarded by the Tokhis as theirs. They are now saying that if the Suleman Khel renew their rising against Government they will attack and drive the Kharots from the land. 13. It is reported from several sources that Malik Sher Khan, Jalal Khel Sultan Khel [known as the “Gud” (lame) Malik], with about 10 /other Sultan Khel Maliks, all of whqfn had been anti-Government in the/distur bances but had submitted later/and had been allowed to proceed on migration, visited Kabul from Dera Istnail Khan early in November. The Premier inter viewed them and is said W have repeat ed Government’s terms for a settlement. They returned to Dera/lsmail Khan, about the 24th November, and are re ported to be trying Jo induce other Maliks to visit Delh/ to get the Afghan Consul General to/intercede for them and obtain easier terms. Economic. 14. It is reliably reported that a sum of 60 lakhs (A) has been sanctioned for the complet^6n of the Boghra Canal. 15. The $hirkat-i-Ashami is said to have suffered heavy loss this year in its Karakuli branch. The Shirkat i-Itte- hadia of Herat has also been involved and is estimated to have incurred a 40 per cent. loss. 16. Collection of revenue in Herat Province for the current year is report ed to be complete. Hakims have been ordered to collect certain oumanding balances which have been owing for some years. / 17. Owing to pilgrims from Afgha nistan bringing drafts, febtalling about 2 lakhs, on the Chaman branch of the Afghan National Bank the former office has been unable to meet the demand and has closed its doork pending receipt of more cash which Kabul has been asked to supply. The pilgrims have been put to much inconvenience through this delay. / 18. Owing to the scarcity of Indian money in Kandahar and Chaman the rate of exchange has fallen. Formerly the rate/was approximately Rs. 360 (A) for Rs/ 100 Indian. It now varies between Rs. 390 (A) and Rs. 400-(A) for Rs. 100 Indian. M).

It is believed that half will be sent to Khwash and half to Zahidan with the object of dealing with Jumma Khan, Ismailzai, the notorious bandit chief. It is also reported that three armoured cars arrived at Khwash during the past week. Jumma Khan, Ismailzai, appears to be aware of the intentions of the Ira nian Government and is preparing to resist the attack. He has been busy during the past few weeks in obtaining promises of help from leading Sardars, and has been sowing seeds of discord amongst Iranian levies and troops. Sardar Mehrullah Khan, Reki, of Mir Jawa, who recently suffered a loss of 800 sheep at the hands of Ismailzais has consented to assist Jumma Khan against the Iranian troops in return for a pro mise that the Rekis will not, in future, be raided by the Ismailzais, and that the stolen sheep will be returned. That Mehrulla Khan intends implementing his promise is indicated by his advice to 150 Iranian sepoys of his tribe to desert with their rifles to Jumma Khan’s side when the attack begins, and his preparations for retreat in the event of defeat. He is reported to have despatched his private property to a secure hiding-place in the hills near Juzzak in British territory. Jumma Khan is, in addition, report ed to have obtained a promise of help from Sardar Khubyar Khan Yarmohd- zai. At the same time, it appears that he is not very certain of his ability to resist to the full the attack of Iranian troops. Outwardly, he is treating with contempt all steps of Iranian officials to bring about a peaceful settlement. During the last month he is reported to have contemptuously ignored a friendly message from Mehdi Quli Khan Taj- bux, the Governor of Mekran, and to ^ have replied that he would openly take steps to embarrass the Iranian Govern ment. Secretly, however, he is reported to have sent two of his four wives, and a great deal of his private property to Ramishk where Abdul Hussain Khan, Baluch, another notorious bandit chief resides, and to have despatched two messengers t^ Nawab Habibullah Khan of Kharan requesting asylum in the event of defeat. These messengers, it is reported, have not yet returned. Meanwhile, it appears that Jumma Khan’s threat to harass the Iranian Government is no idle boast, as the fol lowing incidents which are reported to have occurred during the last month, will show : — (a) An Iranian caravan carrying carpets and Durr is proceed ing from Kirman to Bam was looted by Ismailzais. {b) A caravan consisting of 40 camels laden with dates, pro ceeding from Khabis to Kirman was looted by Ismail zais. The camels were driven away by the tribe. (c) A village in the Narmashir dis trict was attacked and looted by the Ismailzai tribe. Shops were broken into and cloth, barley and wheat stolen. (d) On 28th November 1937 Jumma Khan despatched two parties to loot the Naroi tribe. The first party, commanded by his son Jalal-ud-Din, attacked a village near Speh killing nine men and two women and returned with two rifles belong ing to Iranian sepoys. The second party, commanded by his son Jalal Khan, attacked another village near Speh on the 30th November but return ed empty-handed after serious ly injuring the Malik of the village. (e) About 50 men of the Ismailzai tribe have been sent to Dehak and Dahu to loot lorries coming from Khwash,V ExAffairsDept—S2—12-1-38 22. 5 to (/) Jumma Khan has sent 110 men to the Narmashir district with the object of attacking Narois and killing Muhd. Sharif Khan brother of Sardar Malik Shah Khan. Reports received indicate that the Iranian Government hope that the severe cold, combined with moderate pressure from Kirman and Bam will drive Jumma Khan from the hills in the direction of the Afghan or British border and thus enable the troops at Zahidan and Khwash to intercept him if he attempts to seek refuge in foreign territory. It is also believed that the Iranian Government expect that the troops in Zahidan and Khwash will be able to prevent sympathisers from Afghanistan and Baluchistan going to the help of Jumma Khan. Colour is given to these reports by the recent movements of high Civil and Military officials during the past fortnight.' Sartip Mehdi Quli Tajbux, the Ayalat- i-Mekran, and Sartip Mohd. Ali Puria, the G. O. C. Mekran after a tour in Sistan returned to Zahidan on the 3rd December. On the 5th December two Sartips (Brigadiers) from Tehran and one from Kirman arrived at Zahidan The following day, five Sartips in all left Zahidan for Khwash. 25. It is reported that troops in Iranian Baluchistan haye been re-armed with German five-shot iufles. 26 26. Iranian officials have been busv recently in Irafshan, Sarbaz, Dizzak and Bakhshan distributing Sajis, i.e.. Nationality certificates. These cer tificates are used more for the purpose of calling up men for service than for establishing identity and are unpopular. In consequence, it is believed that about 150 men have gone into hiding. Mir Mohd. Shah Khan, who fled to British territory last year in order to avoid being given an iden tity certificate, is now, however, helping the Iranian officials. He has been placed in charge of the Dizzak area ahd has been charged with the responsibility of controlling crime. He is reported to have been allowed to collect Dah-Yak, i.e., one-tenth of all produce from the area. His son Mir Murad Khan is being paid 30 Tumans monthly for assisting the Sadid officers. o E 2 i 7 \T The &lt;Islah ’ newspaper of the 25th November states that according to reports published in Iranian news papers, the Government of Iran intends purchasing a number of railway engines for newly-constructed railways, and also proposes constructing docks for the building of ships in Bandar-i-Pahlevi, Necessary equipment is to be purchased with a sum of £2,13,875 which has been allotted from reserves. 28.

A meeting between Juma Khan and Major Behman, Governor of Zahidan, was arranged during the month. Major Behman is believed to be endeavouring to discover what foundation exists for the continual rumours of Juma Khan’s intention to cross the border into Afghanistan. A number of Afghan Sardars also interviewed Juma Khan but neither party would appear to have gained any definite information of the latter’s movements, which are rendered all the more uncertain owing to the strict control of the tribal food supplies as a result of which his tribe has become disintegrated. A party of Mohamed Khan Gurich’s followers visited Bug during the month in order to gauge the reception they would receive should they decide to cross the border into British territory.■ CONFIDENTIAL fits hep EXTRACT FROM^PQLITICAL DIARY FOR TH E MONTH OF AUSUST, 1936. f : 2. IRANIAN BALUCHISTAN. Juina Khan, Ismailzai, has now returned to his tribal haunts on the Pir Suran range. It is rumoured, however, that the Afghan authorities have offered to provide him with land and employment for 800 Ismailzais should he wish to migrate into Afghan territory. Biburg, brother of ouma Khan, and &lt; alal, the latter^ son who are already in Afghanistan, are reported to be carrying on negotiations with Mullah Rahim., a son—in—law of Juma Khan, who has been authorised to offer border Baluchis service in Afghanistan on the following terras:- Pay, Rials 70/- per month unmounted and Rials 120/- per month for camelry. Juma Khan has not yet made any decisive move in the matter. Owing to the control of food supplies by the Iranian authorities a number of Baluch families have been compelled to cross the border into Afghanistan. In many cases the male members of the family have remained in Iran and are awaiting opportunities to loot the Iranian soldiery. Haji Jalal-ud-Din, brother of Malik Mohamed Khan dvrgish is reported to be endeavouring to persuade his brother to return to Iran. Mohamed Khan who has obtained lands for cultivation in the Chakansur district of Afghanistan, is unwilling however to return unless he be given definite assurance that he will not be molested in future. r*1 f: P.Z.6476/36. Extract from Khoraaan Political Diary for the month of July, 1936. 2. IRANIAN BALUCHISTAN . It has been learnt that the Iranians have certain tribesmen who inhabit British Baluchistan in their pay as informers. Three of these are said to reside near Kacha. Two are named Hasan (one is also sometimes known as Husain Khan) and a third Gulzar. One of these is stated to be a near relative of the wife of Khalil Khan Reki ( son of Shah Beg). The fact that the Iranians immediately offer employment to Baluchis who have been found unsatisfactory in our employment in the Chagai Levy Corps does not shew any great desire to co-operate in maintaining order on the frontier. Such dismissed malcontents are only too prone to promote difficulties. The tribal situation in Iranian Baluchistan is obscure, but it is certain that discontent is v/idespread. The tribal Mullahs still retain considerable influence, and they are most tactlessly handled by the local authorities. Recently great offence has been caused by the arrest of Qazi Ahmed Khan, a Mullah of Iranshahr, who was sent to Khwash and there charged with fomenting trouble against the Government. He had in fact objected to the endeavours of the Governor of Iranshahr to get a married Baluch woman into his household as a ’’temporary 1 ’ wife. The son of the late Dost Mohamed is also reported to be very discontented with the treatment meted out to him. Lashkaran, the Gumshadzai Sardar, has been told to surrender arms, in which case he is offered a post in the Gendarmerie. Failing compliance with this order he is to leave Iranian territory. Pressure has been brought to bear upon tribesmen who are suspected of supporting Juma Khan. They/They are not allowed to purchase grain. The entire grain supplies of the Sistan area (which normally supplies Iranian Baluchistan) have Been 'monopolised 0 by the Government, firstly for the use of the Army and secondly for sale to the Baluch tribes. This control of grain supply affords the Government a very potent weapon for control of the tribes, since they can, for the time being, practically starve them. That this state of affairs can long defeat the Baluchis is however impossible. Means of smuggling grain from Zabul to Baluchistan will very soon be devised - reports indicate that illicit traffic in grain has already started. Juma Khan, Ismailzai, returned to his tribal haunts in the Pir Suran range in August. The Iranians have promised not to interfere with him provided that he does not harbour persons who are abnoxious to the Government. Juma Khan does not trust the Iranians and maintains close touch with his relatives in Afghanistan whither he will emigrate if in danger. Abadi Khan, son of Sardar Din Mahomed of Chahbar, is to leave for Tehran as a hostage, when his father will return to the tribal lands. There are continual reports of arms reaching Baluchis from the Persian Gulf Coast. Abdul Hussain Kameran is stated to smuggle them. Rifles of German manufacture known to the tribesmen as Chahargush are reported to be on sale at Rials 400 each including 100 rounds of ammunition. Later reports indicate that the economic pressure exerted by the Government through the wheat control is driving tribesmen into British territory. Numbers have already left the settlements of Jalk, Dehak and Karvandar and have gone to the neighbourhood of Kach and Panjgur in British territory. Many Ismailzais from Pir Suran and Khwash have crossed into Afghan territory. Unless improved conditions encourage the latter to return, they may be expected to supplement their meagre resources/resources 'by raiding the Zahidan - Meshed and Z&amp;hidan - Mirjawa roads. This emigration appears to have somewhat alarmed the authorities, who have announced that when old stocks of grain have 'been cleared, new stocks will he sold at a cheaper rate. Some tribesmen are said to have delayed their departure to see if this statement will prove to have been true, but the general impression is that they are waiting to collect the date crop and once this is gathered emigration will accelerate. The sale of loaf sugar and tea has also been controlled by the Military authorities in the Sarhad. The price of loaf sugar (cones) was fixed at Rials 8 per 13 lbs. The tribesmen do not buy at this rate but obtain their requirements from smugglers. Motor drivers, however, buy at Khwash and sell at Zahidan where the rate is considerably higher.* 4^^, '^- fr v 0 ^'/^V (a; iifi v orta &amp;ra twlog M&amp;da to tan&amp;lnate the feud hjt^ween the iinuri end the leaellael tribes* Jusis Khsn Isasilasi however doubts the sincerity of the proposals put forward by the Iranian Officials and is reluctant to coae to terns* The authorities * consequently threatened to take military action against him unless he submits in the near future* Juaa khan, who has 2000 armed men under his orders ana yro^ises of assistance froa the i&amp;ajorlty of the Baluch oardars, considers himself sble to withstand attack* The fact that the Xarmohamedsale have recently placed themselves undsr his protsction has doubtlass increased his assuranos*Confidential Minute Pap&lt; - r. aiuticH coiidULAiK oauKUAL foa ; 5012 T 11 ^’ WSQhtim t***) *Uited the - ....... * ^ - ’0 J '2 y for tae aonth Of May igag . /?^ 1. l3AiilM.a^gui:icXAH XH&amp; (&amp;} In the absence of aardar Juioa • hr.n, vho last month Joined forces with Zaman Khan (Btinri) and hlroti» Chief of the Uablki tribe» Kohl Khan, oousln of Jnma Khan, and J^ulla Jamal Din have been recognised by the Iranian officials as joint Chiefs of the I&amp;mftllzais* Jama Khan is reported to have appealed to friendly Garclars in Afghanistan for assistance in his struggle against the Iranian authorities who now fear &amp; general rising of the Baluch tribes aided by their sympathisers in Afghanistan and India* Jith the exception of the BeKis and Karuls, most of the Baluch tribes are in sympathy with Juma Khan Ismailaal and have offered support* The Naruis fear that the lam&amp;llsais, having left the Fir Suran hills and having taken up residence at Narmashir, will be likely to raid them from the latter locality* The Karui tribesmen have tried there fore to compel their leader to compromise with fume Khan and the B&amp;mari and Chayakl Garoars are also acting as intermediaries to effect a reconciliation, but the prospects are poor inasmuch as a clash has recently occurred in which the Karuis lost seven killed and have retaliated by raiding Ismailsai flocks* a party of f&amp;ruahommedsals on the way to join Jum&amp; Khan fell in with two companies of troops, a fight ensued near GARINC&amp;aJ?

The Iranian party then tied them up with ropes beat dhem and took them across the border to Kuhak where they were made to crouch on all fours like animals for two whole days. Eventually a man named Karim Dad' Burhanzai of Kuhak intervened and obtained their release but the three guns are still in the possession of the Iranian soldiers. The Grawag road is at present impassable owing to heavy rain but the Assistant Political Agent Mekran has been directed to make investigations on the spot as soon as the road is open, and to instruct the Mekran Levy Corps posts to keep a careful look out for any further incursions by Iranian soldiers. 2_S- «2I—— 8.

On the 12th April two men were seen near Lar by the Lar Post Levies with two camels. Suspecting that the camels had been stolen from Iranian territory, the Post Officer ordered the men to surrender, which they refused to do.

Transborder .—A caravan was looted recently between Khwash and Iranshahr (Bampur) by Yarmuhammadzais, six men being killed and thirty-six camels with their loads looted. An Iranian pursuit party succeeded in arresting two raiders and recovering five of the camels at Gurani in Iranian territory, while other tracks were followed up to the British border. A message was sent to the Post Officer Sohtagan who arranged for a Kharan pursuit party to follow up the raiders. This party succeeded in arresting two more raiders and recovering five more camels together with some cloth. The property recovered was later handed over to the Iranians at Killa Safaid. 11.

The Persian authorities are said to have attempted to separate Sardar Juma Khan, Ismailzai, from his tribe by offering terms to him at the expense of ^ his tribe. Another report states that the Persians demanded that Sard^r Juma Khan should surrender his privately- owned weapons. He refused, saying that all the looted rifles had been return ed. 407. Reinforcements are expected in Zahidan from Meshed. The reported strength of the reinforcements varies— two regiments appears to be an average estimate. 408. The arrival of 12 guns in closed lorries is reported from Zahidan, about the 8th March. 409. Ihe V armuhammadzais and the Ismailzais have threatened to start raid ing again if in fifteen days time their Sardars are not released from prison. 410. The Yarmuhammadzais were told that Jiand Khan’s son, Bajjar Khan, had been released at Meshed and that he was on his way home. The delay in his appearance may be due to the truth of the rumour of Jiand Khan’s death in prison and the reluctance of the Persian officials to allow the news to reach the Yarmuhammadzais. 411. About the 5th March the Yar muhammadzais attacked a caravan between Khwash and Iran Shahr (Bampur) and took away 36 camels with their loads. Six men of the caravan are said to have been killed. The Amir-i- Lashkar sent out parties in pursuit of the raiders and two men and five camels were brought in from Gorani (Persian territory) (C). On a report having been received that the raiders were in British territory the Levy Risaldar at Sohtagan sent a party out which arrested two men with five camels. When he delivered these men at Jalk the Persian authorities declined to take them over. The prison ers were therefore sent to Nok Kundi where they will remain until arrange ments are made to send them to be hand ed over to the Persians at Kila Safed. 412. On the 13th March four Yar muhammadzais stopped a lorry near Ware Chah. They found that it con tained only ‘qand’ (loaf sugar) so allow ed the driver to go. The driver reported the incident to the frontier Assistant through the Levies at Juzzak. Two par ties each of six Levies were sent out from Juzzak and Nok Kundi to patrol the railway line and shots were exchang ed with the raiders who escaped into Persian territory.Extract from Baluchistan Intelligence Bureau Summary No.10, for the week ending 0 8th March, 1935. x / O ' 340. Sarhad Affairs . - The Anglo-Persian Border Conference took place at Zahidan on the 16th February. The Conference was held under the auspices of Amir-i- Lashkar Amanullah Mirza Djehanbani, Inspector General of the Persian Forces. The other delegates were Sarhang (Colonel) Arfa and Sultan (Captain) Mastofi. It is stated that the Persian officials adopted rather a non-conciliatory attitude mainly because they were under the impression that the Baluch rebels were afforded shelter in British Baluchistan and the present international boundary was a source of dissatisfaction. 341. The Amir-i-Lashkar flew to Khwash on the 19th February where ip an interview with some Baluch Sardars, he rewarded Shah Sowar Yarmuhdzai, who surrendered six looted rifles. shah Sowar explained to the Amir-i- Lashkar that outrages were committed because the people could not tolerate the repression by Sartip Abbas Khan, also that they were angered by the arrest of Jiand Khan aid his sons. The Persians are reported to be optimistic over the pacification of the frontier.“‘'T Notes. Minute To Under Sec Secretary Committe Under Se&lt; Secretary Previous pa 2730Notes.

SUBJECT. iT ^ PERSO-BALUCHISTAN FRONTIER. Shooting of a Chagai levy hy Persian frontier guards near Rohat. Copy of to 2,9 APR W55 Previous papers :— FOR INFORMATION. Please see the Government of India’s telegram of 16th January, submitted at P.Z.342/35 below. Although the facts of this incident are extremely uncertain, and must probably remain so, the detailed report now attached puts a somewhat different complexion upon the affair, ♦rom the Government of India’s telegram of 16th January^ It is apparently doubtful whether the Ghagai levies were really in British territory even when they first met the Persian guards. The story of the surviving levy is that he and his companion were on their way to inspect a boundary pillar on Kuh-i-Malik Siah when they fell in with the Persian guards, who persuaded 2730 1000 4.34them to go and see their Naib (N.C.O.) about the position of the frontier; and that on their way there an attempt was made by the Persians to arrest them, which led to the shooting. It is extremely difficult to understand why the British levies should have allowed themselves thus innocently to be enticed into Persian territory. the Assistant to the Chagai Political Agent, draws attention in his report to some of the points which it is difficult to explain (page 3)&gt; and suggests that it is more likely that the levies and the Persian sepoys may have had some private business together, and that the Persians, on some pretext, enticed the levies into a prepared trap. It is relevant that one of the Persian guards belonged to a Baluch tribe at enmity with the Ismailzais, to which tribe the Chagai levy belonged. Action has now been taken to remove the Reki and Ismai^elements in the Chagai Levy Corps from the frontier posts. SEEN POLITICAL COMMITTEE- Apr meBy Air Mail, CONFIDENTIAL. l/i A P V- Memohandum from the Hon’ble the Agent to the Governor General and Chief Commissioner in Baluchistan to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, No. 409-P.S., dated Sibi, the 26th January 1935. Subject:— Alleged Shooting of a Chagai Levy by Persian Guards near Robat. 4 Keference your telegrams Nos. 132 dated the 16th January 1935 and 206 dated! the 24th January 1935 on the above subject. 1 enclose herewith a copy of a report received from the Assistant to the Political Agent in Kalat and of Chagai based on enquiries made by him at the scene of this occurrence. It is unfortunate that the Assistant to the Political Agent was compelled, owing to the poverty of the railway service beyond Nushki, to proceed before he could be supplied with a copy of the map of the frontier area prepared after Captain Bomford’s survey of 1932, and the sketch map to which he refers in his report has been of little assistance to him. His report has however now been examined with reference to Captain Bomford’s map, a copy of which was received with Foreign and Political Department endorsement No. F-165-N/32, dated the 7th November 1932. This map shows the straight line between the highest point on the Kacha Koh and the highest point on the Koh-i-Malik Siah (the boundary defined in the Holdich agreement) and it seems evident that if the Chagai levies met the Persian sepoys at a point 2 and 2/5th miles along the Zahidan road from Robat they were very possibly even then in Persian territory. It is true that the Assistant to the Political Agent has come to the conclusion that they were in British territory but in view of his reference to a pillar on an unlocated hill named Guban Kasur, which he has presumably confused with a survey mark, his conclusion appears to be open to considerable doubt. His report is, in fact, not clear in reo-ard to the exact location of the various incidents which are alleged to ha &amp; ve terminated in the murder of the sepoy Ibrahim and he is being asked to elucidate the doubtful features. It seems however improbable that he will be able to do this without a further visit to the locality, which in my opinion is scarcely likely to be productive of result in view of the obvious difficulty of locating fixed points in relation to an undemarcated boundary in so difficult a terrain, and in view also of the doubt which exists whether the two sepoys concerned were not engaged on some private enter prise which led directly to the final event. I would remark that it is to obviate the possibility of such occurrences that action has been taken to remove the Reki and Ismailzai element in the Chagai Levy Corps from the frontier posts, as reported in my telegram No. 2 dated the 10th January 1935. In view of my comments above I have no further remarks to make on telegram No. 21 dated the 21st January 1935 from His Britannic Majesty s Consul General for Khorasan, which relates to the same occurrence. I is suggested that the case might profitably be discussed with Mr Skr , the Political Agent in Kalat and Political Agent in charge of the Bolan Pass and of Chagai District, who will be in Delhi between the 27th and 30th January.

Accompanied by the Rissaldar Major and 15 sepoys of the Chagai Levy Corps I caught the train which fortunately left for Nok Kundi that evening. The Frontier Assistant was also on the train on his way back from leave in Quetta. This train was very late arriving at Nok Kundi and we were not able to leave by lorry for Saindak till 5-30 p.m. We reached Saindak at 1-15 a.m. on the 16th January 1935 and left again at 9-15 a.m. by lorry for Robat where we arrived at 2-15 p.m. 1 recorded the statement of the Post Officer Kot Havildar Haji Dad Khuda and then, left by lorry to see the scene of occurrence. I then recorded the statement of the surviving sepoy Ghulam Ali, alias Hassan Khan, which I send herewith together with that of the Kot Havildar. From sepoy Ghulam All’s statement it will be seen that he and Ibrahim had been ordered by the Post Officer to inspect the boundary pillar on Koh-i-Malik Siah. That on their way they met two Persian sepoys who asked where they were going. On receiving the reply that they were going to inspect our boundary pillar the Persian sepoys suggested that they should make enquiries from the Persian Naib as to where the boundary runs. Our sepoys agreed to accompany them. Some distance further they wished to turn back but were dissuaded, and after about another mile met more Persian sepoys who called out to the first two to arrest our men. Hearing this Ibrahim drew his revolver and was immediately shot by the Persians. Ghulam Ali escaped unhurt. He returned later with the Post Officer and a party to find the body of Ibrahim had been dragged some distance and partially stripped. i At the place where he and Ibrahim first met the Persian sepoys he had erected a small cairn to mark the spot and this cairn was 2 and 2/5ths miles from Robat on the Robat Zahidan road. I measured this by the speedometer of the lorry. From this point we left the road and bore left up a nullah bed. After a short time we had to abandon the lorry and proceeded on foot, so 1 was not able to measure the other distances. Ghulam Ali had erected another cairn at the spot where he and Ibrahim had told the Persians that they would go no further. This place was about 5 miles from Robat the way we came. Less than a mile beyond this was the spot where Ibrahim was killed. I saw the bloodstains on the ground and also an empty car tridge case and the actual bullet which killed him. I forward these here with, as in the event of the Persians denying that the murder was committed by their troops it ma^ be possible to show that the cartridge case is of the same pattern as that issued to their troops. The spot to which the Persians had dragged the body was 420 paces from the scene of the murder. We noticed that there were fresh tracks of boots here (i.e. at the spot to which the body had been dragged) and an attempt had been made to obliterate all signs of its ever having been there. However by scrapping away the sand we found more bloodstains. I had cairns erected at both places, but as the Persians will probably destroy these we buried a stone bearing blood marks in a hole close by. Trns stone was signed by Havildar Shah Beg Reki so that it m ^y he identified. It is, I am afraid, impossible for me to say whether the actual scene || of the murder is inside our boundary or not. The boundary runs from • a pillar on Koh-i-Malik Siah to a pillar on Guban Kasur and this latter hill is not visible from the spot, nor was there any land mark by which I could fix the exact point on the map and it is alsq impossible to sa y ^ far the spot is from Robat as the crow flies. There is, however no doubt \ that the place at which our sepoys met the Persians is well p n the Britis ? side of the ‘red’ line shown on the sketch map forwarded to the Political ? A^ent Chagai,. with Secretary to the Agent to the Governor General s ‘ Express Letter No. 154-S.C. dated the 29th February 1932 K and the fact \ | that the Persians enticed Ibrahim to a place possibly inside their border provides them with no excuse for shooting him.We then returned to Robat which I reinforced by six men with orders that no party is to leave the post unless it is at least six men in strength. As Kot Havildar Haji Dad Khuda is the father of the dead man I thought it advisable to take him with me to Saindak where he will stay for the present so that he may not be tempted to ta^e the law into his own hands and shoot some of the Persian troops in revenge. We reached Saindak at midnight and returned to Nok Kundi the following day in tiine to catch the tram back to Ndshki. The Persian troops concerned have recently been posted at Satiki, a place J am unable to find on any map, but which is about half way between the scene of the murder and Koh-i-Ma^ik Siah, the distance between these two places being, as far as I could judge by eye, about 3 miles. T'he following special points arise t — (a) The statement of the Kot Havildar being mostly heresay is of course of little of no value in corroborating the truth of Ghulam Ali’s evidence.. (6) The assertion that he reported the creation of the new Persian post at Satiki, and warned Jamadar Wazir Khan that it was datigerous to visit the pillar on Koh-i-Malik Siah appears to be quite untrue. No report to this effect has been received and the Frontier Assistant was quite unaware of the existence of this post Until we arrived) at Robat. (c) It is singular that if he had anticipated any danger the Post Officer should have sent only two meh, one Of theih being his son, to inspect the pillar. (d) It is again odd that if Ibrahim was going in that direction on duty he should have gone without his rifle and merely taken a revolver. (e) One of the Persian sepoys, according to Ghulam Ali’s statement ? was a Naroi Sherzai and Ibrahini was an Ismailzai. There has recently been a fracas between these two tribes in which several men on each side were killed. (/) SSatiki post being a new one nothing appears to be knowm about the men stationed therein, but as the men at Shameafif, the ' next Persian post, are mostly Persian Baluchis it may be reasonably presumed that some of the men at Satiki are also local tribesmen. (o) Why should Ibrahim and Ghulam Ali on their way to visit an existing boundary pillar have allowed themselves to be pursu- aded bv two tresspassing Persian sepoys to go and ask a Persian Naib where the boundary was j They do not appear to have made any enquiries from the Persians as to what they were doing in our territory. From a consideration of these points it appears to me to be more likely that Ibk’ahim was going on some private business, that the. Persian sepoys knew of this and themselves having some personal interest m that business, TArotAvt. IaH him into a Dreoared trap whe^*® £bey murdered him. knew of this and themselves having some pei&amp;uuai iulcicol m , 7 t!’ on some pretext led him into a prepared trap where tlicv murder ed The fact that the parties happened to be servants of their respect lye Gov ernments is probably purely accidental. It is unfortunate that G mil am All is the only material witness. I tried to make him explain to me why he and Ibrahim allowed themselves to be led off by the two Persian se P o y^ but he merely repeated that they had been asked to go and see the Naib, on f hov WATlt. I have instructed the Frontier AssistaiH to cohtinue making enquiries, In the hopes that we may find out more about the affair but in tny dpmion it is doubtful that any further explanation wiH be forthcoming.4 Statement of Ghulam Ali alias Hassan Khan sepoy No. 20 Chagai Levy Corps of Robat Post. i ' On solemn affirmation. I and Ibrahim were ordered to go and see the pillar on Koh-i-Malik Siah and to patrol our border. At the place where I have erected a small cairn (2-2/5 miles from Robat by the speedometer of the lorry) we met two Persian sepoys. They were coming towards Robat. They asked us where we were going and we said we were going to see our boundary pillar. They said they did not know where the boundary was, but suggested that we should go and see their Naib who would know where the boundary was. Ibrahim and I accompanied them. When we got to the place where I have erected a second cairn (about five miles from Robat) we refused to go any further because we wanted to go and see Koh-i-Malik Siah and they were taking us out of our way. They pursuaded us to come on and see their Naib. When we got to the place marked by the third cairn (the scene of the murder about six miles from Robat) I was behind and Ibrahim was ahead with the sepoys. I saw two sepoys on the top of the little cliff overlooking the cairn and about ten other men posted on hills round about. The two men on the cliff shouted to our two Persian sepoys to arrest us. Ibrahim pulled out his pistol and the two men with him fired at him before he could fire. The first shot hit him in the hand. I think he fired once after that and then a second bullet hit him in the chest. I ran back to a small hill and fired five rounds. The Persians seized Ibrahims pistol and bando lier and fled. All the Persians then made off into the hills. I then returned to the post as I was only one man against 10. I reported to the Post Officer. I accompanied the Post Officer to the scene of the occurrence and found the Persians had dragged Ibrahim’s body to the place I now point out (420 paces away). One of the two sepoys who escorted us and who afterwards shot Ibrahim was a Naroi Sherzai Baloch. The other was a Persian. They ;were wearing uniforms and had badges in their hats. (note) The Naroi and the Ismailzais are enemies and Ibrahim is an Ismailzai. * R. and A. C. , * - 1 Sd/- R. L. BAZALGETTE—16-1-35. L. hand T. I. of Ghulam Ali alias Hassan Khan. Statement of Kot Havildar Haji Dad Khuda son of Ghazi Khan Post i Officer Robat. On solemn affirmation. Jamadar Wazir Khan came to Robat in November on tour. He told me that it was the Assistant Political Agent’s order that the pillar on Koh-i-Malik Siah was to be kept in good order. I told him that the Persians had made a post near there and it might be dangerous to send men in that direction and I asked him to get the Assistant Political Agent s orders by wire. He said he would make a report to this effect. On 13th of this month, not having had any further orders, I sent my son Ibrahim and another sepoy Ghulam Ali (Hassan Khan) to see the condition of the pillar. They went off. Ghulam Ali had his rifle and Ibrahim a private pistol. I cannot say why he did not take his rifle. About three miles from Robat they met two Persian soldiers who asked them where they were going. They said they were going to see their boundary pillar,. ' ThePersians asked where this pillar was. /They said that it was on Koh-i- Malik Siah. The Persians told them to point out where their boundary ran. They did so and the Persians replied that they had better come and see the Persian Naib. They agreed. As they were going along they met two more Persian soldiers who called out to the first two to catch hold of our men. My son pulled out his pistol and the Persians who were trying to catch hold of them fired and hit my son on the hand. A second shot struck him in the chest. After being wounded in the hand he fired two or three shots from his pistol but did not hit anybody. Ghulam Ali (Hassan Khan) ran away and fired five shots from a distance but without effect. The Persians also fired at him but missed him.) He returned here about 4 p.m. and reported the facts to me. The same evening I took 10 men and ^ent to the spot. The Persians had dragged the body about 200 yards. There was no sign of the Persians. They may have seen us and run away. They had taken away his pistol and cartridges, his Government socks and chaplies, overcoat and belt and also a private waistcoat and coat and turban., ; ,We brought the body back to Robat and buried it the next day. I also reported the facts to Juzzak post as I could not get an answer from Nok Kundi. So far as I know, Ibrahim had no local enemies.j Sd. DAD KHUDA. Sd. R. L. BAZALGETTE. 16-1-35.

On the 15th January a meeting took place at Shorao between Sardar Juma Khan and the Amir-i-Lashkar, and it appears certain that the discussions which followed, ended in Sardar Juma Khan agreeing to come to terms with the Persian authorities. The terms under which Sardar Juma C Khan has agreed to surrender are not at present known, but it is generally believed in Persian Baluchistan that his demands are : (a) no Persian regulars should be stationed in his country, ( 6 ) he should not be summoned to Khwash, (c) the arms and ammunition of his tribe are not to be confiscated, (d) all prisoners belonging to his tribe who have been captured are to be released, and (e) Sartip Abbas Khan and Sardar Habibullah Khan be removed from the frontier. In return Sardar Juma Khan has undertaken to :—(a) be responsible for the peace of his country, (b) pay reve nue, (c) become a loyal Persian citizen, and (d) allow Amnia (Road Guards) in his area. It is extremely doubtful if the Persian 3 authorities would be willing to agree to the above terms, but whatever the terms are it seems certain that Sardar Juma Khan has been pacified. This is sup ported by the fact that one of Juma Khan’s sons, Jalal-ud-din recently arrived in Zahidan and has handed ovot about twelve rifles which were looted by the Ismailzais during the rebellion. ^SECRET. ^ s - \{tJL i U&amp; Baluchistan Intelligence Bureau SummarfiNaj II il^r the period 5 ending 4th January 1935. ^ Note .—Where neceseary paragraphs are lettered in the margin A, B or C.

Sarhad Affairs .—On about th&lt; 24th December a lorry was looted Yarmuhdzais while in British territory near Mirjawa, and was driven some distance into Persian territory by a cleaner who accompanied the raiding party. The k&gt;rry appears to have been looted in British territory in error, as on the situation being explained by the Frontier Assistant to Yar Mnhd. son of Sardar Jiand Khan, he collected and returned his share of the loot, while Shah Sowar is reported to have promised to collect and return his share. This raid was probably carried out by the Yarmuhdzais in the hope of inducing the garrison of Miriawa to turn out a pursuit party, who having been drawn awav from the safety of the Post, they could turn on and attack. The party, however, which turned mit, only followed the raiders for a short distance. 69. The Amir-i-Lashkar (Major- General) Amanullah Mirza, accom panied bv several other officers, 150 nizamis, K.

Amanullah Mirza has arrived in Eahidan in order to enquire into the present situation and to endeavour to persuade Sardar Juma Khan Ismailzai and his followers to surrender peace fully. Amanullah Mirza is an impoitant member of the Persian War Council, pnd distinguished himself by bringing the rebellion of the late Dctet Mnhd. Baranzai, in 1928-29 to a conclusion, successfully. He is reported to be a man of strong character, with the gift of dealing with, and subduing by tact ful persuasion, truculent and rebellious tribal leaders. He successfully won over several important supporters of the late Dost Muhd. in 1928, and there by effectively reduced the power of the latter. Sardar Juma Khan has, however, up to the time of the issue of this Summary, faded to reply to a letter addressed to him by Amanullah Mirza. He appears however, to be losing some of hir adherents, Mehrullah Khan son ol Sardar Taj Muhd. Khan, Reki, and his /followers who had joined Sardar Juma Khan, have returned to their homes. 'Unrest, in the meanwhile, continues and on about the 23rd December a cdnvoy of lorries which was carrying rations for the troops between Zahidan and Khwash, and which was escorted by 25 Persian soldiers, was attacked and kJoted. Many of the escort are reported to have been killed, including the drivers of these lorries, two of /whom, Ghulam Haidar of Haripur and Nand Lai of Hoshiarpur were Indians. Again on the 24th December about thirty camels and some donkeys were looted near Mirjawa. Amanullah Mirza has a difficult pro position before him and it remains to be seen whether he will be able to succeed in subduing the rebellious tribes of Persian Baluchistan without being compelled to resort to active measures.^ 3 35. • Persia. 99.

B On the 5th January Amanullah Mirza returned to Zahidan where he received a letter sent by Sardar Juma Khan, in which lie stated that he had on several occasions informed the authorities in Teheran that he was loyal to the Persian (i o\ ernment and ready to pay whatever revenue was due from him, but that he would have no dealings with the pre sent Sartip.

He further stated tjiat he was willing to come in to Khwash for an interview, provided- Major Sikandar Khan, the Officer Com manding the troops in Khwash and two other officers were despatched to his strong-hold as hostages.

Prior to this innovation it is reported that three lorries were stopped on the night 20th-21st October. The Sikh driver of one lorry was allowed to go untouched, but the Armenian drivers of the other two lorries had their clothes and bedding looted. It is also reported that three lorries coming from Meshed were looted near Zahidan, and their escort of three sepoys killed. .

Consulate General, Khorassan ana Sistan. (i) Persian Baluchistan . The Persians have made little progress in their efforts to pacify the Baluchis* Robberies ana attacks on isolated posts have been continual. On the night of 2/3rd December Juma Khan was attacked but repulsed the troops whose losses amounted to about 100 men. wounded were brought by night to Zahidan on December 4th. small detachments of troops to reinforce the Kwash garrison have been arriving at intervals from &amp;eshed f Zabul and Kerman. They are mostly conscripts recalled to the colours. The rebels are in a strong position on high hills. Aeroplanes have been unable to fly high enough to keep out of range, and are now xylng out of action at Kwaai. The Baluchis have made several successful sorties from their stronghold, in each case surprising the Military, inflicting casualties and capturing arms. The worst feature of the Military operations, as regards British interests, is that lorries owned and driven by Indians have been commandeered to take rations from Zahldan to Kwash. The driver of one lorry, so cormiandeered, works on a long term visa between Kundi and Zahidan ana had to furnidi cash security at the frontier for his early return from Zahidan, to prevent his working in tne interior of Persia. He informed the Military autnorities of this, ana that his money would be confiscated. As they refused to listen to his/hiQ plea, he proceeded to the Vice Consulate. While he was away the Persian troops forced his cleaner to drive the lorry to the place where it was to he loaded, when loaded they attempted to force the cleaner to leave for Kwash without the owner-driver. On his refusal, he was publicly beaten and struck with rifle butts. Meanwhile H.B.M. f s Vice Consul had made representations to the Governor, and an orderfivas given for the troops to release the lorry, whereupon they again beat the cleaner, but released the lorry. On the i^xh, three lorries driven by HAZBA SINGH, DAHBABA SINGH, and MOHAN SINGH were commandeerea and taken to Kwash. On tne 13th they returned escorted only by two soldiers in each lorry. Shortly after leaving Kwash they found the camp of some road repairers deserted and looted, and a little further on a Gendarme post deserted and burnt. The Indians pointed out that the post was alright the previous day, and th^t it would be safer to return to Kwash. The soldiers, however, compelled tnem to proceed, liiey were attacked by Baluchis. Pour soldiers were killed sitting in the lorries. Only one man made any attempt to fight and he was killed. Three fled. The drivers were ail wounded, three being unable to arive, owing to wounds in the hand. One, wounded in the shoulder, succeeded in returning on foot to Kwadi. No attempt was made to bring in the others lor four days, after which tney were taken to tne Military Hospital at Kwash. The man who first reached Kwash ran away from there and readied Zahidan from where he proceeded to Zabul to report to His Majesty’s Consul General. He states that the wounds of the other drivers nad all become septic, ana that they would probably lose their hands, if not their lives. All the lorries were damaged and looted of tyres, spares, etc.3 Notwithstanding this occurrence and others of a less serious nature, the Persians continue to iorce drivers, inadequately escorted., to use the Kwash road* repoi has just now been received to the effect that two, one Sikh, and one Muhaiijioadan, both British Indian subjects, have been killed. There are Hiany lorries owned ana driven by Persians at Zahiaan, ^nd the action of the Persians of cooiuandeerlng those of British subjects for such dangerous work is entirely unjustifiable. The military precautions taken to protect the lorries were of such a nature that the officers responsible are manifestly unfit for any sort of conmand. No effort at all has been made to organise convoys, which should be guarded by at least two lorries witn soldiers ana rrncnine guns. A report now received is to tne effect that General Jehanbani has arrived at Zahiaan from Tehran with Idu Khan. It is to be hoped that he will follow the advice of Idu Khan and secure the removal of tne present General Officer Commanding in Baluchistan whose harsh treatment of the tribes has undoubtedly brought about the present conditions There are the usual signs that the Persians are pre pared to believe the wildest rumours to tne effect that the Baluchis are instigated or at least supported by the British. Gkptain Rose, while at Zahiaan, made several excursions in the locality, which appear to have caused great suspicion. One trip which he made to Kuh-i-Kwajeh (near sistan) gave rise to the rumour that he hau gone there to install a wireless transmitting station. It is significant that a Saraar who befriended Captain Rose at Duulatabad, near Kuh-i-Kwajeh, has been sent under arrest to/to Tenran, and two unfortunate villagers who supplied transport and acted as guides have heen iiung into prison. A police Agent has heen placed outside the Consulate Gate at Zahul, ana remains there to report t il who enter or leave the Consulate. Under the circumstances H.M. f s Vice Consuls have heen instructed to refrain from touring at present, ana in case of small trips for shooting etc. to inform the local authorities of their intentions before proceeding.Og) ri (^opy to india Office and Kabul. ^0 JL r (m General* Hia Britannic Majesty’s Consulate./ W&gt;C- ’-C 2 Zabul* Dated the 3/l/35* Bn dor semen t No • l-( l/5) of 1935.

Sir, 3-1-35. / I have the honour to refer to your itespetch ITo#80 of NOYember 3rd 19 34 (No*219 to India) and to state that I have now received a report vfcich throw# some light on the subject referred to therein. Under orders from the General Officer Commanding in Baluchistan the Cantonment Commander at Zahidan sect three Reki Baluchis named Nauris Khan, Bahadur, and Hussain to Kacha (within British territory) to meet Ahmed Khan, brother of Sardar Juma Khan Ismailzai, and to request him to induce his brother Juma Khan to cease his recalcitrant attitude towards the Persians* Ahmed Khan was asked to go to Kwash to see the General Officer Commanding, who further promised that if he could curb the activities of his brother, Juma Khan, he (Ahmed Khan) would be installed in his place as Sardar of the Ismailzai tribe. Ahmed Khan is reported to have replied that he would not leave British territory. Jemadar v/azir Khan (not Havildar Beg) in charge of the Kacha Levy Post, on learning that these Rekie had entered British territory on a mission from the Persian troops, arrested them and referred the matter to the Political Officer Chagai, who ordered their release. A few days later another party of Rekis named Allahyar, Hussain and Behruz Khan (the party referred to in your Despatch No.30.) were again sent to interview Ahmed Khan. Jemadar Wazir Khan detained them and reported to the Political Agent, Chagai. As he received no reply for some time, he sent them to Kundi under escort, and on reaching Juzzak they were released by the N.C.O. in charge of Levies, underunder orders received from the Political Agent* It will be seen from the above that these men did not enter India H in the normal way' as stated by the Persians* but had beerce sent as a sort of Political Mission* without passports or documents of any kind, to treat with Persian subjects who had taken refuge in India* Inasmuch as the Persians arrest quite harmless Indians who enter Persia* without Nationality Documents, and frequently keep them in goal for months without trial, the treatment of these Persians whose visit was by no means a normal one, is in striking contra st* A copy of this Despatch is being forwarded to the Government of India in the Foreiga and Political Department, and to the ‘“on* bel the Agent to the Governor General in Baluchistan, Quetta* I have etc., Sd/- C*K*Daly, Lt* Colonel To ais Britannic ^jesty* s Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary At the Court of Persia , Tehran •3 £X_4IB_MILx A U^ZLi. X \aK' ^§) m L, ^ ^ vlfV ^ JL/ British Legation ^ ; q Tehran, November 3rd,1934. My Lord, 1 have the honour to report that the Head of the English Section of' the Ministry for Foreign Affairs recently put forward the following verbal request:- 'A complaint had been received from the Ministry of War that three Persian subjects, by name Behruz Ahan, Kadkhuda Allahyar and Hussein Baluch, who lived in the frontier zone near nirjawa were **? crossing the frontier into India in the normal way, when they were arrested by a certain Shah Bega, who is in the service of the British frontier officials and is, moreover, the brother of Idu Ahan( whose name will be familiar to you from my telegram No.32 of May 31st, 1933, and previous correspondence). Shah Beg sent these men to the frontier post at Kacha, whence they were sent on to Juzzak, where they are still detained”. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs requested that they should be released. 2. The manner in which this request was advanced is typical of the methods at present adopted by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and I do not consider that any reply should be returned to it, unless at a later date the Persian G-ovemment decide to address a note to me on the subject. Should, however, you consider it desirable to cause any enquiries to be made into this story, I should be grateful if you would be so good as to inform me of the facts for my own information.w n 3. A copy of this despatch is being sent to His esty's Consul General for Khorasan (No.8). I have the honour to be, My Lord, Your excellency's most obedient servant, Sd.R.B.Hoare.

The Foreiisn Secretary to the Government of India, To Hie Majesty’s &amp;nvoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary at the Court of reraia,Tehran. Dated New Delhi, the February 1935. Sir, With reference to Sir Keginald Hoare’a despatch No.219, dated the 3rd November 1934, I am directed to forward for your information a copy of a letter from the non'ble the Agent to the Governor General in Baluchistan, No.358~PS, dated the 24th Jenuary 1935, and to suggest that, if you see no objection, the information given there in should not be communicated to the Persian Government until after the conference at Aahidan has been concluded, i am further to observe that the Persian complaint in this case would appear to be inconsistent with their attitude on the general question of Persian subjects crossing the border into Baluchistan. On the one hand they expect the Government of India to deal effectively with rebel refugees who enter Baluchistan* while on the other they object to the arrest of individuals whom they have despatched across the frontier without papers or intimation through the proper channels. In ths absence of such intimation there are no means by which the Government of India can discriminate between the two classes. I have the honour to be. Sir, four most obedient servant, Sd.O.K.Caroe, for Foreign Secretary to the Government of India.I - Copy of a letter No,358-P*S f dated Sibi f the 24th January 1935 f from the Hon'ble the A^rent to the Governor General and Chief Commieaioner in Baluchiet&amp;n, to the Foreign secretary to the Government of India, New Delhi. Detention of Persian Subjects at Kacha. I have the honour to refer to your letter ko.D.4920-N/34, dated the 19th November 1934, forwarding a copy of a Despatch from His iiajesty's Minister at Tehran on the subject of a complaint by the Persian Minister of Foreign Affairs in regard to the arrest of certain Persian subjects near Kacha. 2. It has been ascertained that the Frontier assistant while on tour at Jussak was informed that Behro* &amp;han and his companions were on their way from Persian territory to Kacha to meet Ahmed Khan Israailzai, brother of Sardar Juma Khan Jsmailiai and a refugee from Persia, and to attempt to induce him to return. Fearing complications in the present disturb ed state of the border, the Frontier Assistant sent orders to K&amp;cha to detain Behroz Khan and his companions and himself proceeded to that post. As he was on a visit of inspection to the frontier posts he completed his tour and on his return telegraphed for instructions to the Assistant Jrolitical Agent* Kal&amp;t at Nushki. On the latter’s orders he put Behroz Khan and his two companions back across the border. 3. None of the party were in possession of passports and, as i Despatch No. 1 dated the 3rd January 1935 from His Majesty’s Consul General for Khorasan, they had been sent on a political mission into British territory with out any prior attempt having been made to obtain the concurrence of this Administration. In my opinion the action of the Frontier Assistant in arresting and detaining the party was perfectly correct though he would have exercised a wiser discretion in telegraphing earlier to the Assistant to the Political Agent in Kalat and of Chagai for orders in regard to their further detention or release..u.

Sardar Jiand Lhan, Yarmuhammadzai Daraani together with his son Bijjar Ahan, udr Chiragh Ahan, Air Rahim Khan and eleven other Yarmuhammadzai Motabirs arrived at Dalbandin on the 19th from Aindi in the Sarhad and informed the Tahsildar that they were taking refuge in British territory from the oppression of the Persian Military authorities at Khwash. As reported in previous diaries, these Yarmuhanmadzais have been refusing for some months pest to go into Ahwash and/feurrender their rifles ana it now appears that Sardar Habibullah Ahan, Heki, Commandant of the Sarhad Amnieh (Levies), was sent with an armed force to xJLndi to arrest Sardar Jiand Ahan and his associates. The refugees were sent to Aushki, where they interviewed the Agent to the Governor General and the Political Agent on the 3rd Aovember. They stated that the remainder of their section, some 55 families, were living on ancestral lands near Gwalishtap in Mashkel, on the British side of the border, and they asked the Agent to the Governor General for financial assistance and a refuge in British territory from Persian oppression. The Agent to the Governor General promised that he would refer their case to the Government of India for such representation as they might think fit to make to the Persian Government, and that in the meantime they should live quietly in Mashkel. He told them clearly that they could not be given allowances. 9./9. jNot all the Yarmuhammadzais are in revolt against the Persian aithorities for idr ^Jiubyar ^Lhan, son of the well-known old Damani leader Shahsowar, and Saib Khan, son of Mir xOiharmnad i^han, have gone into iihwash and are reported to have been taken into service in the Amnieh.

Khan Sahib Ida Khan, his brother Mir Lashkar Khan and his two sons Murad Khan and Khudadad Khan were despatched from Khwash under guard to Zahedan on 22nd May 1933, ££ route, it is believed, to Tehran. The ingratitude of the Persians to Idu Khan, without whose whole-hearted advice and assistance they would never have succeeded in defeating Bahram Khan, Baranzai and subduing Persian Baluchistan in 1929, has still further alienated the tribal chiefs. Sheikh Darwish Khan of Bazman, Mir Zaman Khan Bamen and S. Juma Khan, Ismailzai have all protested to the Military Governor and have refused to come in at his summons.(P.Z. 3714/53) COI: F IDS ITIAI (§&gt; Extract from Baluchistan Agency Confidential Diary No. 9 for fortnight ending 15th '£ay, 1933. x x x 13. Transborder .- The arrest of Khan Sahib Mir Ida Shan, Reki, by the Persian Military Governor at Khwash has caused great excitement among Rekis .and others on thi* side of the border. At Kacha on 26th April 1933 the Havildar of the Chagai Levy Garrison, Mir Shah Beg, who is Khan Sahib Ida Khan ! s brother, did his best to persuade the Political Agent to give his blessing to a Baloch revolt against the Persians in the Sarhad. He was told that any attempt by British Rekis to interfere in affairs on the Persian side would be discountenanced.INDEXED 3^7^ Your telegrams Nos. 26 and 28 - Mention will be made of case to Minister for Foreign Affairs when suitable opportunity offers but as he is Persian subjed it is difficult to do much morec Please sand accounts of his career and espec ially of his recent employment and activities by des=&gt; patch Information here is rather fragmentary. ■5* # K° ^ JO ft, . 1361,/ 7 Telegram XX, No,20-S dated (and reed)1st June 1933o From.....=..

It is now reported that Idu Khan Reki, his son Murad Khan, and his elder brother Lashkar Khan of Gwarkoh, have just been arrested at Khwash. Idu Khan has always been in trouble since the new Brigadier, Abbas Khan, arrived, though he was very friendly with the previous Brigadier, Lluhd. Khan. His pay was lately reduced to 40 Tumans a month. Lashkar Khan was suspected of being in possession of 15 rifles, but he denied this and refused to give then up. It is probably on this account that he has now been arrested.1 (P.2. 3576/3?) nQMPIDENTIAL. Extract from Sistan and Kain Consulate Diary for the month of February, 1933. 3.

The file chiefly comprises extracts of intelligence summaries and various diaries (consular, political, confidential) from a number of British officials in the region: the British Consul at Khorasan, Clive Kirkpatrick Daly; the Baluchistan Agency; the British Legation at Tehran. The file covers: intelligence reports on the activities of individuals and tribes in the border region, including Sardar Juma Khan, leader of the Ismailzai tribe; reports of robberies, raids and border infractions; correspondence exchanged between British officials in Persia and the Government of India, dated 1939 and 1940, in response to the beginning of the Second World War, and a perceived ‘weakness of the military situation’ reported by the Political Agent at Chagai, making the region prone to attack from hostile forces through Persia and Afghanistan.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Baluchistan Political Agency</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Consul</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Persia</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Baluchistan</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Occupied territories</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent, Chagai</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Frontiers</topic></subject><subject><topic>Social conflicts</topic></subject><subject><topic>Indigenous populations</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00002a#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
