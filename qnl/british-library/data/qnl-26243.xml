The Ministry of Foreign Affairs bring this matter to the notice of His Majesty’s Legation with the request that they may take steps for the prevention of such flights which make a bad impression on the people of the frontier, and that the result may be communicated as soon as possible*Prom - The Deputy Secretary to the Government oX Tnm^ in the R)reign ana political Department, To - The Counsellor, British Legation, Kabul. f'emoranaum N0.P.47-P/S5.

The matter has been Investigated and it lias been definitely established that no violation of the frontier could have taken place on 27th November 1934. The only flights which were carried out in proximity to the area referred to between 21st November 1934 and 30th November 1934, were two direct flights from Kohat to Parachinar on 26th November 1934. These have been investigated, and it is most unlikely that the frontier was violated. 3.

The Ministry for Foreign Affairs have the honour to inform His Majesty’s Legation that they have made extensive enquiries in regard to the violation reported to them of the boundaries of the villages Koh-i-Nawa, Kunjkal and Barogi, which are in Afghanistan, and the flight over them by 3 British aeroplanes at 7.30 on 23rd August, 1934.

Also information has been received from the Government of the Southern Province that on 23rd November, 1933, two British aeroplanes crossed the frontier and flew for about an hour and a half over Wazhala and Tarezi Tanni?, an area within Afghanistan. As His Majesty's Legation is aware from the numerous communications made by this Ministry, flights by British aeroplanes are still being carried out in spite of all references which have been made on the subject. The attention of His Majesty's Legation is therefore again drawn to the question of these flights and it is trusted that His Majesty's Legation will give a severe warning to the quarters concerned in order to put a definite stop to these flights by British aeroplanes, which are contrary to established usage. * * 38 G.C.-4. ®?

Since Landi Kotal camp is only about 3i miles from the frontier, it is possible that the aircraft entered the three-mile limit.

The Govemraent of India, from whom enquiries have been made in regard to these alleged violations, after careful investigation state that on the 26th July, 1933, two aircraft were employed on photographic survey at a height of 14,000 feet in the area immediately South of that part of the frontier which is alleged to ha'se been violated. One of these aircraft did not approach within ten miles of the frontier, while it is clear from an examination of the photographs that the other, which was in the sir from approximately 8*15 to 10.30 a.m.(Indian time), did not oross the frontier. On the 6th August, 1933, two aircraft were employed on survey photography in the sane area and at the same height. One of these was flying up to the frontier between 10 and 11 a.m.(Indian time), when it may have been2 . within thrae miles of Wazi&amp;n # hut its timings have been oheckod and the photographs in this ease, as well as those of the other aircraft, oonfina the fact that there was no violation of the frontier. On both dears in a^estion the visibility was good and the pilots were familiar with this portion of the country, where the frontier is clearly demarcated by &amp; veiy distinct ridge of hills and a water-sher • The Oovemiaeat of India are therefore satisfied that no actual violation of the frontier took place either on the 26th July or on the 6th August, 19J33. In this connection, His Treaty’s Legation has the honour to remind the Afghan Foreign Offloe that an untrained observer fro® the ground would find considerable difficulty when an aircraft is flying at a height of 14,000 feet in determining whether it is actually overhead or some distance away from him.S'-'V Minute Paper.

Investigations into fli^its made by Royal Air Force during 13th-23rd March show that only one flight, made from Kohat on 22nd i&amp;reh, could possibly have given rise to complaint by Afghan Government of violation of frontier. The aircraft was employed on survey photography at a hei^t of 14,600 feet above sea level. No exposures were, however, made over the frontier, nor is there any photographic evidence that the frontier was violated. 3# The difficulties of an untrained observer determining when an aeroplane flying at a great height is vertically overhead, were explained in paragraph 3 of Foreign and Political Department memorandum No. F.69-F/33, dated the 13th February 1933, and have presumably been communicated to the Afghan Government, On the occasion under reference all evidence available goes to show that no violation took place.Copy of a note No, 244 dated the 15th April, 1933, from His Majesty^ Legation to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Kabul, His Majesty^ Legation has the honour to invite a reference to Note No, 52 dated 23rd March, 1933, from the Afghan Foreign Office regarding a reported violation of the Afghan frontier by a British aeroplane on the 23rd March, The matter was referred to the Government of India who have careltilly investigated all flights carried out by the Royal Air Force in the North West Frontier Province between the 13th and 23rd Larch, This investigation shows that only one flight which was made from Kohat on the 22nd March could possibly have given rise to the report in question. In this instance an aeroplane was engaged in survey photography at a hei^it of 14,500 feet. No photographs however were taken of any territory within Af^ian limits, and all the available evidence goes to show that the frontier was not in fact crossed. The reason for the report made to the Afghan Government in this case appears to be, as was explained in Note No, 244 dated the 21st February from this Legation, the difficulty for an untrained observer of determining the exact position of aircraft \dien flying at a great height.Confidential .

Further investigation confirms that the flights mentioned in the telegram from the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department No. 17-K, dated the 27th January 1933, were executed as stated. The flimits were undertaken for survey purposes, which required the taking of pin-point photographs of two control strips both in the neighbourhood of Chaman, on the Indian side of the frontier; and all the photographs taken include points marked out on the ground bjyr the Survey Company. f**om this and the reports of the pilots, it seems clear that the frontier was not crossed. Moreover, both pilots had been warned beforehand to exercise great care not to allow their aircraft to cross the frontier, and clear flying conditions prevailed at the time. 3. The aircraft were compelled to fly at 15,000 feet and would in consequence have been visible for some distance on the far side of the border. It would have been almost impossible for an untrained ground observer to determine when an aircraft flying at this height was vertically overhead. 4. It is requested that, if His Majesty’s Minister sees no objection, the Afghan Government may be informed accordingly. 5.

Moreover, both pilots had been warned beforehand to exercise great care not to allow their aircraft to cross the frontier. For the purpose of taking photographs, the aircraft were compelled to fly at a height of 16,000 feet, from where they would have been visible for some distance on the Afghan side of the border. As it would have been almost impossible for an untrained ground observer to determine when an aircraft xymg at this hei^it was vertically overhead, it is most probable that the report received by the Afghan Government that the frontier had been violated was due to a mistake in observation./. &gt;V?f 5 MA'f ^ ^ r&gt; ^rom Foreign, Sew Beltii.

I have the honour to inform Your Excellency that on September 11 at about 10.30 a.m. a British aeroplane inadvertently crossed the Afghan border in the neighbourhood of Spinwam, in North Waziristan. From reports received from the Government of India it appears that the pilot was flying from Kohat to Miranshah. On reaching Kot Mir A&amp;bar near Spinwam he mistook his direction owing to bad visibility, and followed the course of the Kaitu river across the Afghan border. After about 10 minutes flying he realised his mistake and turned back. I have the honour to convey to Your Excellency the deep regret of His Majesty’s Government for this unintentional violation of the Afghan border, and to inform you that disciplinary action is being taken by the Government of India in regard to this case with the intention of still further impressing on all pilots the necessity for stringent observance of the orders issued by them on this subject.Prom Government of India* Foreign and Political Department to Hie Britannic Majesty 9 s Minister at Kabul end repeated by former to Secretary of (COPIES State for India, XXX CIRCULA.TSD) Dated Simla* 23rd September* 193X« Peoeived 23rd September, 1931* X c 45 2 373- S c Addressed to Kabul 36X^K P repeated to Secretary of State for India, Corraspondence ending with our telegram of the 19th instant, 356-K, From further enquariec made* it appears tiiac pilot was thoroughly familiar with topography of frontier.

These complaints have been carefully investigated by the Government of India, with the following results (i) The report received by Your Excellency of a British aeroplane crossing the frontier in the neighbourhood of Asmar on December 16, 1930, is unfortunately confirmed as correct but presumably refers to December 15, Two aeroplanes were flying together to Drosh in Chitral limits on that day. The pilot of one of these lost sight of the other and thinking that the latter was in difficulties turned out of his course to look for this machine. During this operation he inadvertently crossed the Afghan frontier. (ii) The report regarding the appearance of an aeroplane over Kam Dakka on February 18, 1931, has been found to be incorrect, since clouds were low and visibility was bad on that day, on which no machines were flying near the Afghan frontier in the area mentioned. (iii) The report regarding a violation of the frontier in the neighbourhood of Asmar on May 18, 1931, has been found by the Government of India after careful investigation to be incorrect. No aeroplanes were flying in this neighbourhood on that date, but on the following day (i.e.May 19) three aeroplanes flewfrom Risalpur to Drosh and 'back. Uone of these is found to have crossed the frontier, and it seems possible thf^t the report received by Your Excellency was due to one of these aeroplanes flying at a greater height than the rest and so being visible at a greater distance. The untrpined observer, as Your Excellency is aware, often thinks that an aeroplane which is flying high, although in reality far away, is directly over himself. In regard to the only one of these reports which has been confirmed as correct, that of a violation on December 16, 1930, I have the honour to express the sincere regret of His Majesty T s Government and to assure Your Excellency that stringent precautions are being taken by the Government of India to minimise the possibility of such unfortunate incidents in future. To myself it is a matter for regret that in your letter of Jtine 27, Your Excellency should have thought it necessary to use expressions which are not usually employed on the strength of an unconfirmed report, and which, even if such a report were true, appear scarcely appropriate to an occurrence of a kind which, as Your Excellency is well aware, could only be unintentional, and is nowadays not infrequent on any international frontier near which flying is practised.BY AIS HAIL Copy of Headquartsrg Mo, X (Indian; Croup letter K=. ta/S^t/AJM*U dated ?tii Ally Xo3X. r 4T. 3 1 JUL195’ /nr'i 1/ Alleged Tloliition of the Afghan Frontier# \J of 3rd Juty# the ettaoned reports by flight Lieutenant Collingnood and Lexgeent Thaaas are formrded# 2# the Of floor Commanding Bo# 2 (Indian) Wing Station states that he has been unable to obtain a statement trm Sergeant Jarred, ae he Is at present on leave* His report is, however, of no oonsequenoe. as he was in the company of Flight Lieutenant Colllngwood throughout the flight to Prosh and basic# 3# It is possible that Sergeant Thoa&amp;g in&amp;dvertently violated the Afghan Border after becoming separated front the foxmtion, although he ia conversant with the route and says he did not# Further evidence on this point Is not available, as 4# in the absence of proof or further details further to this Headquarters Signal V&amp; he was flying with ballast# regarding the violation te#g» time, single aircraft or not) which njay make tue present evidence oiroumstantlal, no disciplinary action has been taken against Sergeant Thomas# ENCLOSURE IN INDIA r 0 «T:IQN '.0P C TA , 'Y , 8 | Dated 20 JUL. 1931 Reoi'.i ,.: , 29-iUL. 19311 tho honour to outomit the following report on ay flight to Xaroah on 13th i&amp;f'# 13^1« 2 # The object of the flight we to fly Captain Crapp» tbe Aeeietant Politioal Agent» Chltrul from Chaicdarra to 13ro»h and the opportunity was also taken to carry out the Quarterly latuling Ground Inspection# 3# On the outward journey the weather wae clear and the e^y cloudleee# The Laorai P&amp;»« wae oroeeed without difficulty# The formation flew over Chitral in order that Gap tain Cropp oight drop a meeeage and then landed at Daresh# T-ie aircraft resmined on the t pround for about one hour# whi 3e the landing ground wee inspected during wtilch ti:ae tne weather deteriorated* 4# formation which ooneieted of three aircraft had beun led by Pilot Sergeant xtiQiu&amp;ti on the outward flight* ae 1 had not bean to Proeh before* X decided to keep the same positions in the formation on tiie return journey* ^han the fostation «&amp;&amp; ready to take off at hroah a thunderstorm broke over the landing ground but as it looked clearer towards the l&amp;or&amp;i Fase# 1 decided to proceed# 1 gave verbal instructions to Serge an to Thocme and Jarred the pilots of the other two aircraft to return to hroah if the Pass was closed by clouds# After taking off* recant ‘Ihcms outflow and oa to limbed the other two aircraft and* by the tlna we reached the Pass with enough height to cross* X estimated him to be naif a mile ahead and 1000 feet higher# a there was considerable cloud over tie la oral Pass and it looked as though it might becomebeoom© closed sltogether* Sergeant Jarred and 1 turned to arose It and did not follow Sergeant thomae any further* Very soon after turning for the Pass* Sergeant Thomas ran Into a ralnstorn and we loet sight of him* The remainder of the formation orossed the pees In a nail atom and emerged into clear weather on the other side* Seeing no sign of Sergeant 'Jhoa**g and toinhlng he had probably returned to Drear*, 1 proceeded to ChaJcdarra and landed, to enable Sergeant Jarred to drop hi s paft&amp;engtir* After fitting Sergeant Jarred'a aeroplane with ballaftt, we returned to Rlsalp?ar to find th&lt;?t sergeant Thome had l&amp;nded 10 rdrmtes before* 5# Sergeant Thorari® Informed me that he crossed the letorai laae before u* and welted ower Dir* Hot seeing u» at Dir, he flew to Chalcdarra and waited there and still being unable to pick up the remainder of the formation, returned to Blealpur* 0# Meitner Sergeant Jhrred or 1 left the recognised route on either the outward or return journey*i ■ r/!

On May 4 I received a personal letter from Faiz Muhammad which ended- rt I remind you once more as to the question of offering an aeroplane for a present,about which a promise has already been given rt . I replied to this letter personally on May 6, and pointed out that the offer in question was made for particular reasons and in particular circumstances, which no longer existed, and that I could not be held to the fulfilment of an offer made eight months before, and about which I had heard nothing whatever during that period. I gave him to understand, as suggested in my demi-official letter of September 27, quoted above, that this offer wes no longer open. On May 16 I drew the Prime Ministers attention to certain methods of the Foreign Minister in the transaction of business, vhich might lead to misunderstanding and misrepresentation of my attitude towards requests made by the Afghan Government. These methods were:- (a) misquotation of statements made by me in oral conversation, and representing promises to refer as promises to comply; (b) failure to give adequate notice of requirements such as visas, facilities,etc. a glaring instance of shich was that of Ghulam Siddiq*s recent journey) (c) requests for executive action by the Government of India in judicial cases, and, (d) the line taken in this particular case of acknowledging an offer, somewhat curtly, at the time it was made and asking for it to be fulfilled eight months later. ENCLOSURE IN i INDIA FOREIGN SECR CT Ar'v , S Letter No i?S M. Dated 4 JLifo. 1331 2LJUN.1931 TheTirxe Prime Minister said he had no douht that the Foreign Minister had, as a matter, of fact forgotten all about the offer of the aeroplane, and had not intended either to be uncivil or to bounce me* I went on to sa/ that the Afghan Government were oi course at liberty to reconsider and cancel any requests they might make before any action had been taken towards meeting such requests, but they should not consider that, if they chose to leave such questions open without a definite indication of their wishes, they could remain open “till the resurrection”. As an instance oi what X meant, I cited the request by the Afghan Government for the repair of their aeroplanes by India, and said that, although the Government of India had expressed their readiness to give the Afghan Government assistance in this direction, I had heard no thing definite further from the latter, and perhaps they had decided not to pursue the proposal. That as of course a matter for their own decision entirely,but they should not assume that the request would be complied with at any time that they chose to renew it. I was careful not to show any particular interest or anxiety as regards the repair of the Afghan machines, and passed on without waiting for the Prime Minister*s reply, to other topics.

His majesty's Minister, Kabul.Translation of a Note To.110, dated 6th Ramal 1310, (corresponding to 29th March 1931) from the Afghan Foreign Office, to His Majesty^ Legation, Kabul* With reference to His Britannic Majesty’s Legation memorandum Ho*244 of the 6th January, the Afghan Foreign Office has the honour to state that according to information received by the Afghan Foreign Office, on the 24th jius (16th December 1930) at 10 a.m* a British aeroplane passed over M Darra-i-Seen rt at a height of about 500 metres and flew over the Military Training School in Asmar limits. Another aeroplane at 11 a.m. on the 29th Dalv (18th February 1931) appeared above ’’Kama Dakfca' flying over Afghanistan from the direction of Shilman. The above is communicated to the respected Legation so that the authorities concerned may be informed and steps ta&gt;:en to prevent further aerial violations (of the frontier) in future. Although the respected Legation has several times been informed of such violations and has definitely promised to stop them, still it appears from the above information that British aeroplanes continue to fly over Afghan territory. His Britannic Majesty's Legation is requested, in contrast to what has been done on previous occasions, kindly to pay due attention to the above, and prevent for the future theseaerial violations (of the frontier) which are contrary to law and which arouse feelings of resentment in the minds of the people of Afghanistan.No. 18 His Majesty’s iCublil presents his compliments to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and has the honour to transmit herewith a copy of the undermentioned paper.

On .ocember 13th, 1930 the Air Btaff Officer, ; o.2(Indian) wing Station informed mo verbally that a quantity of petrol was to bo flown from BISALPUB TC KAIA DB03H ani asked me to undertake the delivery of Uiia.

On December 16th the weather was good and at 0910 hours, Flight doutenant LEA-COX and Sgt. KENNEDY proceeded in forma tion, the latter carrying Flying Offioer 3TA&amp;G, the Stores Offioer as passenger. At 1230 hours. Flight lieutenant L8A-G0X returned to HI3ALPUB, and reported in me that he had delivered his load of petrol at KALA DK03H but that Sgt. KBNKBDY had parted company with him before arriving at KALA UBGSH and that, as he had not been seen since, it was thought that he had returned to BXSAXJPtB* I docided to wait until the limit of endurance of Sgt. U8KXD7 # 9 aircraft ha 1 Doen VMrtMi ialrtJH action and at 1310 hours, the aircraft returned to 31 SAL?BE* Sgt» X3HNXD1 reported that he had lost sight of Flight lieutenant XXAX Li A-COX and and, thinking ho was in trouble had searched for him. I investigated the circulartarcen at once and admonishod Dgt. KiiHHKDX severely for allowing himself to lose sight of his leader and for failing to reach KALA UStOSS, more espocially as he had been there lefore. I was not, however, aware then that ho had entered the six mile prohibited zone. Both Filots had studied the new flying zone map with me in my office before leaving and were aware of the six mile limit.I consider that Sgt. KENB&amp;DY showed a lack of a inaanahip in loainr, his leader and. as stated above, have wtowag atlmonishod him severely for this. His subseQLuent movements, however, appear to he due to ^ a natural anxiety as to the safety of his leader which caused him to lose himself temporarily. Ifoe village of Ml iKHAH on the main road which the aircraft pass over after crossing the imjma PASS is harely six miles from the AKEAS BOHDBB and, if 3gt« KKNNiiDY f s aircraft was the one reportol as being observed from Bia&amp;QT on December 15th, the infringement must have occurr&lt;^d shortly after 3gt.

I continued in th&lt; direction of the Pass and notice that Sgl.KENKDT was drfit- ing off to my left and was about 500 feet above me; my heigh* at the time was about 13000 feet above sea level; as ae gave no indication of distress, and had previously been to 1 K&gt;., I instructed my Air 'unner to watch him while I check ed over the route after the pass, which I was then approach* ing. As I was going through the Pass, I asked my Air Gunner if &gt;gt. KKNNBDY was still in sight and he said that he had lost sl&amp;ht of him. I continued, and landed at DBGiH at 1030 hours. I left DBC H at 1115 hours and as Sgt. KSNNKDY had not turned up, 1 returned to BI3AXPUB by the road route, as I thought that dgt. KENNEDY would make for the road if he was in trouble.

MEMORANDUM. lam directed to communicate for your information and gui lance the following revised provisional instructions for flying in the tribal areas in the North West Frontier, in supersession of those issued in memorandum No. 14/24/P. C./53, dated 3 January 1924!: — 1. All flying is prohibited within six miles of the Durand Line. 2 . The remaining tribal areas for purposes of flying are divided into four categories :— (а) free and unrestricted zones ; ( б ) areas in which flying can be arranged by the R. A. F. in consulta tion with the local political officers ; (c) areas where the policy of “ nibbling ” accepted by the Government of India can be pursued ; (d) corridors. Flights over the remainder of tribal territory, not include 1 in the above categories, cannot be undertaken without the Chief Commissioner’s express permisssion. 3. The specific areas included in the above categories as are follows: Category (a) — Free zones — (t) Whole of Waziristan. (it) Larga Sherani country. (Hi) The Adam Khel Afridi salient to the east of the Kokat Pass Road. (tv) The Mullagori country in the Khyber Agency as defined by the Khyber Pass and the Kabul River. (t?) The Mohmand country defined as follows:— -From Abazai north-west along the line of the Swat River to the junction of the Swat and Ambahar rivers ; thence in a direot line to Nawagai. AnwA—From Nawagai south-west to a point six miles north-east of llazai peak.-1 2 West —A line six miles east of the presumptive Indo-Afghan frontier, the frontier being defined as follows : — From llazai vid Bedmanai Pass, Yarsar, Sarlara Pass and the Khapak to the Kabul Biver at Sratigga. South—~Dovtrv the Kabul Biver to Michni. __The Mohmand area hfis been added in pursuance of the principle that, when tribal territory has been bombed and freely flown over, flights over that territory s ou ordinarily be maintained as a matter of course when peaceful relations are restored. Category {h) includes — (i) T)ir, Swat and Chitral Agency, . . («») Buner and the adjacent tribal territory under the control ot the Deputy Commissioner, Peshawar, (Hi) The Amb State and the tribal territory under the control of the Deputy Commissioner, Hazara. Flights can be arranged by the B. A. F. over portions of these areas in direct communication with the Political Agent, Malakand, the Deputy Commissioner, Peshawar, and the Deputy Commissioner, Hazara, respectively. The B. A. F. authorities are being requested to abide by such conditions and restrictions as may be imposed by these officers, who will communicate without delay for the information of the Chief Commissioner, the grant or refusal of permission together with such restrictions as have been imposed when flights are permitted. Category (c)— “.Nibbling” areas cannot be exactly defined, but it is inteuded that political officers, with a view to the further extension of flying rights over tribal territory, should pursue a policy of vigorous “nibbling . ouch flights can only be undertaken when a political officer is carried, and require the Chief Commissioner’s express permission in the case of any new extension of the flying area. The general object may also be pursued by arranging flights lor local Maliks and by such other measures as may suggest themselves. Category (d) — Corridors — The following main routes have now been established by usage and ire now formally authorised : Boute (*)—From Dargai to Chakdarra and thence to Chitral. Boute (it )—From Peshawar to Jamrud and thence to Land! Kotal. Boute (iit)—From Peshawar to Kohat. , ^ . Boute (iv )—From Landi Kotal to All Masjid and thence to Kohat. Bou f e fcl—From Peshawar to Hangu, from Hangu to Kahi, and from Kahi to Arawali. Except in the case of routes (ii) and (m), both of which adjoin free zones 3 n one side of the line of flights, all flights between the points indicated should jq direct, and there should be no reconnaissance without special permission. 4 In issuin'* these revised instructions the Chief Commissioner once more desires to impress on all officers concerned the lm ' ,or ^^ e of ^° S0 liaison between political officers on the one hand and the it. A. J). on the other. The success of the policy hangs largely on its patient enforcement 11 sue manner as gradually to accustom the tribesmen to the more frequent appear- ance of aeroplanes over their territory and to preclude the raising of the question of trans-frontier Bights as a direct issue between any tribe and the Civil Administration. The question of extending the “ permissive zone” in the “nibbling areas” will he reviewed at a later date. L. W.

With reference to Notes Nos. 5/^38 and 5906 / 5089 , dated the 2nd October and 25rd November, 1930, respectively, from the Afghan Foreign Office on the subject of the violation of the Afghan frontier by British aeroplanes. His Britannic Majesty^ Legation has the honour to state that enquiries have been made with the following results (1) . No British aeroplane crossed the Afghan frontier on the 5^ August (corresponding to 15 th Sunbla). (2) . It appears probable that on October 26th (corresponding to Jrd Aqrab), a British aeroplane inadvertently crossed the Afghan border near Kafirdana Sar. (5). No infringement of the Afghan border appears to have occurrea on November 6th (corresoondi ng to the il|.th Aqrab). (!(.). On November llfth (correspond! ng to 22nd Aqrab), a British aei»oplane did cross the Afghan border near Landikhana- the pilot having mistaken his position- and flew northwards as far as Loe Dakka. On discovering his mistake, he turned Eastwards and flew along the line of the Kabul river to the Indian border. His Britannic Majesty^ Legation is directed to convey to the Afghan G-overnment an expression of the sincere regret of His Britannic Majesty^ Government for the probable or actual violation of the Afghan frontier by British aeroplanes, as noted above, and to state that necessary measures are being taken to prevent the recurrence of such unfortunate incidents.2 Secret h indexed No.ia/S4/i/Alr*l yrom To Headquartersi ** Ko*l(Indian)Group* PJ /* Royal Air ^oroe.

The Afghan Foreign Office has the honour to inform His Britannic Majesty’s Legation that roports are continually being received of British aeroplanes entering Afghan territory, nanely, on the 14th Aqrab {6th Hovomber) an aeroplane marked Ho.10 red (CB) flew very low over the military post, Shamshad, from the direction of the Tirah border and crossed towards Lawargi, and again on the 22nd Aqrab (14th November) it flew so low over the Shamshad hills and Afghan military posts that all marks on it were clearly visible. The Afghan Foreign Office therefore has the honour to inform His Britannic Majesty^ Legation of the facts and to request it to prevent these movements of aeroplanes which are contrary to the desire of both parties, and to give the Afghan Foreign Office a firm assurance in this regard at an early date. Although the matter has been discussed several times with His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, who promised to have such activities checked, yet so far nothing has resulted and these flights have not been prevented. Flights (over Afghan territory) have now been made on several occasions. His Britannic Majesty's Legation is requested to assure the Afghan Foreign Office as early as possible that aeroplanes will not again fly over the Afghan frontier.8342/30 24th December, 1930.

The Afghan Foreign Office has the honour to inform His Britannic Majesty’s Legation that, according to information received, two British aeroplanes crossed the border at Salman Kand (Kam Shilman?), flew over Kam DafcJca , the river, Qarya Rina, Palosai Mach ttegi and the neighbouring hills, situated in Afghan territory and then crossed towards Khwaezai Mohmand country in Independent Mohmand territory. Baring the earlier part of this year and before the British Legation arrived in Kabul, on one or two occasions British aeroplanes violated the frontier. The Afghan Consul-General, Delhi, represented these violations of the frontier to the'India Foreign Office which there upon issued strict orders to the Royal Air Force stationed on the frontier. In spite of this however it has occurred again, and the Afghan Foreign Office has the honour to inform His Britannic Majesty’s Legation of the fact and to request that it will take strong measures to prevent further aerial violations of the frontier. It is further requested that enquiries may kindly be made as to how, in spite of the strict orders issued, the present incident occurred, and the result communicated to the Afghan Foreign Office.Cojjy or a memorandum Ho. 244» dated the 9th October, 1930, from His Majesty’s Minister, Kabul, to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, Simla© from the Afghan Foreign Ministry, Ho. 3113/2438, dated the 2nd October, 1930, regarding an alleged violation of Afghan territory by two British aeroplanes.

Squadron, Royal Air Force, Peshawar, dated Peshawar, the 21st June 1930 (Confidential) I have the honour to submit the following report of my forced landing in Afghanistan on 17th June 1930. At 09-55 hours on 17th June 1930, I left Peshawar Aerodrome to carry out a reconnaissance of the MOHMAND country. My Air Gunner was No. 353538, L. A. C. ATT WELL, F. At 11-30 hours 1 had practically completed my patrol and was over LAGHAM. I continued my patrol of tracks, observing considerable move ment of cattle, into the interior of MOHMAND Country. I noticed the visibility was beginning to lessen, a thick haze gradually blotting out the plain. At about 11-45 hours, whilst flying to the WEST of LAGHAM, I noted the visibility as poor and set a course direct for PESHAWAR. On the way the visibility became less and I had to avoid a thunder-storm. To the EAST, visibility was now nil, but to the WEST it was good. At approximately 12-10 hours, in avoiding some high ground which suddenly appeared, I flew further WEST than I intended. I could not see the ground below me, but to the WEST I could see part of a river and a plain. My petrol was now running short and rather than risk a forced landing in bad visibility amongst the hills, I returned to the plain and landed on some ground which was fairly good, beside a large village on the main road. When I had landed three men with rifles came out and spoke to my Air Gunner and myself. As neither of us could speak PUSHTU we could not make them understand. Several other men came up, and one man (mounted) pointed towards the village. They were not hostile. After some discussion two other men pointed -A107 in the same direction as if they wanted us to go there. We tried to tell them that we could not leave the aircraft unguarded, they understood and two tribesmen with _ rifles and bandoliers were detailed to keep the crorvd back and look after the air- craft. Meanwhile, we were taken under escort to the village, through it, then past another collection of mud houses, down to a grass covered structure, beside the river, where we were met by the Malik, who shook hands and provided chairs for us to sit on. On discovering that we did not know the language, the Malik and the main body withdrew, and left us with a guard of two tribesmen, the village writer and three boys ; sons of the Malik. They were very interested in the flying topees and goggles, also in trying to speak with us. No hostility was shown. The Malik and main body returned with a taxi-driver, a British Indian, named MOHD. ASLAM, who was driving a bus from PESHAWAR to KABUL. He acted as interpreter but his English was not very good. The questions asked first of all were, “ Why did you land here ?”, “ \\ here have you come from ?”, I answered both questions, but the Malik was still unceitain. At about 14-00 hours we were taken back to the village where the Malik telephoned to JALALABAD. I spoke on the telephone to an Indian Doctor who was acting as Interpreter. He asked why we had landed, who we were, what was in the aircraft, where we came from, names of pilot and passenger and ranks. 1 he dust-storm was raging at the time and communication was difficult. The authorities at Jalalabad were anxious about our reception by the country people and asked if we were having any trouble. About 15-00 hours the Customs Officer from DARK A, accompanied by the local Police Lieutenant and Afghan army escort arrived at the village. They brought an interpreter, who spoke English, and again I w r as asked the same ques ts ons. This interpreter told me that the country people thought we were Russians, and were not very keen about us. After some discussion, during which our lunch arrived, the interpreter told us not to be worried, everything would be done to make us comfortable, and instructions have been received from JALALABAD that all couitesy and civility must be given. We were asked whether we would like to stay in the village with its rather primitive comforts, or go to JALALABAD. I said that we would stay in the village near the aircraft. I then asked for pickets and rope to tie down the aircraft. These w ere produced and we all went over to where the aircraft was standing. The Customs Officer from DAKKA made a list of all the articles in the aircraft which included a Lewis gun, three fully loaded drums of ammunition, wireless, and all loose components (see Appendix ‘ C ’)• These were handed over to the Malik of the vil lage for safe custody. Assistance was then given in tying down the aircraft. After tying down was completed, the Customs Officer and escort left for DAKKA again, reassuring us that we should be well treated. We then returned to the village under escort where we were taken to the Malik’s house and where chairs were provided. All the members of the household gathered round to look at us, including the three boys who again tried to speak with us. They played with ATTWELL, who was successful in answering them by writing English and mentioning names of Cities which they recognised. They knew the names of LONDON, BERLIN, CALCUTTA and BOMBAY. PESHAWAR was familiar. Each boy had a torch light and fountain pen, made in Germany. One child took the rifle from a tribes man guard and tried to do arms-drill. He then asked ATTWELL and myself to do arms drill, which we did ; but they were not satisfied. They wanted me to give the orders and ATTWELL to carry them out; this he did in a most creditable manner, making quite an impression. From the time of the arms-drill, the general atmosphere was much easier, due, I think, to the discovery that we could handle arms, and must be soldiers and not civilians. One tribesman had been in KOHAT, and knew the words of command and movements. The atmosphere was now definitely friendly. Although no hos tility had been shown, the first feelings (apait from the children) had been rather distant. The Malik now returned and greeted us, sitting down and calling for tea. Later in the evening we were taken with the Malik and household to the roof, where we were again provided with chairs. If anything we asked for procurable, it was quickly produced. About 22-30 hours we had supper and about 23-00 hours, afterplaying a game of cards with two of the boys, beds were brought and placed in a favourable position so that we should be shaded from the early sun. We went to bed at 23-30 hours. In the morning the household rose early and carried out their usual routine. Water was brought to us, and later the Malik had breakfast with us ; he did not eat but drank tea. At about 10-00 hours we all moved down to the river bank, where we again occupied the grass-covered hut where it was very cool. We were allowed to walk about as much as we liked but two guards were always in attendance. Rifles were of various patterns, from old carbines to Mk. Ill Lee-Enfields, Russian 1925 and French (1889). The cartridges were always carried in belts or bandoliers. Again great interest was shown in drill movements and the boys tried to make the tribesmen do arms-drill. About 11-00—12-00 hours a messenger from Colonel Carstin arrived with my bearer, and kit for L. A. C. ATTWELL and myself (includ ing bedding). My bearer now acted as interpreter through two Sikhs who lived in another village and were anxious to be helpful. In the afternoon charpoys were provided and we slept in the grass hut with the Malik and the guards. Tea was brought at about 17-00 hours. At about 19-00 we were allowed to swim in the river. We used our shorts as bathing costumes. At about 19-45 we were told that we must come into the village, which we did. We proceeded to the roof where more tea was produced, later a band played which consisted of a hand piano, one stringed instrument and a drum. Supper at about 23-00 hours. Our own bedding was laid on the charpoys in the same position as the previous night. The following morning (June 19th) a considerable amount of telephoning was going on and at about 09 • 00 hours we were informed that we must get ready to go to Jalalabad. My bearer was most anxious not to be left in the village. All kit was packed and we left in a Peshawar-Kabul bus at about 11-00 hours after bidding farewell to the Malik and his officers. We inspected the aircraft before leaving ; it was correct. The road to Jalalabad was very rough with indifferent surface and no repaired bridges over the water courses. We arrived at JALALABAD at about 14-00 hours. There we were taken to the Local Government offices, where we were pro\ided with beds and rooms. Lunch was produced at about 15-30 hours after which we slept. In the evening we were permitted to swim in a large ornamental fountain. The Secretary for Foreign Affairs interviewed us (an Indian Doctor attached to the Government offices acting as interpreter). We were again asked the usual questions, and told to ask for anything which we required and report any thing which was not to our liking. It was explained that Jalalabad had been burned during the troubles and apologies were made for not providing better quarters. At about 23-00 hours, supper was served, and our beds were laid outside beside a tank. The Afghan army provided an escort which was not at all obvious and carried out its duties without interfering or being unduly visible. On the morning of the 20th June, Major Parsons and Major Elliot, from the British Legation. Kabul, visited us, and told us that we must return to Peshawar that day. Permission to fly the aircraft out of the country had not yet been obtained. We travelled in the Legation transport to Landi Khana where we transferred to a taxi- bus which took us to Brigade Headquarters at Landi Kotal where we had lunch. Brigade Headquarters provided transport to Peshawar.109 APPENDIX ‘A\ Note 2. —On ~19th June 1930. — The large building in which we were quartered in JALAL ABAD had been partly destroyed during the recent trouble in Afghanistan, and is at present being re-built (in parts) and re-decorated. The gardens are in good condition with many orna mental and fruit trees, but parts of the gardens have been destroyed Two armoured cars of Italian manufacture were standing in a conservatory in the gardens, the tyres w T ere very bad and the cars had the appearance of being unused. Note 3. Whilst leav:ng JALALABAD we passed a company of machine-guns mounted on mules. The guns were on their ground mountings ready to be lifted off before coming into action. The type of gun was unfamiliar with a pistol grip at the operating end Note 4.—The Afghan Atony seemed generally contented and friendly. Note 5.—The Aerodrome about 4 miles from JALALABAD still possesses a good surface but rather indistinct markings. The small hangar has been destroyed Note 6. W hen the authorities in JALALABAD were informed that we were short of cigarettes and matches, they despatched a horseman who brought some packets of ‘ SCISSORS * cigarettes and some boxes of SWEDISH Fuzee matches all the way by road. 21st J une 1930.

He said that he was surprised to hear that 200 or more men had been killed by machine guns in Peshawar. Seemingly he did not want to believe it. He praised the British Government but was surprised to hear of such action. I told him the correct number was about 20. He also spoke about British soldiers patrolling the streets of Peshawar ready to bayonet any Indian who did not do exactly as instructed. I told him that this informal tion was incorrect. 21zt J une 1930. (Sd.) R. MENZIES, Flight Lieutenant, R. A. F. APPENDIX ‘ C '. List of equipment handed over for safe custody :— One Lewis Gun.

Subject :— Report of forced lauding of Flight Lieutenant R. Menzies in Afghanistan on 17th June 1930. I have the honour to submit the following report of Flight Lieutenant IN Menzies’ forced landing in Afghanistan on 17th June 1930. I was wireless air gunner to Flight Lieutenant Menzies. M c left 1 eshawar at 09-55 hours on 17th June 1930 to carry out the usual MOHMAND patrol. For about 90 mins, we reported by W/T movements observed on the tracks from point R. 1988 to LAGHAM and NAHAKKI. When over NAHAKKI, I informed my pilot that signals from the ground station at Peshawar were too weak to read, he turned and made for Peshawar, visibility ahead at this point was poor and was getting worse in the form of a thick mist. * I occasionallv glanced at the compass and thought we were on the right coursi, by now it was impossible to see any land-marks. My pilot continued his course and was O. K. until we ran into a thunder-storm which completely blotted out the surrounding landscape. During this time I tried to resume W/T communication with Peshawar but the storm made conditions impossible for W/T working. When we came out of the storm and could see the ground below, it was not familiar, and the petrol was running out, we looked out for a place to land. Ahead . appeared a road with telegraph poles running along side, my pilot made a good landing on some rough ground about 150 yds. from the road. All that happened after is told in Flight Lieutenant MENZIES’ report with which I concur. While in the village of BASAWAL we were treated with courtesy and respect and all our wants attended to. After one or two incidents they became very friendly. At JALALABAD also they did everything for our ease and comfort. At no time was any hostility shown.

It will he observed that the machine is an obsolete pattern of D.H.9j the airframe is worthless, the engine of doubtful value, and certain parts are missing. The repre sentatives of the Afghan Government who examined the machine agreed that it was useless and should be disposed of as scrap. If this is done, the total amount realised will probably be leas than Rs. 200/-. If the airframe is scrapped and the engine is sent to Peshawar for conveyance to Kabul, the cost of freight alone will amount to Re. 584, which considerably exceeds the value of the engine. It is suggested, therefore, that, if you see no objection, the Afghan Government may be advised to dispose oi t»ie machine as scrap.tLxJ- 4&lt; X ssm to point out howevei^the Royal Air iorce in India are in proceas of re-equipping their Squadrons with •Vapiti aircraft and have a number of surplus ».H. 9 a which they are selling at scrap value lapproxiiaat.ely Rs. 250 per machine complete).

He triinks that this would convey a sense of goodwill without giving rise to any possible embarrassment which might be connected with a free gift* The Government of India would have no objection to this, if you agree, but are inclined to think that it would be better to make the offer as a free gift in the name of His Majesty’s Government* Sd* £*B.

Previous Papers :— 3997 b 2000 10.29 AFGHANISTAN : Forced landing of a British aeroplane sii Afghan territory between Dakka and Jalalabad. Copy of to FOR INFORMATION t Please see telegrams below about the R.A.F. aeroplane which came down in Afghan territory, which speak for themselves. It seems unnecessary to send any instructions from this end: Mr. Maconachie will no doubt by now have taken whatever action is possible on the strength of the Government of India’s telegrams to him. The Foreign OffipS concur in this view. It appears from the Afghan Precis (paragraphs 559 and 543) that frequent complaints on this subject (violation of the Afghan frontier by British aeroplanes) have been received from the Afghan Government, and some actual violations have occurred. The most conspicuous of these were the landing of a British aeroplane at Katawaz in 1921, (on this/this occasion the Afghans released the pilots but retained the machine); the bombing of the Tazi (Chel in 1923, and of Mangals in Afghan territory from Nushki. Other instances of less importance were violations at Torkham on 12th February, 1925, and from Chaman on 28th February, 1925. In May 1926 Mahmud Tarzi expressed concern at what he termed persistent violation of Afghan territory by British aeroplanes. (L+r. In December 1927 one of the A aeroplanes escorting King Amanullah made a forced landing near Chaman. Under instructions from His Majesty the aeroplane and its crew were immediately released. The above are the more important instances of British aeroplanes landing in Afghanistan. The only instance of an Afghan aeroplane making a forced landing m British territory occurred in May 1928, when an aeroplane with Russian airmen came dom in the Kurram valley. On this occasion the fullest assistance was given to the Afghan Government, and the aeroplane and its personnel were taken to the frontier and were there left in charge of an Afghan pilot. Warm expressions of thanks were received from the Afghan Government. This may form a useful precedent if (which it is to be hoped will not be the case) the Afghans show any disposition to make difficulty over the present incident. pFSt£ 7 Pro 0 hi c v\J 2(/6/j6 HG/aWc {60 groups) COPY Off TBLBORA M. 3825 U' From (COPIES CIRCULATED) Viceroy^ Foreign &amp; Political Department, to Secretary of State for India*repeating telegram addressed to Kabul* Dated - Simla, 19th June, 1930 o Received 19th June, 1930, 5,32 p.m* — XXX IMPORT APT , Addressed to Kabul 94~K, repeated to Secretary of state for India and Horth West Frontier Province, It is understood that machine is unaa-naged- and could be flown away, if it could be supplied oil and-patrol.

D.473S-F/36 dated 18th December, 1936 on the subject of the recent violf tion by an aeroplane of the Afghan frontier ? 2. I have addressed the Afghan Government on the subject in &amp; letter which is being forwarded to you tinder cover of ray endorsement despatch No. 1 dated 2nd January, 1937, and will endeavour to &amp;ake the best of a bad job should the subject come up, as it may, in conversation with Afghan Ministers. There are however one or two points about the future to which I would like to draw your attention. 3. A reference is made In your Express Letter to the •inexperience 1 of the pilot. Presuming as I do that the Royel Air Force would not allow inexperienced pilots to fly anywhere near the border If they could help it, the reference suggests that there may be more than one inexperienced pilot flying machines within reach of the Durtnd line, and that in spite of all efforts we may look for a repetition of these incidents. 4. This is pcrticularly unfortunate at the present time when we are doing our utmost to persuade the Afghan Government to base their new Air Force on British foundations. However difficult it may be to Sir Aubrey Metcalfe, KCIF.,C£I.,MVO., Foreign Secretary to the Government of Indie in the Foreign and Political Department.2 tvold trespassing across the frontier, it is not eesy to convince the ley Afghan mind of this fact, particulrrly when the trespass covers e long stretch of the Kunar river, well inside the Afghan boundary* The effect must be to raise considerable doubts whether our system of training is in such circumstances worth following# 5. The other point is that if these violations continue Afghan exasperation may quite possibly lead to deliberate counter violations as soon as the Afghan Air Force has learnt to fly r-ny distance from Kabul# We will in any case almost certainly get violations from the Afghan side, due to inexperience and poor maps, and we should be in a much better position to protest against them if we had a clean sheet ourselves# 6* I sm sending e copy of this letter to Walton and Collier# Yours sincerely.

According to a reliable report received from the Eastern Province a British aeroplane was seen coining from the direction of Bajaur at 9.40 s.m. the 17th Aqrab 1215 Sh&amp;msi (9.11.56). The aeroplane continued its flight towards Sar and M rrur and passed over Chigha Serai and D&amp;rra-i-pech, and returned by the same route. The Afghan border was penetrated to a depth of approximately 50 miles and this violation of Afghan territory lasted for one hour and ten minutes. My Government has protested in the past and again records Its protest against these flights which violate the frontier and are In contravention of International practice and neighbourly relations* As I have repeatedly informed Your Excellency these successive violations of Afghan territory have not ceased In spite of fssurances received from His Majesty’s Legation from time to time.

Reference correspondence ending with your Memorandum No. £44 dated the £lst November, 1936. 2. The violation reported is ccnfirmed. The pilot of an aircraft engaged in photography of points within twelve miles radius of Koh-i-Mohr lost himself and appears to have crossed the frontier at approximately 10.25 hours, recrossing it at approximately 13.12 hours. It is probable that the route taken was Lakra Sar - Shinkora - north-east along the Xunar River to Asinf r - returning by the same route. The pilot had recently arrived In India, and wes inexperienced and unacquainted with the Frontier. If you see no objection, would you kindly convey to the Afghan Government the greet regret of the Government of India for the incident and inform them that disciplinary action is being taken against those responsible for it ? It will perhaps be sufficient to explain that the pilot lost his way and to make no reference to his inexperience. You might add that the Government of India will do all they can to prevent a repetition of the incident.(Enclosure 3 to Kabul despatch No* 1 dated 2nd January, 1937) • . * 6 43 Copy of personal letter No. 2/P dated L'nd January, 1937, from His Majesty 1 s Minister, Kabul to the acting Minister for Foreign Affairs. Fith reference to Your Excellency’s letter Nc. 2824 dated 11th November 1936 on the subject of a flight by a British aeroplane over the Kunsr valley, I have the honour to inform you that investigations by the Government of India show that a violation of this nrture did In fact take place on the date in question. It appears that the pilot who had recently arrived in India lost his way when flying over Bajaur and inrdvertently crossed the border in the direction of Lakra Sar - Shinkora and Asmar. As soon as he discovered his mistake he returned by the sane route. I am desired by the Government of India to convey to the Afghan Government an expression of their great regret for this accidental violation, and to state that every effort is being made to prevent a reoetition of such Incidents.

It is presumed that the note from the linistry of Foreign Affairs, a translation of which was forwarded, refers to the alleged violation which was described in Minister Kabul*s Express letter No.244 dated the 23rd December 1939, although according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs note it occurred somewhere to the east of the Tanni area. If this presumption is correct, material for reply has already been supplied in External Affairs Department Express letter No.F.262(4)-F/59 dated the 29th January 1940. An exhaustive examination which has already been made has revealed that no British aircraft were flying in the vicinity of the Durand Line on the 1st December. 3. Further with reference to paragraph 3 of External Affairs Department letter No.F.262(4)-F/39 dated the 29th January 1940, it is known that at the time of the alleged violation a flight of the Afghan Air Force was wintering at Jalalabad and an Afghan aircraft was reported to be under repair by a German engineer at Matun at tne same time.

A reply regarding the violations alleged under (b) and (c) has already been communicated to His Majesty’s Legation in telegram No. 44 dated the 15th Larch 1939. 3. The violations alleged unaer (a) are too vague to enable enquiries it be made. The allegations are£robably the result of reports of inexperienced observers. 4. //ith regard to tiie allegation under (d), a careful study has been made of all the flying returns for January the 16th, and it has been found that no aircaaft from any frontier station on the Indian side of the border carried out duties in the vicinity of the Madda Khel area at any time on that day. 5. A point worthy of note is that the Afghan; are now equipped with a considerable number of Hinds, which from the ground are imistinguishable from British aircraft employed on the frontier. It is likely that as time goes on, Afghan pilots will fly close to the boraer more and more frequently and allegations will probably be made against us. There is reason to believe that one Afghan pilot may already have violated the^frontier in the ^azixistan area. 6.

The proceedings indicate that in aadition to the normal regulations regarding flying in the vicinity of the liurand Line, special measures were taken to ensure that ail pilots were thoroughly conversant with the topography of the frontier in the neighbourhooa of Lwara before being allowed to fly, other than as passengers, over the Ladda hhel proscribed area* To avoia such errors as the subject of this allegation, pilots took care to keep the Eastern side of the Lwara Plain across which the uurana Line runs Korth arid South* In view of the findings of the Court, Royal Air Force Headquarters are of the opinion that the bomb was not dropped from a British aircraft and are inclined to agree with the original suggestion that if damage of this nature aid in fact occur, it ^as caused by a bomb carried into Afghan territory, &amp; common practice with the tribesmen* 4* The Government of India accept the above opinion, and if you see no objection the Afghan Government may be informed accordingly* 5. The offer to pay compensation to the Afghan Government conveyed in paragraph 5 of the Express letter under reference ana which it is presumed has been communicated /to the Afghan Government still stands, and the Government of India would be glaa to know as soon as possible what the reactions of the Afghan Government are to this offer, and what sum you recommend should be paid on the basis of the Afghan Government’s claim.

With reference to your cypher telegrsun Z. 175 dated 5th April, 1939, ordering investigation of the alleged bombing of LWARA in AFGHANISTAN, the following report* is submitted:- Narrative of Events . 2. (a) On 3rd April, 1939, the followir^ report was received by the Officer Commanding, R.A.F. Miranshah, from Intelli gence Miranshah. 'One bomb is reported to have been thrown into WABZAI ALAM SHAH ? (5054) &gt;n 31st March 1939, and has caused the following losses in the house of one Zarbati of PAIPALI (KABUL KHEL)* ONE KOTALI DAMAGED. 2 cows ) 1 camel ) 6 sheep ) Killed. 2 dogs ) The woman is Madda Khel and her iiusband is Gyan Khel, but permanently living in Madda Khel country. All the animals killed belong to the Madda Khel.' (b) On receipt of the above report the matter was referred to the A.P.A. at Miranshah, who stated that he could not at present confirm it. (c) Later in the day the pinpoints of the reported positions of bombs dropped on 31.3.1939 were communicated to the A.P.A., who said that he was of the opinion that it was probably an unexploded bomb carried into the village. No time for the explosion was given in the message and it was not stated that it was the result of air action. For this reason no report was made to me of the incident by O.C. R.A.F., Miranshah, althou^i I consider that he should have reported the matter. (d)(d) On 5.4.1939 your Z. 175 ms received and on 6.4.1939 I investigated the matter myself at Miranshah report ing on the evening of Satudary (8th) to the A^O.C. at Ri sal pur. Particulars of flights which took place on 31.3.1939, of crews and of the reported pinpoints of the f all of bombs as recorded in the R.A.F. Intelligence Section at Miranshah on 31.3.1939 are attached as Appendix 'A' hereto. From the Appendix it will be seen that no bomb is reported to have been dropped near the DURAND Line. (e) It will also be noted from Appendix that Pilot Officers WILSON and RANGANADAN of No. 39 (B) Squadron and I.A.F. Squadron respectively were up at or about the time of the alleged bomb dropping. (f) I interrogated both these officers who categorica lly stated that they did not drop bombs over the Frontier. (g) I asked the Political Agent on 5.4.1939 to send out agents to obtain a report ir^regard to the incident. In responsen to this request he telegraphed to his Political Naib Tahsildar at DATTA KHSL. His report, at Appendix 'B' ms received on 11th April 1939. As this was not the 'Agent’s 1 IK report which I had asked for, I again asked him on 13.4.1939 for an 'Agent’s' report. In response he sent me the report at Appendix 'G' hereto. Descriution of Frontier in Area concerned . 3. The Frontier dividing AFGHANISTAN from MADBA KBSL tribal area runs entirely along a line of hills except in one fairly small area (LWAKA Plain). It is difficult to determine exact ly how the Frontier runs across this Plain but the mere fact that it is the only plain in the vicinity, and that is well known to all concerned that it is difficult to follow the Frontier across the plain should be sufficient to cause aircraft crews to exercise the utmost caution in taking offensive action in that area. When questioning the pilots who took part in the operations they all informed me that they3 they were aware of the difficulties of determining the Frontier in the LWARA. Plain and for that very reason exercised extreme caution in the LWARA. iurea. iiilsewhere the Frontier is fairly easy to follow, particularly to the North of the MADDA KHSL country where it runs along a knife-edge which is easy to spot from the air. Particulars of the Frontier ags available to personnel at Miranshaht 4# Before the commencement of the operations against the liadda Khel every possible precaution was tai:en to ensure that the Frontier line should be made known to the crews taking part in the operations# Not only were the latest maps made from air survey available at Miransh&amp;h, but I obtained from D.D#I# a vertical photography mosaic of the whole area right up to ani clearly showing the Frontier. In addition especially clear orders were issued regaxding the necessity for carefully avoiding Frontier violation* Experience of Crews* 5, Of the two pilots mentioned above P/0 WILSON had carried out a substantial number of sorties over the MABDA KHEL country previous to 31#3.1939. Pilot olficer RENGtANADaN had carried out one flight over the I/jujDA KxISL ar®. in 1937 and was taken up on the first flight of the day on 31.3,1939 by Pilot Officer MEHR SIIFtH, who also knows the MABDA KHEL country, to learn the area and the Frontier line in particular On being interviewed he told me that Pilot Gfiicer MhHR SINGH had especially pointed out to him the LWARA plain which he had been warned to avoid, CONCLUSIONS. # 6# As will be seen from the above, the reports of the ) pilots and their statements given to me would, if they are true, Jrove that no bombs were dropped across the Frontier on the day in auestion. On^he other hand I have only their words to go by and I have no means of proving the truth of their x statements. The reports of the P.A. North laziristan on the- 4 the other hcmd lead to the inevitable conclusion that ohe alleged incident did take place. It will be observed, however, that the latest report received from P.A. North Yf&amp;ziristan, is a statement made by MADDA KHEL Maliks and not by agents sent out especially to report on the matter# Further it will be noted that the nature of the damage alleged to have been caused by the bomb has not been confirmed in the third report* I have again asked the : *A. whether he has any further information to offer and whether he can obtain unbiased statements of the amount of damage alleged to have been caused* I await your instructions in this matter and in view of the conflict of evidence I do not feel justified in expressing an opinion one way or the other.

(a) On 19th July the Afghan Minister for Foreign Affairs stated (A) to the Military Attache that he had just received reports from the Southern Province to the effect that British aircraft had bombed some Afghan subjects in Tani territory, Afghanistan, and if the report proved to be true he was afraid that the incident would further strain relations between the two Governments. The Minister was informed that in view of the strict instructions issued to all R.A.F. pilots regarding the violation of the Afghan frontier, the incident as reported was unlikely to have occurred, but that it was possible that Afghan subjects who had joined the forces of the Faqir of Ipi had suffered casualties in British Waziristan as a result of recent military operations against the Faqir. (b) At an interview which His Majesty’s Minister had with the Prime Minister, and Minister for Foreign Affairs, on 20th July no mention was made of the incident reported in (a) above. (c) In the course of the conversation on 19 th July the Foreign Minister stated (A) that the Afghan Government had not relaxed in any way the restrictions placed on tribesmen of the Southern Province who wished to proceed to Waziristan to join the Faqir of Ipi.Confidential $&lt;oQ&gt;C.

Detailed information has now been received from the Officer Consmndin^;, No. 1(Indian) Group, regarding the suspected violation of the Afghan Frontier by a Koyal Air Force aircraft on the 10th June 1938. 3. The aircraft was carrying out a flight from Mironshah to Arawali in the Kurram Valley in connection with operations, Visibility on this day was extremely poor, owing to a thick dust haze hanging over Vaziriatan. A strong easterly wind appears to have blown the aircraft to the west of its track, and it is possible that the border may have been violated for a short period at about noon to a depth of not more tn^i three miles between squares 2720 and 5604 (Map dheet ^Q/K). Ab soon as the pilot was able to locate his position, he turned due east. He reported the occurrence immediately after landing. 4. It is by no means certain that violation of the frontier did in fact occur, and it is suggested that it should not be mentioned to the Afghan Government unless they complain. If they do complain, it is requested that, if in the internal Affairs Department To - His Majesty's jnvoy ^xtraoroinfury and Minister Plenipotentiary at the Court of j fghanista#, Kabul. duapected violation of fghan Frontier. you /- 2 you see no objection, they may be informed as in paragraph 3 above and an expression of the Government of India*s regret conveyed to them.

After a thorough investigation of the case, it appears that no violation of the ifghan frontier took place on the 21st Jaxiuaiy 1938. Tiie facts are as follows;- On the morning of the 21st January 1938, two aircraft were engaged on close support of the 3rd Brigade operating in tiie vicinity of Both pilots who are well acquainted with this area are certain that they did not cross the border, especially as their duties were taken up wiun co-operation with the Brigade.

These complaints concern allegations of violations of Afghan territory by aircraft of the Royal Air Force (RAF) based along the North West Frontier. These complaints are then either upheld or rejected by the Government of India – as a result of internal investigation – and a response issued via the British Legation. In some cases copies of the reports compiled at Peshawar, Headquarters of No 1 RAF (Indian) Group, can be found alongside the correspondence. In addition, the file also contains a relatively small number of counter complaints made by the Government of India, concerning violations of British Indian territory by Afghan aircraft, which are mainly found towards the front of the file.It also contains material related to an allegation that an RAF aircraft dropped a bomb on the Afghan village of Lwarah (also spelt Lawarah) on 31 March 1939; see folios 68-94. A detailed breakdown of the compensation claim made by the Government of Afghanistan can be found on folios 68-69.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year.
