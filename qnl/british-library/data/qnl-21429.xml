The following brief sketch of the more salient features of the political history of Persia during the past few years will help to explain the present situ ation in that country. By the beginning of the present century, the condition of Persia, which for some years had been giving cause for grave anxiety, had grown quite intolerable. The Shah, Muzaffar- ud-Din, was entirely in the hands of a corrupt ring of courtiers, who were living on the spoils of the Gov ernment and country. He had parted with the treasures inherited from his father and with most of the imperial and national domains. He had thus been obliged to have recourse to foreign loans, the proceeds of which he had spent in foreign travel or had lavished on his favourites. There was a yearly deficit and the debt of the country was growing daily. Disturbances broke out everywhere and the popular discontent was not appeased until the Shah, in August 1906, had signed a decree granting constitutional Government to the people. A Majlis, or National Assembly, of 162 representatives of all classes, elected by their peers, met in October of that year. A few days later Muzaffar-ud-Din died. The new Shah, Muhammad Ali, adopted a reactionary policy and made every endeavour to crush the constitutional movement, even in 1908 bombarding the Majlis while sitting, with his Russian-officered Cossack division, and abolishing the Constitution. A 22 The country had been further confused by the attempt on the part of the liussians to extend their influence over the whole country, and the attempt on the part of the British to combat this move. With a view to putting an end to this mutual rivalry, the Anglo-Russian Convention with regard to Persia was concluded in the year 1907 without any reference to the.Persian Government. By the terms of this agree ment the country was divided into three zones j the Russian, neutral and British spheres, and each country agreed not to interfere in the other’s sphere. The Russian zone included all country north of a line drawn east and west through Kermanshah, Isfahan and Yezd, these three towns being in the Russian sphere of influencethe northern boundary of the British sphere being a line through Bandar Abbas, -Kerman and Birj and. The Russian zone thus includ- ed all the richest parts of the country, whereas the British zone was principally desert, although includ ing the important oil bearing area of Arabistan. , '^: s a ^. esu lt of the Shah’s policy of oppression consti tutionalist committees were formed and insurrections OU t a11 over th e country; Tehran was captured in 1909 by the constitutionalists composed of forces from Resht, and of Bakhtiaris moving from Isfahan. Muhammed Ah abdicated in favour of his son, Ahmad Mirza, a boy of 12 years of age, and, after various abortive attempts to recover his throne, retired to Russia where he was allowed a pension by the Persian Government. At this period Persian opinion regard ed Great Britain as a benevolent well-wisher to the schemes of reform. There was, however, no improvement in the state of Persia and fresh disturbances broke out everywhere, notably in Pars. ’ m n B rR h In 1911 a ^ d , 1913 i several further attempts were made by the ex-Shah and his brother, Salar-ud-Douleh, to overthrow the existing Government. These all ended T J es ® dls turbances, however, coupled with the attitude adopted by Russia, who by the end of 1913, ad on one pretext and another sent some 14,000 troopsinto Northern Persia, had brought Persia to the verge of ruin. Her treasury was empty, she had no military forces available to suppress disorders or to collect revenue, and there was no strong public man to be found to direct efforts at reform. Most of her troubles were ascribed to Russia, which had consistent ly thwarted every effort at reform; but Great Britain also incurred much odium for her supposed conni vance. During the Great War, Turkish troops and German agents entered Persia in order to cause further diffi culties for the British. Their efforts were unsuccess ful, but they had the effect of increasing still further the difficulties of the Persian Government, As a result of the collapse of the Russian forces resultant on the revolution in 1918, British forces were sent through Persia in 1918 to occupy Baku and por tions of the Caucasus in order to close the road to India for enemy agents, and for the same purpose military missions were sent to Meshed and inta Turkistan to link up with the East Persian Cordon. The British troops were eventually forced to retire from Baku owing to the lack of support given by the local authorities, and established themselves in North Persia. An additional danger arose early in 1920 from the advance of the Bolsheviks to the borders of the old Tsarist Empire in Trans-Caucasia and Turkistan. Their arrival there was the signal for an attempt on their part to get their agents into Persia, and also for a violent anti-Persian campaign in the Bolshevik press. The general tenor of this campaign was that the Persians must organise a revolution and get rid of the Shah, and that, if they could not start a revo lution for themselves, then the Bolsheviks would in vade their country and do it for them. On the excuse of capturing the Volunteer Caspian Fleet which was interned at Enzeli, the Bolsheviks, in May 1920, landed troops at that port, got into touch with Kuchik Khan, the leader of the local Persian revolutionaries, and commenced an advance on Tehran. The Persian4 forces, backed as they were at that time by British troops, checked this advance, but were unable to drive out the Russians. Under the Anglo-Persian Agreement concluded in 1919, the British Government had offered to advance to Persia two million pounds sterling, and to reorga nise her army and finances. A military commission and also a financial mission were sent to Tehran to make the preliminary recommendations for this re organisation. The Persian Government, however, were from the start only half-hearted about the Agreement, and put obstacle after obstacle in the way of its rati fication. Furthermore keen propaganda against the agreement was carried on by the American and French Legations at Tehran. On the Mejlis re-assembling they failed to ratify the agreement, which lapsed into oblivion. Early in 1920 the Persian Government commenced to negotiate with the Bolsheviks primarily for the with drawal of Russian troops from Persian soil, and ulti- mately in February 1921 concluded a treaty with them by which the Bolsheviks agreed to recall their troops and to hand back to Persia all concessions held by the late Tsarist Government in return for permission to have a Russian Legation at Tehran and Russian consuiates in all the thief Persian towns. Shortly after the signature of this treaty Saiyid Zia-ud-Din, with the help of the Persian Cossack Division, over threw the Government, and set to work to institute reforms of a sweeping nature, which included the re organisation of the Persian army and finances under British advisers. While accepting as part of his pohcy the mam principles of the Anglo-Persian Agree ment^ he denounced the Agreement itself, and ratified the Russian treaty. In May, his honest attempt to set his countiy s house in order was upset by jealousy and ntngue, and Saiyid Zia was forced to resign. His tei^rT a t0 the newl y- arri ved Russian Minis- in thp d ® ^ him to start an anti-British campaign n ft Pltal T&gt; and to advance the Bolshevik cause orthern Persia to the detriment of British prestige. As a result of the failure on the part ofX &amp; .tisi rive in fflce 'ga- iioii to re- _ ere at, iti- int ms to to h- i- i, s y a .n ly n, el ite re- der his ■ee- ied set ind His iis- ign ,use tish of the Persian Government to ratify the Anglo-Persian agreement, British troops were withdrawn from NortH Persia in April 1921. The Cabinet which came into power after Saiyid Zia’s fall, came more and “ lo ’- e under Russian influence, and Persia was exploited by Russia owing to the inability of her weak and corrup leaders to break the spell the Russian Minister had cast over them. The national finances were chaotic, and it appeared as if the future contained little hope of any improvement, unless Persia could cut adrift from her present position, and obtain assistance both in money and expert advice from some country other than Russia, to enable her to set about her own recons truction. A complete change, however, was brought about by Reza Khan and Dr. Millspaugh. The former, who came into prominence in February, 1921, as the leader of the force which carried out the coup d etat of Saiyid Zia-ud-Din, has been virtual military dictator and has set himself the task of: — (1) Creating an efficient Persian Army. (2) Eliminating foreign influence from the country. (3) Strengthening the Central Government over the whole country. At this time (April 1921) there were four distinct armed bodies in Persia— (a) the “ Persian Cossack Division ” the Russian officers of which had been evacuated from Persia by the British forces during 1919 and 1920. (&amp;) the “ Gendarmerie,” a Swedish trained and officered military police force, which during the war had given much trouble to the British authorities owing to the pro-German leanings of the majority of its Swedish officers. t6 (c) the “ South Persia Kifles,” a force located in the provinces of Pars and Kerman raised and officered by British officers. This force had been raised to take the place of the pro- German Pars Gendarmerie, which had been disbanded during 1917. (d) the “ Nizam ” or Persian regular army, an ill-trained, ill-equipped and useless force. Of these four bodies by far the most efficient was the South Persia Rifles, which was equipped, paid for, and officered by the British Government. This force, however, had not been recognised officially by any Persian cabinet, and had even been denounced as “ a force designed to further British Imperialistic designs upon Persia.” On the failure of the Anglo- Persian agreement, demands were made by the Persian Government for the withdrawal of the British officers; the force was offered to the Persian Government to be taken over as a going concern, but the offer was re fused, and it was decided to disband the force. The disbandment was completed by the end of 1921. With a view to attaining the first and second of his objects, in January 1922 the terms “Persian Cossack Division and “ Nizam ” were abolished by order of Reza Khan, and the term “ Qushun ” (army) substi tuted. At the same time the Gendarmerie was dis banded, the Swedish officers dismissed from Persian service, and a portion of the personnel transferred to the Lushun A small proportion of Swedish officers however, still remained m the police, the last of these not being dismissed until March 1924. Reza Khan has already (1924) to a great extent 45 C 0 C 00 ed men m - hlS ^ Persian Arni y totals some 5,000 men, is gradually being equipped with modern ^ haS P r i° Ved ^ htin S value in operations of Per Jl 16 £ ar '- llke ^ lbes llvin g within the borders ot Persia. During the period 1922-23, the rebel- Kuchlk , f ban in Grilan, Mohamed Taqi' m Khorasan, and Lahouti Khan in Azarbaiian were e^fn 6 battlT'!, ^ of , the „ north have been defeat ed in battle and disarmed. Operations against theL. Lurs have, however, not been entirely snecessful, British troops have been withdrawn from the barhad and Persian troops have taken over the Sarhad and Persian Baluchistan; British troops in Persia have been reduced to 2 Companies for the garrisoning ot the Persian Gulf. The only foreigners at present (November 1924) employed in the Persian army are the aviators (French, German and Russian), some German mecha nics and technical advisers in the arsenal, and a tew Russian ex-officers of the Tsarist army employed as instructors in the military school. Dr. Millspaugh, with a mission of other Americans arrived in Tehran in November 1922, to assume the position of Financial Adviser to the Persian Govern ment. He has instituted financial reforms and en forced payment of revenue by means of the help given him by the reorganised army, although he has found it increasingly difficult to balance his budget owing to growing expenditure by the War Ministry. As a means of raising money, the Persian Govern ment has been attempting to dispose of the oil con cession for the five provinces of North Persia in ex change for a loan. This concession had been pur chased from Khoshtaria, a Russian concessionaire, by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, but, owing to its not having been ratified by the Meilis, the Persian Gov ernment refused to recognise the sale. The strong anti-British feeling caused by the abortive Anglo- Persian agreement and Russian propaganda deterred the Persian Government from admitting to it any company which had British capital, and they there fore tried to interest American capital in the venture. The company most favoured by the Persian Govern ment was the Sinclair company, as it was suspected that their rivals, the Standard Oil Company, had a private agreement with the A. P. O. C. After^ consi dering the question the Sinclair company in the summer of 1924 announced that they were willing to take up the concession, but not to give a loan, thus failing to meet the chief requirement of the Persian Government, which is still in urgent need of money.I Meanwhile feeling in the country towards the Crown had undergone a change, the Shah’s continued resi dence abroad, and propaganda carried on with the connivance of Reza Khan having led to the growth of a republican party. This republican movement, although artificial, appeared likely to meet with suc cess owing to the general apathy of the country. It was intended to proclaim a republic on the Persian New Year (March 22nd 1924), but a few days before this date the mullahs, having as an example the recent incidents in Turkey, and fearing a similar diminution of their power should a Persian republic be pro claimed, started energetic propaganda against the proposed change. As a result, public opinion in Persia, which is always most swayed by the cry of “ religion,” began to veer round. Minor disturbances occurred,. and Reza Khan realising the true power of the mullahs published an order forbidding all further consideration of a change. The Russian attitude with regard to this movement was curious. It met with their support until a few days before the destined proclamation of a republic, when the Russians imagining that the British were in favour of the change, and not wishing a republic headed by Reza Khan, changed their policy and supported the mullahs in their resistance. The position of the American advisers had become increasingly difficult. Discontent caused by their financial reforms, their dismissal of inefficient em ployees, and the little actual concrete evidence of their work gave rise to strong feelings against them which were sedulously fanned by the Russian Lega tion. Virulent anti-Millspaugh articles were written in the press, and it appeared probable that their dis missal would ensue. At this juncture (July 1924) the American Vice-consul in Tehran, Mr. Imbrie, was murdered by a fanatical mob while attempting to photograph a shrine. The Cabinet, realising how detrimental it would be to the Persian hopes of rais ing a foreign loan if the financial advisers were dis missed so soon after this unfortunate incident, made haste to improve their relations with Dr. Millspaugh.During 1924 Reza Khan fell somewhat from his position as a national hero, to which he had risen in Persian eyes. The republican fiasco alluded to above was the chief cause of this. Still he has persevered with his reforms, has partially succeeded in disarming the tribes, has practically quelled the Turkoman rebellion, and by the autumn of 1925 has recovered to a great extent the ground he lost in 1924. The military regime, however, is becoming un popular and the conservative party, headed by the mullahs, are as hostile to progress as ever. Now (October 1925) Reza Khan has welcomed the avowed intention of the Shah to return to Persia. We shall shortly see whether His Majesty will do so, will prolong his sojourn in Europe, or abdicate in favour ■of a relation, or whether the majority of the Persian people will demand to be ruled by the latest saviour of their country—Reza Khan.Altitude and Passage.—South-east of the Safid Rud the continuous ridge of the Elburz runs without a break to the Firuzkuh Pass, north-east of Tehran; thence it continues East to the province of Astarabad. North-west of the Safid Rud the Masuleh and Talish hills form a single unbroken range and afford no open line of approach. The main ridge is terminated south-east of the Safid Rud by the peak of Darfak (8,500') which rises precipi tously above the valley. East of this peak, through Dailiman, it is wide and undulating, TjOOO' to 8,000' in height. It narrows and increases to an elevation of 10,000 / to 12,000' rising to Damavand (18,600'). It decreases to 7,000' at Firuzkuh Pass and averages 9,000' to 10,000' further east, until it merges into the South-East extremity of the Kupeh Dagh range east of Bujnurd. The main passes are the Kuen and Firuzkuh, the former of which leads into the valley of the Safid Rud at Manjil. The winter cold on all the ridges is intense, and sudden terrific storms of wind and snow render the crossing of them dangerous and often fatal. Local 'village to village tracks over them are almost all blocked by snow from November or December up to March or April. Of the eight routes across the highest section of the Elburz, five are closed every winter for periods varying from 3 to 6 months, while three normally remain open except for 10 to 20 days. Width of the range. —South-east of the Safid Rud the width of the Elburz shows little variation and the distance along most routes from the point where they first enter the mountains from the plateau to the point where they finally emerge through the foothills on the Caspian lowlands is approximately 60 miles. North-west of the Safid Rud the width of the Masuleh and Talish hills is less and continues to decrease further north.12 Lateral Valleys.—T\iQ chief of these are:— Nur, which runs for some 60 miles from west to east to its junction with the Ha,raz. ihe Nur valley is from 100 yards to £ mile m width with strips of cultivation along tne river and forms a fairly easy line of com munication for pack mules. The mountains on both sides are precipitous, rocky, ana bare. (2) Shahrud, which runs for some 100 miles from east to west to its junction with the band Rud at Manjil. The Shahrud valley is for the most part a wide sloping basm through the bottom of which the river has cut a broad stony watercourse, but from below Anbuh bridge to within a few miles of Loshan it contracts into a gorge. It is con sequently an indifferent line of communi cation. (3) Kizil Uzun, which runs from north-west to- south-east to Manjil. (4) Lar valley, which runs from west to east for about 60 miles, curves round the foot of Mount Damavand, and joins the Nur Valley north-east of the mountain. The river Lar, where it flows into the Caspian, is known as the Haraz. Vegetation—Yrom. East to West luxuriant vegeta tion extends throughout the Caspian provinces, the only variation being that the forest trees of Mazanderan and Tunakhabun are bigger than those in Gilan. On the Elburz range vegetation is limited to the slopes nearest the sea which catch and intercept the fertilising moisture from the Caspian. The valleys of the Nur, Lar and Kizil Uzun are utterly bare. (&amp;) North-West System. —Azarbaijan is a mass of mountains. Of these, Mount Savalan, west ofArdabil (15,792 feet), is the eastern termination of the Qusheh Dagh range and to the north-west of it the Kara Dagh runs up to near Julfa. These mountains contain coal deposits and other minerals. The Sahand mountains, south of Tabriz, rise to a. height of 11,600 feet. (c) The North-West to South-East System.—Whiz system occupies the western, south-western and south eastern portions of the country. It consists of a series of mountain chains which, extending from the Armenian and Kurdish highlands, run parallel to' one another, with extraordinary regularity in a south easterly direction through Luristan, the Bakhtiari country and Fars and thence follow a more easterly direction through Baluchistan, roughly parallel to the coast. The following description of the Pusht-i-Kuh is typical of this area :— “ The steep slopes of the lofty ridges are covered with thin oak forest. In the valleys there is no vegetation. The rivers are all fordable with stony beds. The roads are awful, in fact they are not roads but paths, difficult both for pack animals and pedestrians. The high est peak here is Manisht Kuh (QjSOO^ which has a flat summit.” South-west of Hamadan are the Alvand Mountains, the highest point of which is 12,290 feet. These are noteworthy, as the main road from Kermanshah to Hamadan passes over them. The Bakhtiari country is a complete section of the Zagros Mountains. The highest peaks run up to 12,000—13,000 feet. To the south-west tiers of hills succeed one another retaining, however, their north-west to south-east trend, and gradually decreasing in height as the Arabistan hills are approached. This mass of moun tains has precipitous gorges through which the Karun and Diz rivers force tortuous courses. Valleys usuallyrun parallel to the ranges, their bottom remaining at fairly constant elevations, giving easy gradients tor Se main tracks which generally follow the banks of the rivers. The northern slopes have the ordinary treeless, grassless, waterless, soft moulded but corrugated characteristics so common in Persia. The southern slopes usually have water and pasture in abundance and often stunted forest growth, chiefly of dwart oak. The mountains of Pars are a prolongation of the Zagros range. The further from the Persian bull, the higher rise the parallel ridges of mountains, and their peaks have the appearance of being placed one on the top of the other : they are bare and rocky with little vegetation. Mountains near Shiraz reach a height of 14,000 feet, while Khurmuj, S. E. by E. of Bushire, although only 6,430 feet, is a good landmark from the Gulf and surrounding country. The same mountain system passes through the pro vince of Kerman which to the south is very mountain ous. Some of the ranges—for instance, the Jabal Bariz—reach an altitude of almost 15,000 feet. They are covered in places with oak scrub. Many of the valleys are well cultivated and have good orchards. In winter, snow sometimes blocks the higher passes. a The Chhil Tan Range situated about the centre of the Sarhad plateau (elevation 12,500 feet) is volcanic. The same applies to the Kuh-i-Bazman, north of Bampur, which is 11,217 feet. The Kuh-i-Ginau, 18 miles from Bandar Abbas, is 7,783 feet. This mountain range finally ends in Baluchistan, rising to nearly 13,000 feet. (d) Eastern System .—The mountains in the eastern •districts of Persia are on a less strongly defined system than in the north, west and south. There are, how ever, a few well marked ridges, the general trend of'which is more or less from north to south. Of these the most noteworthy are: — (i) Mirjawa Range —extends in a S. E. direction past Kuh-i-Malik Siah, a low black hill S.bGS' to Mirjawa. Of this system, the Kacha Kuh range rises to 7,763' and a peak just south of Robat to 7,772'. (ii) Kuh-i-Baqaran —runs east and west just south of Birjand. These hills are bare and slatey, of various colours and covered with snow in winter. Around the bases the ground is very fertile. Highest point 8,358 feet. &lt;iii) Knh-i-Bakharz —a snowy range which is a continuation towards the Afghan frontier of the mountain N.-W. of Turbat-i-Haidari. Average height 7,000 feet. (iv) Kuh-i-Faghan in the Turbat-i-Haidari Dis trict, the culminating point of a range which extends S.-W. through Tabas District. (v) The Kara J)agh east of Meshed extends in a northwesterly direction along the Perso- Russian frontier until it disappears in the Kupeh Dagh near Kizil Arvat. 3. River and Canal system.—The, rivers may be classified under five heads according to the direction in which they drain: — (i) into the deserts of Turkistan and into the Caspian, (ii) into Lake Urumieh, (iii) into the Persian Gulf, (iv) into the Hamun of Sistan. (i) Rivers draining into deserts of Turkistan and into the Caspian. ITari Rud, (or Ab-i-Herat) forms the eastern boundary between Persia and Afghanistan. It rises m Afghanistan and first touches the Perso-Afghan16 frontier near Kafir Kaleh. It is fordable in most places. The Kashaf Rud (Ab-i-Meshed) joins it at Pul-i-Khatun. There is a stone bridge over the Han Rud at Pul-i-Khatun. Tejen is a continuation of the Hari Rud below Sarakhs. It has a very diminished stream, and in the dry season there is sometimes no water in it at Sarakhs. It gradually loses itself in the sands of the Kara Kum Desert. Kashaf Rud (Ab-i-Meshed) rises in the Chinaran sub-district of Meshed close to the Chashmeh-i-Gilas. It flows first N.-E. and after crossing the Kuchan- Meshed road, turns S.-E. and then east to Pul-i- Khatun where it joins the Hari Rud after a course of 130 miles. Its volume and quality vary to an ex traordinary degree during summer and autumn. This is due to the drawing off of water for cultiva tion, and to the accession of sometimes fresh and some times brackish tributaries. Between Baghbaghu and Ak Darband it is undrinkable. Between Pul-i- Khatun and Kuzgan it is difficult to cross except at recognised places owing to the steepness of its banks and the treacherous nature of its bottom, which is mud of a quicksand type. It is particularly danger ous between Langarak and Ak Darband. Numerous fords exist above Meshed, but few below that place. The best and easiest is at Baghbaghu. There are three bridges to the north of Meshed, two on the road to Chehchah and Dushakh, and one south of Meshed near Kuzgan on the road to Pul-i-Khatun. Atral rises about 17 miles north-east of Kuchan and pursues a westerly course to the Caspian into which it falls at Hasan Quli Bay after a course of 300 miles. Fordable points are at long intervals apart and exist only from the end of August to the end of January. About a quarter of a mile below Chat, however, there is a ford which is nearly always passable. Gnrgan rises on the plateau of Armutli and,_ after flowing west for 200 miles, falls into the Caspian tothe north of Astarabad Bay. Near its mouth it fre quently overflows its banks, when the country becomes, a morass. Although its waters are deep, boats of the lightest draught cannot ascend owing to the extreme shallowness of the Caspian Sea at its mouth. It becomes very swollen after the melting of snow and occasionally after summer rain. At other times it is shallow, but even then fordable at only a few points below Ak Kaleh; here there are bands and a fordable line runs obliquely across the stream. The river bank is almost invariably a vertical earth clift. Access to the fords is either by a roughly worn ram gully, or by a steep ramp worn parallel to the river by the descent of animals. The stream contains good drinking water and the ground on both banks is very rich. |n the upper reaches it runs in a wide deep valley, but at Gumbad-i-Kabus has a narrow bed, 30 feet do e P, which is quite invisible at a short distance. Both, banks here are steep and bare. There are three small wooden bridges; one at Ak Kaleh; one^at Uba-i- Areh Khan J’afarbai and one at Oba-i-Nap Muham mad Khan. Haraz rises 25 miles north of Tehran and flows east through the Bar valley where it is known as the Bar river. From the foot of the Damavand mountain it bends north and enters the Caspian Sea near Amul after a course of about 100 miles. In its upper reaches it is a mountain torrent: further along its course it runs in deep, narrow channels crossed by a number of wooden bridges, and finally enteis^ the plains for the last part of its course. At Amul it is very broad, but not more than 2 feet deep, unless swollen by melting snow which in spring makes it very full and rapid. At Amul it is crossed by a masonry bridge of 12 arches. Kizil Uzun rises in Ardalan about 20 miles north west of Senneh. Near Karagul it is fordable at times, but difficult and dangerous owing to the rapidity of the current and the masses of rock which are brought down the stream and which constantly change the fords. The water is at its lowest in Nov ember. b 218 I In spring, the only possible crossing is by rafts. Lower down there is an easy ford 3 miles from Marran : the river is here shallow and narrow except when the snows melt. At Mianeh there is a stone bridge of 12 arches. The river is wide and fordable except in spring. At 8 miles above Alvar it is crossed by a bridge of six arches. Safid Rud is the name given to the Kizil Uzun fi'om Manjil to the Caspian Sea which it enters about 40 miles east of Enzeli. At Manjil there is a suspen sion bridge passable for all traffic. In spring, the river is an impassable torrent. There is a ferry a little west of the village of Reshtabad on the road from Resht to Lahijan, where the river is about 100 yards wide. It is only navigable for small boats near its mouth, where the depth varies from 3 to 7 feet. Aras forms the northern frontier of N.-W. Persia. It rises in the Bindagh mountains, takes generally easterly direction and after a course of 510 miles joins the Kur river about 10 miles from the Caspian Sea, into which it falls above the Bay of Kizil Agach. There are numerous fords on the upper Aras some of which are open only in the summer and early autumn. Elsewhere the river is rapid and unfordable. The most important crossing is at Julfa, where there is a Russian built bridge carrying the railway and a ferry worked by wire hawsers from both banks. (ii) Rivers draining into Lake Urumieh. Ajichai rises near Ardabil, passes within 3 miles of Tabriz and, winding over a bed of sand and gravel, enters Lake Urumieh west of Gurgan. In spring it is large and rapid owing to melting snows. &amp; In summer, its bed near the lake is frequently dry. The water becomes brackish in passing through the salt plain 20 miles N.-W. of Tabriz, and this brackishness increases m intensity on its approach to the lake owing to the extensive saline marshes through which it flows. Close to the northern gate of Tabriz, a brick bridge of 12 arches and 230 paces in length, crosses oneof its tributaries. The river is sometimes frozen so hard and covered with snow in winter as to be indistin guishable from the surrounding country. In August it is usually dry. Jaghatu (Chaghatu) rises about 30 miles north of Senneh and falls into Lake Urumieh below Mianduab. At the last named place and its neigh bouring villages boats are kept for use as ferries when the river is in flood. In summer it is easily fordable throughout its course, but in winter it is difficulty though not quite impassable. (iii) Rivers draining into the Persian Gulf. Karun is the largest and only navigable river in Persia. Its main source is in the western spurs of the Kuh-i-Rang (Jaihun) in the heart of the Bakhtiari country, about 100 miles due west of Isfahan. Owing to numbers of large springs it be comes almost at once a formidable river fordable only from June to December and then only in its upper reaches. Its banks are deep and steep, being in places 1,000 to 3,000 feet high for long stretches. Many tributaries join it; the most noteworthy of these is the Ab-i-Diz, which represents the drainage of the Chahar Mahal plateau, and enters it at about the 75th mile. Up to its junction with Ab-i-Diz the Karun is bridged in places by stone and wooden structures. At this point the united waters turn south and become quite unfordable, though occasionally bridges are met with. The Karun, after winding through the hills, finally emerges through the Tang-i- Kaleh-Dukhteran, east of the plain of Ab-i-Bid. About 600 yards before reaching Shushtar, it divides into two branches, which re-unite at a point 30 miles due south of Shushtar. At the confluence is Band-i- Qir where the Ab-i-Diz joins the Karun. At this point there is a ferry. Immediately above Ahwaz the river divides again for a while into two streams. After re-uniting their waters, it breaks through a ridge of sandstone hills and forms a series of rapids which obstruct the navigation for 1^ miles. From20 Band-i-Qir to Ahwaz the normal width of the Karun is 300 yards, and, except for sand banks and heaps of stones, navigation is easy. The banks vary in height from 10 to 30 feet, the land beyond being gravelly plains. The rapids at Ahwaz, though passable by towing, are a serious obstacle, even to native boats, especially with a very high or very low river. They are about 2,000 yards in length and 5 in number, the real obstacle to navigation being the second from the top, where a reef runs out from the left bank, leaving a channel only 100 yards broad, which is broken by islets into two or three passages of which that adjoin ing the right bank is the easiest. From Nasiri to Muhammerah, the river has a normal width of J mile and low banks. The difference in height between high and low river is usually only 12 to 14 feet. It is usually at its lowest from the middle of October to the end of November, whilst the highest floods occur in March and April. In most parts at ordinary seasons there is little to impede navigation by vessels of 5 or even 6 feet draught, but in the 20 miles below Ahwaz vessels of 3j feet draught sometimes have difficulty when the water is low. From Ahwaz to within V miles of Shushtar the Karun is navigable for light draught steamers which can also ascend its tributary, the Ab-i-Diz, to within 14 miles in a direct line from Dizful. There are ferries at Wais, Kut Abdullah and Ghazzariah, but no bridges below those at Shushtar. Ab-i-Diz is formed by the junction of two consider able streams, one flowing from near Burujird and draining Silakhur, the other draining upper Faridan and passing Baznui. The united streams enter Arabistan and pass Dizful on the left bank. Here a fine bridge, dilapidated but still passable, spans the river. Below Dizful the bed of the stream is broad and shingly. It becomes excessively tortuous ‘before joining the Karun at Band-i-Qir.From Kut Bandar to Band-i-Qir, about 85 miles by water, there is no obstacle to navigation except the strong current. At Kut Bandar there is a reef. Karkheh, formed by three streams which unite some 30 miles N.-N.-W. of Dizful. It enters the plains of Arabistan 15 miles west of Ab-i-Diz. It is largely used for irrigation. The river finally enters the Shatt-al-Arab below Qurneh under the name of the Shwaib. Jarrahi, formed by the junction of the Bamuz river and the Marun. Largely used for irrigation. There are numerous fords, but these are difficult in winter and after rain. HIndian, formed by the junction of two streams, one sweet and one bitter, at a point mid-way between Behbehan and Bandar Dilam. At first it has a breadth of 70 yards and a strong current of 3^ miles. There are fords with firm shingly bottoms but the strength of the stream necessitates care in crossing them. In spring the stream is especially deep and strong, and many of the fords are impassable. The lower Hindian is navigable for native sea-going craft as far as the town of that name and sometimes as far as Kut. At Kut it is 8 yards wide, but unfordable. At Deh Mulla, some distance up stream, there is a ferry. The river reaches the Gulf through mud fiats where there is a bar of soft clay, and its mouth is difficult to discover. It is therefore marked by poles. Its waters are drink able, though not palatable. Mand enters the Persian Gulf some 65 miles S.-E. of Bushire; drains an immense area of country. Its tributaries, which are very numerous, flow past Firuzabad, Jahrum, and Lar. (iv) Fivers entering the central deserts. Ab-i-Qum originates in the BakhtiaVi Mountains and flows N.-E. past Qum into the Daria-i-Namak. Kara Chai joins the Ab-i-Gum near its mouth and flows west to east from near Hamadan. It is fordable in summer, but not in spring when it is swollen by22 rain and melting snow. It is generally 25—30 yards wide and 4—5 feet deep with a muddy bottom. There is a stone bridge on the Hamadan road about 3 miles from the town and a rickety wire suspension bridge for foot passengers on the road from the town of Taq-i-Bostan. It is also bridged where the old and new Tehran-Qum roads cross it. Zindeh Rud rises in the Bakhtiari mountains on the opposite side of the watershed to the Karun river,, flows past Isfahan, and then loses itself in the marsh of Gav Khaneh about 80 miles eastwards. It is crossed by 13 bridges, of which 5 are at Isfahan. Numbers of irrigation channels draw off its water. Kur (Band Amir) rises in the Dina Mountains and flows S.-E. to Lake Niriz. At about 30 miles north of Shiraz, the road thence to Isfahan crosses this river by the Pul-i-Khan, a bridge with two main arches of irregular size and shape. Here the river runs swiftly, though elsewhere it is slow and deep. It is- generally unfordable. The water is fairly good. Eight miles below Pul-i-Khan is the dam of Asad-ud- Douleh upon wdiich stands a bridge of 13 arches, 120' yards in length. Five more dams divert the water lower down, but the residue reaches Lake Niriz. (e) Rivers draining into the Sistan Hamuns. The Helmand, Farah Rud, Harut Rud and Xhash, Rud converge and discharge their waters into the Hamuns of Sistan. They are all Afghan rivers, but the Helmand forms part of the Perso-Afghan frontier and irrigates Sistan. The best fords over the Helmand are always at the bars or shallows of the river. Heavy floods, by moving the gravel and boulders in the river bed, completely alter the posi tion of the less important fords, but do not affect the important ones. The Helmand becomes unfordable- for loaded camels, owing to rains, nearly a month before the end of the winter. Towards the end of March it is usually well in flood and impassable to equestrians owing to rainfall and melting snow. The river rises to its maximum flood level towards the middle or end of April, or at latest early in May,.nnrl then slowly but steadily subsides. Approaches- to foSs have to be ramped in order to save camels from falls. n v n 4. Lakes and Hamuns (i.e., low lying ground liable to become a lake). Urumieh (Daria-i-ShaU).-The dimensions of the lake vary according to the season of the year, but toe mean measurements are84 miles long a miles wide. At high water the lake covers 2,300 square miles; at low water, 1,550 square miles It is 4 230 feet above the sea and, although salt, its salinity is less than that of the Dead Sea. It m very shallow and the bed is a series of terraces, so that each change of depth takes place abruptly, not gradually, ihe maximum known depth is 45 feet, but the a ^® rage ^ t not more than 15-16; a man can walk 2 miles out from the shore without getting out of his depth. Mo fish can live in its waters. The banks are covered with a thick, treacherous slime composed partly ot salt partly of decomposed vegetable matter emitting a horrible effluvium. The lake is little used for navi gation, though it, and its tributary streams, are suit able. Fourteen rivers of various sizes discharges into the lake which has no outlet. Daria-i-Namak (Masilah), east of Qum—a lai F' e e F pause of salt water, the eastern boundary of which is formed by a continuous sheet of hard salt rock [ ese “V' bling ice. This, in winter, is said to be covered with 2 or 3' feet of salt water, but does not dissolve, aftord- ing a firm passage and good foothold. The groun adioining is kavir or swampy soil with a salty efflo rescence where the roads are not easily distinguish able. This lake is fed by the Ab-i-Qum and by a num ber of small streams rising in the southern slopes ot the Elburz Range. The chief of these is the bhur. Daria-i-Niriz (Nairiz Bakhtigan), east of Shiraz— length about 60 miles, breadth 3 to 5 miles. Its waters are derived almost entirely from the river n dry summers the water evaporates entirely and the inhabitants collect salt from the bed. The shores ar,e soft, fine mud and the water is extremely salty.24 Jaz Murian .—As shown on the map, the size of the hamun is misleading. The entire ground between halanzan on the east and Zah Kalat on the west is liable to inundation during the rains. Between these two spots is the actual limit of the swamps, i.e., some 50 miles by 20. Jaz Murian is a sweet water lake. Water remains permanently only between Kalanzan and Gumbaz.' In the hot weather the swamp is mostly dried up. Hamun-i-Helmand .—The area liable to inundation at high flood is 2,742 square miles, the actual hamun being 1,4/4 square miles. The area liable to inunda tion divides itself naturally into four main basins: — (а) The eastern basin, or Hamun-i-Puzak. (б) The northern basin, or Hamun-i-Sabari. (c) The southern basin, or Hamun-i-Kuh-i- Khwaj a. {d) The south-eastern basin, or Gaud-i-Zireh * which includes the Sar-i-Shila. The area liable to inundation consists of two characteristic classes—the naizar, or reed marsh, and the hamun. The former is low lying ground ’ over which the waters spread themselves on their way to the hamun to a depth of several feet. These reed beds connect the various hamuns and in flood time iorm one large sheet of water for miles round. There are well known paths across the naizar. The rise of water each year commences in the amun-i-Puzak about April: thence the overflow enters the northern and southern basins in succession, the water begins to fall about July, and in September t ne low level is again reached. 5. Desert. Dasht-i-Kamr occupies the centre of Khorasan. J commences east of Qum and stretches east to the boundary of Turshiz, fully 200 miles. Its width varies from 80 to 150 miles. It is composed of dark soil andJL 25 is covered in some places with a thick salt efflorescence which glitters painfully to the eyes. It is absolutely destitute of all sign of vegetation and of animal life The surface of the kavir is honey-combed with small holes about 9 inches deep and the size of a man s head which makes it very difficult going for animals. The soil binds well, and it should therefore be possible to construct a good road. When rain falls the surface becomes so slippery that camels cannot move. If the rain is heavy, the whole kavir become a sticky quagmire in which camels and men sink and cannot move. The kavir by no means occupies the whole extent usually shown on the map, but a large irregular area about the centre with some outlying portions; around the edges is sandy desert. The point of departure for caravans from the south is Jandak. Caravans cross here in winter with the utmost speed, in constant fear of being caught by rain. In summer the terrific heat prevents any cara van traffic. Dasht-i-Lut occupies a considerable tract in the south-east of Khorasan. Its area may be described as a parallelogram, the angles being marked by the town of Neh, Tahas, Yezd and Kerman. Owing to the absence of fresh water, the great heat and the existence of salt quagmires, the desert can be crossed only by following recognised caravan routes. It is practically impassable for troops except in very small bodies. 6. Railway system.—The only railways existing in Persia are (1) from Tabriz to Julfa, where it crosses the River Aras into Russian territory joining the rail way to Erivan and Elizavethopol; (2) from Duzdap (Sarhad) to Mirjawa and Nushki. _ For details of these railways see Chapter XVI, section B. 2. 7. Road system .—The chief roads in Persia capable ■of bearing motor transport are divided into two cate gories, (A) running north and south and (B) running ■east and west.26 A. North and south. L Qasr Shirin—Kermanshah—Hamadan—Kazvin— chief obstacles on this road are e aq-i-Girreh (Paitak), Asadabad, Aveh and Kuen passes. In the winter the three former are covered with snow, and in the months of January and Feb- ruary the Asadabad and Aveh passes have 12 to 18 feet of snow. The road is usually only closed for a lew clays at a time, narrow passages being made through the snow sufficient for one vehicle. The Kuen pass m liable m the winter and early spring to sudden storms. In the months of March and April the Mahidasht t0 Sar - i - Pu1 ’ th e Keffind and Plains become very muddy and water- !?f g • t? ^ sh ? ut . s are also frequent on the KarvimResht road m the vicinity of Rudbar.

It is now possible during the late spring, summer and autumn for iso lated lightly loaded cars to get from Tehran to Sultanabad. B. East and west. 1. Meshed, — Shahrud — Samnan — Tehran. —This road is very difficult owing to lack of work throughout its length. It is passable for isolated cars during the late spring, summer and autumn. In the early spring it becomes very muddy and “ wash outs ” are frequent. Extensive work would be required to make it passable for continuous heavy traffic. 2. Tehran — Kazvin — Siahdehan—Zinjan — M ianeh — Tabriz — Julfjx.—Fxora Tehran to Siahdehan this road is passable for all traffic throughout the year; slight “ wash outs ” may occur between Tehran and Kazvin during the spring. The only metalled portions of this road are between Kazvin and Siahdehan, and between Tabriz and Julfa. From Siahdehan to Jemalabad (at foot of Kaflan Kuh pass) the road is undulating and waterlogged in wdnter and spring. The Kaflan Kuh and Shibli passes are steep and formidable obstacles; all cars have to be man-handled over both. From Fiahdehan to Tabriz the road becomes very muddy and waterlogged during winter and early spring. This section of the road would not carry motor lorries without a considerable amount of work. From Tabriz to Julfa the metalling has fallen into disrepair. 3. Julfa — Khoi — Ma,hu. —From Julfa to Khoi this is a first class metalled road constructed during the war by the Russians and little used. A few minor culverts throughout the road and one bridge between Avoglu and Khoi have fallen into disrepair; hence the road at present (October 1924) will only take up to L. A. M. cars; repairs are in progress, and the road will soon be fit for all traffic. From Khoi to Maku there is a well graded but unmetalled motor road fitfor traffic up to L. A. M. cars; in the spring this por tion would be exceedingly difficult owing to mud and “ wash outs.” Note. —A motor road similar to the section between Khoi and Maku is in process of construction between U rumieh—S almas—Khoi. 4. Ramadan — Daulatabad — Sultanabad — Qum — Tehran. —This road is passable in the late spring, summer and autumn by lightly loaded cars in small numbers. 5. Saidabad — Kerman. —This road was constructed by the South Persia Rifles, but has been allowed to fall into disrepair. Note. —The Persian Government intends to construct a motor road from Tehran to Barfarush via Damavand and Piruzkuh. Lack of money has obliged work to be stopped on this road which is passable for motor traffic as far as Damavand. The above are the chief roads passable for wheeled traffic. Pack transport is extensively used, and is the sole means of transport in the more mountainous por tions of the country. 8. Telegraph system. —There are three separate tele graph administrations in Persia— t (a) The Indo-European Telegraph Department, a British Government institution. (&amp;) The Indo-European Telegraph Company, at British Company. (c) The Persian Telegraph Administration, under the Persian Ministry of Posts and Tele graphs. These three administrations have lines as under: — (a) (1) Central Persian line. Tehran—Qum Kashan — Khalidabad — Ardistan—Yezd— Kerman—Bam—Kuh-i-Malik Siah, a-nd thence to Quetta and Karachi. This line connects with the Persian Gulf Ports from Ardistan vid Isfahan—Shiraz to Bushire and from Kerman to Bandar Abbas. From Bushire and Bandar Abbas submarine cables govia Jask to Karachi. From Jask to Karachi there is also a land line via Charbar. (2) Meshed—Birjand—Kuh-i-Malik Siah. ' (3) Arabistan lines. Bushire—Ahwaz—Dizful— Sus, and Ahwaz—Muhammerah. Main tained by the Department on behalf of and at the expense of the Persian Government. A submarine cable leads from Bushire to Fao. The Department has also a friendly arrangement with the Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs by which it controls and inspects the Persian Tele graph Administration line from Tehran to Meshed. (&amp;) Tehran—Tabriz—Julfa, thence via Erivan, Sukkhum, Odessa and Emden to London. Control stations exist at Zinjan and Mianeh. (c) Most of the big towns have offices of the Persian Telegraph Administration. Messages sent by this route are apt to be delayed owing to slow transmission. Submarine cables connect Fao, Bushire, Henjam, Jask, Muscat and Karachi. These are adminis tered by the Indo-European Telegraph Depart ment. Wireless stations administered by the Indo- European Telegraph Department, exist at Bushire, Henjam and Lingah. The Russian Consulate at Enzeli and the Russian Legation at Tehran each have wireless stations. The French and German Legations at Tehran have receiving stations for taking press news. These stations at foreign Legations and Consulates are private. 9. Telephone system. —Persia is practically without telephones. There are local telephone services in the towns of Tehran, Kazvin, Zinjan and Tabriz, which however are unsatisfactory. TJhe toll houses on the Qasr Shirin—Enzeli road are connected by telephone. 10. Features of military importance. —Persia, being a mountainous country devoid of railways and with30 few roads, the chief features of importance are the mountain ranges and the passes by which they are crossed. Forces advancing from the south from the direction of Bushire or Khaniqin, or from the north from the direction of Resht, would find in their advance transverse mountain ranges crossed by passes which afford great opportunities for a protracted defence. The Manjil bridge between Kazvin and Resht is a most important point, as it provides the sole means by which troops can cross the feafid Rud in large numbers. The Darreh-i-Diz defile, 8 miles south of Julfa, provides a good first line of defence for troops protecting Persia from an advance from the north west. 11 . Population .—No official census of Persia has been taken since the passage of the Bonitcheh law in 1842. This fact, combined with the suspicion with which an attempt to ascertain accurate figures would be regard ed, make it impossible to arrive at any accurate re sult. A probable estimate is 10 millions; of which one half are rural, one quarter nomad and one quarter urban. 12. Ethnography.—'Yhe Persian people is divided into a considerable number of distinct tribes, which may be conveniently divided into Persian, Turki and Arabic speaking. Turki-speaking tribes are found extending from Azerbaijan through the northern pro vinces of Persia to Turkistan; a few of these go as far south as Hamadan. Persian-speaking tribes in habit the greater part of the country, but the chief tribes have dialects of their own which differ very considerably from each other. The country north and west of Kermanshah is inhabited by Kurds and Sinjabis, who, in addition to Persian, speak their own dialects of Kurdi. Working south-ea,st from these one finds the Lurs of Pusht-i-Kuh; these are succeeded further to the south-east by the Bakhtiaris and Qashqais. All of these tribes have their own tribal dialects. Khuzistan il inhabited by Arabic-speaking Arabs skin to the Mesopotamian Arabs. South-East Persia is peopled by Baluchis.All of the tribes are much divided by sectional and family feuds; and most of the important tribes are at enmity with their neighbours. The following table shows the more important tribes with the locality which they inhabit: — Tribe. Locality. Kurds PorfO-Tuikish, and Pcrso-Iraq frontiers west of Urumieh and west of Kermanshah. Slialisevans Ardebil district. Turkomans Asla^abad ; Bujuurd. Lurs . Burnjird ; Khurramubad. Bakhtiari . West of Isfahan. Arabs Khujistan. Qa-hqai &gt; Kuhg du ) Norta-West and North of Shiraz. Kkamsek S.-E. of Shiraz. Baluchis E. and S.-E. Persia and the Sarha&lt;3. It will thus be seen that the Persian tribes show Iranian, Turanian and Arab stock. Mongolian types are also found among the Hazaras who inhabit the Perso-Afghan frontier south-east of Meshed. The tribes are frequently found to have sections in localities far from the main body of the tribe. For example, Kurds are found in Khorasan whither they were transported by Shah Abbas as a defence against the raiding Turkomans. In addition there is a considerable resident foreign population composed for the most part of Armenians. These are mostly found in Julfa (Azerbaijan), Tabriz and Isfahan (Julfa) where they were transported from Julfa of Azerbaijan by Shah Abbas. There are also Armenian villages scattered throughout North Persia, and most large towns have a proportion of Armenian shopkeepers. The village Armenians are for the most part engaged in agriculture, and meet with consider able oppression. In Gilan and Azerbaijan there is a large and fluctuating population of Caucasians.32 * The urban population of Persia are exclusively artisans and small traders and belong to the Iranian stock. The rural population is agricultural, and according to its locality belongs to Iranian, Turanian or Arab stock. The tribes, which for the most part are nomadic, possess large herds by which they gain their livelihood. 13. National character .—The chief national charac teristics are indolence and corruption, mixed with considerable conceit. The majority of the upper classes live a life of indolence and corruption is notice able throughout all classes. Years of despotic oppress ion have caused them to become servile to superiors and arrogant to inferiors, while at the same time they are slow to resist any excess of authority. Venereal disease is rife in all large towns and most villages. None of the Persians can be called brave; the best fighting material comes from the nomadic tribes, parti cularly the Kurds and Lurs, and from the rural Azerbaijani-Turk population. At present these tribes would only engage in guerilla warfare in the vicinity of their homes, and intertribal and family feuds would determine the number of men to be put into the field. It is the intention of the War Minister gradually to disarm these tribes and from them to draw recruits for the army. Up to the present the Shahsevans are the only tribe which has been defeated and disarmed; it is probable also that this disarma ment is more partial than real. The Persian is polite and hospitable, but vain, un reliable and unpractical, with a great flair for in trigue ; grave in speech, eager to make promises which he has no intention of keeping, cowardly in action, quick to take up new ideas but lacking in the energy and perseverence necessary to carry matters through; an adept at procrastination, but quick witted and thus easily led by demagogues. 14. Religion. —The large majority of Persians pro fess the Shia branch of the Muhammadan faith; the Kurds, however, and a proportion of the inhabitants of Azerbaijan are Sunnis.Note. —The chief difference between these two sects is that the Shias state that Ali is the immediate suc cessor of Muhammad, and refuse to acknowledge Abu Bekr, Omar and Osman as Caliphs. The Sunnis, on the other hand, acknowledge these three as Caliphs and place Ali as the fourth Caliph. Bahaism, in spite of continual persecution, is mak ing rapid strides in Persia. This may be described as a non-conformist, puritanical, though more tolerant, sect of the Shia faith. It was founded in 1844 by one Mirza Ali Muhammad, known as the “ Bab ” (Gate). {Note. —This sect was formerly called “ Babis ”)• Considerable persecution of the new sect followed, and the “ Bab ” was executed at Tabriz in 1849. His suc cessors were Mirza Hussain Ali Bahaullah, who died in 1892, and Abdul Baha, who died at Haifa in 1921. There have been no official persecutions by the Persian Government for the last 45 years, but Shia fanaticism leads to frequent anti-Bahai outbreaks; the faith therefore is professed in secret. Persons pro fessing this faith are generally found to be more honest and law abiding than other Muhammadans. Armemans.—These all belong to the Armenian church which is allied to the Greek Orthodox church. Chaldeans .—A few Chaldeans are found in the vicinity of Lake Urumieh; these are Christians with a church of their own, but are rapidly becoming con verts to the Koman church. Jews. —Most towns have a number of Jews, and in the larger towns there are considerable colonies with their own priests and synagogues. In the whole of Persia there are between 20 and 30 thousand, for the most part engaged in trade. They are frequently the objects of fanatical outbursts. Zoroastrians .—Owing to continual persecutions few of the descendants of the old Persian fire-worshippers remain in Persia. The chief communities are in Yezd and Kerman where they are engaged in trade. 15. Education .—Education in Persia is in an ex tremely backward state; the mullahs, who hold most c 234 of the posts as teachers, are not anxious to see much progress for fear that it may undermine their own position. In Tehran there is a “ Dar-el-Fanun ” (Polytechnic institute) at which there are a few foreign professors, and in Tehran, Tabriz, Isfahan and other large towns there are schools run by British or American missionaries. Most Persians of the upper classes have received a portion of their education abroad, and those who can afford it send their sons to foreign countries, chiefly France or Switzerland, for their education. The present Cabinet of Reza Khan is trying to spread and improve elementary education throughout the country. Female education is unknown; and, Persia being a bigotted Muhammadan country, women are kept in strict seclusion./ * lud own in' iigs tier or iper tion ions _ lad, lezs ary g» in 36 CHAPTER III. The Constitution and System of Government. The Persian Government has for the last eighteen years been a limited monarchy. Prior to 1906 the Shah was absolute; he had under him ministers to deal with the various departments of State, but in all matters his will was law, and the people had no voice in their Government. The Ministers were in all cases members of the nobility, and for the most part merely took office to line their own pockets. The growth of democracy throughout the east, more particularly in Turkey, was anxiously watched by the young democrats of Persia, and popular discontent against the Shah’s ministers increased rapidly until in 1906 the Shah was forced to grant a Constitution. In January 1907 Muzaffar-ed-Din Shah died, and was succeeded by his son, Muhammad Ali Shah, who aimed at being an autocratic despot; in June 1908 he carried out a coup d’etat, bombarded the Majlis, and abolished the Constitution. Grave disturbances broke out in the provinces, notably in Tabriz, where the Constitu tionalists held out for a considerable time against the Royalist troops, until the siege was eventually raised by Russian troops. In 1909 the Bakhtiaris of Isfahan revolted, and together with the Constitutionalists from Resht advanced on Tehran. That town was cap tured, and Muhammad Ali forced to abdicate. He was succeeded by his son Ahmad Mirza, a minor, who again granted the Constitution. Muhammad Ali during the period 1910-13 made various attempts to recover his throne which ended in failure. He remained in Russia in receipt of a pension from the Persian Government. The Majlis (or Parliament) is elected by popular secret ballot, each Majlis sitting for two years from the date of its assembly. It is the sole authority with power to alter the Constitution, is in complete control of the Cabinet, and is the sole legislative authority. In practice it is found that an energetic Prime36 Minister can frequently force a Majlis to pass or reject a measure by methods which fall little short of actual coercion. Decrees of the Majlis require the signature of the sovereign. The Cabinet, composed of approximately eleven members, is formed by the Prime Minister with the approval of the Shah and the Majlis. It has only executive power, and is responsible for its actions to the Majlis. The Shah .—The dynasty is guaranteed by the Constitution to the Qajar family; the sovereign must belong to the Shia faith. On accession the Shah is required to swear an oath of fidelity to the Constitu tion in the presence of the Majlis; he is not respon sible to the Majlis, but has no legislative authority. The original Constitution made provision for the formation of a Senate, or second chamber. This was to be formed of sixty members, half nominated by the Shah, and the other half elected from Tehran and the provinces. Owing to the opposition of the democrats, who considered that the Senate would nullify the power of the Majlis, this chamber has never been assembled. Provincial governors are appointed by the Shah on the recommendation of the Cabinet. The various government departments have subordi nate officials in the provinces who perform the local duties of the department concerned./ 37 CHAPTER IV. Material Resources. 1. Finances .—The chief sources of Persian revenue y.re : — (а) Customs. (б) Land tax. (c) Excise dues (opium and tobacco). (d) Posts and Telegraphs. (e) Leases for concessions. Although since the arrival of the American financial mission under Dr. Millspaugh in 1922, the Persian budget has gradually been made to balance, yet there is no capital in the country with which to carry out any of the very necessary improvements. The T ersian Government for some time past has tried_ to raise the necessary money in the form of a foreign loan guaranteed by the Northern Oil concession; up to October 1924, however, no power had shown itself willing to advance such a loan. Persian finances, therefore, remain in a somewhat precarious condition. 2. Agriculture .—Considerable agricultural work is •carried on in the northern, central and western provinces. This, however, generally is only sufficient for local requirements, with the exception of the Caspian provinces, where there is usually a surplus exported to Russia. Owing to lack of intercommuni cation between the various parts of the country this surplus cannot be made use of to feed other less fortunate parts of the country. Wheat amd barley are chiefly grown on the plateau, and rice in the Caspian provinces; all fruits are plentiful. A con siderable export trade in dried fruits is carried on between Azarbaijan and the Caucasus. Sheep are plentiful in the mountains and on the central plateau. 3. Industries .—No organised industries worthy of the name exist in Persia. The carpet industry, which in the large majority of cases is a home industry, has38 greatly deteriorated owing to the advent of the ani line dye. Small potteries exist in Quin and Isfahan, which, however, are of purely local importance. Attempts are being made to start a weaving industry in Isfahan with machinery imported from Germany, and the Russians are showing considerable interest m the cotton growing of Mazanderan; the proviso being that all cotton so grown is to be exported to Russia. The timber trade which was carried on between the Caspian provinces and Russia has con siderably deteriorated owing to lack of attention to the forests, and to the absence of any proper work, subsequent to the Russian revolution. Forests are plentiful on the northern slopes of the Elburz. An extensive fishing industry is in existence on the south shores of the Caspian. This, prior to 1917, was owned by Messrs. Lianosov. On the conclusion of the Russo-Persian treaty of 1921, it was nominally returned to Persia, but actually is still worked by the Russians. wea lth .—The most important mineral wealth of Persia is oil which exists in large quantities in Arabistan and in the vicinity of Qasr Shirin, at both of which points the Anglo-Persian Oil Company have considerable workings. Oil is also believed to exist in the northern provinces, but as yet no borings have been made as the concession for these provinces has not been granted up to the present. Coal exists in large quantities in the Elburz Mountains, but the lack of means of intercommunica- tion enhances the difficulty of its distribution. The methods of mining are most primitive. Iron and copper are found in small quantities in Mazanderan, Rhamseh and Khalkhal. 5. Commerce and Shiyving is chiefly an importing country. _ The main exports are dried fruit from Azarbaijan, rice and wood from the Caspian provinces, and oil from Arabistan. Mercantile shipping is limited to small country sailing boats plying on the Caspian Sea.7 X- 39 «, Animal transport. —Persia, having no railways except the short lines from Julfa to Tabriz and f ro ™- Duzdap to Mirj awa, is entirely dependent on animat transport. Local transport is good and plentitui, particularly in the larger towns, although somewhat fluctuating in quantity according to the season o± the year. The chief means of transport are horse-dra.wn carts and pack caravans composed of ponies, mules, camels or donkeys. Of these the quickest are horse- drawn carts and mules. Persian horses, although small, are hardy and well suited to the stony country. Owing to the lack ol attention to the old horse breeding farms, both the quantity and the quality have deteriorated. Ihe best horses come from Azarbaijan and Arabistan ; a bigger breed comes from the steppes of Turkistan, but is less suited to hard work. Persia does not breed sufficient horses to provide an adequate supply of suitable remounts for any large force. 7. Mechanical transport in Persia is practically negligible. The Persian army possesses a few Penz lorries and Citroen tractors, and civil mechanical transport is limited to a small number of vehicles belonging to the Eastern and Nairn Transport Com panies (located at Baghdad) plying between Tehran and Khaniqin, and to a few old lorries belonging to smaller firms in Tehran. Most large towns contain contractors owning a variable quantity of touring cars, principally Fords. Such transport would be extreme^ unreliable.40 CHAPTER V. Recruiting and Man-Power. 1. Law of military service .—The present system of recruitment in the Persian army is based on the Bonitcheh Law ” of 1842 by which the number of men to be found by each District for military service was calculated on the amount of land under cultivation. As far as possible, recruits are taken from tribes and districts which have been assessed in accordance with this law. Where the assessment according to the Bonitcheh Law coincides with the number of recruits required from a given district, all are taken; where greater, the recruits are chosen by lot; but in cases wdiere the number of men required is more than the assessment, the deficiency is made good from men of another district. this law also provides that the persons who introduce a recruit, and the elders and headmen of his village, are bound to stand surety for his good behaviour and to give compensation, should any loss of stores or equipment occur through the negligence or desertion of the individual. . 2 - Terms of service and period of iramtnfir.—Recruits for admission to the Persian army have to fulfil the following conditions : — (а) be Muhammadans (б) be Persia^ subjects (c) be between 18 and 20 years of age {d) be medically fit (e) not be opium-takers. The normal period of service for the soldier with the colours is two years in the infantry and thres years in the cavalry or artillery, after which periods a man is entitled to his discharge. This rule is at present not observed, as the requisite strength of divisions has not yet been attained. As a result men cannot in actual practice obtain their discharge after ■completion of these terms of service.Officers and N. C. Os. are long-service men and may qualify for pensions as shown m Chapter AAl . 3. Recruiting organisations.— are collecte bv a system of recruiting parties which are sent out to the various districts by the Divisional Commanders in accordance with orders issued from time to time y iL Ministry of War. The normal composition of these recruiting parties is. (а) an officer in command, (б) an officer appointed by the recruiting depart ment of the Divisional stau, (c) a representative of the Civil Governoi, (d) a medical officer, (e) a; clerk. Should any district be found depopulated or impoverished; and this condition be confirmed by the local employee of the Finance Department, the War Ministry can remit wholly or m part the Bomtch levy for such period as the impoverished conditi lasts. Recruits are then drawn from places capa lie of bearing the levy. A recruiting party brings in its recruits to Divi sional Headquarters where they are inspected, en rolled and drafted to units. 4. Recruiting Statistics and Reserves available Levee en masse.—Correct and up-to-date recru ^ting statistics are impossible to obtain. It is ^ry proba , that the Persian authorities themselves do not know the correct number of recruits which any one district should be called upon to provide, as , no . r a e ™ nffice re-assessment of the Bonitcheh Law has taken place since it was first passed in 1842. No organised system of reserves equivalent to the systems which hold in European armies as yet exists iu Persia. The most important reserves which could be drawn upon are the irregular tribesmen. I he number of men which would be put in the field by any group of tribes is impossible to estimate, as the distance of the theatre of war from the home of the tribe, inter-tribal jealousies and feuds, would all have an important bearing on the subject. Estimates ot4iJ the fighting strengths of the tribes vary considerably , u 1 of tlie Anglo-Persian Military Conven- tion (mo) puts the strength at 300,000 men. At the present moment, the War Minister (Reza Khan) is endeavouring to get the whole country under the com plete control of the Central Government. This will take time and, until it is completed, no accurate statistics can be obtained of the number of men likely to be put m the field by any tribe. 7 tl'nV P 1925 the passed a Conscrip. reachfnl 2 T ve«r^?° 8eS mi S ary Service on males reacning 21 years of age, with certain exceptions, ie priests, the disabled, certain classes of students and those on whom others are dependent.

Combatant Oncers.—The officers at present serv ing in the re-organised Persian Army consist of three classes :— (a) Officers who served in the Cossack Division and former Persian Army. (b) Officers who were transferred from the Gendarmerie to the Army on the disband ment of the former in 1922, or who joined from the South Persiai Rifles on its dis bandment. (c) Junior officers who have joined the Army direct. The ranks of military officers are: — Persian rank. Equivalent British rank. Naib Sewum. Naib Dowum. Naib Awwal. . Sultan. Yawar. Naib Sarhang. Sarhang. Sartip. Amir Lashkar. Sipahbod. Farmandeh Kul Qushun. 2. Technical and Special 2nd Lieutenant. Lieutenant. Captain. Major. Lieut. -Colonel. Colonel. Colonel Commandant. Divisional Commander. Corps Commander. Commander-in-Chief. Officers .—Technical officers re mostly recruited from persons who have obtained desrree at a school or university in the requ rod •ienra There is, however, a veterinary school at iich veterinary Officers are trained for the require- ients of the army.44 Technical officers have the same grades as combatant officers with the addition of the words “ medical ” or “ veterinary 3, Training of candidates for combatant commis sions^. —There is in Tehran a cadet school of about 200 cadets which accepts pupils from the age of 7. Not all of these receive commissions, but some enter civil professions. The school is divided into three parts: — I. Primary School. —For pupils of 7-12 years of age. In each day’s work, one hour is allotted to military exercises and five to lessons. II. Intermediate School. —For pupils of 13—19 years of age. The school is open to: — (a) Pupils between the ages of 13 and 19 who have passed their elementary standards. {b) Sons of officers who fulfil certain conditions. The allotment of working hours is as for the Primary School. III. Cadet College. —For pupils of 17—20 years of age. One day in the week is set apart for musketry and field sketching instruction on the ground. In the day, five hours are set apart for lectures* three for drill, three for preparation, three for food and recreation and eight for sleep. Candidates for entry to the Cadet College must be either : — (a) students from the Intermediate School who have passed out in a satisfactory manner, or {b) persons who hold a diploma from the intermediate grade of the polytechnic institute; or (c) persons who hold a satisfactory certifi cate, after attending for four years, from an intermediate school in Persia or from a foreign school of corresponding grade. Such persons have to pass a competitive examination before entry.On entering the college, candidates have to pass the medical examination for admission to the Army. Successful candidates for admission are required to give an undertaking that after receiving their commissions they will serve for at least six years in the Army. Education is much hampered by the lack of up to date text books. At General Headquarters there is an officers’ school which junior officers attend. The length of . the course is one year, with a complement of 120 students. When an officer passes out of the officers’ school, should there be no vacancy for him, he is placed on the unemployed list pending a vacancy. Officers are placed on this list if any period elapses between relin quishing one appointment and taking up another. 4. Reserve Officers.— retirement, officers are placed,on the reserve list for five years during which time they may be called up if required. As yet no organised scheme exists for the supply of additional officers in time of war. 5. Retirement of oncers.—The retirement of officers is effected after the undernoted periods of service with the colours :— Rani. Period. Officers telow field rank Yawar Naik Sarliang Sarhang Sartip . Amir Higher ranks 9. Non-Commissioned Officers. ETon-commissioned officers are promoted from the ranks. Each Division has a school for Non-commissioned officers, at which courses varying from 6 months to one year are held. at 45 years of age. „ 50 „ 55 „ 60 „ 62 ,, 65 ,, .. 6846 There is also a Non-Commissioned officers’ school at Tehran. To enter the latter, candidates must fulfil the following conditions: — (a) Be Persian subjects. (b) Belong to the Muhammadan religion. (c) Be between the ages of 18 and 25. (d) Have a knowledge of Persian and a little arithmetic. The length of the course for literate students is one j^ear, and for illiterate, two years.

Peace strength and organisation. —Persia is divided into five divisional areas in accordance with the table below. Each divisional area has one lashkar (Division) of troops with a separate divisional staff. The Army Headquarters is situated in Tehran. H eadquarters. Divl. name. TJivl. number. Tehran. Central. I Meshed. Eastern. II Isfahan. Southern. III Kermanshah. Western. IV Tabriz. North West. V There is, in addition, one independent brigade called the Northern Brigade with Headquarters at Resht which comprises in its area the Caspian littoral with the exception of Talish. A proposal has been made to raise this Brigade to a division. Each Division has a nominal strength of 10,000 men, but all are at present considerably under strength, the total strength of the Persian Army being 46,600 in July 1925. 2. War strength and organisation .— As far as is known, this is the same as the peace organisation as outlined above. Troops are moved from various divisions, as required, to deal with any disturbances as they may occur. 3. Composition of Army Headquarters. Minister of War. Military Secretary’s Branch. High Military Council (Plan and Policy). Control. Finance Department. I General Staff. Accounts. 1 Administration Disbursements Receipts. r Adjutant General. Operations Military Intelligence. Q- ' .f — Veterinary. A. D. C. 1 Medical.48 The High Military Council plays a real part in advising the Commander-in-Chief on plans and military policy. It is composed of senior officers of experience, and the Commander-in-Chief is consider ably guided by its recommendations. 4. Composition of a Corps. —No composition is known to be laid down for a Corps (Sepah). The name “ Sepah ” is applied to a force of two or more Divisions (Lashkar) when acting together. 5. Composition of a Division .— Each Division (.Lashkar) has a nominal establishment of 10,000 men composed of 10 Faujs (Regiment). One fauj in each lashkar is a cavalry fauj, with the exception of the Southern (Illrd) and North West (Vth) lashkars which have 2 cavalry faujs each. One fauj in each lashkar is an artillery fauj. One fauj in each lashkar is an engineer fauj, in which is incorporated the signal service. 6. Composition of a Brigade .— Two to four faujs form one brigade (Tip). No establishments are laid dowm for it. 7. Mobilisation. —No mobilisation plans exist. Absence of railways and bad roads make concentra tion slow and difficult.CHAPTER VIII. Administration, Commands and Staff. 1 . Administrative Districts. —For the purpose ol military administration, Persia is divided into dis tricts as shown in Chapter VII, para. 1 . 2 . System of administration. —Each Division and the Independent Brigade has its own separate staff, which deals direct with the General Staff at Tehran. 3. Military Councils. —Under the Minister of War is a branch called the “ High Military Council ”, the duty of which is to deal with all questions of policy and with all plans. 4 . The Ministry of TFar.—For table showing the branches of the Ministry of War see Chapter VII, para. 3. 5 . Higher Command. —See Chapter VII, para. 3. 6 The General Staff. —For division of the General Staff see Chapter VII, para. 3. The Chief of the General Staff holds the rank of Sipahbod and the Deputy Chief of Staff that of Sartip. 7. Administrative and technical staffs. —These exist solely as a branch of the General Staff. See table, Chapter VII, para. 3. 8 . Military Attaches. —Persia has two Military Attaches accredited to Foreign powers, one at Angora and one at Moscow. The present incumbent at Angora is Sarhang Salar Nizam, an officer of strong pro- Bolshevik tendencies who previously served in the Gendarmerie. During the war he ^ was one of the Gendarmerie officers who fought against the Russians in Persia; he also served wdth the Turkish forces and holds the Turkish Gallipoli Star. Sarhang Hisn-ed- Douleh, at present at Moscow, is believed shortly to be returning to Tehran. 9 . Divisional Staffs a're divided into separate departments dealing with operations, recruiting, supply, transport, finance, law and ordnance. The officer in charge of the Amnieh (road guards) is also attached to the divisional • staff. D 250 10 . The chain of command in the field .—This leads down from the High Military Council, through the General Staff in Tehran, to the Divisional Staff; thence to the Brigade staff (if brigades exist) or direct to Regimental staffs. The Northern Independent Brigade (Headquarters, Resht) deals direct with the General Staff. 11 . Intelligence Corps .—The Intelligence Depart ment exists as a separate branch of the General Staff and has an officer on each divisional staff.51 CHAPTER IX. Infantry. 1 . Organisation of the arm. —The Persian infantry is organised into Regiments (Fauj) the composition of which is given in the tables below. In the model organisation of the Persian Army, each lashkar (Division) is to contain seven Infantry Faujs (Regi ments) with the exception of the Southern (Illrd) and North West (Vth) Lashkars which each, having an extra Fauj of cavalry, are to contain only six Infantry Faujs. Owing to the fact that the Persian Army is not yet recruited up to its establishment, divisions as yet do not contain their full proportions of troops of all arms. 2 . Organisation of an infantry regiment.—-The -organisation of an infantry fauj (regiment) is as follows :— The established strength per fauj is: — (а) 4 Field officers. ( б ) 79 junior officers. (c) 1,853 other ranks consisting of (i) Regimental staff and band. (ii) 3 gurdan '(battalions), each gurdan con sisting of 4 guruhan (companies). The 1st Battalion in each fauj consists of : — 2 rifle companies. 1 grenadier company. 1 M. G. company. The 2nd and 3rd Battalions.—^eh consists of : — 3 rifle companies. 1 Lewis Gun company. A fauj is commanded by a Sarhang, a gurdan by a Naib Sarhang or Yawar, a guruban by a Sultan.5G 3. Organisation of a company — 2—4 redif (files) = 1 jouqeh (section) commanded by sirjouqeh (Cpl.). 2—4 jouqeh = l resat (platoon) commanded by Wakil Hast or Wakil Chap ( 1 st and 2 nd Sergts.). 2—4 resat = 1 guruhan (company) commanded by Sultan (Capt.) or Naib Awwal (Lieut.). The 1 st half-coy. (platoons 1 and 2 ) and the 2 nd half-coy. (platoons 3 and 4) are com manded by a Wakil Bashi (Sergt.-Major), Mu’in Naib (W.O.) or Naib Sewwum. 4. Regimental specialists. —The only regimental specialists are the machine and Lewis gunners. See tables above. 5. Designations of units and regimental colours .— All regiments have been named, and a scheme has recently been brought in by -which dll units of the various arms have in addition consecutive numbers throughout the army. Details of these numbers have not yet been obtained. The following table shows the identified names of infantry regiments by divisions in July 1925. I {Central) Division — 1 st Pehlevi. J 2 nd Bahadur. &gt; Tehran Brigade. Ahan. J Spur (Ahmedi). } Ara « h Bri S ade - Northern Independent Brigade — Roin. Sepahpur. 77 {Eastern) Division — 25th Keiani. 26th Zabuli.III {Southern) Division — Silahshur. Razamjan. 22nd Infantry Regiment. 23rd Infantry Regiment. Mausuri. Shahpur. IV (Western) Division — Fadawi. Selahkhor. V (North West) Division— 13th Azar. 14th Akhgar. 15th Sepahban. Each Gurdan (Battalion) carries a coloured flag of about 2 feet square with the name of the battalion in Persian characters. This is carried by one of the Non-Commissioned Officers attached to his bayonet. Each fauj (regiment) has a regimental colour carried by an officer. This, however, is carried only on ceremonial parades, whereas the battalion llag is carried on all occasions. 6 . Regimental transport—The only regimental transport is one travelling kitchen and one light cart tor the collection of wounded per battalion. Owing to the shortage of stores units have not the full com plement. Transport of kit, etc., is done by the allot ment of transport by the Transport or by commandeer ing local transport. 7 Armament—(a) Geweroi.—Officers and senior Non-Commissioned Officers of infatatry units carry a sword and a revolver or automatic pistol: junior Non-Commissioned Officers and men, a rifle ami bayonet. Men of machine and Lewis gun detach ments are armed with carbines. ( 6 ) The rifle .—The pattern of rifle in use in the Persian Army varies considerably. The Russian rifle58 \ is most common, but British, German and Turkish are all in use, together with a number of Lebel carbines taken over from the Gendermerie on the disbandment cu the latter. Efforts at the present moment are being made to arm each Division with one pattern of rifle. (c) Pistol. ^The pattern of pistol in use varies con siderably, each officer suiting hi s own convenience, the one most favoured is the Mauser. {d) Bayonet .—infantryman carries a bayonet to suit the pattern of rifle with which he happens to be armed. In accordance with the Bussian practice, the oayonet is always fixed. s 8 . Equipment.—The normal marching order equip ment of the Persian infantry is :— rifle with fixed bayonet, bandolier containing 60 rounds, belt with bayonet scabbard, haversack, pack, waterbottle, one blanket carried en banderole, one small shovel or pick. (No other tools carried). Binoculars, which are mostly private property, are carried by all officers. §. Ammunition.—Other than the ammunition in the bandolier there is no company or regimental reserve of ammunition. Ammunition now in possession of the Persian army is short in quantity and old. 10 . Grenades. Owing to the shortage of material no grenades have as yet been issued to grenadier companies. gieuauieiCHAPTER X. Machine Guns and Automatic Rifles. ' 1 . General organisation and strength of arm. —In. the model organisation of the Persian Army there is supposed to be one machine gun company in each infantry fauj, each company having 16 guns. The actuality, however, fails far short of this ideal, as in the entire Persian Army, there are, according to the latest information available, only some 161 service able M. G.s out of a probable total of 185. The patterns of guns vary considerably, there being Vickers, Maxim and Russian M. G.s in use at the same time. 2 . Machine Gun Companies. —See Chapter IX, para. 3. 3 . Lewis Gun Units. —In each infantry fauj there are supposed to be two Lewis gun companies, each having 16 Lewis guns. The shortage of equipment affects this as it does all other branches of the Persian Army, and no one company has its full com plement of'guns. For strength and organisation of Lewis Gun com panies, see Chapter IX, para. 2 . Many different patterns of light automatic weapons are in use—Lewis guns, Russian light automatic rifles, Cost and other patterns are all found. 4 . Personnel of machine and Lewis gun companies are armed and equipped similarly to the personnel of rifle companies, except that they carry carbines in place of rifles, and no bayonets.GO CHAPTER XL Cavalry. 1 . General Organization. —In the model organization of the Persian Army there is one Cavalry Fauj (Regi ment) in each lashkar (division). The III (South ern) and V (North-West) lashkars are, however, exceptions to this rule, and have two cavalry fauj each. 2 . Organization of the Regiment. —The fauj is made up of two Gurdan-i-Sovmr (squadron) each of which is composed of tw T o Bahaduran (troop). The strength of each regiment is approximately 10 officers and 400 men. 3. Divisional Cavalry. —Is not provided for in the establishment of the Persian Army. 4. Designations of units and regimental colours .— The following table shows names of regiments by divi sions as identified up to July 1925. I (Central) Division — Sangin Aslaheh. Hand eh. Nusrat. F a'teh. Northern Independent Brigade —Pouladin. 7i (Eastern) Division — 21 st Bahrami. 22 nd Khosrui. This Division also contains a force of approxi mately 700 camel sowars. III (Southern) Division — Abbasi. Safshikan. IV (Western) Division. —Muzaffar.V {North-West) Division — 9th Layamut. 10 th Qahraman. 11 th Cavalry. 12 th Cavalry. Each regiment on ceremonial parades carries a regimental standard. 5 . Regimental specialists. —None. When a suffi ciency of material is obtained in the Persian army it is intended to allot machine guns to cavalry regiments on the same lines as to infantry regiments. 6 . Regimental transport. —None. Transport is allotted as required by the Transport Corps. 7 . Equipment. —The marching order equipment of the Persian cavalryman is similar to that of the in fantryman, except that the bayonet is not carried, and wallets on the saddle are carried in place of the pack. 8 . Armament. —The normal armament of the Persian cavalry man is: — Lance; which is rested on the toe, no bucket being carried. Sabre; curved, cutting edge; worn on the left side, suspended from a belt passing over the right shoulder. Rifle; carried slung. Bandolier; containing sixty rounds. All officers and senior N. C. Os. carry sabre and pistol. 9. Saddlery and Equipment. —The pattern of saddle in general use at present is the Cossack saddle, but it is intended to withdraw this and substitute for it a saddle similar in pattern to the British universal saddle. Officers in most cases own private saddles of British pattern.62 The pattern of bit in use varies considerably—from a plain watering snaffle to a British bit, portmouth reversible. 10 . Technical equipment. —Nil. 11 . The Cavalry Horse. —The horses are all stallions of about 14'2 and up to little weight. Although hard, they are badly groomed and unkempt, but can subsist for a long time on short rations. The amount of daily rations admissible for Govern ment animals is :— Lucerne 3 lbs. Chaff . 12 lbs. Barley . 6 lbs. The full ration, however, seldom reaches the horse, for which it is drawn.CHAPTER XII. Artillery. 1 . Organization and strength of arm .—In the model Persian Army one fauj in each lashkar is to be an Artillery fauj. There are many patterns of gun in use, including Russian Horse Artillery guns, Russian Field guns, Austrian Field guns, British 13 pounders, Russian mountain howitzers, Austrian and Russian mountain guns. The 137 guns at present in use are distributed as under :— I (Central) Division . Total II (Eastern) Division Total III (Southern) Division Total IV (Western) Division Total V (North-West) Division Total Northern Independent Brigade 6 field guns. 9 mountain guns. Total . 15 . 6 field guns. 14 horse artillery guns. 4 mountain howitzers. 4 mountain guns. . 28 . 8 field guns. 13 mountain guns. . 21 . 16 field guns. 22 mountain guns. . 38 . 6 field guns. 8 mountain guns. . 14 6 field guns. 15 mountain guns . 21 Gkand Total . 13764 In addition to the above there are an unknown num ber of guns in arsenals. Brigade organisation appears to exist only m the I (Central) Division where guns are grouped 4 or 6 -gun batteries (Atishbar), each of which is com manded by a Yawar with a Sultan as 2 ncl-in-com- mand • 2 to 4 batteries forming a regiment (I auj ),_ commanded by a Sarhang or Naib Sarhang, two of which constitute the Artillery brigade (lip). Batteries are moved from one division to another to meet existing requirements, and numbers of guns wit divisions, therefore, vary considerably. 2. Designations of butteries—The following table shows the designations by divisions of batteries identi fied up to October 1924: 7 {Central) Division — 1st Guard Battery ) Sowar Regiment. 2 nd Guard Battery ) Pehlevi Battery 2 nd Battery 3rd Battery 1st Kuhestani 2 nd Kuhestani 1 I Piadeh Regiment. j 7/ {Eastern) Division. —19th Regiment. V (North-West) Division .— 7th Regiment. 3. General .—The artillery arm of the Persian army is in a very backward condition. There is a conside able shortage of ammunition a^nd essentia! equipmerm It is probable that owing to these two factors and n addition to lack of training indirect fire could neier be carried out.CHAPTER XIII. Technical Troops. A. Engineers.—Ea,d\ lashkar contains one fauj of Engineers which includes signal and communication services. These engineer faujs are at present in pro cess of formation. They are, as yet, much under strength and possess very few engineering stores, and little technical knowledge. B. Pioneers. — -Nil. C. Chemical warfare. — Nil. D. Signal and communication services.—These are to be included in the engineer fauj of which there is to be one in each lashkar. The methods of communi cation used at present are confined to the existing civil telegraph services and messengers by car, on horse, and on foot. The helio is not used, but train ing in flag signalling by the semaphore system has commenced. There is a military wireless telegraph installation at Tehran w T hich was taken over from the former Cossack division. This has recently been repaired, but is little used and has a small sending range. There are also two small sets which were left behind by the Russian troops on their evacuation of Azerbaijan. It is in tended to use these for communication between Tehran and the seat of any military operations in Persia. Twelve sets were recently purchased from Russia. Of these one set is to be erected in Tehran and will, it is believed, be capable of communicating with Moscow, whilst the remaining eleven will be distributed amongst the provinces for internal communication within Persia. These sets have arrived in Tehran, but the w r ork of erecting the Tehran station only had been commenced at the end of 1924. No regimental signalling detachments exist.53 * CHAPTER XIV. • Tanks and Armoured Cars. 1 . Tanks. —The Persian War Ministry is reported to be negotiating for the purchase of six light tanks from the French Government. Four light tanks, probably of the Renault type, have already reached Persia. 2 . Armoured cars. —The Persian army possesses four Rolls Royce heavy armoured cars, which arrived in Bushire from England in 1924. These cars are located in Tehran under the command of a special officer who is directly under the War Ministry. They are at present in process of organisation as an armoured car company. The drivers of these cars ai*e Indians. They are inferior, and few of the personnel have any knowledge of armoured car tactics. Some of the cars were dam aged in the drive up from Bushire to Tehran, and owing to the lack of adequate repair shops and short age of spare parts it will be difficult to carry out proper repairs. An English mechanic trained by the Rolls Royce company is employed by the Persian War Ministry to supervise these cars, but he meets with considerable obstruction when attempting to work.CHAPTER XV. SlT'RVFY. 1 . Survey department .to the General Staff in Tehran is a map drawing department; later on it is intended to attach a snb-section of the department to Divisional Headquarters. 2 . Maps in use .—The only maps in use in the Persian army are those which have been copied from (a) Russian maps of various scales used by the Russian forces in Persia during the Great War, and (&amp;) British “ Degree sheets,” scale 1 inch = 4 miles, supplied to the Persian Government at the time of the projected Anglo-Persian agreement. The Persian Army possesses no personnel sufficiently highly trained to prepare accurate maps. 3. Meteorological sections. — Nil.CHAPTER XVI. Transportation. A. General. 1 . The transportation service in the Persian Army is in process of organisation. Each division has an officer on the headquarter staff in charge of the trans port which is divisionalised. The 1 st (Central) Divi sion is the only one in which the organisation has approached completion and here, as in all other divi sions, the greater part of the transport is raised locally as required. B. Railway. 1 . Railway personnel units .—No military railway personnel exists. 2 . Organisation of traffic: — Tabriz — Julfa; Tabriz — SharifTchaneh .—Condition of line had; all sleepers rotten and require replace ment in toto. Rolling stock as under, all in bad repair— 3 engines. 20 tank trucks. 40 flat trucks. 80 closed-in wagons. 7 carriages. There are also 3 unserviceable engines at Julfa. Over £ 100,000 would be required to put the line in good order. The Persian Government is now negoti ating to purchase some engines from Germany, and sleepers from Russia. i he personnel of the railway is discontented and practically useless. Service; two trains a week to and Horn Julfa, one a week to and from Sharifkhaneh. The bridge over the Aras at Julfa is intact and pass able by trains.69 Sl M Uahhteh-Maku^Baya 1 M.-T^Jr ^over the Arae at Shahtattteh has been 'ed^^ “stS, an^ for t-ough SaSVto —d, all sleepers and woodwork o± roiii g and engines overthrown. .Vote.—Information concerning the two above rati- ways was collected in August 1924. wa°s SA/aS™ati^e b^ w'ter both for ^Ivinkine and for locomotives.

C. Mechanical Transport. 1 . Fourteen Benz 3-ton lorries arrived in Tehran from Germany in 1924, as did also foi y g Lloyd 30 cwt. lorries with trailers. In addition, the Persian Army possesses a few Ford cars and also twelve Citroen tractors; these have proved unsatisfactory over the stony coun ry Persia. T). Horsed Transport. 1 The horse transport that exists m the Persian Army is divisiohalised, being under the control of a divisional transport officer on divisional H. y.The organisation is still very incomplete, most of the transport being hired locally as required. The 1st (Central) Division has about 200 carts. 2 . The type of transport cart in use is a country cart drawn generally by four horses, similar in appearance to an English hay waggon, but on a smaller scale. The colour of these carts is grey. E. Water Transport. 1 . Inland — Nil. 2 . Docks .—Persia owns no vessels capable of trans porting troops. Kazian (Enzeli) is the only Persian port on the Caspian where ships can load and unload alongside the wharf. At Bushire there is an outer and an inner anchor age, but the largest vessels which can enter the inner anchorage safely are those of 20 feet draught. Even these cannot approach the wharves, and all unloading is done from sea-going vessels into harbour boats which land the goods on the wharves. Some of the boats on Lake Urumieh, which pre viously belonged to private firms, have been taken over by the Persian Army which is at present forming a marine corps of 1,000 men.CHAPTER XVII. Intendance and Supply. 1 . General. —As yet no fixed establishment of supply personnel has been laid down for the Persian army. Each regiment has an officer of the Ordnance Depart ment (Mubashirat) attached, who, in conjunction with the officer commanding the regiment, is responsible for the arrangements for purchase or manufacture of clothing and for the purchase of rations. This post is much sought after, as it provides countless opportu nities for peculation and embezzlement. Each division has an officer in charge of supply attached to the divi sional headquarters. 2 . Supply in ihc field. —No organised arrange ments for supply in the field exist, the Persian army being accustomed to live on the country. 3. Scale of rations .— Man. —3 lbs. of bread and a bowl of soup issued twice a day. Morse. —Lucerne 3 lbs., Chaff 12 lbs., Barley 6 lbs. In both cases the full ration seldom reaches the man or animal for which it is drawn. 4. Travelling kitchens. —Each battalion is supposed to have one travelling kitchen. Owing to the short age of material the number is far short of establish ment. 5. Barracks. —Arrangements for care and upkeep of barracks are in the hands of the officer commanding, the troops in the barracks.72 CHAPTER XVIII. Medical. 1 . The Medical (Service is under the directorship of ■a branch of the General Staff. One stationary hospital is situated in Tehran. Each lashkar has a proportion of medical officers attached to it, and also one field hospital. Each company and equivalent unit contains a medi cal detachment. Each battalion has one light horse-drawn wagon for the carriage of wounded. Owing to shortage of stores it has not been found possible to issue the full estab lishment of these carts. 2 . The Medical Service, in common with all other branches of the Persian army, suffers much from short age of trained personnel and equipment. It is pro bable that in the event of a large number of casual ties, the medical service would be quite insufficient to cope with them. 3. The distinguishing mark borne on flags denoting Persian military hospitals is a “ Lion and Sun ” in red on a white ground. 4. In the year 1923 a society known as the “ Shir- o-Khurshid-i-Surkh ” (Red Lion and Sun) was started. This society, which is an imitation of “ Red Cross ” societies in European countries, is supported by voluntary contributions. Its objects are to supply the ti oops with extra medical comforts, and to register civilian doctors who in time of war would be ■willing to serve with the Persian regular forces.73 CHAPTER XIX. Veterinary Services. 1 . General -The Veterinary Corps is a separate department under a, distinct blanch General Staff on which there is - Directer of Veteri- nafv Services who is also the head of the Veteiirw y School in Tehran. From this school, veterinary officers and dressers are appointed to units. 2. Veterinary duties with the iroops.—In each Lashkar (Division) and in each Cavalry and Artil! y Tip (Brigade) there is one veterinary officei with the rank of Veterinary Naib Sarhang for the Lashkar and Veterinary Yawar for the Tip, respectively. Each Cavalry and Artillery Fauj (Regiment) has one vete- rinarv officer with the rank of Veterinary Naib Awwal or Veterinary Sultan and four veterinary dressers ranking as Vakils (Sergeants). The transport has a Proportion of veterinary officers. The infantry, as yet, have none, but, as more trained personnel becomes available, veterinary officers will be aPPO^ted to transport and infantry units to complete them up establishment. 3 Veterinary schools.-The school at which the vete- rinary personnel of the Persian Army is trained .8 situated in Tehran. The head of this school, who is also Director of Veterinary Services, is an officei wl has done a course in Austria and subsequently was chief veterinarv officer of the gendarmerie under the Swedish regimA Under him, to assist m the mstruc- tion n the school, are three officers who ^re rained by the original Swedish veterinary officer with the gendarmerie. This school is self-contained with kitnhens, mess rooms and living rooms for the students the H. L. ys. having one room and the officers cubicles containing four each. The school has two lecture rooms, a dissecting room, a dispensary and the necessary oPrices.'74 The school takes twenty officers and twenty-five- N. C. (3s. at a time, the former doing a two years* course, the latter a one-year course. Students are obtained from the schools and universities and not recruited direct from the Army as it is found that in this way only can students be found with a sufficiently high standard of knowledge to enable them to pass the entrance examination. The officers course is divided into four sessions of six months each, with a break of one fortnight. The working day is eight hours, of which three are devoted to lectures, and the remainder to practical work, physical drill, foot drill and handling of arms. Instruction comprises all branches of veterinary science, including bacteriology, veterinary work with regard to cattle and dogs, and lactology. 4. Hospitals. —The main veterinary hospital is situ ated in Tehran, and a hospital is to be established at each divisional headquarters. 5. Remount services—At present no organised re mount service exists, and only one remains of the Government stud farms which were established by Nasir-ed-Din Shah. This farm is under the super- yision of a Persian civilian and for some time past has not furnished any horses for the army. A pro- posal has been made by which a remount depot with stud farms shall be established as a branch of the Veterinary Department, but so far no decision has- been come to on this matter.r 75 CHAPTER XX. Auxiliary Units and Semi-Military forces. 1 . General .—The only semi-military forces which .exist in Persia are the Amnieh (road guards) and ttie irregular tribesmen. 2 . Amnieh {road guards ).—This force, recently organised, is used for the protection of the main roads. It was originally formed of men of the old Gendar merie who were considered unfit for the army. Re emits are now taken from men who do not come up to the standard of the regular forces. For purposes of administration the country is divided into five dis tricts corresponding with the divisional areas shown in Chapter VII. The officer commanding each district is attached to the headquarters of Division con cerned, the officer commanding the whole Amnieh be ing stationed in Tehran under the orders of the Minister of the Interior. The duty of the Amnieh is to give warning of the existence of robbers and to identify the perpetratois of any robbery, leaving their pursuit and capture to the military authorities, if immediate capture canno be effected. It is intended to have one guard for every four miles of road, but owing to lack of funds this number has not been reached. 3. Irregular tribes.—The report of the Anglo-Persian Military Commission (1920) gives the total fighting strength of the principal tribes of Persia as 300,000 men, but estimates vary considerably. It is impossible to estimate with any accuracy the number of men which any group of tribes would put into the field, since such varying factors as the dis tance of the individual from his home an ^ inter-tribal jealousies have a bearing on the subject. The Military authorities hope eventually to obtain detachmen s from each of the principal tribes for incorporation in the Army.76 3 . Special body guard- troops. —These are non^ existent. The “ Ahmedi ” infantry regiment of the 1st (Central) Division was always considered to be the special unit for the protection s&gt;f the Sovereign’s person. At the time of the republican movement (March 1924) the name of this unft was changed to ‘‘ Rezapur ”, but it has since been found necessary to restore to it its former duties and style.CHAPTER XXI. Police and Gendarmerie. 1. The Gendarmerie no longer exists in Persia. This force was taken over by the Ministry of War from the Ministry of the Interior in 1921 and finally broken up in January 1922 when its personnel was drafted into the Army, and the Swedish officers dismissed. 2. Police .—The only organised police in Persia exists in Tehran and the provincial capitals. The headquarters of this force is in Tehran. Strengths— Tehran—SO Officers, 1,112 N. C. O.’s and consta bles. This number includes 30 officers, 80 mounted police and 47 detectives. The area in which this force operates is Tehran itself and the country 4 miles round. Meshed.—20 Officers, 324 N. C. O.’s and con stables, including 9 mounted police. Resht.—20 Officers, 300 N. C. O.’s and constables. Kazvin .—15 Officers, 180 N. C. O.’s and con stables. Tabriz—20 Officers, 350 N. C. O.’s and constables. (Under Tabriz for police administration are the towns of Urumieh and Khoi.) Arms and Equipment .—Mounted police are armed with the Lebel carbine and sabre; foot police with batons ; most of them, how T ever, carry private revolvers or pistols in addition. Owing to the scarcity of money for the police admi nistration there is very little equipment in store and no issue has been made for a considerable period.78 Pay and Recruitment.—'Wat pay °f the , p&lt; ?! 1Ce fo ^ e is always considerably in arrears, although the condi tions are not so bad in the provincial towns where the police are paid from local revenues— Constable ••• N. C. O.’s ... ••• 19 * 2 nd-Lieutenant ... ••. 40 Lieutenant ... ••• Commissary ••• ••• Recruitment is voluntary, men enlisting for a three years’ contract. In spite of the fact that pay is generally in arrears, men are generally willing to re-enlist. Schools—A school used to exist at which N. C. O.’s recommended for promotion to officers’ rank under went a three months’ course. This, however, has been suspended since 1922 owing to lack of funds. 1 lam ing of officers is carried out by superior officers. Expansion .—Discussion is at present going on as to the desirability of raising similar police forces in Hamadan and Kerman; as, however, there is a considerable shortage of money for the existing force, it appears unlikely that any expansion will be carried out. 3 . Military —No special corps of Military Police exists. Men for provost and military police duties are drawn from infantry battalions, and dur ing the period of their duty wear a red brassard with the words “ Mamur-i-Tanzimat-i-Nizami ” (Military policemen) inscribed in white.so 3. Pensions of officers and other ranks. General— The pension arrangements of the Persian Army are under the Adjutant General s Department of the General Staff, which keeps all the records and calculates the necessary budget allowances each year. Five per cent, of the pay of all ranks is deducted each year and placed in the Treasury for the Pensions Fund. In the case of officers, this deduction is not made from Command Allowance. All sums deducted from individuals whilst on leave are also placed to the credit of the pensions fund. Pensioners who engage in treasonable offences against the Government or conduct themselves in a manner contrary to military regulations, on proof of the charge, are liable to forfeiture of pension. This refers also to the heirs of such pensioners. If any pensioner is found guilty of a civil crime, his pension is forfeited, but in this case his heirs are given pensions in accordance with the regulations for deceased persons. The grant of a pension is limited to Persian sub jects, and any renunciation of Persian nationality leads to forfeiture of pension. Pensioners who re-enlist are permitted to count their previous service towards pension. War service and periods of service spent in un healthy localities such as Sistan, Baluchistan, Arabistan and the Persian Gulf, count as double in assessing service for pension. If officers on the pension establishment enter any other Government service, the amount of their pen sions is deducted from the pay of their new appoint ment. This rule also holds good in the case of N. C. O.’s and men in receipt of injury pensions. Pensioners are kept on the reserve for five years and may be called up if required.An officer must serve for at least one year in a rank before he becomes eligible to receive the pension of that rank. Periods of service for pension. Rank. Period. N. C. O.s after 21 years’ service. Officers below field rank at 43 years of: age Yawars ... ... 50 iSaib Sarhangs ... 55 „ Sarhangs ... ... 60 „ Sartips ... ..62 ,, Amir Lashkar ... 65 Higher ranks ... 68 „ Officers count from the day of first commission towards pension, including time spent in the military school and on the unemployed list. No period of service counts which is spent under any department other than the military department, unless the appointment is made by the War Ministry. Rate of pension. —Officers who retire at the end of forty years’ service receive, a pension of o’/lOths of their pay (this is calculated only on pay, not on allowances). Officers, who by reason of medical unfitness or any personal reason are unable to complete their service, receive the following pensions: — After 10 years’ service, one-third of their pay of rank. After 15 years’ service, three-eighths of their pay of rank. For every year in excess of 15, one-fiftieth of the pay of rank is added to the pensions admissible at 15 years. 4. Wound pensions. —Officers who h^ve been wounded in the performance of their duty or in saving the life of another person and are incapacitated for any further form of work are given their full rate of pay without reference to their length of service. Officers who have been wounded and are only fitted for light work receive a pension of three-fifths of their82 pay it their length of service is 15 years; for every year over 15 an addition of one-fiftieth of the total rate of pay is made. Officers who have been wounded and leave the army, but are not unfitted for further work, receive a pen sion of two-fifths of their pay of rank if the period of service is 15 years; for every year over 15 an addi tion of one-fiftieth of their pay is made. Officers who in or after the fortieth year of their service are wounded and rendered unfit for further service receive a gratuity of six months’ pay m addi tion to pension. For N. C. O.’s such as Mu’in Naib, Wakil and Sirjouqeh, who are wounded and unfitted to earn a livelihood the full rate of pay is admissible as pen sion. For private soldiers in similar circumstances four and a half tomans a month are admissible. 5 . Family pensions .—The pensions for the heirs of •officers l^iUed in action is four-fifths of the pay of rank, irrespective of length of service. In the case of officers, who die in the course of military service after having served for 10 years, four-fifths of the pension, to which they would have been entitled had they survived, is given to the heirs as family pension. In the case of an officer who dies in the course of military service before completing 10 years’ service, pay of rank for one year and a half is given to his heirs in the following instalments: — Six months’ pay in one instalment and the balance in monthly payments. On the death of an officer in receipt of pension, three-fifths of his pension is given to his heirs. The legal heirs of deceased officers are: — Male and female children, grandsons, wife, father, mother, sisters, and brothers dependent on the deceased for support. For distribution of pen sion, all heirs receive an equal share.Male children receive pensions up to the age of 21 and female children and wife until marriage. At the death of any person in receipt of a family pension, payment of this share of the pension ceases. No family pension may be confiscated in payment of any debt. 6 . Issue of yay and pension. —Pay is drawn from the divisional headquarters pay authorities by the officer commanding the regiment, and issued to men by being passed down through battalion, company and platoon commanders* As all of these may attempt to make something out of it for themselves, the full amount of pay seldom reaches the man for whom it is drawn. Pensioners draw their pensions from the officer com manding at the nearest town where there are troops, who draws money for pensioners from the divisional headquarters. Pensions are generally paid every six months in arrears. 7. Efficiency pay and prize money.—K&amp; far as is known no system of efficiency pay exists in the Persian army. 8 . Allowances.—Command allowance is only given to an officer where actually employed, not when on leave or on the unemployed list. Rank. Command allowance. Krans per month. Naib Sewum (3rd Lieut.)

Os. and men travelling alone are given an allowance of one Kran for each farsakh. The above allowances are not admissible to indi viduals on transfer from one district to another. In these cases, only the expenses of the journey are paid.Forage Allowance. —The following officers are ■entitled to draw free rations for the number of horses .as shown below;:— Rank. No. of horses.

Senior Medical Officer of an Infantry, Cavalry or Artillery Brigade ranking as Yawar. Officer Commanding the Military Hospital at Tehran ranking as Yawar. No other medical officers are entitled to free horse rations, but may be given them when on the march.86 1 CHAPTER XXIII. i Discipline. 1 . Military penal code and military law. (a) General note.—&amp; Persian Manual of Military Law was introduced towards the end of 1923. The book is divided into three main parts: ( 1 ) Formation of Courts Martial. ( 2 ) Elements of Military Courts, containing details about courts martial. ( 3 ) The Law of Military punishments. The chief point noticeable about Persian Military law is the fact that comparatively severe sentences of imprisonment can be awarded to officers. Persons subject to Military law — (a) All officers and men of the land, sea and air forces of Persia. (A) Unemployed persons and reservists if the offence has reference to military service. (c) Officers and men employed outside the army if the offence has reference to military service. (d) Civilians employed by the army if the offence relates to military service. Should a person subject to Military law commit a . crime the punishment for which is laid down in civil, but not in Military law, he may be punished in accordance with the civil law. Persons offending against civil law are punished in accordance with that law, but the punishment is carried out in military custody. Within the confines of Persia, the Military Tribunal can try foreigners for offences punishable under mili tary law and Persian subjects for offences against the Army. In enemy country all persons can be tried for offences with reference to the Army.divided 2 . Courts Martial. —Courts martial are into— (a) Common. (&amp;) Special. (а) is a divisional court which sits permanently at Divisional H. Q., or may be convened temporarily elsewhere. It is composed of 5 to 7 members who are changed every six months. ( б ) is composed of members of the Military Tribu nal specially convened. Each division has a “ court martial department ” composed of religious judges, interrogators and clerks. A Judge Advocate General s Department similarly composed, the members of which are chosen by the Commander-in-Chief, exists at Army Head quarters. The Military Tribunal is convened in war time or in any district under military law' by the Mimstei o War or competent authority. Its findings are pro mulgated at once and must be put into effect within 24 hours. It is composed of 5—7 members. A Special Court of Appeal composed of 6 members is specially convened for investigating appeals. Members of Courts Martial must be Persian sub jects, Mussulmans, of good character, have never been convicted by a court martial, be members of the Persian Army and over the age of 25 (in the case of the president of the court over 30 years of age.) Should any member of the court be related to or have previous friendship or enmity with the accused, he must resign his place on the court. No officer can sit on a court martial when the accused is a man belonging to his own unit. 3. Court Martial proceedings. —Upon a person being accused, interrogation is carried out under the super vision of the Judge Advocate by the interrogator who is an officer of the Judge Advocate’s Department.The interrogations must be secret and must be com menced within 24 hours after the commission to prison of the accused. The interrogating officer records his opinion as to the necessity or otherwise for court martial and for wards a report to the Divisional Commander who issues necessary orders for further procedure. The accused must be informed of his crime three days before the commencement of the court martial. He is to be given the opportunity of appointing an -advocate and, should he be unable to do so, an officer will be detailed as prisoner’s friend. The accused, or prisoner’s friend, previous to the •court martial must ask in writing for : — (a) witnesses to be called in his defence. (b) further interrogation. At the commencement of proceedings, five members of the court martial must be present and seven when the voting takes place. The Judge Advocate is not held to be a member of the Court,' nor is he to be present when the court considers the finding. All courts martial, unless specially otherwise ordered, are open. Should the accused object to a member of the court and the objection be upheld, the court martial will be postponed and another member required from the Ministry of War or the Divisional Commander. Should the accused create a disturbance in court, he may be turned out at the discretion of the president and the proceedings continued in the presence of the prisoner’s friend. 4. Sentences .—If the accused is sentenced to im prisonment, any period spent in confinement before the sentence is passed is reckoned towards his sentence. Appeal must be forwarded within five days after the promulgation of the sentence, an extra day being •allowed for each five farsakhs (20 miles) distant from a Judge Advocate’s office.JL 89 ■substituted. Corporal punishment requires the confirmation of the Judge Advocate General’s Department at Army Headquarters. Punishments are of three kinds: n\ TTnnrln.mfirvhfl.l— r.a.. Imprisonment. 5. Punishments. — Imprisonment, if for less than one •vear, is carried out in a civil prison; if for moie, in a special military prison. Imprisonment for more than 30 days does not count as service towards pension and for more than 3 months debars from rise in pay. Junior officers and N. C. Os. sentenced to more than one year’s imprisonment are reduced to the ranks and debarred from all further promotion. Ordinary imprisonment is divided into solitary and collective. Rigorous imprisonment .—Solitary with special diet and confiscation of pay. For officers, carried out in a special room; for N. C. Os. and men in a special part of the prison. Penal servitude .—Awardable to H. C. Os. and men for from one to five years and carried out in a gar rison battalion. Flogging .—Only awardable to N. C. Os. and men, to be administered at evening inspections. The whip to be of leather, plain and 45 inches long. The hand90 is not to be lifted above or behind the head when administering the lash. Under the orders of the medical officer, one day’s imprisonment may be substi tuted for each lash awarded. Pecuniary punishments. —Only awardable to senior officers. In the case of junior officers and men, im prisonment is substituted at the rate of one day per toman, the total not to exceed one year. Death. —Soldiers who are guilty of a civil crime punishable by death are to be dismissed from the Army and handed over to the Civil authorities. Death sentences for Military offences, are to be carried out by shooting in front of the battalion to which the condemned belongs or a representative detachment. Firing party to be composed of 12 . Sentence not to be carried out on a religious feast day. Imprisonment with hard labour. —Sentence, if not for life, must be between 5 and 10 years and includes reduction to the ranks and deprivation of civil rights. Imprisonment in a fortress comprises deprivation of military rank, civil rights and possession of private property. Sentence, if not for life, to be between 3 and 10 years. Persons sentenced to any of the above grades of im prisonment may, on release, be forbidden to reside in a certain locality for a given time. Exile to be for a period between 3 and 15 years and includes deprivation of military rank and civil rights. Should any person sentenced to exile or any of the above grades of imprisonment escape and be re captured, a term of imprisonment of the next more severe grade is awarded, except in the case of hard labour, when half the sentence is added. Reduction to the ranks and dismissal to be carried out in public in front of the battalion to which the condemned person belongs.JL 91 Prevention from sharing in private property may- fee awarded separately or in addition to other punish ments. It includes deprivation of military rank and •civil rights and of right to hold Government appoint ments. 6. Pardon, suspension and remission of sentences .— Pardon. —Offences committed by mad persons or those under 13 years of age are pardoned. Offences com mitted by those between 13 and 14 years are punish able by one-third of the normal punishment. When an offence is committed at the instigation of •another person, the agent is pardoned and the insti gator punished. Suspension. —If a first offence should be a minor one, the court may recommend suspension of punishment for three years: should no further offence be com mitted, the punishment may be remitted, but any compensation payable will not be pardoned. Reductions.- —In cases where the commission of the •crime has been caused by circumstances outside the •control of the condemned, sentences may be reduced -to the one next lower in the scale. If a crime has been commenced, but not completed •owing to outside circumstances, the punishment award- able shall be the least for that particular crime. Pardoning of crimes and restoration of rights .— Only those offences can be pardoned which the law holds to be pardonable. Pardons can only be given by the decree of the Shah and in accordance with the law. A pardon may be absolute or partial (the latter is almost equivalent to reduction of sentence). Restoration of rights is dependent on the good behaviour of the condemned and can only be granted after the lapse of 3 years from the commencement of the sentence. 7. Collective crimes.—M\ those sharing in the com mission of a crime are held to be equally guilty.92 Those instigating or willingly assisting the com mission of a crime are held to be accessories. Their punishment will be the one next lower than the punishment for the given crime. 8 . Leave and furlough- —Leave for periods not ex ceeding 48 hours is granted to N. C. O. s and men by the officer commanding the company. Leave tor periods up to one week may be granted by the officer commanding the battalion, and for periods in excess by the officer commanding the regiment. Officers’ leave is granted by the officer commanding the regiment, leave of over one month requiring the sanction of the divisional staff. 9 . Morale. —Officers and men of the present Persian army fall into three categories: {a) of the old Cossack division. ( 6 ) of the old Swedish-trained gendarmerie. (c) individuals who have joined since the forma tion of the new Persian army. As classes (a) and (&amp;) are frequently hostile to one another the attainment of good morale has been hampered, but a growing pride in belonging to the Persian army is noticeable in all ranks.CHAPTER XXIV. Ordnance Department. 1. The Mubashirat (Ordnance) Department of the Persian Army has not as yet been properly organised. Each division, brigade and regiment has an officer of this department attached to it, who is res ponsible, in conjunction with the officer commanding the formation, for the purchase and manufacture of clothing and for the purchase of rations. 2. Government arsenal .—This institution is at present in progress of re-organisation. A number of mechanics and machinery has been obtained from Germany, and a new building is to be erected on the Jajarud river £h the vicinity of Tehran. The chief controller of this arsenal is to be Col. Hartmann, a German Officer now in Tehran. The manufacture of guns and rifles is not to be undertaken at this arsenal, which will limit itself to the repair of arms existing in the Persian army, all replacements being obtained from foreign countries. It is intended to manufacture a limited quantity of ammunition and explosives.94 CHAPTER XXV. Aeronautics. 1 The air arm of the Persian army is still in its infancy. All the pilots and technical personnel are foreign (4 Russian, 3 French and 4 German); ten Persian officers were sent to Moscow in the autumn of 1924 to undergo instruction as pilots, and it was intended to open a school for pilots in Tehran under the direction of the French senior pilot M. Berhault; lack of money has, however, postponed the opening of ihis school. 2 . As is natural there is considerable jealousy between the pilots of the various Rationalities, and as a result there is little attempt at organisation. 3 . A variety of types of machine are in the Persian .air force: — 3 Avio. j^ ugg j an machines. 2 D. H. 9. j 2 Junker passenger machines. 2 Junker two-seater machines. 2 Breguets (Observation type XIV A 2 ). 2 Spad (Ecole type 42). 2 Potez (Ecole type VIII). ]$ 0 te .—Above information is dated July 1925. 4 All machines are at present located in Tehran; machines are sent from there as required to take part in any operations. 5 . Aerodromes with hangars are located at Tehran? Bushire, Bandar Abbas*, and Duzdap; without hangars at Tabriz, Enzeli, Qum, Meshed, Shahrud, Burujird, Khurramabad, Isfahan, Bandar Dilam, Shiraz, Ahwaz, Birjand, and Charbar* The landing grounds prepared in 1923 at Kermanshah, Hamadan and Kazvin for the flight of two British machines fromz: Baghdad to Tehran have been allowed to become over grown with vegetation. (JV ate .—Of the above landing grounds these marked * are still under British super vision. The hanga'rs at Bushire are still under British care). Landing grounds at Tabriz, Isfahan and Shiraz, are bad, and improperly prepared. 6. All supplies and spares for machines arc obtained frctm abroad. 7. Civil aviation is non-existent. The Junker com pany has recently received a concession for an air- route Tehran—Tabriz—Tiflis and thence to Berlin. It will probably be some time before this service materia lises.96 CHAPTER XXVI. Military Education. J\Q?r er ^~ The . m i litary schools were ie-organized in 1923 and consist of : — (a) The Military College under the General fetaff. (b) The Non-Commissioned Officers School under the command of the General Officer Com manding, Tehran Infantry Brigade. into - 4 5 6 7 * * * — ^ Schools.

Training and tacUcs.-Both of these are in an i xti emely backward state. Owing to the lack of efficient and up to date text books officers have nothing HnJ 111 ^ l them i/-n the trainin S of their men. The p . r . ei n . ow ln use shows considerable Russian influence owing to the facts that a number of officers of the Persian army have received their train ing in Russia, and to the existence in the army of Officers .—Seethe officers of the Russian-trained 'Cossack Division”- P or the same reasons the few text books existing show a Russian influence; in most cases, however, these text books would be useless to a modern European trained army, as their authors appear to lack experience, and not to have assimilated properly the principles laid down by their teachers. An im provement may be expected on the return to Persia of the officers now being trained in France.98 CHAPTER XXVII. Uniform.
