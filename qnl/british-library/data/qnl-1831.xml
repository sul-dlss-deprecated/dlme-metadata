My Lords consider that the operations undertaken by the Commander-in-Chief were well calculated to produce the maximum effect at a minimum cost, and that if he had confined his operations strictly to the neighbourhood of the coast the cost of the expedition would have been to a great extent wasted.

With reference to your letter of the 17th instant enclosing copies of telegrams exchanged with the Government of India regarding the recent military operations on the Persian coast for the suppression of the arms traffic, I an directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to state that he concurs in the terms of the telegram which Viscount Morley proposes to address to the Government of India in reply to the Viceroy’s telegram of the 9th instant. I am Sir Your most obedient humble Servant Under Secretary of State India Office.From Viceroy, 9th May 1911. Foreign Secret. Mekran arms traffic. Admiral offers following ex^ planation:— “ Barkat Khan is the head and front of arms traffic in Persian Baluchistan. It is he who invited Afghans to come down this year, and it was reported that he was boasting that they were coming from Fanoch in large numbers to assist him. His sole object in raiding loyal villages is to force them to give him and the^Afghans active assistance, as without this assistance of coast villages it is impossible to make certain of getting a cargo away even when it has reached the coast. Mir of Kambar and Mir of Haji, who were placed in charge of Biyaban coast at our suggestion, and who have been loyally abstaining from helping arms runners, complained that Barkat had looted on a large scale lately amongst their followers, and had killed some of their men. Representatives of villages looted also came into Jask to report that Barkat had used violence, and told them that the friends of Sircar would be looted, while those who followed Barkat would not be molested. It was known that Afghans were with Barkat during these raids and many more were said to have joined him afterwards. “ The Governor of the coast ports admitted to Political Resident 1n Persian Gulf recently in connection with these operations that he had no force or means to act against Barkat. It is, in fact, notorious that the Persian Government are powerless in these regions, and if action had not been taken by ns we could no longer have counted on assistance of any of the coast peoples in regard to suppression of arms traffic, and the situation in the Biyaban district would have become exceedingly difficult. Probably Barkat would have said that he had driven us off, and his prestige with the Afghans would have increased enormously. I he Biyaban is the easiest coast on which to run arms during the south west monsoon. It is almost impossible to do so on the Mekran coast during that season except on rare occasions : the Biyaban coast is also the most difficult to guard, as it is only 30 miles from Oman coast, and dhows can easily slip across and land arms if they are certain of a friendly reception on the other side.^ It is therefore of the utmost importance, as stated in my telegram of the 27th February, No. 16, to maintain active co-operation with coast villages and Mirs, unless we are prepared to continue blockade on a costly scale for an indefinite period. If Barkat’s power over them is broken, then it will lie possible shortl} 7 to make a considerable reduction in expenses. “ Under these circumstances I considered it advisable to order movements in question, as they have a greater bearing on the issue of operations for the suppression of traffic in arms than the capture of a cargo of arms and ammunition. “ r i he troops were already under orders to re-embark when I received Government of India s telegram under reply. The ostensible reason for the expedition, however, was to recapture a cargo of arms wrecked on the Biyaban coast about a fortnight previously from a Koweit dhow, some of which had been taken b\ the natives. Of these about half have been recovered by expeditionary force.” y Admiral’s telegram 16 was forwarded with Foreign Secretary’s letter No 9 M, dated 2nd March. . 1 trust &gt; in the circumstances of case, the Admiral’s action may not be judged from a too strict interpretation of his instructions.In reply quote M Confidential. / am commanded by My Lords Commissioners The Under Secret ary of State, G &amp; S 2409 [ 3122 ] 500 5/08v [SEE OVER7X2_ /»•/&gt; ''J &lt;? fl'Yi'ii nrv\ a c*4 Departments are requested, if they suspect that there'is any mistake in this telegram, to communicate immediately with the Private Secretary to the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State. /pi COPY OF TELEGRAM.

I informed Minister for Foreign Affairs verbally, 15tb April, in the sense of your telegram No. 4, Africa. I think it best to make no communication to Persian Government until they object, which I think that they are quite likely to do. A question has been asked in Parliament here relative to rumoured intention of His Majesty’s Government to land troops in Mekran. Minister for Foreign Affairs replied that no troops had been landed. It may be less embarrassing for him to remain in ignorance as long as possible. I have little doubt that the Persian Government will object if they get to hear of I the agreements with Sardars of Geh-Bint. It would be well that these should be as informal as possible. | 463—140 | -I In reply quote M Couiideutial. 0&gt; Admiralty, I r- JULcuy- ]f, U ■ % u Y lb I i / am commanded by My Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to transmit for the information of the Secretary of State for of a telegram dated &gt;3^ ]S[o. c) from f) D \ t. f tt-P &amp; jbU ^ ^ ^ Q I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, The Under Secretary of State, 3 n^cAjU*, Office.

AYhole district of Biyi.ban is being raided by Barkat Khan, who has a following of about 400 to 500 men, partly Baluchis and partly of Bashakard tribe, and also a few Afghans, and property of the villages under friendly Mirs is being destroyed and carried off by him. Barkat expects more Afghans to join him. On 25th April troops disembarked at Sirik. They will operate in two columns, one to south and other to north, visiting those villages which are assisting Barkat, and will, where necessary, inflict punishment. Barkat is endeavouring to make this district centre for importation of arms, and steps which are being taken will, it is hoped, destroy his influence there, and prevent district from becoming centre again. About 5th May troops will be embarked again, and after that date it is proposed to send them to Bombay if there is no further development.In reply quote M Copy has also boon sent Confidential.

With reference to the correspondence ending with your letter No. 3105, dated 2(Jth November 1910, regarding the licensing of dhows at Maskat to fly the French flag, I have the honour to inform you that the French Consul has unofficially informed me that he has registered another dhow the “ Musaffa ” (or “ MoQaffa ” according to French Consul’s present spelling) in the name of the firm of Goguyer, and that the craft is authorized to sail under the French flag. 2. The “ Musaffa ” is, I understand, the dhow which was detained by nde Mr. Holland’* letter No. 135 , dated the aoth H. M. S. “ Hyacinth ” on the 27th January January i»io. 1910, about which there was so much correspondence. The craft was hauled up on the beach at the French coaling depot and remained there, as stated in my letter No. 1618, dated 11th December 1910, until Monsieur Neauber arrived, when it was reported that he had arranged to sell the dhow to Sol Muhammad, the notorious gun-running Nakhoda, and others for $300, and that Sol Muhammad was going to repair the dhow and use her for gun-running. It appears now, however, that some other arrangement has been come to; the dhow lias been repaired and I understand that Sol Muhammad is to be the Nakhoda of the craft for MM. Goguyer, but the latter remain owners of the craft at least nominally. 3. It may be convenient if I add that the firm of Goguyer now has three dhows, vie.: — (1) “ Fath-el-Khair”—boom—wdiich recently made an unsuccessful trip to Katr, &amp;c., with arms, Nakhoda Ismail Ishak. (2) “ Semhanboom—a smaller craft which was originally only licensed on the firm giving an undertaking not to ship arms in her pend ing orders of the French Government.
