The map is a cross-section of the depth of the coastal water, in the vicinity of the Sheikh of Kuwait’s coal shed, the position of which is marked. A horizontal line with a marker at intervals along its length, represents actual spots where soundings or heights were taken by HMS
                           Lapwing.
