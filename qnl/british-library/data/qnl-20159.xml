I found that the legal advisers of the ^eraskeirate and tue /orte q —. ijpii — stron ;ly lo uhe legality of the coneeiTination on the ground that the court-martial was incom petent to try civilians in the absence of a declaration of a state of sp^Jge, and that culprits condefined by default could only be executed after retrial. v I pointed out to the Grand Visier that the culprits condemnec by default had already been rotfijtfed, and with regard to the alleged illegality of the trial by court-martial, I declared myself utterly unable to understand how the rorte or the Geraskeirate could stultify a decision promulgated by Imperial Irade 7 . The procedure followed had been ordered by the Sultan, and to reverse it now would be to lower the dignity of His Imperial Majesty, as well as dangerous to public order in Bussorah, where, as the Grand Vizier knew, the condition of the country was already critical.

It does not appear that the rurk nas avei | 1 established any effective occupation *onere and to elicit this fact alone has ampi^ repaid uhe Po 1 i ti c al Apent fo r hi s 1 oumey. The people of Anta' a maintained, v/itrio 1 it lec^-.i— ing questions, that their relations vdth Koweit were of the most frien il^ and binding nature and that they considered the Sheikh of Koweit as tneir suzerain rather than the Amirs of 3iadh or the Turk at SJl Ahsa.This attitude, it would seem useful to encourage and support, as, wii.h the general gro\/th 0 f prosperity and population along the Arab coast of the Persian Gulf, Anx^a 1 a is (i;iite li-o-elj bo velop in-oo greater import-ance than at present and as a convenient half way house for iiadh, it v/ould seem important to prevent a Tuncish adv.-uice in that iirect^ion. c &gt;heikh I ,r ob ^rai-i looks iroon Anta a as within the Kov/eit boundaries and the fact of-one | welcome received by the Political A^'.cent an'l uiie 1 possibility of his travelling the 150 miles to that point without the slightest molestation o: | any kind,lends support to that view and enables one to foim an estimate of t.he hold mat the I Koweit Sheikh has obtained over the surrounding I oountry.lt would be a comparatively simple matter I to induce the Sheikhs of Ant a'a to a-tait their I subordination to Koweit in writing, tai-ie them uu | protection anl use trie village as a diplomatic ov'.u-| work,protecting Koweit from the south.It would oe00148 useful to examine the route from -ohe coast though 3* start should b© laade .c'poiii /\nta * a itself to avoi i Turkish observation* These su|i^Qscions are put zorth tentaijivq I ^ i/i uri the full oonsoiousness that there is anotner si te to t-he question and that anj undue ac^ivit^ mi^u^-t induce a forward Turkish laoveiaent virhich raight otherwise never have 'been contemplatea. It is interesting to note that on the night ox 'ohe 18th yebrnar^' the crater skins belonging to tae Political Agent's escort v/ere frozen hard, so that 3.

A quantity of water not less than half a gallon should be sent for analysis : for a detailed mineral analysis a gallon ought to be provided. 2. The water should be collected in glass stoppered bottles ; corks are objectionable, but if used they must be quite new and be well washed with water, 3. Extreme care should be exercised in securing the cleanliness of the bottles used ; after cleansing they should be well rinsed three times with the water requiring analysis, then filled to within half an inch of the stopper, and sealed : no luting with linseed meal or such substances is permissible. Samples should be kept, if possible, in a cool dark place. 4. In taking water from a pump, allow four gallons to flow before collecting the sample ; from a tap two gallons should be allowed to flow ; and in each case let the water pass direct from the spout into the bottle. 5. Water intended to represent the water supply of a town must be taken from a pipe in direct communication ^Ith a street main, and not from a cistern. 6. In taking samples from a tank, well, or stream, where practicable, bottles should be completely immersed beneath the surface before filling : if a vessel bo used to draw up the water, it must be scrupulously clean, and the collection of the surface water must be avoided as much as possible. On the other hand, care must be taken to avoid the disturbance of mud or sediment at the bottom of the water. 7. Samples should be carefully labelled so as to show the source and date of collection. 8. The following information should be furnished :— (a). The source, whether from well, river, stream or tank. {l&gt;). Description of the soil, subsoil, and water bearing stratum in which well is sunk. (c). Diameter and depth of well, and bow it is lined or steined. {d). Distance of well from cesspools and drains. If from a stream—- (d). Distance from the source to point of collection.

The El 'Odah were defeated, with some loss. The Mutessarif applied to the vilayet for more troops to reduce the tribes to order. The Administrative Council here came to the conclusion a month ago that it was not feasible to send more troops to Hassa for the purpose, and passed a Resolution to the effect that Bin Saoud should be invited to settle the tribal differences in Hassa in the Arab way. The Vali communicated this Resolution to the Minister of the Interior, the Reform Commissioner, and the Mutessarif of Hassa, and wrote at the same time to Bin Saoud, asking him to go to Hassa for the purpose.

Grey, copy of correspondence witJr^the Crovernment of India on the sub ject, including the report of the Political Agent at Koweit regarding his visit to the village of Anta^, which lias occasion ed the complaint of the Turkish Govemnent. The Political Agent, it will be observed, states that the people of Antaa 'consider trie Sheikn or Koweit as their suzerain rather than the Amirs of Riadh or the Turk at El Hasa' , while Sheikh Mubarak on ms side 'looks upon Antaa as within the Koweit boundaries'. Major Cox describes the village as 'not in Vilayet or Busran, but territory of tne Ajman tribe under Koweit'. This view is confirmed by what is said on page 9 of the Political Agent's report as to the nature or the Turkish visits to the place in the past. ThereThere is tnus ground on wmcn to contest the right of the Turkish (government to complain of the Political Agent's action. 3ut no useful purpose would, apparently be served by raising the question of the political status of the village, and tne result might be that the Turks would take steps overtly to assert their authority there. It seems to Lord Morley that it might suffice, without directly raising the point whether Antaa is or is not Turkish, to inform the Turkish Ambassador that the facts detail ed m his note have been found on enquiry to be in accurately reported. The journey was not made by five Britisn officers sent to Koweit for the purpose on a ship of war, but was an ordinary tour undertaken by Major Knox and his wife, who sceXagrK v / distributed no arms to the inhabitants and who did not stay with the Sheikh named.

The last reference to this subject is my letter No. 485, dated fHe 17th May 1909. Confidential Memorandum No. 20. 1. Nejd Affairs. —I have received a visit from Jarulla Dakhil, who is con nected with the family of Ibn Rashid, and is also the unofficial representative of Abdul Aziz bin Sa'ud at Baghdad. He said that the Dahamisha Arabs, a power ful section of the Aneyza inhabiting the country in the direction of Kerbela and Nejef, and the Ruwella, another powerful section of the same tribe living towards Damascus, had been at feud with each other for years. He said that Abdul Aziz had written to these two sections begging them to settle their quarrel and put an end to internecine strife among the Arabs. The messenger sent by Abdul Aziz is known as- El Azuma. He is said to have taken back letters from the Sheikhs of the Dahamisha and the Ruwella saying that they have taken the advice offered, and also intimating that they are ready to recognise the position of Abdul Aziz as the Chief Representative of the Arabs. Jarulla also said that the Sheikhs of the Dalaim Arabs were in communication with Abdul Aziz through El Azuma. If the first part of the story is true (and I have no reason to doubt it) the latter part is also probably true, for the Dalaim have long been on bad terms with the Aneyza, and if they'see the-various sections of this tribe combining under one head, they are bound to take steps to strengthen their own position. Jarulla also said that El Azuma had taken letters from the people of Jauf informing Abdul Aziz that the people of that oasis were willing to recognise hita as their chief. Jarulla said that the Sheikhs of Jebel Asair had been in commu nication with Abdul Aziz, but he did not know what had been said. He added that as far as he knew no advances had been made to the Muntefik Arabs or to the Beni Lam, but he said that this might have been 5one through Basra without Ms knowledge. Abdul Aziz had thought of approaching the Sultan with a suggestion that he should fly the Turkish flag, pay a certain amount of tribute to the Turkish Gov ernment, and be recognised as the Governor of the whole of Arabia. He sent a man named Masand bin Suwaila as far as Basra, on his way to Constantinople, with instructions to ascertain how such a proposal was likely to be received, but before the man could get beyond Basra the events of the 13th April occurred, and Masaud, at the advice of Yusuf Pasha, Mandil, of Basra, returned to Nejd. Abdul Aziz is said to have very high ambitions, which would not be satisfied by his appointment as Governor of Arabia under the Turkish Government. What he and a great number of Arabs are aiming at is Arab independence. His great difficulty is that he lacks the cash which is required to organise and start a combined movement. - Jarulla said that Izzat Pasha sent his son to Egypt with about £40,000, a portion of which was to be spent in buying land, and the balance in organising a press campaign in favour of Arab independence. The chief organ to be em ployed was El Muyad. He argued that Izzat Pasha was a very rich man, that he hated the present Turkish Government, that he was working for the in dependence of Syria, and that consequently he might be induced to finance a movement for the independence of Nejd, as it would suit his own purposes todo so. He asked me what I thought of the proposal. I replied that I could not claim to be an expert in Arab politics, but two things appeared to me to be quite clear: (1) that Izzat Pasba was one of the most successful robbers of the age, and (2) that until things at Constantinople settled down it would be difficult for Abdul Aziz or anyone else to know with whom he was dealing. In these circum stances any active policy might lead to results whiph had not been foreseen. Jarulla said that it is not the intention of the Arabs to take part in any fighting which may occur between opposing parties in Turkey ; they will try to organise a combination among themselves. What they would like is Arab independence, but if they cannot get this they would prefer the supremacy of a Foreign Power to that of the Turks. He said that it was perfectly obvious who that Foreign Power would be, and it would not be unpopular as it respects the religion of all its subjects. He ended up by saying that he was at all times at my service, if he could be of any use. 2. Baghdad. —There is again a leeling of unrest abroad. The Reactionary Club known as the Mashwav, which was thought to have ceased to exist, again met on the 15th June. It is said that it met to consider a proposal made in the Tanin that a Court.Martial should sit on the [reactionaries of Baghdad, Basra and Mosul. The Russian Consul-General, who has a large number of Muhammadan acquaintances, tells me that he does not think 10 per cent, of the Muhammadans are satisfied with the present state of affairs. He says that as long as Abdul Hamid remained as Sultan they were inclined to remain tolerant, but that now they think the Muhammadan supremacy is really in danger. Mr. Cree&gt; who has a considerable connection with Baghdad society, tells me that he is inclined to agree with Mr. Maschkow. He says that the Jews have got nearly all the trade in their hands, having gone far towards ousting the Muhammadan merchants. The Jews have also left their old quarter of the town and are getting possession of all the best houses, and raising the rental of others, consequently there are a great many people who would not themselves take any part in riots or massacres, yet who would not care to use their influence to save those who are daily eating them out. The Muhammadans may dislike and despise the Jews, but the Jews loathe and hate the Muhammadans. The older ones have the sense to be civil in public but the youths are apt to be more indiscreet. A few days ago my Head Clerk heard some Jewish boys pouring abuse on the Muhammadans, not for any reason .but just out of light heartedness. I have no reason to doubt his word and what he heard was ample to start a serious disturbance if it had been overheard by any one interested in creating a riot. The French Consul has been rather posing as the Protector of the Christians, but I think he would be much wiser if he told them that he was in no position to protect them, which is the truth, and advised them to be very careful in their behaviour. I thought of speaking to the Rabbi of the conduct of the Jewish boys men tioned above, but I thought it better not to do so, as I did not want to be cited as a witness to the provocative conduct of the Jews. Mr. Gaskin seems to think that there are emissaries from Constantinople at Baghdad for the purpose of stirring up trouble, but he can get no accurate information on the subject. 3. Sir William Willcochs. —The Minister of Public Works forced an '' Adjoint on Sir William Willcocks. Some two months ago Sir William asked him to make a drawing which he (Sir William) said looked as if a child had made it. The Adjoint then said that he was too ill to come to office and he has not been there since. Sir William now learns that he has been well enough to go to Samarra, for which he has got paid £T. 12^ by the Velayet. The local newspapers have begun to ask what this man is doing to earn his pay. I understand that the Accounts Depart ment are giving Sir William a lot of trouble. The Arabs have not yet learned that Englishmen do not take hakshish. One Sheikh offered a gold watch and chain to Sir William Willcocks on the ground that he could not bear to think that he had been robbed by the Arabs of these articles. Another Sheikh asked Sir William to lend him £T. 6 on the security of his mare, probably worth more than £T. 150. Of course he would never have redeemed the mare, and as he is a rich man he could not possibly have been in need of so small a sum. G. M. Press, Simla,—No, 453 F, D,—8-7-09.—16.—M.

Lowther to Foreign Office, No. 609. T heeapia ; July 29th i 1909. Sir, With reference to my despatches Nos. 390 and 435 of April 21st and June 11th last respectively on the subject of the affairs of the Nejd, I have the honour to forward to you further despatches as marked in the margin dealing with this intricate question. You will perceive that since the murder of Saud Ihn Rashid and the subs titution for him as ruler of the boy Abdul Aziz, under the regency of Zamil Ibn Sebhan (see page 47 of the yearly report) fortune has favoured the north ern family, and Ibn Saud is, in the opinion of His Majesty's Consul at Damascus, even in danger of becoming perhaps merely notable as the hereditary Emir of the Wahabis, while His Majesty's Consul at Jeddah represents this sect itself as moriband. Its particular tenets, however, seem only to differ from those of the Senoussi in respect of the Liturgy (Wirds) which they use, the aim to return to the purity of the faith in its primitive days being common to both. You will observe that Ibn Rashid is the leader to whom the Turks give their support, paying him £ 150 a month. On the other hand Ibn Saud relies considerably upon the Sheikh of Koweit (who apparently finds him useful as a counterbalance in his part of the world to the power of Ibn Keshid) and as the Sheikh of Koweit is considered to be a protege of His Majesty's Government, so there is a kind of idea that Ibn Saud also enjoys their countenance. The translation of the pamphlet enclosed by Mr. Monahan in his despatch No. 23 is interesting, as, though written by a strong partisan of Ibn Eeshid, it gives a considerable amount of information from that point of view. I have, etc., (Sd.) GERALD LOWTHER. Copy. Mis Britannic Majesty s Consul, Jeddah, to Sir G. Lowther. Jeddah, No. 23. May 15th, 1909. Sir, With reference to my despatch No. 17 of the 9th ultimo and to Acting-Con sul Dr. S. M. Husain's despatch No. 4 of February 7th, 1907, I have the honour to transmit herewith an abridged translation of a manuscript pamphlet lately sent to Dr. S. M. Busain by its author Suleiman Bassam, a prominent merchant residing in Mecca, a native of Aneyza in Nejd, a strong partisan of Ibn Rashid and opponent of the Wahhabi party or party of Ibn Saud. The author assumes that his readers already know the general course of recent events in Nejd, and therefore his statements are incomplete and his chronology somewhat vague.The following, as I understand from local Jeddah informants, has been the course of events :— Abdul Aziz ibn Mutab ibn Rashid was killed in battle against Ibn Saud in 1324 (1906), and was succeeded by his son Metab ibn Abdul Aziz, aged 18, who reigned 9 months and was then killed in January 1907 by his maternal uncle Sultan, as reported by Dr. M. Husain in the despatch above referred to. Sultan reigned till A-pril 1908 when he was killed by his brother Saud who, in August 1908, was overthrown and shortly afterwards killed, his (Saud s) place as Amir being taken by Saud ibn Abdul Aziz the ^ present Amir aged about 10, brother of the previous Amir Mutab ibn Aziz—not by the same mother, as Dr. M. Husain erroneously states, but by a lady of the Subhan family members of which family are now his guardians. I have, etc., (Sd.) J. H. M ON AH AN, Eis Britannic Majesty's Consul, Translation, In the year 1205 Hijri (1792) arose the Amirate of Saud under a show of religious policy, but really serving worldly ends. Now Sheikh Mohammed ibn Abdul Wahhab, the famous founder of the Wahhabi sect, was working with Saud ibn Abdul Aziz the first Amir of the Saud line, and he first gave out fetwas enioining obedience to Saud and he named him Imam of the Moslems and said that he who rose against him had no religion, and he who opposed him was an infidel. For twenty years the apostles of this faith spread it by the sword until finally Mecca and Medina were taken, and the Syrian Haj Caravan was driven back in accordance with a Eetwa from Abdul Wahhab. Now the mother of the Sultan of the Osmanlis was in this caravan, and the Sultan was angry and the Egyptian expeditions ordered by the Sultan followed by which Arabia was conquered, but no soldiers nor Government authorities were imposed on Nejd, which land was loft in its Arab Bedowy state and 22 years later the Saud family began to raise its previous pretentions, Imam Faisul Saud bringing men to the religion by the power of the sword and denouncing as infidels all who opposed him. The Government took alarm and Khurshed Pasha was sent from Egypt in 1253 (1837) and Eaisul was taken prisoner, and afterwards there was confusion and discord in the family and destruction fell on it ; and meanwhile the Amirate of the house of Ibn Rashid was independent and the house of Saud had no authorry over it, but rather paid it respect and courted it, and offered it yearly presents out of the Nejd revenues, and so the relations between the two houses were friendly m the time of Eaisul and the frontier was in (?) Kasim, and the North was under the sway of the house of JReshid and the South under the sway of the house of Saud, and in 1290 ( 873) the famus Mohammed ibn Abdullah ibn Reshid succeeded to the Amirate and he ruled with good policy without and within, and his sway increased daily, and the house of Saud declined, and the former obtained lull authority over all Nejd, which from 1301 to 1315 (1883 to 1897) was undis puted and the land was flourishing in happiness and security, and he died and his brother's son Abdul Aziz ibn Mut'ab-al Rashid held the Amirate till* 1319 (1903), and he walked in the footsteps of his uncle, and the people were in the greatest comfort and security, only Abdul Aziz was a stubborn man of independent judgment who would not take advice and this injured his position in home and foreign affairs, and his determination and courage were ot no avail, and his adherents fell away from him as he would not consult them but made little of them. • He held the Amirate 4 or 5 yeirs longer until Mut'ab ibn Abdul Aziz acceded in 1324 (see below), but the autlnr meaaa that during those 4 or 5 years he fell away from the good coursa he had previously tollowed. 3Hesuscilation of the Amir ate of Saud —Mubarak as Subah Sheikh of ^ two brothers Mahommed and Jerrah in Zil Kaadah 1313 (1890), and the sons of the two killed ones took refuge with their maernalt uncle 1 usui Ibrahim famed for his wealth and his generous protection of suppliants, and tnose sons had recourse also to the Ottoman Government in the Vilayet of Busra in the time of Vali Hamdi Pasha, and Mubarak became afraid from what he knew of Yusuf and of the right of the Ottoman Government to interfere, but these matters need not be detailed as they are generally known. And to protect himself Mubarak thought of getting the Amirs of the house of baud and of the people of Kasim who dwelt in the neighbourhood of Kowietto be stumbling-blocks in the way of Ibn Eashid, for he knew the latter to be an agent ot the Ottoman Government, and feared the Government might incite lum to conquer Kowiet from the land side, and in fact Ibn Rashid did submit this idea to the Palace at Yildiz more than once, but the Government did not a ? P v r0 ^ i ' f S thG Government w as under the influence of intriguers employ ed by Mubarak who, for money considerations, opposed the policy of protecting tue sons ot the two slam princes and their maternal uncle Yusuf' ibn Ibrahim, so that he, Yusuf ibn Ibrahim, excused himself and withdrew to India : and when the Ottoman Government heard of the departure of Yusuf ibn Ibrahim it suggested to Ibn Eashid to send for him (to Hail) and the Government set about making peace between Mubarak and the sons of his brothers : and Ibn Kaslnd obeyed and sent for Yusuf ibn Ibrahim, and when the latter went to ±1 ail, Mubarak took alarm and tried to send on a raid into the desert against Ibn Eashid the Amirs of the house of Saud and of Kasim who were near him, but tney refused as they knew they were too weak, and he put compulsion on them and to please him they went out and for six years they assailed the Amirale of Ibn Eashid, and the men of the Palace turned against Ibn Kashid owing to the golden arguments used by Mubarak; and only the Sultan himself remained favourable to him, in spite of the oahimmators who tried to turn him against him for be knew the truth about the Amirates of ibn Saud and Ibn Kaslncl, that the former wanted the kingdom and the kbalifate and the latter the Aiuirate under the shadow of the Ottoman Crescent; but the intriguers prevented the Sulfan from helping Ibn Eashid and from noticing the misdeeds TI lbn kaud, and this was due to the preponderance of the party of Abdul liuda (May God requite every traitor to his Government and his countrv with what he deserves) So to the present day Mubarak as Subah, Sheikh of Kowiet is the main force for the support of the Amirate of Ibn Saud, only in the last years he is majong a show of coquetting with Ibn Eashid, but in reality he is stiii helping Ibn Saud with money and men and arms and ammunition. Also there has been internal discord in the Amirate of Ibn Eashid and men of the house have murdered one the other, and these matters are well known and need not be detailed here. Jmirate of Mufahibn Abdul Aziz ibn Rashid .—ISH (1906).~~' Eq assumed the Amirate with the help of the tribe Shammar at the age of ]8, and his maternal uncles (the sons of Hamud al Ubeid) Sultan and Saud and Paisal were envious ot the younger man getting the Amirate and they combined to slay the Amir Mut ab and his brothers and his cousins on his father's side and they succeeded in their plot (I mean these were killed Mut'ab and his brothers and the son of his paternal uncle). During his Amirate of nine months Sultan and his brothers had full control of the affairs of the Amirate but this did not suffice without the title. Now Sultan assumed the Amirate (January IJO 7 ), and envy and hatred sprang up among the three brothers, so that Sultan was obhged to approach the Subhans, who had been the Vazirs of the Amirate before Mut'ab, and who are the maternal uncles of the present Amir ibn Abdul Aziz ibn Eashid a boy of 10 who was living with them. God, through the Subhans, protected the child from the plot of the sons of Hamud 0r / the three 80118 of Hamucl became more sharp the Subhans were afraid for the boy, and the chief of them Hamud as Subhan feigning illness went away with the boy, taking his own valuables with him, 45 to Medina where they took up their abode. The Sultan and his jast ministers thanked Hamud as Subhan, and gave him and the boy a sufficient allowance. (May God exalt the Ottoman Government and give it glorious victory). Killing of Sultan ibn Hamud ul Oheid ihn Rashid.—Hahial Awwal 1326 {April 1908). —Sultan having assumed the Amirate sent his brother Faisal as Governor of Jauf (in the extreme north of Nejd), and kept with him as his Yizier his brother Saud. Bad feeling arose between the two (the Amir and his brother the Vizier). Finally Saud killed his brother the Amir (God save us from such doings). Now Abdul Aziz ibn Abdul Eahman of the house of Ibn Saud, seeing the discord in the house of ibn Rashid, wished to profit by it and began an open correspondence with the Amir Sultan, and at the same time a secret one with tjhat Amir's enemies. He corresponded with Bedouins and settled Arabs within Nejd, and with the Ottoman Government and Amirs on the Persian Gulf outside, and European observers thought that he would obtain without resistance control over all Nejd, but he knew this could not be without the help of the Amir (that is the Amir for the time being of the house of Ibn Rashid) and Sheiks of Shammar, as, until 40 years ago, these Amirs were always in the position of independent allies and helpers of the ihn Sauds, recognising their authority especially in the southern^ western ( ? ), and eastern parts of the Nejd, and getting from Rigad yearly subsidies, and had full authority over the north and westward as far as Medina and eastward as far as Samawab and A1 Husain and Meshed. Therefore this Ibn Saud approached the Chiefs of Shammar, and stirred up the strife in the family of Ibn Rashid, but it was of no avail for most of the Chiefs of Shammar remembered Moham med Ibn Rashid famous for his justice and good policy : and all the Chiefs swore on the Koran fidelity to the house of Ibn Kashid. Now at this time Hamud al Subhan and his brothers and his cousins were in Medina, and with them the boy, second son of Abdul Aziz ibn Rashid, their nephew on the mother's side. And those chiefs who swore fidelity to the house of Ibn Rashid had sworn at the same time to purify the Amirate from the rule of the house of Ubeid, that is from the rule of Sultan Saud and Eaisal. They wished the boy to govern under the tutelage of the Subhans who had from the old times always been viziers of the Ibn Rashids and are of the best blood of Shammar closely allied by marriage with the Ibu Rashids, and are men of weight and wealth and, though forming one family with the Amirs, still having each separate property, whereas the Amir possesses nothing but what he amasses before his accession, but what he collects when Amir is called Bait Mai and no one may spend any of it not even the Vmir himself, the Council having full power of the purse. Details of the revenue of Nejd here followTaxes (1) on each camel, J Maria Teresa dollar—about 5(Numbers of camels under 10 exempt), J Ottoman lira on each 40 sheep (numbers of sheep under 40 exempt), 5 per cent on produce of crops and palms]. The resistance of Bedo uins to the above taxes on animals sometimes provokes the Amir to send ex peditions against them of which the results vary. When the expedition is successful the Bedouins have to pay the expenses of it. After Sultan al Hamud had been Amir for one year he and his brothers formed the plan of dividing among themselves the large treasure of the Bait al Mai; and this increased the irritation of the chiefs of Shammar who sent an urgent message to Hamud al Subhan in Medina to come and save Shammar from the traitor, and he responded to their call and went with them and the result is known. Accession of Saud ihn Ahdul Aziz ibn JRashid,—-Hejeh 1326 {August 1908). —He was acclaimed ^y all the chiefs. His age was 11. His guardian was (as has been stated) Hamud-al-Subhan his maternal uncle. For three months the latter worked at the internal affairs of Nejd, and brought them back to the good state of the time of Mohammed ibn Abdur Rashid, and then he turned to external politics. He won over the neighbouring Arabs by their good opinion of him, and the more distant ones by force of arms, and no Arabs of Nejd remained on the side of Ibn Saud except some of the tribe of Muteyr, and of the men of Kasim and Woshm and Sadeyr and Mahmal; and dearth is chronic among ail those above named, and those people are helpless from theMm btssfeitfc'; • i mm barrennesa of the soil and the dearness of provisions, whereas the territories of Ibn Rashid are all fertile. So most of Nejd is inclined to Ibn Rashid from ill-feeling against Ibn Sand and from a belief that the omens are against him. The complete downfall of Ibn Sand would seem near, only that Mubarak Ibn- as Sabah (Sheikh of Koweit) has renewed his assistance so that perhaps with continual struggling the rule of Ibn Saud may be maintained for a year or two. It now looks as if Mubarak is drawing back and does not care which of the two parties prevails, as he is openly clinging to the skirts of the Ottoman Government and secretly to the English Government. It is probable that the Ottoman Government has designs of subsidising and conciliating Ibn Saud, think ing that he can settle the affairs of Nejd, whereas he has really no power to settle or stir up anything, but the Government is misled by its ignorance and by Intriguers, though it will soon find again the right path—that of friendship with Ibn Rashid. As we have said, Ibn Rashid, unlike Ibn Saud, is loyal to the Sultan, and in his territory prayers are offered for the Sultan every Friday. Lately Hamud as Subhan guardian of the young Amir died. His death in no way shook the Amirate, as there are 25 men of the Subhans of whom each is capable to take his place ; and the young Amir will always have good coun sellors, and when he has grown up, will have learnt the value of good counsel; and the Ottoman Government helps them by its new constitution, and no doubt that constitutional programme will, under the auspices of the Ottoman Govern ment, be introduced in Nejd. Amirate of Saud ihn Abdul Aziz ibn Hashid {August 1908) —The Ottoman Government accepted and confirmed his accession and assigned him and his maternal uncles, the Subhans, sufficient allowances, and gaves them ranks and decorations, and gave Saud ibn Abdul Aziz the title ' Amir of !Nejd ,5 , and gave instructions accordingly to all the valis of the Turkish Ara bian Provinces, those of Baghdad, Basra, Aleppo, Damascus and Hejas, and to Mutessarifs such as the Mutessarifs of Medina, Hassa and Nejf. The favour of the Ottoman Government towards the house of Ibn Rashid is well known to all Arabs. Ibn Rashid is glad to receive firmans of investiture from the Ottoman Government, under whose feet he places his cheeks as all the Ibn Rashids have done ever since the first coming of the Egyptians into Arabia.

(The author then makes an unintelligible statement which seems to mean that some of the above are not under the Amir of Nejd but directly subject to the Ottoman Empire or to Oman. Next he seems to say that twice as many as the above 464,000 are included in the Vilayet of Hejaz, the Mutessariflik of Assir, and the territory of Oman which is surprisingly mentioned a second time. This statistical passage is hopelessly confused). ^ Tribe of Shammar. —This is the greatest tribe of Nejd. Allied with them and akin to them are tribes, numbering over 100,000, living in Mesopotamia and paying tribute to the Ottoman Government. In Nejd they are the strongest of the Bedouins, as the Amir has for some generations been one of them and the Amir for the time being, that is each Amir, has seen that they are well armed with modem weapons, and that their horses are good, so that now they have the best horses in Arabia. The town of Hail, which is the seat of Government, and its dependent villages, are well equipped for war. Now Ibn Sand has none of the above tribes on his side. His tribes are remnants of scattered tribes, and he depends entirely on the settled Arabs of Eiad and the adjoining villages. And as the Amirate was torn from the Ibn Sauds 45 years ago, and they have been exposed to continual attacks ever since, they have deteriorated in respect of horses and arms, and have lost much trade : and most of the people have left for Hassa and Bahrein and have never come back. On the other hand Ibn Eashid has large resources, sufficient for his warlike purposes ; his Government is mild ; the taxes light. Ibn Rashid, as has always been the peculiar custom of his house, receives every fugitive suppliant, whatever his offence may have been, and if possible arranges the matter, or if that is impossible, lets him go in peace, but if the matter touches the Amir him self, the offence is usually pardoned by him; and this attracts many to offer allegiance to Ibn Eashid, whereas the practice of the Ibn Sauds has been the contrary, and especially in the last Amirate. Ibn Eashid has the support of the Governments of all the neighbouring Ottoman Vilayets, and is highly esteemed by the Ottoman Parliament and by the Committee of Union and Progress. His telegram of congratulation on the opening of Parliament gave great satisfaction to the Parliament and the whole Ottoman nation. Said Talib Nakib (of Basra ?) is an exception, but he is a personal enemy of Tbn Eashid and is of the followers of Abdul Huda the friend of the Sheikh of Koweit and of Ibn Saud. May God protect the Ottoman nation and the representatives, and the Committee of Union and the Victorious Army, and make harmony for the general good between the sections of the people, Moslem, Christian and Jewish. Dated 22nd March 1909. P.S. —The recent news of Nejd has reached me since writing the above. I will treat of it later. His BrUannio Majesty's Consul, Jeddah, to Sir O. A. Lowther. No. 25. J eddah ; May 30th, 1909. S ie, With reference to my despatches No. 17 of 9th April last, and No. 23 of 15th instant, I have the honour to report that I have received the following 7information from the author o£ the pamphlet of which translation was enclosed in the second despatch above referred to :— ' During the past four months IbnRashid has been chastising the Bedouins of Nejd, who had risen against him, and three or four encounters have taken place and the Bedouins, and settled Arabs also, have been filled with dread. But Ibn Saud, whose territory's barren,'and who is badly provided with riding animals and sheep and cattle, cannot show such activity as Ibn Basbid. On the 21st May (new European style) men of the Uteyba and Harb tribes came to Mecca and agreed in their information that Ibn Saud came out from his territory in hostile array against some Bedouins belonging to the Harb and Shammar tribes and subject to Ibn Easbid, and took a part of their encampments but could not take their animals. Ibn Bashid having heard of this, went in pursuit of Ibn Saud, and in three days came up with him in a place called Uruk, a monntain three days' distant from Kasim, and shortly before dawn attacked him and the fight lasted till about two hours before noon, and Ibn Saud was routed and pursued till nightfall. In the result 200 men of Ibn Saud'sside were killed and 40 of Ibn Bashid's and a large number of horses and camels were taken by Ibn Bashid, and Ibn Saud with the remainder of his men took refuge in Aneza, and Ibn B,ashid returned to his own country. Ibn Sand's cause is continually failing inNejd, and the people are inclining towards Ibn Bashid, and it is expected that by the end of this year the latter will be master of all Nejd. As to the Bedouins of Hejaz they are being brought to tranquillity by the wise measures of the Grand Sherif. The great Harb sub-tribes of Masruh and Beni Salim (who have been attacking the railway) have all offered their submission and their guarantees, according to Arab custom, to the Grand Shereef, declaring that they will no longer attack the railway.' This information says nothing of the Ottoman troops alleged, by the news paper mentioned in my despatch No. 17 above referred to, to have taken part in the recent events in Nejd, nor have I learnt anything in support of the allegation. mmmmmmmmrnm — Lately several Sheikhs of the Harb tribe came to Mecca, where some of them still remain and made submission to the Government as is stated by my present informant.

S ir, With reference to my despatch No. 23 of the 15th instant, enclosing a pamphlet on Nejd affairs, I have the honour to submit the following observa tions on 'Wahhabism. Wahhabism seems to be dying out in the Hejaz, though a few small Bedouin sub-tribes still profess it. Senoussism, of which there is an official representative in Mecca is the most active religious force among the Hejaz Bedouins and especially in the Great Harb tribe. In the towns, Mecca, Medina, Jeddah, and Yambo, there are no avowed Wahhabis, the populations having a certain horror of the sect and regarding them as hypocrites, but there are in Mecca and Jeddah many known to belong to the sect and distinguished for their abstinence from tobacco and^general puritanism. I have not been able 8(W) 00249 to obtain figures, but understand that some hundreds in Mecca and a score or 9 bel ^ two in Jeddah are known as Wahhabis. Among them in each of the two towns are* two or three families of Delhi Indians, A member of one is the Chief Clerk of this consulate. These Indian Wahhabis seem eminent among Wahhabis for sanctimontious gravity and for dislike of western civilisation. Though they have a strong leaven of hypocrisy, their morality seems really excellent, but their minds seem especially thick with the Wahhibi rust of which Doughty so often speaks. They feel, I imagine, certainly no sentimental loyalty towards British rule. Of Wahhibism in Nejd I have little information beyond what is given in this partisan pamphlet, but I gather that the pamphlet is correct in represent ing it as hopelessly decayed except in the comparatively small part under the immediate control of Ibn Saud. The author's own family is from the Wah- babi centre Aneyza and is represented by Doughty, 30 years ago, as mostly Wahhabi : but it is now all decidedly anti-Wahhabi. The author's cousin suffered long imprisonment at the hands of Ibn Saud on the occasion of the latter's triumph in 1906. In Yemen I understand that Wahhabism has no power. I have, etc., (Sd.) J. H. MONAHAN. P.S. —I now (June 1st) learn that the correct numbers of Wahhabi Indians are as follows ;—In Mecca one large family of Delhi Indians, in the several branches, and some other Indian families, in all 50 or 60 persons ; and in Jeddah two or three Delhi Indian small families. (ltd). J. H. M. Sis Britannic Majesty's Consul, Damascus i to Sir O. Lowther, Damascus ; July 7th, 1909. Sir, With reference to my despatch No. 33 of the 5:8th May last, I have the honour to report that the child Ibn Eashid, under the guardianship of his maternal uncle Zamil Ibn Sebhan, proceeded after the fight mentioned in the despatch under reference to consolidate his forces and array under his flag as many tribes as he could, and according to reports that reach Damascus he has been so far successful in his object. It has been just heard that the powerful tribe of Muteir who used to be the right arm of Ibn Saud threw off allegiance to the latter and joined Ibn Rashid who telegraphed three days ago to a friend in this city stating that most of the Kassimites together with the Muteir are now his partisans and he hopes that in a short time he will be able to crush his rival Ibn Saud and be the master of the whole Nejd. (However as he does not seem to be a man of determined will judging from what was previously reported that he was more inclined to shirk than to seek an engagement pos- sibly his hopes will not attain fruition even now.) Bureideh town is still loyal to Ibn Saud who counts also very much upon the friendship of Ibn Sabah of Koweit. The Turkish Government of late took no active part in the dispute but uphold Ibn Eashid to whom they pay £ T. 160 per month, (half as much as 910 his father used to draw), and hope that he will be able one day to crush the Wahhahis who denounce all other Moslems as infidels : and presumably Ottoman influence and aid would definitely decide the day in his favour. I now have the honour to return the four Jeddah despatches (received under cover, dated 16th ultimo) remarking that however prejudiced may be S. Bassam's pamphlet for Ibn Rashid assuredly Ibn Saudi has of late lost influence and prestige in Nejd, which have accrued to his opponent. In fact the Kassim people, upon whom Ibn Saoud ever relied, are growing impatient of these incessant raids and anxious for rest. Turks and Syrians generally incline towards Ibn Rashid strongly, though Anezah tribe (the chief and largest of the Syrian Desert) favour Ibn Sand, but are little concerned, a long way off, and far from zealous on his behalf. Ibn Eashid has the powerful Shammar tribe to draw upon for forces, but his rival has no equivalent resource, and may soon perhaps enjoy little else than traditional respect and honour as hereditary Amir of the Wahbabis.

I have the honour to refer to the correspondence regarding affairs in Nejd forwarded under your endorsement No. 2996, dated the November 1909. 2. The correspondence was particularly interesting as giving a more detailed and frank exposition of the position of affairs and politics in Central Arabia than is generally obtainable from local enquiries, and as this description was from a point of view distinctly partial to the Ibn Rashid faction I have been at some pains to test the information from available sources in Kuwait which may be assumed as equally partial to the Wahabi chief. 3. In discussing with Shaikh Mubarak the present position and influence of the two leaders, I gathered that the prestige of Bin Saud has undoubtedly suffered from the bad seasons his territories have experienced and the conse quent weakness of his camels and mares and the high prices of food-stuffs, whilst the Shammar Chief has by comparison a full treasury, his people have had good crops and their riding cattle are in good condition. As the Shaikh expressed it ' the power of the Arab is in his camels and mares.' Shaikh Mubarak would not admit that there had been defections from Bin Saud of any large numbers of the tribes he formerly counted as his adherents and asserted that as far as available men went Bin Saud was the more powerful though he had not the sinews of war in money, provisions and animals. This view, however, was not confirmed by a well-informed Arab merchant, who admitted that there had really been large defections from Bin Saud and, as he naively said, the Bedouin will cleave to him who appears the stronger at the moment. It is worthy of note that both the Wahabi leader and Ibn Eashid have not indulged in any serious expeditions for some months, each remaining at his capital ^the reasons ascribed for this truce are the weakness of the former combined with the respect of the latter for the considerable opposition he would certainly encounter in any attempt on Bin Saud s villages and populated tracts. It may be taken as a fact, therefore, that tne two Powers in Central Arabia are more or less in equilibrium. It is undoubtedly Shaikh Mubarak's policy to maintain this equilibrium, and I have been told more than once that all Shaikh Mubarak's dealings with the Bedouin tribes have for their ultimate object this balance, together with his own aggrandizement, whereby his support becomes and remains the most desired end of each of the rival chiefs. 4. On the whole, I am inclined to think that if a considerable allowance is made for the partiality displayed in Sulaiman Bassam's pamphlet, he gives a tolerably accurate presentiment of Central Arabian affairs and politics.

Captain Shakespear gives an interesting account of Abdul Aziz, who, owing to the age and infirmity of his father, is now recognised as ' Bin Saud ' and the head of the Wahabi faction. Bin Saud appears to be a fine specimen of an Arab Chieftain. 3. I have to-day received your telegram No. S.-180, dated 19th instant, and will convey the required warning to the Shaikh at the first possible opportunity. It appears tome, however, from the report received from Kuwait, that the expe dition must have started from Jahra before the 15th instant when the report reached me. (214) 00252 From Captain W. H. /. Shakespear, I.A., Political Agent, Kuwait, to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, No. 0.-12, dated Kuwait, the Qth March 1910. With reference to the entries in my diary for February, regarding Bin Saud, I have the honour to submit a report dealing in fuller detail with the visit of the Wahabi prince to Shaikh Mubarak and the simultaneous movement of large sections of the Bedouin tribes'flocking to their standards, which forecast an expedition, and the magnitude of which is entirely out ot proportion to the ostensible reasons I have so far been able to elicit from Shaikh Mubarak or local gossip. 2. Just before my departure into camp Shaikh Mubarak casually informed me that Abdul Aziz bin Abdur Rahman general^referred to as 'Bin Saud,' who, though his aged father is still alive and titular Amir, practically rules South- West Nejd, was in the desert a few days south of Assafa and might possibly com&amp;to Kuwait on a visit. I asked the Shaikh to le so good as to let me know in camp by a special messenger if Bin Saud really did come into Kuwait, as I had heard much of him and v should like the opportunity of meeting so distinguished a man. * 3. On my arrival from tour on the 28th February I found that Abdul Aziz had arrived two days earlier, accompanied by his young brother Saud and his son Turki, a lad of about 12 years of age. On the 1st March two more brothers of Abdul Aziz arrived, Mahomed and Sa'ad. Shaikh Mubarak has been even more lavish in his hospitality on this occasion than his usual very generous wont, and at a very rough guess the entertainment of and presents to these princes and their, following cannot have cost the Shaikh less than some $ 20,000. 4. I had three opportunities of meeting the Bin Saud family and found them, in spite of their Wahabi reputation, much interested in the ways of foreigners and the outer world. They dined with me and appeared to appreciate a W est- ern table and menu, and also submitted to the camera. 5. Abdul Aziz is a fair, handsome man, considerably above the average Arab height, with a particularly ftank and open face and, after the first shyness, genial and, very courteous manners. He informed me that he was in his 31st year. His brother-Mahomed (son of a different mother) is perhaps a year younger, and though in feature not unlike Abdul Aziz, is of rather dour aspect and taciturnsgffsae fy.a&gt;^.-:..5ase3: 2 manner. Saud and Sa'ad, the next two brothers in point of age, are about 26, the former being Abdul Aziz's full brother, very fair for an Arab and of pleasant address. Abdulla, the youngest, is only about 16 years of age. 6. All struck me as particularly intelligent, and Abdul Aziz as a broad-minded, straight' man, who could probabl3 T be trusted farther than most Arabs. His reputation amongst Arabs is that of a noble, generous and just man who does not descend to mean actions. The deference paid by him to Shaikh Mubarak was remarkable and though partly due by Arab etiquette to the latter's age and position as host may also have been induced by the many proofs of his wealth and lavish generosity. 7. Abdul Aziz did not discuss politics with me beyond remarking that he thanked God there were no Turks nearer to his capital than those in El Hasa, and that the English as the friends and brothers of Mubarak-as-Subah were thereby his friends and brothers. He had often heard Colonel Felly's visit to Riadh spoken of, but had never seen a white man in the place nor in fact ever in his life before the present occasion. He offered me a welcome should I ever contemplate a tour so far afield as Riadh. 8. Previous to Bin Baud's departure the Ajman Shaikhs against whom the pre sent expedition was originally planned by Shaikh Mubarak as retribution for a series of raids on Kuwait camels, made their submission and it is said that through Abdul Aziz's good offices Shaikh Mubarak has forgiven the Ajman their depre dations, and in their turn they have now placed their fighting men at his disposal for the impending campaign. 9. The Wahabi princes left Kuwait on the 4th March to rejoin their camp which was to have moved on the 7th March from a day south of Kuwait to join forces with Shaikh Mubarak's Contingent preparatory to a combined campaign. 10. Shaikh Mubarak informed me that his force was intended to punish one of the Thaffir Shaikhs who joined Shaikh Sadunofthe Muntifich in a recent small raid. Another rumour from the bazar has it that the present expedition is be ing made at the suggestion of the Wali of Basra, who recently met the Shaikh at Fao, and, if there is any truth in this, which I doubt, it would appear that the Turkish authorities having realized their inability either to collect revenue from the Munti fich or to punish their contumacy, have resorted to the expedient of setting a Bedouin to catch a Bedouin. Neither of these objects would require more than 2,000 or 3,000 men for its effective conclusion. It is exceedingly difficult to estimate the numbers now gathered at Jahra, but I may mention that Shaikh Mubarak said to me in conversation that he had some 6,000 to 8,000 men collected and Bin Saud as many more. I believe these numbers to be greatly exaggerated though it is a fact that the combined forces contain very strong contingents from the following tribes Ajman, Umtair, Awazim, Bani Hajir, Bani Khalid, A1 Morrah, Ateyba, Sbi'a , Kahtan, at-Towata, the whole of the Kuwait Araibdar and the personal follow ers of the Bin Saud and Bin Subah families. The estimates of the various tribal Shaikhs who have lately visited me, though notoriously unreliable, all put the num ber of horsemen at between 2,500 and 3,500, with the thaluls (riding-camels) ' without number as grains of sand.' It is probable that the camelry number quite 8,000 to 9,000 . The demand for equipment has been such that the price of an average thalul has risen by quite 25 per cent., that there is hardly a single article of camel-equipment or clothing to be had in the usually well-stocked bazars, and the prices of arms, ammunition, rice, coffee and other commodities have all advanced. All merchants, boat-owners, shopkeepers, etc., have been laid undei heavy contributions in money or goods, and it is said that the desert from A1 Hasa northwards is destitute of fighting men, whilst numbers continue to come in from the more distant grazing grounds further west. 11. Nothing on the scale of the present expedition has been planned since that which ended in the disaster of Sarif in 1901. Gossip is now coming to the con clusion that though the expedition may exact retribution from the Thaffir Shaikhs and Shaikh Sadun for their small raids, it is probably intended against the Shammai and Ibn Rashid. This opinion is surmise founded on the good ground that no force approaching the present in strength has been raised either by Mubarak or Bin00253 3 Sand It or years, and as Abdul Azix will be virtual Commander-in-Chief in the field, it is unlikely that he will forego the opportunity of trying conclusions with his rival when circumstances have given him so good a chance of success. 12. Shaikh Mubarak is at Jahra and will return in a day or two after the com bined forces leave. He will not accompany them himself, it is said, because Abdul Aziz dissuaded him on account of his age and health and because the Shaikh has a degree of confidence in Abdul Aziz's military and political ability, which he cei- tainly does not repose in his son Jabir or the Kuwait leaders Commanding the Bin Subah Contingent.

You will see that the Government of India direct that a warning should be conveyed to the Shaikh in terms of the previous warning, not to enter into anv operations calculated to involve him in difficulties in Nejd or with the Turks. The previous warning to which the Government of India refer was conveyed to Shaikh Mubarak personally by Lieutenant-Colonel Kemball, C I E., the then Resident, in October 1901, when the Shaikh was contemplat ing an expedition in force against Ibn Eashid. The former warning was dis regarded by the Shaikh. 3. On that occasion Lieutenant-Colonel Kemball was instructed &lt;c to visit Kuwait and ascertain the state of affairs regarding tension between the _ Amir of Nejd and Mubarak and counsel the Shaikh to avoid by all means in his power any display of activity which might afford Turkey excuse for greater interference in Kuwait affairs.' 4. I would suggest that at an interview with Shaikh Mubarak you should make an opportunity of referring to the recent expedition and warn the Shaikh against engaging in any expedition which is calculated to bring him into collision with the Turks. Shaikh Mubarak will, no doubt, insist that^ the ex pedition is against the Muntafik and agreeable to the Turks, but it will be as well to let him understand that a policy of adventure in the interior does _ not itself to Government. Perhaps the President who is due on Priday next may take an opportunity of visiting the Shaikh, but it seems advisable to deliver the warning at once.■ Nc. 11. Copy forwardad to H.M.

I submit also an extract from the diary of the Political Agent, Kuwait, dealing with the latter's engagement. 2. It would appear that, to begin with at any rate, Bin Saud and Shaikh Jabir marched against the Muntafik in accordance with their intentions and that they found Sadun Pasha with a much stronger force than they expected, and suffered defeat at his hands. B asra, March 26, 1910. No. 16. Sir, The following information has reached me regarding recent fighting in the direction of the Eurphrates and in the Sanjak of Montifik. On March 12 the ' Senajir'' a section of the ' Abouda ' tribe with the followers attacked the town of Shattara at night and pillaged the bazaars. A sharp engagement ensued between the Arabs and the Turkish troops stationed there with the result that the Turks suffered considerably, losing a Major, two officers and 23 soldiers killed and about 30 men wounded. On the Arab side several men were killed and some wounded. Further details about the affairs have not reached Basra, The inha bitants of Shattara are of the Abouda tribe which is divided into two sections of which u As-Senajir ' oppose the Turks and Ash-Shamkhi ' support them. I understand in the recent fighting the ' Ash-Shamkhi ' section helped the Turkish troops against their fellow townsmen. The growing enmity which arose last year between Shaikh Mubarak of Kuwait and Sadu Pasha out of some disagreement in commercial matters, has recently culminated in open hostilities. Bin Saud has been visiting Kuwait and accompanied by Shaikh Jabir, Mubarak's eldest son^ and a large number of Arabs proceeded a short time ago to a place in the desert, of which I have not yet learnt the name about three days march north-west of Zobair, They were met there by Sadun and his followers and severe fighting is said to have occurred, in which Bin Saud and Jabir suffered considerable loss in camels, horses and rifles captured by the enemy. There does not seem to have been much loss of life on either side. Bin Saud and Jabir fled from the field after the defeat and were pursued by a large number of Arabs from the Montafik tribes who sallied across the Euphrates to support Sadun. A further engagement is expected shortly. It is said that Shaikh Mubarak remained at Jahra near Kuwait during the expedition and on hearing the result immediately returned to Kuweit. A telegram from a Turkish officer in Montafik to his father at Basra says the route from Nasriyah to Shattara is very dangerous. , I am informed that the presence of the Arabs of Bin Saud in the neigh bourhood of Katif has alarmed the Turks and that the commodore HikmetPasha, who left on board the 'Marmaris' on the 3rd instant for Katif, ostensibly for the purpose of establishing guard stations between Hofuf and Ojair, has been despatched there to enquire the reasons for their appearance in that neighbourhood. I have, etc., F. E. CROW. His Excellency the Right Hon'ble Sir G. A. Lowther, K.C.M.G., C.B., etc., etc., etc., Extract from Kuwait Diary No. 12, for the week ending 23rd March igto. 20th, —Report reached Kuwait to-day of the defeat of the Bin Subah and Bin Saud fighting forces by Shaikh Saadun of the Muntafik on the 16th March between Ar Rakhaimiya, Wagubaand Zaraibiat, It appears that on that date the combined force early in the morning attacked first and defeated the Muntafik who retired without any great loss. Shortly afterwards Shaikh Saadun delivered a vigorous counter attack from a flank against the right wing composed of Kuwait Araibdar and Umtair Bedouins and apparently the Kuwait men made no attempt at a stand, Shaikh Jabir and his followers fleeing almost at once, leaving the Bin Subahwar-flag and half their 'Thaluls' in the hands of the enemy. Meanwhile Bin Saud and his brothers supported by the Ajman on the left wing were engaged with others of Shaikh Saadun's force and appeared to have made gallant efforts to save the day. In retreating which they seem to have carried out methodically, they made three stands but owing to the flight of the Kuwait men were powerless to turn a defeat into victory. In the first successful attack, the Ajman secured about 50 horses from the Dhafir who directly opposed them. The disaster is said to have been due partly to the surprise and vigour of Saadun's counter attacks, and mainly to Saadun's forces being far larger than was anticipated especially in horsemen. The report goes that Saadun besides his Muntafik Bedouin, had with him 500 horsemen of the Shammar, nearly all the Dhaffir sections and the Lbadur, Zaid, Smait, As-Safa, A1 Magarid, Bani Malik, Ash Shraifat, Bani Hussaini, Ar, Rafaiah, Al Fathool, Al Khazaal, Bani Hawaikim, Bani Lami, Bani Khagan, Bani Said and others. The force under his command contained nearly 4,000 horsemen, a large number of dismounted men and no Thaluls, whilst the Bin Subah and Bin Saud combined force was largely composed of Thalul riders with only 1,000 horsemen. It is said if Bin Saud had not been present the Bin Subah forces would have been completely destroyed. Only a few casualties so far are reported on the Bin Subah side, none of the bigger shaikhs having been killed. It is said Shaikh Saadun ordered that none of the enemy should be put to death, that only their arms should be taken and the men allowed to go unmolested. The force is returning to Jahra and awaits Shaikh Mubarak's orders, though it is considered certain fresh efforts will be made at once as a second attempt launched at Saadun as soon as reinforcements have been collected. 21st. —Shaikh has ordered lists to be made of all the townsmen from which to choose men for a second expedition against the Muntafik Shaikh. It is rumoured that Shaikh has bought 1,000 camels from a Syrian. He is undoubtedly making arrangements on a much bigger scale than before and, it is said, has asked help from Shaikh Khazal; whilst Bin Saud, it is said, has summoned his Nejada to join in the new raid. Bin Saud has purchased Arab clothes worth Dollars 1,000 for distributions amongst the Bedouins who have lost their belongings in the last raid. There is a renewed heavy demand for camels and fire-arms in Kuwait and everybody seems busy over some detail or other in connection with the forth coming raid. This time, it is said, all Bedouins will be ordered to take their families with them for their presence is supposed to infuse a higher courage in the fighting men. G C. B.P., Simla»—No. C. 172 F.

T , . r , 7r tical Agent, Kuwait, regarding the Kuwait expedition against Shaikh Sadun. 2. Despatch of the papers has been somewhat delayed owing to my absence last week, and as my latest information is that a peaceable settlement is being negociated, I will defer offering comment until receipt of my next report. Mean while Captain Shakespear knows what line to take with Shaikh Mubarak. 3. A copy of the Political Agent's note on Shaikh Mubarak's military arrangements is being sent separately to the Chief of the Staff's Division, No. C .-14, dated Kuwait, the 3oih March 1910. From— Captain W. H. I. Shakespear, LA , Political Agent, Kuwait, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your First Assistant's letter No. 743, dated the 22nd March 1910, but before replying thereto it will be more convenient if I continue chronologically my report No, C .-I2, dated the 9th March, 2. For facility of reference I attach extracts from my diary which give in sufficient detail the accounts, as they were received of the reverse inflicted by Shaikh Sadun upon the Bin Subah and Bin Saud forces. 3. As a contrast to these accounts the following description of this ' regret- able incident ' as furnished to me by Shaikh Mubarak himself is interesting, if fallacious. The Shaikh said that the attack by the combined forces was in the first place badly planned : in spite of this fact, however, it was successful and broke up Shaikh Sadun's cavalry who fled leaving a number of dead on the field. Unfortunately the attack took place over the dried-up bed of a large rain-pool, from which a very heavy cloud of dust rose ; owing to the natural confusion of the attack and the subsequent impenetrable dust the combined horsemen who made the first attack lost their bearings whilst their supporting thalul ' riders (camelry) remained in ignorance as to what had resulted from the charge. Sadun, as he galloped out of the melee, apparently at once grasped the situation and with rare general-ship seems to have rallied his broken cavalry and led them round under cover of the dust to attack the bewildered camelry. The camelry naturally assum ing an attack upon them could not be possible without their horsemen having been already defeated, broke at once and fled to save their skins and ' thaluls Sadun having disposed of the camelry turned his attention to the horsemen who already confused by their first attack were wondering what had become of their supporting camelry. Receiving no support and being again attacked they also fled leaving Sadun master of the field. Shaikh Mubarak averred that his men lost very few of their camels and even succeeded in securing some of Sadun's mares in their first attack. He gave the casualties as only 3 men of his own Reshaida and some 120 of Sadun's men killed. Sadun's son, Thamir, had his mare killed under him, himself being shot through the thigh, whilst 5 of the smaller Dhaffir Shaikhs were amongst the dead on Sadun's side. The Shaikh denied that Sadun was supported by any Shammar, as reported in my diary ; he said that Sadun had asked Ibn Sebhan (Ibn Rashid's guardian and regent) for assist ance but the latter had refused it. 4. The few casualties on the Kuwait side show that the affair, in spite of Shaikh Mubarak's somewhat ingenious explanation, was undoubtedly a disgrace-ful flight. I have also heard since that Shaikh Jabir and Bin Saud did not have that singleness of purpose or plan which is essential to any military operation. It is apparently admitted that in point of numbers the combined Bin Saud and Bin Subah force was superior, though Sadun, who had no camelry at all, had a preponderance in horsemen. I am afraid that Shaikh Mubarak's tale of the losses is fictitious as from other sources I learn that among the killed (reported at anything up to 150) is a small Umtair Shaikh,; that the refugees have been returning to Jahra without clothes riding 5 and 6 to a camel, and promising Bedouin exhorbitant sums for transport to Kuwait. 5. As soon as news of the defeat reached the Shaikh he began fresh and energetic measures for the raising of another and larger force, and to this end minute details have been collected of the population, each man's wealth, number of able-bodied men. etc. The entire stock of arms and ammunition has been commandeered by the Shaikh from the arms-dealers, who are to receive bonds for their value drawn on the Customs receipts. There is much grumbling (though through fear of the Shaikh it is expressed in hushed whispers) at the amount of money contributions demanded, especially from foreigners such as the richer Persian merchants. 6. 1 have been fortunate in obtaining secretly some interesting details as to the Shaikh's organization for military purposes with an estimate of the numbers being collected for this second expedition, which 1 submit in a separate note attached hereto, as it may be of use to the Intelligence Branch at Army Head quarters. It will be seen that a force of some 15,000 men (including Kuwait levies, Bedouins and Bin Saud's contingent) is contemplated. The expedition is unpopular in the town chiefly on the score of the heavy expenses it entails on all and the fear that the Shaikh will resort to it as a pretext for further increasing taxation. However, there is no one who would dare to venture to suggest to the Shaikh that the game is not worth the candle, though it is a fact that the origin of these retributory steps against Shaikh Sadun was his successful raid (combined with the Dhaffir) of some 300 Kuwait sheep and a few camels. 7. On receiving your First Assistant's irstructions to convey a warning to the Shaikh I took the first opportunity of riding out to his camp at Sirra and bringing forward the subject. As ^as to be anticipated the Shaikh assured me that the Turkish authorities were w r ell pleased at his action against Sadun and that the Wali during his last visit to Fao had commended him and wished him success. Sadun was for some time a refugee from the Turkish authorities, but I hear that the Turks found him a still greater nuisance as an outlaw and so re instated him in some honorary post, though whether this is a fact I have no cer tain information. The Shaikh went on to explain that he intended nothing which could possibly involve him in conflict with them or with others, but that his honour as an Arab Shaikh w-as concerned, for his people had been robbed and Sadun had made no restitution of the property as* Shaikh Mubarak is generally successful in securing after such raids. His sole object was to punish Sadun and according to Arab ideas a counter-raid is certainly justified in default of re stitution. I recalled Colonel Kemball's warning to the Shaikh and explained that one could never tell to what result expeditions of this nature would lead even tually and for that reason such adventures did not commend themselves to Gov ernment. The Shaikh replied that he always bore Colonel Kemball's warning in mind but that in the present case he was practically forced to assert his authority to secure his people from molestation. 8. My previous impression (stated in my letter No. C-12 dated the 9th March 1910) that the expedition might posbibly be used for an excursion against Ibn Rashid has proved incorrect ; and therefore 1 was not able to suggest defi nitely the abandonment of the proposed second attempt, such a suggestion being an unwarrantable incursion into the Shaikh's own internal politics. I endeavoured to show him ho\v utterly incommensurate the best possible success would be with the cost of fitting out his force and after reiterating Government's disapproval&lt;?/&gt; % •.' I: 00261 a &gt; sfcl. came away with the Impression that the Shaikh has no intention of changing his mind. P.S. —Since the above ivas drafted I have heard that the entire force will be collected near Jahra within the next three or four days and that the Kuwait leaders are to receive their final instructions from Shaikh Mubarak on Friday (the i st April). Extracts from Kuwait Political Diary. 20th March. — Report reached Kuwait to-day of the defeat of the Bin Subah and Bin Saud fighting forces by Shaikh Sadun of the Muntafik on the 16th March between Ar Rakhaimiya, Waguba and Zaraiblat.

He has collected, ic is said, a large number of rifles from all the firearms dealers last night. He has also ordered lists to be made of all the townsmen from which to choose men for his second expedition against the Muntafik Shaikh. It is rumoured the Shaikh has bought 1,000 camels from a Syrian. He is undoubtedly making arrangements on a much bigger scale than before and, it is said, has asked help from Shaikh Khazal ; whilst Bin Saud has summoned his Nejada to join in the new raid.

Extracts from Diary No. 13 of the Kuwait Political Agency for the week ending 30th March igro. * * * 28th March. —It is reported that Shaikh Mubarak has made fresh demands from all Kuwait people. Those who had given one ' Khabra ' (a tent with seven men and five camels) for the first raid have now been asked to give seven camels and ten men. Even the lowest class of people have had to contribute. It is said that for the first raid the prostitutes were required to give coffee pots each one from one to three pots according to her means. This time, it is said, they have been asked to give bedding. Merchants who owe money to the Shaikh for dates and loans taken from him have been pressed for immediate payments but some are unable to comply having only goods and no ready cash. All carpenters have been commandeered by the Shaikh's men to make camel saddles, etc. There is great scarcity of camel equipments in the local market as what was available had been already bought up for the first raid. Camels and firearms are plentiful but their prices have almost doubled and the Bedouins are reaping a golden harvest over the latter. It is reported that Shaikh Mubarak has ordered men from Fao and Dora to come and join him for the forthcoming raid. * * « * 2gth March. —Among others who were killed in the recent raid, are Abdur Rahman ibn Hallaf of the Shaikhs of Us Said of the Dhaffir section and Lahil ibn Mundil of the Bani Khalid.

Shaikh Mubarak*s Military Arrangements. The unit of organisation is called a ' khabra ' and consists of :— 10 men with their arms. 7 ' Thaluls ' with their equipment. 1 tent. Food for as many days as may be ordered. The richer merchants are assessed individually to provide so many ' khabra' complete. Smaller tradesmen are lumped together as also are the Divers and Boat Nakhudas. The men required for these ' khabra ' would be mostly hired and paid by the persons providing the u khabra ' at from $ 6 to $ 8 a'month with food extra. Their arms and &lt;f thaluls' would belong to the khabra ' owner. Foreigners such as Persian merchants are assessed in cash at whatever sum the Shaikh considers he can safely extract from them. The Shaikh from this money and his own finances provides generally an equal number of ,f khabra ' buying the camels himself and supplying the arms and tents from his own stocks. Men required by the Shaikh for his ' khabra' in excess of his own permanent following would be impressed from the town people and do not receive any hire beyond their food. In addition to the above force, who would all be Kuwait town Arabs, the Shaikh calls out such sections or whole tribes of Bedouin as he may require.under their own Shaikhs ; these Bedouin join bringing their own mounts,mares or ' f thaluls and arms, whilst Shaikh Mubarak would supply them with food. He would also supply the whole force ^ith ammunition, probably 50 rounds per man. The numbers called out for the present (second) expedition against Sadun of the Muntafik are as follows :— 15 well-to-do Merchants to provide Small merchants and tradesmen provide,,. Divers and Boat-owners provide ».« Shaikh will fit out 75 'khabra''. 200 25 300 19 &gt;5 Total 600 khabra com plete. This means a force of 6,000 men with 4.,300 ' thaluls ' exclusive of Bedouin. Taking the cost of a 4&lt; thalul' with its gear at $ 200 and of a rifle at $ 35, with $ 5 as the cost of food for one man for 10 days, we get 2,100 &lt;f thaluls ' at $ 100 3,000 rifles at $ 35 3,000 men's food at $ 5 3,000 „ hire „ $ 7 Cost to merchants. • 210,000 , 105,000 , 15,000 21,000 Cost to Shaikh, 210,000 105,000 15,000 351,000 The Shaikh will probably have at least 6,000 other Bedouin to feed. And supply ammunition to whole force at 50 rounds per man for $ 3. $ 330,000 30,000 35. 0 oo This will give the Shaikh a force of some 12,000 men of whom half will be Bedouin, and the force will comprise some 3,000 cavalry, 7,000 camelry and 2,000 infantry. Its cost to the Shaikh for a 10 days'expedition will be about $ 396,000 and to the Kuwait merchants another $ 351,000. This estimate is, if anything, below the mark as no guess can be made at the cost of grain for horses, dates for camels, if worked hard, and clothes and cash presents to Bedouin. It must be remembered too that the estimate takes no account of the force which Bin Saud is placing at Shaikh Mubarak's disposal. He probably commands quite another 4,000 men including his Bedouin from the more southern tribes. The cost of feeding them will fall on Shaikh Mubarak, K uwait ; T/ie 28th March /p/o, I W. H. I.

It may be of interest to note that this territory would be_ included by a line joining Jazirat-al-Amayir* on the coast *(Or jmna? p. z.c.) with Anta's, thence to As-Safa, A1 Hafar, following A1 Batin to Ar Ratk, whence east-south-east to the Khor Um Kasr to just south of that fort, and the sea on the east.

I intend to submit a map with a list of the compass readings on which it is based, but it has not yet been completed and will be forwarded separately at a later date. 4.

My whole party, men and animals, benefited by the hard work and we all felt that our general condition and health on return was far better than at starting and due to the bracing tonic air of the open desert.

Zaid is the man's name and he is of the liblan Umtair; seems a capable fellow. The names of the Shaikh's two hawks are ' Barkat' a very fine Hurr, and ' Shalwah ' a Shihan not as good as my own Shihan (f jumlah As the trip is to^ be one with long distances between water-places, have decided to leave the Mullah behind and use his two camels for water and food.

Khalaf with three other of my Bedouins, a Bedouin chaprassi and Zaid the Shaikh's man. The live-stock consists of 13 hamlaa (baggage camels), 8 (&lt; thaluls ' (riding camels). 3 hawks, a greyhound and 11 sheep for meat. Am leaving two Bedouins—Mathoor and Mahomed bin Aamir— behind for the first two posts with orders for the former to meet me at Hafar on the 12th February and the latter at Rigai on the 16th February. 30th January. —Cloudy morning looking like rain, but we started, the loading up showing more method than on my first trip last November. Left the Agency at 9-30 A. M. and cleared the town in half-an-hour going due south. The road is a well-defined track with first hatf of march absolutely bare, but later we came on some grass, weeds and ' arafij ' grazing. Camped at 2-45 in a patch of good arafij ' just short of Malha with Burgan, Wara and Maadaniyat Hills all visible. Marching of the ' hamla ' not parti cularly good as hardly settled down to work on the first day. Rain came on in the evening and this probably means a late start to-morrow. 31st January. —Zaid joined us with the two hawks. Rain most of the night and as tents sopping wet decided to halt, but sun coming out dried^ up things rapidly so we managed to march at noon. Passed Malha wells in a little over an hour. The remains of what apparently was once a hut just above the wells are known as Kasr-i-Malha. Got to the, top of Wara Hill about 4 P.M , whence fine view. Hill seems to be a curious out-crop of some kind of lime stone rock jutting up 80 to 100 feet in an otherwise flat or very slightly undu lating plain. After another hour's march camped at 5 p.m., about north-west from Burgan Hill and not far from one of my previous camps. ' Hamla' marching fairly. ist February. —Sent on two men and water-camels ahead to Subaihiya wells to fill up every available water-skin as probably no more water until As- Safa 6 or 7 days hence. Owing to heavy dew last night could not get off until 9-30 A m., and loaded up skins, leaving at noon south-west for As«Safa which is said to be 41 hours hence Zaid very keen we should go due west to strike the 'jada' (main road) direct to As-Safa which he says starts from At-TowU a little west of Wara Hill, I don't agree, as I want to fix Thamila-ut-Turki, which, from my previous tour, round here, seems to be wrongly-placed on Knox's map, and Khalaf says it is almost in our track if we make a bee-line from Subaihiya for As-Safa. Found Thamila-ut-Tu.rki after nearly three hours' march to be a little off our road to left; it must be quite 10 miles south-east of the position Knox gives it, but I got bearings to Burgan and Wara and an approximate bearing to Grain Hill (invisible) which with careful dead reckoning should fix it tolerably accurately. From this Thamilat at which the wells had fallen in and there was no water we bore a little more to our right and eventually reached, at 4-10 P.M., the top of the ridge dividing Ash-Shag from the eastern drainage and camped after another J hour's march. Camels marching neither good nor bad. Zaid managed to lose the Shaikh's Hurr hawk ' Barkat ' the first time he put her up, but succeeded in getting one hubara with the Shihan which we used for completing 'Jumlah's' training. 2nd February. —Marched at 9-20 A.M., and soon sighted Fowaris Hill about south-south-east, Continued descending steadily into the Shigaig, after crossing which and rising a little over the ridge between this valley and Ash-Shag passed a little south of another of my previous camps. At this point the Shag is very difficult to define beyond that it lies between the ridge just mentioned and stops as soon as one reaches the bare gravel where the A1 Garaa waste begins. This we did at 1 -20 P M. Soon we had lost all marks and there was absolutely no track nor a vestige of anything by which to know direction except the sun. We were steering about south-west and my compass showed Khalaf held his course very steadily. The camels began to march better after leaving the ' arafij ' grazing of Ash-Shag, the Bedouin reason being that they are anxious to get on to the next grazing. We camped at 4-Q0 P.M., on the bare plain with not a scrap of life, animal or vegetable, visible to the horizon which was a dead level line all round giving exactly the effect of being at sea. Fortu nately we had carried some firewood with us and that eked out with camel- dung made the cooking-fire. 3rd February. —Marched at 8-45 keeping about the same direction with a shade less south in it. Halted a few minutes for the'^asr' prayer andthen on again, the camels marching well. Camped at 4-30 P.M., in the same desolate waste. The ground appears to have a very gentle rise the whole way from Ash-Shag and water should drain ofl: it in a south-east direction. Ath February. —Marched at g A.M., as according to Khalaf the distance between the ' arafij ' of Ash-Shag and the ' hamth ' grazing is 20 hours across AUGaraa at this point and we have done nearly 13 hours' good marching, baw first sign of life in distant troops of gazelle, making it certain we were not far off possible grazing. Both yesterday and to-day saw several mirages of the story-book type, one being a particularly beautiful one of a lake with trees and palms overhanging it and their reflections showing in the water. At 11 *45 A.M., came on a shallow green dell into which every camel s nose went down at once, whilst the men with many ejaculatory ' Thanks be to God , God is bountiful , etc., slid off their mounts and rushed to collect materials for a fire as soon as permission was given for coffee to celebrate the occasion. After a rest of three- quarters of an hour we started again for the edge of the '' hamth ' grazing now visible Reached it by l-io P .m., and camped so as to give the camels a chance of getting some thing into their bellies. The ' hamth ' here is the most uninviting -looking dired-up bush, but there was a certain amount of green herbage at the roots of the bushes which the camels made for greedily. Saw some s a n d- grouse flighting in the evening but much too high for a shot. Zaid successfully stalked a hare which his hungry Bedcuin eyes located lying up under a bush near our track. The camels have marched exceptionally well over the last two days' waste. zth February—UzxchzA at 9 a.m. and after an hour struck into the Tada' mentioned before. It is said to run quite straight from As-bafa to Khabra-ud Dawis and then to bend eastwards to make At-Towil whilst a branch from Khabra-ud-Dawish goes more or less straight on to Kuwait leaving the Manamsh Hills on its north. The ' Jada ' runs more southerly than our course hitherto and we followed it for the rest of the day all through hamth bushes until we camped at 4-20. Camels marching badly to-day because they^ are hungry and insist on grazing by the way. Ground still appears to be rising very slightly. 6ih February —Marched at 8-45 A. M. and soon found ground began to change, several dry water-courses crossing the road flowing from west to east. Was able to get bearings again as a few hills began to show up to south o* the track. At i2'^oP. m. began to descend into the basin in which the As-baia wells 'lie and at 1-45 P. M. got to Thaleh-uth-Thuleb, the highest hillock in the basin and overlooking the wells about a couple of miles further south-west. Pitched camp under another hillock about f mile nearer the wells, and sent off for' more water as what was left of the Subaihiya supply furnished a long anticipated bath. Marching of camels the last two days not at all good, bpent the afternoon taking bearings all round. One of the baggage camels added a ridiculous white baby to our numbers. The event was welcome as supplying fresh milk for the rest of the tour, though the infant will have to be carried tor two or three days. yth February. —Had intended to halt here a day but the grazing is scanty and the men fearful of possible raiders, for, though our ' rafiqs safe-guard us from any Aiman or Umtair bands, other very distant tribes from Central Arabia visit these wells. The wells are said to number about 20 and to average 25 fathoms in depth. They are nearly all stone-lined and are said to have been the work of the ancients. They lie in a basin which has steep gravelly clay cliffs of about 100 feet high on its northern edge, down which come ram-torrents from the table -land further to the north The ground is not so steep on the oDoosite (southern) side and the depression seems to dram away north-north east by a broad valley called Shaib-al-Faisal. We found the water m the wells quite yellow and rather fouled by recent rains having washed m camel and sheep droppings from the numerous adjacent camping places. It was fairly sweet and is said to be the best water between Kuwait and Zilfi, a not impossible fact considering there are only one or two other water.holes between As-bata and that place.After filling up all water-skins marched at 11. A. M. climbing out of the depression by a rather bad track on to the northern plateau, which after a short time turned out to carry any amount of the most succulent green fodder, ground herbage of various kinds, most of them in flower. One especially liked by the camels is called'' shigara and has a purple flower which when seen in large masses at some distance gives the appearance of heather. As camels were marching slow we decided to make a short day of it and halted at 1 -30 P. M. between two knolls with the (f jada ' (main road) from As-Safa to Hafar some distance away to oar left. Zaid got a couple of hubara to-day. 8th February, —Marched at 8-50 A.M. keeping through excellent grazing when at 10-15 A.M. a dust-cloud on the horizon showed up and was diagnosed as a party of horsemen obviously making for a raid on us. Camels were made to kneel as hurriedly as possible, each man got his rifle and ammunition and hurried off to adjacent hillocks taking cover in the most approved light infantry style, the cook remaining on guard over the camels with a gun and a supply of No. 5 shot cartridges! The attack had developed by this time and my glasses showed about 20 to 30 horsemen galloping at their best pace for us in a wide enveloping semi-circle. The men were told not to fire until the raiders were close as they might prove to be friends, but a few wild shots from the attackers started my camel men off and their shooting was execrable. It did not last very long for as the raiders got up to us and galloped through making for our camels, we heard their war-cry ' Haif, Haif, Al-Umtair, Al-Umtair'. Immediately my Bedouins heard this they waved their rifles and head-kerchiefs yelling l&lt; Al-Umtair, Al-Umtair, don't shootThe firing stopped then, but the raiders had made good their dash for the camels. It turned out that they were a party of the Al-Fugam Umtair under their Shaikh Haif and his brother Jafran who apologised profusely for their mistake and as no one had been hurt we foregath- eied round a fire and coffee was soon going round. Haif who had visited me in Kuwait explained he was on his way to raid the Ajman and had taken us for a party of them. He had with him, besides the 30 or so horsemen who got into us first, about 60 to 80 thalul-riders. We parted the best of friends with no harm done to either side, whilst I had gained the experience of a real Bedouin attack It was dashingly delivered and the way the attacking party gallops in at widely extended intervals accounts for the few casualties always reported in these raids. The thalul-riders support the horsemen and generally get up a few minutes after the horsemen have run into the camels to be raided. I am told they generally pay no more attention than they are forced to the dismounted defenders, their main object being to drive off the camels as soon as possible. These raiding parties travel very light, each man's food consisting of a few handfuls of dates and a few pieces of bread which is all he carries besides his arms and ammunition on his person or his mount. A few skins of water are carried for general use by some of the thalul-riders and there are no other baggage or spare animals. They can do, thus equipped, marches of 50 or more miles a day, raid their intended prey during the night and put another 50 miles between themselves and the scene of action before the following sunset. Any mount going lame or a man sick has to leave the party at once and make the best of his own way out of danger and back to his tribe's tents as best as can. The Bedouin say they can, in the winter season, go without water them selves three days and without food two days, but their mares cannot dispense with water for more than 30 hours. We resumed our march at 11-45 A. M. with the camels not marching well, and camped at 4 P. M. These Arabs were the first we had seen since leaving my first camp. gth February. —Marched at 8-45 A. M., veering a little to the left until we struck the ' Jada' between As-Safa and Hafar at 10-15, followed this through splendid grazing until at 2-30 P. M. we came to a small mound on the road called Masjid-ibn-Rashid, It is said to have been a rough pile made by Muhammad ar-Rashid in the days when he over-ran most of northern Arabia to mark the half way point between Hafar and As-Safa, which places are each 12 hours distant (loaded camels' pace). Continuing, we camped on the road at 4-30 P. M., tiiecamels going about fair. Passed large numbers of the various sections of the Umtair with their tents, herds and camels moving slowly eastward over the excellent grazing on the whole of this plateau. Heard report that some of the Malaiba Umtair were raided last night by Dhafir Bedouin. loth February. —Sent off Ghanaim with a post to Kuwait and hope he arrives all right. Marched at 9 A. M. keeping along the well-defined track until at 1 P. M we began to descend into the Falaij-al-Janubia which comes in from the south and drains into the basin of the Hafar wells it is abroad valley and about 50 feet below the surrounding plateau As Khalaf said we had got well on our way, we halted at 4 p.m., the camels having marched fairly well. Zaid lost the Shaikh's remaining hawk c: Shalwa Considerable excitement at numerous horse-tracks, fairly fresh, and obviously those of the raiding party we heard about yesterday. 1 ith February. —Marched at 9 A. M. and kept veering gradually more and more to the north following the Falaij bottom. Khalaf rather nervous about approaching the Hafar wells too close, so we camped an hour short of them in a convenient fold of the ground at 1 P M., and sent on Khalaf and another man to reconnoitre as we wanted water badly. They came back after an hour very much scared and with a report that they had seen a large body of raiders in possession of the wells, watering their animals. They said they had counted about 10 or a dozen horsemen and estimated the ' thaluls ' at a hundred ; the party were moving off east and were probably either Dhafir, Muntafik or Shammar. There was nothing to be done except lie low and hope we should not be seen. I had a look round later and decided it would be safer to march at sundown, take up our water in the dark and continue our road up A1 Batin by night, thus cutting in behind the raiders and getting away before they should return to water their horses. Accordingly the water-camels went on ahead while we struck camp, had a meal, and followed at 8 p M. It was pitch-dark with no moon to help, but after the camels had settled down and the men stopped chattering we got along all ri^ht; the camels' pad-feet in the soft sand made so little sound that 20 yards off it would have been almost impossible to hear our caravan. We reached the well agreed upon in an hjur to find no signs of the men sent on ahead or their beasts. This made things exceedingly awkward, for the wells are notoriously unsafe at night, that being the only time outlaws and those with unpaid blood-money due from them take their water. We had only two or three empty water-skins, the nearest water was two good marches away, and the 30 fathoms rope required for these wells with the rest of the skins was with the missing men. We couched the camels and three of us visted every well in the place with the bare result that water had been freshly spilled at one. The only solution seemed to be that the men must have got frightened at our delay and gone on ahead by our intended route up A1 Batin. Accordingly, we marched at 10 P.M., our, course being with the ' North Star in your left eye' as the Bedouin put it. It was too dark to read the compass very well and the Bedouins were nervous about striking a light giving us away. After about 20 minutes I was relieved to hear a whisper which proved to be Zaid looking for us What we had surmised had happened and he had the water-camels hidden a little way off. We continued our way up A1 Batin, the camels marching particularly well—because they could not see to graze was the Bedouins' reason. It was bittery cold and by 2 A.M. (of the 12th February) I decided we were far enough from the wells to be fairly safe^ so we bivouacked in the open without tents or a fire, with the camels parked to windward to keep off as much of the wind as possible, though we got the benefit of their powerful scent instead. y Up soon after dawn, rather damp with the dew, but after some coffee got off at 8 A.M. and marched for if hours, the camels going badly, and then camped for a rest. U is unfortunate I had to travel this part of Al Batin at night, as curiously enough Knox also did It at night, though in the reverse direction. I wanted to send back to try and pick up Mathoor, my post-sowar, who should hava reached Hafar yesterday or to-day, but the Bedouin considered the idea' rank foolishness and eventually i agreed that Mathoor would probably be able to look after himself well enough and if he came down to the wells might pick up our tracks and follow ; however, if he did not catch us up before Rigainor W6 meet him coming down thence, two of the Bedouins would return 3.s he must be waiting at Hafar according to my orders given in Kuwait. 13th February. —Marched at 10-15 along the eastern slope of A1 Batin which must be some 4 to 5 miles wide from bank to bank and perhaps 100 to 150 feet below the surrounding plateau. We passed Kasr-Belial, a mound only re- mainin or of what must have been only a small building with signs of a well and tank alongside, the latter apparently well-built with &lt;( juss ' mortar, the channels, etc.. being still plainly visible. The story of the place is that Belial was a slave of the old^time rulers of Basra who was placed in command of a post here to safe-guard the caravan route from Basra to Nejd. He dug the well and used to have a small garden which was irrigated from the tank by the well. 1 he story is not improbable, judging by the remains visible. Later, we passed the mounds of Ath-Tharaband, the knoll of A1 Ashar, and camped in the first of the nullah-like torrent-beds called Athariyat, which run down from the eastern plateau into the Batin, at 4*^5 P'M. the camels having marched fairly well. J4th February. —Marched at 8-45 A.M. and camels going fairly passed the Kharja mounds and soon after climbed out of Al Batin across a ravine or two reachino- the Ri^ai wells at 2-15. The wells lie in the bed of another ravine and are curious in having underground galleries connecting some of them. The water is excellent, but only obtainable in small quantities at a time and then only after good rains. ' We were met by Muhammad bin Aamir waiting for us with his post. We went on a bit east -north-east to U.e level of the plateau near Ummal Hamir, a shallow green depression, and camped at 3 P.M. Here we got the news of Shaikh Mubarak's collecting a force for a big raid and Zaid, his man, begged to be a.lowed to go to join him, saying that raiding with the Shaikh was 14 food from God ' for poor Bedouins. As he was not much use without his hawks, I let him o-o, usino- him to send a post into Kuwait. Two men also were told off to leave to-morrow morning for Hafar to bring up Mathoor whom we heard had been given refuge by Faisal -ud-Dawish, the head of the Umtair Shaikhs. 15th February, —Remained halted whilst two men went back for Mathoor. Took some more bearings and got through some letters- In afternoon Mandil, the young Shaikh of the Malaiba Umtair, called in on us with a small raiding party returning from an unsuccessiul effort against the Shammar. Passed the news with him until he left to rejoin his tents south of Mosannah. Some stray Bedouins met at the wells say that the large party we saw at Hafar were of the Anazah, with Saud bin Lami as their guide, and had been looting Awazim and Kuwait Araibdar, We were well out of the piace, it appears. 16th February —Still halted, but after dinner Math3or and the other two men returned, Mathoor having had an exciting time. He got to Hafar on the j 2th morning, and must have passed us in our night-march quite close, as he says he travelled that night for safety just to the east and clear of Al Batin. On arrival near the wells he was fired at by two men, but evaded them and met some of Faisal -ud-Dawish's followers who wanted to loot him on the spot as he was a Dhafiri without a ' rafiq' ; but he appealed to Faisal, with his post-bag and some soda-water bottles as his credentials and Faisal very magnanimously eave him shelter. On Faisal's departure Mathoor went down again to the wells and having no rope or water-skin managed, to exist two w hole days without a drop of w^ater to drink and only then broached a bottle of my soda. He had had to hide from the Anazah party which returned to the wells as we bad expect ed. He had hung about near the wells until my other two men found him and brought in his post safely, having incidentally proved himself a man of rather above average Bedouin courage. Decided to go on as soon as the water-skins could be filled, and so marched at 11-45 about north-north-east to get down into Al Batin again. V. e had some bad ground to cross called Shigaya and got into the bottom of the valley at 2 45 P.M. whence we kept more north-east and camped at 4 15 P.M. under a knoll called Thaleh-al-Obaid. Any number of sand-grouse in the valley and managed to bag a few for the pot.iSth February. —Marched at 8-50 and in two hours came on traces of ancient reservoirs called Gulban. These appear to have been well and solidly built though filled up and barely visible now ; found some greenish-glazed pottery chips round them quite unlike anything obtainable now in Kuwait cr amongst Bedouins and which appear to be old. Passed large camps of Soluba with numbers of mangy camels but splendid flocks of sheep. Good steady marching until 4 p. m. when we halted among a number of Breh Umtair tents. The Shaikh is away raiding and rejoices in the name of ' The father of the Long Mustachois'! igth February. —Bought some sheep for the larder and then sent off Ali bin Aamir with a post to Kuwait and orders to meet me on the Gaishaniya road with the return post. Marched at 9 a. m. about north-east follwing the A1 Batin which seems to be broadening out and getting gradually shallower. Passed some more traces of reservoirs about an hour before camping at 3-30 p. m., just beyond the opening in the eastern bank where the Shigat-al-Wasiya debouches into A1 Batin. Fairly good going. Clouds of sand-grouse all the way. One of the reservoirs we passed is said to have been excavated by the Dhafir tribes men some years ago to a depth of 20 fathoms in the hope of re-utilizing it. Water was not reached but the building was good solid stone set in mortar. 20th February. —Marched at 8-45 a. m. keeping a little more north than before, and sighted Jarishan Hill at 1 -15 p.m. Kept on through magnificent grazing and camped at 3-30 p. m. close to Jarishan hill and one of Knox's pre vious camps. Camels travelling well. 21st February. —Marched at 8-40 following the bottom of A1 Batin which is beginning almost to disappear. At 11-30 reached Halaiba with traces of old wells and a clump of stunted wild-plum trees, looking very dried«up and dead, but still the first thing in the shape of a tree seen in the whole of this trip. Quarter of an hour after came on a camp of Mubarak's nephews (the sons of the murder ed Muhammad bin Subah) whose home is in Zubair, but who were out here hawking. 1 hey complained that there was little sport this year owing to the excellent rains. Sent on the u hamla ' and stopped to an al fresco lunch with them, eaten sitting round in the common circle a 1' Arabe. Caught up the 41 hamla ' at 2-30 p m. who were heading too much towards Safwan. Altered course for Ar Ratk and got there by 4-15 p. m. and camped. Got good bear ings, but it is unfortunate having left the ' hamla ' as I shall not be able to be so certain about to-day's dead-reckoning. . Al Batin ends here. 22nd February —Marched east-south-east at 8-35 so as to leave Sanam hill on our left and make a bee-line for the Gishaniya wells. Passed several water-courses, but the ground is bare compared to the splendid grazing in Al Batin. Camped at 2-50 p.m. after some very good going. In sight of Sanam and with Safwan-fort due north. 23rd Marched at 8-50 and reached the Gishaniya wells in 2 hours, turned south then for some good grazing ground and camped after about half an hour. Ghanaim arrived in evening with post from Kuwait. 24th February. —Halted and enjoying a rest, though a number of evil-look ing Thukara, apparently the off-scourings of the river towns and allied to the Muntafik have their tents near us. A shot was fired at our tents yesterday in the afternoon, but we could not lay hands on the culprit. 25th February. —Marched at 8-25 and struck a bit south-west to make the high road between J ahara and Safwan which runs almost perfectly straight between the two places and not as shown on the map. Were sniped at for some time by Thukara who refused to be convinced by the waving of cloaks that we were peaca- ble travellers. Finally, had to go and threaten them with Mubarak's wrath before they would desist. As no one was hurt the fire was not worth returning. Looked like rain so camped at 4-5 p.m. on the main road close to the mounds called Hissu-ud-Thabi. Rain began soon after and kept up most of the night. 26th February. —Could not march, tents being soaked through but heard that Lyle of Gray, Mackenzie &amp; Co. in Basra, was camped a mile further on, returning from a visit to the Shaikh at Kuwait, Sent him a message to8 come and join me and halt a day. He did, and fortunately so ; we had rain most of the day. 2yth February. —Lyle went off towards Basra and I packed up shortly after for Jahara. Camels marched well and we got over the Mutlaa pass all right before dark, camping to the north of Jahara town. 28th February. —Made an early start for Kviwait going on ahead with the Bedouin. Heard Bin Saud had arrived in Kuwait and in the distance saw Shaikh Mubarak's army making for the rendezvous near Jahara. Got into Kuwait early in the afternoon and went to see the Shaikh in the evening where made the acquaintance of Abdul Aziz bin Saud, who expressed considerable surprise at the length and distance of my tour, and still more that I had enjoyed it. Kuwait; ^ W. H. I. SHAKESPEAR, Captain, loth March 1 gi0. ) Political Agent&gt; Kuwait, No. C.-15, dated Kuwait, the 4th April 1910. From —Captain W. H. I. Shakespear, Political Agent, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Busbire. In continuation of my letter No. 133, dated the 23rd March 1910, I have the honour to forward herewith a tracing showing my recent tour to As-Safa, Hafar and A1 Batin together with a note of the geographical information gained during the tour. 2. The information may be of use to the Intelligence Branch at Army Head- quarters r and perhaps also the Survey Department. Note on Captain Shakespear 1 s tour vi^, As-Safa, AUHafar, At-Batin and back to Kuwait. The accompanying observations and bearings were recorded during the tour with a trustworthy Prismatic Compass and read from it on a sieady tripod stand. The information collected on the route is, I think, fairly accurate as it was furnished by more than usually reliable Bedouins who knew the country well, and I checked it as often as possible. The accompanying map was plotted after return to headquarters, and may be inaccurate in the Longitude and Latitude lines which I had to take to the best of my ability from other maps of different scales. The rate of marching on which I depended for my dead-reckoning, a most important item in so featureless a country, was that given by my baggage-camels checked by daily notes of their rate of travel. It will be well to explain here that baggage-camels in Arabia march loose in a bunch and are not tethered nose and tail. Consequently they make better progress than the Indian beast. Their rate of travel is very steady and 1 have found in the course of two tours that three miles an hour as an average is very farly accurate. Bad ground may diminish this, and if the camels are in poor condition they will not do so much, especially if travelling in good succulent grazing country, for they graze on the march. On the other hand if they are in good condition, their stomachs full, or the desert bare of grazing, they will often do considerably more, even up to perhaps 3^ miles an hour. Trying to keep a dead-reckoning by ' thalul's ' (riding-camel's) pace when on the march 1 have found well-nigh impossible. Mv camels marched a deal better during the latter half of the tour owing to improvement in condition and being able to fill their bellies easily with a few hours' grazing as a result of an excellent ' rabia' ; moreover their loads became lighter daily. 3. It would have made my efforts at sketching this hitherto unsurveyed country of more value if I could have had with me a measuring perambulator of some type and a good pocket aneroid to show slight differences in heights. Onethat would read to 50 feet with a maximum of, say, 4 ,000 feet, would be most suitable,if such an article is available. I had a private one which reads up to 15,000 feet, but found it useless. 4. The accompanying map is traced from the original plotting and there may be inaccuracies due to tracing, but I trust not many. The red contour lines on it do not represent heights, but are an attempt to show the main rise and fall and drainage of the ground ; this applies also to the blue streams which only appear as such for a few hours after heavy rain. In my tour the points Burgan Hill and Wara Hill were known, in the sense that they have apparently been surveyed by a^qualified surveyor with theodolite or plane-table and their positions, taken from the Secret ' Map of Country round Kuwait, scale 1' to 4 miles', Register No. 914-S. of 1906 are assumed to be correct. I left these known points on the 1 st February and only again came on another fixed point (on the same ma P)) Jebel Sanam, on the 21st February after some 350 miles. My dead- reckoning would appear to have been fairly accurate as I closed on this hill to within a few miles. In my map I have not attempted to distribute the error, but left it in the march from Jarishan Hill to Ar Ratk. 5. The bearings given as ' invisible approximate ' were taken from the direc tion carefully pointed out by my Bedouin guides and are of interest merely to show how very good a reliable Bedouin's sense of direction really is, for they had no marks or tracks to go by other than the sun and stars. 6. The asterisked notes below deal in detail with certain points and refer to the corresponding red asterisks in the accompanying observations. ^1. Thamilat-ut-Turki. I think this place is shown incorrectly on Major Knox's map of his tour to Hafar in 1906. During a previous tour, in November I 9 0 9&gt; ^ w as led to suspect this, but was then unable to locate it accurately. On the present occasion I visited the spot and got bearings which put it at least 10 miles south-east of Knox's position. During his tour, Knox had hired Bedouins who do not^ appear to have known their country particularly well as some, I believe, lost their way on that occasion, and it would seem that Knox must really have been at a place called Thamilat-al-Erbid which he marked as Thamilat-ut-Turki. *2. Al-Hafar My bearings and dead-reckoning place these wells 16 miles east and a little north of Knox's position, but in view of the manner in which my route closes on a known point I am inclined to think my position is the more accurate. It would also make Knox's marches to and from Hafar more propable as at^ present they seem (from my experience) extraordinarily long, especially as his camels were hirelings and not particularly good beasts, *3. Bearing oj Bat in hollow.—\t will be seen that I differ a good deal as to the direction of A1 Batin near Hafar from Knox. Unfortunately I had to travel this portion at night, as was the case with Knox also, but our course was steadily kept. It was with s&lt; the North Star in your left eye,' as the Bedouin phrased it and two or three references to the compass showed this to give about 38' to 42 / as our direction. *4. l\igat Wells. —My position for these wells is about jo miles east and a little north of Knox s. For the reasons already given above under, 2,* Hafar wells, I am inclined to prefer mine again. *5, Skiggat-al»Wasiya.- —When fixing the debouchure of this valley I was informed in response to enc|uiry that it was the only valley debouching into A1 Batin fiom the east^ south of Jarishan hill, and found the information to be correct. In previous sketches I believe three such valleys are shown, as well as another position shewn in the secret map of the Intelligence Branch (D. sheet No. 30) scale 2 miles to inch, a blue print, and both would seem to be incorrect. . Jarishan Hill,—In the secret map (blue print) last quoted, Jarishan HiH is given as some 9 miles north-east of the position I show on my map, but I am inclined to think that half way between the two would be more correct, especially as I find^that the cross distances from Ar Ratk and from Jebel Sanam to Jarishan on Knox s original sketch are within 4 and 5 miles of those shown on mine and that from Halaiba is almost identical.10 *7. Ar Ratk ridge. —It was unfortunate that I had to leave my baggage- camels to go on by themselves from Halaiba for some time, for they went off the direct course to the east and I was unable also to gauge how they travelled as accurately as I would have wished. Consequently, I could only estimate 8 miles for the three hours that I was not with them. From the point, where I caught them up and got a bearing to Jebel Sanam, to my camp on Ar Ratk, occupied us i hour 40 minutes which should represent 5 miles, whereas it becomes 7 if south-east. Ar Ratk is accepted as fixed on the secret map 4 miles to the inch (Register No. 914 -S. of 1906). On the same assumption my day's march of 7^ hours also works out to 24 miles but is probably not more than 21 or 22. I have left the error in my map in the last portion of this day's march (February 21st). •8 and 9.

I have the honour to submit, for the information of the Government of India, No&gt; c-3o. dated 25th May 1910. a further report from the Political Agent, Koweit, regarding the progress of the feud existing between Sheikh Mubarak and Sheikh Sadun of the Muntafik.

Cox, C.S.I., CLE., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. In continuation of my letter No. C-14, dated the 30th March 1910, I have the honour to submit what is ascertainable regarding Sheikh Mubarak's inten tions against Sheikh Sa'adun. I have deferred reporting hitherto for the reason that no definite information could be gathered and indeed none is yet available, but my diaries will have shown what has happened from day to day. 2. So far as I can ascertain from several sources the position now is that Sheikh Mubarak does not intend to send a force against Sa'adun for some months. It is even hinted that there will be no expedition at all. He told me that it was to his interest to delay the expedition until heat becomes excessive for the reason that then most of the Muntafik will leave Sa'adun, being employed in their date-gardens, and besides as the tribes are principally horse-owners and not camel-owners they cannot move far in the hot weather for want of water. The Sheikh's people will be mounted almost exclusively on ' thaluls ' and there fore to some extent independent of water. The Sheikh is maintaining his force practically intact in the desert though the Umtair Bedouins have been permitted to leave for raiding on their own account. 3. The Sheikh said to me that he had asked Abdul Aziz Bin Saud not to remain longer because reports had been received that his long absence from Riadh was likely to bring his family into difficulties and though Bin Saud was loth to leave without having assisted in avenging Mubarak's defeat at Sheikh Sa'adun's hands he had been prevailed on to return and see to his own affairs in Riadh. The Sheikh at first insisted on all preparations for the season's pearling fleet being suspended, but eventually released the divers and nakhodas from duty in the field on the condition that their places were taken by substitutes. Though this affords some measure of relief it means a very heavy drain on the resources of this part of the community. 4. Grumbling is very general at the heavy expenditure which the expedition has already entailed on all classes and the small tradesmen and merchants, who being unable to afford substitutes, have to join the force in person, have little left; some I have heard have even been forced to sell part of their household property to meet demands from the men they have to support. • I have occasion ally, in a friendly way, tried to show the Sheikh that in keeping up an idle force for an indefinite period as he is doing at present, he is rapidly depleting the resources of his oeople. He replies that the hardship is one that does not come often and unless it is undergone occasionally in order that outside interference be suitably punished his prestige with the Bedouin would vanish, a contingency which would leave Koweit open to the raids of any large force of Bedouins and so all security would be destroyed. I have, of course, spoken to the Sheikh very cautiously in the matter without any suggestion in the way of bringing pressure to bear upon him. 5. Overtures for peace have been made by Sa'adun and the Thaffir Sheikhs, but the Sheikh assures me that they were not genuine and he could not think of accepting them without restitution of the property already lost.

He further added that the residence of a British Agent would be consented to in Katif,but at Hasa the Agent would have to be an Arab. /o. I refused to see the mail and replied, verbally tlirough ' r usuf Kano that thy overture should be submitted in writing my object being to obtain a letter xvhich might S&lt;Zu&lt;t possibly bt; of use in the future,and also to see how he wa.s a sincere in his proposals.

The Cairo paper ,4Z of the 19th June 1910 publishes a letter from its correspondent in Irak stating that in the battle of the combined forces of Shaikh Jabir bin Mubarak and Abdul Aziz bin Saud against Sadun Pasha the latter was victorious and took as booty some 2,000 Martini rifles, 2,000 camels, many swords and much other equipment and clothing. 3. This account, together with other information from Baghdad which gives over a hundred corpses as having been counted on the field, may, I think, be taken as a fairly accurate summary of the losses suffered in the engagement. 4. In conversation with Kuwait people the figures are received with surprise, but it is said that the full tale has never become known in the town owing to the defeated force having been kept out in the desert, and that these figures may possibly be fairly near the truth. 1007 F.

WITH reference to my despatches No. 17 of the 9th April and No. 23 of the 30th May, 1909, relative to Nejd affairs, I have the honour to report that the Eejaz newspaper of the 21st April, 1910, publishes a letter from the Acting Vali Mushir Abdullah Pasha to the Amir Ibn Rashid in the following sense :— ' We have received your letter and spoken with your emissary, and we have perceived with delight the fragrance of the valour of the lions of the desert of Arabia, and we have prayed for your preservation for the world of Islam seeing your devotion with the Khalifate and the Ottoman Government, and have derived much pleasure from the chastisement and correction which, as you have reported, you have inflicted on the rebellious Bedouins, as was the duty of all Moslems and faithful subjects according to the'text of Koran. Know that the purpose of our Sultan and his Government is to remove oppression, and spread justice and equality, and ensure the prosperity of the subjects, and I have been sent to perform the duty of governorship and to do the necessary service to you and to every Mussulman, and you shall know that the house of the Government is always open and the ear of compassion is ever ready here to attend to your cry, and the hand of justice will guard your rights, and you are all entrusted to my care by God, and therefore inform me of your Excellency's (Saadet) needs for the assurance of your security, and we will do at once what is needed with the help of God, and give our salutation to the members of your tribe and our brethren in the faith.' Nothing have been published in the newspapers of the circumstances or occasion of this letter, but 1 have learnt the following details :— Three or four months ago the young Amir with his uncles, who are his guardians, went on raid to the northward of Jauf and inflicted much loss on the Rowala tribe, which goes in the summer even as far north as Damascus. Rowala tribesmen afterwards in revenge invaded Jauf and took prisoner the Amir's Governor of Jauf, who is his maternal uncle Ali Subhan, and some other persons, and are now demanding the ransom, which it is said is 20,000Z. An emissary came from the Amir to Mecca to ask for the help or mediation of the Ottoman authorities, and the emissary has returned to Nejd with the above letter, the result of his mission being still unknown. Little can be heard here of Nejd affairs, but it appears that the expected downfall of Ibn Saood has not taken place, nor has anything further been heard here of the military ot other interference of the Ottoman Government in Nejd mentioned in the now extinct Mecca newspaper 'Shamsul Hakika,' as reported in my despatch No. 17 of 1909 above referred to. The Grand Shereef, according to a Mecca informant, has lately demanded of Ibn Saood a yearly due of 900^. for the district of Kasim, which has not been paid for over thirty years, and all the arrears for that time, to which demand no reply has been given, and the Grand Shereef is also said to have ordered the [2817 c?—2]m i A iirrmimrrrti Mrnem i inliabitants of Kasim to throw off their allegiance to Ibn Saood and become his, the Grand Shereef's, that is, the Ottoman Government's subjects, and it is thought probable that he, the Grand Shereef, will send a raid into Kasim. There are vague rumours of Ibn Saood being now engaged in alliance with the Sheikh of Koweit in a raid against Muntefik Arabs near Bussorah. I have, &amp;c. J. H. MONAHAN. N -{Confidential.)

With reference to the entries in this office diary for September and October relating to the excursion of the Sharif of Mecca into Najd, I have the honour to report the following information furnished to me by Shaikh Mubarak. 2. The Shaikh told me that in a recent letter received from Abdul Aziz bin Saud he was informed that the Sharif had retired to Najd without any fighting having taken place, but the circumstances of that retirement were vastly different from the current version. It appears that Abdul Aziz was particularly anxious as to the safety of his brother, Saud, who was a prisoner with the Sharif, and consequently it was Abdul Aziz bin Saud who made the first advances towards a settlement by begging that his brother might be released. Though Bin Saud was in far superior force the Sharif seems to have realized his anxiety on his brother's account and demanded a promise from Abdul Aziz that if he desired the release of Saud and himself to remain the ruler of Kasim and Southern Najd he must agree to pay $6,000 annually as tribute to the Sharif from the revenues of Kasim. Abdul Aziz wrote complying with the terms, Saud was accordingly released, and an exchange of presents followed, the Sharif retiring towards Mecca immediately after. 3. Shaikh Mubarak says that Abdul Aziz having recovered his brother addressed.another letter to the Sharif retracting his promise and asserting that it had been given by him under compulsion and was therefere void ; in this lettei Abdul Aziz also said that he had no quarrel with the Turkish Grovernment that the Arabs of Najd were poor Bedouin, who admitted the Sultan's sovereignty and were quite content with Abdul Aziz as their local governor. 4. With his letter to Shaikh Mubarak, Abdul Aziz also asked the Shaikh's advice as to complaining of the Sharif's inroad to the Turkish authorities in Basrah and Baghdad. Mubarak told me that he had replied to Abdul Aziz strongly deprecating such a course as most unadvisable for neither the Baghdad nor the Basrah Vali could do any more than write reports to Constantinople, and Abdul Aziz's complaint might open the door to further expeditions into Najd; that at present ' the door is shut, and if once opened, no matter how little, God knows when it may again be closed. ' 5. Shaikh Mubarak in discussing the incident much regretted that Abdul Aziz had been so foolish as to commit himself to paper regarding a tribute from Kasim (in itself probably unrealisable), as in view of the disparity of forces he could easily have achieved the release of his brother by threatening an advance on the Sharif, but he added Abdul Aziz though powerful amongst the Bedouin had no diplomacy and was very unsophisticated. 6. I attach a copy of a Constantinople telegram, which has a bearin 0, on this incident. 3Extract from Telegraphic columns of The Timse, London, 6th October 1910. SUBMISSION OF ARAB TRIBES.

When sending my telegram No. 88 on 28th instant, I had in my mind the parallel situation which existed in lyOl when Kuwait was apprehending an attack by c&lt; Ibn Eashid ' ; on which occasion the Government of India gave my predecessor discretion, if the situation indicated it, to have a warning intimation sent to the Shammar Chief (vide Foreign Department telegram of 12th April 1901). 4.

S. c&lt; Philomel ' after reaching Kuwait, before troubling the Government of India by telegram, and now the reassuring communication received this morning enables me to deal with the subject by post, for the present at all events. No. C.—l, dated Kuwait, the 18t.h January 1911 (Confidential). From C aptain W, H .I. S hakespbar , Political Agent, Kuwait, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to invite a reference to the various extracts in my last few weekly diaries reporting the movements of the raiders of Shaikh Saadoon of the Muntafik and Shaikh Mubarak, and in this connection to forward Arabic copies of certain correspondence with which the Shaikh of Kuwait has furnished me, and which I regret I am unable to have translated before the closing of the post. 2. The fighting foreshadowed in my diaries is a continuation of the „ ~ ^ quarrel which formed the subiect of Kuwait letter No. C.—12, dated the 9th March 1910. U , i • j - i J . „ c.—14, „ aoth „ „ the reports noted m the margin. ' ' ' Shaikh Mubarak for his part has not »* 59 C» ■' -l^tH u Jj IT IT* Tl T Kuwait diary, paragraph 137, of week ending 28th done much beyond keeping Up a Small September 1910. mobile force near Jahara as a safeguard, whilst during my recent short tour northwards I learned that Shaikh Saadoon was seriously contemplating an expedition which even included a possible attack on Kuwait itself. My authority for this is a conversation which I had on the 12th January with one of Saadoon's near relatives at Zubair who asked me very pointedly whether the British Government would interfere to support Mubarak in the event of the Muntifik actually attacking Jahara or Kuwait, though Saadoon was prepared to guarantee that no harm would result to the British representative or British life and property. I contented myself with an evasive answer to the effect that until the event occurred I was not in ai position to guess what action His Majesty's Government might or might not take, but I ventured to remind my questioner that it was not so very many years ago that the near approach to Kuwait of Ihn Eashid's forces and the reported presence of large bodies of Turkish troops near Safwan had brought British men-of-war into the harbour of Kuwait. I also explained that the British Government was largely concerned with Kuwait as a port to which much British trade found its way .and therefore I failed to see how they could disregard entirely a deliberate attempt on the town which must certainly affect those commercial interests. At the time I was not at all certain that these questions were not prompted by Turkish intrigue, and consequuntly only recalled past history leaving my interrogator to draw his own inferences. At the same time I counselled overtures of peace as being less damaging to both parties and the general advantages of a return to the friendly relations which up to a year ago always existed between Saadoon and Mubarak. 3. I saw the Shaikh yesterday and he informed me that the Vali of Basrah had addressed him on the subject of making peace with Saadoon and had offered himself as an intermediary. I enclose copies of the Vali's letter to the Shaikh and the Shaikh's reply. The latter purports to contain a history of the quarrel and though correct in the main facts is to some extent coloured as might be expected in an account given by one only of the parties. After the despatch of his reply the Shaikh received further news from his spies of Saadoon's advance with a large force to within striking distance of Jahara and he then despatched his telegram to the Vali of which also I have the honour to enclose a copy. It will be seen from these two papers that the Shaikh's attitude is correct and leaves no room for a plea that he is the aggressor. 4. This morning while I was drafting this letter the Shaikh came to see me and said that, though he suspected it before, he received last night reliable evidence from Baghdad that the whole of the present aggression by Saddoon had the countenance of His Excellency JSazim i'asha and is directed towards worrying Mubarak into a request for the intervention of the Turkish authorities in the quarrel and so forcing an acknowledgment of their right to settle his differences with others. After much pressing the Shaikh gave me the name of his informant, begging me to keep it secret. It will suffice here to note that this information came from a member of Nazim Pasha's Council in whom he reposes considerable trust, and who I know to be an old and valued friend of Shaikh Mubarak. The suggestion is supported by the fact that, though the Turkish authorities bave no cause to love the Muntafik tribes' from whom they have been unable for more than the last twenty years to extract any revenue either by force or by guile, Saadoon was for some time in the summer or autumn an honoured guest in Nazim Pasha's palace at Baghdad ; and further, his own relative told me in Zubair that Saadoon had settled his differences with the Turks during his visit to Baghdad, though at what price he did not say. 5. Eventually the Shaikh, who was undoubtedly anxious at the turn affairs have assumed, requested me to explain the position to you and if possible, endeavour to secure the presence of one of His Majesty's ships in'the harbour for a short time. The Shaikh went on to say that he would not have made such a request but for the information just received from Baghdad He was quite prepared to meet Saadoon and his people in the usual Arab way' and felt confident of defeating him signally, but it was evident now that Saadoon's boldness and the Basrah Vali's efforts to act as a mediator were all a part of the unending Turkish intrigue to induce him by pressure of one kind or another to open a door to Turkish intervention. He argues that the presence of a British warship in Kathama Bay would ensure the safety of Jahara and so of Kuwait by showing unmistakably that the British Government were aware of the intrigue and did not intend to permit Bedouin desert raids to take the form of assaults on coast towns. 6. Though the Shaikh affects confidence in his own men, I doubt whether he really feels it, and I am certain from outside information that they will be no match for even an interior number of the resolute Muntafik Arabs. Shaikh Mubarak's force consists of Nejada and townsmen who have no objections to rthe part of soldiers so long as that service means rations and a steady monthly wage without work, but for actual fighting they have no stomach. These are reinforced by large bands of Bedouin whose sole creed in fighting is plunder with safety and a whole skin and should they again encounter the Muntafik they will probably either desert in a bodv' to the other side or leave the field at the earliest opportunity on their mounts. On military grounds, therefore, I think the presence of a ship-of-war would certainly check Saadoon's aspirations to a raid on Jahara or Kuwait, and as soon as her arrival is reported to him it is probable Saadoon's tribesmen would be dismissed or betake themselves to raid ing further inland. 7. If the Shaikh's information regarding Turkish connivance in the raid is correct, and my own opinion is that it is so, the presence of a man-of-war will have a most salutary effect, and it is possible may even cause the Turkish Government to show its hand by a protest at her presence in Kathama Bay. 8. I need scarcely repeat bow nearly every one of Shaikh Mubarak's diffi culties has its origin in Turkish intrigue or how incidents trivial in themselves and even unconnected with him are utilised to provoke and worry him, whilst at the same time a panacea for all these ills is offered in his acknowledgment of Turkish sovereignty either by inscribing himself or his sons as Turkish subjects or by accepting a Turkish subsidy. The whole course of his relations with Turkish officials during the last few years shows that these intrigues will not cease until the Turkish Government is made to realise in the plainest manner that His Majesty's Government are aware of its aims and will wot permit them as disturbing their own relations with the Shaikh of Kuwait. On this srround alone I would solicit your support to the despatch of one of His Majesty's ships to Kuwait for a short time (if one can be spared), even if the possibility of a raid on the town did not exist, but such being the case the Shaikh's request becomes even more urgent, and I would beg that it may be considered as favourably as possible. Dated the 2ud Muharmm 1339 (4th January 1911). From—The Vali of the Province of Basrah, To—The Hobble Kaim Maka.m of Kuwait^ Shaikh Mubarak Pasha Al Subah. After presenting compliments let it not be hidden from you in view of the preparation made for the execution of a military engagement between you and Saadoon Pasha, I wrote to the latter to prevent the occurrence of such an inci dent and I have now received a reply in which he says that there is absolutely no truth in what has been rumoured about the preparation made by him and that he has not moved from his place up to now, but that when he proceeded to Baghdad to see His Excellency Nazim Pasha you despatched your son Jaber with your tribesmen who plundered from him about 4,000 camels and that he prays for their restoration and will, at all times, be pre pared for a reconciliation. In consideration of this his writing, it is under stood that he has a desire for peace and for the removal of difficulties. Now it is left to you to say if you have an idea and if you will agree to that, please let me know and I will endeavour in what is necessary or you may nominate a person in whom you have confidence to be on your behalf and let me know his name. As to Saadoon Pasha I will write to him also to choose a man on his behalf, and when the two men appear before me, I shall, God willing, understand the object of both the parties and endeavour to bring about peace and to remove these differences according to the usages of the tribesmen. I am waiting ^to hear) the result from you. And Salaams to you with God's peace and blessing. Translation of a telegram from Shaikh Mubarak of Kuwait to His Honour the Vali of Basrah, dated the 16th January 1911. After compliments. —Saadoon bad advised Your Honour that he had made no preparation and not moved from his place. I represented to you what was4 necessary in writing, and explained his falsehood. xTow he has reached th o south-west of Safwan, which is within my territory and approached my tribesmen. The state of the tribesmen is known to Your Honour; when antagonists approach (each other) it is inevitable that a collision will take place between them. When I heard of his coming near, I did, in obedience to Your Honour's orders, prevent my tribesmen from taking action against ^ ^ him and stopped them from approaching him, so that nothing whatever may take place before intimation reaches Your Honour and a reply is received. Now I have represented the circumstance to you, so that you may devise the necessary schemes for his returning to his own place. And if he remained in this place and anything took place I shall not be responssible. Dated the 15tli Muharrum 1329 (ITth January 1911). From— S haikh M ubarak A l S ubah , Ruler of Kuwait, To—His H onour H usain J elal B ey , Vali of Basrah. A.fter compliments. —After offering you my best respect I beg to state that I had the honour to receive your communication, dated 2nd Muharrum v &gt; 1329, No. 27, in which you suggested all what was good and advisable. I thank you for your good wishes and wise suggestions. You had stated that a reply has been received from Saadoon that he has not moved from his place and has not made the least preparation. It is incumbent on him to tell you the truth. As to what he has stated to you that he is in his place, Mayaah, and in the palace in the bush at Abughar j (I would state that) he is not in his place, but that he has told a lie. I regret that he who belongs to a noble family tells a lie, but I say that it is his characteristic which he developed. May God guide him to improve himself. It is necessary for him to avail himself of this happy time and of the honest Oovernment officials who endeavour in the inteiests of the JNation and the Government. May God help us in giving full satis faction to the officials of our Government. I, your sincere friend, will, God willing, follow a line of conduct which may be most peaceful and truthful, maintain justice and will not, inshallah, deal with the people except according to truth, justice and courtesy. Ihe family of whether Saadoon himself or all the sons of Eashid are dear to me up to now and will remain so afterwards, inshallah, because we were on the most cordial terms with them since ancient times, from the days of Rashid till that of his sons Mansoor Pasha and Nasir Pasha and their sons who are now alive. And Saadoon does not deny this and will also not deny my kindness to himself particularly. This his dealing with us does not hurt us, but will hurt his name and honour. The causes which created this ill-feeling will be represented to Your Honour according to justice and with proofs. In the first instance Osman-al-Eashid, a merchant of Kuwait, sent his employes to the tribesmen with rice, clothes and coffee to be sold to the tribesmen who are on the side of Nejd—from Shammur to Umtheir—and Osman's employes sold their goods and purchased camels and sheep and proceeded to our side. All the tribesmen, both Dhafir and others, were our friends; and Saadoon was like a son of mine in my estimation and was particularly good with me while he was not good to all the world. Ibn-i-Hallaf, the Shaikh of the Saeed tribesmen, seized from the employes of the said Osman Bashid the camels and sheep which they had bought together with the furnitures of their houses as well as the sheep belonging to the people of Jaharah. They informed that these belonged to the people of Kuwait and explained this fact to him. He asked them to bring him a letter from me as was the ordinary procedure with him and the other headmen of the tribesmen ; whenever there is any plundered ^ ^ property belonging to my subjects with them I write to them and they return the same. Ibn Hallaf and his tribesmen, the Saeed, all took refuge with Saadoon, because the Shaikh of the Dhafir, Hamoodas-Soweith had banished them and gave Saadoon a share of the camels and sheep belong ing to the people of Kuwait. I wrote to Ibn Hallaf to return them; but both he and Saadoon were inspired with covetousness. At the| sametime Saiyid Klialaf Naqibzadah happened to be with Saadoon on a visit because be is a great friend of his; and Saadoon started to proceed on a journey with the Saeeds and a party of the Muntafik herdsmen, and halted near my tribes men. My son Jaber happened to be with the tribesmen on an excursion to pass the spring and Saadoon warned the tribesmen who were with him saying that they have reached near the Kuwait tribesmen, and as they were thieves and would rob the furniture ot the houses, he wished to prevent them from doing so. Saiyid Khalaf left Saadoon and came to my son Jaber, whom he in formed of the statement of Saadoon. He (Jaber) thanked him, and he also received a letter from Saadoon containing expressions of friendship and kind regaids. A day after some one came to my son Jaber from tribesmen who were at a distance of 8 hours' journey, informing him that they were attacked by Saadoon and plundered. On learning this Jaber told Saiyid Khalaf—' How is this were these messages from Saadoon a trick by which we were duped through you? We will have to go to him and recover the loot from himSaiyid Khalaf assured him that he himself would return and demand the plundered property from him. When Saiyid Khalaf met Saadoon he (the Saiyid) told him that he (Saadoon) acted very badly and that he (Saadoon) had both deceived him and them, that he should now return the loot otherwise it would be recovered forcibly. He replied—' It does not matter, the plundered persons should come to me and I will return them (their property; ,, . My sou Jaber sent the plundered persons and they received somethinar which is not worth mentioning in comparison to what had been robbed. Friendly correspondence continued between me and Saadoon for the restoration of our plundered pro perty which remained with him, and the banishment of the Saeeds or the return of the plundered property which was with them. Saadoon was inspired with the baseness which is a characteristic of his and we were waiting for the Saeeds to separate from Saadoon; otherwise as regards Saado an andall Saadoon's tribesmen we shall, God williog, not agree that the least thing should be done by us against them and we will not oppose them purposely at present and in future. Mv son Jaber and Abdul Aziz-al-Saood learnt that on his return Saadoon was plun dered by the Ibn Hazzall and his tribesmen of Anezah when he attacked them and that he returned and went to his palace at Abughar and that the Saeeds separated from him. They, Jaber and Abdul Aziz Saood, availed themselves of this opportunity and when they reached near the Arabs they were met at daybreak by their own spies who informed them that the Arabs were Bedouin herdsmen and that there was a tent with them, which, as they had understood belonged to Saadoon. The spies also stated that according to what they saw there was Saadoon with the Arabs. They (Jaber and Abdul Aziz) abstained from attacking the Arabs in the morning owing to the fact that Siadoon was with them and waited till sunrise. They sent off certain horsemen to fire at the Arabs in order that they may attract a horseman from Saadoon's party and they may warn him. They pitched their tents and left their camels and horses to graze and they did not take the offensive by way of evincing some politeness Seeing this negligence on their pa-t Saadoon collected the horsemen of Adh Dhatir who were with him as well as the mounted herdsmen of Muntafik attacked their animals and plundered them in the pastures. This is the fact of this case, and I have truthfully represented to you what has happened. Now God willing, I will take no action against Saadoon but against the tribesmen who adopted the path of villainy and who are not from amongst his dependents the Muntafik. Whenever we find any opportunity we will punish him for the sake of the security of the roads and of the persons who carry on business from Khamisiyah to Zubair, Kuwait and A1 Hasa. Now in compliance with your command, I will make no preparation against Saadoon, and so lone as he is remaining with the bandits, 1 will avoid them until he succeeds in Se parating from them. It is incumbent on him to abide by Your Honour's commands and deal with you honestly. According to what he had mentioned to Your Honour he had not left his place, but he has now halted in our territories and awaits an opportunity to attack my tribesmen. His place is Al Mayaah in the district of Muntatik, and his palace is in the bush at Abu^har.6 He should return to his place in the same way as he advised Your Honour ' that he was in his place and has not moved therefrom'. The Mudtafik tribeamen, who are herdsmen and who leave Gharraf, Hartha and Basra li itself for Shamiyah with the purpose of grazing their animals have been deceived by him and have been forcibly collected by him in order that he may support himself by them. He has deceived them that they would be plundered if they separate. They have been safe all these years and we are guarding them and they were not the victims of the tribesmen from the first. A month and a half ago, I wrote to jS T asir-al-Aseimi, who is a resident of Zubair and to whom the herdsmen refer for the satisfaction of their requirments, that he should inform them that they are safe to go to their former habitats and disperse for the purpose of ieeding their animals and that I shall have nothing with Saadoon except what is good ; but that what he did to us did not hurt us but injure himself and his name. As to Saadoon's situation and what he does there is no need for me to represent them to you as Your Honour will learn (them) from official archives With regard to Saadoon's claim for the camels of the Dhafir tribesmen which were plundered by the Shaikh of the Umtheir tribesmen and his companions, this is a false argument. Eirstly, the Umtheir and Hhafir were on these terms from ancient time and so were the other tribes men. Further the Dhafir and Umtheir are united tribesmen and under their Amirs and are not connected with us or with Saadoon. Now as regards above-mentioned plundered property which he undertook to restore in a friendly way he should, according to the usage of the Arabs, give it up if he wishes to efface his disgrace and be free from this shame and he should remain with me on the old terms. But if he is actuated by meanness, we are able to do without the property and this fact will remain in the memory of the Arabs and he will be isolated from us. As to Your Honour's order that I should nominate some one on my behalf, I have (now) represented to you the facts and choose your own justice so that Saadoon may not cause mischief in this side. I have addressed you in order to explain the circumstances and hope that your kind attention will continue. In any case, order and decision will rest with Your Honour.

WITH reference to my despatcli No. c92 of the 7th instant, I have the hononr to forward herewith a despatch from His Majesty's Consul at Bussorah 26 C37 ?fD27 relative to the inquiries made, under orders from the Saltan, by Veli Pasha into the conduct of Mukhlis Pasha, the late Vali of Bussorah, and the causes of his dismissal. I have, etc., N. E. O'CONOR. Inclosure in No. 1. Consul Crow to Sir N. 0'Conor. (No. 36. Confidential.) Sir, Bussorah^ May 29, 1906, VELI PASHA, a Liwa and Aide-de-camp to the Sultan, has been sent here from Baghdad to inquire into the conduct of the late Vali, Mukhlis Pasha, principally with reference to the recent fighting in Mountifik, al)Out which very strange and discreditable rumours are current, and also in regard to his charges against Suleiman Pasha, Mohammad Pasha Daiihestani, and Eakhri Pasha, whom he accuses of improper dealings with Gadban, Chief of the Beni Lam, alleging that they gave the latter military control of the Persian frontier from Khanikin to Mohammerah, and appointed him ' Commander ' on the border. According to inquiries made by Veli Pasha, I am informed that the Vali's action in Mountifik was inspired solely by the desire to crush Sadun aud oust him from his lands at Suk-el-Shiyakh, where he had been permitted by the Government to settle last year. Falih Pasha, a cousin of Sadun, supported the Vali hoping to get his cousin's lands. Last year Sadun was expelled by armed force. The Vali pursued him, but, through lack of cavalry, was unable to G :et in touch with him. He returned to Bussorah for Ramazan, leaving Palih Pasha in possession of the land. The ostensible pretext for the Mountifik expedition was to recover arrears of taxes—£T. 359,000—due to Government. It is said they claim £ T. 112,000 from Suk-el-Shiyukh alone. The Arabs contend that their crops were assessed at too high a value by the local officials, and that the basis of taxation is therefore unfair. They have refused to pay anything for the last three years, and have staved off pressure by making large presents to officials. The Vali, who is exceedingly vindictive and obs tinate, would brook no interference in prosecutirig his schemes against Sadun. The authorities at Bagdad appear to have disapproved of his action, and Mukh lis Pasha having announced his intention of returning to Mountifik after Hamazan to capture Sadun, it was thought politic to have recourse to milder measures, and he was instructed not to proceed there. Sadun was in direct communication with Constantinople, and his representations as to the validity of his title to the land in dispute seem to have commended themselves to the Palace and to have received support. It is interesting to note that in the official data collected by Veli Pasha, the Vali is stated to have reported that Sadun was supported in his pretensions by the English. It was at this juncture that the troubles occurred at Amara over leasing the Sultan's lands, and Mukhlis Pasha was dispatched there to effect a settle ment between the Seniye Department and the civil authorities, and to turn out Gadban, Sheikh of Beni Lam, from Kumeid belonging to the Imperial domain lands. The circumstances attending the dispute were reported to Your Excel lency in my despatch No. 12 of the fith March last. Gadban seems inclined to resist with all the force at his disposal, and his resources are not inconsiderable. Eighting broke out again in Mountifik in March, as reported in my despatch No. 11 of the 5th March, the immediate cause, according to Veli Pasha's inquiry and my information also, being the murder of a member of the El Hacham tribe by Ashirets dependent on Ealih Pasha near Suk-el-Shiyukh. In order to take their revenge the El Hacham surrounded the town, and serious disturbances occurred, resulting in loss of life on both sides as already reported. The Mutessarif of Amara was despatched to Suk-el-Shiyukh, but failed to restore&lt;«. A f P j 0 v t order, and in April the Vali himself was directed to proceed there with a consi derable force. The official reports state that hehnd six battalions of infantry and four field guns. The effective of the battalion here is about 3')0 men. He also sent to Bussorah for the band. His Excellency's account of what occurred and his subsequent discomfiture were reported to your Excellency in my despatch No. 29 of the 12th May. The version of the affair obtained by Veli Pasha is somewhat different, and is as follows:—• On the night of the Vali's arrival at Suk-el-Shiyukh the Arabs, reinforced, I understand, by Sadun, attacked the town in force and poured in volleys all night. Twenty-four soldiers were killed and many wounded, but the Vali kept indoors. On the following day he marched out with his six battalions and four guns, accompanied by a large body of Arabs, and was surprised by an ambush. The Vali bolted when the fighting began, and took refuge on the &lt;{ Alus,' the river gun-boat in which he travelled from Amara. The debacle seems to have been general. Most of the troops fled. In one battalion there remained only eighty-four men. One gun was captured by the Arabs, but it was subsequently returned by means of friendly representations to the Turkish authorities. Sixty men were killed and many wounded, and the Arabs pursued the Vali to the water's edge. They were dispersed by the captain of the 'Alus,' who trained tht^ ship's solitary gun on the crowd and opened fire. The Merkez Commandant of Suk-el-Shiyukh having reported to the military authorities at Bagdad that troops were throwing away their rifles and that the Vali had fled, Mukhlis Pasha was immediately superseded and ordered to proceed to Stamboul. The second matter which forms the subject of Veli Pasha's investigation arises out of the quarrel between Suleiman Pasha, Commander of the 6th Army Corps at Bagdad, and Mukhlis Pasha The enmity between th ^m dates, I am told, from the time when Mukhlis Pasha commanded the gendarmerie atSalo- nica and Suleiman Pasha was inspector of railways there. On Suleiman Pasha's appointment to Bag !ad he applied to the Bussorah Vilayet to pay him his salary^ As Commander of the 6th Army Corps his request is not unusual. The Vali declined, and no money was forthcoming up to the date of his depar ture. The Vali claimed the right of acting independently. There was much confusion owing to the issue of contradictory orders from the two military centres., Hamid Pasha, who proceeded to Mountifik by the orders of Suleiman Pasha, was taken to task by the Vali for going there without his leave, and on applying to the Vali of Bussorah to victual his men was refused. He asked per mission from Bussorah to leave his appointment as Director of the Seniye Department at Amara, and w T as told to get his instructions from the authorities who had sent him there. This conflict of military jurisdiction, led to a lamentable w^ant of cohesion in the arrangements for the Mountifik expedition. Orders were subsequently sent to Suleiman Pasha not to interfere with the Bussorah Vilayet. In the course of the negotiations at Araara, Gadban, Chief of the Beni Lam, showed the Vali a letter which he had received from Mohammed Pasha Daghestani, asking him to furnish any information of interest to the Govern ment on the frontier-line from Khanikin to Mohammerah and to keep an eye on those districts, as there were no Turkish military posts there. The writer stated that any good service on his part would be rewarded by Government. The Vali impounded the letter, and telegraphed to Constantinople charging Mohammed Pasha and the Bagdad military authorities with interference in his affairs, and accusing them of carrying on under-hand dealings with a rebellious tribesman. The Vali even stated that Gadban had been appointed Military Commander of the Persian frontier by Mohammed Pasha, and declared that his own attempts to settle the land dispute had been neutralized by the promises of reward held out to Gadban. The Bagdad authorities were interpellated, but denied the charge, stating that the Vali was misinformed. Shortly after this Gadban received another letter signed by Suleiman Pasha, Eakhri Pasha, and Mohammed Pasha Daghestani, thanking him for services rendered on the frontier, and again asking him to watch the interests of the 28Government in that quarter. The letter was brought to the Yali, who tele graphed, I am informed, in a paroxysm of rage to Constantinople denouncing the signatories of the letter as rogues, rascals, and traitors to their country, adding that he had written evidence of their guilt. The Vali's violence frightened his Secretary, who begged to the excused from dispatching such a message to the Palace. Veli Pasha has been commissioned to examine the letter, which are said not to justify the Vali's denunciation. Mukhlis Pasha's vindictive temperament and his obstinacy evidently carried him away, and finally led to his disgrace. The brutal manner in whicli wounded prisoners, who attacked him in the town gaol last year, were beaten in front of his house, is still fresh in our recollection. He was violent and bigoted, ignorant of administrative matters, and devoid of patience or inclina tion to understand them. His favourite argument was the Circassian riding whipj which he wore in his boot, and which he is said to have used with efiect at more than one sitting of the Administrative Council when his wishes were opposed. He drank heavily at night, and bullied his subordinates. His man ners w r ere rustic, and he made himself as difficult of access as possible. On the other hand, he took no bribes, and was generally honest in his dealings, though he omitted to pay rent for bis house. He took a keen interest in public works, built fine barracks in the Magam, and a depot for the gendarmerie in Bussorah with the aid of public subscription. He began several roads, and tried to im prove the town to the best of his ability. As long as he was in residence his masterful presence acted as a strong deterrent from lawlessness, and the town was quiet. When he absented himself at Amara disorder set in again. ^ He seems more fitted for some executive post in the gendarmerie than for adminis tering a vilayet. Like most Turks, he was a sad boaster, and professed himself to be animated by the best intentions. I have, &amp;c., P. E.

I have, etc., N. R. O'CONOR. M. Crow to Sir N. O'Conor. Basra, 1S t 0 gg 9th June 1906. Sir, With reference to my telegram of yesterday, No. 46, 1 have the honour to report that the attack on the native house in the neighbourhood of this 290000 Consulate, partly occupied by Joseph Pollock, a Christian native of Umballa, was of a particularly daring character. The house is situated in narrow lane about 250 yards behind tlie Consulate, next door to the residence of a Turkish Naval Officer, and almost faces the house and dispensary of Dr. Worrall of the American Mission. At the end of the lane, some 80 yards distant, is the Turkish Naval arsenal where a guard of some 25 marines is stationed. The attack began about 1 a m „ on the morning of 8th instant by a heavy fusilade, which lasted several minutes. There was a short interval followed again by a succession of heavy volleys, and then desultory firing at intervals. The shooting was in. such close proximity to the Consulate that the air on the roof where 1 was sleeping was impregnated with the smell of powder and the firing was unpleasantly near. The occupants of Messrs. Strick's premises, a little lower down the river, turned out with their armed watchmen iu anticipation of an attack. I am informed that the robbers were about 15 in number; the arms used were apparently Martini rifles. The firing was directed rather with a view to terrify the occupants of the besieged house and the neighbourhood than to kill. But a native was wounded on the roof and the British Indian subject was dragged with his wife from their beds, and beaten and wounded with sword cuts on the head and bands. The house was looted. A native Christian woman Shamata, who was a joint tenant was supposed to have had money on the premises to pay for some property which she had lately bought. The Turkish naval guard close by never turned out at all and gave no assistance whatever. Had they done so it would have been easy to cut off the robbers' retreat. Their failure to give help gives rise to strong suspicion that they were in collusion with the thieves. Lawlessness in the town is greatly on the increase I have warned the Acting Val of the necessity of adopting extraordinary measures for the protec tion of life and property at night in the outskirts, and asked him to institute an enquiry as to why the naval station at the Arsenal gave no help in the present case. 'l have suggested that armed patrol should circulate at night and that more effective measures should be taken by the authorities to check the existing lawlessness. I have, etc., F. E. CEOW.

Constantinople, 27tJi June 1906, No. Ul. Sir, With reference to my despatch No. 439 of the 26th instant, I have the honour to forward herewith a despatch from His Majesty s Acting Consul General at Bagdad respecting the attack by Arabs on Messrs. Lynch s steamers, and the generally unsatisfactory state of the Bagdad Vilayet. I have, etc,, , N. E. O'CONOR. 80 C377PD31 Major Ramsay to Sir N, 0' Conor. Bagdad , Nos. 486-45. 2Sth May 1906. Sir, In oontinuation of my despatch Nos. 461—42, dated 21st May 1906, report ing an attempt by Arabs to board the British steamer Mejidieh on 12th May, some miles above the junction of the Tigris and Euphrates, I have the honour to report the following facts for Your Excellency's information. 2. On 26th May I received information from the manager of the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company that the Turkish steamers Burhania and Mosul which had left Bagdad on the 20th and 23rd May respectively had been fired at, and that in the case of the Mosul o passengers had been killed. I went to see Mejid Pasha who is at present in charge of both the Bagdad and the Basra Vilayets I told him what I had heard and also mentioned that I had heard that on llth May some bales of goods had been stolen from the Turkish steamer Burhania. Before I went to see the Wiili I had been told that he had received a complaint from the he-id of the Saniya Department at Bagdad about the attacks on the steamers and that the officials of the Saniya Department at Amara considered that the property of the Department at Amara was in danger of being injured by the Arabs. However Mejid Pasha assured me that I was his first informant and promised that he would make inquiries from Basra. I suggested that he might get reply that the officials at Basra were without information and asked him to apply for information to the local officials and also to the officials of the Saniya Department. He promised to do so, and I said that until I heard from him that the river was safe, I should delay the departure of the British steamer from Basra. I was then preparing to take my leave when the Vali asked me to wait a minute as he had sent over to the Saniya Department's Office for information. Shortly after an official came in with a report to say that the steamers of the Saniya had, in fact, been attacked. On the morning o! the 27th I heard that some local arrangements had been made at Basra for the safety of the British Mail Steamer, and that she had started on the 26th. T have written to the Yali to-day recapitulating the conversation, and I have informed him that I shall presume that there is no reason to delay the departure of the British steamer from Bagdad unless I hear from him to the contrary. 3. The condition of affairs in this Vilayet is far from satisfactory. There is no security of life or property in the town of Bagdad, where murders and robberies are of daily occurrence. Mr, Crow's reports will have informed Your Excellency of the conditions prevailing at Suk-ul-Shiyukh and I have just received information from the Vice-Consul at Karballa that there has been fighting between the Arab tribes at Najaf for four days, in the course of which the big Bazaar there has been plundered and a number of persons killed. 4. Majid Pasha appears to me to thoroughly deserve the character which Your Excellency gave him in your very Contidential letter of 9th November 1905. He appears to know nothing, or if he does know, he makes a point of hiding his knowledge For example, when he recently received instructions from Constantinople to release the safety matches belonging to Messrs. Blockey Cree and Co., he denied having received the telegram; a few minutes later my dragoman saw it in his office. On the present occasion I have no doubt that he had received reports of the attacks on the steamers before he saw me. 6 J have not heard what has brought about a fresh crisis with the Arabs inhabiting the banks of the Tigris, but I will try to find out for Your Excel lency's information. In the meantime I am informing Mr. Consul Crow thatmrnmt&amp;i J i : - ■ S) V if he wishes it (1) I will put the R. I. M. S. Comet ' at his disposal, and (2) he may make use of Mr. Gaskin, who will shortly reach Basra on his way to join his new appointment at Bagdad. I have, etc., J.

Grave fears entertained safety. Mejidieh, Cannot obtain any further information. Local Turkish Government helpless. 'We urge you to continue pressure avoid suspension service.' The S. S. Mejidieh is one of the steamers of this Company's river flotilla carrying His Britannic Majesty's mails, passengers, and cargo from Bagdad to Basra, and we believe should have been due in Basra on the 7th instant. She carries three officers and three engineers all British subjects, and a native crew. Amarah is a la*rge town on Basra. the Tigris some 36 hours run from A previous message received this morning from Bagdad agents informed us that the S 0 S. Barhanieh a steamer of the Turkish Senieh Administration was fired upon by an Arab tribe on the 6th instant. In my letters of the 31st May and 6th June I informed you of previous attacks on our steamers. Our Agent in Bagdad advises us that he wrote on the 8th June to Major Ramsay as follows :— ' If the local authorities are not capable of keeping the peace without coming to terms with the belligerent Arabs, as His Excellency the Vali's instructions to Amarah indicate, we have no guarantee that similar attacks on our steamers will not be arranged by Arabs having differences among themselves or with the local officials, with the object of embarrassing the Turkish Government. 'We have no hesitation in stating that these disturbances are mainly due to the weakness of the local authorities, and unless the Central Government strengthen the guard along the river banks, and take energetic measures to punish the ringleaders of the recent attacks, we may expect to see other attacks immediately any difficulties arise among the Arabs.' I am instructed to express the hope that you will send immediate instruc tions to His Excellency the Ambassador at Constantinople and to His Britannic Majesty Consuls at Basra and Baghdad to take urgent and effectual measures to secure protection of our interests. In view of the obvious helplessness of the 32 V33 Turkish local aut]iorities J we would suggest that a guard of Indian troops on each of our mail steamers would proteot them from these attacks.

As regards your suggestion that a guard of Indian troops might be placed on board your mail steamers His Excellency is of opinion th at a measure of this nature might give rise to serious complications and be held to relieve the Turkish authorities of their responsibilities in regard to the protection of the river traffic without being in itself effective.

No reply had been received to this telegram when Mr. Crow wrote. No. 38, dated the 2lst January 1907. From— Major S. Gr. Knox , I. A., Political Agent, Koweit, To— Major P. Z. Cox, C.I .E., Political Resident ia the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to inform you tint one Nasir, a relation of the Amir of Hail, has arrived at Koweit and that SheikU Mubarak informs me that he has been sent by Bin Rashid in order to inform the Sheikh of Koweit of all that has occurred recently at Hail and notably of the murder of Metaab Bin Abdul Azaz Bin Rashid, the late Amir of Hail, and his two brothers. 2. According to Sheikh Mubarak, Nasir has brought letters in which Sultan practically puts hipaself at Sheikh Mubarak's disposal, is ready to listen to all his advice, and hopes for his friendship and protection. The letters may not be all that Sheikh Mubarelc describes th^m to be aid, even if they are, are probably only half sincere, but the fact that Sultan has, at once, sent a near relative to inform the Sheikh is of significance, as showing how far Mubarak's influence extends. 3. The Sheikh states that there is no lineal descendan t left of Abdullah Bin Rashid, and that, of the sons of Hamood Bin Obeid, only three are left, as all the others were gradually killed off during the recent troubles and fighting between Bin Rashid and Bin Saood. 4. The three sons referred to are Sultan, who has now assumed the title of Amir, and Saood and Eaisul. Apparently it was Sultan who is responsible for the murder of the young sons of th^ Amir Abdul Aziz. The s!ory, as received in Koweit, goes that the young boys were out hawking and Sultan came out and joined them. He had consulted his father, Hamood, who endeavoured in vain to dissuade him from his design. He left a slave with the two younger boys with instructions to kill them, as soon as he heard a shot fired, de himself rode out with Metaab who had no suspicion of the crime intended and was easily shot by the traitor from behind. The two little boys were then murdered by the slave. It is surmised in Koweifc that Sultan had some previous understanding with Bin Saood. 5. The Sheikh is of the opinion that all this tends to strengthen Bin Saood's position and he says that the latter will probably now take Hail. He has told me that he recently met the Wali of Basrah who was very much afraid that Bin Saood would go over to the English, Mubarak says that he reassured him and told him that the English do not want Nejd. The Sheikh says too that it is interesting to see the change of tone in the correspondence r &gt;of tlie Turkish authorities with Bin Saood. At first, they hardly replied to his letteis and now they are excessively civil to him and exhort him incessantly to keep foreigners at a distant.' It is impossible to put on paper the gusto with which the Sheikh repeated this phrase to me, but, with the mischievous Arab nature, he seemed thoroughly to enjoy the spectacle of his lor dsand masters, the Ottoman authorities imploring their turbulent vassal to keep ' those devils out.'

The correspondence relates to the overtures made by and on behalf of Abdul Aziz Bin Saood, the Wahabi Chief, with a view to the establishment of a closer connection between himself and the British Government. Major Cox, our Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, desires to be in a position to give a definite answer to these overtures, and has recommended in his letter No. 2181, dated the 16th September 1906, that we should take the present opportunity to come to terms with the Wahabi Chief, on the following grounds : — (1) that overtures have been made at various times by Bin Saood himself, and by Sheikh Jasim-bin-Thani and Sheikh Mubarak on Bin Saood's behalf, with a view to securing for the latter some measure of British protection, and that if we neglect these overtures. Bin Saood and his following may regard us with hostility; (2) that if a friendly understanding were to exist between the British Government and Bin Saood, both the Sultan of Maskat and the Trucial Chiefs would be fortified by the knowledge that any attempt on the part of the Wahabi to make a descent upon Oman would involve a preliminary rupture between him and the British Government; (2) that if Bin Saood were our friend he would be able to assist us in suppressing piracies in the northern part of the Gulf; (4) that such a friendly understanding would facilitate Major Cox 's dealings with the Trucial Chiefs and would render it possible for our officers to make occasional tours in the Nejd country; (5) that the Arabs of Central Arabia, apparently driven to desperation by Turkish interference, seem disposed to make common cause to throw off the yoke and are apparently trying to secure the support of the Sheikh of Koweit and even of the Sheikh of Muhammerah.* Realising, however, that they are not strong enough to stand alone, they see the necessity of enlisting the support of a Christian Power, and if we do not respond, they may approach some other Power. • Vide enclosurctj Nos. 4 and 5 and Mr. Consul McDouall's letters, dated 13th and 17tb October 1906 (annexures to enclosure ISo. 9).2 3. Proposals have 'been made on previous occasions for British interven tion in the affairs of Nejd, but it has been decided on each occasion that it • GoTernment of Indis despatch No. 69 (Secret), Would be inexpedient to incur the diffi- dated the 24th March 1904. culties and embarrassments involved. When in IVIarch 1904, proposals were made* for adopting a course which might lead to closer relations with the Saood family, your predecessor decidedf that it was inadvisable that His Majesty's tJ Mth a S uo4 de ' P ' tcb N °'' (Sec ' it) ' d ' &lt;!&lt;i Government should be committed to any course of action which would appear to encourage that family or which could be represented by the Turkish Govern ment as a breach of the understanding between the two Governments for ^ , o « ^ ^ the maintenance of the status quo in J Vide letter from Sir N. O Conor to the Marquess _ T . , , , i j •f Lansdowue, No. 129, dated the 26th Februarj On Llie Other lianci, it WaS 1904 - recognised^ as very important that the British Government should be in a position to decide as to the policy to be followed in case of a serious revolutionary outbreak in Nejd and the cessation of Ottoman rule in El Hasa. Your predecessor therefore hinted that, in the event of an alteration of conditions in Nejd in the above-mentioned direction, he might be prepared to consider further a proposal for sending a British officer to Riadh on a mission of enquiry. 4. In May 1904, on hearing that the Turks were collecting troops § Teleirram to His Majesty's Secretary of State to assist Bin Basllid, the Goveinment for India, dated the 29th May 1904, (J f India suggested§ to His Majesty's Government that representations might be made by Sir N. O'Conor to the Porte in order to prevent this. It was urged that our interests in Eastern and Southern Arabia were such that we could not view with indifference intervention on behalf (f one of the parties contending for power in Nejd, and that our prestige at Koweit must suffer materially if we permitted Turkish influence to determine the supremacy of the Turkish nominee against Bin Saood, Mubarak's friend. It was further pointed out that Turkish supremacy in Nejd might involve the destruction of Mubarak's influence and a possible attack on Koweit territory. 5. This view was not altogether accepted by His Majesty's Government, || Vide letter from Sir N. O'Conor to the Marquess but On loth May, Sir N. O Conor drew[] of Lansdowne, No. 373, dated the 16ih May 1904. the attention of the Porte to the understanding arrived at between the Porte and the British Government with regard to Koweit. He said that, as His Majesty's Government had on several occasions cautioned the Sheikh of Koweit to refrain from interfering in neighbouring disturbances, they had a right to expect that the Ottoman Government would do what it could to restrain the Amir of Nejd and refrain from any action which might endanger peace in those regions, whose tran quillity was a matter of interest to His Majesty's Government as well as to that of the Sultan. Sir N. O'Conor gave it as his opinion that he could not press the Turks to desist from sending assistance to Bin Kashid without appearing to be a partisan of Bin Saood. His idea w T as that w r e should confine ourselves, at all events for the present, to maintaining intact the territory of Koweit and to watching developments. 6. This policy appears to have been adopted by His Majesty's Government as, in a telegram, dated 30th December 1904, your predecessor said that His Majesty's Government desired that it should be clearly understood that their interest and influence were to be confined strictly to the coast line of Eastern Arabia, and that nothing should be said or done to connect them even indirectly with warfare in progress in the interior. 'We recently received similar instructions from you in your telegram, dated 9th November 1906, which disposed of the suggestion made by Major Cox. 7. We have already issued the necessary orders to Major Cox to ensure strict adherence to the line of policy which has been laid down, but in the meanwhile we think it our duty to point out that there are indications in the papers received since Major Cox's letter of 16th September 1906 was written, that the position of the Turks in Nejd is becoming increasingly difficult, and that they have been unable to do more than maintain a mere semblance of powert f K. 3 in Hassa where they have recently sustained a somewhat serious reverse at the hands of the local Arabs. They are now trying to re-establish their position there by the despatch of troops, and it was rumoured that they intended to use Bahrein as an intermediate base though this intention was not carried out and the troops were sent direct to Katif. On the other hand, the greater part if not the whole of the Turkish garrisons are stated to have been withdrawn frorn Nejd and Kasim in a pitiable condition and the plans of the Wahabi Chief for dislodging the Turks from Nejd and the Arab littoral seem now to be more within the bounds of possibility. Although it is possible that, • nde despatch from Sir n. g 'Conor to sir as anticipated in Mr. XJoyd s Memoran- Edward Grey, No. 507, dated the 24th July 1906. dum* respecting German influence on the Hedjaz Railway, the completion of the line to Medain-Saleh will aifect the balance of power in western Nejd in favour of^ the Turks, yet it will be a long time before the posts which have been abandoned can be re-occupied by reinforcements from the railway. $ 8. On the whole it seems to us that the situation is developing towards the point at which Sir N. O'Conor in 1904 anticipated that it would be necessary for His Majesty's Government See letter No. 129 (Confidential), dated the 26th ^0 make UD their minds as to the policy February 1904, to the Marquess of Lansdowne. « n 1 j • j j. at • i rri/ J to be followed m regard to JNejd. The question is one primarily for decision by His Majesty's Government, and we hesitate to offer our advice in a matter in which India is only interested in a t vide your despatch No. 35 (Secret), dated the secondary degrcef and merely because a 5th October 1906. disturbance of the position on the Arabian coast might adversely affect Indian trade and our political arrangements in the Gulf. In view however of the rapid asgrandisement of Bin Saood as indi cated by the recent reports, we venture to call attention to the opinion expressed by Sir N. O'Conor in his letter to the Marquess of Lansdowne, No. 37H, dated 16th May 1904, that if Bin Saood succeeds in re-establishing a Wahabi dynasty throughout the centre of Arabia, the result might rentier our influ ence and authority at Koweit precarious. We would also invite a perusal of our Secret despatch No. 7 (External), dated the 11th January 1906, in which we showed that the growing importance of this Chief, if he is hostile to our interests, is a danger to our relations w r ith the Trucial Chiefs. If the Turks are really likely to disappear from the stage, and if Bin Saood is to be a power in the land, it seems to us desirable that this Chiei: should, when a suitable moment arrives, be led to come to a friendly understanding with us. 9. Bin Saood has made a definite request,} through Sheikh Jasim, that a secret understanding may be arranged X Enicosure No. ii. between the British Government and himself under which he may be granted British protection from Turkish assaults at sea in the event of his ever succeeding in driving the Turks unaided out of his ancestral dominions. Having regard to our relations with the Turks, it would of course be impossible that even a secret undertaking to this effect should be given to the Wahabi Chief at present. The difficulty is, however, that, if we hold back too long, we risk the possibility that Bin Saood may succeed in obtaining control over Hassa and Katif without any reference to us, either by arrangement with the Turks, as their representative, or by his own unaided efforts. Kither of these alternatives might be disadvantageous to us. We do not want Turkish power consolidated in Nejd, as our influence over Koweit and the 'J rucial Chiefs might be weakened; similarly, if Bin Saood obtained unquestioned authority in Nejd and Hassa and Katif, he would be a disturbing influence in coast politics if he were not attached to us in some way. 10. But, on the other hand, it is unlikely that the Turks would formally hand over full authority in Nejd, Hassa, and Katif to Bin Saood in response to ' the application which he proposes to make to the Sultan for the Governorship of these districts. Even if they did so, § See Captain Prideaux's letter No. 500, dated Saood, by his OWn admission,§ WOUld tee nth Noremhe. laoe (annexure to enclosure ^ ^ ^ with ^is, but would seize the first opportunity of throwing off the Turkish yoke. Whether he ousted the Turks from Hassaand Katif 'by guile, or by force, gccordirg to his alternative proposal, he would never he able to consolidate his position there so long as the Turks were able to attack him from the sea. On the whole, therefore, it does not appear that we should run any serious risk of alienating Bin Saood by failing to respond immediately and directly to his advances. When, if ever, he success fully vindicates his authority, he will still be compelled to turn to the British Government for protection against attacks by sea, and His Majesty's Government will be in a position, if they consider it to be to their advantage and in consonance with their obligations towards the Porte, to stretch out a hand which Bin Saood will be compelled, in his own interest, to take. Possibly, if the Turks were ousted from Ha&gt;sa and Katif, His Majesty's Government might think it advisable to restrain them from attacking Bin Saood's position on the coast, on the ground that we are responsible for the maritime peace of the Gulf, and that we cannot permit coastal warfare to be pursued to the prejudice of that peace. On this point of general policy we can only say that from an Indian point of view it would be distinctly desirable that the Turks should not possess a semblance of authority on the Eastern Arabian coast south of Zobehr, as their position at Katif and Ojair may easily be embarrassing and encourages the claims to sovereignty over Koweit and even Bahrein which are still put forward. The risk of the lease of harbours to other maritime powers in the gulf would also be greatly decreased. 11. In the meanwhile, as some reply seems to be necessary to the reiterated enquiries w r hich have been made by, or on behalf of. Bin Saood, we propose, subject to ycur approval, to convey an answer to him to the effect that the British Government, while anxious to maintain friendly relations with him, so long as he comports himself in a manner consonant with British interests and our engagements with Arab Sheikhs on the coast, see no necessity, under present conditions, for making him any formal promises of protection which might even have the effect of stimulating Turkish opposition to the consolid ation of his authority. 12. Our anxiety as to the possible effect of the recent changes in Nejd has been heightened by the recent passage of considerable bodies of Turkish troops through Koweit, a proceeding which is in contravention of the terms of the status quo Agreement of 1901 by which the Turks undertook not to send troops to Koweit. It is true that the undertaking which the Porte gave related primarily to the offensive movement of troops by sea to Koweit and did not contemplate such a situation as the present in which the Turks have withdrawn beaten troops by land through Koweit. Still, in our opinion, if the occurrence is allowed to pass unnoticed it will form an inconvenient precedent as tending to bring the Sheikh more directly under Turkish authority or even to facilitate a coup de main on Koweit. If it is repeated and the Sheikh resents it, there is some danger that he may take direct measures to stop the passage of military parties through his territories, and this might at any moment lead to a disagreeable incident necessitating action on our part which it is desirable, if possible, to avoid. According to a report* from • Enclosure No. is. Major Knox the Sheikh has already, on one occasion, felt himself able to refuse to permit some Turkish refugees to enter Koweit and he might now welcome some support on this point from us. This would have the incidental advantage of strengthening our influence at this important point, which is desirable in view of the uncertainty which Sheikh Mubarak apparently feels as to the present policy of the British Government, which has led him to demur to introducing the new Koweit flag and to coquet more openly with the Turkish authorities at Basrah. We therefore invite His Majesty's Government to consider whether the opportunity might not suitably be taken to warn the Turkish Government once more against taking action likely to ' add still further to the disturbed condition of this part of Arabia (see Lord Lansdowme's despatch to Sir N. O'Oonor, No. 177, dated the 10th May 1904), and to intimate to them that, if troops are again moved through Koweit territory on their passage to or from Nejd, His Majesty's Government will be forced to consider what action should be taken to protect their own interests.13. As His Majesty's Government will no doubt desire to obtain the advice of Sir N. O'Conor on the question discussed in the foregoing paragraphs, we have taken the liberty of forwarding a copy of this despatch to Constantinople.

[24] No. 1. Mr. G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—[Received January 1, 1907.) (No. 826.) ^ r ' Constantinople, December 27, 1906. ON the ISth September last I received a telegram from His Majesty's Consul at Bussorah. stating ^ tliat two bales of piece goods, destined for Koweit and overcarried to Bussorab in a British Indian steamer, had been detained at the custom-house on the ground that Koweit was a Turkish port and had no custom-house, and that, therefore, goods must pay import duties at Bussorah. The Director of Customs at Bagdad was said to be acting in this matter on the orders of the Central Customs. As it did not seem desirable to raise the ojuestion of the status of Ivoweit for the sake of so apparently small a matter, I instructed Mr. Crow to endeavour to induce the agent to obtain permission to reship the bales to Bombay. I heard no more of the matter and consequently assumed that it had been settled but having observed from your despatch No. 539 of the 15th instant that the bales of goods were destined for the Sheikh himself, and that he evidently felt strongly on the subject, I telegraphed to Mr. Crow to inquire what had happened. Mr. Crow replied on the 26th instant to the effect that the agent had failed to induce the local Turkish authorities to allow the reshipment of the goods, and that the matter had been referred to the Director of Customs at Bagdad. Had I known that the goods were consigned to Sheikh Mubarek himself, I should have asked for your instructions in the first instance. As the matter stands, if the Turkish authorities persist in their demand for payment of duty and refuse to allow reshipment, I should be glad to learn whether you would wish me to make representations to the Sublime Porte on the subject, insisting on the fact that Koweit is not a lurkish port, or whether I should simply ask that permission may be given for the goods to be reshipped. In the latter case it would no doubt be obvious to the Turkish Government that we were endeavouring to evade the main question of the status of Koweit, and such evasion would very possibly strengthen them in their attitude.

Secretary Morley to forward, for the consideration of the Secretary of f.tate for Foreign Affairs, a copy of a letter from the Govern ment of India, No. 28, Secret, dated 21 February, and enclosures, reviewing the situation and making certain proposals. The first of these proposals is to send a message to SheiKh Jasim for repetition to the WahaM Emir to the effect stated in the 11tn paragraph of the enclosed letter. To this Mr. r/or ley sees no objection with the omission of the words ''under present circumstances^ and 'formal% provided that the message is conveyed in vrriti - g so as to avoid the danger of misrepresentation. But he ,rr ould be glad to be favoured with Sir B. Orey^ vier-s upon the subject. The second proposal is that, in vie^ of the recent passage of considerable bodies of Turkish troops through Koweit, a earning should be addressed to the Subline Porte in the sense of Lord Lansdowne f s despatch to Sir N. O'Conor, No. 177 of the 10th00051 'v? 10th May U 04, together with an intlnation that, if troops are again moved through Ko^eit terri + ory on their passage to or fron Uejd, H.

In view of the fact, stated hy the Governnent of India, that the pa??saje of the troops in question is nerely the withdrawal of beaten troops from the interior, it does not appear to Mr. Horley that there are the sane grounds for a representation to the Porte, which 0 existed when Lord Lanadowne•s despatch above ouoted was written;- and he is not prepared to support this proposal. With regard the general nxes'ion of policy discussed in the e irlier paragraphs of this letter, Mr. liorley s^es no reason at present to alter the policy otatef^ in paragraph 3, viz., f Iiat of strictly confining our interests and influence to the coast line of Eastern Arabia.

The correspondence relates to the overtures made by and on behalf of Abdul' Aziz Bin Saood, the Wahabi Chief, with a view to the establishment of a closer connection between himself and the British Government. Major Cox, our Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, desires to be in a position to give a definite answer to these overtures, and has recommended in his letter!

No. 488, ibid. 1906, that we should take the present opportunity to come to terms with the Wahabi Chief, on the following grounds:— (1) that overtures have been made at various times by Bin Saood himself, . and by Sheikh Jasim-bin-Thani and Sheikh Mubarak on Bin Saood's behalf, with a view to securing for the latter some measure of British protection, and that if we neglect these overtures. Bin Saood and his following may regard us with hostility; (2) that if a friendly understanding were to exist between the British Government and Bin Saood, both the Sultan of Maskat and the Trucial Chiefs 'would be fortified by the knowledge that any attempt on the part of the Wahabi to make a descent upon Oman would involve a preliminary rupture between him and the British Government; (3) that if Bin Saood were our friend he would be able to assist us in suppressing piracies in the northern part of the G ulf; (4) that such a friendly understanding would facilitate Major Cox's dealings with the Trucial Chiefs and would render it possible for our officers to make occasional tours in the Nejd country ; (5) that the Arabs of Central Arabia, apparently driven to desperation by Turkish interference, seem disposed to make common cause to throw off the yoke and are apparently trying to secure the support c n , of the Sheikh of Koweit t Fide enclosures(a) Nos. 4 and o and Mr. Consul McDouall's letters, dated 13th and 17th October and CVCU 01 tilC olieiivll OI 1906 (annexures to enclosure No. 9).

No. 217, ibid. recognised^ as very important that the British Government should be in a position to decide as to the policy to be followed in case of a serious revolutionary outbreak in Npjd and the cessation of Ottoman rule in El Hasa. Your predecessor therefore hinted that, in the event of an alteration of conditions in Nejd in the above-mentioned direction, he might be prepared to consider further a proposal for sending a British officer to liiadh on a mission of enquiry. 4. In May 1904, on hearing that the Turks were collecting troops § Telegram (e) to His Majesty's Secretary of State to assist Bin Rashid, tfae Govei'Dment for India, dated the 29th May 1904. 0 f suggested§ to His Majesty's (e) Pro. No. 250 in Secret e., August 1904, Nos. Government that representations might 286 - 373 - be made by Sir IN. O'Conor to the Porte in order to prevent this. It was urged that our interests in Eastern and Southern Arabia were such that we could not view with indifference intervention on behalf of one of the parties contending for power in Nejd, and that our prestige at Koweit must suffer materially if we permitted Turkish influence to determine the supremacy of the Turkish nominee against Bin Saood, Mubarak's friend. It was further pointed out that Turkish supremacy in Nejd might involve the destruction of Mubarak's influence and a possible attack on Koweit territory. 5. This view was not altogether accepted by His Majesty's Government, but on 15th Mav, Sir N. O'Conor drpwlf D Vide letter (/) from Sir N. 0 Conor to the , .. i? ji -r. ^''ll Marquess of Lansdowne, No. 373, dated the 16th ^He attention 01 tne Porte to the no. 364,^. understanding arrived at between the I orte and the British Government with regard to Koweit. He said that, as His Majesty's Government had on several occasions cautioned the Sheikh of Koweit to refrain from interfering in neighbouring disturbances, they had a right to expect that the Ottoman Government would do what it could to restrain the Amir of Nejd and refrain from any action which might endanger peace in those regions, whose tran- quillity was a matter of interest to His Majesty's Government as well as to that of the Sultan. Sir N. O'Conor gave it as his opinion that he could not press the Turks to desist from sending assistance to Bin Kashid without appearing to be a partisan of Bin Saood. His idea was that we should confine ourselves, at all events for the present, to maintaining intact the territory of Koweit and to watching developments. * 6. This policy appears to have been adopted by His Majesty's Government «*[ Pro. No. ii4i in Secret e., February 1905, as, in a telegram,^' dated 30th December Nos. 1073-1146. j- J ' j xi 1 9 0 4 , J your predecessor said that His Majesty's Government desired that it should be clearly understood that their interest and influence were to be confined strictly to the coast line of Eastern Arabia, and that nothing should be said or done'to connect them even indirectly with warfare in progress in the interior. 'We recently received •• Pro. No. 507 in Secret E., November 1906, similar instructions from VOU in VOUr 4 . telegram,' dated 9th NoTember 1906, which disposed of the suggestion made by Major Cox.7. We have already issued the necessary orders to Major Cox to ensure strict adherence to the line of policy which has been laid down, but in the meanwhile we think it our duty to point out that there are indications in the papers received since Major Cox's letter of 16th September 1906 was written, that the position of the Turks in Nejd is becoming increasingly difficult, and that they have been unable to do more than maintain a mere semblance of power in Hassa where they have recently sustained a somewhat serious reverse at the hands of the local Arabs. They are now trying to re-establish their position there by the despatch of troops, and it was rumoured that they intended to use Bahrein as an intermediate base though this intention was not carried out. and the troops were sent direct to Katif. On the other hand, the greater part if not the whole of the Turkish garrisons are stated to have been withdrawn from Nejd and Kasim in a pitiable condition and the plans of the Wahabi Chief for dislodging the Turks from Nejd and the Arab littoral seem now to be more within the bounds of possibility. Although it is possible that, • vide despatch from Sir n. g 'Conor to sir as anticipated in Mr. Lloyd s Memoran- edwmd grey, No. 507, dated the 24th july 1906. dum* respecting German influence on the Hedjaz Railway, the completion of the line to Medain-Saleh will affect the balance of power in western Nejd in favour of the Turks, yet it will be a long time before the posts which have been abandoned can be re-occupied by reinforcements from the railway. 8. On the whole it seems to us that the situation is developing towards the point at which Sir N. O'Conor in 1904 anticipated that it would be necessary for His Majesty's Government See letter^) No. 129 (Confidential), dated the lir . flipiv TniTifU ^ to fhp -nollPV 26th February 1904, to the Marquess of Lansdowne. tO maKe Up tnCll^ minOS as 10 L ^ pOI Cy (^) Knclosures to irro. No. 217 in Secret E., June ^0 be followed in regard to Nejd. The 1904. nos. 207-218. question is one primarily for decision by His Majesty's Government, and we hesitate to offer our advice in a matter in which India is only interested in a ^ 35 d - ,ed secondary degreef and merely because a (h) Fro. No. 263 in Secret e.. February 1907, disturbance of the position on the Arabian Nos. 261-294. coast might adversely affect Indian trade and our political arrangements in the Gulf. In view however of the rapid aggrandisement of Bin Saood as indicated by the recent reports, we venture to call attention to the opinion expressed by Sir N. O'Conor in his letter to the Marquess of Lansdowne, No. 373, dated X Enclosures to Pro. No. 364 in Secret E., 26thl ^J a y 1904, that if Bin Saood August 1904-, Nos. 286-2/3. , i. i i * 'U • '1X7 I, 'u • succeids m re-establishing a Wahabi dynasty throughout the centre of Arabia, the result might render our influ ence and authority at Koweit precarious. We would also invite a perusal of our Secret despatch No. 7 (External), dated the 11th January 1906, in which we showed that the growing importance of this Chief, if he is hostile to our interests, is a danger to our relations with the Trucial Chiefs. If the Turks are really likely to disappear from the stage, and if Bin Saood is to be a power in the land, it seems to us desirable that this Chief should, when a suitable moment arrives, be led to come to a friendly understanding with us. 9. Bin Saood has made a definite request } § through Sheikh Jasim, that a secret understanding may be arranged § EnicosureNo. n. between the British Government and himself under w^hich he may be granted British protection from Turkish assaults at sea in the event of his ever succeeding in driving the Turks unaided out of his ancestral dominions. Having regard to our relations with the Turke, it would of course be impossible that even a secret undertaking to this effect should be given to the Wahabi Chief at present. The difficulty is, however, that, if we hold back too long, we risk the possibility that Bin Saood may succeed in obtaining control over Hassa and Katif without any reference to us, either by arrangement with the Turks, as their representative, or by his own unaided' efforts. Either of these alternatives might be disadvantageous to us. We do not want Turkish power consolidated in Nejd, as our influence over Koweit and the Trucial Chiefs might be weakened; similarly, if Bin Saood obtained unquestioned authority in Nejd and Hassa and K.atif, be would b6''''■jlMiHi itlifi i 4. the 17th Kovember 1906 (annez-ure to enclosure Ho. 11). a disturbing influence in coast politics if he were not attached to us in some way. 10. But, on the other hand, it is unlikely that the Turks would formally hand over full authority in Nejd, Ilassa, and Katif to Bin Saood in response to the application which he proposes to make to the Sultan for the Governorship of these districts. Even if they did so, • See Captain Pridennx's letter No. 500. dated ]3i n gaood, by his OWU admission,* WOuld not long rest content with this, but would seize the first opportunity of throwing off the Turkish yoke. 'Whether he ousted the Turks from Hassa and Katif by guile, or by force, gocordirg to his alternative proposal, he would never be able to consolidate his position there so long as the Turks were able to attack him from the sea. On the whole, therefore, it does not appear that we should run any serious risk of alienating Bin Saood by failing to respond immediately and directly to his advances. When, if ever, he success fully vindicates his authority, he will still be compelled to turn to the British Government for protection against attacks by sea, and His Majesty's Government will be in a position, if they consider it to be to their advantage and in consonance with their obligations towards the Porte, to stretch out a hand which Bin Saood will be compelled, in his own interest, to take. Possibly, if the Turks were ousted from Ha^sa and Katif, His Majesty's Government might think it advisable to restrain them from attacking Bin Saood's position on the coast, on the ground that we are responsible for the maritime peace of the Gulf, and that we cannot permit coastal warfare to be pursued to the prejudice of that peace. On this point of general policy we can only say that from an Indian point of view it would be distinctly desirable that the Turks should not possess a semblance of authority on the Eastern Arabian coast south of Zobehr, as their position at Katif and Ojair may easily be embarrassing and encourages the claims to sovereignty over Koweit and even Bahrein which are still put forward. The risk of the lease of harbours to other maritime powers in the gulf would also be greatly decreased. 11. In the meanwhile, as some reply seems to be necessary to the reiterated enquiries which have been made by, or on behalf of. Bin Saood, we propose, subject to your approval, to convey an answer to him to the effect that the British Government, while anxious to maintain friendly relations with him, so long as he comports himself in a manner consonant with British interests and our engagements with Arab Sheikhs on the coast, see no necessity, under present conditions, for making him any formal promises of protection which might even have the effect of stimulating Turkish opposition to the consolid ation of his authority. 12, Our anxiety as to the possible effect of the recent changes in Nejd has been heightened by the recent passage of considerable bodies of Turkish troops through Koweit, a proceeding which is in contravention of the terms of the status quo Agreement of 1901 by which the Turks undertook not to send troops to Koweit. It is true that the undertaking which the Porte gave related primarily to the offensive movement of troops by sea to Koweit and did not contemplate such a situation as the present in which the Turks have withdrawn beaten troops by land through Koweit. Still, in our opinion, if the occurrence is allowed to pass unnoticed it will form an inconvenient precedent as tending to bring the Sheikh more directly under Turkish authority or even to facilitate a coup de main on Koweit. If it is repeated and the Sheikh resents it, there is some danger that he may take direct measures to stop the passage of military parties through his territories, and this might at any moment lead to a disagreeable incident necessitating action on our part which it is desirable, if possible, to avoid. According to a reportf from t Enclosure No. is. Major .Knox the Sheikh has already, on one occasion, felt himself able to refuse to permit some Turkish refugees to enter Koweit and he might now welcome some support on this point from us. This would have the incidental advantage of strengthening our influence at this important point, which is desirable in view of the uncertainty which Sheikh Mubarak apparently ieels as to the present policy of the British t■ V 0007^ Goyernment, whicli has led him to demur to introducing the new Koweit flag and to coquet more openly with the Turkish authorities at Basrah. We therefore invite His Majesty's Government to consider whether the opportunity might not suitably he taken to warn the Turkish Government once more against taking action likely to ' add still further to the disturbed condition of this part of Arabia ' (see Lord Lansdowne's despatch to Sir N. O'Conor, • Pro. No. 357 in Secret E., August 1904, No. l77j* dated the 10th May 1904), N ob. 286 -373. an( i to intimate to them that, if troops are again moved through Koweit territory on their passage to or from Nejd, His Majesty's Government will be forced to consider what action should be taken to protect their own interests. 13. As His Majesty's Government will no doubt desire to obtain the advice of Sir N. O'Conor on the question discussed in .the foregoing paragraphs, we have taken the liberty of forwarding a copy of this despatch to Constantinople.

' Ambassador at Constantinople, the views expressed by Your Excellency's Government as to the general situation in Central Arabia, His Majesty's Government see no reason to modify the policy laid down in my predecessor's telegram of the 30tli December 1904, and repeated in my telegram of the 9th November 1906, that British interests and influence in those regions should be strictly confined to the coast; and they agree with Sir N. O'Conor that it would be most unwise for them to entangle themselves with the Wahabi Amir, or in any other way to interfere in the internal affairs of Arabia. 3. The terms of the reply which, in paragraph 11 of your letter, you propose to return to Bin Saood. appear to His Majesty's Govern ment to bo open to objection as implying an approval of the consoli dation of the Wahabi power, and consequently a certain interference in Arabian affairs. No such communication should therefore be made- But if Major Cox finds it impossible to avoid giving some answer to those who have approached him on the Wahabi Amir's behalf, he should inform them, as Bin Saood's proposals involve considerations which it is impossible for His Majesty's Government to entertain, that no reply is to be expected. 4. With regard to your further proposal that representations should be made to the Borte regarding the passage through Koweit of Turkish troops on their way back from the interior. Sir N. O'Conor is of opinion s. 16. A w\ t) V that a protest made so long after the event would only provoke ill-feeling, without any corresponding advantages. In this view His Majesty's Government concur. I have the honour to be, My Lord, Your Lords!)ip's most obedient humble Servant, (Signed) John Morley.r^cs ENCLOSURE. Enclosure No. 1. India Office to Poreign Office. India Office, Sir, 27tli March 1907. In continuation of previous correspondence relative to affairs in Nejd, ending with the telegram from the Viceroy of the 15th February last, I am directed by Mr. Secretary Morley to forward, for the consi deration of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, a copy of a letter from the Government of India, No. 28 (Secret), of 21st February, and enclosures, reviewing the situation and making certain proposals. The first of these proposals is to send a message to Sheikh Ja^im, for repetition to the Wahabi Emir, to the effect stated in the 11th para graph of the enclosed letter. To this Mr. Morley sees no objection, with the omission of the words under present circumstances,' and 'formal,' provided that the message is conveyed in writing so as to avoid the danger of misrepresentation. But he would be glad to be favoured with Sir E Grey's views upon the subject. The second proposal is that, in view of the recent passage of considerable bodies of Turkish troops through Koweit, a warning should be addressed to the Sublime Porte in the sense of Lord Lansdowne's Despatch to Sir N. O'Conor, No. 177, of the 10th May 1904, together with an intimation that, if troops are again moved through Koweit territory on their passage to or from JS'ejd, His Majesty's Government will be forced to consider what action should be taken to protect their own interests. In view of the fact, stated by the Government of India, that the passage of the troops in question is merely the withdrawal of beaten troops from the interior, it does not appear to Mr. Morley that there are the same grounds for a representation to the Porte which existed when Lord Lansdowne's Despatch above quoted was written; and lie is not prepared to support this proposal. With regard to the general question of policy discussed in the earlier paragraphs of this letter Mr. Morley sees no reason at present to alter the policy stated in paragraph 6, viz., that of strictly confining our interests and influence to the coast line of Eastern Arabia. I have, &amp;c., The Under Secretary of State, A. ( j ODLEY. Foreign Office. Enclosure No. 2. Foreign Office to India Office. No. 11,067. Foreign Office, Sir, 16th April 1907. I am directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo, relative to the affairs of Nejd, and containing copy of a letter from the Government of India, reviewing the situation and making certain proposals. In reply, I am to transmit to you, to be laid before Mr. Secretary Morley, copy of a Despatch which has since been received from His s. 16. A 2tseeusi Majesty s Ambassador at Constantinople, commenting on the same letter, which was simultaneously forwarded to His Excellency. Sir N. O'Conor, in discussing the situation and outlook, strongly urges that it would be most unwise for His Majesty's Government to entangle themselves with Ibn Saood or in any other way interfere in the internal affairs of Arabia. Sir E. Grey is disposed to concur in this view, and he considers that it would be therefore inadvisable to carry out the proposal of the Government of India contained in paragraph 11 of their Despatch, even as amended in accordance with Mr. Morley's suggestions, as this would imply an appro\al of the consolidation of Ibn Saood's authority, and consequently a certain interference in Arabian affairs. Sir E. Grey equally concurs in Sir N. O'Conor's suggestion that representations to the Porte with reference to the passage of some Turkish troops through Koweit territory would be undesirable at this distance of time from the actual event. * I am, &amp;c., The Under Secretary of Stale F. A. C ampbell. for India. Annex. Sir N. O'Conor to Foreign Office. j N o . 198. (Confidential.) Constantinople, Sir, _ 1st April 1907. I have the honour to inform you that I have received from the Government of India a copy of their Despatch to Mr. Morley, No. 28 (Secret), of 1907, and I venture to offer the following remarks on its contents. It is difficult to forecast events in Turkey and particularly so in Arabia, where the Ottoman Government have so olten re-established authority which seemed to have passed from their grasp. But it looks just now as if Ibn Saood might possibly consolidate a Wahabee dynasty by the absorption of Nejd, the practical expulsion of the Turks from Ivassim and Boreyda, and by establishing friendly relations with Sheikh Jasim of Katr and the Hassa regions. At the same time it would be unwise to conclude that the Turkish Government cannot recover their ground, or that Ibn Saood will be able to amalgamate tribal interests in such a manner as to resist the forces of the Suzerain Power and continue his victorious course. It may be that all that is national, in feeling and aspiration, may group itself around Ibn Saood, but all the elements of a firm and stable regime are well nigh wanting so far, and I should be slow to assume that we are on the eve of important changes in those parts. Moreover, Ibn baood has not yet had to deal with a large Turkish military force, partly owing to tribal disturbances, and partly to his double-faced policy towards the Sultan. It is by no means certain, however, that if he openly declares his hostility to the Caliph, the energetic commandant of the Sixth Army Corps,' Pertev Pasha, who is now reorganizing this corps at Bagdad, will not crush him before he has time or means for resistance. I confess I see nothing to be gained by entangling ourselves with him under present circumstances, and I do not see how we can, with political honesty, assist his insurrectionary movement against, for instance. El Hassa, which w^e recognise as an integral part of the Ottoman Empire. We can hardly approach the Porte with a declaration, disguised how it may be diplomatically, that we shall protect a rebel who is in arms for the disintegration of the Empire. Even were we t o do so, I should have no faith in the phenomenon of political gratitude from an Arab race.Apart from this, I am not at all sure how far the establishment of a strong and fanatical Wahabee dynasty in those parts would serve our interests ; on the contrary, I am of opinion that our right policy is to interfere as little as possible with the internal affairs of these tribes, and let them work out their own destiny as best they can. If, in the course of time, Ibn Saood, or another, should succeed in establishing their rule and authority under some more or less stable order of Government, it might be necessary to consider whether w r e should recognise them as representative of the will of the people, and even, perhaps, to consider how far it would be desirable to protect their coasts from predatory or other attacks. Eut this is some way off, and before a confederacy of the Arab states of Mohammerah, Koweit, and ISejd is in existence, the chances are that the present Ottoman regime will have come to an end and be succeeded by a nationalist and popular Government, or that the disintegration of the component parts of the Empire will have begun. In the latter case we cannot escape our responsibilities, but I should be sorry to see England enter into relations with a new Turkish regime, having previously agreed to a secret arrangement with Ibn Saood for the disruption of the Empire. The Moslems of this country would never forgive nor forget such a policy. As regards the idea that I should bo instructed to make representa tions to the Porte with reference to the passage of some Turkish troops through Koweit territory, I venture to submit that if these expostula tions had been made within even a few months of the circumstance complained of, it might have been in place, but if we raised such a question after a lapse of eight months, it would provoke much ill-feeling without, so far as I can see, any corresponding advantages. If we want to assert our predominance in Koweit, I would on the whole prefer to insist upon the evacuation of Bubian Island should Ottoman gendarmes still be there. But this I do not advocate at present, although at some future time we may have to remind The Porte of the subject. I quite understand the unpleasant position in which Major Cox is placed by not being able to reply satisfactorily to the overtures of Ibn Saood or Sheikh Jasim, but I do not see how this can bo avoided, and after all it is better than pledging ourselves to unknown risks and responsibilities. As regards a descent of Ibn Saood on the Oman coast and his assistance in repressing piracy and his influence with the Trucial Chiefs, I venture to think that there is as little chance of his being able to be really uselul to us as there is of his daring to attack the maritime Chiefs who are under our protection. It would be well, however, carefully to watch the proceedings and policy of this somewhat active Sheikh while strictly maintaining with the Sheikh of Koweit the engagements which we have undertaken.

V: From T he ASSISTANT To SECRETARY to the GOVERNMENT of INDIA in the Foreign Department, Major P # Z. Cox, C.I.S,, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Dated Simla, the J une 190 7. m. SlE, I am directed to forward, herewith, a copy of a Confidential Memorandum, ITo # 6, dated the lEth May 190*7, received from the Political Resident in Turkish Arabia, and to request that a report may 'be furnished as to the truth of the statements recorded in paragraph 1 thereof regarding 'i or 0 the Sheikh of Koweit. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant. Assistant Secretary to the Govt, of India VConfidential Memorandum No. 6, 1. Koweit. —It is said here that Khalid, who is a son of Muhammad and a nephew of Sheikh Mubarak, has been made a Pasha, that he is on very good terms with Sheikh Mubarak, from whom he has received £T. 8,000 and 200 camels. It is also said that the Sultan has sent presents to Mubarak and settled on him an allowance of £T. 150 a month. Mubarak is said to have sent 15 horses to the Sultan, but my informant could not tell me who had bought the presents nor by what road the horses had been sent. 2. Doctor Grothe. —A German named Dr. Hugo Grothe has been here for some time. He told me that he was an ethnographist and geographer, but I see that on his visiting card which is printed in Turkish and English, he describes himself as a Doctor of Law and Philosophy and General Secretary of the Munich Oriental Society. He has been travelling a good deal in Turkey and is now going to Pushti Kuh with the Vali of Pushti Kuh who is at Baghdad. In spite of Dr. Grothe's assertions to the contrary there is no doubt that he is engaged in making commercial enquiries, perhaps with special reference to agricultural questions and banking. When he passed through Mosul the Consular Agent there reported that he was a member of the German Board of Trade, and that he had written to Germany to induce a German manufacturer to send out pumps for irrigation. Several persons to whom Mr. Lloyd has applied for information have remarked that he seems to want all the same information that is asked for by Doctor Grothe. I heard at Baghdad that Doctor Grothe had called on the local representa tive of the Senniye and tried to induce him to buy German pumps. This official is said to have telegraphed to Constantinople for orders and to have received a reply that he was not at present to buy any German goods. 3. English Education.-—Soms weeks ago the Chief Eabbi told me that he hoped to open a new school for teaching English. He has recently sent me a message to tell me that he hears that there will be official opposition. If I were to attempt to press the matter, I should do more harm than good, but I may be able to put in a word for English education when the Vali pays his promised visit to the Protestant school at Baghdad, The head of the Mission has been away for some time at Mosul. 4. Russian Consul'General. —The Hussian Consul-General recently mentioned to me that he had made the acquaintance of Sheikh Humaidi, who is a son of Farhan Pasha, the Chief of the Jarbeh Shammar tribe, who live on the Tigris above Baghdad. I had just before heard that he had given a magazine rifle to Humaidi. Mons. Maschkoff, the present Consul-General for Russia, is a man of curious character. He is the most sociable, generous, and hospitable man that I know. Consequently he has a large circle of acquaintances and gets much information. He is assisted by a Madame Dejasky, who lives at the Russian Consulate, and who is a very good linguist, and fond of going into Muhammadan female society. Mons. Maschkoff ought to be a man of considerable influence in Baghdad, but I doubt if he is. He makes himself too cheap I think, and he has a violent temper which is likely to get him into trouble any day. It is nothing unusual for him, to commit an assault in the street.5. Vali of Fushti Kuh. —The Yali of Pushti Kuli has been to call on me. I helieve that the other Consuls paid him the first call, but partly by luck and partly by good management on the part of Mr. Gaskin he came to see me first. When I returned his call he was surrounded by people trying to sell bim rubbish; among others one man was trying to sell him spectacles. I said that the proper selection of glasses required skill and the use of instruments and lenses, and I promised to send the Eesidency Surgeon down the next day to test his eyes. The Vali seemed very pleased with the idea and he was grateful when Dr. McConaghy w r ent to see him. I am ordering three pairs of glasses for the Yali and shall in due course ask the Government of India to let me charge the cost to ' Durbar Presents '. The Vali said that Dr. Grothe was going with him. I mentioned to the Yali that the Government of India was sending two officers to Kermanshah to buy mules, and he said that there were plenty of good mules in Pushti Kuh and that if I would let him know when the officers arrived he would send men to escort the officers through his country from near Badra to Kermanshah and also see that they saw a good collection of mules. The Vali appeared to be friendly. I took him over the Eesidency and showed him the ' Comet '. On hearing that Dr. Grothe was going with the Yali to Pushti Kuh, I telegraphed to the British Minister at Tehran, asking whether he would like me to attempt to discourage the proposal and if lie thought it would be a good thing to obtain the support of the Russian Consul-General. The Minister replied that it was better to be neutral, but that I should inform the Consul- General of what I heard. Mons. Maschkoif professed to know little about Grothe, but he said that it would be easy to stop his sroing with the Vali. I said that I did not see how this could be done, and he replied that it could be done by giving a hint to Ghulam Baza Khan (the Vali). I said that it was not worth while to do that, and Mons. Maschkoff then said that he agreed with me and that the Germans would get what information they wanted. At present Mons. Maschkoff is not on very good terms with the German Consul and I cannot avoid the impression that he suggested making difficulties to see if I would agree, and that he was not really inclined to do anything contrary to German interests. This impression is caused more by Mons. Maschkoff's manner than by any words that he used. Has he received instructions not to pull against the Germans ? There are various stories to account for the presence at Baghdad of the Yali of Pushti Kuh. One story is that one of the Shah's brothers is trying to persuade him to declare against the present Shah and that he has left his country to avoid taking any decided line of action. The more plausible story is that the Yali has been having differences of opinion with his son and his brother and that they all three came here on the under standing that they should take a mutual oath in the sacred shrine at^Kerbala. The Yali has given me the name of a British subject as the person through whom I can best communicate with him, and I have also found a Baghdad Jew who has agents in Pushti Kuh. 6. Kyazim Pasha. —By the last mail I received an envelope from Paris addressed to the British Consul-General, and when I opened it I found two closed letters—one addressed to Kyazim Pasha and the other to Ismail Bey. I do not know who Ismail Bey is, but Kyazim Pasha is a brother-in-law of the Sultan, who has been in disgrace for some years. I believe that one of his alleged crimes was that he was too friendly with the English, and that be wanted to sell to them some of his landed property. I have never met Kyazim Pasha and my native agent informs me that he has declined to receive him on a former occasion. I do not quite know what to do with the letters; I think I shall keep them on the chance of getting a convenient opportunity of deliver ing them, with a warning that I cannot allow myself to be used as a post office for clandestine correspondence. It is, of course, possible that the letters are not genuine and that a trap is being made for me. 7. Kazi of Baghdad. —In my confidential memorandum No. 1,1 gave an account of a rather interesting message sent to me by the Kazi of Baghdad.When the late Vali left Baghdad, about February last, the Kazi became acting Vali and I seized the opportunity to call on him. He did not return my call for some time, so I told my native agent to ask him the reason. He replied that he was afraid to be seen at the British Eesidency and I said that I did not wish to press the point. A few days ago I came face to face with him on Mons. Maschkoff's lawn and the next day he sent a message to say that he would like to call on me. The interview has not yet taken place and I shall be much interested to hear how he accounts for this sudden change of attitude. 8. Russian Stationnaire.—^hQ Eussian Consul-General informed Mr. Gaskin a few days ago that the Russian Government were sending a steamer to Bushire to remain at the disposal of the Eussian Eepresentative there. Mons. Maschkoff said that he had last heard of the steamer at Perim. 9. German There seems little doubt that there will be a German Bank in Baghdad before long. Dr. Gauthmann (?) of the Deutsche-Orient Bank is expected here in the course of the next three or four weeks. 10. JDisturhances on the Baghdad is entirely cut off from tele graphic communication and there are the most disquieting rumours about. On the 11th of May, the Vali of Baghdad sent to ask me if I had heard anything of an attack on'one of Lynch's steamers; to-day (the 12rh) I have heard one story that the British Consulate at Hasrah has beer) attacked and another that the tribes in the lower Tigris are in a very disturbed state. It is impossible to guess what foundation there is for these stories. Baghdad, ^ J.

Sheikh Mubarek returned to-day about midday from Mohammerah. He was visited at Fayliah by two of the sons of his elder brother, the late Sheikh Muhammad. On the first day came Saood alone and did not receive a very warm welcome but the second day came Saood and Subah. Sheikh Mubarek is very fond of the latter who is reported to be of a quiet unassuming disposition and to have no taste for his brother's intrigues.The meeting was very affection ate and Sheikh Mubarek presented his nephews with T£ 1,000 for the restocking of a date garden called Az-Zain ruined in the spring by a storm and promised further help. ov r■a *&lt; A eopj of each of the foregoing oormrnmications is forwarded to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, for information, in continuation of the correspondence ending with his letter TTo.lH77 dated 16th June 1907.

In view of the report from Mr. Crow at Basra, dated April 17th, as to the action contemplated by Sheikh Mubarak against Ajman tribe, His Majesty s Ambassador at Constantinople suggests that influence should be exer cised to prevent military operations being undertaken by feheikh save in self defence against the tribe.

Sir, I have the honour to transmit herewith copy of a despatch from His Majesty's Consul at Basra, respecting events in Central Arabia, The news of Bin Saud's defeat, if true, is important, especially if it is the issue (of. fighting on a large scale, such as was anticipated in the second of the reports from Mr. Consul Devey, inclosed in my despatch No. 257 of 30th April. _ It seems to me to show the impolicy of intervention on the part of] His Majesty's Government in the entanglements of internal conflicts between) the Arab tribes, and to confirm the view as to the prudence of abstention which; I expessed in my despatch No. 198, confidential of April 1st. The influence of His Majesty's Government should however I think be exercised on Sheikh Mubarak to prevent his undertaking military operations, save in self defence. If we do not show our displeasure at aggressive action on his part he may presume on our support, and I venture again to repeat that I am by no means sure that if Pertev Pasha, the Chief of the Staff of the 6th Army Corps, who has now been ordered to Basra to restore order there were to organise a punitive ex pedition against Mubarak he would not be successful. The result would produce a very complicated situation in which we might be called upon to intervene. I never felt assured that any overtures made to Bin Saud, whether through Mubarak or otherwise, would not be revealed to the Turkish Government and the fact that he is now sending a messenger to Constantinople makes one think that his Majesty's Government were well advised in discountenancing: anv nroiect of that kind. ^ I have, etc., , N. R. O'CONOE. Mr. Crow to Sir JS, O'Conor, No. 31. Sir, I have received the following information from the Political Ao-ent at Koweit regarding events in Central Arabia. Basra, 17th Jpril 1907.2 Maliomed Bin Ithnain. Sheikh oF the Shia tribe, broke off his alliance with Bin Saud, because the latter had killed two of bis followers for intriguing and sousrht refuge with Sheikh Mubarak of Koweit on 6th March last. He was kindly received but advised to return to his own country. Bin Saud is said to have tried to raid the Shammers, but the lattev collected in force and Bin baud retreated to Boreyda. By order of the Sheikh of Koweit, heavy dues are levied on the Haj Caravan from Koweit to Mecca £T 5 on each woman's litter £r.l on each camel rider, Es. 16 heail were levied on Hi slaves brought from Mecca to Koweit by the Haj Caravan. Customs duties are being raised all round. The Sheikh of Koweit is preparing to raid the Ajman tribe of Bedouins for stealing *20 herds from Koweit Bedouins in February last. About 200 towns men, exclusive ol Bedouins, have been enlisted and all the Haj camels and their furniture, as well as a cargo of arms which lately arrived, have been commandeered by the Sheikh of Koweit for the foray. The Umtair and Thaffir Bedouins are assisting Sheikh Mubarak in the business and the latter is forming his camp at Sirra. The news received at Basra regarding Nejd events is meagre. Tzzet Pasha, late Commandant at Basra, received permision to proceed to Constantinople with two followers of Bin Saud named Salih U1 Addil, former Sheikh of Eass, who was a partisan of Bin Kashid and came over to Bin Sand's side after the former's death, and Ibrahim-el Damer. These tw^o gentlemen who proceeded to Constantinople to do homage to the Saltan on behalf of Bin Sand, left by the Burhanieh for Bagdad on April 10th. They received from the Turkish Govern ment £T'450 for journey expenses and an outfit allowance of £T-5 and ara each accompanied by a scribe and servant. On April 13th a letter reached the Yilayet of Basra to the effect that Sultan el-Hamud had fought with the Arabs of Bin Saud near Kasim and killed many of them. It is said that Bin Saud alone escaped. I am not yet in possession of details of the engagement. I have, etc., F. E. CROWN. Telegram dated the 21st June 1907.

Our information as reported under Koweit in diaries of Persian Gulf Political Residency for weeks ending 24th and 31st March, 7th April and 5th May 1907, {vide enclosures in Foreign Secretary's weekly letters Nos. 16, 17, and 21-M., dated 18th and 25th April and 2yrd May 1907, respectively) is that Sheikh Mubarak only arranged to make reprisals on Ajman near Koweit for thefts of 20 herds of Koweit cattle, and that his threat has been sufficient to induce tribe to come to terms. Our officers in the Gulf, who have been watching the matter carefully, have not reported that there is any danger of widespread disturbances, or that any further warning to the Sheikh is necessary. In the circumstances we would prefer not to issue further warnings to the Sheikh against mixing himself up with the tribes of the interior, as this might tend to weaken our influence over him, unless His Majesty's Government have information to a different effect.{Received on 10th June 1907, with Political Secretary's letter No. 21, dated the 24th May 1997.)

No. 257. CONSTANTINOPLB ; April 30, 1907. Sir, With reference to my despatch No. 198 of the 3st instant, I have the honour to transmit herewith copies of two despatches from His Majesty's Consul at Damascus respecting affairs in the Nejd. In the first of these despatches Mr. Devey gives a new version of the circumstances in which Mut'ih-er-Eashid was murdered, and relates a ghastly tale of treachery. In the second despatch he gives an account of the relations between Ibn Saoud and the new Emir of Hail It appears that Iba Saoud replied to SuHan-ibn-Rashid's offer of friendship by an intolerable list of conditions, and that as a result Sultan-ibn -Kashid has raised a very considerable force with which to attack Ibn Saoud, No fighting has yet taken place, but Mr. Devey anticipates that it will end in favour of Ibn Saoud. I have, etc., N. R. O'CONOR. Mr. Devey to Sir iV. O* Conor. No. 16. Damascus ; April 8, 1907, Sm, With reference to my despatch No. 9 of the 22nd February last, respect ing the murder of Mut'ib-er-Kashid and the succession of his cousin, Sultan-ibn- Hamoud-er -Eashid I have the honour to report to Your Excellency that the version given there as to the murder of Mut'ib by Telal-er-Rashid, having Sultan as its author, appears now, in the face of a new report that reached me on a very good authority, to be erroneous and a falsehood created by the actual murderer. The plot against the life of Mut'ib and his brothers was organized by Sultan in the following way :— First of all Sultan persuaded Mut'ib to send his mother (sister of Sultan) to Mecca for the Haj and to escort her with a large number of his most faithful servants and attendants, including Ikab, the bravest and most daring of the bodyguards of Mut'ib, and Abdur Rahman, the wisest and most devoted of his advisers. Securing the success of this first step by which Mut'ib was deprived of his best men. Sultan proposed to him an ibex shooting party far away from 12 Hail to which proposition Mut'ib innocently agreed. The members of the party were Mut'ib, his two brothers, Mashaal and Mohammed, and his consin, Telal, on one side, and Sultan, his two brothers, Saoud and Peissal, and his cousin, Dhari, on the other, with a big number of servants and attendants. After they lunched at a certain fountain in the open country Sultan, suggested that^the eight of them would go ahead and leave their followers at lunch. Mut'ib accepted the suggestion and the above mentioned eight chiefs rode together side by side. When they were at a distance far enough from the camp, Sultan and his brothers and cousin, in execution of their plot, rode alongside of the others, and at a signal from Sultan shot them dead. Sultan killed Mut'ib, Saoud killed Mashaal, Eeissal killed Mohammed and Dhari killed Telal. They rode back to the camp and told that Telal killed Mut'ib and his brothers, and that they, the murderers, avenged for their death and killed Telal. Consequently Sultan was proclaimed Emir of Shammer at the camp and marched back to Hail triumphantly. He broke the news to the whole tribe and to the neighbouring chiefs and finally to the Turkish authorities at Medina, Damascus and Constantinople in the same form as stated in the despatch under reference. Hamoud-er-Rashid, the father of Sultan, was greatly displeased by the cruelty of his son towards his grandsons, and in mark of his disapproval of those atrocities he left Hail and started to Medina where he arrived yesterday to spend the remaining days of his life there. He telegraphed his arrival at Medina to one of his friends here. I have, etc., G. P. DEVEY. Mr. Devey to Sir N. 0'Conor, No. 18. D amascus ; . April 15, 1907. S ir, With reference to my despatch No. 16 of the 8th instant, I have the honour to submit the following report on the actual relations between Sultamibn- Eiashid and Abdul Aziz-ibn Saoud of the Nejd with the events that took place since the succession oi the former to the principality of Jebel Shammer at Hail. When Sultan became the master of Hail he wrote to Ibn Saoud who was then at Bureideh of Kassim, telling him of the events which led to his succes sion and asking him to recognise that change, proposing at the same time friendly relations between Hail and Riadh. Ibn Saoud replied that he would be glad to maintain the good relations and accept the friendliness offered on the following conditions: — (1) The members of Abul Kheil family of Bureideh, rival of Ibn Saoud, now refugees at Hail, should be expelled from that town. (2) The 30 swords and 300 Martini rifles taken from Ibn Saoud's men by Mohammed-ibn-Rashid 20 years ago should be returned. (3) The two cannon at Hail given by the Turkish Government must be handed over to Ibn Saoud. (4) The Muteir tribe which frequently annoys Ibn Saoud by its raids against his partisans should be fought by I bn Rashid. (5) Ibn Rashid should not communicate or conclude treaties with any people beyond Jebel Shammer except through Ibn Saoud.(6) Ibn Eastiid would not be allowed to march with a standard of his own unless authorised by Ibn Saoud to do so. (7) The expenses of the recent mobilizations at Kassim amounting to £ T. 5,000 incurred by Ibn Saoud for an expedition against Mut'ib, the late princCj should be paid by Ibn Hashid. Certainly Ibn Rashid refused to agree to these hard terms and marched out from Hail with 4,000 cavalry and about 15,000 camel-riders to meet Ibn Saoud who was at the head of a considerable force coming from Kassim to Hail in support of his demands. Seeing that his forces were inferior to those of his rival, Ibn Saoud, who never anticipated that Sultan-ibn-Eashid, the murderer of his cousins, the usurper of their posts and the newly proclaimed prince, would be able to have such a large force under him, at once retired and recrossed the Pach back to Kassim, where he is now calling his various allies to his help. Sultan-ibn-Rashid is at the present moment camping at a place called Kehefa, one day's journey from the frontier of Kassim, and as soon as the mobilizations of Ibn Saoud are complete, probably an action will take place between the two rival princes, the issue of which will be, with probability, in favour of the latter. I have, etc., G. P. DEVEY. {Received on 1st July 1907, with Political Secretary's letter No, 24, dated 14th June 1907.) ASIATIC TURKEY . [ May 14] CONFIDENTIAL . Section 1. [15856.] No. 1.

Nazareth ; March 28, 1907. I met Dr. Gould in Acre yesterday, who is a medical missionary, just come in for a few days from Es Salt on the far side of Jordan, He gets several patients from the Nejd, and can in this way get a good deal of news from these Sand the various Arab tribes east of Jordan. He tells me that he had last heard that Ibn Saoud, having defeated Ibn Rashid, was marching on Bail. This you have already got; he had heard of no result of the fight yet. He told me that there have been signs lately of a general movement among the Arabs to attack the railway, probably at the present rail-head or somewhere in that direction. The Arabs quite see that it will be the means of bringing down Turkish troops to get into Central Arabia, and they are getting more and more hostile to it. Gould thought there were signs of a movement in the immediate future, and said that the Turks for the last three months have been steadily sending reinforcements down the line to rail-head. In the country just east of Es Salt and the desert on the far side of the line at Amman the principal Arab tribes are the Adwan and Sahur. The Adwan are a confederation v/ith seven minor tribes depending, and the Adwan Chief Sheikh or Sheikh-i-Sultan, as he is called, can control them all. Martinis are plentiful and every Arab has one, obtained from the large numbers captured from the Turks in the Yemen at various times or smuggled in from coast ports. The Sahur do not go with the Adwan and are a smaller tribe. There are no signs at present of any movement among these Arabs, but all are jealous of the advance of the line. The Circassian Colonies at Amman, Es Salt, and neighbourhood are meant to protect the line from Arab inroads, but they themselves are very independent and care little for the Government, although they hate the Arabs too. F.tS. —Gould gets some strange patients from Nejd, some had never seen bread or rice, as they get nothing but camel's milk and dates in some places, and flour is imported. Another said he had ■once seen a piece of soap, but had not touched it. Gould has written a very interesting book about the siege of Acre, published by the Palestine Exploration Eund. Inclosure 2 in No. 1. Majo v Maunsell to Colonel Count Gleichen. D amascus ; April 7, 1907. (Extract.) The Moslem populat'on of Syria is large in proportion to the number of Eedif they have to furnish, and the great losses of the Yemen would not be so severely felt as might be imagined, and the men might be found, but equipment would be very deficient. In Haifa I saw tlie German Colony founded some thirty years ago and still fairly flourishing, but the second generation of colonists falls off very quickly from the German original and soon becomes Levantine of rather an inferior quality. The country is unsuited to colonists from JSTorthern Europe, who have to work in the fields or vineyards. German influence is, I think, rather exaggerated in this country; the people are disliked everywhere by their overbearing manner (too much mailed- fist ' Sedanfest '), and no one has a good w r ord for tliem, although the Colonies themselves are well ordered and fairly flourishing. The Deutsche Palestina .Bank has branches in Haifa and Nazareth (recently opened), and some German colonists have been buying land on the shore of Tiberias at Magdala and also on the plain of Jezreel, but the Turks place all possible difficulties in the way of purchase. 4t5 Russian influence has greatly gone down since the Japanese war and their school propaganda has practically ceased. Their large hospices in Jerusalem and Nazareth, which look like barracks, are necessary for the immense number of pilgrims that pass through. I saw 1,000 entering Nazareth who had walked from Jerusalem. French influence is not so great as formerly, and does not extend far outside the walls of their large monasteries. The Franciscans seem the most powerful, with unlimited money. Our influence is perhaps the greatest of all foreign Powers, owing to Egypt being so close. English is the language every one wants to learn in the schools. Inclosure 3 in No. 1. Major Maunsell to Colonel Count Gleichen. D amascus ; April 16, 1907. Dear Gleichen, I hare just returned from a journey down to Tebuk, and rail-head now near Akhdar, where they have made a tunnel. The desert was most interesting, and I was able to pick up a good deal of news about, Nejd affairs, work on the railway, &amp;c., which would have been impossible here. Construction work is done almost entirely by military labour, about 5,000 men being at work about Akhdar and southwards towards Medain-i-Salih. The garrison of Medina, now some 3,000 men (six battalions), under the direction of some engineer officers, have begun work from Medina doing simply the earthwork and leaving the culverts and bridges until they join up with the line from Medain-i-Salih. These two forces represent all the Turkish troops in the country, and they are naturally scattered in small detachments and very much exposed to a sudden raid Of Bedouin, who are extremely mobile and capable of doing serious damage by a raid in force. Tebuk is an oasis with good water-supply and a large depot of material and provisions for the troops farther south. Akhdar has also good water; at Muadhem is a little, and then a long gap of waterless country to Medain-i-Salih. Water is everything, and intermediate posts and working parties have to be supplied with water and provisions by train daily. Consequently the capture of Tebuk and Akhdar by a raiding force would stop all work, and probably result in the death from thirst or starvation of practically all the troops. Between Maan (good water) and Mudevvere is a long waterless stretch, which would make reinforcement difficult. The Turks have not attempted any defensive measures at either Tebuk or Akhdar; the depots are quite open with desert all round, and could easily be raided by Arabs who meant business. The neighbouring small tribes—sections of the Beni Atie—are all hostile, and isolated soldiers are constantly cut off or robbed, although up to the present no serious raid has been made on the line. Turkish officers I spoke to declared they were perfectly safe, and there was no danger of attack by Arabs in any force, and with 5,000 men available and others which could arrive from Damascus, they thought they could deal with anything the Arabs could do. This is only on the surface, and I know that they are seriously alarmed at the prospect of a raid by Ibn Saoud's forces from Nejd, and I heard from a good source that such an attack may take place soon when he has completed his preparations and mobilized his men, which he is now doing in Kassim.6 I heard from many sources down the line that Ihn Saoud was now com pletely in the ascendant; he had managed to carry off 20,000 camels from Ihn Eashid, and that the latter was defeated and discredited—' yatmishor,' he has lain down before Ihn Saoud. There does not seem to have been a decisive battle, but a series of encounters, in which the Hashid lost men and camels. Ibn Saoud is now in Kassim preparing for another advance, and it is this which disquiets the Turks. I have also a rumour that Mubarak, the Sheikh of Koweit, is trying to patch up the quarrel between Ibn Saoud and Ibn Rashid ; should he succeed, it would obviously be very serious for the Turks, as it is the intention to employ the combined forces against the railway. As you know, in the past two years the Turks have steadily lost prestige. As the result of Ahmed Feizi Pasha's expedition with ten battalions from Baghdad in 1905, a Treaty of Arrangement was made by which the Turkish flag was hoisted in Hail, and Ibn Saoud was appointed Kaimakam of Eiadh, with other appointments in Kassim, Anaize, and Boreide, implying Turkish sovereignty over these districts where it has not previously existed. Garrisons were stationed in Hail, Kassim, Anaize, and Boreide, but they have gradually melted away by desertions towards Koweit, and generally through want of provisions or stores. I met an officer at Tebuk whose brother had been one of the last to march out of Kassim, and he had actually some times to subsist on locusts. Sami Pasha (the Turkish Mutessarif or Governor of Kassim), after repeated appeals to Constantinople for help, supplies, or even instructions, last February, decided that things were hopeless, and retired with the last remnants of the garrison on Medina without orders ; when he reported his arrival to the Porte, they said he had better stay where he was. Thus, as matters stand at present, Turkish prestige has suffered greatly, and there is nothing to prevent Ibn Saoud making a descent on the Railway, should he manage to combine the tribes against the Turks. I am told (by Turkish officer) that the Arab mode of fighting is to have about one-fourth of the force employed as cavalry scouting well in front, while the main body are camel-men, each camel mounting two men one behind the other, and carrying a skin of water, some provisions, and cartridges. Such a force is naturally extremely mobile. They are all well-armed with Martinis, the same weapon as the Turkish troops have, and against them there are only the scattered posts and working parties strung out along the railway, with the main depot of Tebuk practically defenceless. The camel-men dismount to fire, and advance to the attack when they have got close enough. I cannot trace any confirmation of the report that Sultan Ibn Hamud Ibn Rashid, the reigning Emir, has been assassinated by the old Khaznader of Abdul Aziz. There has been a lot of killing done in the family principally by Sultan himself, so that a mistake might easily have occurred in the name. Even if it did occur, it would not alter the situation very much as regards Ibn Saoud ; none of the Ibn Eashid family are worth much now in the field, while Ibn Saoud is said to be a very capable leader, who has lately gained very greatly in prestige. Ibn Saoud is the real Emir of Nejd, being a direct descendant of the Wahabi Emirs, w r hile Ibn Eashid is at most only Etnir of Hail, or Sheikh of the Jebel Shammer tribe. Constant small reinforcements are being sent down from here as working parties; for instance, in the train I travelled down were eighty Albanians of the guard at Constantinople sentenced to one year's labour on the line for some Palace mutiny, and other trains had gangs of Syrian recruits and labourers going down.The train I came back in had some fifty wretched poor fellows down with dysentery, tpyhoid, and scurvy, just packed anyhow on open platform waggons in a blazing sun, without a doctor or attendants of any kind. As I was on the same kind of truck myself with two Turkish officers,! could do little or nothing to kelp, beyond getting thera water and giving them a few oranges and things. Some of them were practically done for when we reached Maan, and every train we passed on its way up had crowds of sick on board. I met three deserters from the Yemen seated under a tree in Tebuk they had trudged along all the way through Mecca and Medina the soldiers and officers had given them bread now and then as they passed by Akhdar an d Tebuk. They were not allowed on the train, and as we steamed out of Tebuk I saw them tramping along in the sand, hoping some day to reach Damascus. One told me hewasaLaz, from Trebizond, and hoped eventually to reach there . I found an Italian engineer at Tebuk, who put me up; there are about 300 Italians, Greeks, and Montenegrins employed near Akhdar doing bridging work, as the Turkish engineers are not quite good enough as stone-masons. I was very fortunate in Tebuk in obtaining a copy of the contoured survey of the rnoVo o f rom Maan right down to near Medina, which will come in very useful, 1 hope. I also saw the survey of the Jedda-Mecca line, but could not copy that. Erom Medina to Mecca no survey has yet been made. I managed to find Meisner Pasha, the Engineer-in-Chief of the line, here on my return which was very unfortunate, as he goes down to Maan to-morrow. I had two long talks with him, and he gave me a lot of very interesting information about Syrian railways generally, the Baghdad Railway, and what he intends to do on the Mecca line. They intend first of all to finish up to Medina, after which thev intend to take on minor schemes such as the Jedda-Mecca line, the port at Haifa, the Amman-Salt branch, and some minor Syrian branches. Another project which Izzet Pasha (the Sultan's Chamberlain, and head of the Hedjaz Railway Commission) is pushing now is an extension from Angora by Sivas and Erzingan to Erzerum and the Russian frontier. The hope to make it on the same system as the Hedjaz Railway by military labour, but as yet nothing is definite, although Izzet is working at the scheme. Meisner said he hoped to get on it, as he was tired of the climate of South Arabia. As regards tlie Prencli Syrian railways, lie told me it was practically assured that they would join and form part of the Baghdad Concession when the new arrangements were concluded. He has promised me a contoured ma.p of the line from here to Maan, and also the Haifa branch, which he will send me through the Consul here, so that will make the map of the line complete. He also drew me a little sketch of his proposed scheme for a port at Haifa. He said there was absolutely no intention now of making the Maan-Akaba or any other line towards Akaba. After all it was quite useless as a port, there was practically no fresh water except _ some brackish springs on the beach, and besides there seemed to be hmglish objections. I am leavino- to-morrow morning for Homs by road through Nebk, after which I shall go' down to Tripoli, and then probably along the coast-road to ® e * ru ^' Yonrs sincerely. P. R.

Inclosure 5 in No. 1. Major Mamsell to Colonel Count Gleiohen. Tripoli; Bear Gleieheu, Jpril 34 ' lm - I heard on leaving Damasous tbat Ibn Rasli id was trying hard to obtain some alliance or protection that would give him a chance asainst Ibn Saoud. He tried to get the Druzes, but they would have none of the idea, as obviously ttiey could not do much outside their own district of Jebel Druz. He also lias the idea of obtaining British protection, and the Consul told me lie wished to send a letter to the King, but nothing has come of it yet. I went with the Consular dragoman (as a tourist wanting to 20 to Hail) to see an Arab merchant, Bassam, who is in touch with that country, and found • This is Akaba-esh-Shamie of the map; the Akaba on the Ked Sea is Aiaba-el-Misrie. f Line open to this point for traffic. J Construction trains to this point, § Work in progress.9 him a very strong partisan of Ibn EasMd. He thought in some way I set British protection for him. He told me a great deal about routes and the country, and confirmed the news that Ibn Saoud was now in Kassim collecting his forces for another moye. I saw Emir Ali, son of the great Abdul Kader, of Algeria, who knows a good deal about this country, and is closely in touch with Izzet Pasha, the Sultan's Chamberlain, who is a native of Damascus, and the principal Director of the Hedjaz Railway. Curiously enough I found there an o&amp;cer ot the Moroccan army (rank of major) who had just arrived, it is said, to see it ne could get any assistance from Emir Ali, which is very doubtful. Izzet Pasha has not forgotten his native town, and has just introduced electric tramways and light worked by some falls in the River Abana. ine streets are narrow and the people slow to move, the result being a boy was run over, upon which the inhabitants rose and smashed three tram-cars to pieces. Izzet is also building a new station for the Hedjaz Railway in the centre of the town, and a large hotel adjoining. I could hear nothing of any disturbances at Medina except some attacks on the pilgrim caravan which are of annual occurrence. The Grand Shenf of Mecca is all-powerful between Mecca and Medina, he is energetic, and liked, does not care much for the Turks, and would assist Ibn Saoud it he made a successful move against the railway. The powerful Beni Harb tribe between Medina and Mecca give a lot of trouble, and at present even the telegraph, much less the railway survey, cannot pass through their country. But Ibn Saoud is the chief storm 'Centre ; if he makes a successful move against the railway, the Beni Harb, the Beni and the Grand Sherif would probably all be found on his side, and the lurka would have a lot of trouble. The Damascus-Homs road is passable for wheels, and useful if Homa were occupied from the coast, and it was intended to push down from there to Damascus. The maps do not show this road or the country along it very well, so I have sketched it in afresh connecting up when possible with the Anti Lebanon survey. Water is rather scarce, but at Nebk and Kuteife are good snrines, and at other points .is a small supply. From Homs I came down the road to Trinoli, which follows ah easy way through the hills round the northern end of the Lebanon. The road is well kept up, and is the only way fit for wheels as the country on either side is covered with masses of round stones which 'make movement off the road very difficult, while the spurs of the Lebanon or Ansarie Mountains afford no passage. I went over two positions on the way, one near Hadidi a strong one. I have been three days in Tripoli studying the country, possible camping grounds, and positions covering a landing. The most difficult problem is to get away from the masses of orange gardens on the promontory. However, I found an excellent site near a large spring about IJ miles north of the town, and a good covering position from Deir Ammar to the sea, across the Homs road. The Lebanon is rather disturbed, and I came down from Horns in company with a Redif battalion from Adana, which was to garrison Tripoli. I got some unique photos of the Turkish Redif and his equipment, or rather want of it. I shall get on to Beirut and then home by Port Said, as I have now finished. Yours sincerely, , E. R. MAUNSELL.

This is merely local conjecture to account for the action Sheikh Mobarak is taking, but it is probably founded on fact. &lt;5 Fortunatelv, I decided to visit Sheikh Mobarak this morning and he opened the conversation by remarking that Nejd affairs were causing him a good deal of anxiety and that he was sure that the present movement would lead to the disastrous result of an occupation of El _ Kasim by the Turkish troops, as Sultan bin Rasid and the people of Boraida were in no way far-seeing. The people of Boraida wanted nothing but peace and Sultan bin Rashid was anxious to obtain recognition by the Turkish authorities and to secure himself against Bin Sa'ud's depredations. They would probably therefore call in the Turk, not perceiving that he, in the end, would be a harder master than Bin ba ud. a Accordingly Sheikh Mobarak has arranged to despatch Abdul Aziz u' Hassan, a native of a hamlet, Turaif, near Boraida, to bring the Umtair back again and to persuade all parties to keep quiet. r Abdul Aziz ul Hassan has been frequently alluded to in my reports. He is Sheikh Mobarak's chief zikat collector and was the Amir ul Haj of the last Koweit pilgrim caravan. He is respected and of some influence, but I do not altogether share Sheikh Mobarak's optimism which persuades the latter that he will ^e successful in the difficult negotiations which he has to pursue. 6. He is, as I have said before, to persuade all parties to ,^ p ., ^P^ e J to order the Bedouins back again ; to guarantee, on the part of Sheikh Mobara , Bin Sa'ud in the possession of his territory, and Boraida; say El Kasim against the agression of both parties, and Sultan bin Rashid in the possession of Hail, and to'state that Sheikh Mobarak will visit with his displeasure anybody who presumes to stir beyond the limit he has marked out for them. 7 It is a fine ambitious project worthy of the genius of the man who con ceived it and, if there is any one, who can enforce it, he may fairly be regarded as the Nejd ' deus exmachina ' who would restore peace to that distressful country. 8. Boraida will be ready enough to come to terras, but Sultan has already declared that he counts not on their assistance but their neutra ity.2 There remains the Umtair for it is not likely that the remainder of Sultan's following will pay much attention to Sheikh Mobarak's wishes. Faisul ud Dawish has sent a written challenge to Bin Sa'ud and declares that, so long as 10 horsemen will follow him, he will fight Bin Sa'ud. Too much attention need not be paid to Bedouin boasting, but a man who has had a bullet through his shoulder, which is barely healed, is apt to feel a bit sore about it, and the attack on the Umtair at Majma'a was hardly justifiable. Practically, the success of Mobarak's mission depends on this man's attitude, ^ 9. Everybody in Koweit knows all about this mission, which fact in itself is significant. I had not been away from Mobarak two hours before I was informed of the facts from two different sources. People are not wanting who say that Mobarak is afraid of Bin Rashid's success and does not wish for a repetition of the situation of 1901. 10. I felt myself unable to make any reply to Sheikh Mobarak beyond that the situation as described by him would be reported to my Government and to remind him of their caution that they did not approve of his interference in Central Arabian politics. I could not say how far the despatch of Abdul Aziz ul Hassan, a native of El Kasim, to El Kasim would be regarded by them as an interference of the nature they deprecated. g, c« b* p., sitnhu—no c-433 f. d.—26-9-07.—14—,].d.3=^ Telegram# TO 9 Foreign , Simla • i , (Chit copy to Resident Shiraz; No: 538 f dated 17-9-07 • (?)• Nejd affairs • On the 3rd instant Sheiku MubaraK informed Knox that he proposed sending, a messenger 'to keep the peace between bin Rashid and bin Saood by guaranteeing latter in the possession of his territory 9 the former in that of Hail, an d El Kasim against both, and to persuade Bedouins of both sides to abandon war# Knox re plied that he would make a report to his Governmant and reminded the Sheikh of previous caution against inter ference in the affairs of Central Arabia by Koweit.
