We in turn give the news as we have read it, hoping that it is not true, or at least that it has been exaggerated. We shall see when the truth is revealed whether it is true or false or Just a fancy.

D.C.Wo.C/779-4/13 &amp; The 15th October 1937, My dear Mr. Caroe, Belgrave informed Eie today that he had been told by Hussein Yateem who is a well-to-do Mreheat of Bahrain that the night before last a statement was made in Arabic on the wirelees from Bert, the Italian 8tation f to the effect that the Shaikh of Kuwait had succeeded in settling the difficulties between Bahrain and Qatar and that he had made peace between the two states* 2* Uhfortun&amp;taly neither Belgrave nor myself heard the broadcast and aa far as I know nobody made an accurate note at that time . I shall be most Intereeted to discover where the infomation regarding Bahrein and Qatar is being obtained 1 have made enquiries locally and Belgrave also hsa done so and we have not been able to discover anybody who ie likely to have informed the Italians of tbs Shaikh of Kuwait's possible visit to Bahrain and his desire to Intervene as a mediator between Bahrain and Qatar. In fact the possl» bility of the Shaikh of Kuwait coming to Bahrain was only known to Belgrave f the senior members of the kuling Family and myself. 3. I am sending a copy of this letter to Gaury in the hope that he may possibly be able to obtain informa tion regarding the source of information from Kuwait. Yours sincerely, SdA T. Hickinbotham. The Hobble Hr. C.K. Caroe f I.C.3. f C.I*E. t Political Resident in the Persian Gulf* Buahire•/-N It may interest you to know that on Wednesday night there was a broadcast from an Italian station at Berlin Arabic / to the effect that the Shaikh of Kuwait had succeeded in his task as arbitrator between the Shaikh of Bahrain and the Shaikh of Qatar and had arranged a settlement between them. I should be very grateful if you would endeavour to discover whether these stories about the internal disorders and external troubles in Bahrain originate in Kuwait. I have talked to Belgrave about it and we both consider it most unlikely that they have their origin in Bahrain. From the prominence which is given to the great virtues of His Highness the Shaikh of Kuwait, I am inclined to believe that they come from his own terri tory. I talked to the Shaikh and he was rather annoyed as he considered it a piece of impertinende on the part of the Shaikh of Kuwait to wish to interfere and even to suggest that there was anything for him to interfere in in Bahrain. We have no internal disorders of any sort at all and the minor labour troubles at the oil works are of no particular concern, but if these articles continue and these broad casts are made, I think it very probable that we shall have trouble at the oil works and I am very anxious to put a stop to them. It may interest you to know that the Shaikh wrote a letter by H.M.S. Enterprise to the Shaikh of Kuwait and showed it to me before he sent it. There was no mention in/- Captain G.S.E. de Gaury, M.C., Political Agent, Kuwait- 2 - n in it of the receipt of any letter from Kuwait nor was there the slightest suggestion that Kuwait should come here either as a friend or as a peacemaker. It seems that the Shaikh of Bahrain is inclined to believe that the Shaikh of Kuwait is slightly unbalanced. You would have seen the demi-official letter which I wrote to Caroe about this question but I thought I should write to you a personal note as well. I am leaving here on the 27th by the Fast Mail and hope to see you for half an hour or so on my way to Basrah where I presume I shall have the opportunity of meeting the Consul there with whom I have had considera ble correspondence.EXPRESS LETTER (AIR MAIL).

Mohammad iiabib is an Iraqi by birth who has been living in Koweit for many years ana is now considered by ihe local authorities to be xioweiti. Mis father established himself as a small tobacconist here. Ie is correspondent of A1 Nos, and its alternative as Sijil, a ^sra I*ewr&gt;paper. He left hurriedly for Iraq the day I returned here from India, the 50th September, but has since returned. 3. You ask why he takes such an active interest in Bahrain affairs. I give you the following facts which may be, and almost certainly are, relevant. He wrote articles against the Bhaikh of howeit at one time, suddenly their tone changed, and they became full of praise for the Bhaikh. 'Anti-Bahrain' articles began to appear. In Iraq 'Journalistic blackmail' is I believe not at all uncommon. 4 . I spoke to the Bhai/ch about him today and said that I had heard that he was writing undesirable and untrue articles about Bahrain. He said immediately that Mohammed Habib could not be writing such articles. He was under his control, and he would not tolerate articles against the interests of his brother the Bhaikh of Bahrain. 5. I do not pretend to know how the Bhaikh could be so certain that he was not writing the articles but he was immediately very emphatic about it. H.Weightman Esquire, Political Agent, BAHRAIN.
