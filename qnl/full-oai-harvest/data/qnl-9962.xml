In addition to the property itself, the belongings inside it are also discussed including a large number of rifles and ammunition.The correspondence is mainly between British officials, primarily those of the Political Agency in Kuwait and the Political Residency in Bushire. However, the file also contains a limited amount of correspondence with the Ruler of Kuwait, Shaikh Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah, a Basra-based lawyer who represented Shaikh Khaz'al's heirs named Muhammad Ahmad and the heirs themselves. Much of this correspondence is in Arabic accompanied by translations in English.On folio 88, the file contains a blueprint plan of Shaikh Khaz'als property (or 'palace') in Kuwait.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Property</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0000be#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0000be#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0000be#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
